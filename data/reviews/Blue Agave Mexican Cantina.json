{"text":"My husband and I dined here twice within one week to seek solace after spending a lot of time in the Expo store down the way, where we were setting the wheels in motion for a huge kitchen remodel. Happy to report that our enchiladas and tacos provided sufficient comfort. The sauces are especially distinctive and good. There will be one more visit to Expo, after which I'm sure I'll head in the same direction -- and add a double margarita to my order."}
{"text":"Blue Agave has a really cool ambiance. I loved the Mexican influenced artwork on the walls and the netted off area when you walk in with all the lights that made me wish it was warm enough to sit outside underneath it. 

The service, however, was not the best. Service wasn't prompt when we walked in.  We weren't sure if you seat yourself or not, as there is no sign, but eventually someone noticed us and sat us down. Throughout the meal our server was attentive, but lacked enthusiasm. 

We tried the guacamole as an appetizer. I'm a harsh critic when it comes to my favorite food item so this may be a little brutal. It was fresh, but lacked flavor. It tasted like a mushed up avacado. I added my lime from my margarita to it and some salt and then it was much better. I would never order that again. Also, their house salsa served with their chips seemed a little off to me. I kept tasting a smoke flavor that made me think they actually added liquid smoke to it. I like liquid smoke in my barbecue, but please keep it away from my salsa!

The Rio Grande margarita was okay. I really enjoyed it when I made sure to lick the salt first, but on it's own I thought it was a little too sweet. They have a special on their margaritas for $9.  I understand that they have a happy hour also with better deals that would be wise to check out.

Intrigued, I tried their Ultimate Chimmichanga that claimed to be the best of the valley at one point in time.  It was huge! The pork was flavorful and I enjoyed the little 'kick' I got from the heat of the chipolte and jalepeno sauce served on it. I would not say it was the best I've ever had, but it had potential. For $15 you should definitely think about splitting this entree.  The prices seemed a little high for Mexican food.  However, you need to keep in mind that the location in general has overpriced restaurants surrounding it. Also, it's right across the street from Whole Foods. Enough said.

I agree with some of the other reviews written, that this is not the go to place for Mexican food. I would try it again making sure I hit happy hour and the better deals during those time slots. They do have happy hour every day of the week, which makes it convenient for everyone. That is an ingenious idea."}
{"text":"My wife and I have had dinner here several times. We love the food, the margaritas and the ambiance!! An we will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times -- it's ok.  Convenient to my work and the happy hour prices are decent.  The house marg is ok  but kinda small and with LOTS of ice.  The happy hour bar food was ok - nothing special.

The outdoor seating (when the weather is nice) is ok - it faces a parking lot, as does most outdoor seating in AZ.  Also when the weather is accommodating, they open the bar doors to the outside which gives it a cute look / feel. 

Overall - it's just ok. The food is pretty basic and if i used a toaster oven for my costco chimis / flautas - it would be the same."}
{"text":"Wish we had read the reviews on here before we had taken a chance on this place... Definitely not a place you would return to for the food, that's for sure.

We were charged $2.25 each for sodas/tea, $5 for a bowl of clearly Kraft Macaroni n Cheese for our toddler... 2 Entrées at $12.99-15.99... It was $42 before tip for 2 adults and a toddler... all for very blah, unremarkable food. They even charged an extra $1 for a couple extra flour tortillas, a \"service\" that should be thrown in for free.

Our server disappeared quite a bit, and the female owner/manager or whomever was more attentive to us... we saw her even have to prompt him to come over and tend to us at one point.

Again, this is basically a sports bar fronting as a mexican restaurant... we won't be fooled again!"}
{"text":"I gave this place a second try after a rough start the first go round. The food was great the first time but service a bit spotty. After conversing with manager and his staff, about our first experience they went  out of their way to make the second go round flawless. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"This restaurant was suggested by friends  (from Detroit!). The drinks and service were good but the food was very disappointing. The chips were commercial, the \"crispy\" taco shell was grainy like it was from the local grocery store and the fillings were copious but bland. Additionally, the refried beans were pasty Rosarita's out of a can! Arghh! The enchilada used a double tortilla which made it quite doughy and the menu was limited and we couldn't substitute anything so we ended up ordering two dishes and splitting. All in all, if you're looking for western style or Tex-Mex, I think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. The food is good. For all these years, it has been the same wait staff and you better hope you catch them on a good day when they actually want to provide good, attentive service rather than actively ignore your table. If you end up with the short fella as your server, you may as well resign yourself to getting up and getting everything yourself (refills, sides, extras) as you will most likely walk by him hanging out by a register rather than checking in on tables. 
Despite the hit or miss service, I will return for casual dining and good food."}
{"text":"Food was ok but the service sucked!! We had to flag down the staff on more than one occasion once to order and once to pay. Both of our entrees were alright, nothing to brag about. It has a nice patio."}
{"text":"This was not my first time at Blue Agave. We went a few years ago and weren't really impressed. The Yelp deal helped me try it out again and I can honestly say I am pleased with our decision. Everything was great!  They have an awesome menu with some items that seemed slightly different than your standard Mexican restaurant choices.  We were very pleased with the food and service. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food (great portion sizes also!), and staff was wonderful to us and our one year old baby. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Check my profile, I have never felt the need to give a negative review...until now.  We stopped by last night, and my recommendation is stay as far away from this place as possible. The attitude of the bartender was terrible. Horrible. Insulting, really. She needs a remedial trip to customer service school. The food may be great, and I am sure there are other staff who are courteous, professional and kind. However, this female bartender was NOT, and I will not be returning. 

We left, went across the street to Bourbon Jacks and it was great! Like night and day."}
{"text":"Went with family and was disappointed in the food.  Server was very nice but the quality of food was very poor. We ordered chicken lettuce wraps and it tasted like the chicken wasn't cooked all the way and was quite cold. Chicken tacos with a slimy feel to chicken and it had to be frozen before being cooked.  Had to wait for a while on kids order which was wrong. Server did discount the meal but won't go back because food quality was poor and made me sick later. Hate to ever write a bad review but this was not a great experience."}
{"text":"Service was okay, food was very good and had great flavor.  Went for lunch and there was only one server taking care of the entire place.  Restaurant had a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Not so good.  Ordered fajitas.  Chicken was dry. Lettuce was brown. Not much flavor.   Chips were decent. Basic all the way."}
{"text":"My husband and I Love Blue Agave. They have the most amazing fajitas. They set the bar very high for Mexican food. Their chicken tortilla soup is the BEST!!!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday man. Amazing. Delicious house margaritas and food, pleasant staff, decent prices.  Definitely recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab some chips and salsa and watch a ball game! Big screens everywhere! Our waitress was also very sweet!"}
{"text":"Chicken was very dry and I had a hard time cutting the chicken even with a steak knife. Chips were nice and warm, salsa was just okay. Service was good I will give it 2 stars."}
{"text":"I am not easily impressed with Mexican food. My sister has been telling me about this place for months. When I got here, the waitress Dodie was friendly and quick with service. My sister and I shared a meal: Tres Enchiladas. Two words: oh my! It's very delicious. I am definitely coming back here again tomorrow and the day after before going back home to Austin. I'm super impressed!"}
{"text":"Great Place for Mexican food and to watch or listen to the football games.  Everything was great, service, quality taste, portion size.  I do recommend you order their hotter sauce, much more flavorful than their standard sauce.  I had the Fajitas (steak and shrimp combo) and my wife had the fish tacos.  The Yelp deal made it even better."}
{"text":"Stale chips...bland salsa....Fish tacos were blah, too. The \"Oaxaca\" sauce that accompanied them tasted strangely like bottled American salad dressings. Blah rice. Beans were just okay. Nothing really held my interest in terms of taste. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing or was there on a bad night.... There are a lot of good reviews.

Suggestions to restaurant: include fresh herbs and peppers....nothing tasted really fresh to me.

Service was very slow....inattentive...

Restaurant was clean. 

I wonder if drinks would be a better option here over food."}
{"text":"Been here 1x and will not go back. Mexican food here is not Mexican food. They had store bought taco shells and tortillas. Ugh what a disappointment."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and trying to find a Mexican restaurant a friend recommended on Mayo just to discover it was shut down. Bummer because now we were craving Mexican food. Pulled up Yelp on phn which led us here and we were not disappointed! The server was lovely and attentive and recommended the Baja Enchiladas (shrimp filled enchiladas with a yummy chipotles sauce) and they did not disappoint, simply delicious! My husband also loved his dinner (Baja Platter)!"}
{"text":"First time here

Service: great!!!! Kelly was welcoming and very friendly and fast on service.

Food: ok. My wife's nachos were great. Big fan of them. The ribs though said they were very spicy but not at all. They were juicy so that's good but I love spice so a little disappointed on that. 

The worst part of this visit was how hot it was in this restaurant. I don't get hot that easily and was very uncomfortable sitting with my wife and 2 year old son. I will be back but seriously, turn down the AC!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been meaning to try this place for so long and finally went there. It was DELISH!  It's a nice \"mom and pop\" kinda place. The prices are reasonable and the portions are a good size.  We've gone back there 3 times!  You can sign up for their VIP club and get 20% off your first bill after you sign up.  It's kid friendly.  If you wanna go and hang and watch a game or something, they have a great happy hour!  I plan on going back there often!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night after a movie - lured by their \"show movie ticket for 1/2 price off second meal\".  Wish we had read Blake B's review before we went.  
We passed by the the place many times before, but this was the first time we actually stopped in.  Keep in mind that the lure was the food discount offer, not drinks, so we were there for the food.  Bad move... you need the drinks to forget the food.  
It was a Saturday night, but the place was almost empty - that should have been a warning sign to us.
When the menu proudly announces that they serve tamales from \"The Tamale Store\", it makes you wonder if they actually make food or just reheat food from other establishments.  We decided to try their ultimate chimichanga and the aforementioned tamales.  
The complimentary salsa had a nice spicy bite to it, but also had an off taste that I just couldn't place.  I kept sampling it to identify the strange taste, but eventually gave up; whatever it was, it threw the flavor off.  
The ultimate chimi was a good size, but was comprised of a lot of tortilla.  The guacamole provided with it was starting to turn brown - indicating it was made much earlier in the evening and had been sitting for a bit. Taste-wise, the chimi was so-so; I've had much better ones elsewhere - even locally.  
The tamales were good, but then again, it wasn't made by the restaurant.  I can just go to the Tamale Store (good thing that it's a local establishment) and pick up some directly.  The mexican rice accompanying it was a bit on the dry side.
Price-wise, it was on the high side for mexican food; certainly not worth the value even with the discount applied.  
Ambiance - what ambiance?  We were just about the only patrons in the place!  Fake decor elements don't make ambiance (to me, anyway).  To be fair, I have passed the place before with people drinking on the outside patio and watching the tv - if that's what you're looking for, then go for it.
I'm stretching to give it 2 stars... expensive for what you get, and what you get (in my case anyway) wasn't even something they prepared themselves.  Drinkers might give it a higher rating, but don't expect a lot when it comes to the food."}
{"text":"Service and food were way above average.
Fish Tacos and mixed steak/shrimp fajitas were made to perfection- easily the best we have had anywhere.
There is an early bird special on small plate appetizers and drinks that is very well priced.
Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Tasty tortilla chips and salsa were a welcome start to our meal.  Margaritas were tasty and good value on happy hour.  Enjoyed enchiladas.  Wish they had more vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch. It seem to be fairly highly priced however, there was only one other table eating at the time. When I asked for my bill I receive the other tables bill which he had already ran my credit card. We asked them to correct that. I found out a couple days later that I not only paid for my meal I was charged also for the other meal for the other person in the restaurant. I went in the following day and I'll talk to a manager and I was approached by a server she asks what the problem was and I showed her the receipt she looked at me like I was weird and went back to her table and started serving again I stayed at the door for another 10 minutes and then just walked out so I have no more time to pursue this so I guess they just double charged me and probably the other table as well so I won't be back"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times, hoping that it'd get better, but it never does.

The food is greasy and very unappealing.  Well, if you like bland, flavorless grease, then it's ok.  There *is* a difference between a hard taco and a soft taco.  When they bring you the wrong kind and you politely point it out, then *do* offer to remake it for you, but they act like it's the biggest burden in the world.  

While waiting for our order, I put my elbows on the table.  The table was so greasy, my arm slid across the table.  Ewww, gross.  Use more than an old dirty rag to wipe it down please.

There's one waitress that's very rude, and somehow I seem to get her.  I did notice that on my last visit, my debit card was charged and extra time for something I didn't order.  Classy.  I wonder how many times that goes and people just don't check their bank statements.  Luckily my bank is fixing that one.

I'm still in search of a good Mexican eatery."}
{"text":"This place is past it's prime and is in desperate need of a facelift, both service wise & fixtures and furnishings. 
Poor service, staff were more interested in their smartphones than the guests. 
Had to request multiple times for soda and salsa refills, food was of low quality, very basic. 
Cleanliness was poor, table and seating full of crumbs, there was a big rip in the bench seat upholstery. 
Server rolled her eyes when I asked for a glass for my beer. 
Will not return."}
{"text":"Nothing extraordinary here. Was notified during a previous visit that their guacamole contained sour cream, even tho it is not listed in the ingredients under the guacamole appetizer on the menu."}
{"text":"Crispy tacos, enchiladas, chips/salsa, all top notch.  Nice patio, good service, all around good joint."}
{"text":"Great service,  excellent food.  The chicken enchiladas with creamy jalapeño  sauce was so good,  my new go to Mexican joint!!"}
{"text":"Dinner was delicious! Fish tacos were excellent .  Dinner was perfect. Margaritas were just ok."}
{"text":"Don't understand why providing good service is so difficult .. Bartender rude.  Didn't eat so can't tell u about food. Never got that far."}
{"text":"I love hot spicy Mexican food, and I was surprised to find a really hot item on the menu. There was only one, but it was good. I ordered the Spicy Boneless Pork Ribs which came with tortilla, rice and choice of beans. I ordered the Black Beans. It was all very good. The service was good, especially for a large crowd of 20. Servers were friendly and fast. And the real test of a good Mexican place is the margarita. I passed on the house and ordered one of the specialty margs, and it was really good. This is a good place."}
{"text":"excellent food and service here last night.  we tried the Mesa location when we were in town last year and really enjoyed that one too.  not expensive.  highly recommend"}
{"text":"My favorite chips and salsa in Phoenix.  My taste in Mexican food restaurants is highly based on their Chips and Salsa.  This place is great!  The spicy boneless port ribs are awesome, and the burritos are just as good.  Very nice atmosphere and a comfortable place for a good Mexican meal!"}
{"text":"See A.Z.'s posting on 3-8-2015. He/she must be referring to the same bartender we had last night on 3-13-2015. The food here is very good, but the service and attitude was terrible. It didn't used to be that way. Heads up to management: start hiring top notch staff or you will continue to bleed your regular clientele like us."}
{"text":"Great alcohol selection  (margaritas!)and amazing food and service! Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This is the second (or third) time I have been to Blue Agave and the first time this year.  Once again my husband and I were very pleased with our meal. The chips were thin and crispy and the salsa was thick with a mild kick and a chipotle flavor.  Hubby had the Owner's Chimichanga.  He liked it a lot. The only odd thing about it is that the menu said it had chicken in it and it seemed to have (also have?) beef.  I had the vegetarian enchiladas.  The vegetables were zucchini, mushrooms and bell pepper.  I am not a big lover of zucchini but the enchiladas were good.  The menu suggests that they are not spicy but they had some zip to them.  Black beans were made better by adding some salsa.  Portions are large.  Hubby and I each took home half of our meal for lunch tomorrow.  It was nice that they had a SanTan HopShock IPA on tap, in addition to the more common beers found in Mexican restaurants.  To top it off, I paid $15 for a $30 coupon on Living Social for food and drink.  Total out of pocket, including a 20 oz beer, was $26.  We will definitely be back when we return to Phoenix next year."}
{"text":"OKay I won't lie to you I went here originally because I got a two for one certificate from the Entertainment Book. And I have eaten here 5 times at full price ever since. Everything both my wife and I have tried is great especially the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp. This is Gourmet Mexican food at regular prices. Great atmosphere.. Great Bar.... Good Sports Bar also. I love the outside seating especially Spring and Fall in Snottsdale.Try it you will Like it!"}
{"text":"Writing me review a little late, but better late than never! A good friend of mine and I visit here every once in a while to grab dinner after work. He always get's the fish tacos, and I've had various things off the menu. I've yet to have anything I didn't enjoy, the burrito was larger than a football and very flavorful.   The shredded beef taco's are definitely not the quality of tin foil wrapped street tacos, but still quite delicious.   My only real complaint is the salsa. It's quite bland without much kick, the warm chips are awesome though!  Definitely a place we will continue to go for convenience and knowing the food is reliable. Oh, and the staff is also really friendly!"}
{"text":"Based on friends' recommendations we used Blue Agave to cater to our office's grand opening event, serving some 75 people.   Value pricing and delivery ahead of schedule.   Service was awesome and their rep helped setup the venue after he arrived.   The food was delicious, and we still get queries from our clients asking who we had cater our event.   Really killer salsa (and I'm a salsa snob) combined with tasty dishes made for a successful event.   Whether it's a casual dinner out for yourself, or if you need catering for large groups, you can't go wrong with Blue Agave.   Do yourself a favor and stop in or order their catering today!!!"}
{"text":"Recently came here for happy hours and dinner with some collegues. The food was disgusting and made me sick, I think I might have got food posioning. I ordered chicken lettuce wrap, the chicken was over cooked and was overly chunky with some stale salsa (it smelled and tasted that way EEEKK.)
Our waitress was pissed for some weird reason and kept making faces when people asked her for additional stuff! Terrible place, will never visit and definetly wont recommend anybody to go there and get sick!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great time at the Blue Agave Mexican Cantina!  The bartender was so friendly.  I can't remember her name but she was from North Dakota!  The food was very good and the beer was so tasty after golfing all day!  The $10 coupon was another bonus!  How sweet is that???  Buy $20 worth of food for $10!!  Thanks so much!!  Yes, we will return!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  The food is awesome but if you do not like spicy food I would not recommend it.  There food can be a bit on the spicy side, I love it but not everyone would."}
{"text":"Love the food here! My favorites are the tacos and their Mexican pizza. The chips and salsa are really good, too. Atmosphere is easy and relaxing. This is one of our regular Go To places for our family. And we enjoy bringing guests from out of town. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I used a Groupon there and the food was decent for sure but the service was not good. They argued with us about the Groupon for ten minutes and even though the manager agreed we were correct, they still didn't fix the issue. Too bad cause the food was good and would have come back for sure...."}
{"text":"I was celebrating Cinco de Mayo at Blue Agave on Friday night. After having a few drinks and an appetizer, I paid my $24 bill plus tip and left. Had a good time and enjoyed the atmosphere. Then this morning I woke up to a $130 charge from Blue Agave, 3 days after I had already been charged the $24. So how did that happen? I have called into the manager and have yet to hear from him. It clearly wasn't a mistake. Since both were charged to my account at different times. Buyers beware. Take cash next time!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks! One of our favorite places to go to satisfy Mexican food craving. You know the place is good when chips and salsa are the bomb!"}
{"text":"Literally my #1 good spot for Mexican that isn't too heavy.  Great margaritas and theres never a wait for seating.  Nice patio, bar, or dining room seating options.

Pros:
Organic margarita
Sonoran rolls
Ultimate chimi
Grilled fish tacos
Requested hot sauce
Friendly team service
Great parking and location off 101 & Scottsdale rd

Cons:
House chips not homemade
House salsa is bland, prob not homemade

The hunny and I here keep coming back here each month to get the Sonoran rolls or grilled fish tacos- so yummy!  We made a date night a few times at blue agave and then picked up dessert from whole foods across the street . :)"}
{"text":"Chiming was amazing carnet Asada pizza was dry and boring and felt used by our server also well we're finishing our server was eager to check what he's tip was instead one of getting us Togo bag and containers nothing special"}
{"text":"My wife and I go here frequently 2-3 times a month. Usually on a Saturday or Sunday.  Our experience has always been fantastic as evidenced by the fact that we stay for 3-4 hours each time. We usually sit at the bar. Service is great and very friendly.  Kenna, Joel, Ishmael, Gus and Brian are fantastic. Food is also very good, especially the beef with jalapeño sauce in the rice bowl, the burrito and the Sunday jalapeño sandwich. Tamales are also the best in the area. Ask the wait staff for a selection. They've never steered us wrong. They also have gluten free beer most of the time."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service. Had the green chili steak enchiladas and they were great. Decently priced, especially with the yelp deal! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Sadly, in town visiting and my wife wanted fish tacos.  Found this place but it was a disaster.  Empty at noon (should have known).  Waiter too six minutes to get to us.  I ordered the special - tamales.  MY fav.  But from Texas and have always had authentic tamales made by people who know w how to make them.   These were mass produced with 5x the amount of masa you should have used.  Tasted like they were made with Jiffy cornbread mix.  Awful!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the patio seating for dinner. Great drinks, great food, although more like Tex-mex. Our server was very friendly and attentive. She actually recommended for us to get less food because of portion sizes. Very responsibly priced."}
{"text":"After I got over the first impression, I loved it. It looks like more of a sports bar and the salsa left a lot to be desired, but when the food came I was impressed. The chili relleno was the best I've ever had, and the fish tacos were interesting in a good way. The \"chili\" rating on the menu is accurate - they are spicier than expected."}
{"text":"I've gone in there to eat multiple times but on a few occasions a waitress named Elise McKee serve me. The service was great and her welcoming attitude has made that place a regular eating establishment for me"}
{"text":"This is a great place for satisfying your Mexican food cravings.  Chips and salsa were great!  Love the house special chimi was awesome!  It is enough for 2. The slow roasted pork and variety of sauced made it fun to eat! The 3 Amigos platter was great as we sampled a taco enchilada and tamale. Best part of all; the manager allowed our entertainment discount without a coupon!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"It's not bad. Food average, service quite average. Waiter was harried & not keen on answering questions about the menu. Very brusk. So much so, I did not get a margarita like I usually do, since the waiter did not seem to have time to talk. Location & ambiance are fine."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place today I had the pork street tacos. Delish! He had the  pork enchiladas fresh tasting. Love love the salsa smoky flavor. Definitely will recommend this place. Good place to watch football too!"}
{"text":"This walk in and seat yourself for lunch (on Saturday anyway) restaurant was awesome!!! WARNING: LSU fans beware!!! The owner is an Alabama alum. There is Alabama paraphernalia everywhere (but in a tasteful manner I must add). 

The bartender that served me was named Kenna and she was very sweet and attentive    I ordered a house margarita (mango, frozen) and the Mexican pizza. The \"starter\" (free) chips and salsa were phenomenal!! The margarita was a perfect mixture of alcohol, mango flavoring and margarita mix. It wasn't strong to the point that you couldn't drink it but you can still taste that I had a little \"umph\" to it. The pizza (now the ONLY thing I order) was amazing. It had all the right spices (even a little spicy for this spicy food loving girl) and had the perfect amount of ingredients (carne, shredded cheese, jalepaño spread, salsa). I asked for no avocado and no sour cream, add cilantro (which they put a big serving of all over the pizza which I love because I LOVE cilantro).  

I would definitely recommend this place to others and would suggest that you sit on the balcony. Great happy hour/daily specials to benefit from. Nice decor (minus the Alabama flags) but still family friendly and good prices. I am definitely coming back (wearing my LSU Tiger gear of course!!)."}
{"text":"Highly recommended. Good food, good service, excellent menu. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Great service and wonderful food make this a go-to place for date night for us. 
We sat outside where Ishmael provided perfect service. The place was packed on Saturday night and we still received great service and hot food in a timely manner. 
We started out with cocktails. My wife had a skinny Margarita and I had a Hendricks Martini. Both were expertly prepared and quick to be served. 
I had the chili rellanos which were stuffed with pulled pork and cheese. They were the best I've had. It came with perfectly grilled zucchini and blistered red peppers.
My wife had the pork burrito served wit refried beans and cilantro rice. 
We ended up sampling each other's plates. Wonderful."}
{"text":"We go for taco Tuesday and the service is always friendly and fast... If we sit at the bar. Restaurant side is slow, so be prepared for a wait if you pick that side - but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"This place is just pretty average.  I don't have a problem coming back for dinner  but can't seem myself seeking it out.  The food was fine, the service was good, and the price was fair.  They did have a pretty awesome drink the \"Mexican Mule\" was very good"}
{"text":"What a wonderful find, fish tacos and beef tacos a wonderful! Thank you to the wonderful staff, Christina was so friendly."}
{"text":"Has to be one of the best local chill spots in Phoenix. Their coronitas and food are absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars simply because it's an Alabama bar in Scottsdale. ROLL TIDE. 


..... Thier bean dip and queso are on point as well."}
{"text":"Finally thought we'd try this place, but after about 5 minutes or so it was time to leave. After walking up to the bar, there being no one at the entryway, where the bartender kept himself busy cleaning some glassware and chatting with the attractive blonde at the bar, we glanced at the drink menu waiting for a \"hello\" or some acknowledgement. Still nothing. Gave it another minute or so, then the bartender simply walked away...  Oh well. No loss, I suppose, but based on this experience I definitely won't be back. Can't comment on the food or drinks, obviously. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Fantastic! After Carlos O'Brien's laughed at us when we arrived at their establishment asking how the wait was, we went to Blue Agave instead across the parking lot. No wait, great food and great service. We took our baby and they had cheese crisps for kids and also a little fruit cup for her and juice. The waitress was incredible and very accomodating. Wow. All I can say is wow. And being that it was Cinco de Mayo, and that every other restaurant out there was probably busy, these guys were too, but they knocked it out of the park. I highly recommend them!!!! What a great find!"}
{"text":"The food is the only reason I'm giving this 3 stars as opposed to 2. The service was bad and the menu is ok at best
I had the carne asada steak plate."}
{"text":"I went in during happy hour and no one was there. Service was terrible. Sat there for 13 minutes before getting the drink I ordered.  Food was super lackluster and service was absolutely awful never going back"}
{"text":"You can travel the world & nothing comes close to the Blue Agave.  Food is hot enough to melt your Popsicle and super yummy :)  
Oh oh oh oh oh..."}
{"text":"Really good salad! Good fresh chicken, chips n salsa are basic, and price is moderate."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy this place.  I have had the fajitas (steak and chicken), the carne asada pizza and the house enchiladas (pork and chicken) which were all very good.  I have to say that their rice is off the carts good.  This restaurant is one of my new favs for sure."}
{"text":"I hear it's much better here if you have a few drinks...maybe to keep your mind off the rude bartender (whom actually snapped at me when picking up a to-go order)....I'm giving my money to Compound Grill now instead!"}
{"text":"Food just tasted generic. My beans tasted like my grocery store canned beans. Prices were a bit too high on drinks too. 2 stars is too poor of score, 4 is much too high. 2.5 is what I would give it, so I rounded up to 3."}
{"text":"We ordered a pitcher of Organic Margarita. It  was awesome, a bit pricey, could have had more tiki tiki in it,  but worth it. Chips and salsa were above average. Chilie relano was good."}
{"text":"I would say the food was average and the service was the same. We took a chance with yelp deal. Salsa is really good. Spinach and cheese enchiladas good. Nothing really great.  My wife wanted to try a dish with the Oaxaca sauce so we asked our server what was actually made of. Never really got a full answer. The black bean and corn enchiladas my wife had were less than good. I took a bite and it tasted like canned beans and corn. ?? Their prices are good compared to other Scottsdale restaurants,  but I would rather pay a few bucks more a plate and get really really good food.  They have like 30 entrees on the menu if you are into that, but haven't they seen the show \"Restaurant impossible\". Try having half the menu items but make them incredible and people will come for the food and not the Alabama games."}
{"text":"This was absolutely the WORST burrito I've ever had EVER!!  I ordered the ground beef burrito for takeout and it was the old \"where's the beef\" problem.  Hardly any ground beef and mostly refried beans or something with massive amounts of the tortilla.  It was gross!!  I only had a couple of bites because it tasted that bad and the small amount I did eat upset my stomach and I know that was the problem because that's all I had to eat that day.  I should have listened to the server because she tried to talk me into the steak burrito but, no, I didn't listen.  Also, the look on her face when I chose the ground beef should have been a hint as well.  Hello!  I will say the rice was okay.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Mexican food in Arizona, it can be a bit scarry for me since I love California mexican food...yes theres a difference.  I ordered the relleno and enchilada, the relleno was spicy and stuffed with tomatoes, cheese, pork and some kind of spicy sauce...it was spicy yes but very good.  The enchilada was stuffed with chicken and also very good.  I had a margarita that was made very well and on top of all that the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed going to Blue Agave! The Tres Amigos was delicious! Our favorite dish was the $3 nachos off the happy hour menu! It was not only a generous portion but great amount of beef and cheese with guacamole. We also enjoyed the margaritas. Excellent service! The location is of course great because after dinner you can walk over to the movie theater. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I can only review on the happy hour specials as we didn't order from the regular menu. As far as happy hour goes, Blue Agave has some great specials. We ordered the chicken chimis and the chicken taquitos. Both were very good and the service was top notch. Our chips and drinks were never less than half full.

My great experience from happy hour makes me want to come back and try some food from their dinner menu. Stay posted for a future review!"}
{"text":"Took my sister here today for wraps and they have the best southwestern wrap ever!! 
They also serve a lot so make sure you check this place out!!"}
{"text":"This colorful decorated spot has a fun vibe to it!  The house enchiladas were okay as their skinny margarita.  (I was fairly warned by the server that this \"skinny drink\" may be \"skinny\" on flavor as well.  )  The complimentary chips were fair but the salsa was good.  Service turned more hospitable towards the latter half of our meal."}
{"text":"I know Mexican food look at my name. Blue Agave is a great restaurant with great prices good atmosphere good for Football. The carne Asada is good the Bacon wrapped Shrimp, the Ultimate Chimi tastes very good, Tacos are great, Fish Tacos are very good. Get the point! Don't listen to the wanna be professional critics on yelp, try this place and you will like it. I will agree that the salsa isn't my favorite but my wife loves it."}
{"text":"We love supporting our local businesses but not when they strive to provide horrible customer service. 

My husband & I ordered take out on Sunday night & unfortunately they made my order wrong. I contacted Blue Agave and spoke with the same girl who took the order. The girl was highly unapologetic and seemed annoyed. A simple \"I apologize\" goes a long way. 

Luckily we live a few blocks away & my husband was able to take the food back. They gave my husband the new order, and half way home he realized they gave the wrong sides. He made a U turn & went back (third time). He asked for a manager & according to my husband the manager gave just as much of a cr*p that the waitress did. Clearly we know who these employees get their fantastic customer service from (sarcasm). The manager didn't even offer to refund the order until my husband demanded it. However, it's Wednesday and we have yet to see that refund. 

My husband & I come in here all the time. The food is great... but like I said customer service goes a long way. Clearly they don't want our business. Never coming back here."}
{"text":"Food was great and the service was fast and attentive. Funnel cake fries for dessert are delicious!"}
{"text":"Im not a fan of Mexican food but my husband is so we tried this place out after finding it in the \"nearby\" list on Yelp. I was pleasantly surprised! Great food!"}
{"text":"Sonoran Rolls and the Dip Sampler (guacamole, quest, & bean dip) were excellent in quality & ample in quantity.  We also had two bowls of homemade tortilla chips & salsa washed down with Mexican-brand cervezas!  What made this special for us was the affordability (1/2 off over Happy Hour) and the complimentary game box trivia! Perfect combination! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The Jefe is the best margarita ever. Salsa is good. Chips are lower in salt than most. Guacamole is not great but much better than average."}
{"text":"Surprisingly excellent food here! We tried it out on a Groupon and weren't expecting much since it's in a mall and the decor is sports bar-ish -- but the service, margs and food were fantastic! The salsa isn't quite as spicy as we like, but it has a nice smokey flavor and the chips are good. Margs taste fresh-made, not from a bottle. Hubbie had the spicy boneless pork ribs -- super flavorful and tender. Same with my pork quesadilla. Portions, however, are huge...so we enjoyed the leftovers for lunch the next day. Terrific value here. We'll for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Let's keep it simple. Good food, good prices, and The Agave Margarita (5 stars on the rocks thank you!) with fresh lime juice, tequila and a splash of something else I can't remember. 

Good experience, friendly service, tolerant of my 3 year old.

That sums it up."}
{"text":"Visited Blue Agave while on vacation. Alyssa took great care of us. Great service, great food. If we lived local we'd be regulars."}
{"text":"Checked out Agave this past weekend with friends that live in the area. They hadn't been there in a while so we off we went. We were seated right away and checked out the menu. Our friends remarked that it looked like the menu had been slightly revamped.  We started with the Sonoran Rolls (tortillas with grilled fish, avocado and pico de gallo) and the Fried Camarones (battered shrimp).  The shrimp was so fried, it was tough to bite into. The Sonoran Rolls were better but nothing to write home about.  They just weren't very flavorful.  
I had the spinach enchiladas which were pretty good.  I'm kind of a wimp when it comes to hot foot and the red chili sauce wasn't spicy at all. That worked for me, but might not for someone who likes a little kick.
We finished off with the fried ice cream which was just like the shrimp, much too fried and difficult to eat. Our friends noted that the quality of food had definitely changed since their last visit.  The positive is that the wait staff were prompt and attentive.  The food wasn't horrible, just really underwhelming."}
{"text":"Good chips and salsa.  I had the fish tacos and did not like them.  They were served rolled up in a flour tortilla.  Pretty tasteless.  I lived in Mexico for four years and would not describe this food as Sonoran."}
{"text":"Blue Agave is my new favorite mexican restaurant!  Salsa was great, and the food is awesome! We had the chili relleno and sonoran rolls (fish taco wraps) with crema sauce."}
{"text":"We had to wait for a table but it was worth it the food was excellent 
I had wings and fish tacos both were good
My wife had the fajitas she enjoyed it"}
{"text":"The steak fajitas were amazing! I really liked the chips and salsa too. The prices I found online were different than in the store and I was on hold for a while when I called. But I'd definitely come back here."}
{"text":"On arrival (monday 5:30pm) the place was about 80% empty. We were greeted at our table with a large bowl of tortilla chips and a small bowl of decent salsa. The chips were probably warmed but from last night - more than a hint of staleness. We waited about 15 min from order to delivery of our meal.

I had the chicken fajitas and lemonade. There was a huge portion of rice and a decent portion of grilled chicken strips, with lettuce, cheese, diced tomatoes, and sour cream on a side plate along with a rolled tortilla. Everything was decent. The service was very good. I would give the meal several points above frozen food but not as good as many other places I have had chicken fajitas at. For this meal I would give the food a 3-star and the service a 4-star. The cost was very reasonable. For one drink, 2 refills, good service with Fajitas I escaped for around $18.  Will I go back again? Yes!  Check out the menu online before you go.

This place is in the far east end of the scottsdale 101 mall."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for the first time for happy hour. The specials were excellent. The food, drinks and service were top notch. We plan on making this a regular stop."}
{"text":"We went for lunch yesterday anf the quality of the food was decent but the service was lacking big time. We were one of only a couple of tables in there and our server was very slow to refill our drinks and check on us. I had purchased a restaurant.com certificate and the server said that they don't accept them and to try and get my money back. First of all, why wouldn't they have restaurant.com pull them from available vendors if they are no longer accepting their certificates and secondly they should honor the certificates already purchased and then work it out with Restaurant.com   This is the second time we've been in and received bad service and it will our last."}
{"text":"Great food with a little kick. We usually get the Tres Enchiladas with pork. Plenty of food to take home for another meal a day later. Chips and salsa are very good and brought to the table soon after being seated.

Wait staff is attentive and drink refills come quickly."}
{"text":"Kristen the bartender was on point! Great service and she was very welcoming and helpful. The Fish tacos were delicious! Hopefully the owners look at this and reward their employees for their service! Thank you again looking forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"This is my GOTO MexFix! 
 It will be yours as well 

I am so very happy my boss decided to hold our monthly birthday party for the staff here.  The sat a party of 11 got our drinks (Not a martini lunch) quickly, made some excellent recommendations and served up some of the Yummiest Mexican I have had in a long time.

My friend ordered this amazing burrito and couldn't finish it, yeah I had lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Place is nice not to fancy and the music is loud. The salsa tastes like it came out of a can and so do most of the food they make. But the price is good if you go to living social and download the 1/2 off coupon. I had the fajitas and they were ok. My wife had the fish and she liked it but it tasted frozen."}
{"text":"We did the happy hour thing. Had the lettuce wrap and some fish wrap.  Meh. Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Sorry to say - it's awful!  Not fresh, it's frozen and reheated food. Left with a nauseous feeling from rubbery chicken. Too many great Mexi places to spend $60 on AWFUL food. No go!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a quieter atmosphere seated outside with my family. The waitress was friendly, patient and accommodating. Food was fair and the drinks were reasonably priced. The Chimini birthday desert made our night. Thanks"}
{"text":"Stopped in here because we were in the mood for Mexican. Read good reviews on Yelp. Have to say the food was pretty darn good. Not your typical cheap Mexican food. The food felt a little more
Authentic. Tons of flavor. Good drinks. And good prices. Had no problems with this place."}
{"text":"Awesome. I'm a Mexican food junkie, could eat it every meal. I prefer the traditional Mexican food places as opposed to the \"street taco\" type places. Went here last night to get fajitas and it was great. The salsa was some of the best I've ever had and so were the beans. Fajitas were amazing. Service was great."}
{"text":"Using a Yelp coupon was good! Service good by Joel and provided hotter salsa on request and only ran out of chips once. Joel told wife the steak sandwich with  jalapenos was not \"too\" hot -she ordered and felt it was hot. My kettle Carne was TOO MILD AND NOT VERY FLAVORFUL although the meat and sauce was good but not a lot of taste. No problem with the Yelp coupon and bill delivered quickly as was a to go container -- to take the other half of the steak jalapeno sandwich."}
{"text":"Great food and prices are good. Service was wonderful - thank you Elyse for making it great!  Very attentive and her recommendations were spot on!"}
{"text":"Blue Agave is perfect for what it is.  It's a BAR folks....that just so happens to have an area with tables.  If I wanted to go eat good Mexican food, this would be low on my list.

I happen to almost live across the street from it, and it serves its purpose as a great neighborhood bar to chill with friends at and have a few beers.  As a restaurant....not so much.  Food is just typical cantina type food, so don't expect much there...nothing to rave about, and nothing to complain about.  There are a few yummy things on the menu (the mexican pizza appetizer is pretty good) but I mainly just go to drink.  Their free chips and salsa and a cold 20oz Dos Equis are all I need!

They have lots of late night specials each day of the week, in addition to their normal happy hour (which includes half priced appy's and cheap 20oz beers).  After 11 they have their late night menu, which is dirt cheap and has a few good things to eat on there (even if they weren't good, you can't really complain because of how cheap they are!)

The whole atmosphere is very laid back and friendly, nothing's better than just having a few beers with a friend out on the patio late at night, shootin' the shit about life."}
{"text":"This place is probably one of the better mexican restaurants we have been to. In terms of food. The best thing I've had here is the steak burrito with the jalapeno cream sauce, they have a chipotle cream sauce thats pretty good too, but what I do is half and half on the burrito! We have also gotten the vegetarian enchiladas as well as the chicken, even though its not on the menu, they still are cool and let you customize the enchiladas, fillings/sauces. The prices are pretty good, especially if you use the Yelp Deal!! The dishes are about $10-15 per dish. Depending on what you get. The reason this place is pretty good is because they have things that are atypical of other mexican restaurants. They have unique menu items in some aspects. 

We also have hit this place up for happy hour as well (we were in the area with some friends and SUPER hungry). We planned on eating dinner there, but the happy hour menu looked good so we just decided on that. The drinks are well priced about $3-5 for draft beer and margaritas. ALSO the food is pretty well priced too. We ordered the Guacamole ($2), the bean dip ($2) and the Sonoran fish rolls. DONT GET THOSE. They were so salty and gross, the sauce that it came with looked brown and muddy, and we ended up asking for the jalapeno cream sauce (which makes EVERYTHING better). The fish was also super salty, I think they said they use a halibut. Other than that, we were full, and semi pleased. It may just be worth it to use a yelp deal and order off the main menu (which is way better), if you are looking to save. Even if you don't have a deal the food is not priced terribly high. 

They have flat screen TVs in the bar and outside patio if you want to watch the game so if its not too hot, I recommend hanging out and watching the game with friends.  Its located in a strip mall so a little hard to find, just keep looking its in the back, I think near a bed bath and beyond or something. Its on the opposite side of the street as the whole foods and the container store. 

ENJOY!"}
{"text":"After a long day we wanted something good and we found it. Great relaxed atmosphere, full bar service (the Margaritas looked fantastic). The menu had great choices and our server was extremely helpful with recommendations from appetizers to full meals, steak, fish & even vegetarian dishes. The chips were fresh and the salsa was a great puree with a smoke chipotle spice. Very good. I highly recommend the chicken lettuce wraps, even though this is a Mexican food place, they were AMAZING! The guacamole is made on site and excellent as is the queso. We ended up with appetizers which were perfect for the 3 of us to share 3 different plates. Next time thought I may have to try the black bean & corn enchiladas or one of the chimi's or the fish tacos...yeah I will be back because there is a lot to try."}
{"text":"Service was five stars for sure. Restaurant was clean and in order. Food was two stars though.

Menu looks epic but lack luster execution.  I had a pork chimi with green sauce and then smothered in jalapeño cream sauce.  I ended up with soggy mess with zero pop. It had some spicy notes but essentially it was flavorless.

I could go on and on about frozen chicken tender kids meal (even though they have ingredients to do it fresh since they make other chicken dishes and breading for chili rellenos)..... And the other short comings of our dinner..... But it's just not worth the effort.

Go to Las Glorias, it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"We went for Taco Tuesday.  Thank goodness for the $20 for $10 Yelp Deal.  The soft tacos were not good at all.  The hard tacos were OK.  This was my second visit and each time I want to like it but leave feeling like I wish I'd gone someplace else."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend off of a Groupon.  The food was amazing.  The service was amazing.  Our drinks and chips were constantly full.  The food was incredible.  The outdoor seating is the place to be.  Would definitely go back.

Thanks!"}
{"text":"Came here with a LivingSocial and loved the atmosphere! Drinks are good & priced well. Being a vegetarian, I was happy with the selection on the menu & the salsa is addicting! We came into contact with 4 staff members, all of which weren't very pleasant at all, unfortunately. It took a really long time for our food to come, & mine was wrong (although, I understand as I have worked in restaurants before). We weren't overly impressed with the food at all, it was rather mediocre. Hard to say if we will be back, if I do go again it will probably just be for happy hour drinks."}
{"text":"We like to get take out on Fridays from here my husband loves the ground beef taco salads! their nacho plate was really good and way more than I could possibly eat!"}
{"text":"great place for lunch and to watch the Alabama games. fast service and friendly staff make this a great spot for cocktails as well."}
{"text":"This place is really cool.  Very laid back atmosphere, and a really nice late night menu.  I've decided I'm going to make this place my new neighborhood bar hangout."}
{"text":"I've been to Blue Agave about three times in this year alone. I really enjoy all of their food.  I've ordered everything from steak salad to the burritos and fajitas.  Do yourself a favor and try out this restaurant, it's very yummy."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to grab a bite to eat in town. The service is fantastic, and the food is always good. I had the steak tacos last time I was there, and they were stellar. My boyfriend had the same and was pleased as well. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"First time here yesterday, came in for lunch because of the Yelp Deal. I immediately liked the atmosphere- the patio is nice and very open to the inside. We sat outside and received quick service from our waiter, didn't wait too long for drinks, food, refills, etc. so no complaints there. We did at one point ask the hostess a question about their Happy Hour menu at which time we realized she didn't speak a lick of English. I understand trying to be authentic, but for goodness-sakes, your hostess should at least be able to answer simple questions!
Food: I had the two taco plate - pork soft tacos with black beans, and rice. The taco shells were cold, store bought flour shells. Extremely unimpressed. The lettuce inside the taco seemed to be the generic iceberg salad mix, with cabbage and all...? The only saving grace was the pork- it was seriously delicious! Beans and rice were incredibly bland. No flavor. Didn't finish them. 
My lunch date had one of the wraps to which she added chicken at no additional charge (awesome!), and fries. She also commented that her meal was bland.
Overall, underwhelmed by the food. Not sure I'll be back as there are better Mexican restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"The shrimp burrito had a gravel rock in it the size of a fingernail...BEWARE!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a work day lunch. Locally owned too."}
{"text":"Went in today with a yelp deal on my phone. They would only except printed deals. Even though i had a conformation number. Food is average at best. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Very disappointing in comparison to the consistently excellent original Blue Agave in Old Town.  Baffling how moving 10 miles north could screw it up that badly.  Worst part is we really do need a great mexican place in this location near the theater and Borders."}
{"text":"Place is the first incredible Mexican restaurant since moving out here from the bay. Everything was on point, serving, drinks and food. They even have leap frogs for kids!! Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Rachelle is so hospitable. I have been in hospitality for over 10 years and she made me feel like I was at home.    What a great location if you're at the local hotels I would recommend coming here"}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place.  It is not real Mexican food.  It is not cheap Mexican food. It is certainly not fast Mexican food.  
So - I really don't know what it *is*.

A girlfriend and I went in before a concert at the Compound in the same plaza.  A couple iced teas (we decided to skip the margaritas with the plans on filling our liquor consumption quotas at the concert), and the decision to split the nachos with shredded pork and the crab stuffed shrimp appetizers, as neither of us was super hungry.

Nothing wrong with the chips and salsa - fresh and decent flavor - but nothing special.  
The nachos were about as three star, middle of the road as a plate of nachos could possibly be.  Had they been missing any key ingredient - had something been prepared poorly or past its prime, I'd be able to suggest how to improve them - but they were just plain OK.  
The crab stuffed shrimp were fantastic - in concept.  Somewhere between the idea of them and the finished product being placed on the table, something went really wrong.  The breading used to fry them made them downright hard on the outside.  Either fork and knife or handle to gnaw off a bite was required.  The sticky sweet sauce they were tossed in didn't help at all.  The flavor was fine - but the texture just didn't work for me.

The prices weren't awful, given the ZIP code.  2 iced teas and the 2 apps - I was out for $30 + tip.  Half of that was the crab/shrimp debacle.  

Will I go back - well, if in the same shopping plaza - and with a friend in the mood for Mexican-style munchies - AND most of the other restaurants are closed - SURE!  Would I go out of my way to plan a meal here?  Most likely not.  Too much good Mexican food in this town to drive out of my way for what some gringo thinks the folks of N Scottsdale think Mexican food is supposed to taste like."}
{"text":"Excellent food!! I especially enjoyed their fish tacos. They are rolled up and served with a sweet sauce... Excellent complement. The Carne asada was prepared in the traditional way and was delicious. 
The strawberry Mojito and the jalapeño Margarita were also delicious and refreshing. 
There were 7 of us (3 picky kids, 1 teen, 3 adults) and there were no complaints.
Due to previous reviews, I specifically took note of the customer service...All the staff was accommodating and very nice. Again, nothing to complain about! :)"}
{"text":"Good food, good margaritas and excellent service. We went for Cinco de Mayo & the place was packed  as to be expected. We got a table in he bar area and received excellent service. I had the chicken enchiladas special. We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Visited 5/18/13........better late than never with a review?! 
Slower service I'm told was because she was checking on my peanut allergy concern.....since I was unemployed at the time, I was not in a rush. Well-rounded menu with items outside of the regular Mexican food restaurant menus....I had grilled chicken two ways: Baja style and Oaxaca style, black bean corn enchiladas, and plenty of yummy chips with salsa. It was a nice day on the patio, except the paper napkins and even a few sugar packets were blowing everywhere and there didn't really seem to be a location protocol for sudden unexpected winds! No problemo - magnifico tasty food, service with a smile!"}
{"text":"Location is great, as is the ambiance, but the server seemed unhappy to be there and the food was only mediocre.  I would suggest going elsewhere!"}
{"text":"The halibut fish tacos are the best fish tacos I have ever eaten anywhere.   Served with rice and beans, which were very flavorful and delicious.  I had them while on vacation and wish I could have them now!   Our server was very good, the food was delicious.  5 stars!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for lunch and they have a really great lunch menu with low prices and good food. The service is pretty good and they get you in and out fast, which helps when you are headed back to work. I like the chicken enchiladas, lunch price $6.99 and it comes with your choice of side between fries, black or pinto beans soup or a salad. Not a bad deal!"}
{"text":"My family and I ate here during our visit to Phoenix. 5 people, all with different taste preferences, were all very happy with our meals and drinks. I had the tamales with green sauce, which was good (not amazing, but good). The enchiladas were fantastic and their drinks are amazing. We had several different margaritas, one with pomegranate, the other with jalapenos. Fantastic. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone with kids or for family outings. Free parking in the area and a very laid back, relaxed environment. We can't thank the bartender enough for his amazing help and great recommendations."}
{"text":"Blue Agave is always my first choice for great Mexican food. Chips & salsa is great & the food always tastes fantastic. Favorite menu item is the steak fajitas. Best in the area. Service is always good. I would highly recommend Blue Agave."}
{"text":"Average, run of the mill Scottsdalian \"Mexican\" food.  Went there on a Friday night and the place was pretty hoppin' - the patio and inside bar were both crowded and many of the dining room tables were occupied.  The server was pleasant and fairly attentive.  Chips and salsa were brought promptly.  The chips were nothing special.  The Spinach con Queso (more like queso con spinach) was delicious.  My friend and I also split the Chipotle Chicken Salad.  It was pretty basic and the chicken was a bit tough/chewy.  My friend also ordered the Agave's Ultimate Chimi, which the server said was the most popular dish.  Apparently it was extremely spicy."}
{"text":"Good local Tex Mex place in strip mall sports bar venue. TV's everywhere with large projection unit in bar area.  Food is tasty and authentic.  Try the stuffed relleno, huge with a generous carnitas stuffing.  House margarita was way too sweet, took three limes to make it drinkable. Get the Diamond Margarita instead.  Quick and attentive service.  Will definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"Chunky tasteful quesadilla with shrimp and veggies. Fresh chips. Service decent. Blue Agave's simply needs to step up game with their salsas to be more remarkable."}
{"text":"Yes! It's so good! This time we tried kettle carne, a yummy shredded pork with hot tortillas. This is delish. We had a chicken quesadilla and saved a few pieces for lunch tomorrow, and also cheese enchiladas which were also delish. This is good food and good service. The Jefe margarita is my new favorite! Again, we will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was very good as well as the service.  We came for a late lunch/early dinner after a long day at the nearby Mayo Clinic.  Not crowded and my husband enjoyed the easily to view televisions that were tuned into a sports channel.  

We will return."}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner.  It was about 7ish and the place was pretty dead.  We were seated promptly and our drink orders were taken and we were given a big bowl of tortilla chips and some salsa.  The chips were eh' but the salsa was pretty good because it did have some heat to it.

Our waitress was fast and friendly so no complaints there.

As far as the menu is concerned, I'm not really sure what to make of it.  My guess is this place is trying to be a typical Scottsdale restaurant that tries to do a fresh take on old cuisine.  Blue Agave's goal was probably to take a bunch of typical \"Mexican\" dishes and combine them with a Californian and New Mexican flair.  Combine that with some gringo stuff in a Scottsdale joint trying to be trendy and there you have Blue Agave.

The food:

*Tortilla Soup - I loved it.  I am told that this isn't \"real\" tortilla soup but I don't care.  I love it a bit thick/creamy and not watery.  I thought it was perfect.  Plenty of chicken and plenty of spice.

*Chicken Lettuce Wraps - These are basically chicken tacos without the shell.  Definitely a healthier option which is probably why my wife ordered them as a meal.  Anyway, it was actually pretty good but a tad bit bland.

*Stuffed Relleno - How can a spicy, cheesy, meaty thing NOT be good?  This was in no way a healthy option but I love stuffed chillies so what the heck.

The food here is pretty ok for what it is.  The quality of it is eh' as is the ambiance of the place.  I would like to try more of their menu but there are tons of other Mexican/New Mexican/Baja type places in the valley that are far superior I would visit first."}
{"text":"Bad service, bad food. Can't seem to get anything right. First I couldn't get anyones attention, and im sitting at the bar. It was hard to get a drink, even harder to get a menu. My side of guacamole for the chips never came my food.order was wrong and when I explained that, they looked at me as if I am crazy!! bottom line this place sucks."}
{"text":"Great food and service, we drive from old town Scottsdale area every couple of weeks to eat here."}
{"text":"Service ok. Food not so great. Drinks ok. Happy hour prices good. Kinda dirty, not my cup of tea"}
{"text":"What a great margarita selection! Their flavors are endless and Rachelle is always so helpful and attentive. Each time I've visited she would tell us flavors she can make that are not listed on the menu. 

My friend and I made this our go-to spot every few weeks for margaritas and their amazing spinach queso dip (it's dangerously addicting). We usually sit at the bar or a high top to watch the games on the TV. Haven't tried anything else here, but definitely will next time! The great service and delicious drinks is what keeps us coming back! 

Make sure to get the check in offer, the Groupon deal, or check you mail for coupons! Love that there are lots of ways to save at this restaurant. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience at Blue Agave.  We've eaten there many times over the years and in addition to our \"go to\" dinner items Baja Platter, Fish Tacos, Oaxaca Chicken Tacos, and Ultimate Chimi we also enjoy starting things off with the queso.  In addition to that my wife is a big margarita fan and really enjoys the Organic Margarita.  I myself am a beer guy and they usually have some great revolving craft beers in house to choose from in addition to the standard Pacifico, Corona, Dos Lager and Amber, etc.  If your ever in the mood for great Mexican food I highly recommend trying."}
{"text":"Ok, so not many flavors impress me lately,  but theirs Sonoran rolls were the bomb.  They were cold and usually that is a no-no for me, but the flavor was so much in point I didn't even care. The margaritas are amazing! Will be back."}
{"text":"Great chips and salsa, service was great. Thanks Michelle. A lot of food. The jalapeño cream sauce is super yummy."}
{"text":"I dined here with my husband and two friends last night.  We sat at a high top table in the bar area.  I was pleasantly surprised by how good the free chips and salsa were.  The chips were thin and crunchy just the way I like them.  We had the fish tacos, chicken tacos and the mini chimis.  We all thought our dinners were delicious.  I had the grilled fish taco and they said it was halibut. It had large chunks of fish as well as avocado.  It came with an awesome sauce to pour over it.  The rice that came with it was equally as delicious.  The black beans that I received with it were a little bland.  

The decor was classy and they had a pretty good happy hour, too.  Service was spot on!   I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. It wasn't that it was bad, it just wasn't anything notable. We're blessed to have a lot of really good Mexican fare available to us in the area, but this doesn't make that distinction (in my humble opinion.) We decided to stop in after going to the movies and when I checked in on Yelp, there was a special deal $10 for $20 worth of food - why not? We ordered traditional margaritas (a bit too sweet). For entrees: Jefe Pollo and two tacos (pork & chicken). The cole slaw that came with the chicken was good, and the piece of chicken was large, but unfortunately, overcooked. The black bean salsa was flavorful, too. The tacos were so-so. Not bad, not good.

When we got our bill, the waitress had not included the Yelp deal so had to re-do it. 

I think this place has a bit of identity crisis. The bar area was like a sports bar which didn't seem to fit with the restaurant theme. And can someone explain the 3 aquariums on the wall dividing the bar from the restaurant? First of all, either the (plexi)glass is very scratched, or the water is dirty. Not attractive or appealing. One tank had a bunch of teeny fish, and I saw one fish in another tank, but one tank looked empty - maybe the fish were hiding. But at first glance, these look like 3 tanks with fake coral in them. I just don't get why they are there - doesn't seem to fit with the whole Mexican food - agave theme.

I'd like to give this place 2 1/2 stars but since I can't, 3 it is. I doubt we'll be back - lots of other options."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!! Our first time in today and we loved the food and service. I had chicken fajitas with refried pintos and every bite was dreamy!! My husband loved his soft chicken tacos also. The beer was cold and we arrived right in the happy hour zone. It was a 5 star restaurant (in terms of enjoyment, not a fancy 5 star) and our server, Dodie, did a great job too. It was a bit of a drive for us but we will be back for the food!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I've had. And a great environment for family and friends."}
{"text":"Went for food, not drinks.  We didn't know the prices were inflated to compensate for coupons they apparently regularly offer, so it seemed a bit steep.  Food was fine.  Service was thoughtless. Also, they may want to check their plumbing or get some sort of filter. Their tap water had a horrible smell and taste."}
{"text":"I've eaten here once and drank here once. The food is decent and servers are friendly. The bonus about this place is that it's the only bar open in the area until 2am on a week night -too bad the kitchen closes at 10. Considering I can walk here from home, I'm sure I'll be by again!"}
{"text":"Blue Agave's fish tacos are like wow. Best place (next to Central Phoenix's Barrio Cantina) to go for fish tacos. But apart from that, their menu is good, not incredible. 

I second what someone else said - that it's kind of \"Scottsdalian Mexican food.\"  It's definitely not authentic, kind of modded up for the trendiness of North Scottsdale, and I think the prices reflect that as well.  I wouldn't say it's grossly overpriced, but I'd say it's right at the point where if they charged any more it'd be a rip off. 

As it is the place is always clean with fresh salsa and tasty food, plenty of beer and margaritas to go around. I recommend it highly as it's not a chain - and for that alone I like it - and for a comfortable and clean atmosphere for a good night out.  I've also been told that it turns into more of a club on weekends, sad to say I've never been there to see that - but I'm sure it's pretty good spot (well, as good as they come in North Scottsdale).  

Now, having finished my review, I'm thinking back - I like Blue Agave, but I LOVE Pinatas. You should go there instead."}
{"text":"Awesome...best Mexican food we have had in a long time.  Friendly atmosphere but not pushy.  Price is average."}
{"text":"This is one of my local favorites for work lunch.  The noise level is pretty low so conversations are easy.  I really like the Jalepeno Cream soup and my new favorite is the fish tacos. I recommend both dishes if you are trying to figure out something."}
{"text":"Blue Agave has tasty food, good drinks, and best of all, it's a great place to watch Alabama football in the Fall.  RTR!  Try the Kettle Carne; it's the perfect starter."}
{"text":"When we eat at a new restaurant, we tend to familiarize ourselves with their menu well before we go. We are avid fans of Mexican food. But, we found ourselves disappointed. 
First off, the charm of the waiter was less than ideal. He seemed off by our surprise that their menu online, had items they no longer carried. 
The kids menu has little to be desired by my 10 year old son, so we ended up getting him an adult meal that carried some meat in it. 
The prices are high for the quality of food. I ordered the original chimi, and found it to be bland. The jalapeño cream sauce was actually really gross. 
My husband enjoyed his enchiladas for the most part, but there was definitely no \"wow\" factor to any of the food. 
The only thumbs up I give it was the spinach queso was actually pretty good. But, beware of having to pay for each extra bowl of salsa after the first."}
{"text":"Went here with my husband before going to the movies. Was very disappointed in the food. I am huge on Mexican food and this place is not real Mexican food in my opinion.The meat was probably the lowest grade of meat, both chicken and steak. It tasted terrible, you could tell the chicken was processed and the steak was really fatty. The salsa looked like marinara sauce and was nothing special. The food period was just not very good. I would never eat here again. The atmosphere was nice though."}
{"text":"There is really nothing special about Blue Agave. Its an average Mexican restaurant and the only thing that brings me back is trivia on Wednesdays. If you get first place they give you a $20 bar tab."}
{"text":"We went yesterday at 4:30. Terrible service, one waiter only. Never saw him for drink refills, never came to the table after someone else brought our food to the table. We needed him since I never got my corn tortillas for my fajitas. Finally as we sat there for our check he stopped by, 10 more minutes before he returned with the check.
We do not recommend this location.  Not impressed"}
{"text":"I HATE to give such a bad review, but... WOW, you've gotta just hope a place like this closes so they don't impose themselves on someone else.  When dinner conversation is about how bad the food is, and which version of a television enteepeneural rescue might be able to fix this place... when the service is so poor that the conversation can go on & on without interruption for ANYONE asking if we needed water, salsa, does anyone want to take our order, would we like the check? 
 NOTHING... well... there's gonna be a bad review!

Perhaps good food could have saved the bad service... but... food tasted stale, no spice, nothing fresh (including the salsa). I noted a flavor of partially fermented dough in the tortilla in my cheese & onion enchiladas, and practically no onions to be found among them. The red sauce was so sweet as to make the meal feel almost like it might want to be a dessert, and the cheese seemed to be a cheap cheddar wanna-be. My husband commented that his chili relleno had almost no flavor. It was supposed to have chorizo in it but he couldn't find any, there did appear to be a flavorless, canned, water-packed TUNA, however... we thought perhaps it was just poorly pulled chicken... hard to tell, as there was, similarly no flavor to it.

To be sure, that wasn't the worst of it. The service... what can I say ... the door people were not present when we arrived at 4:50 pm (what you'd think was the time they were gearing for their rush on a Thursday evening of a holiday weekend)... THere was ONE party seated for dinner, no one else, no one waiting.  JUST us in a nearly empty restaurant, so poor service is not excused by overtaxed staff. An hour later, as we left, it turned out that there were two people assigned to the door. They were standing near it talking to each other as we walked out. One of them said \"goodbye\", which made us wonder how or why, if TWO people were assigned to the task of bringing people in, that no one could be assigned to bring water...

After we'd been seated, with no staff in sight, for 10 minutes... my husband excused himself to go to the bathroom. As he walked past the staff congregated near the hall, FINALLY someone noticed that we were there, and she came over to ask if we wanted drinks. All we wanted was water, she brought us some & left, saying someone would be by \"soon\" to take our order. Well... \"soon\" is a relative issue here... I suppose another 5 minute wait qualifies. The person who arrived NEXT made it clear he was NOT our waiter, but he did come and ask who our waiter was... when we said we had no clue, no one had claimed us yet but we knew what we wanted to order, so we asked if he could he take the order, so he did. When the food came out 10 minutes later, it was ... well... we'd have been happier with Taco Bell, I'm afraid.

A half hour later, after we'd eaten half our meals, twirled around our forks, pushed food around a lot, talked about the defects of the meal and service until we were so sick of the place that we were CERTAIN to write bad reviews, our waiter came to take the order of a family who had been seated behind me... the man didn't cast an EYE in our direction, as my husband was waiving for someone to please notice so we could get the check. We had discussed whether we should go to the bar or start walking out and then maybe they'd notice us so we could get our check and pay so we could leave... but when the waiter came to the table behind me, it appeared we might have some luck and get some service... NOPE... As the waiter walked away, my husband had to YELL across the restaurant to get his attention \"EXCUSE ME... could we get our check please\"... so the waiter turned and asked, \"what\", and my husband again yelled his request... we finally got the check, paid (without a tip... another thing tha tbothered us. We ALWAYS tip... usually leave between 25-30% as a memorium to someone we know who worked his way through college as a waiter ... not something we usually talk about, but just something we do... and to choose NOT to tip was kind of upsetting, but to tip THIS service would have been obscene)... We FINALLY got out of there...

If this place doesn't go under soon, it'll be a miracle. One of the topics of our dinner conversation was which would be the better rescue... Bar Rescue (Jon Taffer), whose rescues seem to fail soon after he visits... Ramsays Kitchen Disasters (he can be crude, but at least you get the FEELING that the food might be better after he leaves)... or perhaps The Profit (Marcus Lemonis), who usually offers to partner with the business if they take his advice... a formula more likely to make them actually turn around because he won't LET them fail if he is invested in them. We figured The Profit might be able to help this place out... but seriously, if the service and food remain as they were when WE were there this evening... the only purpose for going there is to see how NOT to do it!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat in Arizona. Fajitas are amazing and the service here is great."}
{"text":"Twenty-ounce Dos Equis Ambers for $3.25 during happy hour.
Chips are served warm. The guacamole is a delight.

If you're an enchilada sauce aficionado, they've got a red sauce that's out of this world. I had a dish called....well, fuck me runnin...I forget now.
Anyway, its a braised pork dish topped with enchilada sauce, red or green. 

Lots of tv sets to watch sporting events. 
Booths are comfy and the server was extremely pleasant, as if she actually enjoyed her job. Now there's a novel concept.
The hostess was dizzy but nice. 

Overall, this is a pretty decent experience when White Chocolate Grill is up to its gunwales in Scottsdale douche-nozzles waiting (60-90 minutes)  for a table.

Last time I ate at Blue Agave my banker brought me here to end our relationship.
That was 2009. 
Four years and one great recession later, BAMC is still in business. Kudos to BAMC for surviving the great recession. 

As it relates to my former banker, I hope she's now homeless and no longer has access to feminine hygiene products, or even soap and water for that matter. 
And, vinegar too.

A fitting salute for that stinky lending-whore."}
{"text":"Not a ad place to go. Tvs everywhere for sports. Fish tank for the kids. Gluten free menu wasn't bad. Place gets busy around 6pm. I would come back the service was very good. I did get sick from the food"}
{"text":"Service was great. Queso was really good. The fajitas were good as well. First time here and we will be back."}
{"text":"Decor is pretty nice (there's even fishtanks and cozy booths), service is pretty quick, food is a flop.  And its expensive!  I don't want to pay $15 bucks for a mediocre taco, do you?  You're better off going to Wendy's and ordering the southwest salad..."}
{"text":"Great Food  such FRIENDLY service. Ambience is fun and happy. They've got a huge TV to watch the game too. Gotta try the Saguaro Blossom ! Awesome"}
{"text":"Since North Scottsdale is light on passable Mexican this becomes the de facto spot to scratch the occasional taco itch. Solid menu and a decent sports bar environment should you want to catch a game. Recent price increases to the menu have taken the luster off of what was once a solid member of my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time on Monday night.  DELICIOUS!  I had the Tres Enchiladas and one of their margaritas.  The server was very sweet and the food came out in a timely manner.  

The only downfall is that on the Kids Eat Free app, this place is listed as a Monday night choice.  They do NOT offer kids eat free.  The server was apologetic and explained that they are taking that off their website.  

They had a great happy hour and I can't wait to go back.  There were about five other dishes I wanted to try.."}
{"text":"On Spring break vacation, we found this restaurant located in the fine dining section of the entertainment book we purchased for our trip out there. The coupon was great with the punch card used for the fine dining section of the coupon book, and the sample menu sounded delish. Absolutely love Mexican, we have a place at home we go often, and wanted to find another non-chain - great Mexican restaurant. We happened to go during a weekday for an earlier dinner which placed us there during their happy hour. The selections for the appetizers that were included in the happy hour prices were amazing. Our waiter who was very friendly and helpful pointed out the nachos which were loaded with everything tasty, were an amazingly huge portion, especially for the happy hour price... and he wasn't kidding, it was way more that we could eat for 2 people. All the food was great, and well priced, Very clean and neat decor - and too boot, at the bar we were able to catch the end of a basketball game to see our home team - Cleveland Cavs beat the Heat! NICE!"}
{"text":"Amazing steak fajitas, great salsa, and the BEST service (we ate at the bar). We watched football, and met friendly people, while enjoying a yummy dinner with enough food to share one entree and an appetizer;)"}
{"text":"Rolled in here with the family not realizing that we were walking into an Alabama football watching party. (Roll damn Tide, Pawwwl...)

It was loud and not really conducive to conversation. In retrospect it may have been a blessing, because my mother was driving me crazy trying to find the place. But I digress.

I picked the Carne Asada. Even after giving it a little hit of lime juice from the wedges provided, there wasn't a lot of flavor going on with this plate. Margaritas were solid.

I'd come back here for the margaritas. I probably would have enjoyed it better if I came in when they weren't trying to be a sports bar."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in town.  The food is always delicious, and I've been there for lunch and dinner and Happy Hour. They have good Happy Hour specials, and the servers are always attentive."}
{"text":"We go to Blue Agave ALL the time. Food is great. Let me tell you, if you check in with Yelp! there is always a coupon available or you can go to Living Social or Double Take and buy a offer from them. We never not have some kind of deal when we go. 
Chips are thin, i love thin chips and the salsa is like a chipotle salsa, love that too.
They offer a great gluten free menu. I am hooked on their Carne Asada Rice Bowl. I also love their spicy boneless pork ribs, there is so much meat and the flavor is out of this world, comes with rice and your choice of black beans, pinto beans or refried beans, flour or corn tortillas, i choose corn because of the gf thing. I'm told by my Alex that Ultimate chimichanga are delicious. 
There is a full service bar and a huge list of tequilas to choose from.
Get on their email list and they will send you offers there too and updates on up coming events, like Blood Mary specials, yum, they have good ones :)
We recommend giving Blue Agave a shot."}
{"text":"Eh...nothing special here. If you are craving REAL mexican food with real cheese stay away  from Agave. I came here because of the yelp deal but it never looked that great to me driving through the shopping center. Im not a cook but I can easily whip up the menu and it would taste just the same. I guess i call this bar food or the ...?? No, Kraft Mac n Cheese of Mexican."}
{"text":"I love both the food and staff here. The Jalapeno Cream soup FN rocks! The margaritas are Awesome! I dig on the Bulldog. It comes with a Coronita, so it is two drinks in one. Good for exposing the out of towner to the Southwest.

My acquaintance Brian owns the joint. He rocks and so does his staff. The bar skirts inside and outside. You get the best of both worlds. I highly recommend a pit stop here. The Penske Racing museum is around the corner. It is free and awesome too. #vino2ultimate #vinosquared"}
{"text":"I loved the steak fajitas. It was well seasoned, cooked perfectly and sooo tasty. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"First time here. Stopped in for lunch. Was somewhat busy. Josh was our server. He was very quick and nice! I ordered the cheese and onion enchiladas and my husband ordered pork and chicken enchiladas. I have never had better enchiladas in my life! They were sooooo good. The salsa was also just as good. Not super spicy (I don't do spicy). We will definitely be back. We also downloaded the app to get a punchcard. Good deal. Great service and yummy food :)"}
{"text":"Food was a solid 4 stars.  Service was good.

We had the organic margarita, which had a good clean taste to it.  It did not taste like the cheap margaritas some places make but for $10, it better be higher quality.  lol.

The ultimate chimichanga was good but we were expecting to be crunchy from being deep fried.  It had a soft exterior.  4-stars.

The steak fajitas were good as well.  A solid 4-stars.  

We will return when we are in the area and need a Mexican treat.  It does hit the spot."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!  We drive from Surprise and I can honestly say it is one of the best Mexican restaurants in the valley.  The nachos with the pulled pork were amazing.  A must here is the bean dip! Spicy and yummy, it does not disappoint.  Michelle was our server tonight and with as busy as it was, our glasses were never empty and she is so nice.  Best carne asada i have ever had, it was so tender and delicious.  My kids loved it.  Well worth the drive with or without the Groupon deal.  Excellent!  I would give more than 5 stars if i could!  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Had the steak enchiladas.  Hubby had fish tacos. Everything was OK, not a place I would come back to for food.  I may have came back for happy hour until I saw a mouse sitting there for a sec on the floor by my feet before he ran away to near the bar area.  The mouse was kinda cute but I seriously don't wanna see one running around a dining establishment.  2 stars because the server was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in one Sat night for dinner as we have ordered from Blue Agave before but thru a meal delivery (and it was very good). I decided on the veggies fajitas and my boyfriend had a chicken rice bowl and we loved both dishes. The margaritas were very tasty as well. We sat at a high top in the bar area and while it was crowded service was very good. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Had the taco salad , 

Was ok, the steak was cooked like a fajita. 
It was not really big but was filling. 

It was good but not a dinner but is good for a lunch. 

The atmosphere was more like a restraunt and Mexican bar."}
{"text":"Sunday evening 3-19-18. Party of 7. Must have been understaffed because the tables were not cleared and the servers were running. After 2 large trays of chips and several bowls of delicious chipotle salsa we still had no water!! I asked the bartender for a pitcher of water and some glasses and he refused. Good food. 
Terrible service. 


Thank you for your thoughtful and generous response! We did enjoy the food. It was delicious. We will revisit the restaurant soon."}
{"text":"Food was good. Overall, 4 stars. I would return if I was in the area but wouldn't make the drive again from where I live.

Went in because my boyfriend bought the living social deal. The bartender who waited on us was nice and helpful and my margarita was delicious! 

The salsa has a hint of chipotle. Not bad but different than what you'd imagine. I had the agave enchiladas and I really liked them. The pork was excellent and so were the sauces on top. My boyfriend had the impressive chimichanga. It was absolutely huge - definitely enough for two. We both left with to go boxes. And my left overs were great for lunch today :)

The queso was alright- spinach queso isn't my favorite kind of queso but my boyfriend seemed to like it. 
 
It wasn't very busy either which was disappointing to see. I would guess its location that's hurting them but if you are the area, it's definitely worth a stop by. I will visit again if I am ever in that area :)"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food.  I had the ultimate chimicunga, which I've come to know as a deep fried burrito but here it wasn't fried.  It was however one of the best I've ever had, my wife had the fish tacos and said they were wonderful.  We'll go back next time we're in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Visited here yesterday (7/13/15) and was very unhappy. I got a steak fajita and have been suffering from food poisoning ever since. Never eating here again, absolutely repulsed."}
{"text":"I am giving Blue Agave a 3 star because of the service.  From the hostess who greeted us, our server, to the manager who stopped by our table----friendly, personable, efficient.

Not so much for the food.   Let's start with the chips and salsa.  The chips tasted like those kind that come in a big cardboard box shipped in from Chicago, and we got the bottom of the box and they were stale.  The bowl of salsa we got had no bite and had a weird bitter flavor.  DH asked our nice server for something with some more \"bang\" and he returned with a bowl he said was chipotle.  It was a little spicer, but it had a weird \"dirt\" flavor.  Okay, skip the chips and salsa.  But that was really the worse of it.

DH ordered the Ultimate Chimichanga.  I ordered the Stuffed Rellenoes.  Our meals  came out fast, came out hot, and were of generous proportion---which is good, because at 15.99 and 12.99, they weren't cheap, really.  We definitely both brought home half our meals.  And yep, we brought home the leftovers because there was nothing wrong with the meals---they just weren't memorable enough that we'd ever come special to the Blue Agave (we were at BB&B at dinner time).  The pulled pork that was in both my and DH's entrees was bland, though pretty tender.  The whole meal was kind of bland.  Forgettable,  Although I did like that my meal came with a side of sauteed vegetables rather than the inevitable beans and rice.

But it was hot and filling and acceptable and we liked the staff.

BTW---maybe we weren't impressed by our meals, but a lady in a booth across and up from us must have really not liked her dinner, because even three booths away, we could hear her haranguing her server about her meal.  She wasn't pleasant at all.  Hey, People---LISTEN UP!  Your server did not (99.9% of the time) cook your meal.  It;s okay to tell them you didn't enjoy your food, but to subject them to a bitter tirade...c'mon, it's a meal, not a life-altering decision.  There are ways to handle it, like ask to speak to the manager of even the chef, but to natter on at a poor server whose only crime was to carry the plate to your table.  Really?

So if we are back down there shopping, maybe we'd stop in again, but there are some other places in the area I have been wanting to try, so...  I can tell you if they brought the quality of the food to the level of service, we'd be there a couple of times a month.  Kudos to the staff!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are long time customers. We love visiting at least twice a week and 95% of the time we sit in the bar. Recently, we were in and decided to sit in the restaurant dining area. They were busy in the bar and invited the change. We noticed a substantial  change in our  service. Our beverages were ordered and it took a little while we felt as we still needed to.place our meal order. Once our order was delivered, we were not asked if we would like a refill on our beverages or anything else and we were out of salsa.

No one stopped by throughout our whole meal to see how it was, and if we needed anything.  We had never experienced this service here before. The funny thing was there was only one other table being attended to.

As we had left, I had told my husband how I felt about our experience and he agreed and stated we love tgis.pstlace and will.continue to visit but not be served by this waiter if he continues to work there.

We revisited recently and sat at the bar and I noticed the gentlemen that had been our waiter in the past was working. I truly hope he is spoken to as he stands out from the others for sure. The service there otherwise is  exceptional."}
{"text":"Went there Monday 4/20 at about 8pm with friends, place was dead empty.

Decor-wise it is much more a bar (a Bama bar) than a restaurant.

Order the tres enchilada platter ... completely ordinary and forgettable.  Oddly when I ordered it the waitress asked if I like heat; I told her I did but after eating my dinner I cant imagine why it would matter. On a scale of 1 to 10 the heat was 1 at best.

Probably won't go back any time soon."}
{"text":"You go for the food and stay for the drinks.  Potent one two punch.  Quality all the way around is better than average.  Better food, drinks, service and happy hour prices than most.  Nice ambiance too!"}
{"text":"First experience--excellent! Great food and service, atmosphere is okay. Lots of options on menu. Free chips and salsa. Used a $20 for $10 voucher."}
{"text":"This was my first dinner out in Phoenix and the quality has been consistent for years. The food is fresh and the atmosphere is clean and inviting. The bar offers excellent service and the chips and salsa are among my favorite in the Valley. I recommend the Baja Platter for anyone who likes seafood. The steak tacos are also delicious!"}
{"text":"Went with a friend and my sister for early dinner, reasonable prices for happy hour on apps and drinks!
Food was mediocre nothing special and can't really compete with more authentic mexican joints in the area.
Was a mexican restaurant posing as a sports bar is how I'd describe it.
Basically just went because we had a groupon NOW deal, wont be back again."}
{"text":"Spinach con queso always resembles baby vomit, so it better taste exceptional. I could have made this at home, with a box of Velveeta and a can of spinach. Gross. Salsa, eh so so, on the soupy side. It's never a good sign when you walk into an establishment and wait 30 seconds, wondering if you should just seat yourself. I was generous by giving two stars, my cocktail was tasty and they had my favorite candy, which I took a handful of upon my departure. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Sorry gang I generally hate writing poor reviews, but this one had it coming.

I came here after an Adventure Run.  I usually try to rush there to get early seating which I did.  Needless to say, I was one of about 2 other runners that made it.  So I thought I'm going to sit at a prime location....at the high tops on the aisle, but close enough to the bar.  As I sat and waiting; the servers didn't seem to give me any sort of nods or attention.  Not even a slight glance to acknowledge me.  

As I continued to sit and ate the chips and salsa pre-placed before the other runners came; I found myself thirsty, yet still no attention so I grabbed some water across the table from me.  As more and more people came in; guess whom got water, drinks and food first?  Not this guy, I continue to sit and wait...and the servers kept walking past me to serve other table; literally walking past me if I didn't exist!

You know that feeling when you sit at a restaurant and people that came after you get their food first;  yeah I got that feeling.  Its appalling and offensive, cause it's makes you feel mistreated and discriminated.  I literally timed myself as time past; 24 minutes later....nothing.  As a former restaurant server, host, cook, etc.  This should never happen.  I know all the tricks of the trade and one is never assume, always ask; have you ordered your drinks, are you waiting for someone, can I get you anything.....something!

In the end, I'm never attending this place again!  Thanks Blue Agave for the chips and salsa and water that I served myself.  Next time I want to be ignored or left along; I know just the place - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here with my wife for a casual, low-key dinner...

Pros:  Service was excellent, our waiter was a super nice guy and made sure we were taken care of during our dining experience.  Wish more waiters were like him....The restaurant also has a sizable bar and outdoor seating available.  Located in a shopping plaza with plenty of parking.

Cons:  Food was OK.  I ordered the chimichanga and wife got the burrito rice bowl along with spinach queso dip.  The salsa for the chip was far below average, almost like a thickened ketchup.  I wish I had more  positive things to say about the food.  

Disappointed with the food and cannot recommend as a place to go."}
{"text":"I must say I was pleasantly surprised by how good this place is.     Starting with the big bowl of chips and salsa, the salsa was flavored with the perfect list of ingredients.   I ordered the Ultimate Chimichanga and my companion, the Baja Fish Tacos.    I am not real big on fried food, but the chimichanga was not greasy at all.    I ordered it with the chicken, and it also contained beans and various cheese and seasoning.    Yummm!!    My companion had the crispy version of the fish tacos.   It came with a sauce, which was completely unnecessary.     The flavors couldn't have been better.    Would I return?   You betcha!!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food at a great price!  Love the happy hour and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Terrific happy hour- good food, great drinks- awesome specials!"}
{"text":"We never get tired of this place. Great service, really good food. Reasonable  prices.  Fun patio. We love their happy hour. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food and service are always consistently outstanding at this locally owned restaurant location.  There is not enough positive feedback that I can provide regarding this wonderful restaurant.  They always make me feel valued as a customer.  I recommend that you visit Blue Agave Mexican Cantina, where they genuinely care about exceeding each customer's expectations.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time! Me and my fiancé just moved to town and was looking for our new \"nitch\" place. And we found it! Greta staff, friendly and laid back. Cold beer. The food we had was amazing. We went simple and had tacos and street tacos. We will defiantly be back!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to treat my parents who were in town to dinner and we decided for Mexican food. We found blue agave on yelp and decided to give it a try. My family and myself are big on chips and salsa and margaritas! 
The chips were delivered warm, which is great and they were thin chips which I also like, but they had an off flavor. I'm not sure if the oil was old or what. The salsa had a chipotle flavor to it and no heat so also a bit disappointed in that. 
The server, who was very nice recommend getting their special 8$ margarita with blue agave tequila, fresh lime juice and agave nectar. So I got that, because she said there was no sweet and sour mix in it. My first drink, man it was way too sweet, like sweet and sour mix was used. I ended up asking for a bunch of limes and squeezed about 3/4 of a lime into the marg to make it enjoyable. 
I ordered an appetizer that was shredded pork, covered with red and green sauce served with tortillas, onion cilantro and a different salsa. I didn't enjoy the green sauce, and would only do red for next time. The tortillas had the same off flavor as the chips so I only had one. The meat was good and tender, the onion and cilantro really tied everything together. 
Overall it wasn't a bad dinner, but I don't think I'll ever be back. Not enjoying the chips, salsa and margaritas are why I won't be back"}
{"text":"Everyone looks for that little hole in the wall that turns out to be a gem in the rough.  This isn't it.  it's closer to rough than gem.  Food is iffy at best.  Service is borderline.  They have good hours and the chips are relatively fresh so all is not a loss."}
{"text":"I agree with a lot of reviews on here-the chips and salsa are off. The salsa taste like a chipotle ketchup and the chips have a weird bad oil flavor. I ordered the stuffed pork relleno pepper and pork tamale special. The pork in the relleno was hard to identify as meat and everything tastes bland. The tamale was just okay, very dry and I've never had one with cheese on top before. The refried beans were very bland. The rice was okay. My wife got the chicken fajitas. The meat tastes okay, but everything else was bland. The only reason I give two stars is for the friendly waitress."}
{"text":"Pretty much everything I ate at this place made me sick. The food is overly spicy to the point that I couldn't taste anything at all. It seemed very indifferently prepared, kind of slapped together and way overly seasoned. I don't I can ever go back."}
{"text":"Walked into this place on Labor Day weekend for the first time. I was greeted by Eddie and felt welcomed right away by him. Eddie sat us down and took our drink order right away. It was amazing service right off the bat. Eddie was also our server and I've been to plenty of restaurants, all I have to say is thank you so much Eddie for the amazing service. Our drinks never went empty once and Eddie would check on us very often. Very pleased with the restaurant and the food. Amazing work and service. Thank you again Eddie"}
{"text":"My husband and I really like this place for great Mexican food.  The food is always good! The only thing I would work on are the margaritas. I have had better. But other than that this place has great food! The carne asada rice bowl is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great food and a very good service to start with. Its kind of the perfect place if u want to hang out on a weekend and avoid the crowd! The $10 for $20 deal they have on yelp and the in house discounts made it real light on my wallet as well."}
{"text":"Came because of the $10 for $20 deal. Loved it. Drinks are way better than Aunt Chilada's. You can actually taste the tequila in the margaritas. Fish tacos a 10 out of ten. Owner's Chimichanga is a killer. We'll be back. Our new favorite Mex kitchen in the Valley of the Sun"}
{"text":"Our family is visiting from out of town and Blue Agave was recommended. We have never been treated so poorly, as a result we will never return there again. The food was mediocre at best. The only redeeming part was when we spoke to the manager she handled it very well."}
{"text":"Came to blue agave for dinner last night with my wife. The food was very tasty, I ordered a carne asada burrito with red enchilada sauce, my wife ordered a taco salad and a margarita, I ordered a blue moon.it took about 30 min to get our food but it was worth the wait, very generous portions so make sure to come with an appetite. The margarita was perfect and the waitress was very friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Went there about a year ago it was ok just had drinks But went on a Groupon tonight and had dinner with the family  and it was awesome the place looked a little different inside a lot nicer very clean . The service was great training a couple of new waiters but they had shadows with them and Still great service and the food was amazing we had steak fajitas , cheese crisp , and a chicken burrito all fresh and not heavy like some places serves mex food  drinks where spot on and kept our glasses filled. We will be coming back again!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! 
I swear the steak fajitas were made with ribeye steak - no cheap meat here. And the refreid beans - best I've ever had.

The rest of our party had enchilatas - good, rice bowl - good, and a buritto - good. A grand slam. Not often does everyone get a great meal when you try 4 different meals.

The bean dip is also great, had it as part of the dip sampler. Ice tea is solid.

As far a decor, it's not a dive, but a step up. But no one is walking around with their nose in the air (unlike some other Scottsdale joints). Service, well, its not terrible, but you're not coming here for the service. Come for the food! I know we'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is great.  Visit regularly. Love their enchiladas and chips and salsa are my favorite in town."}
{"text":"Not very happy with this place , I had the carne Asada plate and it was black burn :/ , husband had the 3 enchiladas and food was cold. I was able to hear and see the kitchen from my seat , the chips were stale . The host was very nice and the server also. But the thing that got to me the most was the walls .... extremely dirty YUCK !"}
{"text":"I went last night for dinner but I've been coming to this place for years due to its convenient location.  I have to be honest, I think the menu had radically improved!  I love their chips and salsa and if you love spicy you can ask for a hotter version.  We shared the Ultimate Chimichanga and it was bomb-delicious! They split our plates and I could only eat 1/2 of it! Great value especially when sharing!! I'm craving leftovers already! Going back very soon!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a couple appetizers and drinks here one night. We got skinny and organic margaritas and they were both fabulous. As others have said, The complimentary salsa is great and unique. We also ordered queso (so good) and kettle carne. We shared those two appetizers for dinner and it was plenty! We felt as if a meal would have been too much food since we are traveling and wouldn't have been able to take a to go box. We would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food was very good, very big portions. A good value for the money. Our waiter Ishmael was excellent."}
{"text":"We love Blue Agave, and have been coming for years.  The service is always very accommodating, friendly, and attentive.  We usually order the Chohulo (sp?) salad which isn't a typical taco salad, but a much different, \"spunkier\" type of meal! :) It's excellent.  We've also had the enchiladas and Owner's Burrito (I think it's called) and all are very, very tasty.  

They attract a vast array of people from business lunch-goers, to sports fans, to kids and older adults alike. There's something for everyone on their menu and we continue to call it one of our favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Decent food, but the absolute worst service ever. We sat for 10 minutes without being greeted or water, 10 more without ordering and then another 45 without food. We were so frustrated we ended up leaving after just having chips and salsa for over an hour. Sad. I called the manager and he couldn't have cared less."}
{"text":"My son & I came here to eat after an Adventure Run and ordered the chicken quesadilla & the chicken tender kid's meal. 
We were both disappointed with our meals. The chicken quesadilla did not have enough cheese in there and chicken tender in the kid's meal was not real chicken- it was processed. The fruit that came with the meal was not fresh, it was the canned fruit kind except it came in a plastic cup. So neither one of us really enjoyed our meal. The chicken quesadilla was a large portion size and came with sour cream & lettuce & tomato. The kid's meal portion was small. My son was still hungry afterwards. 
The complimentary chips & salsa was tasty. 
The place was packed with runners from the Adventure Run and it did not seem like they had enough waitstaff. My son had to grab the waiter twice to get his attention. 
Overall, the atmosphere is good. We would go back and give the menu another try but I would not recommend anything on the kid's menu. Better off ordering off of the regular menu and have leftover to take home for the kids."}
{"text":"Very Yummy lunch! Great atmosphere.  Outdoor patio! Staff was very attentive! You should go!"}
{"text":"Generous portions and good food.  I appreciatef the choice of black beans in addition to refried beans."}
{"text":"This place gets 2.5 stars (but I'll round up because I'm feeling generous this afternoon).  I come here with co-workers for lunch from time-to-time, and I have to admit that I agree with many of the other reviews:  the food isn't amazing.  But it's not horrible.  It's pretty inexpensive for what you get (they have a lunch menu with good prices and a great selection), and I think that the attentive and fast service combined with the convenient location are what make it keep coming up as a lunch suggestion again and again.  

This isn't anything that I would crave on the weekends, but when I just need to get out of the building for a sunshine fix on a workday and no one can agree on where to go for lunch....not a bad solution."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of Mexican Food but Blue Agave is my favorite now. I love a real margarita...since I was the winning Margarita Challenge in Cave Creek \"I really mean it \"REAL\" and I got it!!! I love Agave Spicy Margarita...kicked my Taste buds' butt!
The restaurant looks so nice and clean. Staff friendly and helpful.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We will come back!!
Big, cold beer!
Great fresh food
Excellent service 
We sat in the bar-"}
{"text":"We found this joint thanks to Groupon last year.  Since that first visit, we've been here a couple more times.  It's in a shopping center just off Mayo & Scottsdale Rd....for some reason, this shopping center doesn't do very well, places close down frequently.  We're happy that this hasn't. 

Here are some items we've had here:

Mexican Bean Dip, $4.99

Spinach Con Queso, $5.99 

Nachos, $8.99
 
Owner's Chimichanga (Shredded Chicken, Black Beans, Cheese, Rice, Pico de Gallo Charrio Sauce w/Jalapeno Cream Sauce and Green Chili Sauce, Sliced Poblano Peppers, Cheese, Shredded Lettuce and Sour Cream), $13.99 

Ultimate Chimichanga (Roasted Pork, Rice, Pinto Beans, Cheese, Green Chili Sauce and Pico de Gallo), $15.99

The food is very good.  My fav's are the Nachos & the Ultimate and Owner Chimichangas.  The Bean Dip and Spinach con Queso are very good too, but if you get those don't get a large entree like the Chimichangas because it's too much food.

The servers are friendly.  The restaurant can get packed during happy hour and peak dinner hours.

Overall, it's a nice neighborhood family restaurant.

Return Factor - 80%"}
{"text":"Meh.

Went here because of the Yelp deal after we saw a movie. Ordered the fish tacos and was really disappointed. You can tell they use frozen fish. I ordered the fish fried, traditional style, and it was rubbery and greasy. Honestly, I've had way better at a chain like Rubios for half the price. It didn't even come with lime, but a tangy sauce that was way too overpowering. The rice was dry, the queso fresco on my black beans was rotten and the beans weren't all the way cooked. Nasty. I ordered a quesadilla off the kids menu with a side of fruit for the kids. It was pretty small and the fruit was a fruit cup NOT fresh fruit. Why wouldn't you serve fresh fruit? However, the salsa was good. Very smokey (chipotle perhaps?)

Needless to say, I was unimpressed with the food.

On the upside, the margaritas were good (and strong!). I had the skinny and my husband had a blended strawberry. They also have really good happy hour specials. The service was ok. Nothing spectacular but not bad.

I'd probably return for happy hour but definitely not for the food. It's pretty much a sports bar (lots of flat screens playing sports) that serves gringo style Mexican food."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable $$$$, and more important a good staff and mgmt.    we go almost on a weekly basis, and we always get a wave from the mgr and other servers.  Very friendly place.  Good margaritas!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give six stars I would. Let me start with Kenna and Kristin. Awesome awesome service from both. The food was amazing as we're the prices. Happy Hour was amazing,  the pork street were to die for. The atmosphere is lively,  beautiful breeze flowing though the open doors. I can't say enough about the food. If I lived in the area this would be my joint!!"}
{"text":"Just like previous reviews:  atmosphere great, food great but female bartender very rude and inattentive.  Not sure why management would keep her when patrons feel this way. Will return when service is better."}
{"text":"I suggested eating here tonight because usually the service is decent and the food is good. Tonight the service was absolutely awful! It took FOREVER to get a server and then it was order and wait and wait...it took over 20 minutes just to get guacamole, an appetizer! We had 3 kids meals, fish tacos and street tacos. It took 10 minutes to get our drinks and I was done with my margarita and would have ordered another one of it hadn't taken the server over 15 minutes AFTER I FINISHED to even ask me if I wanted another. I literally said if you had asked me 10 minutes ago I would have said yes. Utterly ridiculous that our food took 40 minutes to get to our table considering that we had 3 KIDS meals! We won't be going back."}
{"text":"This is amazing! Love the food so much. Service is super attentive as well!!! The complementary chips are delicious as well. Would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great staff by Maria I love coming here for late night food and happy hour!"}
{"text":"Great service topped with Amazing food. A touch more expensive but worth the extra money. Large portions"}
{"text":"I was there on Friday afternoon. It was my first time here. Eddie was our waiter. He was friendly, helpful and patient while we figured out what we wanted to order. My friend and I shared the bbq chicken salad. It was so big, we each had some at the restaurant and had enough for a meal to take home. We also got the mini churros and the cookie dough dessert. All the food was unbelievable and Eddie was really great. Thank you for the great food and wonderful customer service. I will be back again."}
{"text":"Food poisoning from this place. Avoid it. I would give it negative stars. I am still sick in bed from last night."}
{"text":"This place based on what it could be... is a Dud.

Food is so-so.  Salsa is like marinara sauce. They say it is fresh guac, but it looks and tastes like it is out of a can.

They have cool yelp check in discounts.  But the food is just average.  I think Sandbar has just as good food, and better chips salsa and guac, if you are looking to do Bar type Mexican food."}
{"text":"Tried this place out on a whim one night. Sat in the bar area and this was a great choice. Bartender was friendly and attentive.  He suggested the organic Margarita and all I can say is WOW! I have never had such a tasty and refreshing margrita. This was followed up by a equally delicious Carne asada rice bowl. Their menu is different and exciting. They also offer a good variety of better tequilas. Oh and they have a reverse happy hour. All around a good place will be going back."}
{"text":"The spicy boneless pork ribs are one of my favorite dishes of any mexican restaurant I have been to.  Easily a pound of meat in a zesty sauce covered in melting cheese.  The margaritas however suck.  Zero tequila"}
{"text":"Really nicely plated. One entree was hot and other two served lukewarm. Good salsa. Nothing special flavor wise on any of our entrees. Long wait for food. Margaritas would be more appropriately called 'dwarf margaritas.'  I at one point found myself wondering how you can screw up ice water. Answer = put only three ice cubes in it and serve it tepid, if asked for more water, walk off with the glass and return it with the apparently standard three-cube tepid temp fill. Not a dining experience we'll be repeating unless he'll freezes over."}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday for Happy Hour. The service, prices and food are fantastic! The salsa is mild, but flavorful, the street tacos (2 per plate) are extremely meaty and delish. The nacho are a share size, the bean dip was just okay, nothing wrong, but nothing special, so we'd order 2-nachos next time and skip the bean dip and all appetizers I mentioned are $3.49!!!! It was four of us and our bill was $39.00, making it $10.00 a person with beers and margarita for each! Excellent... We left full and with a desire to return!!! Great choice"}
{"text":"Took about 35 people from a Think Tank I hosted this week. Killer chips & Guacamole.  Fish Tacos were incredible.  TV's hanging everywhere which is good because I need the scores. I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Very cool place with a funky New England - New Mexico menu and excellent and friendly service. A bit off the beaten path, but great when you visit Taliesin West."}
{"text":"We love Blue Agave.  The food is fresh, service is good.  My fiancés favorite meal was the steak on top of the garlic mashed potatoes but unfortunately they recently changed their menu which I was not as impressed with. Their happy hour menu is great with plenty of choices.  Even though the menu changed, we will continue to eat there...we still love it."}
{"text":"Went In late Saturday evening on 3-7 and encountered a very rude female bartender with long dark hair. She acted as if we were bothering her, news flash.. Your job is customer service. Defiantly won't be coming back."}
{"text":"A great selection of mid grade tequila (patron anejo, herradura reposado and 1942!  Foods good too!

Chicken street tacos super!"}
{"text":"I have been to Blue Agave every Sunday, when my favorite football team plays. They have a very solid staff in place with a good selection of food. Everything tried may not fit my style, but it's highly recommended to everyone to try. That's what unique about the Blue Agave. The staff is friendly and has a great atmosphere on any occastion."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place out last night. Big mistake. To begin with, the food was not very impressive. The salsa had an interesting flavor that both my husband and I did not enjoy. The chips were bland and greasy. We ordered the spicy cholula wings, and they were not up to our expectations. I ordered the street tacos and they were pretty good, they just lacked flavor. My husband disliked his green sauce chicken burrito and thought it was bland as well. 

So even if the food was not great this first time around, we possibly may have come back. That is, until our waiter \"Ishmael\" COMPLETELY FORGOT ABOUT US halfway through our meal and left us waiting for our check for 30 minutes. Yes, that's right. We kept waiting and waiting for him to show up to our table and he completely vanished... Even the other waiters nearby saw us waiting and decided to ignore us as well. I have never been to a restaurant with such horrible service. Eventually I had to walk to the waiters station and ask someone for the check because they were wasting our time. Even up until the moment we left Ishmael never showed up to our table again! I will Never come here again and will strongly discourage anyone I know from coming here. I'm extremely disappointed with the service from this restaraunt ... How can you completely ignore your PAYING customers??!"}
{"text":"I don't like Mexican food as a general rule. I don't like beans. I don't like sour cream or guac.  It's all gross. But I was pleasantly surprised when  my gf and I went here.  It was close and had a Yelp deal so we tried it out. We've actually been there twice. The food was great. I had a braised pork dish.  The place wasn't packed which I liked. Pretty chill please. You can have a conversation.  Dessert was awesome. The cookie dough taquitos or whatever they were.  I didn't give 5 stars because I wasn't blown away.  But my expectations were exceeded.  I will def go back"}
{"text":"Our favorite place for Taco Tuesday! Great food and very friendly staff. Always a fun spot to meet friends. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Very clean, nice atmosphere and very well air conditioned. 
Food was delicious. Not a big fan of the rice and my hubby's mojitos was a lil on the strong side. 
We tried both the salsa they give you with the chips and asked for a hotter one. Both were equally tasty. The hot one has more of a smokey flavor to it. 
Our server 127 not sure of his name but he was great. Very helpful, and funny. We deff. Enjoyed coming to this place. If you're in the area or passing through stop here it's awesome!"}
{"text":"Food can be much better. Service is decent . I tried the fish taos and veggie fajitas. Veggie Fajitas are better. 

Certainly overpriced for the quality of food being offered."}
{"text":"The food is good AZ Mexican food. What really differentiates this place is the dessert. Chocolate chip cookie dough chimichangas. Unbelievable. Get them!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend before heading to the movies.  I bought the Yelp Deal which was a gift certificate $10 for $20 towards your purchase.   The servers were very friendly and knowledgeable.  We had the endless chips and salsa and 2 shredded beef tacos!  The salsa was delicious and the tacos were very tasty.  

The happy hour drinks are also a great deal.  This place is  perfect to stop at before a movie or even for happy hour or dinner!"}
{"text":"My main reason for the new rating is for effort. I have realized with this place too it is very important when you go there to eat. If it is during college football season when they are busy you will get a much better dinner. Other times not as good and service may not be as good. The owner is a very nice man who seems to truly care an love what he does.   

I will try this again in the fall :)"}
{"text":"Our favorite, family friendly Mexican comfort place. 

It's reasonably priced, decent food, family friendly and good service. 

A place to just hang out or a default place where the whole family can find something to eat."}
{"text":"Was a little disappointed in my first time at Blue Agave.i had heard so many great things,unfortunately I wasn't too impressed. A buddy of mine and I sat  at the bar for Taco Tuesday. Ordered a nacho with no jalapeños  , and my nacho came out loaded with them. Spent several minutes picking those off. Also once we got our food, no refills on waters. Don't recommend the house margarita for happy hour/ taco Tuesday deal, it was real bad. Way to sweet, and just too cheap. There had been 2 servers at the bar and an occasional wandering manager, and still real bad service.. maybe a bad night for them, maybe too high of an expectation to receive decent service, I don't know. Probably wouldn't return nor suggest it to others. Way to many good Mexican restaurants to choose from.."}
{"text":"Chimichanga was amazing, spicy and perfect! The skinny margarita was mostly ice which was a bummer. Kids quesadilla meal is pretty plain and it is not fresh fruit, which was a downfall. I would totally go again to try a different drink and hopefully catch happy hour!"}
{"text":"I have been to Blue Agave Mexican Cantina on Mayo Blvd. several times before (at least 6 times), and enjoyed it. But this visit was disappointing. The restaurant is clean, hostess and server were friendly and efficient, and young lady kept the iced tea and water glasses filled with a smile. But the food for a weekday lunch was just average. The menu online is different than the menu in the restaurant. The hatch chili chicken corn chowder that previously won best chowder award from Phoenix magazine was no longer on the menu. Neither were mini chimis or some of the New Mexican options.  Chips and salsa were nothing special. What happened? We probably won't be back again as there are other Mexican options nearby with a better menu. Next time... Jalapeno Inferno because of better luncheon selections. But guessing that if you just want standard tacos, burritos,  fajitas and drinks, this could still be your place."}
{"text":"We took advantage of the Yelp deal and decided to give this place a chance.  Overall it was a great experience.  The service was fantastic and the food was really good.  The chips did not seem homemade to me, or at least not super fresh.  Our entrees were really good and I loved that the chicken tacos were not smothered in cheese and sour cream. The only reason I'm not giving 4 stars is because I thought it was a little pricey for what you got. The margaritas on happy hour are $4 and very small.  Not typical of a Mexican restaurant.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Agave is a shining example of what white American culture has done to the deep rooted cooking methods of Mexico. They lure you in with friendly wait staff, overflowing baskets of (passable) chips and salsa, and prices that imply upper end mexican fare. Unfortunately this is all a ruse. The tacos are small, and wrapped in thick, gooey store bought flour tortillas, and the meat is seasoned to the taste of a toddler's palate. The beans taste like salt paste, and the rice very well may be from a box. In short, this is a sit down restaurant serving drive-thru quality food."}
{"text":"Prompt and friendly service, and the food was delicious! The complimentary salsa and chips were perfect to start our meal...chips were fresh and the salsa was delicious. The owners chimichanga, the traditional tacos, and the enchiladas were on point...great flavors, great spice and all around great choices! Would definitely come back here!!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place for happy hour. The house margarita is a pre made mix. You can upgrade from a small to a large for an extra $1 but they don't physically pour tequila in it as it's already premade (which is disappointing ). The pomegranate margarita was delicious. There was the Coronarita one which was also good and you could taste the liquor. The guac was good and the chips are hot. They serve complimentary chips and salsa. The guy bartender with the beard was excellent. He was always attentive and on top of our drinks."}
{"text":"Went to blue agave last night for taco Tuesday. My girlfriend and I got food poisoning and still have symptoms 24 hours later. Beware of dollar tacos because taco Tuesday will lead to vomit vednesday. Sever was nice though so I will give it a star. I pretty much don't want to ever eat Mexican food ever again for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"Good food great service and a nice atmosphere. Reasonably priced. Good margarita selection. They even kept the families with kids on the other side of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I had a Chimichanga & a beer at happy hour & with a 20% tip it was $30.  It was very average tasting. For that price I expected much better.  Chimi was 15.99 + 3.00 extra for carne asada so $19.00 and there was mostly rice & Beans in the chimi.  Chipoltle gives more meat and it tastes much better for less than half the price. I used a yelp coupon so it cut my cost to $20. still wasn't worth it. for good Mexican food I recommend La Parilla Suiza on Stapely off the 60. I like  #15 on the menu.  It's far but worth the drive once in a while. The one on 35th Ave is not as good."}
{"text":"There are a lot of choices for Mexican cuisine in my neck of the woods, almost a dozen within a few miles of my home in north Scottsdale, and we have tried them all.....and we keep coming back to blue agave.   The food is really good, always consistent, fresh chips and salsa, great fulfilling entrees, and fantastic margaritas at a fair price.....and most important to us, great service every time.  It's not that I wouldn't visit the other restaurants, but when you just want a good meal at a good deal, this place is a can't miss.  Recommend the Sonoran rolls, fajitas, and the ultimate chimi is fantastic.  Great dining area, or if you just want to grab a beer with friends at happy hour, it has a fun bar side as well."}
{"text":"I don't really know why people don't like this place.  It is American Mexican food and is always good.  The salsa is amazing, and the pork burrito I had was perfect.  Try this place you will like it."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the worst Mexican restaurants I have been to!  Mediocre service!  Boring food!  Boring salsa!  Never again!!!"}
{"text":"This is our all time favorite mexican restaurant! The food is delicious,  fresh & yummy! Chips are warm from an oven with fresh salsa. My favorite is the chicken fajitas!"}
{"text":"ULTIMATE CHIMICHANGA!!!!

Need I say more?

I went there, not once, not twice, but three frigging times this last week because of the Phoenix Film Festival.  It was amazing all three times.

I love their chips/salsa and like the headline says.. the Ultimate Chimichanga was insanely delicious.  In fact, I am craving it as I type this.  I wish you were closer Chimi!

Good service, the people are always on top of your drinks/chips and anything else you need. The place can be pricey, so watch the drinks you order.  

I cant wait to go again. :)"}
{"text":"Came based on yelp deal. 5pm and zero customers. This should have been my warning. My lemon in the water was already squeezed and that scares me. Ordered taco salad and a 16$ chimichanga. Had leftovers and left them there. Very sad excuse for Mexican food. Salsa was good....but the \"hot salsa \" tasted like water. Waiter said that was the only hot sauce they had. What mexican restaurant doesn't have tapatio or cholula.? Regardless we left a 30% tip and left it at that!"}
{"text":"This place is a good bet for decent happy hour food and drinks at good prices.  I came a little after 9:30 on a week night and it was not busy, but there were a few tables in the bar area. The server was attentive, polite and food came out hot and quick. Can't say it's the most authentic Mexican food, nor the very best, but it certainly has a place in the world and I will be back. The patio is nice too."}
{"text":"The food was great and the chip sampler was a great idea and should be done at all Mexican restaurants. Didn't care for the Bama stuff lol. But I was in my Buckeye gear anyways!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband came across this place a while back and had a really nice dinner there. We liked it so much that we kept coming back.

The atmosphere is inviting and fun. Good for a group of friends or a date night. They have a great happy hour with their yummy queso dip that I always get! 

This place has awesome margaritas, as well as yummy chips and salsa that is complimentary. 

Try it out and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Just got back from the Blue Agave....I have to say, at first I was shocked in the menu to see wraps and burgers listed, and I almost freaked out, because my dad and his girlfriend are in from Rhode Island and wanted to go to a nice Mexican restaurant. I was thinking to myself I heard this was a Mexican restaurant, and I thought I was going to almost cower into a corner somewhere for making such a poor dinner choice. However, as I looked on the back of the menu, there were some old tried and true favorites of this Latin cuisine, fajita's, enchilada's and the like. I did pretty much gasp (to myself of course, I wasn't paying  for the meal) at the prices. For this genre of food, I was surprised that the meals ranged from $10 a plate and up. In my eyes, that is ridiculous. But they do give you an ungodly amount of food, and it is stuff you can reheat again that actually tastes good. This is my reasoning for giving this establishment only three stars. In my mind, there are cheaper Mexican restaurants with food just as good if not better. I thought the decor was interesting, but there is no real level of ambiance here. If you are looking for that you have the wrong place. It almost reminds me of a very hip college hang out. The waiter we had was fantastic and very attentive. I can appreciate the fact he did not call me Ma'am, as I am sensitive now that I am 30. I have mixed feelings on whether or not I would return. I do agree with the gentleman who said it was 'eh....I think there are a lot more fantastic restaurants in the area I need to frequent before I go to this one again. It remains to be seen is all I can say."}
{"text":"Meh. A little expensive and food was average. I had the carne asada and it was ok. Wife had the ground beef tacos and they were not good. Waiter was nice, but we didn't get the side of veggies we ordered. With so much competition for Mexican food in town, we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Back again! This time I tried the Mexican pizza and it was delicious. The chicken fajitas are some of the best around. My date ordered the grilled carne asada which is his usual. I love the salsa and they have an extra spicy one if you ask for it. The staff is always attentive and the food is spot on. Blue Agave is consistent and clean. I like the prices and there's always a coupon available on Yelp or the Entertainment Guide. If you are craving modern mexican for a reasonable price in Scottsdale, check them out. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It had been years since my last visit to Blue Agave.  The fact that Blue Agave is still here after many years says they are doing plenty that is right in a business that is hard to achieve long term success.  Had dinner on a recent Monday night.  Casual and easy dining, football on TV, reasonably busy with other guests both inside and out (on patio).   We were seated right away and promptly greeted by our enthusiastic server and a delivery of chips & salsa.  We ordered fish tacos (fried) and traditional chicken enchiladas, both came with rice & beans.  The fish tacos were more of a wrap served in flour tortilla.  Taste was very good, and I loved the slightly spicy sauce.  Only complaint was the rather skimpy portion of fish in the taco wrap.  The enchiladas were also good and nicely dressed in a tasty sauce. 

I would stack Blue Agave high against other Mexican restaurants I have recently tried.  I was pleasantly surprised by my experience and will plan to return, perhaps to sit on a very inviting patio for lunch or happy hour.  They are also close to Harkins 101 movie theatre."}
{"text":"Awesome service! We sat down and were served chips and salsa within thirty seconds. Julie, the bartender, was so nice and knowledgable. She made fantastic margaritas and helped us pick out which tacos to order (also fantastic). Julie was obviously very busy, but took the time with us to make sure we had everything we needed. We had a great experience!"}
{"text":"DOG FRIENDLY patio seating!

Eddie is our go to server, and while the taco prices for taco Tuesday have gone up since we started going here, it is still very reasonable. Buy the Yelp or Groupon deal when they have it if you plan to visit on a night when they don't have a special. We sit on the patio and ask them to turn on the heaters when it is (kind of) cold and they always do it when we ask. A great crew that has gotten greater with time and good management. The bartender loves dogs and always comes to say hi to Baby (our dog) and EVERY TIME she washes her hands before going back to work, talk about being mindful and a professional!"}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time last week and was pleasantly surprised. Our waitress was a rock star and gave great recommendations. I am really sensitive to spicy food and she gave me a great option to get sauce on the side so I could control the temperature. The special chimichanga was HUGE but was so good, I ate the entire thing. Even our waitress was impressed. My husband got crispy tacos which were awesome! The shell was lite, crispy, and flavorful. We had cookie dough chimis for dessert which were very rich but very good. Pineapple upside down cake was also delicious. Good place for Mexican food that doesn't feel super heavy."}
{"text":"Food was good. Service was less than perfect. Went without a drink for 15 min or so, which was probably fine anyway bc the drinks were weak. Might give it one more try since I did like the carne asada rice bowl."}
{"text":"This place was great. So glad my mom and I stopped in here. Delicious chicken tacos and great service. Will definitely return here in the future. A++"}
{"text":"I come here late night for Josh :) he is such an amazing bartender that I will follow no matter what :)"}
{"text":"On a Friday night around 6:30, we had to wait about 5 minutes for a booth. Not bad. Ordered margaritas that were soso. Definitely a mix and not made with fresh limes. I had their signature Ultimate Chimichanga. Meh. I don't think that I'll rush back here any time soon."}
{"text":"Listen up, I'm full Mexican and I grew up with a mom that cooked the best authentic Mexican food while I was growing up.  I'm very picky when it comes to eating at Mexican restaurants.  It's hard to separate my homemade mother's creations with what they serve at some of these places.  

I ordered the Carne Asada pizza with jalapenos on top.  I shared it with my wife and I regret not getting my own.  It was pretty delicious and well created.

The homemade salsa was meh.  Too sweet for my liking.  I love heat in my salsa so I asked for one with more kick and they brought over a fire roasted salsa.  It was a little hotter, but it still didn't catch my taste buds.  

I would come back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I get the Ultimate Chimichanga every single time. I've tried a few other items, but this is my favorite. They send coupons via email frequently, so that's usually when we come in, but the waiter conveniently forgets to add them to our bill each time. Hmm... suspicious?

Oh well, not afraid to correct that problem! We pay full price no problem, but if you can get a deal, why not? Heck, we actually come here every other time because we have a coupon.


This is our favorite spot to go to because we can't always justify going to WCG across the parking lot. I'd say we're here once every other month and we never get tired of it. Great food."}
{"text":"Came for dinner and it was excellent! Ordered the spinach queso dip which was very good! Would suggest the steak fajitas!"}
{"text":"It's a good place for lunch, but for dinner the meals are over priced. The lunch menu is still a little spendy for a lunch meal. Try the special soup, the creamy jalapeno, it's fantastic."}
{"text":"Great happy hour with cheap margs is the best thing Blue Agave has to offer. Atmopshere is lacking. Not fun or authentic. Maybe after a couple of margs, it appears to be decent but really not a hot spot that makes me want to go back. There are other local places for HH nearby so I wouldn't go out of the way to come here. Foodwise I wouldn't really bother."}
{"text":"Shopping nearby so we gave it a try, and man we were glad we did! My husband and I shared a Chimichanga and left throughly satisfied. The pork, cooked on site was outstanding as was the sauce and presentation. Service was professional and friendly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visit here almost weekly, because the staff is great, the food is excellent and the drinks are top-notch!

I recommend (like most) the Ultimate Chimichanga, and their jalepeno cream soup is out of this world. If you're looking for something more traditional, their stuffed relleno is awesome. My wife loves their rice bowl.

They often send out coupons and good deals on yelp and groupon. A must-try! Thanks to the Blue Agave staff for always taking care of us."}
{"text":"Tonight's dinner was a very pleasant experience for my husband and myself!    Being vegetarians,  there were enough options and the food was very well prepared.   The margaritas were also very good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and helpful staff.  I got the Kettle Carne, which came out as a very tasty build it yourself pork taco assembly line, very flavorful!"}
{"text":"Can't believe you only have 3 reviews, what's wrong with people, there were tons of them when I ate there last night!!! lol

I brought in a group of movie goers from Harkins, we saw Eat Pray Love, and the experience was top notich!

Attentive staff, tasty food (I had chicken fajitas), and strong drinks :) (had strawberry margarita), and dynamic company made for a most enjoyable experience. 

No idea where your 2.5 star weighed average rating came from, my guess is those who reviewed you were perhaps inebriated when they wrote it ? :)

See you soon,
Matthew"}
{"text":"Service awful... Went for lunch. 
Food very bland.. They forgot ingredients in my salad . Not impressed . Will not return"}
{"text":"Not sure where to start. Poor service, food and drinks.

My wife and I went there today for lunch. Our waiter made our cocktails because \"the bartender sucks.\" Well, the waiter sucked at making ours too. At a slow time (like 3pm), tables were messy and service was slow. 

Their salsa is like spicy, smoky ketchup. I had the spinach enchiladas and they were bland. My wife had the fish tacos and I think the fish was kids' fish sticks. 

Blue Agave is that bad. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Let's start with the margaritas. Lots of choices. I got the Organic with no salt. Super tart, but yummy. No problem inhaling it. Perhaps it was really good because it was Cinco de Mayo; or perhaps because it was just a good smooth margarita. 

There were three of us at this little Cinco de Mayo \"party.\" We ordered three appetizers from their regular & their HH menus. They were good and more than enough to fill us up . . . well, along with the party drinks. No need for additional heavy main entrees.

A good stop off before the movie."}
{"text":"Food was very good but the wait time to receive food after ordering was a bit long with only a couple of people in the whole place. All in all, if I was in this area I would definitely not hesitate to stop in."}
{"text":"Food is awesome! I have eaten here more than a hundred times and the food never disappoints. For an appetizer, order the shrimp nachos. For entree, either the grilled chicken soft tacos or ultimate chimichanga. 

Despite what other people write, the drinks are AMAZING. The bartenders will make up drinks for you, just tell them what are you in the mood for. During football season there is breakfast available along with a Bloody Mary bar. Need I say more.... 
I have never had a bad experience here. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. But what sets this place apart from the rest are the fabulous drinks. Have Collins, Matt, or Joe create a drink for you."}
{"text":"great selection of traditional Mexican dishes and some great specialty plates as well - the boneless pork is simply awesome.  Aslo, my favorite margarita in the city is here- the Saguaro Blossom!  Always good service whether at the bar or seated in the restaurant portion"}
{"text":"First time. Came using a groupon. Wasn't wow'd by anything, but the place is nice. Their perfect margarita was very good however!!

I got the ultimate chimichanga and the wife got the carne asada pizza. Both we're ok. Chips and salsa are really good. Salsa has a hint of chipotle and chips were hot and thin. 

Would come back only of in the area. Not close to home."}
{"text":"The Best.  Chicken wings are out of this world.The pork Ribs, everything the fish, the steak, shrimp all out of this world. It also has a great Bar.  This is Not for babies & kids at all!!!This is a romantic Hideaway"}
{"text":"The service and food here is consistently great.  Nice atmosphere too, kind of like a neighborhood sports bar.  We have never had a long wait either and we are always very satisfied with wait staff and our meals are delicious."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate there for the first time Friday evening.  We were pleased with the quality of the food and the customer service.  I knock it down to 4 stars because the food is a little expensive for what you get and the University of Alabama Sports Bar atmosphere is not that attractive."}
{"text":"Great happy hour spot! And the gluten free menu is extensive! Very pleased, I'll be back very soon! Queso dip was out of this world."}
{"text":"We are new to Phoenix & have been looking for a good Mexican Restaurant. Blue Agave was recommended and we were not disappointed. The taquitos were hot, crunchy and totally delicious, as was the fish tacos and crunchy tacos. We will eat there again and will recommend to friends."}
{"text":"As a transplant to North Scottsdale I noticed the lack of real Mexican food. Blue Agave isn't what I would call real Mexican food but it is still a really good place eat. My family and myself dine here at least once a week and I can vouch that their fajitas, enchiladas, and I know my dad father loves their shrimp salad. Their chips and salsa are tasty and the drinks are relatively cheap and you can usually find a $10 for $20 coupon on here which makes it a good value."}
{"text":"Why can't the restaurants that I LOVE the most be closer to me?? Oh well, this place is worth the 30 minute drive!! Hey, it's all freeway as Blue Agave is just south of the 101 at Scottsdale Road.

LOVE this place!! The whiner who complains his favorite bartender is gone (secret crush??) and now this place isn't the same is LOCO!! Don't bash this place because you are upset the bartender left!! Give me a break!! It's about the FOOD, the ambiance (NICE) and GOOD service!! Our server wasn't super overly engaging/friendly tonight but DAMN she was a good server beyond expectations!! You don't have to kiss my ass or buddy up to me or make me feel \"special\", just make sure my wants/need are met or even foreseen like this evening, serve me the YUMMY Blue Agave food and I'll leave HAPPY!! Yes, another PERFECT meal and perfect service!!! 

So happy to have discovered this place!! (See my recent previous review where my sister and I ate THREE DAYS IN A ROW at Blue Agave!! Our first visit lead us to crave and eat the next two days here! Now hubby is hooked too!!)

This time we ordered the pork burrito, mixed chicken and beef fajitas and a chicken strip kids meal. The pork burrito was just as delicious as I have come to expect!! It boasts HUGE chunky pieces of perfectly cooked and flavorful pork!! Love the green sauce and the presentation!! The fajitas were awesome (picture shows mostly chicken but lots of beef was buried under the pile of chicken...A LOT of meat!!!) and the huge portion of pico, sour cream, cheese and lettuce topped it off perfectly (pictures do not accurately depict the huge portions)!! We ordered extra tortillas and were shocked to see that we got FOUR home made steamy and tasty hot flour tortillas for only $1.00!!

Excuse me for taking pictures of my cell phone pictures. I have to admit I don't know how to transfer pictures from my cell phone to my computer. I rarely take the time to take or even post pictures but I felt these are worthy of posting, even if they aren't of the best quality!! The quality of the pictures are not so good, but the food is delicious!!! 

My hubby prefers to eat nearby. It is not often that he agrees that the drive is worth the time, gas and miles on his PRECIOUS truck, but this is one of the few places he agrees is worthy of the trip!! We are regulars now for sure!! See you soon, Blue Agave!!"}
{"text":"The service was impeccable so three stars for that. The food was, meh. Presentation was good but it seemed quite Americanized. Very good choice of cocktails. Clean and open for business until late. All in all, a bit unremarkable."}
{"text":"Mexican food is one of our favorites, and Blue Agave was okay. What stood out was the server. She was extremely attentive, polite, and quick to answer our questions. The food itself was average Mexican food. Some of the steak fajitas were somewhat fatty and tough to chew. My wife had the tres enchiladas and was not too big of a fan of the red sauce. The portion sizes were great. Overall, some decent food, but there are better Mexican restaurants out there."}
{"text":"Trash, there are 50 million mexican restaurants in az. I would rather eat at filbertos then this place. Save the money and go to any of the 6 within 2 miles of this place that are actually good."}
{"text":"We got the chicken burrito and jefe pollo.  Both were tasty, but way more food than a normal size human should be able to eat in one sitting. I highly recommend the chipotle cream sauce. Wait staff was really nice, but the abundant number of big screen tvs detracted from the otherwise pleasant atmosphere. As far as Mexican food goes, it won't blow your mind, but it will probably hit the spot."}
{"text":"Amazing flavor!...
Anything that we tried was very flavorful... Happy hour offers good value.

Will be back here again."}
{"text":"So the other night we had a work party here. We reserved a large number of tables. Had amazing food, excellent drinks and a lot of unneeded karaoke.  Hahahah awesome spot"}
{"text":"Good chips and salsa, and a great venue with lots of room inside and a large outdoor patio too.  Unfortunately, every time I've been here it's been relatively empty.  But I think that's the day/time I come.  I would like to try again during a busy time or a Friday/Saturday.  Looks like it could be  a fun place to watch football.  They have Alabama signs hanging up so I think they would have their games on."}
{"text":"I went here last night with my mom because we were having a girl's night and we had a coupon for bogo entrees. So we walk in and are seated promptly, no problem. Our server is nice enough and brings us chips and salsa. I think the salsa is made with chipotles because it is spicy and smokey... I liked it, it's not exactly what you would expect, but that's nice sometimes. I ended up ordering the chicken caliente at the waiter's suggestion and my mom ordered the baja enchiladas. So my dish is this huge butterflied chicken breast where one side has chipotle cream sauce and one side has jalapeno sauce and it's served over mashed potatoes with just a couple little quesadilla wedges. The chicken was decent, it was spicy! (which was a good thing) but the chicken itself was a bit chewy. Also, the potatoes definitely tasted like they were from a box, if they weren't I would be shocked. My mom's enchiladas were filled with shrimp and covered in the chipotle cream sauce. She seemed to like it a lot, I don't eat shrimp though, so I can't evaluate it really. So the bottom line is that if I had another coupon, I would consider going back, otherwise  I don't think it's worth it as it is just ok."}
{"text":"I came across this place after work and my coworker and I would like to rest something good yet quick. The orders put in are chicken lettuce wrap and fish taco with grilled fish. Great food, fresh and juicy, everything was beyond my expectation. The girls working here are warm and attentive, and I got extra big bag chips to take home!"}
{"text":"Lunch review:  
Great quick lunch options. I'm a big fan of the lunch salads.  They are very filling (paired with the free chips and salsa!!)  My favorite is the Chipotle Chicken Salad (Mixed lettuce, black beans, roasted corn, cheese mix, pico de gallo topped with grilled chicken)-- it's only $6.99.  The spunky chipotle dressing is delish.  There are also several lunch-sized versions of dinner plates available for diners looking for a heartier meal.  The service is always friendly and were are able to get in and out in less than an hour, which is very convenient during a busy work day."}
{"text":"This a neighborhood favorite of mine. I love the bartender Art and all the staff. They are great! Food is always good too."}
{"text":"This was recommended to me by lifetime fitness. I thought the food was terrible! guacamole had flavor.  the salsa was lackluster, consisting of tomatoes and cilantro in the little spices. THe shrimp salad nothing to write home about whatsoever. the tortilla soup consisted of the bland broth, chicken parts and guacamole and tortilla's floating on top"}
{"text":"You want to run away from the bar scene but still watch sports, well this is the place. Chips and salsa are great and no complaints about the food. Go and enjoy."}
{"text":"Good food, service and ambience. The quantity is too much, therefore one cannot eat completely. I would suggest to serve small portions so that people like me would like to visit every week.  I ordered chimichanga burrito and enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time as we were seeing a movie next door. Overall, the food was find, service was good, and the restaurant was clean. It has sort of a bar feel, but it's difficult to see the TV's from the dining area and the bar is completely cut off from the dining room, leading to a very segregated feel.

Nothing wrong with our experience, but nothing special either. A true, middle-of-the-road 3 stars."}
{"text":"I've only ever ordered delivery from here thru doordash but every time I do, the food is phenomenal. My kids love the nachos with ground beef, while I very much recommend the sonoran rolls for an appetizer (who knew you can make the perfect combo of mexican and sushi??), as well the traditional enchiladas with the chicken. Their cilantro lime rice as well as the jalapeno cream sauce on top the enchis are a great touch. Can't  wait to come in in person sometime!"}
{"text":"Not awful, not great. Both food and service. Waited close to an hour to get our meal. Server did acknowledge kitchen was backed up, but still seemed a long wait. Took a long time to get my second glass of wine. Ordered the House Chimichanga which had two chilis by it indicating very hot. No heat whatsoever. The meal was fine, but not something I have any desire to repeat."}
{"text":"Entrees are notable here, one of the following two should be in your future.  First, the Blue Cali Burrito - spinach tortilla filled with rice, jalapeno beans, guacamole, sour cream, shredded lettuce and pico.  Second, the Tres Enchiladas- 3 corn tortillas filled and topped with jalapeno sauce, chipotle cream sauce, red chili sauce cheese (rice/beans on side).   

Spinach con queso dip is above average as well, and some good deals can be had at happy hour.  Otherwise, prices are a little high and it's not a very charming location in a strip mall between a furniture store and border's books."}
{"text":"This is a very convenient and easy location to scare up some happy hour fun, even if it's not happy hour. I really love their margarita selection, and I usually choose a higher end one. The Agave is my favorite by far, but I also like The Diamond. However, it must be said that both of these are completely bartender dependent so somewhat inconsistent, which can be a little frustrating because of the premium price. If I'm in a \"bulk drinking\" mode, the house frozen margarita is really good. Better than a lot of other places upgraded ones. They use a decent reposado in their recipe, which makes a difference. I don't know if they make their own mix, but if not, whatever they use is pretty good. Sweet, of course, but better than many others I've tried. They serve beer and it's cold, says my husband. So, drinks are covered, but what about the food? Not so much...not bad, really, but not good either. If I was only rating this as a bar, they would definitely get 4 to 5 stars. But, the food and inconsistent service reduces my rating by a star.

The one thing we do like is the spinach queso dip at happy hour time. It is really good, and they put little chunks of cream cheese in it, which is YUMMY. They are VERY stingy with the pico de gallo though, Usually about 1 teaspoon on the whole dish. We have been charged inconsistently for a side of pico to add. It has ranged from 99 cents to $2.49. The other downside is that their house salsas are both awful. Truly awful. They are chipotle something or other, but they taste like ketchup with a burnt rubber aroma. Yucky. That's a downside. The food is OK. I've tried a salad, the chimichanga (which is labeled very spicy and IS NOT), which comes with burnt rubber sauce, so ask for them to leave it off. My husband had the shrimp enchiladas, which were \"OK, but kind of rubbery and a little fishy\" and a shredded pork burrito, which he says was good and will be what he orders from now on. We have also had their nachos, which are OK too."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for a Groupon dinner.  We got an appetizer assortment , an entree each, and a house margarita.  The app plate came with mini chimichangs (yay), chicken taquitos (yay), cheese quesadilla (nay), and wings (ok).  I had a decent chicken fajita, and my friend loved her steak fajitas.  The drinks were a little too strong in my opinion.  Overall, I would need another try at this place without the Groupon deal, and see if they can execute more flavorful food."}
{"text":"Crack sauce!!! It starts with an O, lots of good things start with O! Hehe! But they hands down have the best fish tacos in the valley!! Hands down!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  The ambiance is perfect for a quick dinner or for happy hour.  The margaritas are blissful.  I like the Organic and the Jefe.  As for the food-their salsa is delicious and their food is pretty consistent.  I have tried the tacos, the chili relleno and the tres enchiladas and they are all delectable. Service can be a little spotty in the dining area but it is always quick in the bar and where they have high tops to sit at. I always leave full and happy!"}
{"text":"Took my two sons to Blue Agave for dinner after the Giants vs Cubs preseason game.  Service was excellent and portions big.  Excellent ambiance sitting on the patio.  Would recommend highly.  As an added bonus, two MLB umpires arrived and gave my sons a ball used in one of the games today.  What a nice gesture."}
{"text":"I have only been here during happy hour.  But the food was good and the service was exceptional.  I also got to use a yelp deal.  I may try it again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Bartender was very friendly even after I had multiple coupons hahaha! 

My spicy margarita was perfect! Fish tacos were cute and rolled up and delicious! 

Will definitely be back with more friends! 

Thank you blue agave!"}
{"text":"I adore this place. The frozen margaritas are delicious and my boyfriend and I can split the steak burrito easily. The salsa is so delicious and the service is always friendly! I'm so glad I've discovered this place--makes it hard to try any other Mexican place around!"}
