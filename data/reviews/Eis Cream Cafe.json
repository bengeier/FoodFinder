{"text":"Such a great surprise. The closest thing I'd compare this to is the also-five-star-to-me Art of Flavors, which is up past the Stratosphere, where LV Blvd starts digging into the number streets. But Eis is down south in Green Valley, so it's a nicer part of town and easier and closer for me to get to.  So far have become a fan of both the strawberry & cream, and strawberry cheesecake. Both with real chunks and streaks of strawberry. Both delicious, and the finest strawberry ice creams I can remember having. We loved it enough to return twice in a week since we found this place! Their cronut-alike was also excellent and has set the bar for me to compare others to. We'll be coming back again and again."}
{"text":"The employees were incredibly kind and even offered me something that was not available at the counter. I wasn't incredibly impressed with the flavors and felt there was some ingredient that I just didn't like in many of them. Not to mention, many of the ones I tried were very rich and I love rich flavors but I wasn't crazy about any of the ice creams. Maybe better luck next time- also felt the scoops were bit over priced."}
{"text":"EIs Cream Cafe has ice cream that can't be beat! My wife and I tried out this local shop because of the reviews here on Yelp! and we were nothing short of impressed. Fresh ingredients, real cream, and creative flavors make for a spectacular shop. They have your normal flavors such as rocky road, coffee, and strawberry but then they have new and amazing combinations such as taro (purple yam or ube), coconut pineapple, and a marbled raspberry that was to die for. The girl behind the counter, Olive, is so friendly and helpful. Our first time in there, she spent ten minutes letting us sample the flavors and explaining about each one. The shop is adorable with hand painted and hand beaded ice cream decorations adorning the walls. They also sell pastries such as cronuts (which we plan to try one of these days) and their cookies they use for the sundaes look delicious. We've been several times and cannot wait to go again. In fact it's become our go-to ice cream shop because the quality of the ingredients is above and beyond those you'd find at a standard ice cream store. Do yourself a \"flavor\" and try out this wonderful local treat! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Nice little place. The coconut was great but the pineapple coconut was outstanding. Very refreshing on this hot Spring day!  Staff were very friendly and we are glad we decided to try the shop today."}
{"text":"Great new ice cream spot. They use fresh ingredients and the flavors pop with each taste. The prices are decent for one scoop."}
{"text":"This is a late post so shame on me.  I saw this place driving down Silverado Ranch Boulevard heading towards Eastern. If you're not paying attention you would miss it as it is in this strip mall alongside some forgettable shops. So forgettable I couldn't even tell you what they were. One day I read about it onYelp and intentionally paid it a visit. I was pleasantly surprised to find tropical/asian ice cream flavors such as Mango, Macapuno, Taro and Green Tea among traditional American flavors. I thought this was awesome because I wouldn't have to drive clear out to  Chinatown or central Vegas also known as Filipino land to get my fix.  Once there, I met Olive who gave me heaping scoops of my flavors of choice, Taro and Green Tea. They charge $4.50 for 2 scoops which I thought was fair after seeing what you got for it. They were delicious as expected. Perfect on a hot day. The shop was quaint and clean. Great for a dessert run for the family. They have a little corner in the shop that displays Sanrio merchandise.  They also sold some of the best kinds of cronuts you will taste. So next time you have an ice cream craving, go see Olive. She'll take care of you."}
{"text":"Our new favorite ice cream spot! With kronuts!!  Super friendly service, very clean place and very accommodating to our kids who wanted to sample all kinds of flavors.  And their recommendations were on point!  Happy customer who'll be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Friendly staff. Their ice cream was great, with a decent selection including macapuno and taro. The taro, particularly, was really good."}
{"text":"Super delish! Extremely friend! My favorite is the brownie sundae with strawberry cheesecake ice team!!"}
{"text":"Eis Cream Cafe had some of the friendliest employees and some of the most delicious homemade ice cream I've come across. Upon walking in, the first thing that you are bound to notice are the adorable decorations. There were desserts painted on the walls, a display full of trendy macarons and cronuts (!!!), a display of various candy, and even inflatable ice cream cones. I felt as though I walked onto the set of a Katy Perry music video! Haha :)  The ice cream was definitely the highlight. I want to say they have around 25 flavors, and they're all homemade! The bubbly employee behind the counter explained that they have \"real\" ingredients, such as mango from the Philippines in their mango ice cream, strawberries from California, and pineapple from Hawaii. They have a mixture of ice creams and sherbets, and I tried a good variety. I was a bit skeptical of the watermelon sherbet because it was an odd artificial magenta color, but it tasted like real watermelon, which was awesome. I ended up getting a scoop of the brownie ala mode, which is vanilla ice cream with fudge and brownies swirled in, and OMG. Heaven. They also have sundaes and ice cream sandwiches, but my ice cream was decadent enough.   This place is a hidden gem in the target plaza and is definitely worth checking out if you live in the area."}
{"text":"Love this quaint ice cream shop! Wonderful selection of ice creams, including seasonal options. The donut selection doesn't hurt either!"}
{"text":"This place is very cute, clean, and the lady whom I think is the owner is very friendly. Prices are reasonable too. Delicious."}
{"text":"We liked this cute ice cream shop! Coconut pineapple did not disappoint! Well priced and a big single scoop."}
{"text":"I have came here on multiple occasions and staff is very friendly and do not seem to rush you when you want to sample before making a choice. The place is clean and it's a cool place to sit and enjoy your ice cream without having to take it to go. The atmosphere is calm yet bright. I come at least once a week when I'm stepping out of my diet. :-)"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. I went there tonight and got a cronut sundae with the tin roof ice cream, which was so rich and satisfying. The women were so kind and were genuinely excited to work there and had just been featured on the Las Vegas Weekly, which they were so proud of. I felt welcomed and like I was actually part of their family there. We intend on coming back for their taro!"}
{"text":"Delicious, different, \"real\" ice cream. I had a banana split. Taro, pralines & cream, and pistachio. I had never had taro before, it was good, but probably a little too different for my palate. The praline Ice cream was amazing, reminded me of New Orleans, the pistachio was vibrant.  The owner was nice and welcoming, the treat was served on a silver tray which I thought was nice. My only complaint is that the banana was a bit overripe, which I found a bit overpowering, others might have liked it, but I have to rate for myself.  Imo, they probably need to fit one more table in here. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Yummy ice cream!!!  I have seen this ice cream shop from the street. This time my family and I stopped for ice cream.  Well, I have to say- it was really gooooooood!  The staff is friendly and the owner was SUPER sweet.    And, we will be back to get some yummy ice cream!!!   I'm thrilled it's so close to my house too, I can almost walk there!"}
{"text":"Who couldn't love a mom & pop ice cream shop, especially one that supports other local small businesses. Eis Cream Cafe features Al's Donuts kronuts (croissant donuts)! Anyway, as for their ice cream, burgundy cherry is killer! For my first visit I was in a chocolate mood and the cookies and cream hit the spot. My husband swears by the orange sherbet (he's lactose). Next time I'm looking forward to the coffee almond fudge and taro! The metal sampling spoons are an excellent touch."}
{"text":"A new ice cream place is always great to try. The Yelp reviews lead us to believe there was something amazing to be found! We did find that the service was great and the shop was decorated well and was clean. The ice cream and shakes that we ordered were yummy and satisfied. It would be best if more than just friends of the business gave their honest review."}
{"text":"This ice cream cafe is very cute, neat, and fresh! Their ice cream is also delicious. Their Taro flavored ice cream is said to be the most popular in their store, so I decided to get that...and it was delicious! They also sell macaroons (which I'll purchase next time). (:"}
{"text":"Cute Place...the flavors looked great but I did not try the ice cream :( The lady scooping the ice cream had her bare hands elbow deep in the ice cream container scooping out ice cream from the bottom. Un gloved hands all over the scooper and her entire arm was in the container and touching the ice cream. I was freaked out about how unhygienic that was that I had to leave without ordering."}
{"text":"Eis Cream Cafe is by far my favorite ice cream spot to go too. I'll be back, for there delicious banana nut and ube (purple yam) ice cream! Yummy yummy, in my tummy!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Vegas and love ice cream so we purchased a Groupon and had 3 vouchers. Our first visit was after a day of hiking and we fell in love with the homemade flavors they had to offer. The staff was incredibly friendly and let us taste as many flavors as we wanted to make sure we liked what we ordered. We went back the day we left and each ordered a sundae (one donut and one cookie...pictures are posted) and had an \"ice cream lunch\" prior to flying home later that night and couldn't have been happier. The portion size was HUGE! We felt very lucky that we stumbled on this Groupon and were able to enjoy new ice cream flavors over multiple nights of our stay. It would definitely be a place we'd frequent if we lived in the area!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here based on the Yelp reviews, husband declared this to be a \"great decision\".  Eis Cream Cafe is like the ice cream parlours from your childhood.  Everything is made with quality, in season ingedients, and it comes through in the flavors.  We both had the mango ice cream and it had chunks of mango that were so big, we had to cut them with our spoon.  The coconut pineapple was like a scoop of heaven, in a pretty glass ice cream dish.  They will offer you a taste of any of ice creams they have.  Not on those little plastic spoons that will sit in a landfill forever, but real spoons.  Silly to point out I know, but this was nice to me.  This is a family owned business thst makes you feel so welcome.  Stop by and show this great local business some support.  They are at the corner of Eastern & Silverado Ranch, facing out to Silverado Ranch.  You can't see it from Eastern, but you won't be sorry you took a few extra minutes to find it."}
{"text":"Alexis explained their story & was super sweet during the checkout. The prices are reasonable for the quality, & they have cool board games for fun dates!! We will be turning :)"}
{"text":"Eis Cream Cafe is just the best Ice cream place I've been to. I'm a regular here not only because they have the best ice cream, but they have the nicest, friendliest staff. Olive is just so wonderful and very accomodating. I've taken my friends here and they all said the same thing about Olive. Tanya is just as awesome.  I usually come here every week :)  Now let's talk about the sweets...they have a wide variety of flavors and they let you try because it's just really tough to decide which one to get.  My all time favorites are the Taro and Macapuno (young coconut). My next best picks are the Pineapple Coconut, Praline Caramel, Coffee Almond Fudge, and Chocolate.  They have kronuts too but I'm just really a big Ice cream person, so I go straight to the main event :)   I highly recommend this place if you are a picky ice cream person, you best come try Eis!!"}
{"text":"Really good ice cream made with real fruit. The floats are amazing and the staff is very friendly. It is hard to make a choice with so many good options!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Clean and they use fresh ingredients. Greeted with a friendly smile   and their Cronuts are delicious!"}
{"text":"Most unique ice cream flavors! The pine-nut is amazing. I've never had tequila ice cream before but it was refreshing and tasty. So glad to come back to find it under new ownership. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic ice cream - we split an ice cream sandwich - chocolate fantasy ice cream between 2 chocolate chip cookies. Nothing short of AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, probably the best ice cream I've ever had. I normally get the traditional kinds but after testing a few, was in love with their mango ice cream. The mangoes were imported from the Philippines and weren't artificial or frozen, but actual pieces of amazing fruit. I also would suggest the pumpkin and the mint chocolate one. They were also very friendly"}
{"text":"Great ice cream.  Great service by Olive. Will be my new ice cream place.  Glad I live across the street from this shop."}
{"text":"We love this place! It's by far the best ice cream and desert place!  You feel the warmth as soon as you walk through the door. All the flavors that we've tried are luscious! You can taste the fresh ingredients.  We get the 1.5 quart tubs to hold us over between visits!"}
{"text":"I love it! It's not every day that you can walk into an ice cream shop and find real ube ice cream. The Filipino ice creams are great!  You can really taste and actually find real ingredients in the ice creams. The lady on duty was super sweet and took the time to take care of us. She explained to us that the mango ice cream is made with mangos from Cebu. Those are the best kind! The decor is super cute and you can find a small selection of toys and gifts. We only tried the ice cream but other interesting items are on the menu that we'll have to come back to try! (Cronuts, macaroons, banana splits, etc.) Looking forward to our next visit! :)"}
{"text":"This place is very cute. I tried the green tea ice cream (made with real matcha) and the cookie dough ice cream (chunks of cookie dough!). Both were very good, but I decided on the lemon sorbet. The lemon sorbet was very light and refreshing. They make their ice creams and sorbets with fresh ingredients. We ate at the cafe and the lady put my sorbet in a fancy martini glass--much nicer than a styrofoam bowl!   We were sad that they were out of cronuts...apparently someone came in and bought out all of them earlier in the day. Next time!"}
{"text":"Such a cute ice cream shop! It has the very old fashion style to it. The ice cream was delicious! They had so many options to chose from as well. They also have brownies, kronuts-a croissant style doughnut and cookies. The staff is very nice and friendly. Clean and nice place!"}
{"text":"Silver plater service!!!! Try the cronut sundae!!!!!! So GOOOOD!!!!! Especially with someone special!"}
{"text":"A Great establishment with excellent customer service!   Las Vegas Strip quality ice cream without the crowds and trouble of going down to the strip.  The staff is friendly and willing to help out.  The ice cream is top quality and the flavors range from traditional to exotic.  It's worth the drive if you have that craving for some good, old fashioned ice cream.  I haven't tried the Kronuts(croissant-donuts) yet, but with Bread and Butter closing, this will the source for my craving."}
{"text":"EIS Cream Cafe!!! Love this cute little ice cream shop! Alexis and Olive are wonderful they make you feel welcome and right at home.    The ice cream is scooped in big servings and is not overpriced. On this trip we tried the coconut pineapple, cookies and cream, bubble gum, green tea, and a maple bacon kronut. Everything was great! Loved all the different flavors they have available. We will be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this hidden gem on the way to Vegas yesterday. Definitely will be back here again! I wished I asked the name of the lady serving us that day, but she was very friendly and welcoming. Here are a few comments:  The ice cream: Delectable! My boyfriend and I shared a sundae, not your ordinary one I may add. We got an original glazed raspberry filled cronut with a scoop of marble black raspberry and heath bar crunch topped with whipped cream and cherries. So yummy especially if it's 102° outside! We also bought a dozen macarons, for $15!!! Great price compared to buying macarons in Cali.   The place: It's so cute! The ice cream shop is very colorful, the walls are painted with ice cream. The vibrant colors and decor make it such an enjoyable place to hangout and eat ice cream.  I definitely recommend this place if your craving sweets!"}
{"text":"Delicious ice cream wonderful service so glad they're right next door!! I had the watermelon and peach cobbler"}
{"text":"I've been eyeballing this spot for a looong time Finally I went in because it was 900 degrees outside  When I got in there it looked like a preschool classroom  But don't be scared they serve adults too if you got little kids this is the joint  The ice cream here is absolutely amazing and I'm not Big on ice cream but if it's your thing you got to give this Place a day in court they got some crazy varieties like Banana Nut Taro Coconut Pistachio Burgundy Cherry Try any I vouch for all of them   Ok but the kicker is not the ice cream its Cronuts Yes I said it Cronuts they have different flavors  Like maple bacon chocolate nut and blueberry  So awesome ice cream and Cronuts  You can't lose its literally a WIN WIN  Also they have Macaroons"}
{"text":"This place is super cute:) I love walking in and feeling like a kid at an ice cream shop. The workers here are always friendly and it adds to the ice cream experience. They sell a bunch of nic nacs but i'm not interested in buying them, they are more for admiring and adding to the look of the place. They have Kornuts here! I'm not a fan of them, but my friends love them. Ice cream time! I love the fact that you can try a sample because there are way too many flavors to choose from. Mango is different from most places and my mom loves it, but I personally don't like it. LEMON SORBET IS MY FAVORITE!!!! I buy pitchers of this flavor every time I come. You can put it in your freezer at home and the soft texture will remain when you are ready to eat it. I've tried other flavors and I feel like they are lacking flavor a bit, but people still seem to enjoy them so it may just be me. I can't wait to come here with a group of people and get the big stuff like the sundaes with brownies and cookies and everything sweet haha. This place is right by my house and that may cause trouble for me cause I'll keep coming back! Don't forget you get 10% off you bill if you check in on yelp and there is also a groupon available!"}
{"text":"Nice little place. I'd been curious about it for a few months and got a coupon one day for 2 for 1. It was pretty quiet and the girl behind the counter was super friendly and helpful. We really liked the fun flavors and while they had a lot of traditional items, they had some unique ones and cool blends as well. Cute little shop and a great variety of items. Will definitely be back if I'm in the area!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Ice cream and other desserts are delicious. The service is always great. Gotta support small businesses with quality products!"}
{"text":"What a cute little ice cream parlor. I found it on yelp, thought I would try it out. I had the coconut (macapuno) & the purple ube (Filipino yam). My husband had the brownie sundae. They were all delicious! The coconut was my favorite. We'll definitely be back.  Excellent & friendly service, clean atmosphere, did I mention the ice cream was delicious. ;)"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious ice-cream. Especially the taro ice cream. The owner makes the ice-cream using fresh ingredients. It makes such a difference. Best ice-cream parlor!"}
{"text":"Under new management by Silverado la Florde Michicoacan. A fully Mexican ice cream experience from chamoy ice cream to elotes with the typical American flavors too. They do nit accept groupon"}
{"text":"Ice cream was fantastic! Service was very friendly and helpful. Can't recommend this cute little shop enough.   Try all the favors"}
{"text":"My favorite ice cream stop. All the classics made a little better with things like mint bits in the mint chocolate chip."}
{"text":"Super delicious! Love all the unique flavors. Cute decor like old fashioned ice cream shop. You can try as many flavors as you want to find the perfect choice. Disappointed they didn't have macarons for the ice cream sandwich. Will have to come back agsin"}
{"text":"My family checked this place out and we know definitely we'll be back!!! Can't really give 5 's yet as there are more flavors to try...cute place off of Silverado Ranch.   I sampled the pineapple coconut, ube, and the strawberry but enjoyed the macapuno!  Very creamy and coconut chunks!!!   The kids - cookie dough, cookies n' cream, strawberry cheesecake.  Try this place out - you'll enjoy it!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best ice cream places. Great and really tasty falvors! The only downfall is the high prices."}
{"text":"So much potential for this place. They have been only open for a few months so obviously there needs to be room for tweaking. But, it is what it is and I have to give an honest opinion.   The owners get their ice cream from Treat Ice cream company in San Jose. Treat has a ridiculous yelp rating over there. That means it should be 5 stars as well.. Not exactly.  Taste wise, only a couple flavors really put me away, the tin roof sundae and the taro. I forgot what was in the TRS, but there were a whole lot of goodies that went extremely well together. Let's talk about the taro, or as I like to call it, them taro ice cream... Probably the best taro ice cream I ever had! It was well balanced, smooth, and the taro flavor was very pronounced.  So what up wit da 3 stars u say?? Well, most of the ice creams that are served there are extremely icy! You can actually hear the crunch if you chew it. Not only does that distract from the flavor, but it is very unpleasant as well. I checked the reviews for Treat Ice Cream and they don't seem to have this problem. I don't know if this is due to the transportation of the ice cream or from the storage. But, all the flavors are really well balanced.. The texture is off.  The employees are nice and the store is well maintained. I would come back here just for the taro."}
{"text":"New place that opened up within the past month on the SE side of town, near No. 1 boba, on Silverado Ranch and Eastern. Shop FACES silverado ranch. Same \"building\" as No 1 boba.   I was told that the ice cream is from San Jose.   This is not your ordinary ice cream ! Taro has a slight texture where you can feel the \"grainy-ness\" of the root in the ice cream. Macapuno (young coconut) has actual pieces of young coconut (like what you'd get from inside a young coconut).   These two are my favorite. Not too sweet. Good flavoring.   Green tea was a little disappointing. Not too strong in green tea flavor (im a sucker for strong tea flavor hence why i like Cafe Teaze's teas)   Heath Bar Ice cream was good too ! nice to get some good sized bite pieces in the ice cream for you to be surprised by and enjoy :D   Cookies and cream is very well made. Cookies throughout and flavored nicely !   As i had mentioned in my tip, dont let the prices scare you. They are VERY generous in scoop sizes and you do get your money's worth !   Closes somewhat early (10pm) but when we went, everyone rushed near closing and created a line XD"}
{"text":"So fresh and good. I love the coconut pineapple! Super friendly too. Very cute Ice cream shop. My son loved the brownie Sunday. We will be back."}
{"text":"I've come here twice now and I enjoyed my ice cream both times.  The place has a good selection of ice cream, ranging from chocolate fantasy, heathbar crunch to native Filipino ice cream flavors lol purple yam (ube) and mango.   They do have other things such as cronuts, macarons and ice cream sandwiches (made with two cookies and ice cream in between), but I haven't gotten a chance to try it.  The service there is good. The first time I went was a better experience than the second. The second time I went with my family on a Friday night may have been overwhelming for the young girl who was working, but the vibe was a little off. It sort of felt like we were inconveniencing her with my order. Either way, I still got my order so it ends up okay.   I'd definitely check this place out and support a local business!"}
{"text":"This is the cutest little ice cream cafe i have ever seen! The lady who waited on us was nice and told us about how they use fresh ingredients in their ice cream. She also offered samples of the different kinds. The ice cream was good, I got the banana split my only complaint was she only put one topping on it white chocolate which confused me because she asked if i wanted fudge and i said i did. I would of said something while I was there but I didn't notice until I got home. You can tell the ice cream is top quality and the flavors do not taste artificial. I think they are a tad over priced for ice cream and the size of the place. I would recomend this place on quality of ice cream alone."}
{"text":"Awesome customer service and great tasting treats! My pregnant fiancé was having major cravings for this place. It was right at 8pm when we called to see when they close. She said that they close at 8pm. We live right across the street so she told us that she would wait to close until we got there. Needless to say, I have a satisfied pregnant woman next to me, which makes me a satisfied customer! They went above and beyond for us. Try the maple bacon cronuts!"}
{"text":"Eis Cream is filled with delicious creamy ice cream and two hot exotic filipino beauties. They have cute japanese ,eclectic pastries, and gourmet,homemade cronuts. GET THE BUBBLEGUM ICE CREAM BECAUSE its fucking bomb"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Eis Cream I had a sundae, which was delicious. The next time I had a sundae with a Cronut, not as good (personal opinion). All in all I do love this place. The employees have always been super nice and it just has that old ice cream parlour flair. My daughter is a huge Taro fan and she claims that this is the best in town. I'm just an all around ice cream connoisseur and I love it! You have to try it."}
{"text":"Stopped in since it's gotten hotter out & I was craving ice cream. Was really looking forward to an ice cream sandwich. Unfortunately they don't have sugar cookies. I don't like chocolate & all but one of the cookies they had had chocolate (regular or white) in it. They did have a oatmeal raisin but the size of that cookie was 1/2 as large as the chocolate chip cookies. Why would one buy the smaller oatmeal raisin cookie & pay the same price as someone ordering the much larger chocolate chip cookie. I was told they do make all their cookies in house & saw the oven. I would like to suggest they make sugar cookies to also go with the ice cream sandwiches. I might be back for that. Opted for 2 scoops of ice cream instead. It was OK but sadly I wasn't wowed."}
{"text":"Cute, small, ice cream place on Eastern and Silverado Ranch!  The few times I've been here were awesome! Great service and great ice cream!   I love ube (taro) anything so when I saw they had ube ice cream I was thrilled! Their ube ice cream is to die for! I've also tried their macapuno (young coconut) and green tea ice cream. All so creamy, fresh, and the flavor itself is not shy! Also, their scoops are ginormous, generous and almost overwhelming!   I've yet to try their cronuts, hopefully when they're freshly made.. And along with their other flavors of ice cream..  Don't be shy to ask for a sample! And you'll get 10% upon your Yelp check-in!"}
{"text":"The ice cream sold here is AwesomeLicious! Really! Their little shop is so cute too. Everyone I met on staff here is warm, friendly and encouraged me to try all the flavors they had. It made it so hard for me to decide what I wanted since I liked them all. They are off to a great start so far!  So here's the inside scoop:   -  It's a family operated biz run by Tanya and Alexis - The ice cream sold here is from Downtown San Jose's best kept secret..well except for here on Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz/treat-ice-cream-company-san-jose    The premium ice cream is the real deal. Real meaning no artificial flavorings or preservatives used to enhance the ice cream flavors.High quality ingredients are used to make their ice cream. Fresh fruit was even used for mango and peach ice cream that I tried. Only small batches are sold and when it is gone that's it!   Texture wise.real creamy it's super smooth, not icy/no crystallization.   The exotic flavors is what got me to check out this place. Taro and Macapuno. I tried several different flavors and ended up ordering these below:  Green Tea - has a bit more pop in flavor and is refreshing, perfect for the summer season.   Taro - made right from the taro root that they get from the Phillipines. Flavor is hard to describe. For me it's kind of nutty with vanilla tones.   Pineapple Coconut, Mango and the Peach flavors have strong fruit flavors.   Give Burgundy Cherry and Pistachio a try too.The flavors are \"wow  that's good!\" kinda good.   A one scoop sundae with toppings will set you back just under five bucks. It might seem a little high for the BR/Thrifty crowd. And why it falls short of five stars overall, but those seeking premium, higher quality ingredients in an ice cream will appreciate what they carry.. Ice cream alone is undoubtedly five stars. I'm just ecstatic they have Taro!   There is also cold case that has dessert cakes and 'Kronuts'. Hmmm Kronut Ala Mode anyone?   Shout out and credit goes to my new Yelper friend Melissa V.!  She checked in on her Yelp app and put it out on blast they carried Filipino flavors! So don't forget to check in on your Yelp app! You get 10% off.  I mentioned the shop is super cute. Ice cream parlourish theme. Hand painted artwork, striped walls in the hallway. The furnishings are cleverly re purposed. All done by co-owner Tanya!   FYI: I missed seeing this place since the trees obscure the view on Eastern Ave. Location is in the same complex that has Windy City Beef, Las Cazuelas, No 1 Boba Tea, just right around the corner from Yummy Sushi. Eis Cream Cafe faces Silverado  ...yeah I KNOW that corner of the Target shopping center just got a little more fattening!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience! My first visit was memorable so I returned with my daughter.   Unfortunately we arrived right at closing time.  To my surprise they kept the store open and provided a champions level of service.  We delighted in tasting everything.  My new favorite is the chocolate chip and my teen settled for the cheesecake.  Neither of the delicious treats made it out of the parking lot.    It is nice having such a wonderful new family business in our back yards...somewhat reminiscent of the Bay Area.  It's a little difficult to find but worth the search.  Once exposed you will be hooked like us!  Good luck ladies!   Welcome to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We love this place. The owner is really nice and always has good suggestions. it's like our \" cheers\", but for ice cream. So many flavors and varieties, you can't go wrong. :)"}
{"text":"#1 you could smell this place 5 blocks away. The smell of this place was absolutely sensational! I have been wanting to come here and I finally got a chance to try it and I am not disappointed. Brother got Taro and I got Matcha Green Tea ice cream. The lady who served us was so nice and sweet. She was telling us about the different flavors and different kinds of pastries they carry here. The cronut looked absolutely delicious if I was craving it I'd buy them! Definitely will be back here! Same prices as thriftys but the flavor selections waaaaaay better. :) I hope this place stays for a long time!!!!"}
{"text":"The bakery is absolutely adorable! The staff was extremely kind and helpful with our requests. They went above and beyond to make our first experience great. You can definitely tell they really do care about their customers. I will be coming back here every time I visit Las Vegas and want a macaron."}
{"text":"The ice cream is so good here  and they have cronuts which are so delicious and hard to find in vegas. They are always friendly as well. Hope this place succeeds, we need more mom and pop specialty food places like this in vegas"}
{"text":"We came for ice cream at 8:30 on a friday. Door says they close at 9pm. But you'd never know from the shut off sign, locked doors and lack of any visible employees.  Not impressed. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I've never tasted such quality ice cream :) I had the kronut Sunday and it was full of flavor! Every ingredient was quite delectable :) as for decorations, it's the perfect little ice cream shop. Everything is bright and colorful. It puts you in the eis cream mood :D I loooooove it!"}
{"text":"best ice cream i have ever had!! cutest ice cream shop in the world.!! come visit ! its so yummy and kawaii!!!!!!! ahhh!!!"}
{"text":"Really good ice cream!  We are so glad we found this little mom and pop ice cream shop.  I highly recommend the Chocolate Fantasy for all you chocolate lovers."}
{"text":"A nice little ice cream spot off Eastern and Silverado Ranch, tucked behind the other side of the same building where Nothing Bundt Cakes is located.  I was greeted with a smile and a wonderful visual array of ice cream deliciousness.  After sampling a few flavors, I decided on the Pistachio Ice Cream sandwich which was yummy.  A great spot to chill after dinner."}
{"text":"The first time I came here I wanted a Halo Halo. The server told me that they ran out of ice and could not make a Halo Halo. I ended up getting the Macapuno and Ube ice cream and it was DA BOMB. I came back 2 days later and brought my cousins with me. The kids ordered shaved ice which was supposed to come with mochi and condensed milk, this time they ran out of mochi.  Service was great I just didn't like the fact that when I come here there's always something missing. I'm a \"three strikes your out\" kinda person. I'll be back and hopefully I can order something without having to hear an ingredient is missing."}
{"text":"I think what happened is that the name and management changed. There is still an ice cream shop here but now it is Silverado Flor de Michoacan.  They have amazing ice cream, all sorts of unique flavors. I say unique for anyone who wasn't raised eating Mexican ice cream flavors like Guava, Rose and Chongos zamoranos.  I also love her aguas...juices? My favorite is the Agua de Mamay while my boyfriend who is not Hispanic really likes the milk based Strawberry...This is a difficult review to write because I feel like I need to explain as I rave. The prices are great and the owner is a very friendly lady who makes you feel like you're visiting a sweet, talkative aunt."}
{"text":"The staff is super friendly and they have a great selection of fresh made ice cream and other sweet treats. I love supporting small business and this place deserves all the love they get! You can sample as many flavors as you want and mix and match flavors. The bubblegum is always my favorite and is honestly as good, if not better, then Ben & Jerry's. Great summer treat!"}
{"text":"This place is our favorite locally owned ice cream shop. Hubby and I have had shakes, ice cream sandwiches, and tonight had the Halo Halo. First time trying it and it was awesome. Great flavors and textures. We always have great service though there is usually only one person working. She is really nice!  The flavors of ice cream are just perfect. Not too sweet, but sweet enough. My favorite is the young coconut and the taro."}
{"text":"Best ice cream! My husband can't drive passed this place without stopping and getting himself at least one scoop. My husband and I moved to the Silverado ranch area about a year ago. Ice cream is our weakness so we have tried multiple different ice cream places around and this place is by far, the best..plus the lady that works there is awesome! You must try it!"}
{"text":"Their ice cream is soooo delicious! I love small business because you can tell how much pride and heart they put into their business. You can taste the quality in all their flavors they have to offer. They just opened 2 days ago, so not too much traffic yet but soon they will because you can't find an ice cream parlor quite like this place.  They offer flavors that will be hard to find else where such as ube, coconut pineapple just to name a few. They also have cronuts, donuts, and slices of cake to top off your sweet tooth.   50% of what makes a business successful is service and this place has that with the warm hospitality and friendliness. We walked in there and was greeted immediately with a smile. They also let us sample the flavors but by then I had a hard time deciding because EVERY THING was GOOD. I ended up getting the Taro/Ube.The best I've ever tried and I've tried alot of brands.  This place is a lil bit hard to find because they don't have a sign up yet... it's facing Silverado ... it's next to a vacuum shop and nail salon. ...  Definitely you must try this place..."}
{"text":"First timers here and I am very impressed. My boyfriend I enjoyed  that we got to sample some of the different  ice cream flavors we were interested in. Olive, who  helped us was so sweet and nice. So my boyfriend ended up getting the Ube&Macapuno and I ended up having the mango&green tea which all flavors were so flavorful and delicious. We also ended up getting the maple bacon cronut,omg yum!"}
{"text":"We were craving ice cream for dessert and found Eis Cream Cafe through Yelp. So glad we tried it! The ice cream was delicious - we had a hard time choosing which flavor to get because they all looked good. The cherry and banana nut were awesome. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"FREE WIFI!!! Great service. Great quality products and very affordable prices!! Ube never disappoints. Macapuno goes very well with it!!"}
{"text":"A couple days ago, my friends and I made our way to Henderson to buy a friend some bundt cakes... Then ate sushi... Then saw a an EIS cream sign right outside. The sign triggered my memory and I knew I had bookmarked the place and had been wanting to try it out, but just never knew where it was. In other words, IT WAS MEANT TO BE!   My friends and I walked into such a beautifully lit and decorated ice cream shop- it was definitely a CHILD'S DREAM, as well as 3 ADULTS' DREAM. lol. Upon walking in, we were greeted by a nice lady. She offered us samples of any we wanted to try, and I was not disappointed once! The ice cream was perfect and there are various flavors to choose from, good for the entire family!!  We got the mini ice cream cone sampler, which comes with 9 mini cones all for $10! An ice cream addict's dream come true!   In addition to all the fun ice cream flavors, there are various toys on sale as well. There were Hello Kitty gift packs, erasers, stuffed animals, etc. You gotta get the the ice cream pillow/stuffed animal!! I wish I did!  Before I ramble about everything else, I'll leave you with this... Summer time is coming, so what better way to enjoy the summer with an ice cream cone or cones?!!! Support this local gem!! :)"}
{"text":"Yum yum!!  Best ice cream spot in town!!!  They were out of taro so didn't get to try it but everything else was amazing. Had a kronut sundae    Best I have ever had. Definitely will go back and support this local small business"}
{"text":"Wow, A+ ice cream. Really fresh ingredients and call me crazy but ice cream tastes better with a metal spoon. I plan to frequent this place. If you've never tried TARO ice cream get in there and try it before its out of season."}
{"text":"Best ice cream in Las Vegas!!  It's super creamy, and made with fresh fruits from places as far away as the Philippines and Hawaii!  Taro and the coffee were my favorites.   I've been there twice already and they just opened about a week ago.   The owners and employees are super friendly.  It's a very cute and yummy place to enjoy great quality ice cream :)"}
{"text":"Excellent ice cream and great vibe! The peanut butter cup ice cream was fantastic! Plenty of parking and great service. Will go back. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went there and finally tried them. Nothing really stood out for me. Sister had cookie sundae and the cookie was so hard I almost bent the medal spoon trying to take a bite, even when the ice cream melted on top. Ice cream and customer service was good. Probably won't be back though. I'll just drive a little further to get softer cookies with ice cream."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. The ice cream was not very good. No different really than getting it in the grocery store. The menu is small and hard to read. Very limited/basic. The decor is pretty uninspired and the ambiance flat. There just is no reason to go back. I would've love to see this place bring in more fresh ingredients and really set itself apart as a modern ice cream shop. Honestly I would rather go to the chain of Coldstone versus this place."}
{"text":"I rarely eat ice cream but after a hot day at a pool we stopped in and got the ice cream sampler - it's 9 tiny cones of all different flavors. Amazing. The sherbets are my fave,  but they're all great. You can tell they use high quality ingredients. The owner, Tanya, was super friendly and helpful. We also tried one of the mini-kronuts and thought it was great. Will be back."}
{"text":"I have to start off saying that the people that run this place?? Nicest ever.  Being greeted when you walk into an establishment is excellent, especially when its genuine, like they really want to get to know you.  That hooked me in tremendously.  Now for the goodies.  Very unique flavors...which are super strong and delicious.  I was blown away from just the tasting process.  I didn't expect to go in there and see a flavor entitled Taro.  I was like what?? Isn't that some kind of tuber or something? So I'm adventurous... said lets do this!!! Couldn't believe it...soooooo good! It had a soft hint of vanilla and a perfect texture.  Just what I needed to end a stressful day.  It was so good that I couldn't get it out of my mind, so the next night?? I was right back in there.  This time I decided to try the Smashing Pumpkin. I was standing there in awe.  The flavor is out of this world!! Strong hints of pumpkin and nutmeg.  I didn't want the scoop to end. Please go and try this!!!  The prices are fair, the flavors are amazing, and the shop is a small cute spot.  They will know me by name pretty soon."}
{"text":"simply amazing. It was my first time here today. Very friendly staff, yummy ice cream flavors... oh and the kronuts.... ooohhh lala. A definite must-try and must-come-back."}
{"text":"Wow! The best ice cream I've had living in Las Vegas. It is a locally owned store and the owners are nice.  Tried Pumpkin ice cream - amazing. Tastes very fresh. The strawberries and cream was amazing too. Everything is freshly made and they only use in season fruit!"}
{"text":"My family and I went here because we like to support small local business owners. We went here when it was the shaved ice place before this. We were sad when it closed. But after coming to Eis, we had a change of mind! The owner is the sweetest lady ever. She remembered us from the first time we were in there.Her kids were in there this time, and its so nice be see a family run business. Her ice cream is just as amazing as her customer service. Its rich and delicious.The décor is great. She even puts crafts on the table for the kiddies to make. We love it. Its a great addition to Vegas. Love the location too. Right by our house!  Prices are comparable to Cold Stone, but you will have a positive \"home like\" feeling at Eis. Our three kids give it 2 thumbs up, and would give it higher if we could. :) Definitely check it out!   One suggestion, add a chunky chocolate peanut butter flavor to the menu. That's the one flavor that draws me to Cold Stone every now and again :("}
{"text":"This quaint little shop on the southwest corner of Eastern and Silverado Ranch is delightful. The ice cream is procured from a small creamery using quality ingredients which is evident with your first bite! They offer free tastes on metal spoons (nice touch!) and servings are plentiful. The shop is bright, clean and inviting. I highly recommend an afternoon delight or after dinner treat at Eis Cream!"}
{"text":"Cute, clean, awesome service and yummy!  Don't miss this little shop!  Store offers ice cream, sundaes, and bakery items.  Be sure to check for the value pack coupon before you go.  It's hidden in the corner of the shopping center by target near the vacuum store.  The lady behind the counter even served our ice cream in a glass bowl since we were eating in the store."}
{"text":"First off, great Customer service. The lady helping us was telling us how the ice is made and where the ingredients come from. Also, she let us try some samples. For the price of $4.50 of two scoops, she loaded the cone with ice cream. We weren't expecting so much but we couldn't complain. Who can when you get a lot of ice cream. Check out my pic, it will show you. We got the watermelon sorbet, twas awesome, and the mint cookie krunch, was also good. Their cronuts. ...yes been looking for the perfect texture of what I thought a cronut should feel like. Other places have cronuts that are too flaky and don't have a donut feel to it at all except for the shape. These had both. Flaky and thick and they weren't oily.  I had the bacon maple one and I did a review where I thought that a maple bar and custard filling did not work, but I think the bacon made a difference because it wasn't just sweet, but salty cause of it. It was that good that I killed it and had to think twice about sharing it.  Awesome ice cream, awesome cronuts, overall great place. Will be back. Fo'sho."}
{"text":"Came here with my daughter, tried the pumpkin and taro and it was so onolicious!  I recommend anyone to come here.  And they also have French Macaroons and Hawiian Shave Ice! Lei D."}
{"text":"Great Service !  Great Ice Cream ! Great Atmosphere!  I would highly recommend this ice cream shop.  It is hard to find great ice cream shops here in LV - this would rank very high on my list !"}
{"text":"Best tasting ice cream -- I had the taro flavor, my daughter had the brownie and my son had the strawberry -- the ice cream were delicious!!!! Also, got to meet the owners and they were so nice:-)!"}
{"text":"Such a cute ice cream spot! She was super sweet and the ice cream was great! I had mango and my fiancé had ube (taro) and macapuno (young coconut). She told us the ingredients were fresh from the Philippines and they make everything in house! The mango also had fresh chunks of mango in it! Yum! You can definitely taste how fresh everythig was! They also have cronuts and macarons. It's a bit of a hidden gem, but we will be back!"}
{"text":"Finally got around to trying this Eis Cream Parlor that I saw on yelp a few weeks ago while searching for cronuts.   I was intrigued by the fact they offer ube ice cream.   After having an epic cheat meal at Grimaldi's with my brother, we decided to check this place out and so satisfied that we did.  We walked in a few minutes before closing and was welcomed by Olive.  She was more than helpful to let us try samples of the flavors offered and went above and beyond to explain their ingredients and where they come from.   I kid you not, I wanted a scoop of all the flavors.   I've never experienced flavors and all natural ice cream textures until now.  You can really tell the difference between home made & all natural compared to mass produced/commercialized  ice cream that seems to plague the market.   If you're ready for a game changer, get your behind in here and treat yourself. In conclusion, the staff here is warm, friendly and informative.  The ice cream is the best I have ever tasted in my 31 years of existence.  They have a passion for their business and will treat you like family. I will definitely come back because the ice cream is unmatched and I forgot to try the cronuts."}
{"text":"Eis Cream Cafe is a wonderful addition to the ice cream options available in the Las Vegas area. We were greeted by the friendly owners as soon as we came in and they offered samples of their many interesting flavors including strawberry cheesecake, ube, pineapple, tin roof sundae, and my favorite by far was the Taro! The flavors were fresh and perfectly creamy. This shop is just what this neighborhood needed!"}
{"text":"Received a coupon in the val pak and was surprised they had opened.  Called in advance to see if they were open tonight (4th of july) and they were!  Cute place, would have never known they were there because they face silverado blvd I usually come in from the eastern side.  Ladies working were very friendly  Ice cream was tasty, prices are inline with every other commercial ice cream store in the area. Def will be back"}
{"text":"I read the other Yelp reviews and I get it. Why pay so much for a small scoop but really it's a small price to pay for a high quality scoop of heaven!!  I was over the moon excited when I read there was a place here in Las Vegas that sold Treat Ice Cream. I was introduced to this by my San Francisco cousin who purchased the Lunardis Mango Ice Cream who we researched and found out was really made by Treat from San Jose.   My favorite is the mango ice cream. It's like eating the most flavorful fresh mango with each spoonful. It's really an amazing product. Now with this shop close by I fully intend to return to try all the flavors.   The staff was very friendly and the shop is too cute I just wish they were in a better location so they would get more traffic coming in and out because they need to stick around a long time to give me my mango ice cream fix!    I purchased a $12 tub for home but need to finish it soon so I can return!"}
{"text":"Great ship ! Very kid friendly! Large menu! They have cronies! The ice cream was simply a delight!"}
{"text":"OMG sooooooo delicious!!! Honestly the best creamy ice cream I've ever had!!!!! I had the taro ice cream and it blew my mind. I also purchased a \"cinnamon kronut \"  wOW !!!!!!!!!!Wonderful customer  service the girl there was incredibly sweet! I WILL be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Great selection of tropical and traditional ice cream flavors. Tastes fresh, natural and not too sweet. Got a few fresh baked cookies to add to our dessert. Delicious dessert, friendly service and cute candy land decor makes it a great place for dessert."}
{"text":"You can get any shake flavor from real ice cream! That's my favorite option when im in a rush but need a little sugar high. Great costumer service as well!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute and the staff is very friendly! Tasty HOMEMADE flavors with real ingredients. If you're looking for a unique local ice cream shop in Henderson, this is the place to go! Flavors include young coconut, cherry burgundy, purple yam (taro and ube) and much more! :)"}
{"text":"I like to support local businesses.  This place just opened about a year ago.  I tried the banana nut ice cream, a cronut, and the macadamia nut cookie ice cream sandwich.  Ice cream: So I glanced at their business website and read that they use real ingredients and fresh fruits such as hand picked strawberries, and chocolate, coconut, and mango flown in from the Phillipines.  Just looking at the texture of my banana nut ice cream, it does taste like it has natural ingredients.  I'm normally not an ice cream kind of person, but I thoroughly enjoyed my banana nut ice cream.    Cronut:  I tried the maple nut cronut and thought it was too sweet.  Not bad though.  The sugar was just a little much.  Macarons:  I had the macarons the first time I came here last year.  That was when I was on a macaron binge and I was searching for the best macarons in town.  Anyways, I'm a little sad that you can't get the macarons in individual pieces.  You have to buy them by the package.    Ice Cream Sandwich: This was amazing.  Freshly baked macadamia nut cookies with vanilla ice cream filling.    I would go back here for the banana nut ice cream and ice cream sandwich again.  yummy yum yum"}
{"text":"A pleasant place to get your ice cream fix. Very friendly & helpful ladies who run the place. I recommend their Macapuno & Mango ice creams!"}
{"text":"It's a hidden gem in town! Ice cream is on point! The place is clean and colorful. The owner and the staff are very kind and friendly. Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"All the ice cream was freshly made.   Ice creams: -Macapuno -Ube -Coconut Pineapple -Coffee Almond Fudge  Must try the Macapuno and Ube ice cream. The macapuno had a really fresh tasting coconut to it, not overly sweet. The Ube wasn't as starchy as the magnolia brand. Excellent taste!   Service Amazing! The girl over the counter was very helpful in our choices."}
{"text":"Great little ice cream shop in the corner mall area. You can taste the fresh and natural ingredients. Tanya, the owner, was very nice and very helpful. I would recommend anyone in the area to give this cute and charming ice cream parlour a try.    My son loved the a watermelon sorbet. I also found that the pralines and cream was very creamy and naturally sweet."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like small, locally-owned business? I'm happy to support them as long as their product is good.  Eis Cream Cafe, located in the same strip mall as Las Cazuelas, Target, and Freed's, doesn't make many of their items in-house, but when you want to satisfy your sweet tooth, that doesn't always matter.   Ice cream, imported from a shop in Northern California, is their main draw, but they have brownies, cookies, and pastries available as well. You can combine items like ice cream and a cronut (made by Al's Donuts) to make a Kro-nut sundae ($7.95). Cut into pieces, then topped with mint chocolate chip ice cream, chocolate sauce and chocolate sprinkles, it's large enough to share. The ice cream was thick and creamy and full of chunks of chocolate. The cronut, however, didn't hold up well and quickly became soggy. It was a good idea, but you're better off sticking with a brownie if you're craving a sundae."}
{"text":"Some of the best ice cream in Vegas! Wow! It's so refreshing to taste such real flavors!  They are so yummy and all had such incredible flavor. Taro/purple yam and young coconut were incredible!!! The banana walnut ice cream tastes like just like real banana no imitation flavor. We loved every flavor we tried! It's a cute little place. We will be back."}
{"text":"I tried this place out earlier this month. I got a scoop of taro ice cream and a scoop of strawberry cheesecake. Both flavors were so creamy and fresh tasting. The strawberry cheesecake ice cream had strawberry chunks in it as well, which I loved. One scoop was more like 2 scoops, so the price was definitely worth it. The owner is genuinely super nice and friendly. She offered samples for any flavor I wanted to try too. I really do hope this small business does very well because I would be so sad if they closed down! I can't wait to go back. :)"}
{"text":"I am so happy a delicious and family owned ice cream shop came to my neighborhood! The ice cream is a amazing and a cronut?!!! BONUS!"}
{"text":"Delicious tasting homemade ice cream the staff is really lovely I would highly recommend going to this place can't wait to go back.  Do not miss this ice cream shop it's a real treat oh and by the way they also have homemade Chronuts.  it's to die for."}
{"text":"Sorry fellow yelpers but I'm gonna have to disagree with all the 4 and 5 stars on this place. First off ice cream is way too sweet , I sampled the butter pecan and  peach cobbler and couldn't help but taste all the sugar. Don't get me wrong I love sweets and deserts but this had too much sugar. The peach cobbler had more peaches than actual ice cream. I hate to write negative reviews in general but I'm sorry eis cream I won't be back. I star for decor I star for service."}
{"text":"We went on a day that was't too busy, but we were greeted by a nice young woman who treated us extremely well. She explained that all of their ice cream is made with fresh ingredients and directed me towards the kronut sundae. Then, I asked if they were usually not busy and she explained that during the winter they're not too popular. After telling the lady that I'd bring my friends there, she was elated. I definitely recommend this place. Cool, local flavors and great service."}
{"text":"Locally owned, awesome ice cream, awesome staff....and the girl that helped me was insanely beautiful.  Taro ice cream!  Cronut ice cream sandwiches!!!  Give this place your business, they deserve it."}
{"text":"Great local ice cream and desert place. You should come here craving ice cream and you will leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Best EIS cream ever!! Don't believe? Come try for yourself!! MMMMM!    If you live or just visiting Vegas, this should be your first destination to go to! If you're not here, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"The macapuno is a must try for pistachio and coconut lovers! It's a nice sweet and creamy ice cream. The scoops are VERY generous and the decor in the restaurant is just adorable. The owners are also quite friendly. Would definitely recommend eating here. Fair prices too. Will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Omg I am in Vanilla Eis Cream Heaven! It really is to die for. Absolutely delicious and not too sweet. If you like Coconut then you should try their Macapuno (young Coconut) which is also very tasty. I will go back thats for sure."}
{"text":"Eis Cream (pronounced ice cream), is a family run ice cream parlor & sweets shop owned and operated by Alexis Gonzaga.  Eis Cream is located in the Target shopping center on Eastern, in a strip that faces Silverado Ranch.  This charming shop carries a wide selection of ice cream flavors, sherbets, and sorbets imported from Treat Ice Cream Company of San Jose, California.  They also carry baked goods like cookies, brownies, and Kronuts; and have a few 4-top tables as well as a table with board games and Jenga.  We sampled a few flavors and settled on a couple of waffle cones.  One filled with the flavor of the month, Chocolate Fantasy and Butter Pecan and the other with Strawberry cheesecake and Burgundy Cherry.  All 4 flavors were rich, creamy, and very tasty.  We didn't choose the most complex or modern flavors, but sometimes you just want to kick it old skool.  Side note, they have a 10% Yelp discount."}
{"text":"Awesome selections of ice cream! And absolutely delicious!! I has the strawberries and cream (with real strawberries) and he chocolate! The chocolate is made with shaved dark chocolate and super rich!! Outstanding service and ice creams!!!!! You must go here!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ice cream was great! Service was wonderful! She was really nice! Cute little place to take the kids!"}
{"text":"Eis Cream Cafe is a super cute and delicious ice cream shop. I was leaving Yummy's sushi with my boyfriend when we saw a sign for the Eis Cream Cafe and knowing us ice cream lovers, we had to see what this place was all about. We went in & my first thoughts were on how creative the decor was. The walls were painted, the tables & chairs were white, and the ice cream was to the left. The staff were very friendly and were patient with all the different flavors we wanted to try. I ended up choosing a scoop of the taro ice cream (which was to die for) in a cone & my boyfriend had an ice cream sandwich. The way they served our samples was what caught my eye. Instead of using little plastic spoons, they gave us our samples on real miniature spoons which gave us a good portion to try. Not only do they have ice cream, but they also have cake slices & cronuts!! Unfortunately, I was unable to try the cronuts or cake slices but I will definitely be going back soon to order one or two. Overall, Eis Cream Cafe is unique, delicious & staff friendly. It's hard to find a decent ice cream shop outside of the usual over priced cold stone creamery or baskin robbins. My boyfriend & I were extremely happy to stumble upon the Eis Cream Cafe. We will definitely become regular customers."}
{"text":"They're really kind when it comes to trying as much ice cream flavors as you want unlike other ice cream shops.   The interior of the place is adorable. White chairs and tables with light colored walls. The place is designed as if it's the inside of a cute house.   Ice cream is great! I really like how one single scoop looks like 2-3 scoops of ice cream. I tried the taro, cherry, and strawberry cheesecake. The strawberry cheesecake is phenomenal!! You must try it!!!   Free wifi too if you ask for the pw."}
{"text":"Great hidden ice cream shop!!! It was 300degrees Fahrenheit outside today and this hit the spot! Quality ingredients from California farms. A Friendly staff member from the Midwest was very helpful and knowledgable with the product  This place is a must try for the ice cream lovers!!!"}
{"text":"If you want a yummy banana split this place is where you should go! I loved my banana split it was Huge!! And the lady that works there is very nice and friendly"}
{"text":"Locally-owned gourmet ice cream shop in my 'hood? I want to give it 5 stars already!! Good thing I actually checked it out first....as much as I want to love Eis, it's just not that great. The selection of flavors looked awesome, but after sampling about 6 of them, they just failed to live up to my expectations. I finally settled on strawberry cheesecake for my daughter who wanted pink, and pecan praline for me, because it's always my fave. The praline was very good, but the cheesecake was not. The strawberry ribbons were gooey and super-sweet, just like the stuff that comes in the cheap ice cream at the grocery store.  Unfortunately, Yogurtland and Nielsen's still get my vote in this area."}
{"text":"Cronuts, Macarons, Tiramisu, and Ice Cream...All in One Cafe? Yessir!  This Adorable Cafe is Located in Silverado Ranch, Right on the Corner of Eastern & Silverado Ranch!   There isn't too much seating, but You can Always get it To Go! =)  Prices are Clearly Marked on the Wall Close to the Register, Everything is kept Nice, Clean, and Spotless!   If this is your First Time here, like I was....The Very Friendly Counter person is More than Willing to Help you with Any Questions you May have! They also give you samples of the Naturally Made Ice Cream they Serve! And, the Ice Cream is Delicious, no wait....Amazing! I was in Heaven...I had the Pineapple Coconut, and This One, Compared to Others was Outstanding! You just have to go and try it for yourself! You May Think Otherwise, But this Is My Opinion!   They have a Menu Ranging from a Banana Split, to a Brownie Sundae, Cronut Sundae, and they also have a Few Items where you can Share with Others! I was gonna take a Pic of the Menu, but I was Just too Happy with My Cronuts! lol If you are looking for Just a Scoop of Ice Cream & Looking for the Price? its on the Counter where the Ice Cream is...Next to the Waffle Cones! =)  Prices are Very Reasonable, Free Complimentary Water for those Eating in the Cafe, the Workers there are a Delight!   I Will be Back...I Think I have Found My New Addiction! =) Happy Yelping Y'all!  Until Next Time....Hasta la Vista, Baby!"}
{"text":"Word to the Wise: Every time I passed by Eis Cream, I would say, \"Ooh, there's E's Ice Cream!\" In reality, it is pronounced ICE-cream.   Anyways, about the actual ICE CREAM: I came in with the intention of eating their popular Taro ice cream in a waffle cone. In reality I shared a banana split with my friend, and we ended up getting Raspberry Truffle, Marble Fudge, and Strawberry. Price-wise it was just more practical-- one scoop is $3.25, a banana split comes with three scoops and is $7.50. I sampled their Taro ice cream and ended up just not being in the mood; although I must say it was very authentic! Mango (which I tried from my other friend) was also very authentic and fresh.   Service: The service was alright, only one person was available so with five customers it was kind of slow. Unfortunately their swiped for credit cards was broken when I visited, and I heard the lady mutter that it has been happening a lot lately. If you come here, bring cash just in case. I was lucky to have just enough.   Overall: I give Eis Cream 3 stars for the slow service but generous scoops, 4 for variety of flavors. The decor is adorable and very sweet-shop-like, which helped with my rating as well. I'd like to come back to try their halo-halo and cronut, but if I were to get ice cream I would come with family or friends to make the most out of my money and get the banana split."}
{"text":"Pineapple coconut. Taro. Mango. Green tea. Banana nut. I could go on and on. These were just some of the flavors I sampled and they were insanely good. You can seriously taste how natural the flavors were, especially without all the artifical flavors and additives. I really appreciated how informative the lady was with all the questions we had. We ended up leaving with a quart of the pineapple coconut. I will be back to try their cronuts."}
{"text":"The ice cream is great and really creamy. The service is wonderful and they're so friendly. I love this place! Came from Los Angeles and will definitely come back here whenever I'm in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Ice cream made with fresh fruit and no preservatives? You can taste the difference. Eis is amazing! They have tons of fun flavors and lots of options besides ice cream. My favorites are the marble black raspberry and banana walnut, but no need to trust my review- the owners will offer plenty of samples!  The two of us ordered the large ice cream cookie sandwich and a regular scoop of ice cream (we couldn't decide on just one flavor haha). The scoops are huge! The large cookie sandwich had two huge cookies and 4+ scoops of ice cream? That alone was enough for two people. The ice cream is creamy, just the way it should be. They have sherbert as well! However, I didn't see any fat free flavors.  The shop has board games to play in store and small toys on sale.  My only complaint is that the cookies were a little flakey and not as soft as I would have hoped. However the amazing-ness of the ice cream made up for it. I'm still giving 5/5 stars.  I wish Eis wasn't so close to my gym! I will definitely be rewarding myself with some more ice cream again soon :)"}
{"text":"Adorable old fashioned homemade ice cream shoppe! Must try the banana nut flavor, tasted just like a muffin!! The decor looks like a Pinterest board come to life! Prices were very reasonable especially since 1 scoop is actually closer to 3. Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, but definitely not my last. Walking in, you could tell the atmosphere is a fun ice cream shop. My sister suggested dessert after dinner so i was excited to try this place. They offered plenty options such as banana nut, peach cobbler, basic ice cream flavors and some exciting flavors. I chose ube and butter pecan. It was so hard to choose so i had to get 2 different scoop cups. The butter pecan was creamy and soothing to the taste buds. I'm pretty used to magnolia's ube ice cream, so I was a bit surprised by the taste. The ube was light and not as creamy as my pecan was. Especially it being homemade, it still fulfilled my Filipino dessert cravings. Definitely going to buy the groupon to get my moneys worth."}
{"text":"I really want to find a good local ice cream shop in Vegas, but so far this hasn't happened. I thought Eis would be the winner and I've had it bookmarked to visit for awhile.  We arrived as soon as they opened on Sunday (2 PM) and were promptly greeted and offered samples. I loved the taste of the Green Tea flavor and the Pistachio. The shop is really cute inside and they even have board games for those that want to hang out awhile.  My husband ordered his ice cream. It took some time for the ice cream to be scooped, but not a ridiculous amount of time. Then the woman helping us didn't return immediately. We waited and waited. By the time she returned my husband was completely finished with his scoop. I was actually ready to drop a $5 on the counter and leave by this point, but my husband said he wanted to see if they could redeem themselves.  I order my ice cream and request the cake cone with sprinkles. She disappears for awhile to scoop my ice cream and returns with my ice cream in the wrong cone. I normally just overlook things like this, but after the long wait my husband insists I ask for the correct cone. Finally it returns in the right cone. My ice cream and cone were good at first, but the more I ate it started to taste odd. I ended up just throwing part of it away.  Have you ever had terrible, awful ice cream? I haven't either. Service is what makes the difference at an ice cream shop and this fell flat. Maybe it was just an off day, but my husband has already declared we will never return. I'll continue my quest for a great local ice cream shop."}
{"text":"Ice Cream and Kronuts. Whatttt! This place is also new my daughter wanted to check it out the , they give you samples and you can try as many as you want. Place is clean and the atmosphere is pleasant."}
{"text":"Super cute ice cream shop!!  I love everything about this place!  The decor is fun & everything feels clean and new.  They have roughly 16 or so flavors to choose from, and they will let you sample anything you like. There is a good mix of familiar flavors like mint chocolate cookie...and unique flavors like taro root. The ice cream is definitely higher quality and super creamy.  Prices/sizes are based on the number of scoops you want. I got a single scoop and my husband got a double. For both we paid under $8.  I loved that they use real spoons and glass dishes. It feels classier, but it is also eco friendly.   They have a small case with cake slices, cookies, brownies, and cronuts...which you can get a la mode, but I didn't try them on this visit.  Service is top notch, too!!"}
{"text":"Being the ice cream lover that I am shortly after relocating to Las Vegas I just HAD to try this place.  The ice cream was good and the service was great.  They have a lot of unique flavors. I sampled a few and went with a double scoop of the black raspberry.  It was sweet and creamy. It reminded me if the raspberry swirl ice cream my grandma used to give me for a snack when I was a kid.  The attendant that was working was really nice and had recently relocated here as well so we chatted for a bit. She was very helpful and professional. I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"taro and macapuno flavor is good. but 5 stars for their mango flavor with mango bits. already ordered and finished a scoop each of taro and mango and about to order 2 more scoops of mango!!! it is that good!!! much, much better than the comercially sold ones! and nice touch for their board games. family and friends can play with each other, not just being glued to their gadgets! gotta go and turn this phone off!!! :-)"}
{"text":"Ice cream is amazing. Cute shop set up. Staff is very helpful, especially if you're indecisive lol. Will absolutely be back here. Would suggest catching them on off hours because there can be a little line sometimes. (Absolutely positively get a cronut sundae with your fave ice cream flavors, it's magical!)"}
{"text":"I had a maple cronut plus a scoop of eis cream...absolutely wonderful!  Everyone should give this beautiful place a try."}
{"text":"Friendly customer service and great, fresh flavors for the ice cream! The fruit-flavored ice creams have real chunks of fruit in them. My friends and I got the mango ice cream, the strawberry cheesecake, and a cookie dough milkshake; all three of them were delicious. This is a family-owned business that deserves much support! The interior decoration is adorable as well. It's a cute little cafe where you can spend time with friends and enjoy yummy eis cream :)"}
{"text":"All the flavors look and sound delicious! I had the raspberry truffle and it was divine! It had dark chocolate and chocolate chips. The lady said it was limited edition. I wish they'd keep it. I also had a bite of my best friend's chocolate almond fudge. That flavor was super amazing too!   The service alone deserves 5 stars. The two ladies working were so nice and friendly.   I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"So glad we checked yelp before heading out to just any ice cream place. The reviews are right, this place is great! We also love supporting new mom and pop businesses. Who would have known we would stop in on their first year anniversary. We tried both the brownie sundae and the banana split. The homemade ice cream was delicious. Cute little place to visit with friends and have some delicious EIS cream."}
{"text":"Great find!!!! UBE ice cream soooooooo gooooooood!!!! Excellent service too!!  Ample parking... much needed addition to the area"}
{"text":"It was hot out (when is it not hot in Vegas?) and I had a hankering for a cold dessert, but it was National Donut Day, and I also felt the need to celebrate. Did some Googling and came across Eis Cream Cafe. Cronuts? Ice cream? Sold!  I headed over after dinner and got there about half an hour before closing. They were out of cronuts, which wasn't too surprising, so I opted for an ice cream sandwich instead. I got an oatmeal raisin cookie on one side, and a peanut butter cookie on the other with butterscotch ice cream in between. It was good. It wasn't great. The ice cream was super cold and hard, and since they were closing, I didn't want to wait around and let it melt a bit. It probably would have been better if the cookies had been heated up to melt it a bit. They cookies were nice and chewy, but I actually think they would have been better without the ice cream.   Would I go back? Probably not. I liked it, but I really wasn't wowed."}
{"text":"The ice cream is super creamy and delicious!   The shop is very clean and adorable! It's awesome to see a place where it shows how much hard work went into making this as awesome as it is!   We will definitely be returning, even if we do live across town!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the ice cream, have tried: vanilla, green tea, and peach.  I also enjoyed the cronut.  Decent prices, currently offering a groupon deal.  Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"While the ice cream is good the prices are outrageous.  $4 for a single scoop of vanilla with some sprinkles is a rip off.   There are better places in the area that are cheaper. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Eis is a welcome addition to the foodie growth areas in the Eastern and Silverado Ranch area!   a. Family business - I really enjoy small family businesses and this one is no exception. The family from Northern California has started a fun and exciting little Ice Cream Shop selling all their favorite ice creams and other sugary delights.  b.  Cronuts - I did not think I would enjoy what is a cross between a donut and a croissant, however, it was tasty and I would eat these over Krispy Kreme which is in the same strip mall.  c.  The Ice Cream - Not sure what or who the manufacturer is, but they do drive the ice cream down from Northern California or have relatives / friends bring it to them.  So this is a real \"import\".  The ice cream was pretty good and I would come back for it. Nothing particularly mind blowing, but very good, creamy and I really love those flavors loaded with all the extra fixins and bits.  d.  The Ambiance - Very eclectic.  Nicely decorated in a homey amateur way.  A few tables to sit, but oddly set up and not enough space.  If / when they get busy, there will not be enough tables for sure.  e.  Get over there - Get on over to this place and try it out. It is fun, it is family, it is a good experience.  A very solid 3.75 stars rounded up to four for this review.  GK says, check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is so adorable! The interior is amazing with all the ice cream art on the wall. The ice creams are very rich, flavorful, and really cute too. The colors of the ice cream just makes them pop up more and that's what makes them so cute. It almost looks unreal. On top of that, the presentation is beautiful. They place the ice creams on a fancy looking cup. I almost didn't want to eat my ice cream because it was too pretty. The employees are also very kind and helpful. I would definitely go back for another mint chocolate chip ice cream!"}
{"text":"I heard about this new ice cream shop through a flyer that was dropped off at my office. The lady dropping it off seemed really nice and excited about the new place. The girls from work and I decided to try it since I had been craving ice cream and we would receive 10% off with the flyer. The location is very easy to find since you can see it from the street.  There's plenty of parking since it's in a big, busy plaza. Once we went in to the shop we warmly greeted by the same lady that dropped off the flyers. I loved how cute the place is decorated. I haven't seen a lot of dessert places decorates this pretty. From the big sparkly Eis logo on one of the walls to the ice cream pattern on the chairs, I loved it all! There's pleanty of options for the ice cream.. A lot of exotic flavors as well like taro pineapple, coconut and peach. I normally don't like anything peach flavor, but it really was calling my name. It was a light peach color and you could see pieces of fruit too! I had to taste it and I had to order a scoop of it. The server said it was made with fruit straight from the Philippines. My friends also tried a chocolate cone and another flavor that was green... I can't remember what ut was but she said it was very good as well. I'm sold one this place. The service was quick, it's cheap and just from looking at the ice cream you can tell it's going to taste delicious! The place also offers cake, floats, cookies and little candies.. This place really is a must when you're in the mood for something sweet!"}
{"text":"Some of the most flavorful ice cream I've had.  The flavors they serve are so real and amazing.  I've finally found an ice cream shop that if ever I have a craving, this is where I'll get my fix!  The taste and finish of their ice creams beat even the best of store bought brands, which really impressed me.  I always thought it was good enough to buy a pint at supermarket and enjoy it at home.  When I go eat out, I want to enjoy a good experience and be wow'ed...Eis Cream did that!  The flavors are true to what they are named.  The Purple Yam is creamy, has pronounced bits of yam (ube) and not hints of it, and you can tell that the sugar is well blended in, not doused in it.  This is my all time fav.  I thought I liked the Magnolia brand ice cream, but nope, Eis Cream has the best version.  Peanut Butter Cup--If you like Reese's peanut butter cups, this is for you and they don't hold back the peanut butter taste yet not overpowering.  Cookies n cream--Good size pieces of cookie in there.  That's how I like it.  Macapuno (baby coconut)--creamy milk from dairy and coconut with generous slivers of soft fleshy coconut.  This is how it should be.  Is Magnolia taking notes??  Their strawberry cream is really good is better than their strawberry.  I liked how they let me try all the flavors.  Maybe the girl behind the counter knew I was an ice cream purist :)  I don't usually write reviews for places that stick out in my mind.  If you're tired of store-bought ice cream, come here.  This place will wow your taste buds.  Trust me, you'll be glad you went."}
{"text":"Came here with David S. for a afternoon snack.   What they offer is ice cream including some Asian flavors as the owner is Filipino.  They had also some baked goods like cronuts, cookies, french macarons, etc, but I did not have any baked goods.   We tried a few samples, but I opted for green tea and the ube. I like all forms of green tea and theirs is more on the light side of things, more fruity floral type tea than deep bitter matcha. Ube was really good, nicely flavored. The texture of both ice cream was ideal, creamy and smooth. David opted for the Filipino classic flavor combo of ube with macapuno ice cream.   The interesting thing is our treats weren't scooped into a disposable vessel, but crystal goblets and we were given silverware since we decided to eat in. I thought it's kinda cute and fits the cutesy interior with Hello Kitty accessories.   The girl helping us was super friendly and personable.   I am a fan of the ice cream here, even though it's not made here, but at Treat from San Jose. I think the portions and flavor was good so I will be back."}
{"text":"When you first walk in the decor is pretty cute. Especially cool for kids. There are ice cream painting all over the wall and a book with all their different options. The girl that greeted me was really sweet, allowing me to try multiple flavored of ice creams before making my final decision. I opted out for the banana split and I added a macaron cookie on top. DELICIOUS! The ice cream they have is actually from San Jose and the quality of it is outstanding. For my banana split I had vanilla, strawberries and cream and last but not least brownie al a mode. For my topping I had chocolate syrup, whipped cream, and cherries with the macaron cookie. It was $9.75....(granted I added a lot of stuff) I believe regular banana split is around $7.50.... I will definitely be back my scoops were huge too I couldn't even finish the whole thing! Other yelpers made a little skeptical in regards of the \"small scoops\"??? but As far as I'm concerned I had NO COMPLAINTS!"}
{"text":"Nice little Ice cream shop!  We were greeted with a smile, and the server was happy to let us taste test as many different flavors as we wanted.   They make there ice cream by hand in small batches.  It's a different flavor than anything I've ever tasted.  I got pistachio, it had real pistachios in it.  But it was something about the flavor I didn't care for.  I also got I think it was banana cream, I didn't care for that either.   Now on the other hand, my husband really liked it, he will return!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little ice cream shop!  The decor was absolutely darling with bright colors everywhere. My favorite was the chairs with ice cream printed design.  We were immediately greeted by the owner/manager, who is such a sweetheart! Wonderful customer service :) She said that they get their ice cream from TREAT in San Jose, CA (woot woot--BAY AREA!).  The exotic flavors like taro/ube, pineapple coconut, macapuno, and mango are made with fresh fruit from the Philippines.   Don't be shy with samples!  They were all very good.  My husband recommends the peach even though he went the more dessert flavor route.  Here is what we got:  -2 scoop sundae w/ Pineapple coconut and mango ice cream topped with pineapples and a buko pandan stick-o. -2 scoop ice cream w/ cookies 'n' cream and tin roof sundae -Maple bacon cronut   You can get whip cream or syrups on your sundae like chocolate, white chocolate, caramel.There are a variety of other goodies here like cronuts, donuts, cake, cookies.  You can order a scoop or two of ice cream, ice cream cookie sandwiches, sundaes, or floats.  This is the perfect place to satisfy your sweet tooth and keep cool, especially with this HOT summer weather! My next concoction will be ube (purple yam) with macapuno (young coconut) ice cream!  Minus one star for prices being a little steep for my taste...but you get 10% off with flyer or yelp check-in! =)"}
{"text":"Just came here for the first time with 6 other family members. Between us, we had the chocolate, taro, mango, burgundy cherry, and green tea ice creams, as well as lemon sherbet. Everything was delicious! I am picky about chocolate ice cream and don't like many other brands out there, but this was quite possibly the best I have had: not too sweet, actually tastes like chocolate, and the texture was perfectly creamy and smooth. The mangos in their ice cream are apparently from the Philippines; I'm not surprised that they only use the freshest ingredients, it's evident in the wonderful flavor of their product.   The perfect treat when it's 102 degrees outside!"}
{"text":"I love Eis Cream Cafe!!! The ice cream here is fantastic!!!  The mango flavored ice cream is the best I've ever tasted!! I don't get fruity ice cream that often and I usually prefer anything with chocolate. Since my last visit, I've had the Taro, Pineapple Coconut, and Peach Cobbler and they all taste wonderful with right amount of sweetness.  I have to give them credit for taking me out of my comfort zone.   The ice cream is imported from Northern California, certain new flavors come out based on the season.   They have lots of other sweet treats like kronuts, macaroons and candies.  Place is very cutesy decorated it goes well the type of theme. The customer service is exceptional!!! Tanya and her staff are super friendly and knowledgeable!!!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was delicious and really hit the spot! The ice cream and waffle cone was fantastic. I had a double scoop with heath ice cream on the bottom and the Macapuno young coconut on top. The macapuno is amazing and I highly recommend it. Perfect for the Las Vegas heat. Worth a trip off the strip for."}
{"text":"I love supporting new businesses especially when they have something good to offer! I decided to swing by the establishment on a hot Saturday afternoon and my oh my, I felt like I found a gold mine. The cashier was friendly and gave me a bunch of samples because I wasn't being reluctant on what to order. My little heart was torn between ube, mango, and chocolate. I finally settled for the chocolate.   The ice cream itself was rich and creamy. I'm not a big fan of sweet things but I'm a sucker for ice cream.   I also got a mini cronut. I believe it was the maple bacon. It was a perfect size for me!  Definely will be back for a big scoop of ube ice cream."}
{"text":"This place is the best family owned ice cream shop around. The favors are unique and full of flavor, they have board games to play while you eat, and freshly made sweets too. The young coconut, mango, taro and butter pecan are my fiancé and my favorite flavors. The kids love the birthday cake and sherbets they have. Some of the flavors may sound familiar but the taste is better than any others that you've had."}
{"text":"Best ice cream in town, family owned and incredibly friendly staff !! Much better than anything the city has to offer,"}
{"text":"The shop is in a great location. The ice cream is amazing and made using all natural ingredients. The Cronuts were delicious! The best I've had so far in town. They also sell macaroons. Quaint ice cream shop with great customer service."}
{"text":"Friendly lady behind the counter, tried a handful of samples. Ended up taking up a cup of peach and coffee almond fudge. Very unique flavors and genuine ingredients. The peach has a great texture."}
{"text":"Cute spot, excellent customer service, and good quality ice cream! Thank you guys for putting a smile on our faces tonight! :)"}
{"text":"Items Selected: Samples - ube, macapuno, peach cobbler, burgundy cherry, pralines and caramel, coffee and toffee Warm Double Chocolate Brownie Ube on Chocolate Chip and Macadamia Nut Sandwich  Owned and operated by Alexis Gonzaga, a charming young lady who was (wo)manning the small shop solo when I arrived shortly after the 2:00pm opening on Saturday, Eis Cream is not exactly the artisan experience some might expect, but with cutesy décor including Hello Kitty merchandise paired with good sourcing and a few housemade items the overall effect is quite nice.  Small in size but sizable in selection, with ice creams imported from Treat in No.Cal matched to locally baked goods from Al's, Valerio's, and more it was with pleasant conversation about flavor profiles and why specific vendors were chosen that I chatted with Ms. Gonzaga during the course of my visit and sampling several ice creams with results ranging from bold (burgundy cherry, ube) to overly icy and sweet (peach cobbler, macapuno) I eventually opted to invest in the ube alongside the only three items made in house - a duo of cookies and a chocolate brownie, each served hot from the tray.  Beginning first with the ube, apparently oft mistaken for taro by guests, I was immediately taken by the starchy potato textures admixing with cream plus subtle sweetness and pairing this with cookies and crushed peanuts the ice cream sandwich shined, my favorite bites coming at the end as the melted ice cream melded with butter and macadamia nuts with a decidedly tropical tilt.  Moving onward to an option without ice cream, I could not help but order one of the restaurant's brownies when I saw the pan procured fresh from the oven and with dark chips strewn amidst a semi-sweet base the result was decidedly decadent, the sort of thing that would have gone excellent with milk...or as the base of a sundae, the pralines and coffee a seemingly brilliant pairing though I imagine vanilla would work quite nicely as well.  Not quite as impressive as Sweet Addictions if only due to overall lack of house made cookie options I can definitely see Eis Cream improving with time and customer feedback provided the small store can generate enough foot traffic and staying power given its tucked away location on the backside of a strip mall on South Eastern.  Potentially a bit overpriced given the quality of the goods, the upcharge on Al's already sub-par Kronuts particularly perplexing, it is a good option for those in the neighborhood or those seeking something different - the hand packed half-gallons potentially a tempting proposition for those picking up a cake from nearby Freed's."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday evening after eating thai food and ordered 1. Sm Cronut - maple bacon, 2.25  2. Lg Cronut - White chocolate cinnamon and birthday cake, 6.50  3. Reg. cookie sandwich - rocky road and chocolate chip, 3.99 10% yelp check in for $12. 41   - Tanya was very friendly and knowledgeable. She took the time to explain everything to us and sample flavors before we bought - Nice plating. - Seems like they don't make anything themselves? Just received from other places and sold. - But as nice as they were, I wasn't too impressed with the taste.   - Cookie sandwich was okay. hard cookie. We ended up eating the ice cream and throwing away the rest of the cookie.  - Maybe I just like Cold stone best when it comes to texture of Ice cream.... - Eis means Ice in German - With the Yelp check-in, the cronut is cheaper than Als."}
{"text":"A little ice cream shop on Eastern and Silverado Ranch (behind Office Depot). I pass by here every time I go to the office but due to my lactose intolerance, I haven't had the gut(s) to try this place until today since it's my day off and can actually afford to get sick.  The lady behind the counter was very pleasant and was telling me about the store and their product. Their ice cream are made from seasonal fruits like peaches, cherries, etc. They have tropical/Asian/Filipino/Hawaiian flavors such as coconut-pineapple, taro/purple yam/ube (pronounced \"ooh-beh\" not \"yoob\"/\"yoobee\"), green tea, etc. There's the traditional flavors like chocolate, rocky road, tin roof, mint chip, pistachio, coffee, etc.  We tried the cherry, mint chip, green tea and ube ice cream. I wasn't too crazy about the green tea - it has a soapy taste to it. However, their waffle cone was awesome -crisp, light and the right sweetness.   They ran out of cronuts. Their macarons are from the same supplier that Venetian has.   The interior is so cute. They have cute chairs and wall mural. They also sell chocolate bars and Hello Kitty items."}
{"text":"A charming gem! The most delicious flavors of ice cream and some seriously large scoops! Relaxed atmosphere with board games on the tables. Loved that we didn't feel rushed."}
{"text":"Newly opened gem serving delicious ice cream and other treats.  I had the peach cobbler which was like eating the real thing. The wife and sister had ube and coconut pineapple, which they both loved as well.  Oh and they serve cronuts as well!  Definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"I typically don't really go out for ice cream. In fact, I rarely eat ice cream anymore but when this opened and I saw it on yelp, I wanted to try it due to the stunning reviews about their taro/ube ice cream. Therefore when I had some friends in town, we took them along and we all tried this new place together!   The place itself is quite quaint. It's pretty small but the decorations are really cute. However, when we went, there was only one person working soooo it was quite backed up. There was a party of 4-5 that was already there. Then my group was a total of 7 people. So it took a while to be able to try the ice cream and pick. I mean, it's fine, I don't mind but for those that do, keep that little fact in mind before going.   You're free to sample whichever flavor that you want. I think I tried taro, mango, macapuno (young coconut), and heath bar. In the end, my friend and I decided to share a scoop of taro/ube and heath bar. I also tried some of my friend's cookies and cream.   The cookies and cream was amazing. One of my favorite ice cream flavors :D so it captured my heart. I rarely ever buy cookies and cream at the grocery stores cause it comes in such a huge tub and I could never finish. Now I know where to get my cookies and cream fix!   The taro/ube was pretty good. Has a nice flavor to it. I mean, I'm not CRAZY over it but it was decent.   As for the heath bar, I think I've had better. I think it needs more pieces of heath bar in there. It was really nice when I finally go to a piece of the toffee though!  I didn't really care for the macapuno mainly because I'm not a fan of coconut. I also didn't really care for the mango ... maybe because it tasted like they made it out of the dried mangos you would buy in packages. Haha.   The prices are pretty decent from what I've experienced. They also give you HUGE scoops. Also, from what the woman told us, they get their ice cream from San Jose.  So don't hesitate to give this place a try. Glad to finally see something amazing open on my side of town ;D"}
{"text":"OMG! What a delicious place to get natural ice cream..great flavor a to choose from(Coffee Almond Fudge is my favorite) a friendly environment as well. Certainly has become instantly one of my fav spots to get ice cream at from now on. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Very delicious.  Hard to pick a flavor. They all taste super fresh. Pineapple coconut,  mango, and watermelon are my favorites. Want to go here every day. The girl that is there most of the time is super sweet. She explains all their products."}
{"text":"One of the best ice cream spots I have been to, that isn't the typical cold stone and Baskin Robbins taste. Variety of flavors are good like the ube, mango, and pistacho, but hope over time they will increase the amount they carry. Menu items like brownie sundae or the kronut sundae helps Eis Cream differentiate itself from some other ice cream shoppes. Maybe giving the option of milkshakes will help business as well?  The decor is cute and simple,but still makes a statement.  Definitely a great spot to take the kids or even adults who are craving something sweet!"}
{"text":"A wonderful, Family owned ice cream shop, what could be better? With flavors ranging from Taro to Green Tea.. They have whatever you could think of. Prices are great & the employees are very friendly. With a happy atmosphere to bring anyone back to their childhood memories, I definitely recommend this place to get away from the \"oh so wonderful\" Las Vegas heat!"}
{"text":"The Eis cream flavors they have are so so good! The Ube, macapuno and mango are all flown in from the Philippines, so legit!! The staff and owners are super nice and I love the feeling of community. Would highly recommend this spot ;)"}
{"text":"Mom and pop ice cream shop with some flavors to entice the American crowd but they also have some assorted Asian flavors (mango, young coconut, ube labelled as taro).  I'm not sure what brand of ice cream they are serving, but it is rich and creamy.  I sampled the taro and the mango.  The taro tastes similar to the Magnolia brand one, but the one I ended up getting in a waffle cone was the mango. The mango ice cream tastes like Philippines brand dried mango (not hard and chewy though), but the owner informed me the mangoes come from Cebu for the ice cream.  Besides just ice cream, they also have cronuts and macarons in assorted flavors and candy treats for the kids! I like that they also serve the ice cream in these ice cream sundae glasses for those who want to eat the ice cream in the shop. A definite hole in the wall gem tucked into this Silverado ranch strip mall."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this ice cream shop. Great flavors quality ingredients you can taste. The pineapple coconut and banana walnut were favorites. Loved the wide assortment.  The cookies for the ice cream sandwich were still warm and soft.  Chocolate coconut & maple walnut cronuts were excellent. This will be a must stop on every trip back to Vegas.   Great friendly service too"}
{"text":"Cute little local business with delicious ice cream, excited to try some pastries next time!"}
{"text":"First time here. We were greeted as soon as we walked in by the Owner, Alexis. She's a super sweet lady, very helpful and polite.   Very cute little shop. They sell cronuts (croissant/donuts), strawberry or cream filled with assorted toppings. A variety of ice cream flavors that include Ube, which is my favorite. They also have macaroons, connolis, cookies, and surprisingly they had Pimiento (Bite Size), AND Organo Coffee! Two other things that I love! although she didn't have the flavor coffee I wanted (Cafe Latte) I'll definitely be back to buy it. Aside from all that, there's a little area that they have that sells a bunch of hello kitty gifts/goodies."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Ice cream tastes freezer burned and the flavors I wanted were barely there so I declined them because I didn't want ice and left out ice cream. I won't stray from Nielsons again."}
{"text":"This is a really cute place for a fun family outing...They even have board games....Th Pistachio ice cream is soooo good...very nice staff also"}
{"text":"Great lil spot! ! Family owned and you can definitely feel it.  You can tell the employee's have a sense of pride working here... even better is the product! !  Being from the Bay Area you can tell they brought home to the 702..  2 scoop looks like a 4 scoop, also dont be afraid to sample ALL the flavors.  Recommend this place over Coldstone for sure!"}
{"text":"The ice cream was okay. I ordered a rainbow sherbet and it was like any other sherbet you could get from the supermarket. Personally, I feel like Baskin Robins is much better. Their flavors are also seasonal and can easily go out of stock. The place looked like it needed a cleaning and seemed quite outdated. There's also little to no signage indicating if there's even an ice cream shop. While I found the ice cream unimpressive, the server was very nice and that made up for everything being so plain."}
{"text":"Finally got to check out Eis and it was pretty good. Located in the Target plaza on Eastern, on the other side of Windy City, the boba place, etc.  Came here primarily for macarons and they had all 12 flavors available. We got the dozen for $15 and they were on the smaller size (think 'Lettes). So far the flavors have been spot on and the shell is perfectly crispy but chewy in the middle. The jam fillings are not overly sweet and just the right amount.  Tried a sample of the macapuno ice cream and it was delish. Was told it's made with real coconut. I didn't see the 9 cone sampler, but when asked if still available was told she could still make it for me if I wanted. Real nice of her to offer.  The worker was very friendly, informative, and patient. Would come back for the macarons or maybe to try a macaron ice cream sandwich."}
{"text":"Wonderful ice cream and great work switching to metal spoons!  Good for the environment and for the customers!  YAY!"}
{"text":"Yum. Came here twice now and both times did not disappoint. We ordered the halo halo for roughly around six dollars and it was  well worth it. You're traditional Filipino still halo halo but instead of ube yam they use ube ice cream, but it is an ice cream place so it is to be expected. They also serve many many flavors of ice cream, such as: mocha, taro, strawberry, chocolate mint, and even tropical flavors like macapuno. The place does have mini sit down tables and an outside seating as well. They also serve fresh baked cookies and some macaroons. They serve other packages sweet goodies on the counter as well. They have a booklet where you can look up different types of desserts they make. They have ice cream cookie sandwiches, macaroon sandwiches, and banana splits!"}
{"text":"I gave it 2 stars cause the cronuts were so good... Til we found pube-like hair strand in one of them. Can't go back. ;(  Customer service is great though and cute little place."}
{"text":"After a very filling and delicious dinner at a nearby restaurant, nothing sounded better than a nice big bowl of ice cream.  Ei's is a cute little ice cream spot. The owner's really paid a lot of attention to detail. Decor, murals, tables and chairs are absolutely adorable with a sparkly ice cream motif.   The menu is pretty diverse with options of ice cream, sundaes, kronuts, macarons and ice cream sandwiches. I was tempted by the kronut sundae but opted for two scoops in a bowl. I got taro and green tea, while my friend ordered the tin roof and coffee in a bowl.   The ice cream was creamy and refreshing. According to their website all the ingredients are natural and they ship their product in from the Bay Area. The ice cream is tasty, but on the overly sweet side for my taste. I'm a fan of more subtle flavors, so if I returned I'd likely stick to one scoop orders to try other flavors.   The location is a little hard to describe and I hope it doesn't dissuade people from visiting this hidden spot. They are on the corner of Silverado Ranch and Eastern.  I would have no qualms giving this place another shot when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Cute little ice cream shop with all the works. We decided to go fancy for our first time here. I got the banana split and my husband had the brownie Sunday. Both were really good and even the brownie itself was exceptional. They were all out of macaroons when we went but I can't wait to go back and try them!"}
