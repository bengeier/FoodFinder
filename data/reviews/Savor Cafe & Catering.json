{"text":"What can I say, I have never had a bad meal at Savor. Everything is a fresh as it gets, cool atmosphere, good service and simple yet amazing food. This is really my favorite low key spot to enjoy a nice meal."}
{"text":"Come check out the new outdoor  patio!!!!!! Amazing views of uptown and stadium. I live in the area and cant wait to walk down for brunch and bloody's. Had a great time. Drinks were fantatic. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place is amazing. I bought a Living Social voucher on whim and my husband and I stopped in for lunch. We are so glad we found this place! I already want to go back! They have a great menu where everyone can find something to try. The pairings of food are unique, but completely complimentary to each other.  Everything is made on sight and you can tell; it all tastes delicious, fresh, and savory. We love the local and seasonal food emphasis. They also serve organic coffee and trying dessert is a must! The portions sizes are extremely filling and our waiter was so accommodating. We are already telling friends that they have to try this place!"}
{"text":"We celebrated 3 birthdays for lunch on Monday, October 13th.  I called the week before to make a reservation for our party of 8.  When we arrived, our reservation had been given to another party.  At first I was upset, but they immediately made accommodations for us.  I'm SO glad we did not leave - the food here is great.  We ordered 3 appetizers - Crispy Soul Rolls, Traditional Hummus, and the Pimento Cheese Dip with Kettle Chips and all of them were delicious.  I ordered the Pulled BBQ Chicken Sandwich with kettle chips and it was really good and a lot of food.  A couple of people ordered the Grilled Meat Loaf, one ordered the special of the day - a Buffalo Chicken Wrap, and a couple of burgers were ordered - all were delicious and no complaints.  For dessert we shared the Mile High Peanut Butter Pie, a Chocolate Cola Cake and the Butterscotch Bread Pudding.  They were all SO very good, but the Butterscotch Bread Pudding was the best if you have to make a choice from those three - tough decision though.  Because of the issue with our reservation they provided two of our appetizers on the house - you can't beat that kind of customer service!  This is a great place with excellent food and friendly service.  I will definitely be back - a must try!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! I have gone @ least a dozen times..I bring out of town friends& family...the food is always so fresh & tasty...the staff is wonderful...BTW their bread pudding is out of this world.. #imhooked onsavor"}
{"text":"Great Cobb salad (I subbed turkey for grilled chicken)! Bad salad dressing can make or break a salad, so I was really happy when I tasted their perfect buttermilk ranch. A great lunch spot."}
{"text":"We went to Savor last night for the first time, and it was absolutely fantastic! What a cute little place! I love their focus on local and seasonal foods, so I was really excited to try this place. I had one of the nightly specials, the NC red fish, with the vegetable medley (asparagus, green beans, carrots, and brussels sprouts). It was one of the better fish meals I've ever had at a restaurant, and veggies were perfection! My husband, who doesn't care for fish at all, wanted my dish instead! He got the porkchop over their succotash risotto, which was also really delicious. The other couple we were with each ordered the pan fried chicken and they really enjoyed it. We also each had a drink - bourbon and ginger for the hubs ($4 house liquors on Saturday night!) and a blackberry mojito for me - so tasty and refreshing! We then split the banana pudding dessert - amazing. Fantastic service as well. We will definitely be coming back here soon!!!"}
{"text":"First time at Savor and I thought it was fairly good for the price. The Drunken Collards were excellent, Mojo chicken sandwich wasn't that impressive, lacked the big juicy flavor I was hoping for. The peach/berry cobbler was delicious! I'd go back for the collards and 1/2 price wine night :)"}
{"text":"We arrived at 11:50 am on a Tuesday and snagged the last table.  I thought we would have been there earlier, but had trouble finding a place to park.  A very friendly waitress took our order almost immediately, but it took 30 minutes to get our food.  During that time, we saw several people walk in and leave when they saw no tables were available.   The noise level was very high in this place.  i had difficulty understanding the person sitting across from me.    I had the Cuban sandwich with a side of macaroni and cheese, $9.50.  In my opinion, the quality of the roast pork makes or breaks the Cuban;  in this case it was subpar.  They forgot the grilled cheese, but I was hungry and wasn't about to send it back after waiting so long.   The ham and bread were both quite good, and it would have been an excellent Club sandwich.  But as a Cuban, it was a significant fail.    The mac and cheese was very good, made with a sharp white cheddar, but it was very dry.  It could of benefited from more sauce.    My friend had the Mediterranean salad, $8.  She said the olives were a high quality."}
{"text":"This is probably the best kept secret in Charlotte. We have been here for both lunch and dinner and have never been disappointed. Everything is very fresh and made to order. The shrimp & grits are probably the best that I have had anywhere in the south. The desserts are absolutely incredible. Part of the secret ingredient here is that the chef is a Johnson & Wales instructor. Don't think twice about this place."}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience! Inspired menu with just the right amount of creative diversity. Entrees were freshly prepared and full of flavor. Desserts were sinfully rich and tasty. Service was attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots in the whole city.  I feel like nobody knows about this place.  The food is always top notch (especially the salmon and the meatloaf)  and the service is always great.  Try a specialty cocktail when you are in there too."}
{"text":"The menu isn't huge, but the food is great. The service is always good too!   I love the ambiance here and would highly recommend for a date night."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been eating at Savor since they opened. They catered our rehearsal dinner, and we live about a mile north of the restaurant. We simply love it here.  We ate at Savor yesterday as a farewell dinner for my mother who had been in town for 11 days. My wife got the Mojo Chicken Sandwich, as well as the cheese grits (best in the city for her tastes). My mom got the ham/broccoli/cheddar quiche (loved it), and I got the special which was a turkey pastrami rueben with corn pudding (I'd have liked it with jalapeno's, but i'm being picky). The Rueben was delicious, and was heightened by the excellent marble rye from Golden Grains Bakery (which is, sadly, commercial only!).   We took home the Mile High Peanut Butter Pie, which really should be illegal it's so good.   This is a great place, and it deserves to be known as one of the better places to eat lunch/dinner in the city."}
{"text":"I've checked out Savor twice now -- once for lunch and last night for dinner. I like the unpretentious vibe, scale ( just a dozen or so tables) and very friendly service.  For dinner, I was pleased with chili glazed salmon -- cooked just right and with a nice little kick from the chili.  I also thought the side veggies (which come with several of the entrees) were nicely cooked and liked the inclusion of asparagus and brussels sprouts.  For my husband, the salmon foccacia BLT and side of cheese grits hit the spot.  While we ended up sticking to the standard menu, they had quite a few enticing specials. We grabbed a tasty bing cherry and blueberry cobler for the road with vanilla ice cream.   I'll definitely be back and will always leave room for dessert."}
{"text":"Tonight was my second visit to Savor.  they have doubled the size of the restaurant since my first visit, so that as exciting to see.  Dinner was beyond delicious, I had the red fish with butternut squash risotto.  this was by far the best fish I have ever had in my life!  Really, I am now wishing I had ordered one to go.  My daughter had shrimp and grits and said it was her favorite, hands down.  My husband ordered the meatloaf.  It was delicious, just beware it is spicy.   Very fresh ingredients and very pleasant wait staff.  Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite place in Charlotte. I went there last night with my boyfriend. I had the shrimp and grits and he had the barrel fish special. We spent the entire meal switching back and forth because we couldn't decide which was better. I have had my share of Charleston shrimp and grits and I would say this rivals some of the better ones I've had. The barrel fish was mild yet flavorful and meaty. It came with couscous which was light and fluffy. My only complaint was that I didn't save room for dessert! Anyone looking for Carolina costal food should definitely check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"This may be Southern Fusion, but not true Southern (try Dish for that!). GF has been here many times for lunch and loves it. First time for dinner:  We both got the meatloaf, veggies and mash taters - excellent. 2 meals, beer, and wine - $35."}
{"text":"Had the barbecue beef brisket special.  Not sure how they got all the flavor out of that meat, but it makes me wonder what they did with it.  The squash casserole was palatable, everything else (including the food on my partner's plate) was bland, textureless, lifeless.  Probably not going back."}
{"text":"Wow! Found this place through Zagat's and Yelp. It's wonderful - foodie heaven. Nice, friendly decor, great food, pleasant, friendly service.  He had the shrimp and sausage grits - delicious, beautiful to look at too. I had the meatloaf, which is often disappointing in a restaurant - but was absolutely wonderful. The portions were (to put it mildly) a little large - but we stepped up and managed it.  The Banana Pudding truly lived up to its reputation as phenomenal. I really liked the meringue topping.  Prices were good, food was great, service was charming. How can you lose?"}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying Savor, a year after it was first recommended to me. And I'm kicking myself for missing out on a year of good eats!  Savor reminds me of a French bistro, in the purest sense of the word. The short menu is focused on high quality ingredients, combined in delicious, surprising ways. Horseradish mashed potatoes... salty sweet potato hash... and an amazing gin-and-strawberry-and-basil cocktail. I wouldn't call this Southern food, but many of the menu items have uniquely Southern touches, like the moist, rich, delectable Coca-Cola cake. Learn from my mistakes and put Savor at the top of your \"to-try\" list!"}
{"text":"Great find.  Very unique menu. Wonderful staff, exceptional food and a hip decor all combine to make this one one of my favorite places. The menu is full of great dishes that are one of a kind takes on your favorites but I usually get side tracked with the specials. The attention to quality and freshness are very evident. The music is also very nice. Good tunes played at a level that you can hear the music but don't have to talk over it. The best place in town for a dinner date."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today at 12:00 and was pleasantly surprised! First off, the service was great! I expected to wait for a table and for our food to take a while to come out, but we were seated right away and the food only took 10 minutes or so!  Michael was our server and he was on top of everything we needed and was very friendly.  The food was above average - we ordered the pimento grilled cheese and the veggie sub, along with home made chips and the casserole of the day - it was all great! I would definitely recommend this place to friends! Oh and we had the banana pudding for dessert and it was sooo good!"}
{"text":"This place is a little local gem for brunch.  I've come here for brunch multiple times.  They have an amazing mimosa and Bloody Mary bar and the people are extremely helpful and friendly!!  They AJ's French toast is a must have!  Their mac & cheese side is always a crowd pleaser too!!  The service isn't the fastest but they make up for it with friendliness and deliciousness!!  And it's a local community business so it's nice to know your supporting local!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, healthy, fresh food.  Great lunch spot!  Two of us had lunch there today.  The hummus appetizer was amazing.  We had the salmon entree, green salad and fruit salad and split it.  Everything on the plate was amazingly fresh and fabulous.  The salmon was prepared and cooked perfectly.  The service was very friendly and quick.  I am very impressed.  Will return ASAP!"}
{"text":"Tried this place based on a recommendation from a friend. It was well worth my time and money. We had the: hummus, soul rolls, salmon BLT w/o bacon, seasonal veggies, pan fried chicken and succatash risotto annnnd the blackberry cobbler."}
{"text":"Waited for 10 mins until I finally got up to get my own menu. Then I waited another 10 minutes and still no service. 20mins in the restaurant and no service."}
{"text":"Love this place, been there many times in the last few years. Service is always great. Food is always high quality, it's a comfortable, well designed space and the menu is always innovative. Prices are reasonable. I highly recommend this place for any occasion."}
{"text":"It's \"ok\", but the flavors on many dishes are really lacking. The Adam Bomb burger for example has essentially no flavor whatsoever, and is nothing more than a patty on a bun with a tomato, flavorless cheese, and a completely bland aoili.... and it is $9 to boot.   The ingredients seem fresh, but there is just no flavor in anything I tried on the three visits I made.  Oh and I almost forgot, the wait staff needs improvement as well. I won't say they are terrible, but they are certainly not that great either. For example I ran out of water with the appetizer, but didn't get a refill until I was almost completely done with my entire meal.   I will not be back here."}
{"text":"2.5 stars  I wish I could leave a better rating for this restaurant, as I have the feeling that when they get things *right*, they're really right.    Unfortunately, they got about half of the things we ordered wrong.  Let me start by saying that my plate was pretty delightful.  I tried the sweet chili salmon, which was well-spiced and sauced.  The asian veggies on the side were perfectly cooked and flavored, and the horseradish mashed potatoes had neither too much nor too little horseradish, which is no small feat to properly gage.  They could have been slightly warmer when they came out, and needed a touch more salt, but these are minor quibbles.  The Fiance, alas, did not have as good a dining experience as I did. He ordered a cheeseburger with everything on it but mayo (which he does. not. like).  They brought a burger with nothing BUT mayo.  We couldn't find our waitress to correct the mistake, so finally had to flag down another waiter (who, by the way, acted most appropriately: when we asked if he could find our waitress, he instead asked what we needed.) so we could get some ketchup and mustard delivered on the side.    Fiance later said the burger, even disregarding the mayo mishap, was very bland and tasted as though the beef had not been seasoned at all.  He would not order it again.  One side comes with the burgers - a fact not mentioned on the menu - so Fiance ordered the collards.  The collards here are made with smoked turkey instead of pork.  They were cooked well, but the flavor was lacking.  Not sure if that was due to the turkey, or just an absence of other seasoning in the pot?  Portions were abundant; I took about half my potatoes and salmon home, along with Fiance's leftover collards. We were both too full but wanted to try the famed banana pudding, so got an order to go.  Much later that night, we dug into the pudding.  Loved the marshmallow creme on top, but was most dismayed to find absolutely  zero vanilla wafers in the whole of the dish.  Since they're touted as being homemade and thus amazing, I was most looking forward to sampling that part of the dish.  Apparently, on this night, it was not to be.  I have heard that Savor is a better deal, $-wise, for lunch, so we may give them another try if we happen to be in that part of town for a midday meal, but I'm afraid Fiance was too disappointed to want to try dinner again.  A shame, since I do think that, under different circumstances, we might have had a much better experience."}
{"text":"We read about this place in the Observer and it sounded interesting so we marked it on our to do list.  Today we Did...and it lived up to it's reputation for excellent food and service.  I had the pulled BBQ chicken sandwich on onion bread while my wife enjoyed a Cobb salad.  I also selected the casserole of the day (squash) which was deep down southern in texture and flavor.  From beginning to end it was a beautiful experience....and while I am at it... I saved the end to last.  They are FAMOUS for their banana pudding, which happens to be my favorite dessert in the world.  I use my grandmother's recipe as the standard and few have ever come close.  While her pudding is A distant memory, my taste buds were awakened and declared this pudding to be worthy of my grandmother's kitchen.  Next time I may just start and end with the banana pudding....it's that good!"}
{"text":"Save room save room save room for dessert! 5 of us went and we all shared our food so everyone could taste different dishes.  My parents split the chicken cutlet. It was crispy on the outside and juicy and wonderful on the inside. I had the shrimp and grits.  Creamy grits, the stand your fork up in them kind,the shrimp was cooked to right consistency and very spicy. Fantastic! As for sides we all tried the Collards, macncheese, veg medley which had Brusselsprouts asparagus greenbeans carrots and sweetpotato. Yum. The pimento cheese appetizers is great to with the homemade chips. They brought more chips out too. Desserts were the best. Butterscotch bread pudding, Bing cherry and peach cobbler, banana pudding and mile high peanut butter pie.  ALL WERE VERY GOOD.   I have given 5 stars but the restaurant was cold and noisy.  Make reservations its a small place that fills up fast."}
{"text":"Small to medium size restaurant. Establishment was self seating with a bar and table spread throughout.  We waited 15 minutes before we were even given any menus.  Food was a bit pricey, and took a very long time to come out. Serving sizes were huge.   I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was really good, the waffle was a bit dry. I had to wait five minutes before I could even ASK the server to bring me syrup, and then waited five more minutes to receive it.  The kids burger is huge, and the mac & cheese is really good.  My husband ordered the pork chop with collard greens and a biscuit. The Porkchop was huge and delicious. He enjoyed it.  We got the Coca-Cola cake for dessert, the cake was huge, and tasted delicious.  While we did enjoy the food, we more than likely will not return because the service was horrible."}
{"text":"Savor is really good! I've had their Club and the grilled chicken sandwich with the chips. Their pimento is so good! I would recommend to never get their soda - it's been flat the few times that I have gotten it. Their peanut butter pie is also to die for!"}
{"text":"I'm stunned at the reviews praising this place.  Maybe I've had unusual experiences, but I've tried this place twice and found it exceedingly average.  Average presentation and flavors and average service.  Many, many better restaurants in this city than Savor."}
{"text":"I went to lunch here with my new boss and new coworker and I absolutely loved it! The place is so quaint and cute inside...love the exposed brick walls.   And the food was great as well...I got the salmon with the veggie casserole (on their specials list) and a side salad. Perfect sized portions for lunch. And the service was perfect as well.  I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Yummy Blue Cheese dip! Great pan fried chick w/ pimento cheese! Peanut Butter Pie - to die for!"}
{"text":"Four stars no more!! Very rare is it that I find a place where I want to go once or twice a week but I feel fairly confident that Savor is now that place. And I figure this out close to when I am moving out of Charlotte-sadface.   Three words: Farmers Market Sandwich. Mozzarella, tomato, fresh basil and balsamic. So simple, so delicious, so in my dreams tonight."}
{"text":"Finally made it for a dinner a while back. I had heard awesome reviews about this place and was excited to try. Great location in a cool, older building.   I had the meatloaf which was some of the best I have had in Charlotte. Also had the banana pudding for dessert. Decent beer selection and a friendly staff make this a good go to for casual dinner. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! You can eat everything on the menu and enjoy each bite. The feel of this place is both open and quite. Good datenight spot, great place for dinner with friends, proping up at the bar for a round. The bar tenders are great and the staff are friendly and honest. My favorites are the meatloaf with their mashed potatoes and veggies, salmon with mashed potatoes and veggies, and anything on the desert menu. Have fun and eat well!"}
{"text":"What a great lunch spot! Small, quaint, hidden, but so darn good! Started off asking for lemonade, thinking I'd go with a lemonade/sweet tea mix, but when the waitress said they have strawberry lemonade, I said sure. Well from the first sip the entire experience was all UPHILL from there! Chalkboard displays the specials and desserts (which I'll get to soon...). A lot of great menu options, but I decided to go with the chicken & sausage gumbo. I was not disappointed, as it was excellent. Had to order a side to homemade kettle chips (secretly while the wife was in the bathroom...ha), and they were great and we both enjoyed them.   Now for dessert...yep...peanut butter pie...it that good it deserved a picture so check out on the restaurant page. I look forward to many visits in the future!"}
{"text":"Love the food! The staff is amazing. My friends hosted my baby shower there and it was the best."}
{"text":"Great lunch today. Always a pleasure, best macaroni in town! They have great meatloaf also. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is a cute little neighborhood spot in Wesley Heights (When on earth is Yelp going to figure out it's right next to downtown, not Steele Creek, 8  miles south?) that did so well with their lunch service that they expanded to dinner service (Thurs-Sat) and also expanded their restaurant twofold to make room for a full bar. But the original section is cute with the brick walls and laid back decor.  It's a casual place to chill with friends.  I wish I could give different ratings for the different meals, because I think it's a 5/5 for lunches, and 3/5 for dinners. Is the quality that much less at dinner, you ask? No, not substantially different, but the value is not as great at lunch.    Lunch offers everything from BBQ chicken sandwich to the delicious cajun spiced Adam Bomb burger to chile glazed salmon (my hub's fave) to good salads (I add med rare salmon on my salad) to their daily specials. The Daily Specials are around $10-12 and include a large main entree with sides and a strawberry lemonade and are a big meal for not a lot of $. Their homemade kettle chips are amazing!!  Their desserts are also awesome. Coca cola cake, mile high PB pie, fruit cobblers and their really good cookies if they have them. Get the cherry white chocolate chip one if they have it. Yum! Definitely a great, popular spot for lunch with fresh alternatives.   Dinner, however, is pretty much the same food as lunch, avec shrimp and grits, pork tenderloin and other specials. I just haven't been blown away at dinner.  But the cost is $16-$26  per plate, so I have to really be craving something to pay that. I'd like to see the average dinner price be just under $20 so be a range of $13-21 and I'd go more often.    Service is always extremely friendly unlike its neighbor who shall remain nameless. I believe they are serving Saturday brunch but not Sunday, which is when I want it. They also cater, which is handy. I'd skip the hummus though."}
{"text":"Place was great. Very friendly staff. Everything Toni, our server, suggested was awesome. Got two of their daily specials, a grilled cheese, the Cuban, and the pimento cheese dip app.  We were stuffed after our meal but Toni made us try the banana pudding and I'm glad he did - again awesome. And let me clarify, he didn't make us buy it - he bought it for us. That's the kind of staff you need to have in a restaurant. He certainly made for a great and personal experience.   I will definitely go back when I'm in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of living AND working right around the corner of this little gem of a café for the past 9 months. I have eaten here mostly for lunch (pick up) but have also dined in for lunch and dinner.  Voted best lunch by Creative Loafing, Savor has established themselves as both a reputable lunch and dinner spot nestled right outside the hustle bustle of uptown. Be prepared to wait a few minutes if you are arriving right in the heat of lunchtime.  Savor has their own (very tiny) parking lot that is a pain to get in and out of, yet still better than the uptown parking situation. I usually take my chances and park on the road just outside and have yet to have any issues.  The ambience is low-key and casual with funky and eclectic décor. The wait staff have never impressed, nor disappointed me though I do think they could benefit from a few more staff members.  Because of its convenience and accessibility to uptown, Savor draws an upscale clientele--expect to be accompanied by men and women clad in business suits during lunch.    I have sampled nearly every item on the lunch menu and am most impressed by the Seared & crack peppered Salmon BLT on focaccia; Mojo marinated chicken breast Sandwich; Adam Bomb Burger and the Grilled Meatloaf. Each sandwich comes with a side--I usually order the casserole of the day and am always pleased.  The dinner is where is gets interesting. Expect to find Pad Thai on the same menu as shrimp & grits and meatloaf as well as many duplicates to the lunch menu, though bigger portions.  Out of all of these I feel especially compelled to talk about the Adam Bomb Burger. 100% grass-fed free-range beef Cajun rubbed and topped with grilled tomatoes, pepper jack cheese and smeared with a roasted red pepper and caramelized onion aioli. I am on a life-long quest to find the world's best cheeseburger (I hear it's somewhere in Paris) and this one just may be the best in Charlotte. Order it. Please.  On the flip side, the shrimp and grits fell flat. It was rather bland with the Andouille sausage gravy commanding the flavor of the entire dish. I typically like to see peppers, pancetta, tasso ham or other ingredients to diversify the flavor but, unfortunately, it was just the same bite over and over.  Though I would recommend lunch over dinner you cannot go wrong at Savor. This is a place that offers many standout dishes, at extremely reasonable prices--expect to leave already planning your next visit, unless you order the shrimp & grits."}
{"text":"Really good lunch and wonderful service.  The sandwiches and salads are fresh, sweet tea flows freely and the desserts (if you still have room) are amazing.  I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"My most recent visit was the opposite of the amazing first visit.  My meatloaf entree on this visit had incredibly shrunk.   Like shrunk by half size.  The mashed potatoes were tasteless.  The meatloaf was so dry I got choked.  The fried okra was so tough that a human being would find it impossible to bite through.  We asked the waitress if management or cooks had changed.  She said no.  But portions were smaller, less tasty, and prices remained the same."}
{"text":"The Soul Rolls appetizer are smoky collards and turkey which were different and very tasty. A n ice Thai Chili dipping sauce is greatly paired with them.  The shrimp and grits are not the heavier brown roux kind, yet a creamy version.   Me likey...lol.Tthe stone-ground grits tasted like polenta which is fine with me and the Andouille could have been a lil bit spicier for me. Shrimp were very nice size and deveined! You would not believe how some, even fine estbalishments, will not devein the shrimp. Ugh. Well, my BF had the Mojo chicken which he said was tasty, but not as flavorful for a Mojo Chicken.    Dessert was mmmm good. LOL. We gobbled the still warm butterscotch bread pudding. Just the right texture and sweetness. We also had the Peanut Butter Pie which is not as dense as one would think. It was very creamy and right amount of peanut butter. Strawberry lemonade is very refreshing and homemade.  Now it is a bit pricey, but you have to pay for appealing, good and fresh food.   Gripes:     1.There is only one bathroom in the establishment which was fine for the time of the day (1:30p) we arrived, but could not imagine rush hour lunch.   2. Saw lots of black drinking straws floating in a bucket inside kitchen walkway. I pray they are not sanitizing and reusing the straws. Ugh."}
{"text":"How many times have I driven by Savor, thinking in my head, I have to try this place.  Finally, I decide to drop by this week.  Savor could be one of my favorite restaurants, it covers all the bases.  Fresh ingredients, homemade desserts, pleasant servers and reasonable prices, all wrapped up in a simple, creative setting. The menu consist of comfort food, soups, sandwiches, salads and most importantly, sweets.    Sweet."}
{"text":"I had delicious takeout for lunch from Savor Cafe once before, but someone else picked it up so I had no idea what the restaurant looked like.  I was pleasantly surprised to walk into a cozy, two room restaurant with a modern feel.  My husband and I were there for dinner and they had the ambiance going with soft lighting and candles on every table.  It was tough to read the menu because it was so dark, but I still enjoyed the mood lighting.  I had the grilled meatloaf with veggies and horseradish potatoes and the hubby had the fried chicken cutlet with veggies and collard greens.  Both meals were good but I think I got the better end of the deal.  The meatloaf is good, but the red sauce they top it off with is the real kicker.  The sauce has a great flavor with some spice that had me sniffling by the end of the meal.  My veggies were a mixture of green beens, asparagus, and carrots that were fresh and delicious.  The horseradish in the mashed potatoes was a twist I could do without, but they were still pretty good.  Finally, on to the dessert.  I ordered the banana pudding and hubby ordered the red velvet cake.  A hush fell over the restaurant when our waitress brought out our heaping mounds of dessert.  Everyone wanted to know what we were having.  Both desserts were amazing and unforgettable.  SO good!  With prices that are about average for this type of dining ($10-$20 per entrée) I see many visits to Savor Cafe in our near future."}
{"text":"I had the salmon with waited Asian vegetables, and garlic mashed potatoes. I don't like garlic mashed potatoes and I could have ask to switch it out and they would have been very accommodating, but it was fine. The salmon was delicious, and the sated Asian veggies were tasty. I also had the banana pudding for dessert. It was a bit sweet for me, but good. Good service and not bad on the prices. Have been there before and will be returning."}
{"text":"The blue cheese bacon dip was phenomenal. And the chicken with pimento cheese & bacon is fantastic.. just finished the leftovers for lunch & wishing I still had a little bread pudding! They have the best bread pudding in Charlotte, with butterscotch chips!! Loved the new patio seating, great service as always. Their brunch is bomb too !!!"}
{"text":"YUMMY YUMMY IN MY TUMMY....another great lunch spot and this place is not a secret anymore it was packed.  I had the special a grouper sandwich on foccacia with veggie casserole it was fresh and delicious I didn't leave anything left on my plate.  The menu is a nice selection of salads, sandwiches, and it looked like a few entrees I remember seeing meatloaf but not sure what else was on there... they had a few vegetarian items to choose from as well and once again I was way to full for dessert but they looked fantastic.  I can't wait to come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Place under new ownership, and an absolute disaster. It took 45 minutes for a lunch salad to be served. I could overhear many other complaints around the restaurant. People were walking out before being served. Food was okay, but nothing to rush back for. I hope they can turn this around, because it is a cute lunch spot and used to be a great place for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Great food and great character.  Very friendly and inviting atmosphere.  Southern-style food with great taste and original recipes.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I found this restaurant by looking at the list of top 25 restaurants in the Charlotte Magazine. We came in on a Fri afternoon, to a very busy restaurant. We were greeted and it took about 5-7 minutes to seat us. Considering the crowd, we ordered our drinks and food. The place looked clean. Menus were simple. (Mgt needs to hire another waitress.) The sweet tea was good. I ordered a Cuban pork sandwich with kettle chips. My wife ordered the salmon and mashed sweet potatoes. Food was tasty. Value too. Overall, a good (not great) experience. The blackberry and peach cobbler was really good!"}
{"text":"Had the salmon BLT, which was tasty but pretty small for the price.  Went with peanut butter pie for dessert.  Not a huge fan of it, I make better pb pie.  Overall the bill, with tip, was $25 :("}
{"text":"So my buddy/fellow foodie Tim and I decided to have lunch at Savor and it was pretty decent. We started off with the soul rolls(collard greens and smoked turkey spring rolls) with chili sauce, the rolls were small and thinner than regular spring rolls, they lacked flavor and turkey but the chili sauce was good. My entree was the pulled bbq chicken sandwich with cole slaw on an onion bun with a side of squash/zucchini casserole. The sandwich was ok, but there was something missing from the bbq sauce, it was more of a tomato sauce or something, not very good at all. Tim had the bbq chicken special and he noticed the same with the bbq sauce....tomatoish....if that's a word:-) Clearly, the star of our meal was the squash/zucchini casserole, it was quite tasty!  Unfortunately, there was not much to savor on this visit..........."}
{"text":"Savor is one of my favorite hidden gems on Morehead (near freedom). The restaurant is divided into two sides with great artwork in both. The front room is brightly colored with high top and regular tables plus a full bar. The back room is exposed brick with lots of natural light from the windows. The specials are written on the chalkboard in colored chalk.   Today, I ordered the same thing I always get: Carolina Shrimp & Andouille Sausage Gravy over Yellow Stone-Ground Grits. Yum. A good size bowl of stone ground yellow grits with peppers, onion, lots of sausage, shrimp, and just the right amount of sauce. It's one of the best in Charlotte. The price is $13.50/$16.50 (lunch/dinner). My only improvement would be to add a couple more shrimp!   I came here today for a solo birthday lunch after a really long week. I mentioned to Tony (my server) that it was my bday when ordering dessert: warm butterscotch bread pudding with ice cream. I was pleasantly surprised that he brought it out with a birthday candle in it!! That was super sweet and made my day. And the bread pudding was AMAZING. That and the banana pudding are must haves.   To top it all off, he brought me my bill and told me it was all on them today. You don't run into that kind of kindness often anymore! They have a fan/customer for life!"}
{"text":"There was a little bit of a wait when we arrived, they had a lot of tables that were not cleaned off yet. However, as soon as we were seated they offered us an apology and explained that only two people were really working today. The food took a long time to come out, and when it arrived, it was cold/warm. I am giving them four stars for the customer service and because the food was amazing! Even though it was a little cold. I got the omelette with pimento cheese and it was delicious! And so were the grits. The atmosphere is really laid-back and cool. They just need to make sure they have enough people working especially on a Sunday but we'll be back."}
{"text":"Maaaaan... I wish I would have known of this place a while ago. I went with two homies and one of them goes often. She's practically a regular, and that says a lot because she's a Charlottean and a foodie.   I didn't think I'd experience anything different based on the positive reviews. But let me say that I feel like they need a real website. I like to look at the menu before I go, especially when I go out with these two girls. We're so engrossed in our conversation before we even sit down that the waiter normally has to come to our table at least 3 or 4 times before we order. Perhaps this is because they want to stay a hidden gem.   So the food....  I had all this stuff on my burger which made it good, but what made it really good is the fact that it was cooked all the way, yet still juicy. They have this roasted red pepper and sauteed onion sauce that's on point! I just kept slathering in on my burger. I could have just dipped my finger in to suck on it. Yea... it's that good.   My horseradish mashed potatoes were soooo good. Just a hint of the horseradish made it really tasty. The potatoes were creamy and no salt was needed. Perfectly seasoned!   Now the Peach Cobbler was aight. It was really sweet and I don't like pecans (again another reason I like to look at a menu beforehand), but it's all good. I also didn't like that my ice cream was on top because it was all warm and melted. I like mine on the side. My homies banana pudding looked good. I may try that the next time I come.   Soooo uuuuh yea! Go! I hear everything on the menu is good... not from the staff (they always say that) but from those who frequent this place (my Charlottean homie).  Peace"}
{"text":"Visited with clients for an evening out.  Two of us ordered the meatloaf, one ordered salmon, and the other the chicken.   Everything was prepared exceptionally and they did not skimp on portion-size, either.  Even though it was a slow evening for them,  our waitress allowed us plenty of time to converse and enjoy the evening.   We'll be back!   One note:  I wish their wine list was more extensive."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is the BEST place for good, fresh food! If I could eat here every day, I think I would!   They make everything in house and they are very responsible about getting their food source locally (or not too far of distance away). We picked to eat here two weeks in a row...crave worthy. We got three of their specials: baby back ribs, pork, and trout. All the dishes were cooked to perfection! What I appreciated the most was that they paired the sides so well...from risotto to horseradish mashed potatoes, to a mixed couscous. I also ordered their shrimp, andouille sausage and grits...oh my gosh, the flavor was phenomenal!   It's definitely comfort food and you'll want to stay and \"savor\" every bite. I absolutely loved their blackberry and peach cobbler with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top! My mouth is watering...is yours?! The coffee was great too. Beer selection was good and on the night we went they were all $2. Love the specials!  The service is super friendly, yet not intrusive on your lovely dining experience. Even as we were leaving, one of the kitchen chefs was taking a break outside and he even greeted us. Just a great energy vibe...one stop here will make you a better person!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food delicious and quiet atmosphere. I had the seared & cracked peppered salmon B.L.T. on Focaccia bread...Amazinnng!!! Great for a date, catch up with friends or even a quick bite to eat before heading uptown."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this amazing place yesterday.  We were looking for breakfast and almost left when we saw there was only a lunch menu.  The chef overheard an made us an incredible omelette & breakfast sandwich.  Very great people who are clearly passionate about making great food!  We are looking forward to coming back and eating something from the menu."}
{"text":"My friends took me to Savor for my birthday this week and I am so sorry I just now have been introduced to this great little restaurant. I was blown away by the menu. So many choices, it took quite a while to make up my mind, but how can you go wrong with fried chicken cutlet with pimiento cheese and bacon? I didn't mind waiting while I sipped my martini.   We even shared the legendary bread pudding and it was the best I've ever had! Right next to another of my faves, The Open Kitchen, I will be back soon! LOVE SAVOR."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch with my son.  Our server Maggie is fantastic. I had the mojo chicken and Brandon had the special flank steak salad (special today)   amazing spot!"}
{"text":"Charming.  The Sweet Potato Bisque tasted like a bowl of pie filling.  The Cobb Salad was fresh, nice and encouraging.  I don't find the dining area comfortable, and I am not in a rush to return to Savor."}
{"text":"I love that this place is right next to my house and I haven't tried since I moved in.  I have seen all these wonderful reviews and I was making myself wait until i became tired of Pinky's.  So my friend and I went in, the place seemed pretty cool.  Pimento and chips for a starter sounded good and it was great.  I began to think to myself, this could be my new spot.  She listed off the specials and the shrimp po boy caught my ears and taste buds.  It came with a zucchini casserole which was awesome.  Unfortunately the shrimp po boy disappointed.  The shrimp was cooked very well, but it came on an ok roll, with lettuce, and barely any sauce.  It was just bland. I'm a fatty and didn't even finish my sandwich for how plain it was.  My friend's meal did look good though so maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.  I am thinking a redo needs to be in order.  It was going so well until my entree."}
{"text":"I liked this place, the lunch was good, and a nice portion size.  The decorations are cute. It's a nice crowd and friendly staff that gave us suggestions on what to visit while in town.  I had the chicken salad sandwich and salad for like $10. I wish I had saved room for the pies that sounded delicious!"}
{"text":"I went to Savor yesterday with a few of my coworkers.  It was my first time there and let me say, where has this little GEM been hiding?!  Who knew?!  The atmosphere is bright and lively!  The service is quick and friendly.  The food is different and delicious.  But what really stood out, what I couldn't stop looking at.... was the presentation of the food!  My gosh, I wanted everything!!!!  Salads, desserts, sandwiches.... they all looked mouthwatering.  Not to mention they had a special for Horseradish Mashed Potatoes.  Give me anything with horseradish and I'm a happy camper.  I will be back and ready to try more delicious things SOON!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Groupon we decided to eat dinner here before the Charlotte Checkers Pink in the Rink game.  Not even a mile from the Panthers stadium and uptown, it's conveniently located without the hassle of being in uptown proper.  This was our first time here, but it was noticeable that the place recently expanded to accommodate more customers.  We sat on the original side, just outside the kitchen and were wowed by the smells while we had a beer and waited for a our food.  The menu is somewhat limited, but it's often good to stick to a few things and do them well.  That's what Savor Cafe does.  I ordered a sirloin burger with swiss cheese and mushrooms.  It was a thick 8 ounce patty for about $8.  I'm not sure if the meat is ground in house, but it's well done.  And contrary to urban legend, it doesn't matter if the meat is ground in house - ALL ground beef in NC must be cooked to 155 degrees at restaurants.  You can't legally order a rare or even medium rare burger in NC. Contamination occurs in the actual grinding process, so it doesn't matter if it the meats ground 100 feet or 100 miles away.   The proof is here:  http://www.deh.enr.state.nc.us/ehs/images/rules/t15a-18a.26.pdf  Anyway, the burger was just how I like it: crispy on the outside, cooked through on the inside, flavorful, and not greasy (definitely not a fried burger - it had to have been grilled).  You can get a  kaiser or wheat bun.  I got the wheat bun which was toasted and absorbed some of the mess of the cheese.  Onto the side - the vegetables. Too often I've gone to southern style diners where people have raved about their vegetables only to find out they're frozen or worse - from a can  - and taste awful.  Such is not the case at Savor.  There was fresh asparagus, green beans, carrots, and brussel sprouts in the mix.  They had little to no seasoning but still tasted great because they were fresh.  The wife had the sweet chili glazed salmon which said was very moist and flavorful.  The horseradish mashed potatoes that came with it were awesome - fresh mashed potatoes with lumps, skin, and a kick of horseradish.    We got the Coca-Cola cake dessert.  It wasn't they type of Coca-Cola cake I had growing up but was still good.  It's easily enough for two and was a mixture of a brownie with nuts, devils food cake, and a little whipped cream with a hint of coffee.  It was good, but I'm not crazy about devils cake so I can't say it was awesome.  The only thing I'd like to see added to Savor is some local beer to go with the local food.  There are 4 breweries in Charlotte with at least two more on the way, so it would be nice to see them carry them.  Right now, they only have bottles but at least they have Fat Tire.  And one other thing - as good as Savor Cafe is, don't anybody go calling or emailing Guy Fieri about it.  I want to see them succeed but I don't want to wait an hour to enjoy it just because someone saw it on the Food Network."}
{"text":"This is my mom's favorite lunch place I think! The banana pudding has toasted meringue on top and is the best banana pudding I have ever had.  The #1 reason to come here! Our last visit my mom had a grilled pimento cheese sandwich with a side salad, both generous portions and good. I had a burger and the black eyed pea salad. Unfortunately we had an ugly experience in the parking lot on my moms birthday, the owners of th bldg rent out the parking lot during games downtown and there was a parking attendant who wouldn't let us park and said we had to have a reservation. For lunch?? Here? We went elsewhere. I know this is not savor's fault, it is the fault of the greedy azz people who own the bldg, but this left such a bad taste in my mouth that I am done and won't go back."}
{"text":"Savor Cafe how do I love thee! This was my first foray into Southern Cuisine and it was awesome!!! I wasn't quite sure what to have and my server recommended I try the Pimento Cheese. What is Pimento Cheese and why hadn't I heard about it til that day? It was spicy, cheesy goodness with red peppers and kettle chips that were absolute perfection.   For my entrée he suggested I tried the Shrimp and Grits. Don't laugh but I've never had grits in my life and I was a bit skeptical but I figured why not give it try. Wow! I'm so  glad I did. The grits were cheesy and the sauce was rich and flavorful.  For dessert I strayed from my servers recommendation of Butterscotch Bread Pudding and instead went with the Brownie pudding...I should have listened to my server!  I discovered the Savor Cafe while going for a walk and I must say I'm glad I walked that way that day."}
{"text":"First visit and the Cobb Salad was delish! Very fresh! Atmosphere is quaint, casual, laid back."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. Christine was our server. We had the meatloaf. Very good and portions are generous. Wife and I split it. Had roasted root vegetable hash and seasonal veggies. Both very good."}
{"text":"Food was good. Very fresh.  Had burger with fresh mozzarella. Wait staff was very good and attentive. Low key Like a city cafe"}
{"text":"Waiter was nice but. Only one waiter on staff on a Friday night? Never got the drink I ordered.  Reminded him that he'd forgotten our appetizer. No water refills.  Ok fine - he's stretched thin. Food arrives and both mains are greasy. Like sitting in cold oil greasy. Sides were good. Dessert ended up in the trash."}
{"text":"So we walked in on a Saturday at 11a and expected brunch. Nope, only Sunday. Okay. Our waitress didn't know the menu well. The food is overpriced for the quality. Coffee sucks, taste like what you get on an airplane. Bad lettuce on my husbands burger. Waitress rarely checked on us. We were the only table in the joint! One guy sitting at the bar. Staff was gathered in the kitchen talking about the shifts they wanted... why do i have to listen? Food took a long time. Not going back."}
{"text":"Just be aware that 11-3 on Saturday is only Brunch, not Brunch or Lunch. There is only the Brunch menu available. Several groups were surprised by this while we were there...including us. We were there at 1 p.m. About a third of the menu involves gravy, except that today there's no gravy, so the selection becomes even more limited. Interesting jelly situation. We were first offered fig, strawberry, or frog. \"Frog\" was described as sort of citrus. Then, we were told they were out of strawberry. The \"frog\" turned out to be good, berry and citrus flavor. They were also out of bagels and cream cheese. The poached egg and salmon was good. The omelette was goof but the onion dominated other flavors. The stone ground grits I thought would be great were served as though scooped with an ice cream scoop and, since they were room temperature at best, they retained that shape.  We've been there for lunch many times, though it's been a while, and were always very pleased with everything. Maybe they just had a bad day. Even the server seemed baffled by the lack of gravy, etc. and didn't seem to be happy to be there.  Very disappointing, but we'll be back during the week for the lunch menu."}
{"text":"Somehow i never even knew this place existed, yet Wife P. had a Groupon so she suggested it for a takeout lunch. This is my second time eating in this little area in the past week (other visit to Pinky's). After checking out their online menu we called in our order and it was ready nearly Chinese fast food fast.   We decided to order and split two sandwiches. We went with the Club and the meatloaf sandwich. Both were delicious with the winner being the meatloaf. Broccoli casserole and pimento cheese with chips for our sides. Both were delicious. For dessert, we ordered both the peanut butter pie and banana pudding. Both were delicious.   A delicious lunch paired with the magic of Groupon (where it feels like free money even though you already paid something for it) made for a wonderful experience.   It seemed like a cool space even though i just picked up a to go order. It will probably end up in the ever expanding we will return eatery options."}
{"text":"Savor is a great spot. Near uptown which is convenient but far enough out to have its own parking. Food is very good. Specials are always good. My favorite on the regular menu is the meat loaf. The meat loaf is good, mashed potatoes are good, & it comes with good vegetables. At most places unnamed vegetables are squash & zucchini. Here they are Brussels sprouts, green beans, carrots, & asparagus. I eat 1/2 & take 1/2 home for another meal. Desserts are excellent at Savor also. Services is excellent too - they are very accommodating."}
{"text":"But is it worth the wait?...  Food has always been delicious. Chicken and waffles and the salmon benedict are favorites.   But. The. Wait. It takes forever. The wait for brunch food tends to be about an hour after you order, which is pretty ridiculous when there are 8 people total in the restaurant. They really need to bring out complementary biscuits to hold people over because otherwise you just end up writing hangry reviews like so."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Savor previously and had as awesome experience. Great food, ambience, and our server was amazing. Today, we decided to give it a chance as well. I am not allowing the service we received from Tyesha to hinder my rating as the food was amazing as well as the nice gentleman behind the bar. However, our waitress was extremely short- almost as if she was rushing us out. Barely asked my husband if he needed anything and was very rude as she took our order. It was as if she was so ready to get off that she neglected to even look at us as we placed our order. Very passive aggressive; locking the door at 2:30 so nobody else would come in when they have 30 minutes until close. Her service was awful. However, the nice man behind the bar with the warm accent was splendid. The food was amazing. Quite possibly the best waffles I've had. I would definitely be back for mid-day cocktails and drink specials. However, I hope they work hard on training their staff to make the dining experience comfortable."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner after watching the Yelp segment on our local channel. The shrimp and Grits were the best I ever had. We followed the dinner up with not one but two of their amazing desserts Banana putting and Coca-Cola cake. We will be back soon they mention a Fish Fry Friday they are starting so might be this Friday!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday at 8 pm. Terrible service. Took 10 minutes to get drinks. Out of food special. Out of other menu items. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Love it here, I've come for lunch on several occasions. The food is always fresh and tasteful! I've had the sweet chili glazed salmon, blackened trout and their savor salad, all very delicious! The customer service is always great as well. I don't have anything bad to say about this place, even the dessert is good! Check them out!"}
{"text":"Omg literally just tried to give this place another try and stood at the front door waiting to be seated for 5 minutes and nobody came to help.... it's like nobody even cares about this place where are the owners?!?"}
{"text":"I've been a long time customer of Savor for many years. About 6 months ago, Savor changed management as well as renovated the restaurant and put in the patio. I remember that during that change over time, I was told that the new management would be keeping the old recipes and just add to them.   My review has two components - one for those who were familiar with Savor before the mgmt change and one that is just based on the food as it was served.   My boyfriend and I went for dinner on April 25th. I had checked out the menu online before we got there as I wanted to see what kind of new items they had. I saw listed spicy chicken and dumplings and was excited to try something new. When we got to the restaurant, the menu had tape over the chicken and dumplings. Okay, so not going to be trying something new. I ordered the salmon with chili glaze and mixed asian vegetables (something I've had many times before), and my boyfriend got the bone-in pork chop (something he's had many times before).    First component of my review - if you have been to Savor before and really like the food, be prepared that although you may be ordering the same menu items, the food is not going to be the same. Pork chop was not bone-in, and although it's supposed to be served with sage compound butter, it wasn't. My boyfriend also noted that the risotto that comes with it wasn't risotto anymore, but rice.  On my plate, all the components were the same, salmon, mashed potatoes, and vegetables, but the vegetables where totally drowned in a chili sauce, which previously, was just a glaze on the salmon only.   That brings me to the next component of my review - the food quality. My mashed potatoes were cold .... not warm, but cool to the touch. The chili sauce that covered the vegetables was hot, but it wasn't a good contract with horseradish mashed potatoes and chili sauce. My boyfriend said the pork chopped were cooked correctly, but the risotto was not.  If you really liked the 'old' savor, you might be disappointed. If you knew nothing about savor before the mgmt chain, then you might be okay with the food, although based on the cold potatoes, risotto not really being a true risotto (overcooked), and vegetables swimming in sauce, I'd give the food a 4.    Last point, the restaurant was practically empty, we were the only people sitting on the right side of the restaurant (side away from the bar), and our waiter disappeared for about 15 minutes after we finished eating, so we had to get up and go pay at the bar as he never came back to check on us after we were done eating."}
{"text":"Ok Ill admit I was a little frusrated by the cobbler covered by pecans I specfically asked not be anywhere near my cobbler or the container they put it in (allergenic reactions are no joke) but I received an apology and a nut free cobbler. I ordered mac and cheese qhile I waited on the cobbler redo and all I can say is Wow...and is my mom in the kitchen, I want a hug. It was delicious.  I didn't think I would be back but the mac n cheese changed my mind."}
{"text":"We had dinner here last night. The service was friendly, the portions were large, and the food was good. We started with the blue cheese dip. I didn't care for the dip because it had a strange taste to it. But the homemade  chips that came with it were really good, though.   For dinner, I had the meatloaf and my spouse had the chicken cutlet. They were both really good and we had plenty for leftovers. We both had sauteed seasonal veggies which were crisp and flavorful. I had horseradish mashed potatoes and he had the grits. We enjoyed the sides. Dessert was the coca cola cake. It came with two generous slice. They were moist and fudgey.  For an app, two beers, dinner, dessert, and a generous tip, we only spent $66 and had leftovers for lunch today. We'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Support the locals as it says on their entrance!  One of the owners Mike I have to say is a very personable guy! He's here all the time and you can't miss him he's very approachable and nice!   Food - My fiancé and I got fried chicken cutlet and hanger steak.  Though the hanger steak was good, nice and tender.  The real wow factor or \"pop\" was the fried chicken cutlet with pimento cheese and bacon. I mean what else can I say, as long as it was fried crispy as it was, top it with pimento cheese and bacon and it's money!! Their side dishes with the collards were good!  Fried pickles was good but a little greasy.  Dessert- peanut butter pie was MONEY as well, wow that w  Atmosphere- love the brick walls and the outside patio!  Lots of potentials for the outside patio with a great view of the skyscraper building.  Great local painting up for sale as well!   One thing would be the bar, not having a draught system. However they do carry a lot of cold craft and local bottles.   Hope to be back and again be sure to say hi to Mike, he's a cool guy!  **UPDATE** Wanted come back and update the catering side of Savor.  Of course Mike and his staff completely toke care of us during our event. We had our rehearsal dinner and through the whole process and before even before the event, Mike worked with us through it all!  We had a set menu, he made it special and customized to a our rehearsal dinner.  We had three options of entrees: Fried chicken cutlet, shrimp and grits, and the hanger steak.  We LITERALLY had our whole attendees debating on what was better equally between all three.  We had a few, such as myself and now wife order one of everything cause it was that good!  Would have had Savor do our wedding or heck there is also anniversaries!!  5 star all day and highly recommend anyone to give Savor a shot catering any of your events!   I want to thank Mike and his staff again and can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"We hit Savor Cafe at lunchtime.  It was pretty packed so we were directed to the bar area.  We ordered the Chicken & Dumpling special and a Cobb Salad.  The Chicken & Dumplings were so good I couldn't stop myself to eat the salad.  The Cobb Salad ended up being dinner at home (which is never quite as good as eating at the restaurant).  I definitely will go back to try other things...including their banana pudding...not sure how I even got out of there without trying it!!  Our only downside, the service was a tad slow towards the end when we were needing to get our check."}
{"text":"I recently discovered this little gem on the outskirts of downtown and wished I had found it sooner...having tried lunch and dinner there, I highly recommend this place!  Terrific selection of dishes on the menu.  They have fantastic burgers that are grilled and then finished in the oven, ribs, salads, and tasty sides.  The soul rolls are delicious and the butterscotch bread pudding is outstanding (the generous serving is large enough to be shared)."}
{"text":"This is one of the first places I ate at when I moved to Charlotte and after a year, it is still my favorite.  Some of my faves are: meatloaf, shrimp and grits and the blackberry-peach cobbler and the chocolate banana pudding is to die for! I'm not sure it is \"southern\" but just delicious.  There's something here for everyone and I've never brought someone here that didn't like their food or the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I would love to see the bar scene  here more vibrant .  Savor already has the perfect bartender, Toni, and amazing drink specials. There is no reason why the bar shouldnt be swarming with yuppies from the Wesley Heights, SouthEnd and 3rd ward neighborhoods! Savor only uses the freshest ingredients and their handcrafted cocktails are standout.  Wed: Half price martini's (my fave is the St. Germain: Champagne and St. Germain) Sat: $4 House Drinks (keep in mind their \"well\" isnt bottom shelf)  Thursday and Friday Savor offers wine and beer drink specials as well."}
{"text":"This is a pretty solid lunch spot. They have a great \"fresh\" menu. Always have pretty good specials offered.   I have had incredible food here, and I have also left here going \"eh\". So for me it has been hit or miss. Never terrible, but not consistently great either.   Their sandwiches are great, oh and house made strawberry lemonade is a wonderful thing. I've had a bbq chicken special once and was not impressed with the sauce or chicken. Was kind of dry.   Good lunch spot with co-workers, but be warned at peak lunch times it gets very crowded and loud. So if having a nice quiet discussion over lunch is your plan, don't come at peak hours.   Service is always super friendly, never had bad service here once.   Overall, more like a 3.5 stars. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I had the absolute best experience at Savor Cafe and Catering! My party of three evolved into a party of 15 and the staff was so welcoming and accommodating! Chaz answered all my questions and Samantha took great care of my family. The shrimp and grits were amazing and the banana pudding is a must! The Sweet Potato Biscuits and Deviled Eggs were sold out but I look forward to visiting again to take advantage of them as well as the DIY Bloody Mary and Mimosa bar. I'm already looking forward to going again!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this restaurant.  Everything I've had there has been really good.  Whatever you get as a meal, be sure to get the Asian vegetables as a side.  Delicious!  Oh and Thursday night is half priced bottles of wine."}
{"text":"We came in with a big party and they were already busy, but they made it work and asked whether we preferred to be split up and seated faster or wait longer for a table together. We chose the faster option and it seemed as though tables turned over pretty quickly.   I ordered the meatloaf entree. They were out of the broccoli casserole I'd originally ordered, so the server offered me cheesy cauliflower. I asked for a side salad instead since I was already getting mac n cheese and they gave it to me with no upcharge. Overall, it was good food - little twists on very traditional, comforting fare. I was pretty excited to take home leftovers and eat them again.   I had been here before for the mile high peanut butter pie and it was so good, I got it again to go. My coworker got the Coca Cola cake (mild chocolate flavor) though and regretted not going for the peanut butter or the peach blackberry crumble they had as a special."}
{"text":"Their mimosas were decent, not too sweet and mostly dry for those who don't like sweet drinks.  I forgot to take a pic of the main meal.  I had the Savor omelet with Mac and cheese and they were delicious!  Then last but not least, their Coca Cola chocolate cake pictured was amazing!  It was moist AND dense.    I came back today and the food came out cold.  Last time, my boyfriend's food was cold as well so I'm going to have to knock down a star for that until they up their game back.  We can tell the food would have been amazing if it was nice and hot."}
{"text":"I don't thing I've ever had a bad meal here... Unfortunately for me, I'm always feel like I can have two of whatever thing I order to satisfy me. Their salads are delicious and their sandwiches are great, I particularly like their wedge with candied pecans or the Cuban sandwich.  Here's where I'm gonna veer of from my norm: I'm not a desserts guy, but I would come here just for the caramel bread pudding.... It's crack on a plate. Their banana pudding has won awards as well... And their coca-cola cake is pretty darn good... Not many places can I say I love the desserts in Charlotte, but this is one of them.  Service here is good and the ambiance is casual. It's a great place for lunch."}
{"text":"I went to savor cafe for a double date with my girlfriend , her best friend, her best friends fiancé and their little daughter . When we first got there the waitress told us they didn't have enough high chairs for the baby to sit in because the other two were being used . We didn't have an issue because the baby is usually well behaved. We got seated , the waitress took our orders and everything was fine. Let's say we got there around 1:30 , the wait was horrible, he got our food at 3pm . Now, I don't know why it took so long because we all had salmon and it doesn't take that long to cook it. We finally got our food around 3pm and it was really good , everything was really tasty and fresh . I would come back but they need to work on their timing ."}
{"text":"Great food, casual atmosphere, awesome service. Tony was the best!!  Special flat iron steak was perfect. Salmon salad was delicious. Simple but well prepared. Went a little overboard on the desserts. Peanut butter pie was freaking awesome!!  Coconut cream pie was incredible too. Great place for a group bday dinner."}
{"text":"I came here because I saw it on Charlotte's top 25 places to eat in the magazine. I came for dessert only because I realized it was closer than I thought!!!  First off I really loved the decor when you walk in the room at a modern bright color decor and very clean. Then you walk in the other half it had a brick vintage look and was also very neat!  We ordered the Butterscotch breading & banana pudding after our waiter told us they are the best two in his opinion.  He said she makes them from scratch.  Let me tell you WOW was he right they were amazing!!!  I loved both of them equally.  If wondering which you should choose this might help.  The Banana pudding is cold and the Butterscotch breading pudding is hot and very rich!  Either way you cant go wrong. I honestly cant wait to go back and try the food and get more pudding!!! THIS IS A MUST GO PLACE IN CHARLOTTE!!"}
{"text":"I love Savor!  A friend took me for my birthday wow two years ago now, and I took my family a few months ago and they absolutely LOVE THE FOOD! The collard green rolls soooo yummy and the salmon cooked to perfection. Great place for family and friends, because it's small, intimate and so delicious!"}
{"text":"Tucked into a little space on the side of a building (though it has recently doubled in size), this cafe in the shadow of uptown is the home of pure deliciousness served with a healthy dose of Southern charm.  Throw your calorie budget out the window and just know the trade off for taste is worth it!  Now just where to begin?  Easy: True homemade Strawberry lemonade.  Now I'm usually the guy who goes for water and lets the food speak for itself.  Luckily my wife is just the opposite, and I'm the better for it.  Real bits of mashed up berry with that tart of the lemon- its the perfect play-off between sweet and sour, but you'll easily want seconds, and thirds.  Luckily they serve this stuff by the pitcherfull- now if only they'd just drop off and leave the pitcher at my table!  Dessert- Peanut Butter Pie.  Split an entree so you and a guest have room to try this.  Like others have said, it is lick the plate good.  Rich, creamy, and tons of PB flavor.  They also make a selection of a few other desserts everyday, you should give those a try too.  Butterscotch Bread Pudding?  Coca Cola cake?  Ridiculous good.  There are usually a number of specials on the chalk board on the wall- go for these.  Their dinner best seller, sometimes a lunch special, is the sweet chili glazed salmon.  Crispy with a sweet glaze that goes perfectly with the fish.  Salmon can go really wrong, but this always leave me wanting seconds.  The horseradish mashed potatoes that go on the side are also pretty good.  For lunch, I like almost all the sandwiches- The Farmers' Market is great- mozzarella and basil with fresh tomatoes drizzled with balsamic- a timeless combo that goes great between a couple thick slices of bread.  The Atom Bomb burger looks like it should have more kick than it does, could use some more spice for me.  Most dishes come with a side- so let me rave over the black-eyes pea salad.  Not sure what the dressing/sauce is they mix with the peas, but it's, again, bowl-licking good.    Service is non-fussy and pretty fast.  Lunch can get a little crowded at the peak, but otherwise you should be able to get in and out without problems.  Not much of a parking lot, but plenty of parking up the side street, just watch the signage and don't block entrance to any of the other lots.    If you like independent spots with a little daring and just a bit of edge to make it interesting, this is your place.  Bravo to Savor!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon a little past noon and it was pretty calm with a few other diners. Location is in a newly remodeled area. When we came in we were told we could sit wherever we pleased. They should get a sign telling people this. At times there was no front attendant and people appeared confused. As soon as we were seated our waiter came to take our drink order. He was nice, but as we placed the order there was limited items the restaurant had in stock on. They were out of biscuits, etc. we ended up ordering salads since it was what seemed available. The large proration salad wasn't as filling and they ran out of apples and cranberries and put strawberries without telling me they were out of this item before I placed my order. The food came out in a timely manner. We needed up order a bagel the only breaded items in stock. It was super doughy and cold. It was placed on a grill because it had grill marks and I guessed they placed it there so that it would warm it up. Epic fail. I wouldn't recommend this place and was so interested in it from the great ratings. Well maybe it was a bad day, but it isn't for me."}
{"text":"Just left the restaurant. I found a hair in my drink, my drink never got re-filled, and had to wait over an hour to get the food. Finally had to get the food to go. The food was cold and was the wrong order, she even gave me the wrong drink to begin with. Trying to call to speak to a manager but no one is picking up. The food is decent but the service was terrible."}
{"text":"Awesome! Great food. Great desserts. Good spot for work or a date. Have even brought kids (10+) and they liked food.  All is good, sides, specials."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great atmosphere. Excellent cocktails. Every part of our meal was excellent--we ordered drinks, appetizers, entrees, and three desserts. Could take a date here but also a family. The service was super accommodating of our kids. Will be back and will be spreading the word about this place!"}
{"text":"First of all, it is a disservice to this restaurant to identify it as \"southern.\" Its menu definitely has a southern flare, but it includes items that I would identify as New American and Asian fusion for sure. So many great options on the menu, but I chose to combine two items: the grilled salmon with Asian teriyaki grilled vegetables along with the country ham and lima bean risotto. Both were absolutely incredible, and I found myself with a completely clean plate at the end of the experience. More than anything, I appreciated the casual and fun atmosphere. I sat at the bar with several other customers, we all talked throughout our meal, and Tony the bartender was outstanding. And, of course, the ingredients were locally grown. Keep up the good work, Savor!"}
{"text":"For the location (.5 miles from my house), service, and food I think this place is 5 stars, easy. Is it my favorite Charlotte restaurant? No. But it's darn good food and friendly service; can't beat that.   I think I might be addicted to the salmon BLT. It's a doozy to eat but the flavors are worth the effort it takes. The veggie voodoo sandwich is also pretty tasty and the meat loaf is (what I consider to be) good, old fashioned meat loaf like gramma used to make. The root veggie hash and horse radish mashed potatoes are my favorite sides. I usually sub for those, whatever I order.   Last not but not least if you happen to be in on a day when they have their chocolate banana pudding: ORDER IT. I haven't seen it in quite sometime, but I had it once and I'm hooked. Otherwise, the mile high peanut butter pie is a nice alternative."}
{"text":"Prompted by my recently purchased Groupon, I tried Savor Cafe.  I would have never known the restaurant was there and that the food would have been so good.  I had the shrimp and grits, a beer and an appetizer of pimento cheese and homemade potato chips.  The flavors were excellent, portions generous and staff attentive without hovering.    The dining room is small and it's hard to escape the fact that you are dining in a strip-mall location.  If you are looking for a fine dining experience, this is not the place.  If you are looking for excellent food and service in a friendly environment, I encourage you to go to Savor.  You may see me there as it is now on my favorites list for Charlotte."}
{"text":"Just another restaurant in Charlotte with hype. I order the steak and it was horrible. I should have known, never order a steak if it's not a steak house. We also order the scallops and it was OK. Will go back to give it another taste."}
{"text":"Great place to try in charlotte.. Food is very diverse and good presentation... Very friendly staff and very helpful!!!"}
{"text":"Food was really good.  The service took way too long (and the place was empty).  The waitress apologised and spotted us a free dessert, but I would rather have gone elsewhere.   They seem to have kitchen to table issues.  Maybe deemed a Groupon place only."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  I've never had a bad meal here.  I will continue to enjoy the great southern style food."}
{"text":"Really good lunch.  Food seemed really fresh and carefully prepared (one of those places, where it comes out looking like the pictures!\"  I got the loaded burger with pimento cheese.  It was very filling.  I got the mac and cheese as a side."}
{"text":"I came here once for lunch and loved it. Not as much this last time for dinner. Could've been what I ordered though. I got a steak sandwich and it was pretty tough to eat, I had to swallow the meat whole. The last time I came was almost 2 years ago, I think my coworker had the same complaint. It was pretty quiet for a Friday night. According to the server, it's like that every night."}
{"text":"It had been a year since I last ate at Savor and I was eager to try the newly renovated restaurant. The interior was very nice and the atmosphere... ON POINT.  When we arrived the place had maybe 6 seated tables. We arrived at 600 pm and immediately placed our drink and app orders.  Within 45 minutes, we had our apps and they were delicious, as I remembered.  The entree took over an hour to reach our table and was mediocre. I ordered the Chicken and Dumpling, and was completely inedible.  The kitchen was so slow that management comp'd our apps and our cocktails.  I am a picky restaurantor and was not happy. There is no way that the meal pictured below should have taken over 1 hour to prepare, pulled chicken, one biscuit and a rue.  I surely hope that when the new condos are completed and occupied that this cook staff has their act together, cause no one will wait this long for this meal."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Although it's not in the best part of town and the building's exterior and interior could use a little renovation, I think it gives the place some character.   We didn't make reservations (and I'm not sure if they take them?), but we were just able to get in and get a table, but the place was definitely packed.  As we ordered and ate, I definitely found out why.  The food was absolutely incredible!  I ordered the Pork Chop over succotash and was tempted to order another as soon as I was done.  Despite how good my dish was, my wife ordered some type of Redfish entree that was even better.   Yeah, fish beats Pork for the first time in this guy's life.  I don't want to say it, but I think I have to... no I won't.  Ok, i'll say it - that was the best fish... wait no no no.... i won't say it.  Ok, here it goes: That was the best fish I have ever had.  I was born and raised on the coast of South Carolina.  I've been to Charleston, Hilton Head, Wilmington, all the way up to Jersey and New York, then aaallll the way west to San Francisco, LA, San Diego, then to the Bahamas, Mexico, Jamaica... and I've had many-a-fish perish in order to please my palate.  But no fish has ever pleased it like this one.  I don't know how they did it, but they did.  For dessert, we shared the banana pudding.  I was worried that something so simple would prove to be a let down, but it wasn't.  it was delicious as well.   Service was solid.  We received our food in a very decent amount of time, and the waitress was very knowledgeable and attentive.  I give her 2 thumbs up and 4-5 stars.    So overall, I can't think of anything negative about my experience.  I would pick on the aesthetics of the place, but I think they're investing their money where it needs to be, in quality food and ingredients and good service.  Other places I've been to do this completely backwards and make me want to punch faces. I'll return, hopefully often."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give Savor Cafe 5 stars but while the food was wonderful, there were some issues with the service. First, we had to ask for silverware for 6 of the 8 of us. I won't fault them on running out of the beer I originally ordered. It happens. But the server asked me if I wanted a 2nd beer of the brand I ordered as a replacement. 20 minutes later, I think it finally appeared.  And lastly, I ordered the Pork Tenderloin which is on the menu. I was looking forward to the southern flavors of this dish. After a long wait, someone comes out and tells me they over cooked my meal and it was the only one they had so I selected something else...a pork special...I really forget what it was advertised as.  I've watched enough cooking shows to know that these things happen. The good things about Savor are the food is incredible. The meal came out and it made me forget about my original order.  The pork fell off the bone and the veggies were tender also.  It was a very homey meal!  The Peanut Butter Pie for dessert looked too good to eat but I managed!  It was quite delicious.  Other people at my table had the Key Lime Pie and the Coca Cola Cake which I heard were also to die for.  Despite some problems, the staff gave me my entree for free and they made the effort to correct any issues.  I think they are definitely worth another shot."}
{"text":"Savor is close to where I work and is an easy and affordable lunch with business clients.  A little bit of everything on the menu- both portion wise and price-wise.  Staff is super friendly and helpful, but occasionally they are understaffed.  Cuban sandwich is surprisingly good, as are their burgers.  Their daily lunch specials always on point and their banana pudding with marshmellow topping is amazing."}
{"text":"Wow!!! What a great first experience! I saw the reviews on Yelp and decided...let's take a chance. This is a cool little spot. Server Meredith was super busy but oh so attentive . Great personality and recommendations were spot on! Nice vibe and great food! I have driven by it hundreds of times...didn't know it was there. I do now! Salmon...delish...Shrimp n Grits...same! 1/2 price wine on Thursday BFF! That peanut butter pie though!!!! Yes!!! Well done!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh dear. I went to Savor with 5 other people- we all ordered different items to try from. 4 out of 6 meals were average to below average. I had the shrimp and grits. Very tasty (not the best shrimp and grits, but def. worth trying). The appetizers were tasty. They teased us- making us think that our main courses would be better. My friend ordered the saddest sandwhich that I have ever seen. It was limp. The presentation was terrible. We left the restaurant very disappointed. I don't foresee any of us going back.  The ambiance is adorable. It sort of reminds me of a restaurant that you would find in Brooklyn. The chairs didn't really fit the style of the restaurant- but I kind of like that. I think sometimes Charlotte is too \"perfect\".  It is gay friendly- always a plus.  I doubt we will go back. It is out of the way for us and none of us were wow'd."}
{"text":"Oh, Savor Cafe. I'd been hearing such great things about you but hadn't had a chance to stop in until a Friday night two weeks ago when my cousins were in town. Everything I'd heard was true - you have great southern style food at reasonable prices.   On to the menu:  1. Drinks - get the strawberry lemonade. If you need an adult beverage, get the strawberry lemonade with vodka in it. Do not miss out on this deliciousness.  2. Dinner - on our table we had two orders of the pan fried pimento cheese chicken and one order of the chili salmon. Both were unbelievably good. And the horseradish mashed potatoes and collards (with smoked turkey instead of bacon for flavor) were also top notch.  3. Dessert - we went for a trio of desserts to share. The peanut butter pie (creamy and delectable), the cobbler with ice cream (quite good), and the banana pudding. Now, I am not much of a banana pudding fan, but OH.MY.GOODNESS. was it good. By far the best dessert of the three. And I'm a huge peanut butter pie fan, so that's saying a lot. Get the banana pudding. Just do it.   Next time I'm in the mood for southern vittles, I'll be heading your way, Savor. Not low fat, but totally worth the splurge."}
{"text":"Savor Cafe and Catering, located on West Morehead St., is a cute spot for a tasty lunch or dinner. I recently dined in for dinner and we enjoyed prompt and attentive, but not overbearing service - thumbs up! The shrimp & grits, pictured above, was one of the best items I tried. The meat loaf was also very good as was the famous banana pudding. The soul rolls were crispy but I didn't find them to be as noteworthy as I expected. It would be great if the chef created a variation on the standard chili sauce to go with these, as part of the disappointment was tasting a sauce that comes right out of a bottle. The pad thai was sweeter than usual and definitely a different take if you are used to the traditional Thai variety. On my next visit I would like to try the blue cheese and bacon dip and I look forward to trying the salads, lunch sandwiches and more desserts - in particular the mile high peanut butter pie and the cobbler, which changes daily! Savor is a great addition to West Morehead and I look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Wow delicious!   I took Nicole's advice and went with the strawberry lemonade ...wow, talk about a great summer refreshment!They even offered me 2nd refill as I left (since I was getting carry-out) - proactive service- and friendly to boot!   I didn't have time for a full meal so I went for a sandwich - (there are only three on the dinner menu) so they let me scope out lunch as well. I decided on the dinner mojo chicken sandwich based on recommendation.  The sandwich was so flavorful! The marinade reminded me a lot of Speedy sauce (for those upstate New Yorkers). I didn't really taste the avocado in the spread but it was a great accompaniment no less. I had a veggie mix of brussell sprouts, carrots, and asparagus - all were roasted with a slight crunch : )  ...  I went to crisp the next day and it simply couldn't compete.  I will be back soon- as in maybe today !"}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place. The waitress was super nice and accommodating; she did all she could. The problem was the food/whatever the kitchens problem is. Absolutely insane. Didn't have a whole hamburger entree, 3 different sides, bacon, or almost anything we tried ordering. We were told \"we are out of that\" more than we were told they had it. We came an hour and 15 mins before closing too. My boyfriends order came out with two sides missing, and we had to ask about them to receive them. His plate literally came out with poached eggs and some sort of hash. My $16 entree was 1 side, an English muffin, one poached egg, and a patheticly small amount of salmon. That's it. Lol. Not worth the prices at all. Sadly, won't ever go back!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of good things about this place so I might give this place another chance. Came in on a saturday night and they weren't busy at all. They had $5 sangrias on special. Score!   My husband got the burger with collard greens. He found 2 pieces of plastic in his burger. They were like the material of a plastic zip lock bag. His burger was over cooked. I got the salmon blt with macaroni. The server told that I can get it if it's still available from lunch. I never heard anything else and saw that I was served the macaroni. It did not look good at all. The sauce was water.....yellow water. It wouldn't even stick to the noodles. The noodles were bland and not delicious at all. Everyone at the table said the macaroni looked bad and almost looked scraped from the bottom of the pan or that it looked microwaved. My salmon blt was good, but lacked flavor. The bread was good though.   My friend got the trout and ate the whole thing. My other friend got the hummus and really enjoyed it. The shrimp and grits looked really good so I might try that if I ever go back."}
{"text":"It's been a very long time since I was as pleasantly surprised with a dinner as I was with Savor. When we left Arkansas for Virginia, we stopped in Charlotte for a few days to visit with our families. One night while we were home, my in-laws took us out to dinner. They suggested Savor. I had never heard of it, but a quick glance at their menu online had my interest piqued.  The restaurant is small, and it didn't help that half of the dining area was occupied with a rehearsal dinner. Luckily there was one table available. Once we were seated, our adorable waiter took drink orders. He was seriously adorable. Pretty eyes, pretty smile, nice arms in his tight black shirt...  *ahem*  Anyways... They had a nice selection of local beers, which is apparently the hot thing these days. I'm not a beer drinker, so I ordered a cocktail, the 'Southern Special-Tea'. It was a concoction of Firefly Sweet Tea Vodka, Southern Comfort, iced tea and freshly squeezed lemonade. It was absolutely delicious and the southern girl in me appreciates anything served out of a mason jar.  Their menu was small, but impressive. It was difficult to choose a dish. Graham and his mom both ordered the meatloaf. My father in-law ordered one of their specials (a rib-eye) and I finally decided on the Cowboy Pork Chop over Country Ham & Succotash Risotto.  Oh. My. God. This was absolutely phenomenal. The pork chop was tender and had amazing flavor, and the risotto was probably the best risotto I have ever, ever had. The flavor was phenomenal and I wanted about ten more plates of it to take home with me. The risotto is DEFINITELY something I'm going to have to recreate at home!  The meatloaf that Graham and his mom ordered was just as fantastic. The portions were huge! The meatloaf was grilled and served with a tangy pepper relish and served with horseradish mashed potatoes and sauteed vegetables. Everything on that plate was delicious. The potatoes just had the hint of horseradish, and the vegetables were perfectly cooked. They still had a bite to them, and were well seasoned. But the meatloaf... oh man. Probably the best meatloaf I've ever had. It was so moist and flavorful.  We were stuffed after finishing our meals, but having stared at their dessert menu all night made ordering something sweet a definite. Graham and I decided to split an order of the butterscotch bread pudding.  I've never been a huge fan of bread pudding, but this was epic. The portion for this, like the rest of our food, was huge but I'm not embarrassed to say that we finished it all. The texture of this was amazing, and the flavors all worked so well together. We were generous and let the rest of our party have a bite, and they were equally impressed.  This was a fantastic dinner, at a great, hidden spot in Charlotte. The West Side has never really been known for fine dining, but I'm happy to see that's starting to change. Our experience at Savor was wonderful. The food was amazing, the service was fantastic, and the portion sizes for the amount of money we spent was just awesome. I mean, that massive plate of meatloaf and sides that Graham ordered was $11.50! Crazytown!"}
{"text":"Still drool worthy, always solid and super friendly service...this is Savor Cafe.   In my past review I discussed the deliciousness in the mile high peanut butter pie, farmer's sandwich, strawberry lemonade and mac 'n cheese. Rest assured, these menu items are just as delightful today! But, it's worth noting the following...  1) The addition (bar area) is excellent. More tables, both high tops and standard height and a really great looking bar.   2) That being said, there's a cocktail menu, now! And oh my is it tasty. The drinks are seasonal but super fresh and delightful. I had a berry mojito that was strong but really flavorful!   3) For a while, I only hit up Savor Cafe for lunch. I branched out and tried the salads - the Cobb is by far my favorite. Ridiculously fresh and packed with everything a Cobb should be!  4) And then I started dropping by for an occasional dinner. Um, shrimp and grits, FTW! Creamy, dreamy cheese grits topped with magnanimous shrimp. And do yourself a favor and check out the dinner (and dessert specials). I've had a fantastic scallop dish with black rice followed by a mixed berry cobbler that was out of this world.   5) Lastly, if you ever see the coconut cake listed as a special dessert, get it. Get the whole cake. It rivals the best coconut cake I've ever had (in Charleston). Amazing. I salivate just thinking about it.   Hungry? Go to Savor Cafe."}
{"text":"Savor Cafe is a weekly lunchtime destination for me. The food is delicious and the staff super friendly.  My two go-to lunch menu items are the Cobb Salad (good sized, the model all Cobb salads should strive to be) and the Sweet Chili Glazed Salmon. For dinner... get the Shrimp and Grits. You're welcome in advance. You can also never go wrong with their daily specials.  Make sure you save room for dessert. Five words that will change your life: Mile High Peanut Butter Pie. I have no will power so I usually add this at the last minute when I pick up my to go order. I find it's easier to justify getting it by telling myself \"well you did order a fresh, healthy salad.\"  Another must have is the strawberry lemonade. It's amazing. I avoid ordering it when I sit down to eat there, in fear I'll drink 12 and develop diabetes.  We've also used Savor for catering here at ye old TV station. Always a great meal and satisfying experience all the way around.   Great local business doing great things. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Average food for the price. Nice place and they were understaffed but we ordered what was recommended and weren't impressed...."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I did not have a great first experience at Savor Cafe. We stopped by for lunch on a weekday. We waited to be seated, and there were several open tables. We also waited over 45 minutes to get our food. The food was alright, but each meal had something wrong with it. Meal 1: The kettle chips were delicious, but they were cold. Meal 2: The Blue Cheese Dressing had NO flavor at all. Meal 3: The bottom bread on the sandwich was soggy like it had been sitting for a while. We also ordered the banana pudding for dessert. We checked Yelp while at the restaurant to see the reviews. Several people recommended the banana pudding. It was sub-par, and I was not particularly fond of the charred fluff on top. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Best banana pudding in Charlotte!  Servers are friendly and southern, food is very good.  Be sure to ask about the specials, they often source these from King's farmers market.  They are also happy to share their secret ingredients on the banana pudding, salad dressing, etc."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times now and it's always great! Food, atmosphere and service are always fantastic! You can tell the chef really cares what comes out of the kitchen. Definitely one of my favorite spots in the city. Great date spot too :)"}
{"text":"This place is so good!! Tried it on a Saturday and came back days later because we wanted to try more things on the menu! Must try: bread pudding, meatloaf, chicken something with bacon and something!! Just amazing."}
{"text":"A true gem. Went their last night for the first time and the food and service were unbeatable. Try the Banana Puddin'... May be the best thing I have ever eaten!"}
{"text":"The meatloaf really is amazing. However, after a recent lunch visit I noticed two separate charges from Savor Cafe on my banking statement. I called the restaurant and over the course of several weeks tried to work with the owner to have the second (and much higher) incorrect charge removed. Eventually another employee of the restaurant called me and assured me she was going to process a manual refund since they were unable to reverse the original incorrect charge. Instead of refunding my money the restaurant charged me again for the incorrect amount. Am now having to work with my bank to have the two charges reversed. Will never eat at this restaurant again and advise anyone who does to ensure they are only charged once for their meal.  It is a shame that the friendly staff and wonderful food at Savor Cafe are not enough to compensate for their horrible business practices."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try the Salmon BLT for months, This was definitely on my must have list for my visit to Charlotte and it did not disappoint! I hope to hit this spot again before I leave town!   I got there a little late tonight and Reid was so nice and welcoming, I offered to get the food to go to not hold them up and he graciously told me that was not necessary.   Mile High Peanut Butter pie I got to go had me in a food coma.   MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Our group of 3 came to Savor for Sunday brunch but would probably stick to dessert only from now on. There was only 1 server working and it took a long time for our food to arrive. When it did arrive, the Cuban sandwich had ingredients on it that were not listed on the menu. Our server was apologetic but didn't waive the fee from our bill, despite having to send the sandwich back to the kitchen. He did, however, bring us a complimentary $3 mimosa. Overall, it was not our best brunch experience.   All that being said, Savor will forever be a favorite spot for peanut butter pie in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"We got salads for dinner. They were quite tasty, but we got them so we would feel ok about getting the peanut butter pie. I will make this statement...Do whatever you need to do to justify getting dessert. The peanut butter pie was AMAZING. If I could eat this everyday and not gain a pound, I would. It's light, airy, creamy, decadent....like a peanut butter cheesecake, but so light.   The salads, they were large and tasty but I feel like I can't review a place on a salad, but the dessert was worth the trip alone!"}
{"text":"Collard green spring rolls and horseradish mashed potatoes were an excellent start to the Adam Bomb burgers"}
{"text":"I will forever give this place 5 STARS!!!! Excellent food, excellent staff and I just feel at home here! Prices aren't bad and I promise you, it's rewarding! The food is some of the best I've had in the Queen City. I love this place and I highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Meh, my first time here today and I wasn't thrilled. Maybe I just had really high expectations. I'm definitely going to come back and try some other things on the menu that I saw floating around the restaurant. I ordered the pesto chicken salad for my meal. I really liked the multigrain bun that it came on. It tasted very fresh. The chicken salad however was bland to me and the flavor of the pesto with the grapes and the pecans just did not mesh to me. It was also very dry and crumbly and kept falling out of the sandwich. I got coleslaw for my side and I didn't even eat it. There was something on top, I'm thinking celery salt maybe? Just not a flavor that I enjoyed and it tasted very salty. I got the banana pudding for dessert and that was just way too sweet for me. I normally like bold and interesting flavors so I don't think I was being sensitive. I saw some really good looking homemade potato chips, cheese grits, and a club sandwich that looked pretty good. The best part about my lunch was actually my coffee which tasted awesome and was served in a huge mug. The service was kind of slow even though it was after the lunch rush. I'll give it one more shot."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place. But I've been here twice now with issues both times.  First time I came here my parents brought me for my birthday. The food we got was good, pimento cheese dip, shrimp n grits, and my burger was excellent. The service however was terrible, it was as if we were an inconvenience since shortly after we came in a table of what I can only assume were the waiters friends came in and that is where he would remain for the rest of our meal. It took ages to order or to get refills or anything because he was so distracted. Note: we were the only other table in there. I'm not high maintenance when it comes to service but this was ridiculous. And to add I didn't think the banana pudding was very good. Waaaaayyy too sweet for me.  Second time the service was wonderful, though we we got there later in the night and were the only table there. She was really sweet, food was delivered promptly, drinks never went empty, but the food left a lot to be desired. It started off good with the deviled eggs, which oddly came accompanied by a dark nut sort of bread and jam. Confusing to say the least. My dude ordered the spicy chicken and dumplings which really just tasted like chicken shreds in gravy poured over a little biscuit with a kick. And it was $16 bucks for that. No side, no DUMPLINGS, just a biscuit (he said tasted frozen) in there in lieu of dumplings. When normally you would get both. Disappointing and he was still starving afterwards. I ordered the burger I had remembered so fondly and it was not nearly as good as the memory. It came out over cooked from the medium rare that I ordered which would have been fine if the meat was seasoned properly but it was pretty bland. The pimento cheese I paid extra to add was barely noticeable in flavor or otherwise.   As I said I wish I liked it but unfortunately it's just going to be added to my long list of mediocre restaurants in Charlotte. Womp womp."}
{"text":"So this is my absolute favorite lunch spot. If anyone ever asks me where  do I want to go to lunch, it is always this spot. I go s much the wait staff knows me. They are super casual and fun. I always grab a creative loafing newspaper and look up at the board to see what is the special. It never lets me down. My go to is the salmon BLT. Ohhh and the banana pudding..."}
{"text":"Another on the list of \"Best\" burger places in Charlotte.  Kind of hard to find if you aren't looking out for it, you can drive right by.  I stopped in for lunch on Saturday.  It wasn't very busy with about 4 or 5 other tables.  I ordered the burger with caramelized onion and a slice of Swiss cheese along with the standard setup of lettuce & tomato.  For my side I opted for the kettle chips    My food came out within a reasonable amount of time and the burger and chips looked tasty.  The burger was juicy and cooked to just a little over medium.  The kettle chips were crunchy and tasty.  The only thing that would make them better would be if they were hot and fresh from the fryer.  The burger had an OK flavor and they were kind of skimpy on the caramelized onions, but overall a good burger.    I'd usually have a beer with my lunch, but decided to skip it and have dessert instead as the ones listed looked very good.  My server was very good, keeping my glass filled.  For dessert I had the butterscotch bread pudding.  It was delicious and the reason for 4 stars instead of 3.  The portion size was huge, more than enough for 2 people to share.  As far as best burger,   I probably wouldn't order the burger next time, but try some of the other entrees as they looked very good.  The excellent service and great desserts will bring me back though."}
{"text":"I had recently read a lot of good reviews of this place from fellow Yelpers. Since it was the only restaurant part of Yelp restaurant week that was close enough to work to go to for lunch, we decided it was a good reason to check it out. I'm so glad we did -- it was awesome.   It wasn't very crowded at lunch so we were able to be started right away. There were so many things I wanted to try on the menu, but we decided to go with the Adam Bomb burger and the True Southerner sandwich. They were both delicious. The burger was actually cooked medium rare how I ordered it which almost never happens. The True Southerner was very filling and a great combination. The fried were delicious and the Mac and cheese was pretty good too. You could tell they really care about the quality of the ingredients.   We decided to all split the banana pudding, peach berry cobbler, and butterscotch bread pudding for dessert. I thought the bread pudding was dry and was disappointed by it. The other two were amazing though. The banana pudding was probably the best I've had.   This place is operating under the radar in Charlotte! I highly recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"I am sad to report that one of my once-favorite restaurants in Charlotte is not the same Savor I had often referred to as \"Charlotte's best kept secret.\"  My boyfriend and I went on a Saturday night for a dinner date.  Things started off great- the hostess/waitress was very pleasant.    I ordered the pan-seared chicken cutlet which came with collards and diced root vegetables.  He got the steak which came with mashed potatoes, asparagus, and a complementary long blonde HAIR.  That's right, a hair was in his dish that looked to match the food runner's.  Working in food and bev for years, I know this stuff is bound to happen from time to time and we both had a good laugh about it.  What we were not laughing about, was how the management at Savor handled this disgusting surprise.    My boyfriend, who is the size of an NFL player, was given a little garden side salad while I ate my meal before it went cold.  The chicken was amazing but unfortunately, the potatoes were so under cooked that they were hard and could not be eaten.  By the time his replacement steak was brought out sans hair, my plate was clean (minus the rock-tatoes) so he had to eat while I watched.  Not our idea of a romantic date night.  Of course we do not go out to dinner trying to get free meals, but what really surprised us is when the check came we were charged the full amount for a hairy dinner that we had to watch each other eat instead of enjoying together.  The waitress did comp one round of our drinks, however.  I would definitely think twice about going back to Savor again."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food. I had a burger with blue cheese and a side of the kettle chips. I give the food 4 out of 5. The strawberry lemonade was good, too. The service and atmosphere put this place at a 5. Light and airy but still cozy."}
{"text":"I love this hidden gem.  It is just off the beaten path so it isn't overly bombarded.  I don't know much about the history of this restaurant but I know they kick out a good product and the name says it all...I wanted to savor every bite!  I went with the chicken cutlet that was covered with pimento cheese and bacon.  It was pan fried and had a nice texture.  It was crispy but not all bread--it was a nice plump piece of chicken!  It came with 2 sides and this is where they lost me a bit...One was a root veggie \"hash\" so I was picturing more of a casserole style dish but instead it was diced up beets, sweet potatoes and some type of squash I believe.  IT was okay but I really only picked out the sweet potatoes.  The second item was what they call \"drunken collards\" and it was not good.  The server told us they were the \"best\" side on the menu and maybe I just came to realize I don't like collard greens but this dish was not for me.  It was very tart and it had bacon pieces mixed in but it still didn't cut it for me.  There were other sides to choose from so I wish I went in a different direction but that is just personal preference.   Husband ordered the burger which was about as unadventurous as you can get but he thoroughly enjoyed it!  It was served with kettle chips that were also very good.  I like the menu at Savor because they really have a good variety.  You can order fish, chicken, burgers, salads or pad thai!  They have homemade desserts that are divine!  I have tried the Coca Cola chocolate cake and it was absolutely wonderful.  It is super rich and they use the coca-cola to give it the nice fluffy texture.  It is not for the faint of heart.  You have to be in it to win it with this dessert but it is totally worth it!!  The service is friendly and the atmosphere is intimate.  I would say almost a little too close for comfort on some of the seating arrangements.  I mean we were sitting RIGHT up on the people to our left and right.  I guess if Charlotte is going to keep trying to act like NYC then we have to get used to this type of seating.  :)  Overall--great place, nice people, not an overly dramatic scene, easy, low key, affordable and so good.  I support them!"}
{"text":"As previously mentioned, save room for dessert.   The space is great - a good mix of table sizes and heights, bar seating, exposed brick, and the nicest staff. Also, although amidst the lunch rush my water was continually refilled, even if it was only two inches below the rim, amazing.   After finishing my plate of the bbq chicken sandwich (very delicious, and a little messy) with pepperjack mac n cheese (fairly flavourless) and my friend clearing his plate of shrimp and grits (think he might have wanted to lick it clean) I was satisfied, but as we were getting the check he ordered the banana pudding... I have to say it wiped away every memory of that sorry side dish and created this whole new ideal in my mind for banana pudding (goodbye old vanilla wafer recipe). I would sit here and describe it but do yourself a favor - get in your car, and go eat one.   I will be returning as a lot of other items on the menu sounded delicious, but I may just order three courses of dessert."}
{"text":"Love the menu options! Knowing they source locally, everything is fresh and always delicious. A quaint spot, that I need to enjoy more often. Don't forget to save room for dessert, all delish!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here numerous times & the food is usually pretty good. HOWEVER, yesterday was a bad experience. I walked in the door & waited 5 minutes, not one person even acknowledged my existence. My friend walked in to join me. We waited another few minutes, nothing. Yes, they were busy but I made eye contact with at least 4 servers & not one of them greeted me. That came across as very rude. We left & walked to Picante where we got served immediately. Will I ever go back to Savor? It's doubtful. I work hard for my money, if they don't want my business there's hundreds of other restaurants that do. Savor, your food is pretty good but your customer service needs some serious attention!"}
{"text":"Stopped into Savor on a Friday afternoon with some co-workers for lunch. We arrived just a little after noon and dining room was crowded.  We were seated quickly at one of the two open tables and began perusing the menu.  I chose the chicken salad sandwich with veggie casserole as my side.  One of my co-workers ordered the mojo chicken sandwich and the other ordered the egg roll appetizer as her entree.  Our food arrived fairly quickly (I don't believe it was more than 15 minutes).  I really enjoyed my chicken salad.  I am no fan of mayo and I was happy when my server had informed me that their salad did not use mayo.  The salad was accompanied by the veggie casserole.  I was happy to find the casserole was rather light with the veggies in a bechamel-type sauce with bread crumbs on top.  It was delicious.  My co-workers both enjoyed their meals as well.    We decided to order dessert in part, because of what I had heard on yelp regarding the peanut butter pie.  But along with the pie, we also got the blackberry-peach cobbler.  The cobbler, by far, was the supreme dessert that day.  The peanut butter pie looked pretty, but it just didn't match up to the fruity goodness of the cobbler.  Service was excellent, and while the prices were a little on the high side, the quality justified the cost.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Savor. While I enjoyed my food, I was underwhelmed by the atmosphere and service.   We had a reservation, but stood awkwardly in the entrance waiting to be seated. Other reviews say you can seat yourself, but the hostess (who also served as waitress) told us we could only sit on one side.   It was silent in the restaurant. No one was talking to each other and a movie was on. I had seen a picture of a cocktail on their Yelp, but when I asked the waitress she said there was no drink menu but she could try to make something... appreciate the effort but not convincing.   She kept our drinks refilled constantly and brought the things we requested quickly.   My entree was very good. My friends weren't pleased. Sides are a small portion, so I wouldn't pay the $3 to add or order an extra. I feel like the entrees were about $3-5 overpriced personally.   The peanut butter pie was great!"}
{"text":"Great little spot with wonderful staff, the salmon and meatloaf were excellent if basic (but in a good way) drinks were nice and varied but the main thing was the bread pudding. Best I've ever had. Only complaint is the live music was way too loud and they were out of a lot of appetizers. I'll come for another try if only for dessert!!!"}
{"text":"if you go in ask for tony as a server he is AMAZING! ive never had a bad dish at this place. delicious food. blue cheese dip is so good. burgers are outstanding. salads are delish. shrimp and grits are yum too. the desserts are out of this world!! try the peanut butter pie, coconut pineapple cake, bread pudding... all at one time..kidding but they are so delish!! this is an awesome spot with fabulous service and delicious food. try it! :)"}
{"text":"Dessert only: So the first time we ordered takeout from here, we just got the infamous butterscotch bread pudding for $6.50. We were a little disappointed to find it was very dry and dense. I prefer an airy, moist bread pudding. I should have gone with the pineapple coconut cake. But, glancing at the menu, everything sounded delicious. Will have to try out the entrees!"}
{"text":"How cute is this place? It used to be half the size it is now, I'm SO glad they were able to expand! Now they have a bar (with fountain sodas, yay no more cans!) and also a lot more dining space. I'm so pleased to see that this place has been so successful because the owner and staff are so awesome and hard working!  Savor is a delicious and affordable place that's a little more 'gourmet' without the snobby attitude or stuffy atmosphere that sometimes  accompanies those types of restaurants.  The wait staff is fantastic, we've always had the best service. Typically when I ask for a recommendation from the menu I brace myself for the \"well, this one ::points:: is good/okay/fine.\" But all of their waitstaff seems very knowledgeable when it comes to their menu, the way dishes are prepared, and what you're most likely to swoon over according to your tastes.  I don't think I've ever gotten anything I didn't like! I've had their burgers, meatloaf, almost all of their appetizers and over half of their dessert menu (the coca cola cake and, of course, peanut butter pie come highly recommended!).   I've only been for dinner, but I've heard their lunch is great too. The only negative I could mention is that they have a bit of a quirk in their schedule. I've had a hard time remembering that they are closed on Sunday, and open for lunch only on Monday and Tuesday.   **My favorite from this restaurant: Blue Cheese and Bacon Dip. Seriously. So. Good. I get it every time I go!"}
{"text":"Great little restaurant just off of 77 and Morehead Street, walking distance to Bank of America Stadium. Wife and I dined here today and the food was terrific. We started with a delicious blue cheese, bacon and spinach dip (the kettle cooked chips are delicious!). My wife had a veggie sandwich with portabello mushrooms that was yummy and I had a very good burger with pimento cheese and apple smoked bacon that was delicious. We brought home some tasty sounding desserts (peanut butter pie and coca-cola cake), but haven't eaten them yet. I have no doubt they'll be delicious as well. Cozy atmosphere and friendly wait staff made for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Each entrée was superior in flavor and desserts are not to be avoided. A gem in Charlotte. A well kept secret. This is a real find. 5 star food. I had the shrimp and grits. Others had the meatloaf, the burger and the porkchop. Desserts were as good as the entrées. Don't miss the butterscotch bread pudding...yum"}
{"text":"While I lived around the corner from Savor, I can't believe I never wrote up a review. What was I thinking?!  So what's to say that hasn't been said? A Southern restaurant serving up Pad thai? How can you not appreciate that? Friendly staff, excellent and I mean excellent burgers, amazing desserts, Savor cafe is a gem and one of the QC's finest.   Take my advice. Take your visitors to triceratops totin' spot to show off C-town's hipness, then stop at Savor cafe on the way home for some good food."}
{"text":"We really liked this little, comfy place!  Took a walk on Morehead St and discovered it.  It was great to see the Yelp decal on their window.  Saturday afternoon lunch, good variety/options, pleasant service, 'real food'(not processed/packaged), nice decor and, a clean restroom.  Just all around a great find!"}
{"text":"We loved our first visit to Savor. Had a late lunch and everyone enjoyed their food tremendously. I had a yummy Cuban sandwich that was correctly pressed on the right bread which is key. Light yet crusty. The rest of the group had the mojo chicken and club sandwiches and we all tried various sides to share including black eyed pea salad, tossed salad, coleslaw and the casserole of the day which was zucchini and squash and was just excellent. We shall return to savor more Savor!"}
