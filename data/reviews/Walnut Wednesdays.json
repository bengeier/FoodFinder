{"text":"This event was about 2 blocks from our hotel so we decided to give it a try. Our only disappointment is that we were so full from our nachos that we couldn't sample other options (!) A large variety of food trucks make it so there was something for everyone. It would be fun to see some activities (yard games like cornhole have been offered at similar events where we live), but we enjoyed people watching just as well."}
{"text":"I love going here on Wednesdays with co-workers. Bring cash for faster service but most places take cards with no problem. There are usually 20 or more food trucks there with everything from pizza to tacos, wings, BBQ, salads, burgers, sushi, gyros, and even a few bakeries with delectable little cupcakes. I recommend heading over at 11:15 to get there before the lines pile up and to get a good spot to eat outside. There is usually musical entertainment and a few reps from various sports teams there to pass out freebies!

My favorite place to get lunch at WW is Fired UP Taco Truck. They have the best empanadas ever! I'm so not exaggerating. I recommend the chorizo mac and cheese one. It definitely hits the spot."}
{"text":"We have always wanted to go and finally decided to take the leap. While it was jammed with food trucks- mostly taco or Mexican, or BBQ and burger--- my kids were not impressed. The while set up is fab and the crowds were easy to navigate. However, there was not much of an assortment as far as diverse offerings. I blame the fact that my kids eat all different types of cuisines all the time and have basically run out of unique foods to try . 
As far as I am concerned, while I will eat anything at any time, I do wish there was sometime more compelling than the aforementioned.  Fun experience and will try it again. Maybe next time they will have something a little different ."}
{"text":"Walnut Wednesdays have eliminated my mid-week slump!

I LOVE walnut Wednesday. There are so many food options. It is a little intimidating to walk into at first but I did not have to wait long for my food! 

It's also great that this is located within a 10 minute walk of my work. I love this event and I love that it gives Clevelanders a chance to mingle. Being able to experience some of 
Cleveland's best food in such a convenient way is so nice!"}
{"text":"So happy to finally make it here! There are a ton of options (probably 15 or so) and it's definitely popular. The organizers do a nice job with extra tables and live music too. 

There aren't too many healthy options and there is an abundance of tacos, tacos, tacos. It's perfect for a working lunch though and definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This is a weekly round up of about 20 food trucks.

Go there.  Order food.  Eat.

Rinse and repeat."}
{"text":"Yay!! So glad Walnut Wednesday has started up again. It already seems bigger than last year. There were at least 20 trucks there this Wednesday. Great variety of cuisines and all that I've tried so far have been awesome. You really can't go wrong. A few of my favorites are Fired Up, The Manna Truck, Wok and Roll, and Krave, but seriously, you can't really go wrong. I also noticed a lot more vegan/vegetarian options which I really appreciate. Only downside is the long, long lines, which makes the lunch hour go fast but its worth the wait."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Cleveland summer activities!  About 20 food trucks can be found here every Wednesday during the summer.  Want Swensons?  They're here!  How about a wood-fired pizza?  Yep, it's here too!  Sno cone?  Burrito?  Cupcake?  Gourmet Coffee?  Here also!  Pretty much whatever food you're craving, you'll find at Walnut Wednesdays.  They also have live music and other entertainment so it's a fun place to hangout for an hour or two.  There are plenty of benches and places to sit and enjoy your food but it does get busy.  If you can, bring a picnic blanket to sit on the ground and enjoy your food and some people watching.  I always find a metered parking spot nearby but there are some reasonable priced surface parking lots nearby."}
{"text":"Mama I made it! I finally made it! after hearing my coworkers rant and rave about this awesome \"walnut Wednesday's\" I said IM IN! And boy am I glad. 

It's on East 12th and Walnut (see what they did there?) and it's about 20 or so food trucks. It runs from 11:30-1:30 so make sure you gauge your time right!

Everything from Taco trucks to pizza mobiles to desserts. It really is a free for all and you can probably find just about any type of food you might be craving. 

The lines aren't as long as I would expect, and 90% of the trucks take credit cards which is a huge plus! Get there early because parking is just like anywhere else in downtown Cleveland IMPOSSIBLE!  I'm not sure if they operate rain or shine but I sure hope so cause I would get soaked to have these food options again.  My only little minor gripe is that I wish there was more tables available, that's more so on the city of Cleveland and not the food truck owners but I thought I should put it out there that there is very limited seating if you plan on soaking up some sun 

I went with the good ole fired up taco truck and I wasn't disappointed. Three tacos for $10, can't beat that.  I wanted to try the donut truck as well but their line was too much for me, I will definitely be back though it's definitely a lot to soak up in one trip!"}
{"text":"Excellent stuff ...but needs more food trucks!  Good music good weather good crowd.. CLE IS ALL RIGHT WITH ME"}
{"text":"Always great selection, often dubious value.  

I love the selection that the plenitude of food trucks offers.  However...  Ostensibly, the reason for operating a food truck is to reduce the cost of doing business since you don't have to pay for a building, for wait staff, for utilities, and all the other overhead costs that a traditional restaurant incurs.  You can then pass these savings on to the customer with lower-cost food.  However, the reality is that the food trucks charge MORE than traditional restaurants.  For example, I can get three tacos for $6 or $7 at Chipotle, better yet I can get two tacos around the corner at Pedro's for $3.50, so why would I want to pay $10 for three tacos from a truck?  Are they probably better than my $3.50 tacos?  Sure, but double-the-cost better?  Sadly no, there are not.  I think the food trucks get away with a little overpricing due to the food-truck hype, the novelty, and the fact that mostly all of them seem to have the same relatively inflated prices.  If each food truck was delivering exquisite gourmet delicacies, then the prices would perhaps be perfectly justified but most of them are not.  Most of them are delivering average fare, perfectly acceptable but nothing special or remarkable about it or the ingredient selection.  Given that there are tons of local places nearby serving mostly the same food for less, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to pay more for the same thing from a food truck.  The novelty of the event has somewhat of a redeeming value.  It certainly serves as an interesting thing to do for lunch to break up the daily M-F routine.  Will I go back?  I'm sure I will.  Will I leave, as usual, wondering at how little food I got for my money?  I'm sure of that, too."}
{"text":"You know how sometimes the week seems so long that by Tuesday you're already begging for Friday? Walnut Wednesdays is a welcomed break in the middle of the week to get outside in the sunshine (it's Cleveland so sometimes in the rain). Either way it's worth it to pack an umbrella every week just in case. 

I've had the chicken flatbread and tator tots from Nosh Box and also tacos from Barrio (put the sauce on the side if you haven't had it yet. They have little cups for it and it's spicy!) Both lunches cost about $10 and fill me up for the rest of the day. The music has been hit or miss but either way it's a great energy and a really cool group of people celebrating small businesses and enjoying downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Lot of food trucks with lot of options. I am from Texas visiting Cleveland. Hence, I did not prefer to go with the Mexican food but the options looked good from what I can see on the trucks and in the hands of the customers. 

After a brief confused moment regarding what to pick, I went with the orange truck which is advertising gastro food with Italian flavor. I made the right choice. I go the chicken Philly which is basically Italian bread 9 inch with Italian flavored chicken, banana peppers and some red pepper aioli. Whooooowww.. It was terrific. Simple yet great flavor. IT was filling too. I should have ordered another one for to go. Too bad, I am staying here only for a week and probably will not get chance to  try others."}
{"text":"My favorite place to lunch on Wednesdays in the summer in Cleveland. Where else can you have tacos and cupcakes in the same meal?"}
{"text":"This is a great Cleveland experience and shouldn't be missed!  So many food trucks offering everything you can think of from BBQ to sushi to cupcakes.  The location is perfect with lots of cute benches and tables, green areas, and great people watching.  I will definitely be coming back here before the end of summer!"}
{"text":"Love the selection. Today was the start of the 2014 season and I believe it will be grand. The number of people coming to the area was inspirational. 

Our office already has our calendar set every week."}
{"text":"I live in the building right by Perk Park, so Walnut Wednesdays are a weekly thing for me. 

It's dangerous! The food truck selection is overwhelming, because there are so many I want to try. Many people who work downtown take their lunch breaks on Wednesdays down in Perk Park. There are lines always, but what do you expect? The food at every single one of these trucks is worth the wait in line, trust me. 

In my many Walnut Wednesday adventures, I find myself ordering the most from Fired Up Taco Truck for buffalo chicken tacos and Touch Supper Club for kimchi smothered fries. 

There's always live music. Heinens Grocery usually has a booth set up giving away free totes and such. It's a blast to hit up, at least once, or twice, or you could be like me, and hit Walnut Wednesdays up every week."}
{"text":"Definitely a nice lunch spot!! Lots to choose from. We've had lunch here a few times. I like that there's a lot of different choices, from pizza, burgers, tots, to custard, ooh and donuts. There's usually always live music and lots of benches with shade."}
{"text":"I love food trucks - 19 of them to be exact!  Last week, there were 19 food trucks at Walnut Wednesday and 17 the week before.  I love the variety here.  I don't love the prices, but it is a only a weekly outing, so I can justify it that way. I just pack my lunch the rest of the week.  I haven't had a bad lunch yet.  I am so happy to be working downtown again, especially for Walnut Wednesday.

Good stuff!  See you there!"}
{"text":"Walnut Wednesday's  are such a great downtown feature! In the summer months I love walking over and grabbing lunch from one of the MANY food trucks and vendors and then sitting in the sun eating lunch. Parking is difficult so it's more designed for downtown workers but I've also grabbed a bite with my family."}
