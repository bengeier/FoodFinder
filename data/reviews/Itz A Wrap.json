{"text":"Their \"Vegan Delight\" wrap has Havarti cheese in it? You suck Itz A Wrap. Will not return. Ever. And apparently they've had the sign up since at least last year?  I'd give it no stars, but it's not an option."}
{"text":"One of my favourite lunch spots.    Very reminiscent of \"The Sandwich Box\" if you've ever been there.    The Sandwiches are great with quality ingredients.  The Salads are also very tasty with more topping choices than is typical of a lunch place.  The staff are all really friendly.  And if you're a soccer fan, there always seems to be soccer on the television.  The only thing i could knock this place for is the poor layout.  There is a major bottleneck around the cash register, and if you're in the restaurant when it gets really busy it can be a bit crowded."}
{"text":"Most lunches you get in Liberty Village is average $8. This place is a couple dollars more, but theres more food and filling. I just dont like the salad it comes with."}
{"text":"Amazing food but the lady at checkout ruins it all, she has no customer service skills. Let her go!"}
{"text":"this is a popular spot only cuz there is not much options at liberty village.  sandwiches are filling and comes with a bit of greens with some sort of balsamic sauce that is not the best sauce for this bitter salad to have.  i have tried customizing and their daily specials and both were bland and lacked flavour. I stopped going there since the sandwiches were not the best and not the freshest especially the chicken, which tasted pretty old sometimes.  Pricey for the quality you receive. Place is crowded during rush hour between 12- 1 pm as everyone is trying to get their lunch."}
{"text":"Itz A Wrap is in my regular lunch rotation and it's a pretty great spot for special paninis (paniniz?) and salads (itz a salad). The bread comes from Ace Balery, which makes a big different to the quality of your sandwich. Sandwich ingredients and toppings are better quality than you'd find just anywhere, with homemade spreads and dressings, roasted red pepper, eggplant, a variety of good cheeses, grilled chicken and other meats. I always build my own sandwiches instead of choosing from the menu options and love the curry apple mayo.   Sandwiches come with a small side salad. It's expensive and they can be sting-y on toppings. But it's a family owned joint and they make a decent panini, so give it a try."}
{"text":"Itz A Wrap is one of my weekly lunch staples -- I usually go for the southwest wrap, the jerk chicken, or a variation of those two. The salads, chili, and burritos are also quite good. It's a great choice for quick takeout, and the staff are super-friendly."}
{"text":"They gave me the wrong order with big chunky peppers in it (I don't eat peppers) that was about 50% of the volume in the wrap.  The \"jerk chicken\" was overseasoned with cumin and tasted...well...funny.  I threw it out...practically inedible."}
{"text":"I use to go there a lot for lunch as a recently realized that they are really pricey. For two wrap I basically spend about 17 dollars. I love their Tuna sandwich and my partner likes the Philly cheese stake and I really like the salad that come with it - just wish there was more of it.   Ok so what I really don't like is how LONG it takes, yes they are pretty popular in the neighbourhood, and yes the people their seem to be working at full speed, but for some reason every time I go during lunch I spend 20-25 min waiting and the place isn't exactly set up to be \"waiting\" friendly.   So don't go during peak hours if your in a rush because you will most likely end up being late."}
{"text":"Probably won't eat here again. They make a really good wrap just very pricey seeing that its not that big,  and the salad that comes with the wrap was disgusting."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food tasted decent.  It's hard to get too excited about a wrap - that's like getting excited about a sandwich - but I got the philly cheese steak wrap and it did taste good.  However, it was a tiny lunch that left me hungry afterwards.  The wrap comes with a little salad which is basically bitter tasting greens with some oil on them - one bite of that was enough for me.  The wrap itself was very small and not filling.  The cost for that tiny unfulfilling lunch?  Over $8.  They also charge $1each if you want an extra vegetable on your wrap.  If they lowered their prices by about 75% and offered a decent side choice or bigger wrap, I'd be back, but as it is, I doubt I will ever return."}
{"text":"Great service and even better food. Is my go to for quick, cheap and delicious wraps. Also healthy salad options. Is definitely an asset to have so close in Liberty Village."}
