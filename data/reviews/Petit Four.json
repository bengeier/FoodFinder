{"text":"Wow, I'm disappointed at this place. For the price I was paying I was expecting a high quality sandwich. I paid $12 + tax for the Chicken Club Sandwich and Grilled Vegetable salad. What I got was a tiny sandwich haphazardly thrown together, the filling basically not even in the sandwich itself. It tasted no better than a Tim Hortons sandwich. Bread had a weird processed consistency. The Grilled Vegetable salad was nice, but I wouldn't come back here for sandwiches ever.    Also, would it not hurt for your employees to smile. The girl who took my order basically barked what's your name at me before I could even ask her a question about the menu."}
{"text":"While I would love to say that everything about Petit Four is great, I've had a couple of poor breakfast takeout experiences recently.  Their pricing on the breakfast board does not reflect what they serve - for instance, the muffins in the display case are not the same as the \"4 am muffins\" on the board and so are a different price.   The quality of the muffins has also gone downhill in the last couple of months.  They are too sweet, dry, and too greasy compared to what used to be perfect.  With respect to lunch takeout, I find the prices pretty high but portion sizes are large.  The tiny desserts are awesome!"}
{"text":"Lunch with the ladies today, we came for the mushroom soup!!!    Line was small today, never too long a wait and always a friendly 'enjoy your lunch' when you get your food.  Seriously, the mushroom soup is amazing here! It's not a heavy cream soup and has just the right amount of salt.   The Mexican salad - watery lettuce with not enough dressing. I was looking at the salmon/ quinoa salad but changed last minute, bad idea apparently.  I somehow resisted dessert :/"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are fantastic! Their home made focaccia makes their sandwiches far superior to any other downtown takeout places. Plus you can buy it on its own to take home.   The West Side Stack is my go to breakfast sandwich. Bacon, avocado, tomato, lettuce and mayo on sea salt focaccia - you just can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"This is a regular weekday go-to for me. The one hander soups are vegan and delicious (especially the lentil curry one and the mushroom one). Service is relatively fast if you are in a hurry. The made to order salads are better than the ready-made."}
{"text":"Living right next door to the sit-down restaurant Four, Petit Four is a takeout stand carrying the low-calorie meal ideals of its literal big sister.  It's a bit pricey, but their serving sizes are actually reasonable.  Small salads are actually quite large, sandwiches are about 5\" long, and one-hander soups are served in paper coffee cups.    I can't say I honestly enjoy salad, but The Path often leads me here for the Mexican salad on kale when I need a green reprieve from the fried, brown stuff."}
{"text":"Petit Four is a great spot for lunch.  Probably my favourite in the path system.  The soups and salad are fresh.  My favourite is squash soup: a real winner. And in some ways more important for the path citizens, the line tends to move quickly.    If you have a bit more time, and are looking for a slightly more upscale lunch option, you can go right next door to Four.  I highly recommend both."}
{"text":"I like to go here at least once per week. They have a special daily sandwich menu. Tuesday is the chicken meatball sandwich. I love this sandwich, fresh bread, chicken meatballs, mozzarella, and fresh spices. Thursday is the Turkey club, also very good. Made with real Turkey, not the processed stuff. You can add a soup or salad to the sandwich. They have about 6 soups and most are very good. My fav. is the potato and Leek soup. They also have lot's of mini desserts (same desserts served in the larger Four location).  Line ups can get long but they move quickly. Staff is friendly and helpful. If you go late in the day, the sandwiches are pre-made and not as good as main lunch hours where everything is made fresh."}
{"text":"Petit Four is one of my go to places since it is right in the underground of my building. But, I've had some so-so experiences which are causing me to think twice about visiting again. Today I ordered the Tuesday special - chicken meatballs on a bun with provolone and basil.  4 meatballs, barely any sauce a tiny piece of cheese and one measly basil leaf.  REALLY? The flavour of the meatballs is nice but they are a bit dry without any sauce.  I was looking forward to this sandwich but it was totally disappointing...  I have had this happen to me before at PF so now I'm inclined to write a below then great food review."}
{"text":"Love the dessert shots! Lots of choices and good for parties!~"}
{"text":"I picked up some dessert from here today. Their mini-desserts are perfect for when you want something small and sweet. They're delicious without the sinful feeling afterwards. I'm not sure of the name of my dessert, but it was cake, crushed blackberries and a mousse that came together really well. It hits the spot. Added bonus: You could probably clean out the containers and use them to hold various trinkets.  It's also a great lunch spot. I love their sandwiches. It's also the only lunch place that gives an even distribution of dressing to salad; most places don't put enough or put too much."}
{"text":"3 pm Dessert run. During the 9-to-5 crawl. Did it Financial District style.  Bumbleberry Cheesecake($2.00) Double Chocolate Cream($2.00) Pecan Banana Crunch($2.00)  Petit shots.  Miniscule spoons. Every shot had textural toppings. Every shot had two flavour layers.  Pass the Petit Danone off to your coworker instead."}
{"text":"REVIEW FOR CATERING  We use Petit Four to cater a monthly event at my work, which can have anywhere from 20 to 70 guests. They are always pleasant, on time, fully prepared, and best of all are very accomodating to requests and customizations. I think they keep a record of our orders on file, so ordering from them again and again is effortless and an absolute pleasure!   Their catering is EXCELLENT value. Petit Four provides convenient and attractive Lunch Boxes that include a small portion of a sandwhich + a soup or salad + petit dessert-- lots of food and fresh, gourmet ingredients, sure to impress at your next event. All this for the same price that you would pay for a platter of basic deli sanwhiches from Druxy's. Seriously!  In the LUNCH BOX:  SANDWHICHES: All served on focaccia with ingredients like garlic aioli, brie, red onion, salmon salad or roast beef that's tender and pink in the middle.   PETIT SOUP: Perfectly seasoned, delicious, and so thick you won't believe that they're vegan. The Butternut Squash, Mushroom and Curried Lentil are regular winners, and they always have a feature soup to change it up.   PETIT SALADS: Hearty and varied. The asian tofu and medditerannean pasta salads are total gut busters.   PETIT DESSERT: So not the processed mousse I've come to expect from catering... all their desserts are rich, creamy and delicious!  In an effort to change things up I looked into other caterers in the financial district but found none that come close to this level of quality and value--so, we just keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I went to Petit Four for lunch after learning that they bake all their own bread in-house (i LOVE fresh bread!) and hoping that they are low calorie like their restaurant Four.   First thing I noticed was the service is extremely efficient. As soon as I finished paying, my sandwich and soup was already ready for pick up, which comes very convienently packaged in a box with a handle. Their soup is called \"hold a soup\", and i found it kind of weird that my butternut squash soup was so runny, but it made sense when I realized it was meant to be drunk.   I got the turkey sandwich on bacon foccacia bread, which was delicious! It was a bit weird at first to have the bacon on top of the bread, but bacon is always tasty so i went with it and enjoyed it a lot.  For $9 you can get a small sandwich and soup, which was plenty to satisfy me at lunch. At first it seems steep, but when you compare it to other places like soup nutsy, sandwich box, etc - the prices are inline. For another $2 you can get one of their cute shot glass desserts. I've sampled a few at the restaurant Four and I think they are a great idea! Small and intense, they give you the taste of something sweet without the guilty feeling of over-indulging on dessert at lunch time.   Overall, a solid lunch spot where they have the service down pat."}
{"text":"Petit four is the little take out stand for Four. They have sandwiches and salads. The salads are pretty good and a large is pretty filling. The wait for the food after you ordered is fairly quick, but the wait in line can be sometimes slow because ppl are chatting and slow to order."}
{"text":"Petit Four is an excellent bakery with an inviting assortment of sandwiches, salads, soups and baked goods, and a great option for breakfast and lunch in this section of Commerce Court.  I come to Petit Four not to get their hot sandwiches (check their calendar for which ones are available each day of the week), made-to-order salads or combo meals.  My singular interest is in their lentil curry soup.  One of several 'one hander' soups--they also carry tomato fennel, butternut squash, wild mushroom and coconut corn--the lentil soup is by far the best item on the menu.  It's served in a disposable coffee cup.  You can drink from it straight, but watch out for the temperature--it is piping hot.  The soup has a pur√©e-like consistency and is one of the tastiest lentil soups you will ever have.  I am drawn to Petit Four as my default lunch option lately, after they reopened several weeks ago.  Sure I like all their food, but it's all about the lentil curry soup."}
{"text":"These guys make a great roast beef sandwich. As you can see from the picture I uploaded, its a good sized portion and is stacked with toppings. The bread was fresh and delicious and everything worked together nicely, nothing overpowered, especially the horseradish. The soup also hit the spot. It wasn't anything mind blowing, just a good hearty bowl to round out a good lunch.  The line here at lunch can be quite long but it does move well, especially better than Fast Fresh Foods across the hall."}
{"text":"I was hoping that I am going to FOUR.. but since I am either on a diet? or on a budget?  Walking through the FOUR admiring the atmosphere and those nice white table cloths and settings... I ended up at Petite Four at Commerce Court's food court!  Desserts! Mini desserts in perfect portion and the great price of $2 each!   Can I just order everything? I really cannot decide!!  Bumbleberry Cheesecake/Banana Pecan Pudding/Double Chocolate Cream were all deliciously good!! Smooth and Creamy not overbearing sweet but enough to make me feels like I am in dessert heaven.  Me want more!! I for sure will drop by to get more when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"I came for lunch and was pleased to see that there was a minimal wait, even in the ever-busy Commerce Court. I was hungry, so I went for a large California Turkey sandwich which came with a substantial mixed greens side salad (includes balsamic vinaigrette).  The sandwich, made with bacon focaccia with avocado spread (basically guacamole), roasted turkey, and and tangy chipotle mayo was very filling and delicious. The side salad was good, but the provided balsamic vinaigrette was uninspiring and wasn't enough to cover all the salad (I would recommend that you ask for more if you take-out)."}
