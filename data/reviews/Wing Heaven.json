{"text":"It doesn't get any better than Wing Heaven on Durango! I was planning my son's wedding and after one conversation with the owner I was confident I was making the right choice. He went above and beyond to create the perfect menu and personally took control to ensure our every need was fulfilled. And don't get me started on how amazing the wings and catfish were!!! The Garlic Parmesan is definitely my favorite! Whether it's a Superbowl Party, Bachelor Party, or Wedding Tony and his Team are my first choice. Already going back for the New Year's Eve Party! Now that's how you earn a loyal client for life!"}
{"text":"If you want great wings, this is the place to go. I went for the classic hot but they had a huge variety of sauces to choose from. Had the fries and fried pickles. They were good as well. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Today I met 2 awesome guys I am assuming Tony and Les I am going to say that they are the owners can't wait till the new menu rolls out and that you find a spot over on my side of town in the Henderson area food was great as I expected thanks for the great service and food hopefully we can get back on that side of town keep it going guys 
Thanks again"}
{"text":"I don't know what that was I ate but that surely wasn't catfish nuggets. Maybe it's the batter or maybe it was the oil. Whatever the case.....it definitely didn't taste like fried catfish. Fries were cold and stale. I only have it two stars because they were showing the Giants football game. I'll have to make it at home next time."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Ran in right before closing and not a detail was missed. Great shrimp and wings. Will definitely try the fish next time!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars because, being here on vacation for 2 months and craving wings especially that it's only 5min away is great. Been to wings heaven 3x already, my first experience was great wings tasted great a bit salty but not overwhelming.  2nd time I ordered the same thing Hot/lemon pepper and hot wasn't hot and lemon pepper ehh wasn't there! 3rd time I ordered it again and mannnnnn, they were salty! I tried drenching it in ranch but that didn't help. So I called the next day talked to the Manager/owner Tony Miller and he was great! Very helpful and he cooked a batch without the flavor for me to try then seasoned it and asked me if it needed more. He gave me my full order of 50 wings on the house. I recommend this place but make sure to let them know to be lite on the seasoning!"}
{"text":"Now that's what I call good food. When it's so good you fall asleep.  I don't know what you put in it. But every time it puts me in a hypnotic state.  I'm out for the count. Well seasoned to perfection. Only experience a few sweet potatoes were still hard. But overall excellent. Greens, Mac and cheese mmmm. and the banana pudding wow it was awesome.  I give everything 5 plus."}
{"text":"First thing I noticed was the amazing smell when I opened the door. Second, the very welcoming staff. Very kind people. Tony and I chatted while my food was cooking. I ordered wings, catfish nuggets, fries, and fried okra. Third thing I noticed was how amazing the food was! Everything was cooked fresh when I ordered and tasted divine. If you want good food in Vegas stay away from The Strip and all the fancy places and go to Wing Heaven instead."}
{"text":"Best takeout experience ever! Incredibly helpful ordering and when picking up. The manager les and Preston were genuinely kind. Made my day. It's really nice when you feel so well taken care of. 
Also, the wings were absolutely fantastic! 
Will certainly order again, thanks so much!"}
{"text":"I just moved to this side of town with my boyfriend, starving on a Friday night wanting something fast but yet satisfying. Getting tired of our regular pizza night, we decided to go to Wing Heaven... Fit perfectly with him wanting fish and me wanting wings. 
We walk in and it wasn't busy, wait time 20 minuets. We decided to go look at the exotic creatures next door. We come back and they are very nice and friendly. Boyfriend got the cod &butterfly shrimp, me boneless hot. As we're waiting for them to finish their last minuet details, me and the cook get into a conversation about m&m soul food and he offered me to try his banana pudding... OH my GOSH. Best ever!!! The wings were perfect, right amount of sauce, and spice. I will definitely go back and order the banana pudding also something other than wings, and I will come back and write a review again.  

Yours truly,
- satisfied customer!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The wings are always fried to perfection and I'm never left disappointed. They offer a variety of fish options too. I can't wait to come back and try their fries catfish filets."}
{"text":"Best chicken wings I've ever had!  The experience was great too.  We were greeted with a smile and were asked if it was our first time there.  The owner, cant remember his name, told us not to order anything until we tried the chicken wings.  He cooked two chicken wings and let us make the decision if we wanted to eat there or not.  Of course they were amazing, and we did.  Try this place out, you wont be dissapointed!!"}
{"text":"Food is flavored and cooked to perfection. Great soul food! I work at the convenience store almost right next door to Wing Heaven and go there for lunch, when I have money lol. The service is outstanding and the prices are great. They have given me small samples of they flavors they have to offer, because I am now a regular. They really do know what they are doing and I will always recommend them. Don't change a thing guys! You are awesome!"}
{"text":"Excellent food with great customer service!!! Fast service clean restaurant the wings are the boss...."}
{"text":"The food smelled and looked amazing. The staff was super friendly and helpful. Can't wait to check out the food when I get home!"}
{"text":"Found this place through a recommendation on GrubHub and I have to say they are the BEST WINGS I have had in a long time!!  We always get the medium and then change up the second flavor - so far the honey BBQ and the bourbon have been our faves. Affordable prices with great sides (the mushrooms are AMAZING) and they have great deals for football season! Love this place! So glad we found it."}
{"text":"Thought this place had the best food until 3/17 2017 ordered an order of wings  while I thought I would be enjoying low an behold a roach  never again will I eat here"}
{"text":"I've found my new favorite wing place! I eat wings A LOT and usually order from wingstop and if I'm desperate, BWW.  I learned that this place gets their wings FRESH daily, from a supplier 50 miles away from Vegas - Which is a big deal to me, considering these other wing places often times have their wings sitting in heat lamps (with the exception of Wingstop). 

The wings are crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, HUGE (way bigger than both Wingstop and BWW) and the customer service was phenomenal. I tried the Garlic Parmesean and the Mango Habernero, both were great! 

I don't quite understand these other reviews that are reviewing 1-2 stars. The wings are amazing! Oh and their open at 8am on Sundays...so I will definitely be ordering for football Sundays."}
{"text":"This place is amazing great service and super good food the wings are amazing the fish is amazing you have to try it"}
{"text":"VERY DISAPPOINTING WITH YOUR PLACE VERY everything I ordered you are out of Whiting fish okra gizzards MY ORDER OF RED SNAPPER WAS OVER COOK  like rubber the six dollars I could went and bought a whole bag of drumettes I SPENT $17,00 ONE BURN ER PICS RED SNAPPER/6 DRUMMERS never again so mad the first time I had to go back and correct myself"}
{"text":"just went there today in search for some wings, and I'm glad I did because they were so good! Great service and the foo was amazing! It tasted better than WingStop honestly! The best part was they even had koolaid!"}
{"text":"Looking for great Wings, Fresh Fish and everything else look no further. Did I mention amazing customer service. Manager named Les goes out of his way every single time to make your visit pleasant. The food is always on point and quality. Don't get discouraged if your order takes long to complete, perfection takes a minute :)"}
{"text":"Fish was not seasoned and was overcooked. Fries were bland.  I've eaten here several times and the quality of the food is never consistent. Money wasted..."}
{"text":"This place was the best I have ever had!!! Better then wing stop and on top of that I got tons of food for the price I paid!!! This is for sure my wing spot!!! 
Catfish was perfect!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here, tried for first time and got food poisoning. This dump should be shut down. Disgusting place. Was throwing up all night due to them."}
{"text":"The food is okay. Visiting for business and I wanted tome chicken; however, I found the meal I got here to be soggy and underwhelming. It was not wing heaven."}
{"text":"We started going here weekly on Wednesday because they have the .50 wings, however 2 of the 3 times we have ordered the person has been extremely rude and short to us. First he told me that you can only order in groups of 5. I wanted 7 of each, but whatever not a big deal. The problem was really his tone and his obvious frustration with me for not knowing the rules. The next time I called a lady answered and she informed me that there was no such rule and that I could order as much as I would like. Last night my husband calls in with a mixed order of boneless and bone in. When he gives the bone in order he tries to then switch to the boneless order once he has lited all of the bone in wings he wants and the same guy as before tells him that he can only order 4 sauces at a time..  we ordered 6 the first time and 5 the second. This guy just makes shit up as he goes and is rude and condescending in the process. When my husband picked up the order the guy did apologize. My husband got the impression that he may have been the owner or manager. We've decided not to go back as I have never had a problem placing phone orders for wings at other places. They actually seem to appreciate my business instead of being annoyed with it."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't been in here earlier! the food is awesome and so is the staff!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant...and I only eat at one other restaurant. Food is hot and tastes like beef, chicken & pork respectively, not like mystery meat or beef, chicken or pork flavored meat. There is a scrambled egg in the fried rice. It was just all around great."}
{"text":"First time and it will be my last. We ordered the fried fish cod, calamari, and okra. We picked up our order and when we came home my grandmothers calamari ended up being onion rings and I paid for calamari not onion rings. I called them and they told me to bring everything back. They took the onion rings out and gave me the fried calamari but the cod and okra, instead of frying them they just told me \"ok bye\" so now I am eating cold cod and soggy okra. Not to mention they have no spices on the okra. This store is not worth the time or price."}
{"text":"Went in today to get my gizzard craving satisfied !!! This is the best place to get some gizzards, wings,catfish!! I had a perfect lunch!!!! Toney & his staff are the best!! I don't understand these other bad reviews of customer service. I encourage everyone to try something new there every time !!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I'm always looking to support a small business but I will not be returning to Wing Heaven. The young lady at the counter seemed annoyed that we weren't familiar with the menu items as we began asking questions. We ordered the wing combo and we're sent away with wings that had a burnt favor to them and a very small serving of frozen crinkle fries. I was hoping for so much more..."}
{"text":"This is what simple chinese food is suppose to be! Great fried rice! Many places in Charlotte have switched to white rice or plain fried rice with their combos :-( (sad I know) Wing Heaven is doing it right!"}
{"text":"I have gone to this restaurant around three times and each time I have enjoyed the food.  The food is  flavored well and the price is worth what you get.  They have even offered to give taste test, who does that nowadays.

Try it, they will have something that you like on the menu."}
{"text":"as I sit here awaing my usual 2 pds of catfish , the ordering process would be better if the 2 employees working at this time weren't yelling and joking around with each other as well as having the music so loud . had to repeat my order 3 times for them to finally get it . if I wanted to go to a rav then I'd go to a club . might have to be my last time coming here . irritating  !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"A must.. some of the best wings in town. My whole family enjoys eating here and the customer service is just as good!!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try something new and we usually get a sampling before we form an opinion and this was no exception. The staff was nice enough, the boneless wings were fully cooked and very crispy. The garlic parmesan was tasty, but thats about it. The dry seasonings were good but not a fan of the sauces. They didn't mark which wings were which on the containers so we spent 10 minutes trying to figure everything out.

The honey heaven sauce was weirdly overwhelmed with pepper, the teriyaki sauce tasted more light straight soy sauce, the bourbon sauce was way too sweet, and the fried mushrooms had zero flavor.

I'd go back with someone who was wanting to go but wouldn't go out of my way to go back on my own."}
{"text":"The food was great for a fish and wing place. I had the catfish and it was tender on the inside, crispy on the out side. I would order $10-$14 worth of fish or wings. All the people that complain must be from California and are used to people blowing smoke up their A$$ with fake smiles.  I'll I see is a hard working man that makes amazing food. Notice this place either gets 5 stars or 1 star.  1 Star people probably should NOT be eating here. The price range clearly says $11-$30.  The menu is on yelp, when u go into a shop to order, know what u want, order it and get the heck out. I travel allot for work and West coaster are way too sensitive.  don't believe me, try acting like this when you order a SUB in New York. U have exactly 3 seconds to order and you eat the way the cook makes it.  And some of you that got out a weight scale... WOW...  He's giving you a bunch of free food.  Get a life. BTW, why would u ever order fish or wings over the phone? When it gets prepared it needs to be served hot."}
{"text":"Worst wings I ever had in my life. Dry as hell , no flavor , asked for all flat pieces , got that wrong. I can do all day about how bad they were ...but yeah don't do it."}
{"text":"South blvd is pretty much hell on earth but this place is a little window into Chinese food heaven (not wing heaven by any stretch of the imagination. Their name is misleading to say the least). I have always wondered what the hell is going on inside this shady building. First thing you'll notice is that it's an old Pizza Hut building and there are bars on the windows customized with random items from their menu written on them.  I couldn't wait to get inside. 

I walk in and see a few people sitting in the dining room seemingly enjoying their meals. That was a promising sight because given the nature of this bizzare looking place, I was mentally prepared to be the only one eating while the owners stare at me. 

The woman at the front counter slides me a menu and waits for me to order. I told her this is my first time here and I'm excited to try the food! She replied with \"ok\" while pointing to the menu. Alright no problem, tough crowd but I'm ok with it. So I look at the menu and see the standard Chinese fare. The place is called wing heaven and according to their window (and menu) they offer said heaven in a five piece option. I have to try them along with something I'm used to getting from Chinese restaurants. So I look up and order 5 hot wings and general Tso chicken off the lunch menu. The lady didn't really understand and she started pointing to the menu again. Now I realize she doesn't know any English outside of the word \"ok\". So I start pointing at the menu to let her know what I want. I'm totally cool with not wanting to learn English because it's actually a difficult and complex language but if you're going to own and operate a restaurant here at least learn enough English to get by.  Minimally learn your menu so you don't have to point at the menu and make noises to communicate like cave people. 

Once I got my order in I went to the dining room to wait. I was pretty happy when I saw the family having lunch in the corner because their little daughter was listening to the Spanish version of the song \"let it go\" on an iPad and I love that song, but recently have been kind of over it so it was refreshing to hear a remix. 

The food came out in about 5 minutes and the gen Tso looked so good. The nice guy that brought out the food said \"here you go, enjoy!\" And I wanted to be like dude you need to work the counter.  I didn't though. 

I get right into it. I opened the box of wings and my fears became reality. It's your basic Chinese food wings. Breaded, overly big and not good looking. This just solidifies the fact that Chinese restaurants don't get it when it comes to wings. I tried one just to make sure, and yea they're horrible. 

The general Tso was unreal. Perfectly fried and extra spicy. The egg roll was on the small side but absolutely delivered on the taste factor. It was a thing of beauty. They even have what looks like a home made hot sauce bottled up on some of the tables. I put a bunch of that on the fried rice and it works. Big time. 

Stay far away from the wings but go hard on the normal stuff. Absolutely try this place."}
{"text":"Went back for my Gizzard and as promised they had them. Their food is so delicious you can't help but come back. The Customer service was excellent Delmonte was awesome and very friendly. Brandon was awesome  and friendly as well; he made sure I got my cheesecake too. Love me some Wing Heaven."}
{"text":"First time stopping into this place. Great customer services!! Owner is so friendly! Chatted with me the whole time while I waited on my food. The wings were so yummy! I will be ordering them way more often! The tilapia was tasty as well, my friend loves it with the old bay spice. Oh and they have Kool-Aid! Had a little sample of it and it was deliciously sweet :)"}
{"text":"First time trying Wing Heaven.  I gotta say, they are pretty good!  I ordered through Yelp and was glad to find that Yelp has teamed up with Grub Hub!  I ordered the medium buffalo boneless wings and my daughter ordered the BBQ boneless wings.  Both were delicious.  I did find that reheating the buffalo wings weren't the greatest, so I wouldn't recommend reheating those.  However, the BBQ wings reheated were pretty good.  I'd definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best wings in town! Took forever but was well worth it. We ordered the Spicy Garlic (not really spicy) & Lemon Pepper (dry). Seasoned to perfection finished off with some ice cold kool aide :-)"}
{"text":"Love this spot food always hot and delicious service is great we order from here every Friday.... They know me by name."}
{"text":"this place was delicious!! Was in the mood for Chinese and was actually on the way to another spot when I saw this one on South blvd. and I am SO glad we did!! got the beef w/mixed veggies, side of lo mien, and egg drop soup, and it came with an egg roll! BF got wings, fried rice, just as yummy. total was only $16 and change. would highly recommend. They were open at 10 on a Thursday, empty in side, but the attendant was SUPER sweet."}
{"text":"Went in tonight for the first time and have to say these are some of the best wings I've had in Vegas! We got a combination of garlic parm, medium buffalo, and honey mustard and none of them disappointed. The staff was also super friendly! Definitely will be back for more!"}
{"text":"So, to add insult to injury & on top of the very worst food I have ever had in my life the manager Tony Miller, chose to send me a message on yelp and tell me that I was \"just upset\" and that's why I left a bad review. This is completely inaccurate. The service was terrible
& the food I received was so dissatisfying
that I threw it in the trash! Wasting 20$ and going to sleep hungry! His message was disrespectful as is his staff and the food they serve. If I could give 0 stars I would. I am appalled that he had the nerve to inbox me with his passive aggressive bullshit!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here tonight. It will be the last time by the time.I got my food home it was dry and just not what I was expecting"}
{"text":"Great wings and people.  I like how they fry the wings extra crispy unlike other places.  Many wing flavors sauces and rubs.  Not very many places offer the different types of shrimp, fish, chicken gizzards, and wings like this place."}
{"text":"The food is good. However, they're slower than molasses and the owner keeps all of the tips. The employees get nothing. That's straight from the owner's mouth. He claims it's to pay for the card machine, which only costs 3% of each transaction or $0.81 on a $27.05 bill (the cost of 30 wings). I can't in good conscience do business with a guy who pockets tip money for no reason."}
{"text":"Hard to go a weekend without their hard fried catfish with Old Bay seasoning! The best in town. Very friendly service and always helpful. Wish there was one on the southeast side of town. Gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"The catfish use to be good i got catfish today and it was not cooked all the way the man at the register didn't know what he was doing,and they r so skimpy on the fries the orka was burned,and disgusting I will not be going back,and I will let other people know not to go"}
{"text":"I'm once again leaving a very satisfied customer. They provide so many flavors but I can't seem to stay away from that garlic parmesan. My tummy thanks you! :)"}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating here since it opened. Every time we go it is fresh and super YUMMY! They marinate the bone-in wings and it makes all the difference. Hands down the best wing place in LV. Plus the kool-aid is the perfect touch :) Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"This is my fourth time at Wing Heaven. This time I only had Koolaid. And, it was sooooo good. Extra cold and sweet! In the past, I've had their wings and catfish. I love the variety of seasonings for wings and fries. The catfish was fried to perfection. In addition to the great food, the staff is always friendly. The owner, Tony, is always on site ready to accommodate his customers. Wing Heaven is an awesome fixture in Centennial Hills and I would recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"The white gulf shrimp is bomb , along with the catfish and fried calamari... And the fried chicken done just how I like. Topped off with A-1 style customer service. I enjoyed my time here and will most definitely be a returning customer."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time last night. We got wings fries jalepeno poppers and the butterflied fried shrimp. Everything was delicious. When I walked in and ordered there was only one guy working and he was super busy but he told me 15-20 minutes and that's just how long it took. He was very polite by the way. We will most definitely be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Visited this establishment today with my son. This was the first time I had visited this placed. We placed an order of 25 wings with the bone- in. We got our order and went home. As I open the container I noticed that the order was for boneless wings and not the bone-in I ordered. I immediately got in the car and drove back to the place. I told the employee that the order was wrong and that I would like an order with bone-in wings. He refused to correct the order or give me my money back, so I left the wrong  order on the counter and left. I still believe in the old saying,\" A Customer is always right.\"  I will never be back to this place ."}
{"text":"Cheap wings, 10 for $10 (something) But even then not worth the price. At all. The texture of the wings was really tough they were hard and sorta burned, the chicken wasnt tender whatsoever. They were tiny and shrunken and hard to crew through cause they were so hard. The flavor, oh boy. SALTY. that's it. No flavor at all but salt. I wanted to try again to give them a fair review but honestly once was enough. First impressions matter. Do not recommend at all."}
{"text":"All the rumors about service here are true: it's the pits. I happened upon this spot while stopping in next door at the Retro Bakery for dessert. Delightful staff, there! 

I love me some fried fish, chicken tenders, basically everything they have to offer here at WH. What I don't love is attitude. Being greeted by an ominous \"you're on camera!\" sign. What a welcome. And waiting. For fast food. While staring at a wall. 

Read the other reviews for the variety of poor customer relations you can expect. Mine included placing my order, being asked what flavor tenders I wanted (which apparently means what sauce), asking what flavors they have, and being wordlessly pointed towards the menu mounted near the ceiling. Could not be bothered to just use words and tell me. 

It took about 15 minutes for my order to come through. Why? Only one person was working there. At 5:30pm. Rush hour. If you're going to be a fast-food place, you need more than one employee working the joint. 

If you're *not* going to be a fast-food joint, and claim your food is fresh, then perhaps your business needs to be about more than pulling stock from the freezer, dropping it in a fryer, and serving it. 
I will say, though, that the fryer is top notch. It's the reason this experience gets two stars and not one. The outside of my tenders and fish nuggets? Perfect crisp, no excessive oil drip, and flavorful. 
The inside? Has that styrofoam taste and texture of twice-frozen Walmart-sale bin fish.

The prices certainly aren't fast-food prices, either. No dollar menu here. In fact, prices are almost comparable to world-renown chef Gordon Ramsey's new fish&chip joint, and that boasts an expensive Strip location, his namesake, multiple employees, and...just guessing...actual fresh ingredients. 

So what gives? I don't think WH knows what it wants to be, and I don't think the people working here really want to own and run a business, judging by the consistency of reviews faulting service and product. I won't be back, and I'm certain they don't care either way."}
{"text":"Always such a great Customer service experience and the food is like none other within miles, for that type of food. Thanks wing heaven."}
{"text":"Great wings, will definitely return and try the other flavors. Thank you Dee for your hospitality."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times and the wait is horrible. The last time I came in I had one person ahead of me and still waited approximately 30-40 minutes for my food. I ordered 1lb of catfish plain because they tend to over season and turns out way too salty, clerk told me it was already pre seasoned but I decided to give it a go. I had the catfish plain or easy on the seasoning before and it turned out perfect but this time it turned out too salty . When I took my first bite the saltiness over powered the fish. I had to scrub the seasoning off. Maybe I'll come in when certain cooks are around so I can get what I actually order. As for I'll different soul food restaurants before I check this place out again."}
{"text":"I had fried gizzards ordered for pickup. When i received them they were small, overcooked and full of grease. I am from the south and i know good gizzards. These looked as if they were the last of the bottom of the bag.  Thumbs down"}
{"text":"I go to this place at least once a week! The catfish and shrimp are always fried to perfection. Don't miss out!!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is wwwoowww. I haven't had good wings like this in a very long time. My husband and I can not stop craving these wings! We live in CA and are seriously considering driving out for some wings and fried pickle spears! Not only is the food good but service was great as well. My husband ordered scorching and hot wings. Sadly they where out of  scorching BUT.. They made a special sauce for him and he LOVED it. I ordered bourbon and honey heaven.   I almost cried when they where gone. We will definitely be going back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Well, Yelpers, the many negative comments regarding the customer service (or lack thereof) are valid and we should have listened to you. Unfortunately, we had to find this out for ourselves. This review is just speaking about the service as we never got to the point of actually eating the food here.

We placed our order over the phone, waited the estimated 20 minutes, and went to pick up our food. After a curt greeting, I said I was picking up an order and this is what followed:
  WH - 'You'll have to wait. Whether you ordered in person or on the phone, it'll be 30 minutes.'
 Me - '30 minutes from when?'
 WH - 'From when you ordered.'
 Me - 'Well, I ordered almost 30 minutes ago, so am I just looking at a few more minutes?'
 WH - 'It'll be 30 minutes.'
 Me - 'So, 30 more minutes from now?'
 WH - 'We're behind so you're just gonna have to wait.'

Aaaaaand, cancel that order."}
{"text":"Pretty solid Chinese place.  Prices are low.  $6.25 for the General Tso's I got.  Honestly I'd rather pay a dollar or two more and get a little more chicken.  Flavor is solid but not the best I've ever found"}
{"text":"Excellent. The wings are cooked perfect every time! The spices and sauces have no flaws. Lemon pepper and honey BBQ are my favorites. You can taste the freshness.  I love that this is a family business, you can taste the love 

I tried many wing places around town. This is by far my new favorite place. So glad I was able to order delivery too."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I enjoy wingstop better, but this place is better than BWW. I did not have any interaction with the staff since I ordered from postmates. I ordered a 5 wing combo, hit, and 5 additional wings, garlic parm. They have crinkly fries. This place would have been 4 stars but the ranch is VERY bland. I'm a ranch snob. When I go to swing places I expect the ranch to have some sort of tang. Nope. Hidden valley had more tang than this stuff. Food was HOT when it arrives at my door. Wings were cooked, maybe a little over, but I enjoyed the flavor. I had hot wings and it had a nice kick but not overly dresses. The garlic parm had real garlic on it, I think it was put on raw so that the garlic had extra spicy kick to it. My taste buds still taste like garlic. A lot of garlic. The dry rub was nice since the wings were nice and crispy. Will reorder from this place but prob won't get the garlic just because I think I'll be tasting garlic for days."}
{"text":"First of all, let me say the customer service was great, that's what pushed it from 3 stars to 4. I felt like me, Wayne and the other guy (whos name I forget but seemed like a boss?) clicked just fine.

The wait was a bit long, maybe 20 minutes, but thats what real fresh food takes. Also, they asked if I like my wings more crisp, and yes I do, so that adds time. 

Had catfish, perfectly cooked, tartar and slaw was good, not outstanding.
Chicken strips were as good as anywhere, easily as good as raising canes or better. Spicy dipping sauce, and what I think was also a spicy ranch? Decent.

And a family order of fries and wings. Fries were nice and plump, very good. They get a bit soggy in the styrofoam so you may want to consider serving them in another way.

The chicken wings, 10 honey BBQ, yum and 20 scorching. I told these guys you can't make it too hot for me, and they apparently took that as a personal challenge, LOL. Them bas**rds were HOT! By the time I ate them all I was scorching. 

Actually it was 19 wings as one of them was a bit off, missing most of it's meet. They graciously noticed this and offered me a free Kool-Aid to make up for it (and to eat the offending wing) The Kool-Aid is sweet and yummy. The wings, even before saucing are well seasoned with a bit of cajun rub.

40 plus dollars before I left, not exactly cheap, but very very yummy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service! This place is awesome in every way! So happy I found it as I drove over 20 miles because of the great referral I got and needed some terrific food :-) I found it here.  All the guys that work there are so amazing and EVERYONE had a great attitude and the customer service, food and fun was just perfect! Big props to Les who works there as he was just an angel. Thanks again guys! We will be back a lot!!"}
{"text":"The quality of food is good... Quantity on the other hand is not there They advertise  1lb-1/2lb of fish or fries etc but either their  weighing it frozen or their  scale is  broken.  Either way Quality is there but not Quantity. Im gonna givem 3stars for now..."}
{"text":"New Guilty Pleasure. 
Go there. Now. 
Not overly fried. Not overly seasoned. Not salty. Just right. I don't even like catfish but I ate theirs. And I enjoyed it. My husband and I shared the lunch specials. $5 wings with fries and mini apple pie and drink. $6 fish with fries pound cake and drink. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Food is pretty darn good; customer service has gotten better; owner seems like a cool guy. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Went to Wing Heaven earlier to get my seafood fix and was simply amazed. Was greeted and acknowledged right away by the friendly staff and proceeded to put my order. There's so many kinds of fried fish and intresting combos like the chicken and waffles down to the fried okra. Of course I've heard like so many on yelp about their wings being excellent, but today I was having the shakes for fish. I ordered a pound of catfish nuggets, fried mushrooms and french fries. Mmmmmm mmmmm!!! All were layered with exceptional flavor that was to die for. Nothing on my order was prepped bland and that's what puts this place over the rest. If you want fried food that's flavored just right and without the heart stopping grease, Wing Heaven does it all! (Side note) met the owner Tony who is a great people person who runs his business efficiently with his hard working staff. Give them a try and they are sure to not disappoint!"}
{"text":"The catfish was amazing!  Fried crispy not greasy.  Add a little hot sauce and I got teenage girls hooked on catfish.
The staff were so nice and over friendly and helpful for us.  What a treat."}
{"text":"I had the catfish & french fries.  The catfish is just average. The fries were exceptionally good with the side of cheese. It's worth going back for in the future.  I had my doubts about the fries but I'm gonna title them the best fries in Vegas. The employees have a attitude problem. They will run good loyal customers away with all they foolishness.  Just uncalled for foolishness & for no good reason. I said I've never been here are your wings good? I was told I don't eat take out. I said ok placed my order & left. Total I give it 3 stars. I will return."}
{"text":"Just ate some of the best wings ever! My husband and I shared 20 piece hot; honey heaven and Bourbon! All flavors were tossed right in front of me and the taste was finger licken! We also tried the mushrooms and cheese bacon wedges! We will be back to try the fried fish tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Great Customer Service, nice vibe & the wait was PROMT. The Grape Kool Aid was tasty and the lemon pepper wings were good."}
{"text":"I love this place! Best wings in town, and awesome staff, very clean, friendly and down to earth environment."}
{"text":"Again, Wing Heaven has delivered, literally, they came through and delivered dinner for my meeting. We are here representing every coast and we all agree, the wings are BOMB. And TONY and ACE are awesome!"}
{"text":"I am a crazy about Chinese food specially when it comes to fried rice and wings!
This place is not that far from my job so I went there for lunch to check them out. My husband told me so many times about this place but for some reason we always ended up going to different places. From outside it does not look that interesting, the decoration inside is very simplistic, but everything was clean and organized. The lady who was serving the food was very friendly. I got the S1, their special of 6 wings and shrimp fried rice, it cost me less than 8$. 
The place was not busy at all, the food came fast and for my surprise was a LOT of fried rice!
The rice was soooo delicious, one of the best that I've ever had. The chicken was well seasoned and crunch as it was supposed to be. 
I have a feeling that I will be coming back here many times from now on."}
{"text":"One of the best tasting chicken wing places, I have had the pleasure of ordering from. Deliciously flavored, I had Lemon Pepper and Garlic Parmesan. Ace the employee was admirably nice and so was his co-worker. I just didn't get her name. I would highly recommend trying"}
{"text":"I wish that I could consistently be able to give this place a good review but once again I'm left with a bad taste in my mouth about this place.  

This was my go to place for fish Friday.  Buy a 1 lb fish combo and get 1/2 lb for free.  

Before I've been left with just a lb and today I didn't even get a full lb of fish.  Just under 12 oz and we paid for a pound. 

Now. I just want what I pay for. The fish is great but when your ordering food and plan on getting a certain amount you should get what you pay for period !"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely disgusting!!!!! Taste like food was in old grease. Boneless chicken wings tasted old. Lemonade coolaid was full of sugar. My sons stomach started hurting really bad.

Never again will I eat this.........
This place holds a major LOOSER or FAIL!

Should be rated 0 stars however made me put at least one star in order to continue...SMH!!!!!"}
{"text":"When we moved to Vegas two years ago, this was the place to come. Great and speedy service but the past two months has been a total mess. It takes forever to get food. You are given a time to pick up food and when you get there the food is not ready. Today we went (45 mins after ordering) and it was chaotic, teens running the restaurant, no orders ready, out of fish, just total disorganization. Needless to say, I will make the longer drive to Wing Stop to get my chicken wing fix."}
{"text":"Paul's YER (Yelp Elite Rating): 3.75 Stars (Rounded UP)

OK, so I was EXCITED to try this Mom and Pop's place soley based on the Yelp Reviews. Like everyone here has stated, it looks SOOOOOOOOO, hummm, \"Iffy\" from the outside? Yup, it sure does. But the INSIDE is CLEAN and inviting. No kidding. It's like something out of I Dream of Jeanie (yeah I'm THAT old to remember that stuff - yikes!), where Jeanie puts a Taj Mahal space inside a garage, etc.....

Now I had NO problem communicating with the lady behind the counter. Thick Chinese accent? Yupper. Did she speak decent English? Yupper again! She was pleasant and friendly, and helped me make a selection since it was my first time here. 

So I read about the \"amazing\" General Tso's chicken, so that was a must. Someone said their Egg Rolls were \"purdy goot\" too, so thankfully they came with my entrees.....of which I got a SECOND one (because Chinese makes GREAT left over lunches!), and that second entree was their Beef Egg Foo Young. So I got an Egg Roll and a SPRING Roll (which was a great idea.....more on that later).

And of course, being half Asian, I always order a rice dish, so I got their House Special Fried Rice. All for moi, one big eater who loves Chinese leftovers!

What stood out? The Beef Egg Foo Young! THAT was DELICIOUS! To me much of it has to do with the brown sauce, and theirs seemed to be Teryiaki based but NOT too sweet, which was good. More like a savory sweet. I'm an Egg Foo Young manwhore so yes, I loved it! But NOT all EFYs are that good! This one was! Just about as good as Dragonfly's for somewhat less $$$. So 5 Stars for this dish.

The Spring Roll was much better than the Egg Roll. Not that the Egg Roll was bad. But the Spring Roll was really crispy and reminded me more of a Thai Roll than a Chinese roll. Nonetheless, it was yummy! 4 Stars on the Spring Roll, 3 Stars for the Egg Roll.

I was slightly disappointed with the General Tso's Chicken. It WAS good. But after reading the reviews I guess I was expecting AMAZING! While good, it was NOT \"amazing\" by any stretch of the imagination. It did have some nice heat which I really liked. But it wasn't as \"crispy\" as I'd like so 2.5 Stars for the GTC.

The House Special Fried Rice was pretty good, with chicken, beef and shrimp. A 3 Star Effort.

Each entree came with white or fried rice and an Egg Roll (like I did, you CAN opt for a Spring Roll which I recommend).

Bottom line: LOTS of good quality food for not a whole lot of money! Definitely a business we should ALL support because this is NOT a chain restaurant. It's a hard working Mom and Pops effort so I recommend them to all my fellow Yelpers! I've passed this place up for as long as I've been here in Charlotte (since Feb 2011) and I judged this book by it's crappy cover. Don't make the same mistake I did. Come check them out then Yelp your review!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service! 

It's not a fancy eatery, but it's a better alternative from your common fast food joints. When I came in all the employees greeted me quickly and made me feel welcome. As I approached the counter an employee impressively showcased the menu, recommended popular favorites, and provided me with samples of their specials of the day. I sampled the chicken wings, shrimp, and calamari, and they were all packed with amazing flavor! 

After ordering, the employee realized he had accidently over charged me. He respectfully apologized, then returned the difference. 

If you're in the mood for great chicken wings and seafood take out, I recommend Wing Heaven. It's a great small business that has impressed me with their service, food, and integrity. 

Give the expensive cooperate cookie cutter restaurants a break, and give this local small business a try! You won't be disappointed!

Honestly,
Shawn G."}
{"text":"I tried this place twice, the first experience was horrible and the second was even worse. I'm sorry but they do not know how to make fried food. They are very expensive, now mind you I don't mind paying money for good quality food; however, wing heaven is no where near good or even okay. Fried fish is suppose to be crunchy and fresh. Fish is not suppose to taste like old oil and it is not suppose to fall apart. Fish is suppose to look crunchy and look gold. They act like they don't use old oil but they do. You can tell and smell the difference between new oil and old oil. I'm sorry but this place needs to go out of business. If not I highly do not recommend this place unless you want a disappointed. 


For the people that rated this place at 4 stars; shame on you guys. Obviously you guys do not know shit about fried fish. Or maybe you guys know the owner so you guys give wing heaven good reviews. 


Oh yeah by the way your wings suck too."}
{"text":"Definitely way better than any of the competitors. Because of how busy it gets, it sometimes can take a little time to get your order. Be patient. The taste is well worth the wait. Also know this place is takeout only. I ordered the Honey Haven sauce. Don't let the name fool you. It isn't a sweet wing sauce. It's the perfect sauce to choose if you are a wing fan. It's a nice blend of sweet and spicy. Highly recommend it. It may seem a little spendy if you don't order the lunch specials, but it's worth the price. I made mine a combo and made the mistake of trying the fries before I got home because \"I wanted to give the fries a fair judgement based on how they taste fresh.\" Yeah. At least half of the fries didn't make it home because they were so damn good. I think I might order again tomorrow so I can try the chipotle BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"This place is located right next to the 7-11 on Farm and Durango!I was pretty skeptical about trying this place out. I'm a huge wing person and didn't want to drive down to Bdubs for some so I tried this place out since it's right behind the house! I got mild and it was really good! It was borderline almost too hot for me but I loved it. Crispy wings too! They don't have that many fryers which is odd for a wing place. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This was a great experience the service was very attentive and got my order right the food was typical fried food but there was a better quality to it it was extremely tasty and the kitchen are was very clean keep it up folks and my wife and I will be back

The only thing missing was a sit down area

In time maybe

In time"}
{"text":"Ordered the lemon pepper, spicy garlic and medium sauces. The lemon pepper dry was good but the medium sauce tasted like fish and the spicy garlic was just taking a bite out of a garlic clove. Very crispy. Also ordered the mac & cheese wedges which had hardly any cheese inside. For $30 worth of food I don't think it was worth the price. Overall I think I'll pass next time."}
{"text":"The food is always good. Ther my favorite Chinese Restaurant in Charlotte. Very reasonable prices as well."}
{"text":"I will give this spot 1 star because I have to put a star here! the food was mediocre I order fish and cheese sticks and didn't check the bag before I left but the guy in there didn't give me any tarter marinara sauce! And I was charger 18 bucks, the service was very bad also I will never try this place again!"}
{"text":"I dig me some killer INFERNO WINGS, they make a great sauce on that one!  Hot is good too!   SCORCHERS are my favorite.   10 minute wait as they making anything fried for your little hearts desire, and to feed the beast inside you.  Enjoy this NW Vegas tradition at this location. Wing Heaven@!   You will feel like you are in heaven after eating them and like you are in hell the next day, as you must go back for more....lol  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place and man, was i disappointed. The cashier seemed list, some young kid. I didn't even bother correcting his error. The owner didn't even greet us, not that he has to but...
There's nowhere to sit so i guess it's an order and go. The food was meh. The wings had way too much garlic, i had to wipe sone off. The catfish was just ok.  I won't be going back. If you want the best catfish, go to Mario's Westside Market on Lake Mead and MLK. I've had catfish all over the south and Mario's is beyond bomb."}
{"text":"Wings are always really good here! Spicy BBQ is so good! Staff is friendly, and and always very helpful."}
{"text":"Don't bother.

$6.49 for 5 wings, and terrible service.

I waited at the register for 10 minutes......and was ignored the entire time.  So I went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Great wings!! Loved the mango habanero traditional wings! Sweet with a little bit of spice, really awesome. Service was really friendly and food came out quick, hot and delicious. Will be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"The portions are huge. The food is typical entry level chinese stuff, maybe a step above. This place is an old pizza hut, so don't expect too much in atmosphere. 

That said, the staff is super friendly, and the prices are really cheap. I don't eat here often, but if you are really hungry and want pretty good food at a great price, stop on in."}
{"text":"Wing Heaven is located on Durango & Farm/El Capitan right next door to Retro Bakery. I've been pretty excited for this place to open...wings AND seafood! My wife doesn't eat seafood so it's perfect for us. They have a few things to choose from. Traditional and boneless wings, chicken strips, gizzards and a few seafood options...catfish, tilapia, cod & butterfly shrimp. Then they have a bunch of side items like fries, wedges, fried pickles and some other goodies. The menu seems pretty basic at first but they let you use the \"seasonings\" on pretty much everything so there's a ton of options. Not to mention quite a few wing sauces.

We went with lemon pepper wings, honey heaven wings, old-bay catfish and some sides...fried pickles and bacon cheddar wedges. The wings were cooked pretty dang close to perfect and had a nice crispy texture on the outside. The honey heaven which came as a suggestion from the owner is killer! It's kinda sweet and tangy but it has a little kick to it. The catfish was also really good, not too heavy on the seasoning and fried a nice golden brown. Sides were awesome. Real bacon on the wedges! Fried pickles with decent batter and not all soggy! And they have Kool-Aid! What's not to love?!

Kinda teetering on 4.5 stars with this place. They are take out only so don't come prepared to sit and eat. Even though we live close, the hot food in a bag made my catfish get a little soggy which in all honesty was the only flaw in the food for me. Everything was tasty, they have excellent customer service, a super friendly staff and the prices are more then reasonable. I dug it! Wing Heaven will be seeing me quite a bit!"}
{"text":"Okay..... I had Wing Heaven tonight for dinner and it was awesome. You might have to wait 10-15 minutes for your food but it is hot and good. To me they have the best Fish Friday deal in town. The staff was getting slammed tonight but they rocked it out!!!! I love going here and spending my money because I know I will get good hot food. Keep up the good and hard work and I will keep spending my money."}
{"text":"Great place for catfish, cod, talapia and wings.  14 different sauces for wings.  Good assortment of sides."}
{"text":"The customer service is the worst.  I have been here twice and both times the same girl had the same terrible attitude and made me feel as if I was putting her out by ordering food.
I called an order in, was given a 25 minute wait, only to arrive and wait another 15, I only ordered five wings mild.  They didn't appear busy, only one other customer was in there."}
{"text":"No restrooms for customers. We had to go across the street to McDonalds. The location is horrible. We went to many of the stores located beside them and they all stated that they did not have public restrooms. The attedant in the 711, stated tgat tgis is a high crime area. However when we asked the attendant at the wing place he stated that they didn't have public restrooms do too it was a lot of high-maintenance to clean up and it could cause their reviews to go down. Prices are not as they say on the website.  

Wings are good. I give it an 8 out of 10... but service was a 2 

Maybe management will change the image and customer service... then the place will be a hit... 

Coaching the employees on how to interact with customers is key!"}
{"text":"Try the wings and the fish! The name says it all...they were both great! We just moved from Cleveland and was in the mood for a good fish dinner. The catfish and the tilapia was tasty. Lester was very nice, courteous and displayed exceptional customer service."}
{"text":"Always a great encounter with this restaurant!!
Food is great and prices are reasonable! Don't forget to get the kool aid!!!!"}
{"text":"I went in tonight for some fast dinner. Big mistake! First off, the place is very dirty and smells as though they haven't changed the grease in a long time, judging by the teenagers behind the counter, my guess is that it is lack of knowledge. Second, they were very rude and unprofessional. But I was hungry so I soldiered on. Then I got home only to open up what I thought was a joke! It wasn't.. The boneless wings are actually nuggets, and at 1.00 a piece, I felt very short changed. Then the over whelming smell of fish( in my wings box) hit my nose. I couldn't even bring myself to try them. This place should and probably will be closed very shortly. What a horrible experience and waste of $10.00. I highly recommend you drive the extra 2 miles south to Buffalo Wild Wings and get what you pay for at least. As a hard working mother of 4, I would highly recommend spending your money somewhere else. Very disappointed.. And hungry."}
{"text":"So glad I found this place. Noticed it on a random food run. Really glad me and the girlfriend wanted to change it up. First time we came and order wings with jerk sauce... yum yum. Also had the bacon cheddar wedges, which I love. Biggest thing I liked was the friendly staff. They were very busy the day we found them, but the staff was helpful. Will go back."}
{"text":"well i just called to place a to-go order and was turned away because they stop taking orders at 8:30, even though i called right on the dot.... they dont close for another half hour... THAT already put a bad taste in my mouth.. so much for a new place in the area...THANKS BUT NO THANK!"}
{"text":"Wings ok.  Service is horrible.  Takes forever people not that friendly. If you feel like standing around for 45 min to an hour. (Since there is really no where to sit) then you may like it. I ordered the chicken and waffles and lemon pepper wings. The waffle was good but the wings were very small and a little too salty for my taste.if they focused on their customer service this place would actually be OK."}
{"text":"I order some wings from Wing heaven just a About an hour ago! I got a call from the wing shop saying they are running behide but I talked to Damonta he was great! He made sure my food was being taken care of and it was on the way too me! Damonta was great and I will go back just because Damonta  is amazing"}
{"text":"Well I always believe in second chances , so I did not write my review until trying this place twice. First of all, the wings are just OK. Nothing special and I would not go out of my way to eat here.

The menu is Impressive and it's a very clean place. 

However, on my first visit, the owner/manager was very cold and seemed to care less about my business. 

The second time, I decided to call in my order. The same owner/manager answered the phone with a tone as if I was annoying them by calling. When I told him I wanted to place an order he said HOLD ON!

Well, I didn't hold on and I did not give them my money a second time. 

There is a lot of competition in this city, and you have to treat your customers well and appreciate their business."}
{"text":"We love this place. The food is so delicious. The managers always make sure their customers leave happy and pleased with the service. The family deals offered on Sunday's are a great deal. I would definitely recommend wing heaven"}
{"text":"I agree with Carlton this place is disgusting. 

The prices are high, the food is bad. The wings are terrible when compared to Wingstop, in price and quality."}
{"text":"I was a little iffy about this place because I am a type of person that if I like a place I will keep going there and rarely try anything new. But I am HAPPY! I did!!  I love crab and they have it! Tony really cares about customers! We got a lot of crab legs!! So delicious!!!! The crab is sweet but the outside has a spice seasoning that made it more tasty.  He also let us sample calamari which was good too! I am definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! My new wing place. The customer service is amazing and the food is well, heavenly. Do yourself a favor. Try the honey heaven sauce. Trust me. 

Thanks Wing Heaven for delicious food and great service."}
{"text":"Ordered to go. They forgot to put it in the dipping sauce as I have requested. The wings were okay. Not as good as I was hoping for. The fries were soggy. T I've had better food and service. Not coming back."}
{"text":"$0.50 just to use a debit card?! Ok what ever I can live past that but having me wait 40min for the catfish and wing basket and then on top of it forgetting to give me half of my catfish??? Come on! I really wanted this place to be good but the pics are better than the food unfortunately. I'm not sure where the manager hired the people behind the counter but it was like watching a 5 year old try and drive a car! They didn't know how to ring stuff up, they didn't have a lot of things on the menu, they didn't know what they were cooking for who and what timers were for what. I'm pretty sure if a health inspector came out to this place it would get shut down for health violations. The ONLY thing that is well done is the sign for the store but it's deceiving. It lures people in to think that this might be a good place to eat and then BAM! Your hit with horrible service and below average food. Don't waist your time with this place."}
{"text":"This review is for the catfish only. 

I'll be short & to the point - the best fried catfish I have ever had!! Lightly fried, seasoned perfectly. So good I just got 3 lbs take-out to take back with me to LA tomorrow."}
{"text":"Ok, first off I love small businesses so when the place that closed here (seafood station was great)  was replaced with another mom and pop type spot I was excited. Sadly, that was short lived. 

I have been here a couple of times, not impressed either of those times.

My first time the person on the phone seemed totally annoyed by my presence, so much so I almost left until another customer came in so I stepped up.  First time I went in I tried the catfish nuggets and boneless wings. The catfish was ok, but I was not impressed. The boneless wings (spicy garlic) had absolutely no flavor, I was totally disappointed.  

The second time the customer service was much better, although the guy ringing me up waved me in close and offered \"good deals for cash\" I feel bad for the owner, he/she is probably being robbed blind. I bought some catfish fillets and some jalapeño poppers for my wife (asked for cheddar ones) We got home and again the catfish was ok, but not impressive, mediocre at best. Also, the poppers were mixed cream cheese and cheddar so my wife couldn't even eat half of those.

I don't mind the wait for fresh food, especially from mom and pop type places..I will give alot of leeway. But in this instance the owner needs to do some work on his staff and flavor profile of the food before I return."}
{"text":"It's ok. Not really much to say. Was expecting shrimp to be fresh but it was the frozen kind you can find in most cheap Chinese takeout spots. Fish was seasoned decently. A pound here does not actually seem like a pound. Our pound of fish was about 5 smallish pieces..."}
{"text":"Great wings! Angel and the gentleman (sorry I didn't catch your name) gave amazing customer service and really hustled today.  Thank you guys for a fun tasty dinner!"}
{"text":"no one here cares about the customers or there job I walked in and was ignored and the guy who finally came to help after two other guys walked in. and I feel like the guy hated white people because when he helped me he seemed grumpy and when he helped the two black guys he was nice to them the wings were over cooked and the fries were bad"}
{"text":"OMG best wing spot! Great wings ! Great catfish! Great grape kool aid!! Reasonable prices and fast service , highly recommended"}
{"text":"Walked in for a small bite to eat and saw all kinds of fried stuff. Wings fish (multiple species), shrimp gizzards etc.  I was about to get some of the gizzards but the lady working there said it was wing day.

I looked at all their 19 sauces decided to go with sweet and sour, very bland and 3 of the 5 wings were undercooked. Normally I'd eat them but they were far from being done.  So I won't go back!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I love supporting small businesses whenever they open in our city of Las Vegas, but if you do please come with your game correct!  Wing Heaven was just a letdown.  

The concept is great, wings, fish, other fried delights.  But where Wing Heaven fails is in the execution of it all.  Just not what you would expect for a newer establishment.  I just couldn't give this place more stars if I tried.  If it was better when they first opened, then Wing Heaven should get back on the straight and narrow soon to keep patrons coming in at a good clip.  

Wing Heaven was a drive for us, a bit out of the way.  Entering the place, it is nice enough.  No tables if you plan on eating here, just a few stools and a flat screen TV or two for you to catch up on sports while you wait for your order.  And boy, did we WAIT.  It was a weekend night and it wasn't busy at all in the store.  There was one other couple ordering at the time.  1) We weren't greeted by the owner, or anyone in the place for that matter.  2) After the couple in front of us ordered, the owner and them proceeded to shoot the SH!+ with each other for at least 10 minutes (yes I timed them).  And not once did ANYONE greet us or tell us that they would be right with us.  A bit annoying.  3) When we finally did get to the register to place our order, the owner wasn't exactly friendly or welcoming with the wifey and I in his place.  Could be just that's his demeanor, but still, you want my continued business, please at least FAKE a smile to show some effort.  I got the whiff that his food was gonna speak for itself, so I figure I would just give it a chance.

We thought about the catfish (but I favor Mario's Westside for that), but ended up going with a pound of fried pollock because it was on special.  The seasoning we chose was Garlic Vinegar.  You know us Filipinos, lovin' our garlic and vinegar like it was salt and pepper.  The real reason we drove down to Wing Heaven was because my wife loves fried gizzards, and this was one of the only places I've heard of that serve them on a regular basis.  So we got a pound of those as well.  Paid, and proceeded to wait while our order was being prepared.  That was a long 10 minutes.  

Owner finally warmed up a bit and asked us if we liked cheesecake.  He said he was going to make us a treat to try out.  Yay, some life out of this guy.  A few minutes later we are given a cheesecake bite of sorts with chocolate and raspberry sauce on top.  It was OK.  But I was expecting something a bit more homemade.  These seemed like those cheesecake bites you get from your local warehouse store, just covered up in batter and fried.  Good effort, but wish it was more original.  Glad we were offered it though, it's the only reason I went and gave Wing Heaven another star.

Upon our take out order arriving I lifted the bag.  It really seemed LIGHT.  I had to ask behind the counter, \"Bro, you sure this fish is a pound?\"  Guy says yes.  I did the WRONG thing by just leaving with a \"Thanks\" and not checking on my order.

The wifey and I finally drive back to our side of town and get to sit down to enjoy our meal, and immediately are disappointed.  Our pound of fried fish seemed so measly!  It looks like they included the weight of all the seasonings BEFORE frying!  So sad.  Our fish pieces were so small, and much of our fish order was in tiny bite size pieces.  Just bad!  Lots of batter bits, and not much fish.  The only thing good about this was the Garlic Vinegar seasoning, it gave good tang to what was lackluster fish.  I wish I had remembered to take pics of this, but it was so upsetting I totally disregarded it.  But the wifey can vouch for this fish being just a disappointment.  It came with a tiny condiment container of cole slaw, but that wasn't so tasty either.  Needed more vinegar, and less mayo.  Tartar sauce?  Nothing special.

On to the fried gizzards, which were a letdown as well.  Granted, our trip to our eating area wasn't very far, I wasn't expecting our fried items to hold up the greatest because just about everything at Wing Heaven is packed to go (since they have no real eating area in house).  But the gizzards were rubbery!  Like shoe leather rubbery!  It can mean two things - either the gizzards were overcooked OR the gizzards are a frozen-type product and not fresh made.  No amount of Louisiana hot sauce could really save these gizzards from being yummy.  No bueno.

About $15 total for our order since we opted to not go the meal route, since it was our first time to Wing Heaven we wanted to feel out the food.  I really hate to say it, but looks like we won't be back anytime soon.  Maybe it was an off day for them, or maybe there are some kinks (one of the cooks seemed to be in training), but I just didn't connect with this place.  I know Wing Heaven specializes in wings but they just don't seem special compared to other wing joints.  Sorry, guys.  Disappointing.  Heaven this is not."}
{"text":"My favorite chicken wings by far! I love the food and the service is great. All the workers are so nice too! I love this place."}
{"text":"I'm giving it one star, and that's because the wings were actually DELICIOUS! 

The reason for my bad review is simple, the customer service sucked! The guy at the register was apparently having a bad day... Lemme rephrase that, bad life! ATTITUDE from the start. I asked how big the wings were, and the guy acted like I was asking for a free sample! Then when I asked to mix and match, I asked if I could have 4 wings in a separate sauce and he snapped at me \"we only do in 5's\"... Like if I already knew.

All in all, the wings were really good! I got the Jerk Sauce and Can honestly say it was very pleasing.

Wing Heaven needs to send their employee to a learn some manners. If you don't want to deal with people, get out of the food service industry! 

I hate to write bad reviews, but this guy really made my first experience at wing heaven a bad experience! At least the wings were good."}
{"text":"I went for the second time last night. My first visit was good as the wings were nice and crispy, yet juicy and spiced just right (I don't like sauces). 

Last night was a little disappointing. The owner was at the register when I walked up. He was busy pushing buttons on the cash register for a good minute then looked up at me, backed up, looked to his employee and pointed at me. No greeting to a paying customer???

I placed my order and waited for my wings. I was Pleased when they were done, but they forgot my boneless wings so they had to drop them in the fryer. 10 minutes later they were done and I left and went home (around the corner). My wings were just warm having sat in the styrofoam container and they were not crisp as they steamed themselves having been in the container so long. They did taste good though, but I like them crispy. 

My boneless wings were cooked to a crisp, way over cooked. They were so bad I threw them away. 

So in my experience it's 50-50."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing!
The seasoning is perfect on everything the boneless chicken wings are perfectly crispy the owner was such a pleasure to talk with and also gave us samples to try before we ordered!
I will recommend this place to EVERYONE!!
Extremely pleasant experience!!"}
{"text":"This place is cheap and supper clean inside. The workers are very helpful and friendly.  Large portions for the price you pay & the wings are pretty good also. Give it a  try its a family owned place."}
{"text":"Great Food!!!! Anybody who says otherwise needs their head examined!!! I've read the negative reviews, I take them with a grain of salt. This is a take out restaurant, not Wing Stop..... I even got my coworkers ordering food from here, so we love it!!!! Prices are comparable to any wing spot."}
{"text":"Rude, rude, rude. BW3 is closed for remodeling, but I will just forgo wings until they reopen. Wing heaven service is very poor, starting with hanging up on people trying to place orders, repeatedly, hour long waits for one 10 piece order of wings, and service staff who could not possibly care less if you're happy or even whether you come back. Nope, after two tries, I'm out. But if you're into surly, disdainful, eye rolling treatment, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"The management is rude... i ordered something and asked for it to be seasoned a certain way and he told me they don't salt to their fmfood any more.. i then proceeded to show him the option on the board and he got on the counter and took the option off the board and said problem solved... I've been coming here fairfully for a year and a half and this is what i get... never again."}
{"text":"Yummy wings and tasty fried okra and zucchini.  First time here and the place was packed. The \"regulars\" had phoned their orders ahead of time because everything is made to order.  Marcus handled preparing the orders, while there was a friendly front-end person who was patient and accomadating.  I ordered the garlic cheese parm flavor and honey heaven. I truly could not begin to tell you the which one tastes better - they were both delicious and light. Great wings with yummy sides...."}
{"text":"The best seafood Ive had since being in the midwest. Good quality food for great prices. I had problems with closing time before...talked with the manager and he addressed the issue no problem."}
{"text":"The wings are out of sight. Fresh wings, cooked perfectly and seasoned up exactly how you want is a recipe for success. The wings are so crispy and good!

I tried the chipotle bbq sauce which was actually really good. I would normally not order barbeque sauce but these had me convinced that it's not so bad."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! They specialize is wings and fish! But they also have fried oysters and shrimp which are seasoned to perfection!! The food here is really good and the customer service  is top notch!! The owner greeted me, took my order and was really personable!! I'm def coming BACK!!"}
{"text":"My husband went to get us some lunch, first time here. Awful customer service, man working was so rude and unwelcoming. Then He brought food home, he  ordered ten wings and got nine. I liked my wings , I got garlic Parmesan and they were good. He didn't like his. We try to go to local businesses  when we can, but we won't be back.  Just put off by the attitude."}
{"text":"I went here last night and it was amazing, I LOVE their different sauces that they have and so far I have never been disappointing. I definitely recommend that if you haven't already, definitely check it out because not only is it cheaper than \"wingstop\" it's even more flavorful. Oh and the cups that you get for drinks are HUGE, to be honest during the weight I finished a drink of coke before the order and I was already full haha"}
{"text":"Wow. Definitely don't judge a book by the cover. Orders spicy honey wings. They are perfect. Hot sweet crispy.  And dang you get a lot of food. Definitely will come back. Really really good, clean and friendly"}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place. I love to try new places and some boneless wings were  calling my name last night. We went ahead and decided on Wing Heaven, I could get delivery and the prices for a 20 count of boneless wings was pretty standard, not too much more expensive and it was for delivery.

    We decided on the 20 count boneless wings with three flavors (Honey BBQ, Honey Heaven and Garlic Parmesan) which comes with four sauces plus we ordered an extra side of ranch (extra charge) so 5 total, an order of fried zucchini, an order of macaroni and cheese bites and an order of their chili cheese fries. 

    The boneless wings were a let down, the Honey BBQ was okay but drenched in sauce (which I'm usually okay with) but the other two flavors were not. The Honey Heaven flavor was just okay too, lacked any kind of ooompf, but had almost no sauce and the Garlic Parmesan had NONE. It was a rub instead? Specifically on the website it says it's a Garlic Parmesan SAUCE, and it barely had any flavor at all. Some pieces were bigger than others, but then some were just a tiny bit of chicken and ALL breading. Then in the order it says we get FOUR sides of ranch plus our extra one side for the extra change. We only received three sides of sauce, missing one that came with it and the one we paid extra for. Very frustrating.

    The sides were also a let down, the chili cheese fries were bland (which I think would actually be a hard thing to achieve), and the fried zucchini and macaroni and cheese wedges were just garbage. Pre-frozen tasteless waste of money, I even tried to add some salt (nothing was seasoned) and it didn't help! We just threw it away. And to top it off we didn't even get any utensils to eat this food with. Luckily I had some new left over plastic from a previous food order I received. Not cool, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"I tried the Caribbean jerk - ok, honey BBQ- above average, and the garlic parmesan- great flavor but a little dry, service was friendly and food came out fast, but for the price it should have been amazing. It would have been about the same price to have gone down the road to Buffalo Wild Wings and somebody would have served it to me. Also, no sides included - ranch, carrot, celery, which I would have expected at the price, maybe they supply if you ask and I falsely assumed they would throw in. Will try again, but might have to wait for coupons or a deal"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed,  they advertise fresh fried wings and fish, fresh doesn't mean frozen, when ever your products are frozen they simply are not fresh! I ordered The catfish fillets, catfish nuggets and fries, The fries were pretty good and is the only reason that I gave this review one star, The catfish was just okay and nothing special other than the rubbery texture, very mushy inside not flaky at all. I will not waste my time nor my money on another visit. I must add that the staff was very friendly and helpful.
Wing Heaven is not the business!"}
{"text":"First time here and so excited! Food smells and tastes wonderful but you will return because of the owner. His hospitality, prompt service and however he makes the kool aid will definitely keep you coming! Super non expensive and great deals for lunch, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Les and Jose were sooo cool they have a great spot.. The staff is on point this place food is so Good we tried Wings  bomb diggity (that mean It's good ) 

Update: went on last Friday and it was disgusting every since Les left this place has gone down. The food is not good only the kool aid. They answer the phone like your bugging them even when the older gentleman answers. I gave it 5 stars before now it's barely 2. I'm never returning.. WHERE IS Les"}
{"text":"1st time tried this place was so so. Glad I gave them a 2nd try. Had the catfish, hot wings and cheese sticks. Catfish was really good. Picked seasonings I would use, was very tasty. Hot wings were perfect. Hubby had most of them..will def have to order more next time. Will be back.."}
{"text":"The wings were fries too hard and way over sauced. I also had some butterfly shrimp that were obviously frozen. I also ordered some loaded fries, after waiting forever the fries were still cold. The customer service is good but I will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me? Worst wing ever. Fatty crap with lots of gross sauce covering it. Ordered 6 wings shrimp fried rice $7.55 plus bottle water only thing goid was water. Wasted $10.00 the sign make you think they specialize in wings not true. A dive Chinese restaurant. I'm not happy could not finish eating this slop!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Not only is the food excellent, so is the customer service. I spoke with the owner about a prior concern and was very pleased with how he handled the situation.  I also tried the new crab boil option, it's a great option and a wonderful alternative especially with the lack of choices on this side of town. I feel better supporting locally owned businesses,  places like this enable me to do so without sacrifice :)"}
{"text":"Wednesday wing night!  .50 cent wings with so many flavors!  Personal fav was spicy garlic!  Great service and staff.  Nice to have a local spot when I'm too lazy to cook and want to pick up dinner.  I hear catfish is delish.... Will try on next visit!"}
{"text":"Trash trash trash dont wast your time or money kids working there that have no idea what there  doing management sucks ass"}
{"text":"Ace has taken care of us each time we've ordered from here, and their customer service is outstanding! Their food is just as amazing! We've had the fish, chicken, and the wings. It was all delicious, the wings are our favorite. Ask for them well done if you like a crispy wing. Bourbon and honey heaven sauce on the wings is highly recommended. Order in advance, because it does take about 20-30min for a family sized order, but its made fresh! Even better, they offer Grub hub delivery! They also have very reasonable pricing!"}
{"text":"Wanted to come by here for a while now, but I've been distracted by other wing places. This place was different. There is actually no where to eat. So order your wings ahead of time. They do Uber Eats and Grub Hub also. Seriously, there is no where to eat and it can get crowded standing against a wall.. there.. waiting.. waiting.. and waiting. Wings normally take 16-18 minutes to cook in a fryer. Mine took 33 minutes. Why did it take so long? Someone ordered their wings after me and got theirs before me. Irritating. Anyways, the guy at the register, \"D\" didn't seem too excited about his job. Leilani got our order prepared. After being irritated for a while and asking how much longer and being ignored.. I finally got my wings. I will say, the wings were spectacular! Skip the customer service part and order anyway you can ahead of time. 
#HoneyHeaven was a recipe passed down from the heavens above to this dive wing spot. Sweet savory flavor made it worth the wait. I also asked what was one of \"D's\" favorite wings and he said #WestCoastRub. It felt like I was in Cali with each bite of this delicious rub! The wings were great. 
Wings were heaven, customer service was hell.

{"text":"We ordered $50 worth of food that was supposed to come with about 45 wings two drinks two fries a couple of dipping sauces when the food came through Uber they forgot our fries, forgot our drinks and they forgot our dipping sauces all we got was the wings and I kind of find it weird that they don't check off the receipt to make sure the order is complete before they just give out Wings...... if you're going to offer combos make sure it's taken care of..... we pay the extra $5 to get delivery and a complete order..... it's also the restaurants fault for not making sure the order should have been completed. Sucks"}
{"text":"The worst wings I have ever had. I order lemon pepper they were flavorless, fries under season, everything tasted like fish and dripping oil. Save your money terrible food!"}
{"text":"I used to love Mom's when it was at this location and had high hopes for the replacement. I was not disappointed, nice menu and very convenient for carry out. The food is good with a nice selection of flavors and the wings are big, prices are okay and pretty much the same as BWW. Only bad thing I could say about the place was the staff, the guy who took my order wasn't the friendliest but I'll try again and see if there's an improvement. He might've just been having a bad day."}
{"text":"Man this is our new favorite wing place. We are from South California and we had our favorite wing place out their, once we moved out here we only had the option of Buffalo Wild Wings and they are okay but not great. Once we found this place and tried their wings also their fried talapia was great. Very delicious place to eat i highly recomend it."}
{"text":"Get food here for lunch pretty regularly. I always get the chicken, shrimp and beef in black pepper sauce. I'd call it a hole in the wall. Very delicious food, great value, and friendly staff. Portions are a good size for the price. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love this place, great service, great food, best wings in town! I stop here at least once a week for a quick bite to go, the guys are always so glad to see you and super fun with football going on in the background. They're loyalty program is super fun and easy, and they have really good specials and fair prices..."}
{"text":"Wing heaven definitely was not my idea of sketchy, I would call it a \"hole in the wall\" it's easy to miss if you're not looking up at the tiny white sign . The inside was very clean , service was fast and friendly . 

The menu was limited, not a lot like other Chinese restaurants, but they had your average dishes like General Tso, etc. I ordered the pepper steak and added broccoli. The portion size was average , enough to overly fill your belly . You have the option of an egg roll or spring rolls. I chose the spring roll and wasn't impressed, but like most Chinese restaurants this spring roll tasted bland , filled with cabbage and onions . My pepper steak didn't have a distinctive taste , it wasn't bad but I wouldn't order it again . I love the fact the steam white rice was an Asian brand vs . American. Asian rice is sticker and doesn't fall apart . I gave Wing Heaven 3Stars because my co-worker enjoyed his General Tso chicken, and the prices were fairly cheap , if I had to base it on my meal 2.5 , but this will not defer me from going back . Sometimes you may not order the right thing"}
{"text":"Will where do I start... good service over All and the food was fresh but it had no taste at all. Also I ordered a spring roll that I never got to tease because they did not put it in the bag so I just left it didn't bother to call about it. probably was tasteless as well.."}
{"text":"I'm a wing lover and decided to try this place out. Glad I did. Great tasting wings. The staff was great too. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"I really like the food from this location. However the service and attitude and ability to properly fulfill an order makes the place infuriating and not worth going to. The last several orders we have placed from this location have all been incorrectly filled and 20 minutes or more late in being prepared."}
{"text":"Had the spicy garlic wings and mozzarella sticks. I was shortened on my wings, paid for a 10 piece, and I only got 9. The sauce is more oily than traditional sauces. The mozzarella sticks were over cooked, and all of the cheese spilled out of the breading. Even if they were cooked correctly, wouldn't recommend them. Your marinara sauce will come cold, I was told it's because it's canned and can't be kept warm, because they don't sell a lot of it. I was offered a free replacement to fix my order, but I never went back. Just didn't want to unfortunately."}
{"text":"After hearing an interesting new menu choice had surfaced in the neighborhood fry house, it was with hopeful, yet realistic, expectations that I decided to give WH another go.

A friendly welcome by the much larger appointed staff accompanied a much less desirable heat from the lack of air conditioning on this August summer night.  There are still no tables or chairs to eat from, inside or outside of the restaurant...so even as a to-go spot, slight comfort is not found.

But all is not lost!  The aforementioned Chicken & Waffles....Great wing-style C&W, dense waffle batter, charred crisp edges, topped with powdered sugar and maple. Wings are covered in the same syrup, with a subtle caramel-like sweetness. Delicious!  I could NOT get enough waffles....easily trumping the chicken and most other waffle varieties I've encountered in the recent months.  Recommended!

I also ordered the Lemon Pepper and Caribbean Jerk Wings. The Jerk a bit sweeter than the chain competition, less spice and a bit dull in flavor to the latter. Lemon Pepper has good taste, dry rubbed and cooked well, just difficult to beat the other chain champ at Lemon Pepper!  Don't compare, and you should enjoy these :)

Too bad the Seasoned French Fries were under-cooked. Starchy and limp....besides the cook time, they could go heavier on the seasoning.  I'm sure it was just a bad batch, but consistency was my issue during the first visit that remained unpleasant, even a couple days after my meal here, if you catch the drift.

Come try the Chicken & Waffles!"}
{"text":"Great wings, but notorious for having slow wait times. Also, the potato wedges with cheese and and bacon is really cheese whiz with dried parsley."}
{"text":"I haven't even tried the food yet, but all of the reviews on the staff are exactly right. They had both the radio and the sports game volume topped out so you couldn't even hear yourself think. I called to place my order and the guy on the phone couldn't hear me either. Then when I come to pick up the food, there were several individuals walking around pointlessly but they still didn't even acknowledge I was there. I still can't get over the fact of how freaking loud it was. If I could take a pic and post it I would."}
{"text":"My new fav wing spot in Vegas! I got the chicken and waffles around when they first started to serve them! Since then I've been back 4 times, all the same order! I always see people ordering the seafood menu items  when I go in so I might assume that they are delicious as well. I will try something else sooner or later but that chicken and waffles has got me hooked! Never have I been dissatisfied with my order here. Once I've tried more items I will write another review."}
{"text":"Hands down the best wings in LV.......3 stars because the food was good. However, I understand that there will be kinks in any new operation (it's to be expected). But over time, some Kim's should be worked out. My first visit I got told how much chicken and how many flavors I had to order due to the restaurant being slammed and was informed that it would be a 30 minute to a 1 hour wait. Then when inquiring about other menu items my questions weren't even answered I just kept getting told the more food I ordered the longer the wait would be. I was perfectly fine with waiting since I had heard so much about the place and they were obviously slammed. Then was finally advised to only order chicken cause they didn't have time to make anything else. Completely disappointed. Don't tell me how much and what I can and cannot order especially when I was willing to wait and was prepared to spend a pretty penny. 

My second visit was a little disappointing as well. I ordered chicken, fish, fries and mac bites. Well.... I am allergic to catfish to the point my throat closes this making it hard to breathe. My chicken was in a separate container, but everything else was put into the same container. I assumed that each item would be put into a different container considering they were all different and no combos were ordered. Now if I were to eat the food in the same container as the fish.......let's just say today wouldn't have gone as smoothly as it did. I returned inside to get my orders remade, the gentleman was very nice and replaced my food. He apologized and said he would have a talk with whoever Boles my order. My point is that it all the food should not have been together in one container. Also I did not see any signs pertaining to allergies or \"seafood prepared here sign\", I could have over looked it. Bottom line is, the food is great, but still some kinks to be worked out."}
{"text":"What kind of restaurant doesn't have tables for customers to eat on? What are we supposed to eat on? I guess they just want their customers to just order their food and go. As for the food it wasn't bad, it wasn't great either. I think they season their wing a lot better then some of the other chicken wing restaurants but the quality of chicken isn't very good either."}
{"text":"Should be named Wing HELL!! Not only was the order incorrect (2 of the 3 sauces were tossed when specifically asked for on the side), the portion sizes were EXTREMELY out of balance with most of the \"boneless wings\" being nothing but batter pieces."}
{"text":"This was our first time ordering from here. So, first of all, the service was not that good at all. They close at 10pm, we arrived at approx 9:15pm. The cook, a young man, loudly complained\" We're still getting orders? I wanna get out of here!\" Not exactly professional.  They then messed up our drink order and forget our fried Mac and cheese order.
Now, the food....extremely delicious! Everything fried and seasoned to perfection.  The catfish was extremely mild and didn't taste muddy at all. So, we'll give it another shot, but if we hear complaints about taking our order, we'll take our $$ elsewhere."}
{"text":"My boyfriend orders wings no matter where we go. In fact, I blame him for my decreased restaurant experiences. He hates trying anything new that isn't deep fried, or battered. Wing Heaven was right up his alley and I decided I would order Garlic Parmesan wings with him. I didn't want any fries so I went to Panda Express and got a side of noodles. He ordered Medium wings, catfish and French fries. The garlic wings were good but they were EXTREMELY salty!! I realized instead of using fresh garlic as the main flavor, they used garlic salt and or powder. Luckily for me I had the Panda chow mein which is normally bland and it balanced the saltiness out. I took a bite of one of his catfish fillets and wasn't too impressed. It was a bit rubbery and luke warm. C'mon, we called ahead of time so either that was cooked first, or cooked way in advance. We sat in the restaurant waiting for the food, so it wasn't like we were late picking it up. It didn't have that hot crunch you normally get from freshly fried fish. I was expecting to take a bite of steamy flaky fish. Instead, it reminded me of a junior high cafeteria. FISH STICK FRIDAY. They gave me a ranch dipping sauce and after I dipped a wing in it and tasted it, it was sour-like or spoiled! I threw it away. The last thing I needed was food poisoning. \"Ain't nobody got time for dat!\"
Although I was starving and the last meal I had was at 11am that day and it was now 8pm, I did enjoy the wings. In the middle of the night, I woke up a bit dizzy and had a terrible leg cramp that had me in tears. That never happens to me so I wonder if it was all of the salt?
Overall the staff was extremely friendly. They offered me a sample of crab meat and I declined since I'm not a crab eater, but everyone was full of humor and smiles. I wouldn't say this is my first choice when it comes to greasy food joints, but it's one of those places where if you're hungry, it's kinda getting late, and you're still in your pajama's, you're feeling lazy, the gas tank is low, it was kinda a crappy day at work, you want to engage with others as little as possible, your not trying to spend a lot of money, or tip, and you don't want to drive far, you come here. Haha."}
{"text":"Wow.  Yummmm.  I got chicken and broccoli with garlic sauce.  Probably the best I have ever had.  Absolutely phenomenal.  Very large portions and Very reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"This mid West southern comfort style mini restaurant is the best chicken and fish spot in Vegas I wish there were more location thanks for having me but if you go you must try that white shrimp seasoned and there honey heaven Wings or chicken and waffles with a large red koolaid southern style"}
{"text":"Haven't tried the food yet but the service is excellent! Feels like I showed up at my cousin's house for lunch!! : )"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst experience I've ever had at a food place. When I tried to call in to order someone answered but barely knew how to place my order and then hung up on me so I decided to just go in and place my order. The cashier didn't know what she was doing at all and I waited 45 minutes for 30 chicken wings that weren't that good. Very poor experience.
.... and let me not forget that my order total was $27.07 and I paid $26 in cash and the rest on my card which SHOULD HAVE BEEN $1.07 but they charged me the full amount and trying to get it reversed has been a headache because the owner won't own up to his associates mistake. Get it together."}
{"text":"Best wings in town hands down Hot barbecue on point... Great service lemon piper catfish next level food always the same consistency..."}
{"text":"Great Fried Shrimp! I didn't know they existed !! The hot & teriyaki wings ARE SOOO GOOD!! Friendly service too"}
{"text":"We were out shopping and a clerk at the store suggested this place.  Its an old Pizza Hut and our expectations were low bases on the exterior.  Delicious, fresh chinese food.  Friendly staff and amazingly clean!  Highly reccomend."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The catfish is awesome and the wings were tasty. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Just drove into the shopping center and they are GONE!  Sign on the door said it's going to be a Chinese food place, anyone know if they Are going to relocate or what?!?"}
{"text":"Food was okay I ordered shrimp fried rice and paid a extra $2 for shrimp that was smaller then a dime. Location clean and staff do their job not super friendly but not rude."}
{"text":"First time there. Got to tell ya, was initially concerned when I first walked in. No dine in tables. Worked hard that day and wanted to sit and enjoy my meal. Fountain drink dispenser had broken Dr. Pepper. I love  Dr. \"P\". Regardless, I ordered ten piece wings (medium sauce), bacon and cheddar wedges, and a large coke. Total came to 17.05. I was like wow!!! Now, if the food is good, I'll pay that all day. Folks, I got to tell ya, those where the best damn wings I've ever had in my life!!!!!! The bacon cheddar wedges where out of this world. Those fellas know how to cook up some sinful delicious food. Proportion size was great!!!! I'm a big man. Filled me up. I'm going back!!!!! Found a new favorite spot. Mind you once you order you'll be waiting a minute while they fry up your food. That is why it is so good!!!!!! Be patient, it's worth it. Wing Heaven get you some sit-down tables, I would love to eat at your establishment!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the negative comments about the service. We found this place by chance one night searching for a place to get dinner. They were amazing and attentive even though they were pretty busy and there were only two people working. They were close to closing and we didn't exactly order small either and they had the order done in 20 minuets which is basically just the time to fry the wings and that's great that they were able to keep up with the pace and still stay as attentive and friendly as they were. They didn't ignore us once and we actually held a great conversation the second time we had stopped in. I definitely plan and going in more often the food is great and flavorful and the people are amazing and so super friendly."}
{"text":"Catfish so good it'll make you slap your mamma. Serious bussiness, a hidden gem in the northwest."}
{"text":"So I just called to order food from this place and they're out of everything they don't have any of the family specials it's ridiculous it's Friday night and they don't have any food I don't get it"}
{"text":"I  came here on a recommendation from a friend, I love catfish and being from the south (GA) I've yet to find catfish that comes close to being prepared that way.  I used to think that Hush Puppy was it, not any more.  Wing Heaven has the most flavorful, crispy and lightly breaded fish you will ever eat. Their wings are the absolute bomb! I cannot emphasize how good the customer service is.  You cannot go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Terrible wings. I ordered on Uber Eats at 4:42 PM, the wings were finally ready after an hour to prepare. I ordered mild and upon delivery, the plastic bag was completely filled with grease. The wings were literally just fried with no sauce or flavor and the bottom of the box was filled with grease as well. The only part of the order that was okay (just okay, not great) was the side of chili cheese fries. Definitely not ordering again. For the same price and time i could have ordered BWW and gotten better quality wings with flavor and picked them up before i received my order from Wing Heaven"}
{"text":"I came across this spot thanks to Yelp! 

My food respectfully tasted like chicken, so that much I definitely appreciated. However, the seasoning of everything was just ok. I would definitely try this place again, just maybe try something different other than the Sesame Chicken... besides, the staff was really nice."}
