{"text":"Awesome shisha, lemon mint drink is fantastic.  Only downside is extremely slow service when you order anything"}
{"text":"These guys are rude, firstly they have no ice pipe so don't even bother ordering it because it'll be added to your bill without you knowing. If you want to be served be sure you're there by 8 no later then 9-930, you'll wait forever and if you're a regular who spends more then the average smoker you'll be replaced by a group of females who walk right in  even though you been waiting for 45 mins in the line. They had seats available but didn't give it to us instead gave it to someone else, tried putting us in the walkways how can u fit 5 guys if you're workers can barely walk through it ? Gave us wet chairs from outside those cheap plastic patio chairs, shisha average at best I like the idea of orange head but half the time you ask for a flavor and it tastes nothing like it . Beautiful interior however it needs tidying and cleaning up there's dust everywhere. We left without ordering, and he said there's nothing I can do, okay won't be back then buddy."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Terrible food. Staff is very rude and unwilling to explain anything on their menu. I would recommend looking for other shisha places around this area which are alot cleaner, better environment, and most of all nicer staff ! You have been warned proceed with caution here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Never seen same before .I do really love this place.

Amazing in everything ....
Service,food,hospitality and much much more."}
{"text":"Awesome environment and hookah was amazing. Amazing customer services and love the music. It's really hype"}
{"text":"Love the personal attention I get here. My favourite's the double apple on orange head, and the hearty serving of Phili steak sandwich. Have never been disappointed with a visit yet! It's my goto place for chilling out. What a weekend this is turning out to be. You can spend hours  without getting bored, making smoke rings. The mood and atmosphere here is Perfect. Although I'm not into Arabic music, I guess it's part of the authentic experience. Plenty of space, without the typical stuffy sheesha smoke feeling from others. There's an outdoor patio, but I was never a fan of that. If you want to play cards, chess or that Arabic board game- all you need do is ask for it. There's also bamyan and burger factory in the same plaza, if you want to eat something like that after. But I always like ordering here, with the sheesha.

They have some fancy flavours like vanilla and what not, but I'm a man of habit. 

It's a new place and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone in Mississauga who's out with friends, a special someone or just wants some solo chilling out.

Here's my secret smoke ring technique: when you exhale, just say the alphabet 'O' and you'll be making rings in no time. Happy showing off!"}
{"text":"Shisha is average , food is very bad needs to improve we ordered chicken burger it was horrible. Belly dancing is pretty good . Overall just ok ok ."}
{"text":"Beautiful on the inside. Decorated and designed to follow a traditional and authentic arab look. Great food! Only problem I had was when my server brought my table the wrong order and didn't tell us until we were halfway through eating. He literally goes, \"btw do you like your sandwich? I got you the shawarma sandwich instead of the kafta one. Sorry.\" Aside from that this place is great! Great music."}
{"text":"food was decent but had to ask four times before getting a simple hummus.... skip out on the orange fruit head, ended up killing our shisha way too early! 

if you're looking for a decent atmosphere with rough service but good vanilla shisha this is your spot"}
{"text":"Might be a bit long. But worth reading. 

The only reason I gave this place is a 1 star because I truly believe customer service comes before anything. I have been coming to this lounge for nearly 8 months now. However my last visit was the worst experience I've ever had within the restaurant business. 
I had guests over from overseas that had a layover in Toronto for a few hours. Took them to downtown showed them the sights. And 2 hours before the flight I thought I'd take them to my spot, shishalicious. They weren't really interested in smoking but I told them they serve food and drinks as well. Got there, one of the guys got us a nice spot to sit. And while going to the spot assigned the manager comes yelling asking me what I was doing. I calmly told him one of your guys had told us to take a seat here. He stares dead into my eyes walks up close to me as if he was gonna start a fight. Tells me \" buddy I'm the manager no one is allowed to sit until I say so\". He kept implying as if I was lying. So I see the guy who I initially met walking out of the kitchen and I point out to the manager he's the one who got us these seats. He went running to the guy and started confirming if what I had said was true. During his 2 min conversation with his guy he kept point his finger at me very aggressively. And right then I should've know to get out of the restaurant. But mind you, the guests were standing right next to me and were observing the whole drama going on. So his guy walks up to us and takes us to the table. And I could tell the manager was still staring at us. As soon as we place an order to the guy which summed up to around $50 the guy said my manager instructed me to take A MINIMUM ORDER OF $100 from you. 
3 PEOPLE,, $100. 
The shitshow went on for about 10 minutes and then asked us to leave. I was so embarrassed. I kept emphasizing the fact that I have guests with me. Don't do this to me. They showed no mercy and asked us to empty the chairs. Everyone was starring at us while walking out. As I was leaving the staff including the manager had the biggest smirks on their faces. 

You guys probably thinking but why would he do that?
Only one reason. 
Because I proved the manager wrong. He was so confident that I was bullshiting my way through just trying to get a place to sit. 
And as soon as I pointed toward the guy who got us the seats and he told him that yes indeed it was him who told us to sit there, any 10 year old could tell by looking at his facial expression that he was feeling like he had lost all his fortune just by being wrong. 
Very funny though. The many times I came in with by boys and girl friends, never had a problem. They'd be happy to get us a seat. The one time I come in with an older and simple couple, this is what I run into. 

Never going back here ever again. Made sure non of my friends do either. 

You guys just lost 25-30 frequent clients. 



Really hope this helps 
Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"Food and ambiance are good .. they need to work hard on customer service.. they tend to forget about you !"}
{"text":"This place has great Shisha but I think the food looks delicious here too. We always come after we had dinner but I always regret that as soon as I sit down and see how delicious the Mediterranean food actually looks. I always see tons and tons of families in here but what I don't understand is how they have such poor insulation. There's smoke everywhere and you literally cannot breathe every time I go I have to make sure I take a double dosage of my allergy medicine so I can actually breathe"}
{"text":"Was wanting to try my first hookah as I call it , in Toronto and this was a good treat . The flavor however burnt out quick . The atmosphere was good and well ventilated for hookah smoking . I give it a 4 because of their food which was just average ."}
{"text":"General information: 

A huge shisha place with a patio. You can pay cash, debit, or credit and very loud music.

Now lets get into the details of my visit. I went there last friday with two of my friends.

Interior and environment: ***

The interior is kind of an authentic middle eastern kind of thing but you can tell that no one is taking care of the place as a lot of the corners are dirty and the wallpapers are peeling off. 

The environment there is extremely loud and crowded. Its nice if you are looking to go smoke shisha and enjoy the loud music and all of that but if you are thinking to go relax and chill this spot is not for you.

Service: * 

Horrible, horrible , horrible. I feel bad saying that because i believe that they tried their best but it was just horrible. When we arrived there was at least 4 tables that are available but they were for 4 and 5 ppl. I have told the manager that we would be ordering alot of shisha,food,&drinks so we are going to need a bigger table.

Instead of them giving us one of the tables they had available for 4-5 ppl they could \"only\" offer us a table of 2 and added a chair on that table. The table was barely enough to put our phones and wallets let alone all the food and drinks we ordered.

Literally asked the manager to move us more that one explaining that we are going to order a pot of tea and 6-7 plates that will not fit on the table but we just got ignored. Anyways past that we had to wait 25 minutes to place our order. 30 more minutes to get our food. 

At the end you have to go wait in line and pay at the cash. Our bill came up to $145 and i was looking at the bigger groups that they gave the tables that we wanted and they only have one shisha and the other tables 2 shishas. So the manager/owner tried to make as much money as possible from the big tables and ended up making way less than our 10 cm table in the middle of the hallway.

Shisha: **

Shishas :

We have ordered 2 grapemint and a double shisha . Shishas here are only served on orange heads. It took 30 mins for our shishas to come. I had to return mine because it wasnt pulling and then they kind of fixed and brought it back. Make sure you request a new hose because the ones we got served were really dirty.


Food: ***

We have ordered the following:

Hummus with beef shawarma: **

not bad, the beef is definitely not from a shawarma skewer but it was good enough.

Saj chicken shawarma: ****

this one was really good and it tasted like real shawarma and combination of flavour was on point.

Cheese and beef manakeesh: **

Cheese was okay and there was barely any beef on the beef manakeesh.


Washrooms: **

On a friday night you cannot expect a spotless washroom and it was kind of dirty and toilet paper was everywhere on the floor.

Conclusion: 

According to this visit my rating would be barely 2 stars but only because i know they can so much better and i have had better experiences here ill leave it at 3 stars. 

Worth a visit but ONLY if you are in the area definitely not worth the drive.

{"text":"The latest entry in the shisha craze which is hitting Mississauga.  I still have memories of the pub/ sports bar that used to be there before. They have redecorated somewhat but more still needs to be done.
Most people weren't eating the food but we had standard types sandwiches, hummus... Next time I will eat beforehand as the food was only ho hum and the setup is not conducive for eating much. 
$7 for juice smoothie I can live with but what was really outrageous is the fact they don't serve regular tap water and you must buy bottled water. 
Still this place has potential and if I were to return I would definitely come after eating and enjoy some Turkish coffee or mint tea and smoke up."}
{"text":"Alike many horrible stories heard across the eons of time this one must be heard as well. I don't quite know where to start but I will do my best at entailing the horrible experience I have underwent here with my friends. First off what's with the crowded lineup? Have these people never imagined falling through the demographic of appointment setting pre-preemptively? I felt like I was in a slaughterhouse awaiting my turn to get bludgeoned by the butchers they call hosts in this place. The music is terrible and loud in so many ways my grandchildren will hear these disgusting vibrations in their sleep. If I could rate this place with the flexibility of full mathematics I'd give it a -5, and that's being kind. Absolutely horrible experience."}
{"text":"I have many experiences about this place . I went me and other friends as group there every single time I go with my friends .they always add something we didn't order it and my friends pay for their own bill . They alway over charge us . I don't recommend people to go there or if you go as group make sure you check your items before you pay it off .Too much smoke , loud music  hard to find parking food tasteless some of waiters  rude  and hard to deal with ."}
{"text":"Fast service, attentive staff, clean environment and they have entertainment. 

I visited this place while in Toronto and must say it makes a good night out with friends. The music isn't over powering for your conversations and the place is super clean. 

We got to experience the belly dancing here on a Friday night and was quite fun.

Good place to just chill and seating is comfortable as well."}
{"text":"Best place to get a shisha. This my 6 time here and the staff is very friendly and the food is great. Best shisha I have tried so far the the famous Shishalisous mix and it's the best fruit mix shisha. Also the shawarma is very good and tasty. Friday night rhey have a very nice belly dance show. Very good guys keep up the excellent work."}
{"text":"Nice hookah cafe with a good vibe. They have Mexican, Indian, sushi, shawarmas, steak and burgers. One heck of a pot luck offerings. Our server Kashish was kick ass, quite charming and attentive. Service was quick. Overall loved the place and their choice of music from middle eastern to punjabi to Western . One heck of a Shishalicious place to be!!"}
{"text":"Pulled out this app after waiting for 20 minutes for someone to come by. Initially had to ask for a menu, then go up to ask to order only to be turned down and told to wait for some other guy who never came....."}
{"text":"Too loud, too busy, too dirty!
The place is big in size, so you would have a better experience on a week day where it isn't too busy.
But man oh man, is it a jungle on the weekends! The place is way overcrowded, with ppl lining up, chairs are rubbing against each other, with too many clouds of smoke!
On top of all this, they bring in live belly dancers on weekend nights, poor thing skips and maneuvers between tables.
Shisha and food are both about average, service is okay on weekdays, but weekends are tough to get anything, although they always seem to be well staffed, but they can't catch up..
It's a choice, but there a lot of better organized options in that area."}
{"text":"I came here for the shisha. I came back for the food. 

The place is very nicely decorated. It reminded me of Dubai (the only place I've been in the Middle East). It's a perfect set up for a hookah restaurant. 

Speaking of hookah, the selection is almost perfect. The set up is top notch. The only suggestion I have is to offer ice hoses. They do have ice hookahs but not the ice hoses. It's okay because it still tasted awesome. 

The service was excellent my first visit. The second visit was good. Overall, the service is great. 

The place gets packed. It's a very big spot with inside and outside seating. I'm sure it can tough to get a place to sit on busy nights. I didn't have that problem but it was almost packed every time I've been here. 

Let me tell you about the food. It's the best Kafka I ever had. I've had a lot of Middle Eastern food. Persian is still my favorite but this place is a very close number two of M.E. foods. But for sure, it's number one in Arabic food. I will absolute return for the food and the hookah. 

I was very impressed. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Okay restaurant. Food was delicious but a little greesy. Sheesha was average. Have had better at places like Haze and El Fishawy. The thing we really didnt know was that they charge you gratuity already so dont pay a tip! They dont tell you this whichh is really annoying."}
{"text":"Been here 4 or 5 times, surprisingly service is great every single time. The hosts/hostesses come around every few minutes to check if you need anything.

- Good music
- Good shisha (made in an orange head so it lasts longer)
- Good service
- Good food
- Open late on weekends

If you're there on a late night, remember that they collect their Shisha's and close their kitchen at 2:30AM."}
{"text":"Nicely set up...ambiance is exactly what you would expect. The cleanliness impressed me. The staff were very attentive and sweet. We chose to sit outside and that was just as nice and relaxing. We went on a Thursday night around 8 therefore it wasn't crowded at all. The shisha was very good. There are no traditional bowls, just fruit but that wasn't bad at all. The lemon mint was quite smooth and the mix was strong and nice. The food was average along with be tea. The Arabic coffee was lovely. Very nice spot."}
{"text":"Very chill hookah bar with yummy treats and tea... Service was so-so. Price was okay but not cheap. Will likely come back on weekends for belly dancing!"}
