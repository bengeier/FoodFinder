{"text":"From a food critic it goes like this. When we started going at Ne?s almost everything was great. Since Jimmy (co-owner) left the quality as well as the quantity had declined significantly.   e.g; 1) Food arrives cold  2) Inconsistent amount of ingredients   3) Fries are overcooked and burned  4) Terry (behind the kitchen) is rude and arrogant, etc...  5) Short staff and 45min average wait time to be served.    We will never return to this restaurant again. As paying customers they were unwilling to resolve the issues when addressed and we were asked to stop ordering. Wow terrible customer service ! We wish that Jimmy was still around as things were much better.    Recommendations for Greek food:  1) Tripolis  (514) 277-4689 2) Panama (514) 276-5223 3) Nostos (514) 388-1981  4) Village Grecque (514) 274-4371"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!! My boyfriend and I used to be regular customers.   Jimmy, one of the co-owners left, and now the food always arrives cold, or the order is messed up. We've complained multiple times about the issues, hoping that they would get their act together. NOT THE CASE, THEY DON'T CARE. Quality and service has gone down hill since they opened.    Expect to be scolded if you dare to point out the fact that they've made a mistake. Shame on you Terry, we are paying customers!!! We will never come back to your restaurant."}
{"text":"Très bonne place pour déguster des plats traditionnels grecs! Le gyro au poulet est très bon...la moussaka est un peu bizarre car il me semble avoir détecté de la cannelle! Mais ça reste très bon! Le lieu est propre et neuf et vous pourrez même repartir avec quelques produits typiques de leur petit rayon épicerie! Les prix sont tout à fait honnêtes! Vos plats peuvent être commandés sur internet et livres ou à emporter!"}
{"text":"I honestly cannot get enough Greek food, it is  so delicious and Montreal shines through in this field.  This place has been open for about a year, the first thing that I noticed is how friendly the waitresses are. They know the menu inside out and seem to be so at ease.  The positive vibe and modern decor helps to make the food so much better. And it's already great to begin with.  This is the kind of Greek restaurant that only serves Greek food. No pizza, subs, poutine etc.  The souvlaki pita has this charred smoky taste , I love the chicken as well as gyros. They have these amazing Greek potatoes but ran out last time so I got fries/rice last time. It's good but I'll choose the potatoes every time.  Another wonderful thing they have is a Cretan salad. It's similar to a Greek salad but the cheese is different and they add a red wine dressing and rusk bread. As a side dish it was gigantic and kind of hard to find in Montreal.  It's pretty well located and as central as it gets, about 5 minutes walk from jarry metro and right off St-Laurent boulevard. In the summer, Jarry park is nearby for a nice picnic idea."}
{"text":"Amazing greek food; everything was fresh and delicious, service was prompt and friendly.  The best place to enjoy a great summer dinner and drinks on their terrace."}
{"text":"I was probably Greek in a past life, that's how much I love the food and the people.  I didn't know what to expect from Neos, because my only previous exposure had been in Complexe Desjardins, where it was a step above food-court fare. They earned their five stars, for many reasons: The food is super-fresh, non-processed, and honest. The pikilia was artfully presented, and contained all the usual suspects, including grilled spanakopita and tiropita.  The grilling added a delicious flavour to the filo.  I could have stopped there, but that's not how I roll, so I soldiered on to the platter with two chicken souvlakis, Greek potatoes and salad.  All were superb.  My son and his girlfriend enjoyed their pork souvlaki immensely, and the fries were awesome as well. The crew are super-friendly, the service is attentive and well-paced.  All the food is prepared with love and attention to detail.  They have their own branded olive oil from Crete, which I will buy next time.  And there will be a next time!!"}
