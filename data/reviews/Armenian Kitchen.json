{"text":"this spot is a small, quiet, \"hole in the wall\" type of place that I would have never thought to try if I didn't read the yelp reviews. They are accurate, the place has great food. The decor is pretty traditional and the place is kind of dark...but not dirty or anything. Even the washrooms were very clean. It was a bit chilly though. I got the vegetarian platter with chicken shawarma. It comes with 3 falafels, hummous, baba ganoush and taboule as well as chicken shawarma. The chicken was very good, they use breast meat instead of the usual leg meat most shawarma restaurants use. The falafels were a little bit hard if they weren't eaten right away, but still very tasty. The platter was large and I couldn't finish it.  My boyfriend got the chicken shawarma platter. It came with salad and rice. The salad had a nice dressing. He wasn't really a fan of the rice, but he isn't a rice person to begin with. They served 3 large pitas with our meals...we only ate 2.  All in all this place had pretty good food so I will probably be back again!"}
{"text":"solid middle eastern food in scarb. always hits the spot, pretty good fries too."}
{"text":"I have been going regularly to AK for 25 years .... this alone is a great review in a city like TO where restaurants come and go.  Don't be put off by the location or the appearance.  The food is authentic and fabulous.  I never leave without food to take home - hummous, baba and tabouleh in summer ... lentil soup in winter.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Ordered fries and lentil soup and a Coke to drink. Lentil soup was a little chalky but not bad. The home made fries were burnt and greasy and came at separate times rather than together. Salt shaker had dried bits of brown things which I presume were rice in it.  The service was okay."}
{"text":"This is a favourite lunch place for locals - inexpensive, delicious, decent service. The strip-mall ambiance leaves something to be desired, but really, just helps me focus on how good everything tastes.  This is straight up middle eastern food: falafel, tabbouleh, shawarma, etc. I especially recommend the 'veggie platter with meat' (actual menu item)."}
{"text":"Armenian kitchen is the best shawarma place in the city because their beef shawarma is very tender and fresh so is the chicken, not fatty at all. Best falafel they make it fresh and the spicy garlic fries are to die for. Prices are good and the service is fair but get take out you don't want to eat there."}
{"text":"No exaggeration, this is the worst restaurant i have ever been to! Horrible food cold food old food ... Absolutely terrible. Worst is that i brought my parents with me bc this was recommended to me. We ordered shawarma plates and the food came to our table super quickly so we wondered how could that be! Chicken was leftover cold with no flavours at all. We kept it nice and did not complain. We could not finish our plates n waitress wondered how come but we paid and left and will never ever come back to this disgusting place. I am not sure why people r raving about this place - r we tasting sane food.   People please save your money and do not step foot in this sorry of an excuse resto.    TERRIBLE"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Middle Eastern restaurant I have been to that has left me satisfied.  I enjoy their Schwarma dinner, which includes meat of your choice, Falafel, Tabouleh, Hummas, Babaganoush and PIta bread... all for approximately $14.  I do not recommend the Schwarma sandwiches here (they put very minimal toppings in the sandwiches) or going for the decor."}
{"text":"This place needs some attention.  It has, hands down, the best falafel in the city.  Nobody even comes close to these golden brown, crispy on the outside, perfectly cakey in the middle, seasoned to perfection orbs of ecstasy.   It's an unassuming place to say the least, located in a strip mall on a block of strip malls and apartment buildings on Victoria Park, it has a small sign and very understated and dated decor.  But as Medhat stated in his review, it's all about the food.  The best way to experience the Armenian Kitchen is to go with a group of six or more and get platters. The veggie platter has labneh (pressed yogurt), baba ghanoush, hummus, tabbouleh and a few falafels (these will not be enough, order more!).  The lamb with hummus is delicious and used to be a good choice, but the price went up to almost $20, so stick with the chicken shawarma plate for the carnivores, it's well seasoned and just crispy enough.  The beef shawarma is very good as well, but I generally stick with the chicken.  The fries are delicious, but often just act as filler, wasting space that could be used for falafel!  If you are feeling especially meaty, have a kufteh, lamb meatball stuffed with pine nuts. For dessert, you can't go wrong with baklava and armenian coffee, a perfect ending to a perfect Armenian meal! The coffee is like espresso-tar, but really delicious and highly caffeinated. Warning: do not drink the sludge at the bottom!  All this is served with (virtually) unlimited pitas and pickle plates, hot sauce and tahini.  It's a unique communal dining experience; and if you love falafel, and I know you do, go now and take me too!"}
{"text":"Solid place for casual dining.  You get a lot of food for the price.  -Recommend the the Vegetable Combo Plate with Meat ($12.99). -Wouldn't order the New York Steak.  Steak was dry but fries was good. -Comes with pita bread  $25 for 2 and you come out completely full with leftovers to take home."}
{"text":"Cannot comment on the food as we had no service. Went in sat down watched the waitresses chat with each other for 15 minutes. Did not acknowledge us at all but once we got up and left they were quick to pick up the menus left on the table. Less than one stat for service. So disappointed as I heard great things about the falafel."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food at this place.  Service was amazing, they checked on us multiple times without seeming to interrupt our conversation too many times.  A fair warning the portions are huge. There are quite a few options on the menu for vegetarians, a few for vegans. I ordered the vegetable combo plate, fried eggplant and Lentil soup.  The best part is they give you tons and tons of pickled turnips!! I love pickled turnips, I think no falafel is complete without a pink pickled turnip inside to tantalize your tastebuds and warm your insides to satisfy your desire for the perfect falafel. (yes I take my food seriously!). With the vegetable combo plate besides everything that is stated on the menu they do also give you pita bread so you can make a sandwich for yourself if you like.  Lentil soup wasn't spectacular, but it was filling, nice and warm and seemed homemade. The fried eggplant was awesome, not sure what they put on it after they fried it but it was awesome.  This place is my new favourite middle eastern restaurant. I will update this review if I find one better."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place more...  I ordered the Baba Ghanough, Fatouche salad, Lamb skewers and an order of \"the best Falafels in Toronto\".   While the flavours were authentic for the most part: the baba Ghanough was bland, the Falafels were dry and seemed re-heated and not fresh. The lamb flavour was so strong you could tell it had no marinade of any sort (but maybe that's what they're going for -- also the skewer portions were incredibly small, my sister couldn't help but laugh to herself when it came to the table). The highlight of the entire meal was the salad which was refreshing and helped balance the strong musky flavour of the lamb. To be fair, we had a wonderful experience non-food-wise as the service was as everyone had reported: friendly and attentive. As I've mentioned, I really wanted to like this place more.  Overall I give this place **1/2 stars. I plan to give this place another try though in a hopefully redemptive dinner of some sort. Perhaps I simply didn't order the right things. I'm open to suggestions :)"}
{"text":"Very good food. The place is not fancy but the service is terrific.  I have had the Chicken Kabob (not so great - it was very over-cooked) but I have had the chicken shwarma a few times and it is good. The sandwich portions are a good size.  But the best is their pickled turnips!! OMG - i love them.  I usually but the pickles at Arz's but the Armenian Kitchen's are much better."}
{"text":"Yummy middle eastern cuisine, with some great baba ganoush.  The pork kebabs were nice and crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.  The vegetarian combo with meat (hehe, funny name) is really good, where you get to try the dips, the tabouleh, the falafel, as well as a shawarma of your choosing (the shawarma was so-so, but hey, if you gotta have meat...).  Worth a visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here about once every 1-2 months. We tend to go on a weekday evening and I kind of love that it is never busy. My usual is the veggie combo plate and he gets the veggie combo plate with meat. The tabbouleh, spreads and pickled turnip are fresh and flavourful, and I always have enough left over for lunch next day. The falafels are a dream. Crunchy and perfectly seasoned. The meat unfortunately is dry on occasion. Service has never been bad. Our server (maybe the owner?) gave me several extra pitas to go with my leftovers when he saw me trying to save our remaining scraps (oops). Overall, great place with reasonable pricing especially if you enjoy vegetarian (the falafels!!)."}
{"text":"So good that I couldn't stop eating! Well priced too! Especially loved the babaganoush and the kubbeh. Chicken shawarma could have been more flavoured but otherwise everything else was great."}
{"text":"I love this place. We always buy extra baba. (That's baba ganoush to you vegan rookies.)  Quality food, great prices, friendly family vibe."}
{"text":"Very pleasant evening. Welcoming, cozy atmosphere. Very accommodating staff and kitchen. Food  is clean and crisp - you walk away feeling satisfied not stuffed.  Excellent value."}
{"text":"This restaurant gets 3 stars as it is for loyal customers, relatives, or first timers. The décor is outdated and there was not enough meal choices for my taste. Service was odd and a bit awkward but they were pleasant people.  The food was great, everything was cooked perfectly. It was my first time having Armenian food, it was really good but it isn't for me.   So in conclusion, this restaurant just wasn't my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Trekked out to Armenian Kitchen today to give them another chance since there has been times in the far past when it was really good.  However, I was utterly disappointed.    Again the food was not fresh and I was watching the kitchen this time and that microwave just kept on going off.    My guest ordered the chicken shwarma.  It was microwaved!!!  They didn't put any onion, lettuce, fresh tomato, or tabouli.  Just dry steamed chicken and tomato that was, again, microwaved!!   The tomato was even microwaved.  The pita bread was burnt and it was fat and short.  Shwarma are supposed to be long and fit comfortably in your hand.  And I was especially not happy because I brought my guest there for a supposed special lunch because he loves shwarma.  The food was disgusting.  And we were not happy with the waitress whom was totally NOT helpful.    I ordered the meat platter and the meat was dry and again NOT FRESH.  I am pretty sure it was microwaved as well.  NEVER GOING THERE AGAIN.   I am not spending my hard earned money on microwaved food."}
{"text":"3.5/5 food 4/5 service  Shared a combination meat platter for 2. It's $14 and comes with a selection of all the specialities of the restaurant: hummus, baba ganouj, tabouleh, 4 falafels, beef/chicken shawarma, garlic paste, 4 pitas.  It was my first time at this restaurant so we asked the waitress for her suggestions. It was a good choice as the plate is large enough to share for 2. The dips all tasted great, especially the tabouleh. It was fresh, citrousy but not too herby. The chicken and beef shawarma is a little dry, but once mixed with the dips, it tasted good. The falafels are my favourite. It's crispy and hot on the outside and fluffy on the inside.   The pitas doesn't look fresh made. It was a little dry after a couple minutes.  Also ordered the spicy chili fries and that was disappointing. The fries were soggy, dull, and the sauce and garlic paste was too salty. We didn't finish the fries."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the place. The platter was ok, I have certainly had better in Toronto. The young server seemed just so impatient, she snapped a few times at us. Not really great attitude. The ratings drew us there but it's right next to an adult video store etc which is not ideal. The beef shawarma itself was dry, not juicy at all, the salad dressing had too much citrus in it. Not to my liking. If in your plate, the beef, the rice and the salad is not good then I really don't know what to rate this place as. Had high hopes, but disappointed  The veggie platter was good I was told and the hummus was respectable, but the non-veg was a big disappointment. The extra star is really for the wonderful lady server who I believe was one of the owners. She was very warm and welcoming."}
{"text":"I have written a poor review previously, and so felt that I had to come back and re-post.    After 30+ years, I decided to give this place one more shot, and to my pleasure, it was back to its old self... great food, and decent service.    Way to go Armenian Kitchen, you almost lost me.    Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"I am rarely in this part of town and I'm glad my dining companion  recommended it. The area itself is sketchy, but if you can look past that, the food is definitely legit.  Came in for a Sunday lunch, we had: - lentil soup, really flavourful and filling - veggie platter of salad, pickled beets, falafel and pita My first time having falafel and I'm really digging it. Plus it's all vegetarian? I totally could go vegan ;) I'll pass on the pickled beets tho, not my taste. DC is in love with their white and hot sauce. - baklava, I was already full from the soup and falafel but DC insisted we each have one. It's a good portion for dessert! First bite wasn't too sweet, but the sweetness kicks in once you finish.  All this for $20... That's just insane! There was only one server but the wait wasn't long and the food was super fresh. There's quite a few mixed reviews about this place, but since I was there on a Sunday,  it was quiet. It also helps that DC is a regular here."}
{"text":"It's been over two decades since I've eaten here!! I can't believe it, but totally worth going back, especially for those pickled turnips. Yum I had the beef kebab, served with rice and lovely salad. My mom had the hummus with falafel balls and a lentil soup to start. That was the catalyst to going there this evening and there were no regrets.  In a world where nothing remains the same  anymore, it was good to see that there are some gems sparkling around the city!"}
{"text":"Armenian kitchen has by far the best baba ghanouj hands-down.  After years away, we returned and spend a Saturday afternoon eating in silence as we dipped warm pita into Lebnah and hummus.  You definitely don't come for the Decor but the food is authentic and prepared with care and all round awesome!"}
{"text":"I liked it.The cook is cooking very tasteful.all of food The same taste.I just  never like the toilet.The toilet needs to be more modern and clean.I ordered the coffee was served cold.The lentil soup was not at all related to the original."}
{"text":"Great place. Very mom and pop feeling including the delicious authentic food. Great hummus and chicken kabob. I'll be back to try more on the menu. Nice service."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food.  3 stars for the location (and 2 stars for parking).  Another 3 stars for service.  I met up with friends here who highly recommended this little eatery at Victoria Park and Eglinton.  The first problem is that this restaurant is located in a little old strip mall with very little parking.  After making a hazardous left turn into the lot, I watched as a couple road ragers fought over parking spaces.  As luck would have it, a space opened up in front of me, so I parked only to have another car roar over and its driver scream at me.   Nice preamble to lunch?  When I sat down, I was ignored by the owner/server for the first 15 minutes.  I was starving, and wanted to order appetizers and a drink, but he seemed content looking after one side of the restaurant only.  But when my friends showed up, the owner welcomed them with open arms.  He seemed very surprised when they sat with me.  You could tell that the owner was thinking, \"Oh damn, I shouldn't have ignored their friend!\"  I ordered a lamb sandwich which was tasty, we shared a variety of Armenian appetizers.  Overall, the parking situation is enough to scare me away from a repeat visit, but maybe if we figured out an offhour, I'd come back.  It's a shame because this restaurant has been around for years."}
{"text":"Basically, a good place to get some tasty middle-eastern food in a setting that's not quite as \"fast-food\" as most of the middle-eastern places in Toronto.  This is a sit-down restaurant with dated decor.  It feels like a late-70s diner, with none of the retro charm that might inspire.  It's not dirty or an eyesore, it's just very dated.  The service is cheerful, if perhaps a little slow at times.   I've never had authentic Armenian food, but some of the other reviewers point out that this place isn't really Armenian.  I'm going to lump it into 'middle-eastern food'.  What you should expect is things like: felafels, shwarma, baba gannoush, pickled turnips.    All the dishes I've had there is above-average, at least for the Toronto area.  I've enjoyed each visit and I'll undobutedly come again, at least when I'm in the area.  Although there are some rough spots that could use attention, I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars  I'm not too sure what distinguishes Armenian food from other Middle Eastern food based on my visit, since the combo platter had a lot of familiar items: hummus, baba ganoush, tabouleh, flat bread, beef and chicken, falafel, etc... However, I fully enjoyed my meal and would come back anytime.  The combo platter is $14 and came with all those items. The falafel was fantastic and the highlight. The meat was really good quality, but could've been better had it been served a bit warmer. All the other items hit the spot. I like that they leave hot sauce and tahini at the table, so you can freely add to your heart's content.  It's not fancy inside, so you wouldn't come here on a date but it's perfectly fine for dinning in.  I'm coming back for sure."}
{"text":"The value for money is excellent!  Food is very tasty and the portion sizes are generous.  Our server was very friendly and polite.  Everyone else in the restaurant seemed to be a regular.  Would recommend this place without a doubt."}
{"text":"There is nothing Armenian about this restaurant unless you consider Arabic food to be Armenian. Service was not good as the waitress decided that her shift had ended and made us pay for the food before we even got a chance to eat it. As for the Arabic ( yes Arabic) food they served us, nothing special about it. Shawarma plate was tasteless, falafel was eh, barbecue was terrible. Will never be going back here again."}
{"text":"When I lived in scarborough my family and I would go here at least once every couple of months. I wish there was someplace downtown that offered the same quality food for the value offered here. I miss it!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. I Always order the fried eggplant and hummus! Always leave with a takeout order of hummus! Yum!"}
{"text":"I've been going to the Armenian Kitchen with my dad for as long as I can remember. It's gone through some ownership changes and minor renovations, but eating at the AK has never disappointed me.  The Felafel are perfect, and the hummus is the best I've had in Toronto. Other notable dishes are the Fatouche (tomato, cucumber, mint, sour sumach, and toasted pita), ful bean dish, and of course the tabbouleh.  Oh, and the Lentil Soup starter is unbelievable.  I don't know anywhere in Toronto where you can eat like a king for 6-8 people, enjoy your meal so heartily, and still come out with a bill around 60-80 dollars.  Must-go."}
{"text":"This place is located conveniently near my workplace, so I've come here for lunch a few times and loved it! The outside may not seem impressive, but as soon as you walk in, it's a whole different world. I highly recommend the lamb or chicken - they are both cooked to perfection, super juicy and tender. The baked tomatoes are amazing as well (I don't even like tomatoes that much!) and the fried eggplant appetizer was also very tasty. Even something as simple as the rice was full of flavour. Don't be fooled by the exterior and the neighbouring shops in the plaza, this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Small place with humble and friendly people. If you are coming here for Armenian food, then this is not your place. The owner is Syrian, of the original Armenian owner what is left is the name and few decor item. Their  food is of the middle east family. If you are looking for elegance, ambiance or other intangibles, keep looking. If you have been in enough places to know that the substance is more important than what something appears, then give it a try.  Definitely the vegetarian combo with meat (!?!) is very good. The felafel / tabbouleh / hummus and Baba Ghanouge are great. You should order more felafel whatever you are going to have because they are really, really good.  The Baklava was outstanding.  Thank you Toronto!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years and LOVE Armenian Kitchen. Food is always fantastic !!   The fried eggplant, Kebbeh and Baba Ghanouge is the best I've ever had in Toronto.  The restaurant decor hasn't changed in years, but the staff are great and always have a wonderful time !!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Armenian Kitchen my whole life. Since I was a small boy. The food is delicious and healthy. Came while it was busy. Be patient. The food is always worth the wait. My wife had her standard of Hummus with fried beef and pine nuts. I had Foule and we shared a side of rice and 2 kubbeh. 2 iced teas. And Bob's your uncle. Fantastic. I love these people."}
{"text":"- we had the fried eggplant and lamb which were good, but also the chicken schwarma which was rly dry and the flavors of the salad were meh - poor service, pricey - we saw the cook take pita off a pile of a customer's leftover bread basket who had left, and put it in the pile to give to new customers :S"}
{"text":"Close but no cigar...   After reading some positive reviews on yelp, and being of Middle Eastern descent I knew I had to go check this place out. Armenian kitchen is located in a small strip plaza off Victoria Park. This is a modest restaurant; the décor is old school and probably hasn't changed since this place opened. Fortunately for me I am not here for the décor!   My friend and I were seated rather quickly and the place was quite full on a Saturday night. The menu is pretty standard; kabobs, shawarma, falafel, hummus etc. For appetizers my friend and I ordered a plate of hummus and some falafels. The falafels were the best part of the meal, they were large in size, so crunchy on the outside but nice and fluffy on the inside, they were seasoned well (went great with some tahini sauce and the complimentary pickled turnips). The hummus was pretty good, it was quite creamy and went well with their house made hot sauce; however I felt like a little more garlic would have elevated this dish.   For main I ordered a chicken kebob with tabule instead of rice, my friend had the chicken shawarma plate with rice. My main came with a single skewer of chicken, the chunks were on the smaller side. The kebob was all white meat, had a nice grilled flavour and was quite juicy. The side of tabule was ok, the parsley was not chopped as finely as it should have been and it needed more lemon juice, overall the tabule was just ok. My friend's shawarma came with large pieces of white meat chicken, the chicken was slightly dry and not crispy on the outside (as shawarma should be), but it did have a pretty good flavour. The side of rice pilaf with the shawarma was quite good, very buttery and cooked well. All in all our mains were satisfactory.   They do have a small dessert menu but my friend and I were too full. They also have a full bar and they do have arak (a traditional Middle Eastern liquor), I had a glass of that and it was a nice accompaniment to my meal. The service was ok; the waiter was friendly but a little slow at times.   Overall Armenian kitchen has the right idea, makes adequate food but could be so much better with a few tweaks. It was good enough to warrant a second visit and is a good alternative to all the shawarma places in the area when one is craving some Middle Eastern cuisine. I shall return."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Do not be deceived by the exterior. When I first saw this place, I didn't think much of it, but I was pleasantly surprised. They started us with pink pickled turnips which I thought opened up our palettes.   Their lamb kebab was sooo tender and juicy! It was cooked and flavoured perfectly, which is rare, especially at the price we paid. The rice and and salad that came with it were excellent as well. One of the best lamb I've had.  The vegetarian combo with chicken shawarma was such a delight to dig into. I couldn't believe the portion size considering the price. The falafels were crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, loved the creamy hummus with soft warm pita and the tabbouleh was really good (just a little too strong on the lemon juice/vinegar?). The only reason I deducted a star was because the chicken shawarma was too dry (I smothered it in my hummus, haha).  The baklava was good as well. I also ordered a mhalabia for the first time - a custard topped with pistachio and syrup. It's an acquired taste... Not sure how I feel about it yet...  Overall, I'd highly recommend their shish kebab platters and vegetarian combo platter. Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"My family has been going to Armenian Kitchen for probably 15 years -- since I was a kid and before I even lived in the city, but whenever we visited relatives down here, we'd often meet at A.K.  Service:  We've never once felt unwelcome. The service has been fantastic every time. The various wait staff is always courteous, always professional, and always casual enough where we feel comfortable. Customer service can make or break an experience, and here it's great.  Appetizers:  The falafel is delicious. It's well prepared and never overdone. Their kubbeh is also great -- its basically a minced meat ball with various spices, in a bulgur shell. They also have plates of hummus and baba ghannouj that are flavourful and pair well with fresh pita. We recently tried their more Canadian appetizers like their \"spicy garlic fries\" and were only mildly impressed -- it's basically fries with garlic paste, tossed in Frank's Hot Sauce. The sauce and paste just makes the fries soggy, and the flavour is just like covering fries in Frank's..... stick with the middle eastern appetizers!  Main courses:  Wraps.... If you have a smaller appetite, their wraps are great. My mom usually gets just a wrap as she's a small eater. The chicken and beef shawarma wraps are both good on their own, although most of the time, anyone who gets a wrap goes \"mixed\" which is both meats -- but PLEASE remember to specify what you don't want in it, or else it will have everything, including tahina, hot sauce, onions, etc -- and they generally don't ask you. They just assume you want it all, unless you say.  I recently tried the sujok wrap (having had sujok at several other places) and was quite impressed. Not just is it a lot cheaper than the other wraps, but I found it equally satisfying both in terms of taste and quantity. Sujok is a middle eastern spicy sausage (sometimes part of breakfast) that is very salty. It's also plenty delicious.  Dinners... If you have a larger appetite, their full dinners are DELICIOUS. Everyone else in my family usually gets a dinner, and it's enough to fill a very hungry person, or as 2 meals for most people. Again we always get \"mixed\" shawarma dinners which will come with plenty of beef and chicken, which is tender and spiced just right. The salad is tasty, the rice is great, and the portion is plenty filling. The large amount of garlic paste and hummus on your plate is also worth noting! YUM!!  SAUCE! Now for the best part: remember to ask for bottles of tahina (pronounced tahini in north america), and also hot sauce if you like that. It's not the traditional \"thick\" tahina you may get some places (it's more of a watered-down liquid, in a squeeze bottle) but it's still very tasty and in unlimited supply -- a group of 6 of us go through SEVERAL bottles of it when we're there, putting it on everything -- the appetizers, the meat, the rice, everything. We often ask for extra bottles so that no one has to wait. It enhances the taste tremendously, and enhances our entire experience.  They will give you tons of fresh pita with every course -- just keep asking for more if you run out. Not just do you get the experience of a plate of food, but you can have fun with it. Put some meat in your pita, throw some garlic/hummus in there, some rice if you want, then cover it all in sauce: make your OWN wraps!  From our experience, there's always plenty of seating unless it's a holiday of some sort. In those cases (or if you're a large party), make a reservation. Otherwise, we've just walked in.  Overall, we love this place and will continue to go back. The price is decent I guess -- $12.99 per dinner and about $5 for each appetizer. With drinks / tax / tip, expect it to be about $20 per person.  Whether you eat there or take it to go, you'll be satisfied. We just prefer to eat in because of the unlimited tahina!"}
{"text":"Came on BlogTO's recommendation. This restaurant is #5 on the list of best hummus places in Toronto. Hummus was passable, but nothing outstanding. Not particularly smooth. Not particularly delicious. Went for lunch and there were next to no people inside. Had the lamb shish kebab sandwich. Hot sandwich, but that's about it. Lamb didn't taste much like lamb at all. Also served like a takeout sandwich on a ceramic plate. Had some spicy fries that tasted like a bunch of tabasco had been poured onto fries. Fries were also kinda soggy."}
{"text":"I found myself returning to this place and my 2nd and 3rd visits were a lot better the initial round.  It's definitely now one of my go-to places for good middle eastern food.  Highly recommended to get the veggie plate with meat combo and a side order of fries.  It's plenty of food and the service is better later in the evening with less patrons.  It's not spectacular but very solid tasting food."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant since before i was born. Thats right, when my mom was pregnant with me she was coming to this place. My family is close friends with the owner and i know this place inside and out. You will not find any other restaurant that uses fresher food or is as clean as this one. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"After reading a lot of good reviews,I was there to have some middle eastern food. I knew that it was not fully armenian cuisine but I still wanted to have a good shwarma.  Let me start with the good. The non-meat items are superb. The falafel is so far the best I have tasted in Toronto. The salad was nicely dressed and had good flavours. The pita they served were store bought. The service was nice.   The bad however was the shwarma. I was really dissapointed with the quality. The price I paid was 12.99 for the plate and trust me even the shawrma plates at food courts in a mall are better tasting than theirs. And they cost less than 10 bucks!  The downside was caused by an underseasoned rice side and the lack of flavours in the beef it self. The shwarma pieces were dry and soggy. I wanted them to be crispy on the outer side and juicy in the inside.   I would way this place does not deserve a four star if you are looking for a flavourful meat item.   I checked whether they were on Zagat or not and they are not. The restaurant says they are."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicous - tastes like my grandma's cooking! Love the lamb kebob, shawarma & chicken combo platters. Appetizers are really good and they have a great combination of platters & choices.. If you've grown up with this food, then you'll feel like you're eating at home. The fries are AMAZING and always fresh! One of the best places to go to for shawarma & kebob. The service is ok, slow at times, but pretty consistent. Decor is a bit outdated, but it's clean. The food makes up for it!  Must tries:  Babaganoush Hummus Lamb Kebob Shawarma Falafel the BEST fries!  It's always busy with customers either dining in or getting take out. They also offer catering."}
{"text":"Not all that offering in authentic Armenian food. It's more of a Middle-Eastern restaurant. We felt misled by its name. The dishes we ordered were just mediocre."}
{"text":"This isn't really a bad place. It's actually got some very good food. I got the vegetarian combo with chicken shawarma. This came with three falafel's, hummus, baba ghannouj, tabuleh salad and some very nice pieces of chicken shawarma. It also came with 3 pieces of pita bread. The salad, hummus, falafel's and chicken shawarma were very good. I just didn't really like the baba ghannouj which dropped it a star. And I like to think that I know my baba ghannouj. Other than that, I really have to rave about the chicken shawarma because it was pretty fresh and seasoned very well.  The wait staff is really friendly but never refilled my water. Also, the decor is really old and traditional. The tables and chairs are really old and the bathroom isn't very clean."}
{"text":"Armenian kitchen is a Scarborough staple. In business for 20+ years, the kitchen is a mainstay for Toronto police, Armenians, and locals. Be aware that service can be slow at times. Most popular dishes include shawarma, kebab, falafel, and various middle eastern dips. Food is home-made with love. Prices are very fair. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It is hit or miss. In my last time here, the food was not fresh at all. The meat was old and had an expired taste to it."}
{"text":"The food is fresh, tasteful and very well prepared. The price is fair and the quantity is generous. In 3 weeks I've been here 3 times! I'm becoming a huge fan. It is a family business and they are very friendly, the kitchen is open so you can see it is clean. The only reason I don't give a 5 star it is because they are a bit disorganized remembering your order and the carpet also has seen better days :)"}
{"text":"Below my expectation food wise! Tried shawerma chicken, chicken tekka, yogurt salad all 1/5, and soujok 3/5. I guess to save the name of lebanese and armenian words, they have to change the chef! Will never visit  it! P.S: the runner/supervisor Dalal was smiley face, wish her all the best, but work on the taste and on the presentation of your menu!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, it's a different taste of Middle Eastern, not the greatest but not the worst either."}
{"text":"I've been going to Armenian Kitchen since the mid-90s and the food is consistently delicious, fresh and well-priced.  I usually order the vegetable plate with meat - the shawarma is always on point and never fatty or gristly; falafels are fresh and tasty and the hummos and baba ghanough are the best I've ever had.  The only negative thing I have to say is that, about five years ago, one of the waitresses was really obnoxious.  She made a comment to my new boyfriend (now husband) about how much wine I was drinking ... we've since opted to now order carryout."}
{"text":"Delicious food and reasonable prices! Would definitely come back here, don't be fooled by the exterior as this restaurant is a bit hidden."}
{"text":"I decided to try something different and opted for this small quiet diner. Although a veggie lover, I opted for the chicken kabob which came with a side option of either salad ( nothing extravagant, plain old garden variant) or fries. The chicken was mouth-watering and of decent quality. However, the non-alcoholic beverage variety was scant and non-existent."}
{"text":"Plastic table cloths, homey feeling - it's like a dinner from the 80's. It's cheap and cheerful food in my opinion. Not amazing but pretty good."}
{"text":"Still my favourite Middle Eastern spot in the city. A couple updates though.  First, after repeat visits, I realize this is really a four star place. I just feel they're cutting corners a little bit. For example, the Vegetable Combo Plate ($12) only has 3 tiny falafel balls. The dips - hummus, baba ganoush, and labneh - are phenomenal though, as is the fatouche salad ($4.50 Regular, $8 Large). Don't be fooled by the foul ($5) though, it ain't so good.  Second, an update on the story behind Armenian Kitchen. It was originally opened by an Armenian guy, hence the name. However, it was later sold to a Lebanese guy, who now runs it. I've heard the quality of Armenian Kitchen has gone down a little in recent years and I wonder if it corresponds to this change in ownership. The waitresses I've talked to are Iraqi and Egyptian. So, there's essentially no Armenian connexion anymore. I don't care though, it's still damn good."}
{"text":"The chicken Shawarma is unreal. Everything is fantastic and well priced. Go eat here now!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to the Armenian Kitchen for the past 15 years. It truly is a Scarboro icon, and if you like middle eastern food, the food at this place will satisfy your urges.   The decor hasn't really changed in the past 15 years, it could use a bit of updating, however the food is what brings you here.  My favorite dishes at this place are the kebab dishes. All the meats, lamb, beef, chicken are very flavourful and tender.The rice and salad are very good as well.  This place can get very busy on Friday and Saturday nights, and service is not the best at times, but all that aside. This place is a keeper and a must try."}
{"text":"Great homecook middle Eastern eatery, family run business. Reasonable pricing & generous portions. Hot fresh food. No belly dancers. Hahaha.. Average location, but lots of parking."}
{"text":"Fantastic Mediterranean food here. The best falafel I've tasted -- very crunchy, crispy exterior, and soft inside, and very hot (freshly deep fried). Got the Vegetable Combo Platter with Meat (with hummus, baba ghanoush, falafel, tabouli, and shawarma) - also served optionally without meat btw.    They also make their pickled turnip (you know, the bright pink ones) in-house, and they have more flavour than any I've ever had in my life.   Note: the decor is \"homey\", not \"fancy\": plastic covers over table cloths and vinyl covered metal frame chairs. But warm atmosphere, super friendly and attentive service, and delicious eats made the experience great.   I am frankly quite surprised at the several low star reviews present, as the criticisms they mention (falafels freshness, baba ghanoush flavour) as lacking was not at all my experience - to the contrary in fact.   I highly recommend, if this kind of food and homey atmosphere is your thing."}
{"text":"I love this place.  BEST HUMMUS EVER!!!! Yeah I meant to shout it! Great lentil soup.  Over the years I've had most things but my fave is the veggie combo with either chicken or beef.  Awesome.  Would give it five stars but this place is badly in need of a makeover.  Dumpy little plaza but don't be shy, you have to try the hummus!!!"}
{"text":"First things first: Armenian Kitchen is not Armenian food. The owner has Palestinian roots and serves fairly traditional food from that region. That's cool and all, but as my dad and I are frequent visitors to the Levant, you can imagine how disappointed we were that we weren't eating traditional Armenian food. The only notable difference on the menu was that there was a single pork item.  This wouldn't have been so awful except that my dad, who was visiting from out of town, chose to venture to Scarborough (I live by UofT campus) to eat at this single restaurant in a strip mall that housed an adult video store. We were baffled to see that menu looked Lebanese and the waitress was Croatian.  That said, the food is great! And since we like Levantine food, we can appreciate a good meal of hummus, ful, falafel, and eggplant. I'm fairly snobby about eating falafel outside of the Middle East but this place knows what it's doing. Wow. The pita was typical store bought stuff, no big deal, and my Arabic coffee was eh, but those are small potatoes.  This is not the place for authentic Armenian food, but if you are in Victoria Park for whatever reason, you'll definitely get a satisfying meal here.  P.S. It's not too far from the Scarborough Bluffs, so take advantage of your location and spend some time at the park!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the variety of food at this place. I have been here over 5 times and would recommend it to all. Please don't be phased by the pics. Once you try their food, you will be a regular."}
{"text":"I come from Europe and I've had Lebanese food from real Lebanese restaurants many times.  I have tried different place around Toronto and this place is the best so far.  Service is welcoming Food extremely yummy. Ambience could be better  Anyway if you come here get the lamb and the chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"Best food for value! Waiter not perfect but better than average. Clean bathroom. Know this place for years food always the same, fresh and tasty. Highly recommended!"}
