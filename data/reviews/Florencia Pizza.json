{"text":"The worst customer service I've experienced in a long time.  The manager is anything less than helpful and does not care at all about their customers."}
{"text":"Just picked up a large deep dish pepperoni, the toppings  (cheese & pepperoni ) were sufficient amount. The crust was baked just right, but the sauce really had no flavor, to me it seemed like a water down tomato sauce. Other than that the pizza was good"}
{"text":"Very solid pepperoni thin crust pizza! Not a ton of good food places around, so you can be sure to have a good pie here."}
{"text":"Eating my lefties as I write this.   Is the best ever pizza I have ever eaten?  No, but compared to all the other choices near my neighborhood, it's pretty darn good. Homemade dough, good sauce, fresh mushrooms (canned is a big no-no in my book), and a pretty good antipasta salad too.  In the middle of Sun City West?  Who would have thunk it? And I would have never found it without YELP....  :)"}
{"text":"Years ago when we moved to Sun City West we went to Florencia and had a pretty good pizza; went there several times just because it was close. We stopped when the quality changed. In the past couple years we decided to revisit Florencia and we are very glad we did. Always friendly, prompt, reasonable prices for really great food. We especially like the deep dish pizza and I love the chicken Caesar salad. The subs are great. We have not found a bad thing on the menu. Thanks for revamping our local pizza joint!"}
{"text":"Best in town by far, too bad I dont live close by anymore. Delicious thin crust pizza, priced very reasonable. Overloaded with toppings, which is the hallmark of Chicago pizza. My biggest pet peeve with most pizza joints is that they are stingy with the toppings, even when you pay for double toppings. Not Florencias. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for lunch on Thursday.  We started with the antipasto salad which was delicious with three kinds of olives, pepperoni and salami, pickeled peppers and many other goodies.  The whole things was very fresh.  We had a large special pizza hand tossed which was also very good.  The crust was just right and had a very good flavor.  Needless to say we took home over half of it and enjoyed it over the next two days.  This is a very good local pizza place.
Next time we want to try the deep dish pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza I could find. Great service, great food, and comfortable uniquely decorated restaurant. This is as close as it gets to Chicago pizza. Don't forget to try the Caesar salad."}
{"text":"I love this pizza place, my office orders pizza from here once or twice a month, their Margarita pizza is what I like the most! I can't rave about how good these guys are!"}
{"text":"Its been ten years since we've been back to Florencia Pizza and I must say, not only have the prices gone up tremendously, but the quality of pizza has gone way down. I ordered a five topping 16\" pizza for $25 and it was like eating card board, sauce out of can, mushrooms out of a can,  sausage finely ground up, (thought it was hamburger), thinly sliced pieces of green pepper and tiny pieces of chopped onion. The only reason why it received two stars was the garlic. The wings were full of fat and precooked with sauce. Will not return."}
{"text":"Well for a long time I only had there pizza and I enjoy them every time. I had some friends show up and they wanted to go out to lunch. I suggested we go to Florencia Pizza because of there pizzas. Once I was there, I decided to try something else. I had there Meatball Sandwich. It was a great sandwich. Now I am waiting for some more friends to show up so I can go there again. I really don't like eating alone at a restaurant..."}
{"text":"In an area of many pizza places, Florencia stands out.  We love their deep dish pizza crust, almost as good as our favorite Chicago pizza, Lou Malnotti's.
Service is efficient, restaurant is always full at this time of the year."}
{"text":"Florencia is always a pleasant experience. Note that they really close at 8pm...and you are asked to leave. Also no restroom. Pizza and service are consistent and good with fair prices.  The dinning room is small and unsophisticated but not cozy and always full (customers seem happy here).  I also like that they have real plates and utensils (no paper and plastic)."}
{"text":"I wish I read the review from Sascha R. before I came here.  We walked in at 7:20 (40 minutes before their \"closing time\") and they refused to do anything but a takeout order.  Yes, really.  A bad sign but I really wanted a chicago-style deep dish so I ordered a pie to go.  They charged my card immediately.  It's a 25-minute wait for the pie and at some point my girlfriend needs to use the bathroom.  They refused to let her use it.  No explanation.  No apologies.  Just four employees and us in a tiny little hole-in-the-wall restaurant and a tense stand-off over usage of the facilities.  Honestly, it seemed like most of them felt guilty about it as they did the look-sheepishly-to-other-person-with-more-rank-than-me-cuz-im-ashamed-to-tell-you-that-you-cant-use-our-bathroom move.  The chain ended with an older woman who I'm guessing is the same older woman mentioned in other reviews.  I will give her credit, though -- she's really good at the looking at you with disdain thing.  So much so that I lost my appetite and cancelled my order.  Alas, I still have to deal with following up with the credit card company to make sure the charge is backed out.

All was not lost, though, and this story has a happy ending.  We ended up going to Little Sicily about five minutes away and had this: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/little-sicily-sun-city?select=DIGu6OnfptU2GJRIYqGrwA"}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a week.  I'm sad about the two reviews about coming in at night.  My family has worked in the sun cities for the last 50 years.  My parents, my husband and me and now our adult children.  Everyone knows that restaurants in the sun cities close early.  We are tired and old.  Come early and enjoy the delicious food.  The pizza is great.  I like the Italian sausage sandwich w/o cheese and my hubby loves the hot Italian sub.  Everyone we take there loves it.  So go early and remember you are eating in a retirement community."}
{"text":"I forgot what real pizza tastes like thanks for reminding me!  Excellent!  Also. Quick. When the server is so friendly and attentive sometimes that it feels flirtatious, that is good customer service. Thank you for making me feel like you actually wanted my business. I'll be back!  

I called in for my pizza and even that experience was good!  

Thanks from your new regular!"}
{"text":"Wow! We heard about Florencia pizza and decided to check it. 

We ordered a large two item pizza and took it home. The pizza was awesome! The crust Was of the right consistency not doughy not too thick not too thin. I haven't had the deep dish but that's going to be my next order."}
{"text":"wow, i cannot believe what i herard at this pizzeria . the owner told people it was 8:03 and we close at 8pm and i have a family to go home to.  the worst part was the senior citizen, in a wheel chair could not get a pop refill, because they turned the self serve pop machine off. he came in at 7:35. what a rude place, in the  lovely city of sun city west, az.  oh, the salad was good, but the pizza was sad., burnt and short on the toppings."}
{"text":"Good pizza at a reasonable price that's NOT a chain! What more can you ask for? Service is good and the pizza is great. The only downfall is that you have to deal with the Sun City-ers which makes visiting the restaurant annoying. Beyond that, the restaurant itself is clean and simply set up and the food is very good."}
{"text":"Who would guess an outstanding pizza place would be found within \"the walls\" of sun city west?  Don't be fooled by its ordinary looks... The owners are friendly, the dough is outstanding, great crust. And the sauce is fresh tasting not the usual placid tomato paste found in most other pizza joints. The owner and I had a nice discussion about deep dish dough..."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and the Greek salad was giant!"}
{"text":"Went here based on Yelp. The deep dish pizza was really crispy and delicious. The greek salad was pretty good also. However, the ambiance and service were odd. The lighting is bright enough to violate interrogation guidelines in most 3rd world countries. Also, it is critically important to note the time you are eating; they close at 8pm. This means that if you get there at 7:15 and are still eating at 8, the staff will be turning chairs upside down, sweeping, and grabbing any dish that you are not holding onto. I definitely recommend the pizza but dinning near closing time is not a great experience."}
{"text":"Unlike others, our experience with the staff was great. They we extremely nice and friendly and we got our food very fast. The place was packed too, every table was taken. 

Unfortunately the food is a different story. I had high hopes based on reviews but it was just... bad. We ordered an anti pasta salad, which was good. The wings and pizza looked great but they were flavorless and the pizza was so greasy."}
{"text":"I never give places 5 stars, but this place is worth it!!  I always get a slice of cheese pizza.  It is the cheesiest more delicious pizza I've had. I love this place, I just wish there hours were longer and that they were open on Sundays."}
{"text":"My favorite West Valley pizza joint is in a strip mall in Sun City West!  Their regular crust is very good! Their deep dish is even better.  They have great slice deals during lunch hour too!  Wings could use some help though."}
{"text":"Pizza was enjoyable but nothing special.  I think people come here for the low cost over quality."}
{"text":"Excellent, but eat it in....

Excellent, excellent deep dish meat combo  pizza-crust yummy, but as a take out the bottom gets all soggy and we only live 8 minutes away, the bottom of the cardboard box was pretty moist by the time I put the left overs in the frig.....Garden salad very fresh and super portion.....will return for sure!!!"}
{"text":"I have had better pizza but the consistent quality of this pizza ranks pretty high. i usually order
takeout and the order taker says \"Ready in 15 minutes\". They have never kept me waiting regardless how full the restaurant is at the time. Yes, I am a \"senior\" but that doesn't affect my taste buds."}
{"text":"This is a great pizzaria. Service is as prompt as the line allows. It's obvious that.the place is full of long-standing customers. We will return because the pizza was generous and delicious. This was our first visit but it won't be our last."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood eatery.  All my guest and family when then come to visit insist on eating here at least once during their stay.  Best food ever, owner is friendly and comes to greet people when he is not in the back preparing the delightful scrumptious items on the menu.  So glad we have this bistro in our community"}
{"text":"I love Florencia's. I used to go pretty often, but was reintroduced when I started a job down the street. I have a whole new appreciation for it now that I know about their great lunch specials. Their lunch slices are actually two slices from a medium pizza, so getting just one slice is REALLY filling!"}
{"text":"Small pizza place serving pizza true Italian style. Got half meat lovers style and half Hawaiian. Both were great and one of the best spots for pizza around. Definitely going back next time I'm in AZ in the mood for pizza."}
{"text":"Moving here from Chicago I didn't have high hopes for pizza. There were actually several strike outs before I stumbled upon this little gem. The pizza is as close to Chicago style as I have found. Thin crust or deep dish. Good toppings. Not those nasty turd ball sausage pieces. The salads are amazing too. I highly recommend. This is my go to pizza place."}
{"text":"The reviews looked good so we figured we would try it. Being from New Jersey GOOD PIZZA is hard to find. And this place does not qualify in the least. We walked in and it was all.. should I say.. 'seniors', hence the good reviews. The pizza was flavorless and greasy. I hate Domino's but even their pizza is better. Got the barbeque wings. The were burned on the outside but squishy on the inside. I couldn't even box it home to take home as leftover's.
Find another pizza place. This place doesn't even have a restroom. 

UPDATE: Milk of Magnesia has nothing on this place. It'll flush ya out and I have an iron stomach."}
{"text":"I have turned my nose up to all deep dish pies offered to me in the past. I can only make the assumption that at some point in my solid food eating life, I ate the wrong deep dish! This is by far thee best pizza I have ever eaten! Next stop Italy! Only fair to assume that pizza is better there. 
The dough is key, and they served me the most perfectly baked, melt in your mouth, flaky crust! Next the sauce, it actually tastes like fresh tomatoes were just crushed that morning and I'm hoping they were......... Amazing! I also had a salad with homemade Italian dressing served with a slice of freshly baked bread. Dressing was also excellent. Soups (homemade of course) are also available. They were serving Italian wedding soup, my favorite, but I passed and went for the salad. As we were finishing up I overheard a women telling her friends that she comes in to the pizzria just to have the soup! That's it, I'm coming back next week! 

I will be bringing everyone I know to this little piece of Sicily hiding in Sun City West, Az."}
{"text":"Stopped in as I always do when I'm in town visiting mom and had great pizza as usual. Friendly staff and a nice clean adult quiet place to sit back and enjoy great pizza. See you in May!!"}
{"text":"Best Meat Ball Sandwiches in the area. We are from CA and when ever we come to town we make a point to stop and have pizza or the meat ball sandwich. The sandwich is large enough for two of us to share and be full. Very nice place to eat!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love Florencia Pizza, especially the plump, tasty wings which are BAKED instead of fried. We've ordered a little bit of everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. The sandwiches are delicious, salads fresh, and pizza toppings are outstanding.  You won't be disappointed. The only downside is that you have to order at the counter, because they do not have   waitress service.  Given the great food, I can give up the waitress."}
{"text":"Really good thin crust pizza I know where I'll be going whenever I'm in the area. And the pepperoni was pest edges were just a little crispy just how I like it."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in the north west valley. The service was great and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Always love the lunch combo from Florencia! Yummy pizza and the bread that comes with the salads are amazing! Also love the chicken Caesar salad! Friendly employees also!"}
{"text":"I travel a lot and am always looking for good pizza and this is really good pizza!  Love the meatball!"}
{"text":"I have never dealt with such poor customer service and rudeness in all my life. We came in as a large party, ordered a lot of pizza, spent a lot of money, and at 8pm on the dot the mean lady at the front started passive aggressively YELLING \"Everyone get out! We are closed! I want to see my family!\" The pizza place is listed that it is open until 8pm. Which means the kitchen closes at 8pm. And then people eat and chat like a normal situation. And leave. But at 8pm she decided she was closed and kicked all her customers out! I said \"you are being rude.\" \"She said I want to go home. We close at 8.\" I said \"then you should list closing time as 7pm. Give customers a chance to finish their meal and enjoy their mealtime. She then yelled to everyone again \"get out!\" Another customer said to her \"if you want to go home so much, quit.\" She said \"I will with customers as horrible as you!\" 

It was beyond rude. This woman's vitriol towards everyone in the place was palpable. She should never be working in customer service again. She even rushed out a man in a wheel chair!

Not to mention the pizzas was totally mediocre. 

Never go to this place!"}
{"text":"Consistantly good food.  The pizza is the best!  Salads are large.  Small, quaint, busy place. They are packed every Friday night.  Get there before 6pm or you won't get a seat.  When the snowbirds are in town there will be a wait.  They also offer take out."}
