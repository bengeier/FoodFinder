{"text":"Located in a small plaza in North York, New Greatime Corp is a Chinese restaurant that serves  Szechuan Cuisine. In case you're wondering, Szechuan Cuisine is known for their super spicy and tongue numbing dishes and that is exactly what we're here for!   For appetizer, we ordered a cold dish which is shredded potato in hot and sour sauce. This is one of my favourite Szechuan dishes! It is indeed very appetising. Although this wasn't as spicy as I expected it to be but it was refreshing.  A main dish we ordered was the famous boiled fish fillet in chilli oil (or better known as water cooked fish). You can feel the spiciness by just looking at this picture! Some might find this dish too oily but this is a traditional Szechuan dish that you must try! The fillet had a very soft and smooth texture which I liked and it was marinated to the right level of saltiness. Underneath the fish is a layer of nappa cabbage which i think is the most spicy part of the dish as it absorbed all the chilli oil but it's oh so yummy!  Remember to eat this with a bowl of rice and a can of ice cold coke. You won't regret it.   We decided to order a non spicy dish just to be safe and we got the Surimi and egg with Broccoli. This is another famous Chinese dish that you must try in your life time. This dish in Chinese literally means 'Comparable to crab meat' although crab is not an ingredient in it. Traditionally Egg white and fish meat is used to create a texture and fresh seafood taste that resembled fresh crab meat but over time, different adaptations came in and ingredients such as surimi ( imitation crab meat) and broccoli were introduced. The raw egg yolk is added last and diners would mix it in with the egg white along with red vinegar. The egg yolk gives it a smooth texture while the vinegar brings out the fresh taste of the imitation crab meat.  The restaurant's name in Chinese means the Coming together of Spiciness and Aroma which very much reflect the dishes they serve but its English name made me a little confused. Nonetheless this is a legit Szechuan restaurants in the neighbourhood with quality Chinese food which I enjoyed. I would return again to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Drove by along this stretch of neighbourhood that has nothing whatsoever, so when I saw a plaza with some signs of LIFE I took a U-turn and drove towards the light.  I didn't know what to expect from afar but the closer I got the more I saw the Chinese Lettering.  Just my LUCK to find a discovery and it happens to be spicy Szechuan rather than Cake/Pie.  The Lettering wasn't completely indicative of it being Szechuan but the English Business Name was worst, NEW GREATIME CORP.  I wonder if they took a prior Massage Parlour's Business Name for their own.  Walking inside is the first sign that it is definitely Szechuan Chinese while the Menu had a Logo of a Dragon with \"HOT\" written in the middle.  Szechaun Dan Dan Noodle($5.99) had barely any Minced Pork but was completely covered in Spicy Sauce known in typical Szechuan Dan Dan.  The Noodles are Grocery variety nothing to note.  Spicy like eating Spicy Chili Oil with a side of Noodles.  Steam Soup Dumplings($4.99) Xiao Long Bao was average with the stuffing and soup however the Dough Wrap is what makes it average rather than great.  I even tasted the Gelatin Soup that didn't completely dissolved yet.  Whole Fish in Chili Oil ($19.99) is more than your Typical Fish in Chili Oil because this one is with a Whole Fish cut with Bones attached.  Head & Tail makes it a 'COMPLETE\" meal.  The regular version which they also have is with Fish Filets that makes it easier to consume but it could be of the Frozen variety.  It's A-OK if you can handle those TINY Fish Bones.  I do like that their Menu was mostly Photos so that my Dinner Friend can say \"No to this and No to that\".  There's still a lot of other interesting items on the Menu.  Hope that others will have a better experience with other items than we do.    :D"}
{"text":"Long time customer of this Northern Chinese Spicy Restaurant.   Every time we come, the spicy fish bowl with oil, chillies, and bean sprouts is a must! This is the main reason we come to this place.  It always good, but this particular time, the fish portion is drastically smaller then usual.  I would like to give this place 4 stars because I do recommend it to my friends and we've been coming for long long time. But we have recently discovered they try to charge us a more expensive price then the price listed on the menu. This has happened twice in a Roll already and everytime, they say it because they moved to a new POS.  Not to mention, they also charge 13% service on the bill, and this place is cash only.  Therefore I have problems with the operation of this business.   Nevertheless, my friends and I will still come here from time to time."}
{"text":"Ordered the Chili Chicken...there were lots of chilies but perhaps no chicken!!! The meat was the type you would feed your enemies animals.   The sauce tasted like boiled eyeballs, please do your stomach a favor and do not eat here!  Although you can donate your funds if you wish, because the server was very sweet."}
{"text":"New Greatime Corp? Hey what kind of business name is this??   New Greatime Corp is really a Northern Chinese Spicy Hot Restaurant. It might give some of their customers New Great Time.. but for us the experience is just Meh...   Good - Nice and Clean, it is opened recently - Excellent looking menu.. every single dish has a photo! Even diet coke! No 2nd guessing what you ordering  - Cheap Beer!! $2.50 for a Canadian VS Cplus for $1.50!  - TV showing popular Chinese game show! (when your dinner mate kept laughing and you think that he might have a good time eating with you!) - Open daily from 4 pm to 3 AM, good place for late night after clubbing meals!  Bad: Food is MEH! Dan Dan Noodle ($5.99) It is really spicy even for my standard as my friend just could not handle the heat. But the only good thing about the noodle is its spiciness.. soaked in hot oil..yes those are hot chilli oil not soup. The noodle is the store brought type.. meh. The portion is huge!   Whole Fish in Chili Oil ($20) All these chili peppers, floating in hot oil!! The fish is the fresh, not previous frozen. If you go with someone that will eat any part of a fish esp head then go ahead and order. Tons of veggie (bean sprouts/chinese cabbages) underneath, but think about them soaking in hot boiling oil! I find that it is not too spicy if you avoid eating those peppercorns.  Steam Soup dumplings ($5) Not a place for Northern Dim Sum. Though the dumplings are quite soupy and has decent flavour, but I find the skin quite doughy. They have to be eaten right away, if not the skin will turn hard and chewy!  New Greatime Corp is another hot and Spicy Sichuan restaurants opened up in the Scarborough/North York area. But it will not be the one I will recommend as a to go place if you have craving for some hot and spicy food.  Cash Only!"}
{"text":"Yikes. The food here are mostly spicy dishes, which is A+ for me because I love spicy foods. I started out with the boiled fish with spicy \"soup\", and honestly I couldn't finish past the second slice of fish because of how ridiculously oily it was. One bite and you're dripping oil everywhere. Gross. There was a bunch of other goods buried underneath the sea of dried rep peppers, such as crystal yam noodles, pig intestines, and bean sprouts - all that I missed out on until I packed it away for take out. Still too oily though. Wouldn't get it a second time, but it's fairly cheap for what you get, $12.99 for plentiful of fish and intestines.  I got the green bean cold noodles without peanuts due to my allergy and that came out sad and disappointing. It's honestly my fave dish at Chinese restaurants but there was way too much vinegar in mine that it tasted sour like it had gone bad. $6.99, not bad for the price, but still wouldn't get it again.   Lastly, I got the pig intestines with a variety of veggies and that was probably the highlight of my dinner. It would've made a great standalone dish with rice; came with lots of meat and a blend of veggies. Super great. Only downside to it is the fire that runs below it. If you don't eat fast enough or if you don't mix it once in a while, whatever's at the bottom gets burnt.   Service: Christ, the lady who took my order and passed my bill acted like she was on a pedestal or something. When I pointed to my order to notify her nicely that I can't have peanuts, she rudely asked me in Chinese \"so you're saying you don't want peanuts? Can't you speak Chinese?\" Lady, just because someone looks Chinese doesn't mean they can speak it. I can, but that's not the case with everyone. I just so happen to speak English first. We're in Canada, use the language. Then when she was bringing me the bill, she literally just slid the tray over while she was on her phone. She didn't even acknowledge me. They also charged me 13% service fee.   Dang, if I knew service was going to be this bad (I mean I came in knowing service wasn't going to be that great anyway) I would've gone to the pizza shop next door. But that's how it works with indie Chinese restaurants, I guess. Put the service fee on the bill so your patrons can't escape it, even if your service sucks. I left feeling a little ripped off, honestly.   Would I return? Probably not unless I'm in the area and desperate."}
{"text":"Hah, wow.. I guess I'm glad I stayed away from the dumplings since they don't seem to be getting any love.  I've been here a couple times now and have figured out what I like!  a) chili chicken.. a plate half full of chilis and deep fried chicken pieces.   b) deep fried beef comes in an giant ice cream cone basket-type thing. usually i'm not even a fan of sliced beef dishes but i liked it.  c) spicy green beans  All three are pretty (really) spicy so get a bowl of rice or try out their chrysanthemum drink in that red can (though it's too expensive imo).  This place seemed pretty authentic to me so I brought my friend, who's from Beijing here, and she said it was really authentic and she liked it.  That corner in the plaza they're in has had so much bad luck, going from a fish and chip place in the early nineties through so many random restaurants. I would come back here, despite the weird english name that had kept me from trying out this place from the beginning. They seem to be doing alright and it's been pretty busy the times I've been so I'm glad that finally someone seems to be doing alright there!"}
