{"text":"We stayed with you in August 2013. We checked in to the room in the afternoon and stayed through to the next day.  We were newcomer's to Naturism.  We wanted to thank you, your staff, and nudist members for making us feel welcome and for making our stay enjoyable and an experience that we will most certainly be repeating in the future.....I only wish we had come to experience it many years ago!  We really did not want to put our clothes back on to head home...but we did..."}
{"text":"I've been going here for about four summers now. The staff are great! The property is amazing! It's so nice to reconnect with nature au naturel! The lake is refreshing and lovely to swim in, there's more fish now! I felt my one brush by me!   I've gotten to know a lot of the members over the years and everyone is so down to earth.  The Bate Bistro serves breakfast, lunch & dinner at a reasonable rate.   The day fee prices & campsite fees are fair. If you have no car you can make arrangements for someone to pick you up at the GO bus or train stations, for an additional fee.   Someone introduced me to the park & I have introduced many to the park as well."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Bare Oaks and our first experience with Naturism other than on our own in private. We are a Gay Male couple from Barrie, ON in our 30's and Bare Oaks is about a 50 minute drive for us. We did tonnes of reading on Bare Oaks website before deciding to try it out. I won't lie, nerves were a little high as we turned in the driveway but they seem to subside quickly as you start to see people walking around nude. We decided to take our clothes off at the car before we went to the office to register and I recommend doing so, everyone including the person behind the counter in the clubhouse was nude so if you went in clothed you would likely feel more out of place than being nude. We got registered by a very friendly lady, watched the 10 minute compulsory video on the park history and video tour and we were off to explore the park on our own. It only took a few minutes of walking around before we came across a group of people playing a game called \"PÃ©tanque,\" as we walked by one of the members shouted \"Welcome To Bare Oaks!\" We walked around the whole park and back to the clubhouse area and grabbed a couple of chairs in the very large yard to soak up some sun for a while. There was a beach volleyball game on the go, the pool was busy, people sitting on the patio of the \"Bare Bistro,\" Lots of people around but nobody looks or stares at you, nobody cares what you look like, nobody invades your space, you can be as \"private\" or as social as you want to be. It didn't take long to run into another gay couple in the pool, and we noticed what we suspected to be quite a few gay couples throughout the day so it was nice to know we weren't the only ones. After sunning for a while we used the pool, the hot tub, had a bite to eat at the Bare Bistro, went for another walk around the park and repeated that a few times through the day and headed home around 6PM. All in all it was a great first visit and we can't wait to go back. If you are on the fence about visiting a Naturist Park I would highly suggest Bare Oaks for your first time. Everyone was friendly, nobody cares what you look like, free your body, free your mind!  P.S.  Listen to the Naturist Living Show which is available on iTunes among other places for free, it is hosted by the owner of Bare Oaks and is packed full of great information about the park and Naturism in general!"}
