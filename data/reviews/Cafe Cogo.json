{"text":"Lots of choices on the menu but nothing really stands out..   Service is slow.. food quality is not worth the price..very average chinese cafe style food.. very few combo choices available, \"soup+main dish+tea\" made it feel like a cash grab..  it is still a new cafe with much room to improve.."}
{"text":"Wonton Lo Mein Noodle took half an hour to receive after other food came out. Food was okay, portion size is decent, but they had pesky flies at our table."}
{"text":"Food is quick and mostly adequate. Had a really bad experience ordering the seafood pasta during happy hour and being served a full plate of noodles containing 1 piece of shrimp cut into 5 pieces. It absolutely had no place being called a seafood pasta. Realistically was more of a bean sprout and green onion pasta.   Waitress was expectedly indifferent about our unhappiness and basically acted as if it was absurd to expect more during happy hour.  I understand that customer service isn't always the priority in joints like this, but if I wanted to be completely Lied to about my food, there are plenty of cheaper options in the area."}
{"text":"This is truly a Chinese fusion restaurant.  It is one of the biggest of its type.  Once walked in, there is a large foyer and a waiting area with lot of seats.  The price is not expensive.  You can pick whatever type of food in the menu - Hong Kong caf√© style, noodle, congee, entrees, bubble tea, dessert, and BBQ pork/duck/chicken.  So each of you can order your own type.  We try the    which is ok.  The broiled pork rice and the fried bean with shredded pork are tasty.  The best is the BBQ pork wrapped in steamed bun.  The desserts which we did not order look so so in the display shelf.  This is the restaurant that you can come before you decide what you want to eat!"}
{"text":"Visiting here from Edmonton, my family didn't know any restaurants in the area until someone recommended Cafe Cogo which was a short walk from the hotel I'm staying at.  The restaurant is quite huge and spacious with a lot of seating. The decor is also very modern with the green and darker colours.  Table service here was a bit slow. Although the waiter gave us the menus, we had to wave and ask the staff to take our order. The food however came out pretty quickly. I ordered the Spicy Korean Cabbage with Bacon fried rice (they could've just wrote kimchi but oh well). Very tasty though wasn't as spicy as I thought. My strawberry bubble milk tea drink was pretty good and delicious, much better than other places I have been to.  If I'm ever in the Markham area again, I'll definitely come back for the good food and drinks."}
{"text":"**1/2 stars  A friend of mine tipped me off about this new restaurant.  As Jennifer K. stated, the menu is quite extensive and is basically an \"everything under one roof\" type of Chinese place.  They are trying to be a little bit of everything.  The restaurant itself is MASSIVE and used to be a Japanese AYCE restaurant.  While there are no shortage of staff, the service is a hit and miss.    The food here is pricier than your usual Congee Queen/HK-style cafe but the food is pretty good.  I've had their curries (though I wish it came with noodles instead of spaghetti as curry + spaghetti is just an usual mix).  The Ox Tongue Curry is quite good, very tender, and not overly cooked.  The Brisket Curry is just as good.  Their Beef Tendon + Beef Brisket Noodle in Soup is quite flavourful and most of the tendon pieces are quite soft, but you will get the odd piece that is thicker and therefore a bit harder to chew.  The Wasabi Shrimp is not \"stir-fried\" as they make you believe.  It is actually deep-fried.  Quite delicious and quite similar to a \"Thousand Island Shrimp\" dish.  The Tobiko and wakame strands on top are a great garnish."}
{"text":"Extremely misleading and false ads.  I was still reading ads from Chinese newspaper even after its closing.  Its website is still up and running as of now!"}
{"text":"So this is my second time here at cafe cogo.   A good friend of mine recommended me to this new restaurant but I didn't have a great experience the first time so I thought I would give it a second chance.  Both times I came here during lunch time so it was rather quite busy and noisy.  The first time I sat in the back behind the stairs, it is hard to get the attention of the waiters up there and it seems to be a bit noisier there then on the lower level.  One thing that bugged me a lot was the fact that there was a fly that kept on flying around both times I was there.  The waiters were fast and efficient but the first time I was there the waiters seem to always make up his own excuses as the food came a bit slower than I would have expected for a Chinese food restaurant like this one.  In fact this Chinese restaurant is probably one of the slowest in terms of ordering the food and waiting for it to arrive.  But the quality of the food is surprisingly good.   It has quality dim sum and the drinks are in big cups.     Not sure if it's because the restaurant is new but I felt like it was very clean aside from the fly that was flying around my table.  I gave this place three stars mainly because the food was good and in large portions.  If they can speed up the service I would consider coming here more often."}
{"text":"When you walk in, this place has a very different feel from the usual Chinese tea restaurants because it's bigger and roomier.  I've sat in the elevated seating area in the back and in the regular dining area, and the former is a lot louder so it's harder to have a conversation there.     The congee here is not bad, but the beef + tendon flat noodle in soup wasn't good (too many noodles, beef was tough.)  The dim sum here is surprisingly good for the type of restaurant that this is.  The Dynamic Siu Mai gets a thumbs up and is one of Cafe Cogo's specialties, the fried radish was breaded and fried well, and the spring roll is generously filled.  In terms of service, it's about what you expect for a Chinese restaurant.  There was an annoying fly both times that I've eaten here... If he becomes a regular here, I probably won't be."}
{"text":"Ordered the Penny sauce lo-mein.  The portion was HUGE.  Lots of noodles, but not enough sauce.  My hubby ordered the beef brisket & tendon lo-mein and same thing.  Lots of noodles, but not enough of the sauce.  The portion is definitely filling though and it is tasty.  I find that they are a tad more expensive then comparable restaurants.  The seating is spacious and service was great!  Food came out super fast (perhaps my order was super easy to put together).  We were in and out within 40 mins."}
{"text":"I've been here now for both happy hour and dinner. In terms of strictly food, I would give it a 4 stars.  I've tried the seafood pasta for happy hour. Since it's happy hour I didn't expect much from it in terms of seafood, but it was pretty good! For dinner I've had the diced steak with sesame, seafood pumpkin soup, and pasta of all kinds. Also of good quality.  Service, however, was a hit and miss, even though we actually know one of the waitresses. We've had portions of our order missed one time, and another time it took over 30 minutes for the last part of the meal to come.  Iced lemon tea I would not recommend here.  I'll come back if I'm nearby (say, shopping at Costco), but I wouldn't go out of my way.  Free wifi!"}
{"text":"Yet another one bites the dust. Overpriced bland food was the ataple of this restaurant. I'm actually glad they areno longer in business so people don't waste their hard-earned money at this money pit."}
{"text":"Cafe Cogo is like a hybrid of Congee Queen, Kenny's Noodles and Hong Kong Style Cafe.  The menu here is extensive!!   Congee, Cantonese Stir fried dishes, Soup Noodles, Dim Sum, Baked Rice, Snacks, Desserts, Drinks.....  Lunch (Mon - Fri), Afternoon (2:30-5:30), Dinner Specials  I have to select from over 20 choices for Afternoon tea set starting from $3 which includes a drink!  Rice Noodle with Fish and Beef Balls ($5.25) is delicious and I could tell that they use better ingredients than some of the other places I have been. My HK style milk tea is also smooth and silky!  The restaurant itself is surprisingly huge with ample seating. Since the place is new, everything is clean.   Service is a little slow though, as no one give me a menu or a glass of water until I kept asking! There's a bell on the table just like those Korean restaurants I been to! I should just push that bell and drive the wait staffs crazy instead of waving them down!!  BTW, they also has a separate drinks and dessert menu... I think I should come back for dessert next time.. (Black Sesame Pudding!!!)  10% grand opening discount!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night to meet up with a few friends.  It is located in a smallish plaza near my default Costco and there was ample parking when I went there.  The atmosphere is pretty hip, like the HK tea shops.  Going through the specials, I chose the typical HK diner steak meal for about $15.  It started out with some French bread with cream soup.  The bread was pre-buttered and toasted, so you have to eat it quickly before it cools down.  The cream soup was outstandingly good for the price I paid.  I dipped a bit of the bread into it as well while eating.  Next came the main course.  It was a large piece of 8 oz New York strip loin, I say large because it didn't curdle up to some small thin thing when you hear 8 oz.  It was presented on a bed of vegetables with some gravy sauce on top.  Beside it was a tear shaped mound of calrose rice.  They had made extra effort with the presentation.  However, the steak in itself was so-so but pretty much in par with what I had spent.  I really don't like the excess tough grizzle that you'd get with NY strip loins.  The rice added a bit of class to it though, it wasn't the cheap rice that you would normally get at other HK diner restaurants so I am quite pleased with that.  After the meal I got the mango pudding for dessert.  Surprisingly this was presented quite nicely as well.  It's not just some molded jello pudding put on a plate, it was in a nicely shaped glass that was designed for eating pudding.  Finally I got cold HK Style Tea.  When it first arrived, it was quite bitter and they hadn't given us syrup.  Though when it arrived, they also provided us with extra milk as well (I don't recall getting milk on the side with my tea with the exception of the restaurant in Monte Carlo Inns).  The reason this got a 4 over a 3 is the food and atmosphere were nice.  However, the service is still a bit poor and the lack of English skills is still an annoyance.  I would still go there again, which would be tonight actually with a different friend.  Will try the poached seafood this time around."}
