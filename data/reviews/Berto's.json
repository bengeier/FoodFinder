{"text":"Not bad. The decor is nice, and the place feels clean. The food is average I would say, though a little salty. Service is good. Good place to get your filipino fix, but definitely not anything spectacular."}
{"text":"My family and I had the opportunity to try this restaurant for lunch on a Tuesday. We ordered their TapSiLog which came with beef broth soup and the Berto's Combi Platter which also came with beef broth soup. The TapSiLog was good, and it was priced at around $9.75 which was decent. The beef was tender and flavourful, one could tell that they took the time to marinate it and had it sit with the spices, the rice was the same as my wife would cook at home and the eggs were done as it should be, the tops of the white were set and the yolks are still runny. As for the Berto's Combi Platter, well, YOU should try it! The platter came in at $27.95 and you'll be very surprised as to what you are getting in terms of what your actually paying for. As for myself, I think the price was very much well worth it. The platter serves 2-4 people. There was three adults in our party and we still had some leftovers to bring home. The platter came with everything that was listed on their ad. It was truly delectable. I even enjoyed the papaya relish that it came with which I've never had before. The grilled stuffed squid was also good. I usually cook my own as I've had complaints from my family when we go eat at other restaurants that the squid would either smell fishy or it still had the feather bone left in it because it wasn't cleaned properly but that wasn't the case here. The squid was also stuffed with tomato and other vegetables and it was quite enjoyable to eat although for the next time I would suggest to the cook to remove the fins as they become tough when you grill it as they cook very easily as they are very thin. I've already enjoyed the little things that was on display in their restaurant such as the Philippine currency, the little trinkets made of seashells and some pictures of some of the landmarks in the Philippines but the food presentation was a nice touch. The presentation was great and although it was not actually reminiscent of how they present food in the Philippines, adding their own flare with their presentation and having it on over on a banana leaf was nicely done. Lastly, service - fast, efficient and accurate. What more can one ask for from a restaurant. I was not there asking to be pampered. I went there to eat the food that I wanted and to get the food that I ordered in a reasonable time and that's exactly what I got on my visit. Also, one of the servers came by our table and asked us if everything was okay, and it was. It was truly an enjoyable visit and we'll come back again for sure."}
{"text":"1.5/5 Girlfriend found out about this place from her co-worker. So, us driving along Dundas, we decided to go here for Halo Halo (Their dessert). It was good. I decided to takeout Bopis. Unfortunately, it didn't smell nor taste good. Weird cause it smelled different than how it tastes. I won't try it again. I will try their other dishes though. But if it isn't good like the bopis, I will only go there for the Halo Halo."}
{"text":"Mmmm! This place serves some tasty kamayan feast food! We came to celebrate my aunt's birthday, and she really had a craving to try a kamayan feast. However, we didn't want to travel all the way to Toronto for Tinuno and so were delighted to find that Berto's in Mississauga serves combi platters, which are essentially very similar! We reserved a table and ordered two combi platter #1s in advance.  When we got there at 6:30pm, our platter was already ready. Unfortunately, not all members of our party were present so we had to wait until 6:50pm for the platter to be served. As such, by the time the platter was served, some of the skewers and meats had already cooled. The food came with a serving of soup for everyone, and the soup tasted interestingly like the broth you find in pho. There was an overwhelming flavour of cinnamon and cloves. I'm certain that there was a ton of MSG in the soup though, as we were all dying of thirst after.   The combi platter #1 came with a stuffed squid (filled with minced tomatoes and red onion), smoked milkfish, some pickled shredded papaya, mango salad, two skewers of chicken, two pork skewers, some roasted lechon and pork char siu, and four shrimp. I absolutely loved the squid and milkfish! The smokey flavour of the fish was very prominent, and the outside skin and extremities were delightfully crispy. The grilled shrimp was also delicious - my shrimp was grilled to the point where I was able to consume everything as it was so crispy. Overall, the food was delightful, and even better was the fried rice! The garlic flavour was very fragrant.  Berto's had made a slight mistake and thought that we had only ordered one platter for six people, and so they had to rush to prepare our second platter. As such, when the second arrived, the fish, squid, and rice were much hotter than the ones served before. As a result of the heat, the fried rice was also slightly mushier and wetter, but nevertheless just as tasty! The second squid (unpictured) was also significantly larger in size, and the second platter came with two slices of salted egg (they had missed that order in the previous platter).  The two combi platter #1s were more than enough to feed six people, and the food was surprisingly good! We will definitely come again to sample the other food - particularly the halo halo! The dessert is without doubt one of Berto's signature dishes, as almost everyone passing through the restaurant ordered one!"}
{"text":"My family and I are visiting from out-of-town and were hungry after a long day of driving! We happily found Berto's near our hotel and were immediately greeted with very friendly staff. We ordered combi platter 1 which was more than enough for 4, plus a side of soup! The food came quickly and was presented nicely for family style to share. Everything on the plate was delicious the shrimp, squid, bangus, bbq pork/chicken, roasted pork and lechon. I appreciated the grilled eggplant, mango salad and pickled papaya--generally do not see vegetables at Filipino restaurants! We received attentive service throughout the meal. The rice was so delicious we ordered another side to share! In general they offer a lot of options on their menu and serve all day breakfast--which I may have to try before I leave town!"}
{"text":"Tried the chiken BBQsilog this time, but I still like the Tapsilog than other places. The meat is very well marinated and very flavorful. The garlic rice is very yummy with the running yolk flowing down and mingling with it. Perfect!!! This place serves very delicious Filipino food in mississauga!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to impress my visitors relatives and friends. Prices are reasonable and the food is not bad at all."}
{"text":"The place is not really big, but it is really cozy. Very filipino. Love it!  The staffs were very nice. The girl in the cash was really helpful. Super magalang :) I love their silog menus.  I ordered their tocilog, and sago-gulaman. The serving was not too big and not too small, just enough for myself. Thumbs up for their garlic rice!  The puto and silvanas were so good too. All in all, Berto's is a good place to go if you're craving for some silog, mami, lugaw, and some pinoy desserts."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Never had tapa that is wet! At 10:45 am at least 3 breakfast items on the menu was out already. And the sinangag rice had burnt rice (tutong) in it. And to top it off these Filipinos having a birthday celebration sang happy birthday at the top of their lungs 10 times!!! Really you are not in Quiapo or a palengke. Have consideration for other customers who want peace while having breakfast! Geez!!! And one more thing we were told that one item we were ordering was no longer available, all gone!  Lo and behold the waitress brought it out for us. It was chicken inasal but we refused it because first we already ordered something else and second it looked like fried chicken with Frank's Red Hots on top of it. Did not look appetizing at all. And the sago gulaman tasted well water! Never again! Crossed this testaurant off my list when we go to Canada."}
{"text":"We were just here this morning. They have a good selection of silog dishes. My husband had daing silog. It's pretty delicious and of decent size. It comes with egg and garlic rice. I had palabok. The dish is one of their bestsellers. A lot of patrons ordered it while we were there. It's delicious and for $7+, it's reasonably priced.  They also served us a complimentary hot beef broth which was soothing and delicious. It tasted like a pho broth.   I'm giving it 4 stars because the place was hot while we were there. I don't know if the aircon wasn't working or the place is just hot.   I'd go back to try their mami and lomi when the weather gets a little cooler."}
{"text":"I came here on one of my non-vegan days (i.e. weekend with family day) and we ordered Mami (noodles in beef broth with egg and veggies and your choice of meat) and the beef pares silog (comes with fried rice).  The Mami was okay, but the beef pares silog was delicious and had a really good flavour to it. As Stephanie S said, the fried rice is delicious.    While this place is in a really shabby plaza, the interior of the restaurant is well decorated and very clean.  The owners and servers were very friendly and made every customer feel like family.   Verdict: It's probably one of the better Filipino restaurants I've been to."}
{"text":"Very typical. Every restaurant got the Silog foods.  What is new, whenever I go to any Pinoy restaurant it is the same fashion."}
{"text":"I usually order tapsilog every time I come here to eat but came with a few friends and we shared this new platter they offered. Came with pork and chicken barbeque, grilled squid, bangus, grilled liempo, lechon kawali, shrimp and some veggies. We ordered 2 extra rice since meal came with just 2 and 4 of us shared the platter.  We all ordered halo-halo after. Everything tasted good and will definitely come back.  By the way, comes with free soup as well!"}
{"text":"I dropped in tonight to satiate a craving for Flilipino poods. My order was small consisting of Pancit Bihon and Garlic Rice. It was an almost full house when I got there. Service was fast and friendly. This is only my first visit and it won't be my last. I really enjoyed my Pancit. It was very delicious. The Garlic Fried rice was yummy too. I still want to try their Log dishes. They sound so appealing. I have to say that the restaurant was clean and the decor was nice. Kudos to the girls at the front counter. Plenty of parking too. It is located at the south east corner of Dundas and Erindale Station. Bookmark this place and try out the Flip Noodles. Peace out Yelpers!   Thanks to Steph for the Intel on this place."}
{"text":"First pinoy resto to have Beef Pares in their menu and i must say it lived up to my expectation. Served with it are garlic fried rice, eggs and soup just like back home. The rice i believe is more than one cup, very generous and will save you from ordering extra rice.  Friendly staff and quick service. I just hope they stay this way."}
{"text":"It was my first time here today and I was secretly pleased with how very accommodating this place is, although there are a few tables available as of the moment, so I cant wait to see what their expansion would be like after they finished renovation.   Their menu in general is pretty good and they have the classic dishes that is pretty much popular in the Philippines. So if your a native then you know some of them.   Anyway, I ordered from their silog menu which is the Tapsilog (beef marinate) that came with fried rice topped with a sunny side up egg with a slice of a tomato and cucumber with a little bit of atchara (a pickle from unripe papaya). It was quite tasty and the portion was above average for me...plus it also came with a free soup on the side.   And my partner just chose two dishes (both beef dishes that I forgot the name of --sorry!) with rice and he also got a free soup with it. He liked it as well.  We also ordered Halo-halo (worth it!) and their special sago + gulaman (good, but way too sweet for my taste). And their puto (pre-packaged) was also good too.   Anyway, its worth it going here when you want to eat traditional filipino food. Worth the money (lets say for two people it can cost you about 25-30$ estimate -- I mean, this is dessert included) or just go there for dessert or an item for one and obviously it will cost less.   And plus the place is well ventilated and the staff is so nice and friendly.  I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I went here with my husband to have a brunch. He ordered PARES with Eggs and fried rice and I ordered Daing na bangus with eggs and fried rice too.   The beef pares was ok. There was nothing special about the taste. I had Pares at Jonas in Caloocan, Philippines multiple times and so, I know very well how an authentic pares will taste like. They also served the beef pares cold  -the bowl was warm but the meat itself was cold which tells me that food was microwaved. Such as shame!  The daing na bangus was good. The flavour was there. The fish was store bought - I can tell because I buy those 3 in a pack too. Im not expecting a fresh coz Im in Canada! I have to mention that I waited 30 mins for my dish and so I my husbands dish has been sitting on the table for 20 mins. Just fyi, 5 customers after me go their dishes already  Overall, the food was okay. I gave it a 2 stars for food and service."}
{"text":"4.5! Just came back from the Philippines earlier this year and this place just took me right back!   First off BRAVO for the all day breakfast! And it comes with free soup on the side! Already a fave!  Came here twice in a row, so I feel it's only fair to do a review!  I came during dinner time and lunch time, both times were busy but not packed. As we entered the restaurant, I noticed the decor immediately, from historic pictures of the Philippines and different nik-naks on the shelf symbolizing what Philippine culture is all about. It's great, clean, cozy and kid-friendly.  You have to order in the main cash and if your going to eat in, they will give you your receipt and a table number.  For lunch:  I ordered Tapsilog (fried sliced beef with rice and eggs. It also comes with pickled veggie called Atchara and a slice of cucumber and tomatoe) , and Iced Tea (mmm, refreshing!) While my Dad ordered rice with Caldereta (Tomatoe base beef stew with peppers).  Both dishes were a good portion and they both came with soup! The soup is a beef base I believe, just by looking at the dark colour and the bold taste it has. It's not salty. It's just right!! You can serve yourself ice water by the cutlery station.   The service was fast and the servers were kind!  For Dinner: I ordered longsilog ( Filipino sweet breakfast sausage and rice with egg), also came with soup. My Fiancé  got the Beef Pares Silog ( beef adobo like stew) with rice and eggs. Both dishes were Great! No complains, I just had too much rice #firstworldproblems  We also ordered the siomai and it was really good!! A must try, the sauce is what made this dish amazing!   My only concern about this place is, if a first timer came into this restaurant, I wouldn't know that I had to place my order first, and second the people ordering for take out, all wait in the front after ordering and it just makes it more congested in the front and some servers get confused and flustered.   Overall great restaurant and I would def come back!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better Filipino restaurants in Mississauga, if not THE best Filipino restaurant in Mississauga. Located at the northeast corner of Dundas Street West and Erindale Station Road (it's in the plaza where Rose Bakery is), there's a decent amount of parking and this place is easy to find (the restaurant faces Dundas Street W).  My parents and I visited on a Friday evening and were pleasantly surprised by, a) the variety of the menu, b) how very clean and modern the space was (you feel comfortable here), and c) that the food was quite good and well-prepared! Here's how it works: you walk in, grab a table, order at the front, pay, and they bring you the food when it's ready. Our food took about 15 minutes to prepare.  We ordered a variety of the 'silog' dishes (around $8.00 each), which are prepared meals traditionally served at breakfast. We ordered the 'Tapsilog' (marinated beef strip 'tapa'), 'Daingsilog' (fried fish), and 'Tocilog' (sweet cured chicken and pork), which were all served with delicious garlic fried rice, fried egg, and picked veggies. All were delicious - if you're new to Filipino food, start off with the Tapsilog. The beef was soaked in delicious marinade and paired deliciously with the fried rice. Portions were above-average in size (better than other Filipino restaurants in the area). Prices are average. Service is nice and friendly. They also have a hot table at the front for take-out.  For drinks, we also ordered the 'Sago at Gulaman' ($3.00), which my cousins and I always joke as the Filipino bubble tea. It's basically a sweet cold drink full of brown sugar, tapioca and various jellies. I found Berto's Sago way too sweet, but the jellies were soft and super fresh.  My parents and I will definitely be back. Note that there aren't many tables (the place seats around 20 people total), so perhaps not the best for really big groups.  For 4 'Silog' dishes and 2 drinks, with tax, and tip, we paid around $48.00."}
{"text":"Lunch at Berto's (with Mrs. B) - (Dundas).. the chicken curry is good, very Pinoy style, the chicken is boneless! the dinuguan is ok, (Carinderia is still the one for me when it comes to dinuguan).  Their portions are generous! so a 2-sides is ok to be shared, just order an extra rice!  I like the presentation, better than Carinderia - they use real plates and metal fork and spoon.  Their ice tea is super good! a real one! not too sweet! and very reasonable 1.50! the Mami is a bummer - they use instant noodles! We will come back again to try other food, the owners are very friendly! They have a lot of staffs which is good for the business (less waiting time)  PS. The washroom is not that clean, they need to give an extra eye on this one."}
{"text":"Ordered: Pares-silog, $7.95. Inasal chicken-silog, $7.95. 3 buko pandan desserts, $3.75@.  Worth the trip to Berto's.   Both silogs were prepared fresh. The beef-pares is ordinary (taste is similar to pork asado).  The buko pandan was not exceptionally sweet.  Their siopaos (chicken asado) are popular at $1.75 each.  Did not get to order one; they ran out of them."}
{"text":"This was my first time and I got take out for the family.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  Everything we got tasted freshly made and tasty.  The two entrees we got - pork adobo and pork cooked in coconut milk were quite good.  We also enjoyed the palabok, Shanghai lumpia, BBQ chicken skewers, and garlic fried rice.  Got my kids a mango bubble tea which was tasty with purple tapioca pearls and possibly lychee gelatin."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Delicious food, well-priced. Recently renovated space. Love the simple decorations. A favorite place to go! :)"}
{"text":"Contrary, to what most people think, I am not Filipino.  So as I entered, the other diners present + the cashier appeared a bit confused as I had quite a few questions about the menu.  Silog - This is what I ordered for takeout.  These are rice dishes that you're supposed to eat for breakfast.  The Beef Pares (chunks of brisket) that I ordered really reminded me of the broken rice dishes, complete with the fried egg, that you get at Vietnamese restaurants, BUT the ones at Berto's came with garlic fried rice (really good!) and stewed meat instead of something grilled.  The brisket itself was very similar to Chinese five-spices beef brisket, although it seemed to be cooked with a bit more care as beef was a nice reddish-brown colour, pieces were cut smaller, more evenly, and there was many a coupla different spices used.  Meat was very tender.  Portion was sizeable, I couldn't finish it all.  Came to about $9 'n change.  Good home cooking.  Interior:  Although it's not in the nicest strip mall, I was impressed by the interior of the restaurant.  Owners did a really good job to sorta remind you that you're in the somewhat rundown John Anderson plaza!  Since it's an indie in my area, I'll definitely go back, probably not for pancit (I never crave this), but probably the soup noodle dishes &/or the desserts!"}
{"text":"Whats included in these meals is that they all come with a beef broth as a starter.  It was very flavourful, but reminded me of the beef broth from the Nissan instant noodles.  The meats are then served on top of a garlic fried rice (sinangag), and eggs (itlog).  Usually the egg comes sunny side up.  We requested the eggs to be cooked through, and the cashier looked at us funny but obliged at our weird request anyways.  For our lunches (breakfasts), we ordered the beef pares silog, tosilog, and the longsilog.  The beef pares is a beef brisket, which was very tender, but my complaint is that the pieces were too small.  I guess maybe it's because it helps the beef cook down faster that way?  The tosilog, had tocino, pieces of fried pork.  Kind of reminded me of a cross between a pork chop and pork jerky.  There was a bit of sweetness in it as well.  The longsilog had longanisa which is a sausage.  While I didn't expect to like it, because I'm not a fan of sausages, I did actually like it quite a bit.  Pretty good tasting meal.  And good pricing as well, $8+tax and tip."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for lunch.  The place was packed!  It's decent sized with a lot of seating but they were all filled.  You order first and then sit down with a number.  The menu is on the wall and doesn't really describe what the dishes are as they're just the Filipino dish names.  However, the food was quite delicious!  No wonder it was so busy.  We ordered the beef pares silog which is beef brisket on flavoured rice and a fried egg.  The beef was very tender.  We also got the longsilog.  This was my favorite.  The sausages were so yummy!  We also got the pancit bihon and palabok noodles.  Both were alright but I definitely liked the silog dishes more.  We also got the lumpiang Shanghai which were spring rolls (we got half chicken half pork) and some dough dessert with cheese on it which both were ok but nothing spectacular.  Would come back again for the longsilog.  Also lots of people ordered the halo halo drink/dessert which I'm looking forward to trying? next time"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times and the food is always really fresh and delicious. The restaurant and staff are welcoming, and you can tell that they take a lot of pride in the food. The garlic fried rice was amazing!! The beef pares is worth trying along with Halo Halo for dessert. If you follow their Facebook page you can see photos of dishes they offer, it might help if you're not familiar with traditional Filipino dishes."}
{"text":"I like this place. Not fancy but cleanlined decor. More Cafe style than restaurant. And a good list for the typical flip breakfast and dishes that are out. They also had a bit of everything - cooked dishes and packaged treats - the pickled green papaya, the suman, the leche flan, puto, pandesal, enseymada (sp?), suman, calamansi juice, pretty good chicharoon and more things that I do not know the names of but recognize. Tasty.  You can take out or sit in their cafe style place.  A good place to bring friends to introduce to filipino food. Will be back and I would recommend"}
{"text":"This was my firsy time at Berto's I went here last week on a Monday with a friend at lunch. For other first timers, you have to order first, then take your seat, the server does not greet you at the table to give you a menu.    I ordered a combo with sinigang and dinuguan and a coconut water. I paid and went back to my seat. I was a little confused if the lady was going to bring the food to the table or if I was supposed to wait and bring it myself. But she actually brought it to the table and brought cutlery. There were sauces on display to use with the dishes but I did not realize until after.    I wish the diniguan had more spice and less fat on the meat. But everything was very good. Portion size was good for the price.  I was glad to see they sold sansrival.  I will probably order that next time. I ordered a small Leche flan from the fridge and my friend got halo halo. Both very good.   Later, the server took our dishes away from our table.   It qas not too busy the time I went so we stayed and talked until we were done with our food. Nice environment and nice staff. Would go again!"}
{"text":"Very good filipino food at a decent price! Sometimes when I'm not home, I just crave some good home cooked filipino food - and this place definitely delivers that - home away from home! I definitely like this place more than others as the price is more reasonable. The garlic fried rice is perfect and always hits the spot with the fried egg and its yolky goodness. They have lots of sauces there to go along with the dishes - my personal favorite is the spicy garlic vinegar (this actually runs out fairly quick). The atmosphere is nice - very clean and the employees are really friendly. They also do catering!"}
