{"text":"Best lattes and sandwiches ever! Just the right amount of everything, made with utmost care. Perfect!"}
{"text":"I just moved to a new building downtown and all of my old coffee shops are now too far away (I'm lazy) so I decided to go try Sandpresso. I ordered a latte so I cannot comment on the food (yet, I'll be back to try those I'm sure) and I really liked the coffee! It's worth the trip to visit if you work downtown and the owner was very friendly!"}
{"text":"Really great coffee shop in between downtown and the strip.  I think it may even be better than 21st Street Coffee.  This location also serves some Korean food.  The bulgogi sandwich was not bad.  I would like to try some other things on the menu.  Nevertheless, the mocha I had here was a winner.  I definitely will be back.  It's a must try if you're near the convention center or working nearby."}
{"text":"The food offerings are a bit interesting, but I made it just in time to get a fresh baked scone.  Clearly not made from scratch, but still delicious.  The latte is good and way better than the watered-down espresso of Crazy Mocha.  They have coffee happy hour from 7a - 9a, so I am looking forward to going back for a good cup of coffee in the morning.  On this side of downtown there are NO decent coffee shops, so I am excited to find this place."}
{"text":"Sandpresso is one of those places that can be easy to zip past without knowing its there or if its open. Yesterday, I was working my old noon-to-8 shift and needed a cold lunch for later, so I figured that this deli might be worth a try.  After doing some research, I discovered that Sandpresso is a chain, and that this Strip District location is the first Sandpresso in the United States.   http://www.sandpresso.com  \"Ahhh,\" you're saying. So was I.  Sandpresso sells not only sandwiches but coffees, frappes (!), and even sushi, bibimbap, and bulgogi! However, I wanted to stick with something I could just keep in the fridge and not have to reheat later, so I did what the Post-Gazette's Munch did and ordered an egg salad. How New York is that?  Portion-wise, it will not astound you. That could be a Korean trait considering that we're living in Supersized America, and being guilty of big-eating myself, I probably would have liked more egg salad in my sandwich. I also think the egg salad itself could have used some salt, but in the aggregate, this was one tidy sandwich complete with a leaf of lettuce and a sliver of tomato. The sandwiches themselves must take more time to wrap than prepare as mine was somewhat difficult to remove from its wax paper prison. The bread, which may or may not have been toasted, had a stylish pattern on it of some sort. Was a panini press involved?  A very vibrant, chunky fruit salad of pineapple, strawberry, and melon accompanied my sandwich along with a dense, chewy chocolate chip cookie.   Bulgogi? Subway, may you be derailed.  P.S. It's next to Eide's!!!"}
