{"text":"Welcome home, Nova Scotia girl. Welcome home.  There really isn't anything like a taste of home when you're so far away from it. This is the only Pizza Delight west of Ontario.  The owners are from Summerside, P.E.I., and probably understand the profit possibilities of bringing this New Brunswick-based chain out to the city filled with ex-pat Maritimers.  I worked in a Pizza Delight when I was 17, so I'm familiar with the menu. It has barely changed in 20 years and the Evergreen menu is authentic.  What's better? The donair sauce is authentic. Although Pizza Delight doesn't have the best donair sauce in Nova Scotia (ahem ... King's), it is the best you can find in Calgary.  I corralled a couple of Nova Scotia girls and a handful of other friends and went for garlic fingers. I'll let Spencer and Chelsea share their own experiences but the three Bluenosers were quite sated and satisfied.  What are garlic fingers? Pizza dough slathered in garlic butter, doused in mozzarella, sprinkled with Parmesan and showered with love.   Then you dip them in the donair sauce. Oh. My. God.  There will be another trip in the future because as Dee mentioned, the French onion soup - if it's the same as I remember - is divine.   Garlic fingers and donair sauce, French onion soup and a pepperoni, mushroom and pineapple panzerotti.  Feast for a princess, right there."}
{"text":"This is the only Pizza Delight in town. If you've never tried it, you owe it to yourself. The pizza has possibly the best sauce you can find and the crust is light and fluffy. The chain started in New Brunswick in the 60s and there's a lot more in the Maritimes than here. But they really only need one here. It's delicious and it reminds transplanted Maritimers of home. But you don't have to be from there to enjoy it. Simply great pizza that they never mess up. Good choice of pastas, too. Try it sometime."}
{"text":"Well, this place is a little piece of heaven for a Maritimer lost in the West.  I can even tell you that I probably yelled \"shut the front door\" when I was told that there was a Pizza Delight in Calgary.  And, I also can't express my excitement when I saw that beacon of light of a logo of theirs when we were pulling up to the lot.  Flashes of supremely delicious garlic fingers and donair sauce danced in my head and they did not disappoint.  I'm pretty sure our very young waitress thought we were crazy when we asked for a full bowl of donair sauce for dipping, but she graciously obliged (probably not to stir the crazy ladies).  We most likely ate our weight in garlic fingers, which are so delicious, and of course had some nice bottled Alexander Keith's to seal the Maritime deal.  And, even though we may have scared off a nearby family with our excitement, our server still did pretty well handling us and being polite.  Very fun night and I will definitely be stopping by here again... bringing some Westerners in tow!"}
{"text":"Go here just for the Garlic Fingers. You won't regret it! Try the French Onion Soup. Pizza is great too. Heck this place is awesome all around."}
