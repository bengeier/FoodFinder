{"text":"Must try on Queen West!!!  I had a beef gyro in this place, and it was the best that I have ever had! The place is new and look very clean and the food is amazing. They have a special hot sauce that everyone should give a try!"}
{"text":"I ordered on Foodora for delivery.  It arrived quickly and warm.  This said, the reviews on Yelp were quite misleading, and why I am compelled to post.  Portions were generous, but definitely lacking in flavour. Chicken was much better than beef. To me a Donair has a distinct flavour, but this was not even reminiscent of that taste.  The \"special\" was literally fatty beef over potatoes. Potatoes were way overdone and bland.  I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Great new place with a unique Turkish twist on some delicious Greek / Lebanese style food . I also highly recommend trying the imported Turkish drinks , the Sour Cherry is perfect with a Chicken Gyros ."}
{"text":"Fantastic taste and quantity! Love the fries in the pita. Customer service is top notch. Ask for both chicken and beef in your meal. They are willing to mix things up for you."}
{"text":"Great addition to the foodora delivery menu. Love the beef special over garlic potatoes. The chicken gyro was delish as well and stuffed with chicken."}
{"text":"Real food real people. This hole in the wall Turkish/Greek take out place near queen st on john is absolutly my new favorite place for gyro/doneir wraps.   I have tried their beef doneir sandwich and chicken gyro platter so far and both were delicious. Specialy i like their old school way of marinating the beef steaks (not frozen ground meat gyros)and chicken. Georgeus portions and friendly service.    I definetly recomment this place to anyone who wants some real food. Note: if you go there ask extra sauces (tzatziki, garlic sauce and hot sauce) they are homemade and best in the town. I wish they were closer to where i live."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place based on the review.  Pretty disappointing.  Nothing special - feel like all these reviews are friends or customers who haven't had a real gyro.  First order: 2x chicken souvlaki pita, beef pita, gyro pita.  Received: 3x souvlaki,  1 gyro pita, NO beef.  Also mixed up all the labels so friend who wanted the Gyro never even got to enjoy it.  Other than messing up the entire order, taste was normal nothing special.  Decided to try one more time because the reviews just didn't make sense... so instead did a plate order.  Second order: 1 chicken gyro plate, 1 beef plate.  Taste was disgusting, worse than the pita, and dripping in oil.  The gyro plate was not in \"slices\" as they said they typically serve their gyro when the order was made - it was crumbles of fatty and oily meat, with lack luster seasoning.    I did let the manager know after my second order how I felt and he was genuinely caring and said he would take care of it next time for me; due to the issues of both orders.  Good right?  Nope.  Received a call right after from the owner with a long winded forceful presentation regarding my second order, about what I got was how they serve gyro's and how everyone serves gyro's - mind you, i know what a gyro is - he doesn't own the definition of gyro - he just serves bad versions of it.  After his forceful explanation, he insists he will still give me a free item because \"the customer is always right\" (except when apparently they are wrong and need a phone call to tell them they are wrong... but they are also still right?  I guess?).    Customer service isn't just about giving free stuff away because you cant put together simple orders or mask your mediocre food.  And when you say a customer is right, understand the meaning of it... it doesn't mean giving away free stuff - it means understanding what the customer is saying instead of pushing your bad food on them.  If the food was decent enough, I could let all this slide... but it's all just an overpriced gyro spot."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely fantastic!!! The owner is so very nice and the place is very clean and bright!! Can't wait to go back!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken gyro. It was filling and cheap. My only complaint was that my chicken had some parts that were a bit hard and tough to chew. However, it's tasty and well worth the money. I'll be back to try the beef donair next time!"}
{"text":"Very good food. One of the best I've had in Toronto in this category. Very filling. Enjoy !"}
{"text":"Sadly I can only give them 3 stars, I had high hopes for this place but was slightly disappointed. The presentation looked great I had the large plate with half meat half chicken over rice. Except the meat was hard and dry and not juicy like it should be for shawarma meat and it was slightly salty. They put white garlic sauce that looks like tiziks sauce. The hot sauce really makes the meal better."}
{"text":"This is my go to shawarma place. They never mess up my order and food is always great. 4 stars for the food and service, the girl working the front is always friendly. Portions are very generous as well. Lately they've been getting stingy with the garlic sauce. The tastiness of your gyro will vary based on who made it. Minus 1 for the lack of seating. They have these tiny stools to sit down and it is a very tiny space. They need to open outdoor seating during the summer."}
{"text":"Amazing Gyro overall. I love around the corner from the restaurant and go about once a week. Overall, their price is fantastic and their quality is great. The chicken gyro was very good and the fries and sauce were a nice touch.   In addition, the staff is extremely friendly and even gave me a free drink because they had just opened!"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical about the amount of five star reviews from new Yelpers, but caved and gave Oh My Gyro a try. The reviews didn't lie!  For around $8 including taxes you can get a pita stuffed with your choice of meat, French fries, onions and sauce. My favourite is the beef Donair which hits the spot every time. The sandwiches are made fresh to order and are absolutely delicious.   There are a ton of cheap eats in the area but this place wins hands down for me. For the price it can't be beat!  Pro tip: Go eat in the newly redesigned Grange Park just up the street.  Pro tip 2: Grab some wet naps, you'll need them!"}
{"text":"Huge portions at a great price here.  I got the signature plate with garlic potatoes and beef.  They drench it in garlic sauce, which was amazing.  The plate is really heavy so make sure you are hungry when you come here.  Some pieces of beef were a bit dry but nothing too bad."}
{"text":"Ok, first of all let's set the record straight. Although it is on their menu, they do not serve donair (doner).  They have beef and chicken shawarmas.  I ordered the beef donair sandwich and got a beef shawarma sandwich - I did not see donair anywhere in the restaurant.  I walked over there from work which was about a 10 minute walk in the cold becuase of all the good reviews, boy was I disappointed.   When I arrived, they had all the doors open and it was freezing cold and windy.  How was I supposed to eat my food there in the cold?  They only have 4 bar stools and it can get very tight during a lunch rush (if there is a lunch rush).  So I had to take my sandwich with me back to work and eat it luke warm.  I ordered my sandwich with hot sauce (as indicated on my reciept) even though I saw him put a drop of hot sauce, there was absolutely no spice in this at all - mildest sandwich I've ever had.  They overstuffed the sandwich with onions, omg how much onions can a person tolerate.  The shawarma meat was very dry, and yes there was sauce dripping out of my sandwich which would be ok if it had taste.  They also put soggy fries into the sandwich.  Overall - just very bland.  There are much better shawarma joints in the city.  If this was the last place left on earth, I might go back..."}
{"text":"Delicious Gyros!! This is probably the best gyros in the GTA !! I had a chicken gyros with spicy which is homemade and very tasteful. They are superb- fresh, delicious gyros with HUGE portion size. ( best one than I've had at other places)  If you are in need of a quick, affordable, tasty meal to have it, this is a great option. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"For whatever reason, I've enjoyed the various fast food at this little joint beside the Starbucks at Queen and John over the years and OMG continues the tradition of meat on a spit tempting you in for the garlic sauce and house made hot sauced dripping wraps. It's a tiny spot with room for 3 stools smack against the wall with a mirror letting you wipe your face as you know it will be getting some collateral damage with those great sauces. Many people get the chicken gyro, but I had the beef donair which is similar, just with beef. Best thing about OMG is their penchant for putting fries on everything. Everything. Mmmmmm. Everything in a good way. They even list a chicken on fries as a menu item which is similar to poutine, without the cheese and gravy. (They told me poutine is on their radar). The prices are decent, the staff is helpful and attentive (every world problem, looking at you Venezuela, means To gets some good people), and the size of these wraps will weigh you down with their ampleness. Veg option is the falafel so no need to avoid this spot. No wifi, and no washrooms here so get over to Starbucks and pickup a frappaccino for dessert."}
{"text":"While running late for supper from a meeting nearby that over ran I was in the mood for a quick meal. This place was bookmarked due a lot of good reviews and a ROTD to boot.  This spot is geared towards the grab and go crowd during the day as there is minimal seating. Ordering is relatively simple as I tried the OMG special you choose the base (fries, rice etc.)  I tried the fries and chicken on this visit and order it hot.  The portion is sizable. The taste hmm the fries are OK. The meat was quite dry IMO and the sauce helped make it palatable.  They are priced quite reasonably but with a much better spot nearby IMO this place deserves 3 stars."}
{"text":"This was a good quick meal. I am visiting Toronto from the USA. I had a chicken gyro plate with rice and potatoes. The rice was undercooked and crunchy. I added hot sauce to the chicken which was good. The food was good, a mediocre meal. I am suspect about the reviews on here that proclaim that this place is the best of the best around the area.   There are many good places around here to eat. To me the food was ok. It was a good place for a quick meal. It was not in the top 10 gyro places I have ever eaten...."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick hearty meal. Huge portion. A bit busy during lunch hour rush, but a testament to the great food they serve"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall but awesome quality Gyro.... get extra meat if you want to skip dinner :)"}
{"text":"I happened upon this place while walking around. After checking out the reviews I realized I needed to try it. The reviews were right. Again. The food was all super fresh and the plate I ordered was huge. And oh so delicious. I got the chicken gyro. There was lots of chicken on a bed of rice. It came with a Greek salad and potatoes. The chicken had great flavor as well as the potatoes. The salad was super. It was made with spring mix salad and had cucumbers and tomatoes on it too.   There really isn't a great place to eat inside, other then a few bar stools along a wall. I took my meal outside and walked a few buildings down toward the park where I found a bench to sit on. It was perfect.   I would highly recommend you checking this place out. The prices are reasonable and the portions are large."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times since it opened and it's been sooooo good every time. My new go-to for gyros. The garlic potatoes were bomb too. The staff were very helpful and kind. Keep up the awesome work!"}
{"text":"This is pretty much a take-out place. There are 4 seats on the side but you'll be sharing space with people standing in line for ordering, so it's not really suitable. There are some seats outside as well.  Ordered a large OMG signature with chicken, garlic potatoes, and hot sauce on the side.  They provided an order number, but they don't use the number to call the orders out when it is prepared. They also weren't sure what we ordered and asked for the receipt to check. Seems to be a disconnect in the process somewhere.  The box comes with a lot of food. The take-out boxes have compartments so while it's still a lot of food, it's not AS much as you might be thinking based on the pictures alone. It comes with quite a number of potato wedges. I think you're getting at least 2 or 3 whole potatoes worth. The chicken felt over-cooked and was too dry for my liking. The pieces were very small, very thin, and borderline crunchy.  The generous use of sauce all over the food was a bit unfortunate for me, as all I was tasting throughout the meal was sauce.  It would be better if they had some more variety in the box. From the menu, it looks like you really only have a choice between meat and potatoes, or meat and rice. Smothered in garlic sauce and tzatziki. I like sauce, but not when the purpose of adding it is to make your dish flavorful because then what's the point of getting the dish in the first place.  Someone ahead of me was getting the plate, but the cashier asserted that the signature was a better deal as it's basically the same thing. Getting a plate might have been better as it comes with meat, rice, potatoes, and salad, and judging from the pictures, it's about the same portion for about the same price anyways.  2-stars for the food. +1 for filling up the box I guess."}
{"text":"I passed by because I was super hungry and needed a quick to go snack. I got the chicken shawarma. Did not like it mainly because was not authentic at all. Usually I enjoy all the fixins, and I typically just tell whoever is making it to put everything inside the shawarma or gyro wrap. I did the same this time, but they only offer peppers, lettuce, tomato and onion. I also asked for medium sauce which wasn't spicy at all. And all the sauce was at the bottom of the wrap. So when I got to the the bottom, it was soggy and just unappealing. Same with the middle of the wrap. It was just like a handful of lettuce. The chicken pieces are huge so it's almost an impossible mission when you take a bite out of the wrap. I think overall, the inconsistency with the wrap and the huge chunks of chicken and veggies just made it all so hard and unappealing to eat."}
{"text":"Love the food! - I've been a pretty frequent customer ever since Oh My Gyro opened (I usually come at least once or twice a week). My coworkers and I especially love the chicken gyro which is super juicy! Awesome tzatziki sauce and super friendly staff! A+++! :)"}
{"text":"I wish I tried this place sooner considering it is a block away from me. I found it from yelp (as usual) and decided to go in with my boyfriend on a chilly Friday night. We both got the Chicken Gyro Plates, which were exploding with food and flavour. We were in Greece this past summer, and were Gyro'd Out, you could say, but this place reignited our love for the food. The chicken was moist and plentiful, and the sides of Greek salad, potatoes, and rice were equally appetizing. When I imagine a gyro plate, this is exactly what I want to be eating. It's safe to say, we will be back."}
{"text":"In the fast food landscape of John Street, there are many competitive grab and go options. Even so, this restaurant has quickly emerged as a popular newcomer with many five star reviews under its belt. Curious and skeptical at heart, I gave it a try by ordering their most popular item: the chicken gyro.   These are my findings:  - Service: The staff members are extremely friendly and provide great conversation and effective, speedy service even when they are not the main worker tending to you. This was demonstrated by how many of the people who were ordering seemed to be regulars and were conversing in depth with the workers about various aspects of life.   - Price and Portion Size: The gyro wasn't small by any means and it was a perfect size for a hungry hippo during lunch.  With it being a little over 7 dollars after tax, its price to portion ratio is very comparable to food found outside of the downtown core and could even rival the discounted varieties on Mealpal.  - Flavour: Unlike what other Yelpers have stated, I personally didn't find the flavour to be uniquely better than other gyros.  It tasted great nonetheless.  The fries they stuffed inside were a bonus as well, albeit doing little to change the flavour palette.   Overall, there are only pros with this restaurant.  There isn't anything exceptional to write home about, but it's a solid choice for lunch on the go when you're zipping from place to place in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Was surprised to see no one in the place after I saw the Yelp reviews but my chicken gyro was delicious. Ordered it with hot sauce and it definitely was messy and had some kick but it was totally worth it. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Really cozy place. Small area to sit and eat. But they make up with their quality of food. Food is nothing but amazing! Has become my go to Gyro place. Their salad is flavourful. Their rice is amazing. Their potatoes pack flavour. There sauces are all on point. Go here every time I come to Toronto. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"OMG, Oh My Gyro is an excellent option for quick, cheap, saucy, delicious, and filling food.   I've stopped by for lunch a few times and always get their OMG Signature dish. You can get it in regular or large, but I'd definitely recommend just sticking with a regular as the portions are very generous. The OMG Signature comes with your choice of Fries, Garlic Potato, Rice, or Bulgar Rice with Chicken, Beef, Falafel. I'm also pretty sure you can mix and match. Everything is superb - would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing Gyro! So hard to find good quality places to eat when you are from out of town but this place was better than we expected. Almost as good as the gyro I had in Mykonos. We had to come back before leaving town because it was that good. I had the chicken/beef gyro and my sister in law had the chicken platter. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Omg Oh my Gyro is bomb.com. Although my hunger could be masking the glowing review I'm about to give I will say that everything is fresh and the staff are friendly. We ordered a gyro plate and a chicken pita wrap. The chicken is well seasoned and was freshly made to order. Total for both was ~$14. The shop had 5 seats so we opted to purchase a coffee at Starbucks next door and chow down. Their hot sauce is a treat for those who say hot sauce is never hot enough at these places as my tongue was on fire! The fries inside my pita were crispy and helped me get through the overwhelming heat of the hot sauce. They have an assortment of pops, as well as specialty juices.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Got the beef doner. The meat was juicy and really well cooked. The owner was kind enough to offer me a free upgrade and drink because it was my first time. Overall great value for money"}
{"text":"Toronto is becoming oversaturated with Gyro/Shawarma/Falafel joints however, this one stands out in this Queen west neighborhood.  Large portions at very reasonable prices, fresh toppings, deliciously tender chicken, fries could be a bit crispier, warm soft pita bread, very balanced ratio of meat to bread and toppings, nothing overpowering or too greasy. The meat is very well seasoned especially the beef..wow..the hot sauce is house made and a wonderful compliment. Friendly service, hits the spot, and I hope they continue to do well here."}
{"text":"I was passing by this place and saw people having big gyro sandwiches and plates. I got curious and was a bit hungry, so I got a mixed beef/chicken gyro sandwich, and I was very very full.   So far, this is the best gyro stop in Toronto, the servings are HUGE and the service was great!!"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from Omg Oh My Gyro through JustEat.  My fiance and I order a lot of Greek in the Village so we wanted to try something new.  As such, I cannot speak to the accessibility or gendered factors of their bathrooms.    Here's what I can tell you; I ordered food at 8PM.  JustEat's system said it would be delivered at 9PM.  At 8:50PM, I got a text informing me the food would be 10-15 minutes late.  I was annoyed, but there was nothing I could do.   When the food did finally arrive, closer to 9:20PM, it was just awful.  We ordered a chicken plate and it was inedible.  The food itself had become wet from the steam of other meals touching it.  And yet the chicken was cold.  The potatoes were soggy and cold.  Instead of packaging the sauce in containers, the employees decided to spread it all over the food, which made the sogginess even worse.    Even after reheating the food, it tasted bad.  The quality of the chicken felt very low, as it was stringy and greasy at the same time.  The feta on the greek salad tasted expired and the pita was stale.  It was so bad we had to throw it out and call JustEat for a refund.  I will not order from this place EVER again!"}
{"text":"Need a quick meal? Don't want to spend a lot? Feel Full for hours? This is the spot. Rice, Salad, Potatoes or Fries, Meat and tons of Garlic Sauce will keep you satisfied for hours.   I prefer the fries over the potatoes as they have a nice crispy coating. The meat is pretty good for what it is, and there's tons of flavor from the sauces. The spice also adds a great depth of flavor.   It kinda reminds me of a Jimmy the Greek but I love that it is family owned.   Keep Eating,  Angela"}
{"text":"Just tried it for the first time with the chicken gyro meal, and... OMG so good!  The sauce is crazy good.  No real seating inside."}
{"text":"I passed by this place during lunchtime, saw a line out the door and figured it was worth a try. I ordered the OMG Signature with chicken and garlic potatoes. It was alright. The portion is sufficient, the chicken is moist and the potatoes are very soft which I liked, however there wasn't much flavour. The dish was rather bland with the only flavour coming from the garlic sauce on top. I can see the appeal if you work in the area and want a quick, inexpensive take out option, but I probably wouldn't travel just to eat here."}
{"text":"Ordered Chicken Gyro Wrap for pick up today. It was good, chicken had a crunch and was juicy from inside. Fries in the wrap were amazing too. I am not a big fan of tomatoes in the wrap so next time I will get my wrap without tomatoes."}
{"text":"The chicken gyro is awesome. Not a fan of fries in my gyro so avoided it. Pita is moist, chicken is juicy and the sauces come together perfectly."}
{"text":"Their food is good, but they cannot handle rushes. I waited 30 minutes for my food and it was a chicken gyro platter. The meat is literally right there already cooked. There were also a number of frustrated delivery drivers because they were given wrong orders. It was very stressful and I won't go back, the food isn't worth it."}
{"text":"I would absolutely not blame you if you read this review with complete suspicion and mistrust, as this business has, as of this writing, three glowing reviews by individuals with no other reviews to their name. (Okay, one guy has a single other review.)  I walked into the place expecting to debunk this trio of obviously fake reviews, but having eaten my meal, I have no choice but to join their ranks.  I decided to keep it simple and order the chicken gyro pita, which comes topped with chicken, lettuce, tomato, French fries, onions, white sauce, and hot sauce. (I'd love to be more specific but the website does not contain a menu.)  Without resorting to hyperbole, I'll just say that I was absolutely floored by this thing. Everything about it worked; the bread had a nice char and smoky taste from the grill, the chicken was chock-a-block with those coveted crispy bits, and the two sauces worked perfectly together. About the only negative thing I can say is that the wrap did get a little messy towards the end (a bit too much sauce, perhaps?), but this is an extremely minor and forgivable issue.  And at just over $7 after tax, it's a hell of a deal. I'll definitely be returning to sample some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"Great Food to fill your craving that is quick and healthy!  Had a wonderful souvlaki pita with fries, and a lot of veggies. Everything felt very fresh and homemade. They have a great and smooth garlic sauce with an amazing homemade hot sauce that has a good kick.  Brand new opening with an amazing look that is fresh and clean.  The owners are great and very friendly!   Can't wait to come back and try out their dinner plates!  Have different meat options from: Shawarma Beef falafel Chicken breast souvlaki  With sides such as: Rice French fries Pita Potatoes"}
{"text":"Coming from New York and finding this place made me sooooooo happy! The food is so fresh and super delicious.. I had the chicken box and it was amazinggggggggg just look at the picture for yourself...no matter where you are I suggest you come try it..staff is also friendly and they have drinks from their country if you love trying new things  I had this yesterday and I'm on my way to get some more before we head back to New York, that's how good it was :)"}
{"text":"This is my favourite gyro place in the whole city ! I love the food and the managers are fantastic :)"}
{"text":"Got take out to bring to the Jays game. Got the chicken gyro wrap and asked for extra fries. I couldn't wait to eat the wrap while walking to the Rogers Centre because I was super hungry.   Once at the game quickly unwrapped the foil and started to chow down! First initial bites were very good, maybe because I was just starving and from all the walking made more extra hungry. But the chicken and all the ingredients in the wrap was really delicious. The chicken was moist, and juicy. Not dry. Also they gave a lot of chicken and fries together which made the wrap more tasty.   Funny moment was when I was eating my gyro with my cousin there were two girls behind us and talking amongst themselves but I could hear their conversation, which was they were talking about the gyro's we were eating haha. One asked the other, where did they get a gyro here?   The service was great, very friendly and you can request more condiments like fries or toppings you want more or less of in your wrap or plate. They are very accommodating to how you customize your food which is really nice of them.  The size of the wrap just may fool people that it looks small however it's very filling. Good size food item to bring to the game and it's good its wrapped in foil which makes eating cleaner and not having all the sauce run down your hands while trying to watch a game and getting all messy.   Need to come back again to try other item on their menu!"}
{"text":"Delicious beef doner with a Turkish speciality, sour cherry nectar. Hands down the best gyros and beef doner in this neck of the woods. Perfect for a quick grab if you're hanging out at Grange park."}
{"text":"I tried the beef doner wrap and was disappointed by the meat. Luckily, their white garlic sauce salvaged the blandness of their beef. My friend tried out the chicken gyro which was 10x more flavourful and I'd definitely be back for that.  Pro tip: make sure to eat this somewhere you don't mind getting dirty. It can be tricky and messy to eat (or I'm an idiot)."}
{"text":"A really tiny place with a few seats against the wall, most people come in for fast and take-out foods  Service: came there really late at night after a movie at Scotiabank Theatre nearby, and they were still open past their closing time at 10pm. Helpful and good service, no complain. They got my order wrong at first, but quickly apologized after I mentioned to them and corrected my order.  Food: we got their OMg Specials in size large, with 1 carb base (rice) and 1 protein (chicken). The portion was HUGEE! They filled the large container with rice and really generous amount of chicken (we asked for sauce on the side) - chicken tasted good, but nothing AMAZING. The portion is definitely enough for 2 people because we shared the box between 2 and still had leftovers! So come here if you are STARVING AND CAN EAT A WHOLE COW!  Overall: would return for when I have a huge appetite!"}
{"text":"Best Gyro in the city. Meat, pita, fries, sauces work so well together. My new go to spot."}
{"text":"Walked in with the wife a d was given a sample of the chicken, sold! Moist and tender with great flavor. I ended up with the chicken and the wife had the beef, just loved the both. The sauces are made in house as per the owner ( super nice guy) and they taste fantastic! The pepper sauce is more flavorful than hot and it's just great. Looking forward to going back soon."}
{"text":"OMGosh!! Fantastic Gyro place just opened absolutely modern design, spotless clean and 2 fine super-educated gentleman making the mist delicious take away. Easy to find right next to Starbucks on Queen W. They even make homemade hot sauce that had layers of heat - delicious! Enjoy."}
{"text":"So let me clear up a few misconceptions. 1) this is not gyro meat, it's shawarma. 2) this is basically take out only since there is no place to sit.    We got chicken, beef and falafel boxes. Chicken was the best tasting overall and then the beef. I would say the falafel are mediocre. The rice and salad taste great with their OMG sauce. They were flexible with substitutions and had very generous portions. For a take out fast food restaurant I give it 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is among my fav shawarma places in the city and a huge guilty pleasure. The meat is to die for, the potatoes are warm and crisp and the whole experience makes this a place you can't miss."}
{"text":"Cool and innovative space that serves up decently priced chicken or beef gyro. For just under $10 you can get a decently tasting lunch. There is a ton of rice with a moderate amount of meat and sauce. A little bit more meat would go a long way. Not bad."}
{"text":"I had a gyro here and good value for the dollar. The gyro was a good size and made fresh. The fries inside certainly make it filling. I found it didn't have a lot of flavour but did taste pretty good.  I had to ask for extra tzatziki to help out the blandness  The restaurant itself was very cold as they have the door propped wide open even on a cold day. Certainly not encouraging you to stay long at all! In general I'd say it's average at best. I won't avoid this place but I'm certainly in no rush to eat here again."}
{"text":"Excellent ! !! Un petit snack de 20h pour moi est devenu un festin pour ma conjointe et moi. Généreuse portion très abordable et savoureux. Petit local en retrait de la rue Queen à ne pas manquer."}
{"text":"Omg is RIGHT. Hungry and short for time; popped in- FANTASTIC. Perfect balance of everything- flavor, amount of veggies, amount of spice...  In transient Queen West, thus place should be a longer standing fixture.  Great service and fresh, delicious healthy food."}
{"text":"1 year later, still pretty good, though prices all went up again. Price for boxes/plates are stupid high. Recommend ordering from Feedback.  I have a hard time getting enough spicy sauce (its really not that spicy at all, what a joke) because they're so reluctant"}
{"text":"I quite like it here! Some pretty good and satisfying chicken gyros. I always end up going here to grab a bite to eat before I watch a movie at Scotiabank theatre. The original chicken gyro plus taxes will cost you about $8.95 and it's quite filling - I would say this is quite the deal. The chicken gyros comes with french fries in them, which I feel adds a really nice texture and taste to the gyro. For those of you who are worried about carbs, worry not, as they are really flexible and allow you to customize and replace the fries with more veggies if you prefer (e.g. cucumbers, lettuce, etc.). Definitely give this place a try. The employees are really friendly too."}
