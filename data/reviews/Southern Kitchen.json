{"text":"I got on to leave a review and have to say that I'm shocked about the negative reviews. My experiences have been completely different. My husband and I have been there twice now and both times the food has been hot and very good (and we got take out so there was plenty of time for things to get cold... they weren't)! The baked chicken is moist and delicious, if the macaroni and cheese came from a box (as one user suggested) they fooled me! The restaurant is clean and the people are SO friendly. We will continue eating here!"}
{"text":"Good southern food. The environment was a little loud and the space was very crammed but overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Good ol' Tennessee cookin. Guys are super nice! I got the BLT minus the B, with egg and fried green tomatoes. Took me back to Frankiln TN and my taste buds were loving it. Everyone in our group was super happy with what they got. I'll be finding them again soon :)"}
{"text":"I was so excited for this place to open up, but was very disappointed.  Instant mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese from a box with a layer of shredded cheese on top to make it look homemade, dried out chicken, etc.  Definitely not worth the price they charge for \"home cooked\" \"soul\" food."}
{"text":"Entrance was very dirty with garbage on ground. So hungry so went in anyway. Hamburger was awful, macaroni was cold, meatloaf mushy and salad was wilted an slimy. Lemonade not fresh. All hot sides in hotel pans in seating area and one was burning. I would love to see a restaurant in this location do well as it is such a great location for me."}
{"text":"Must try! The corn hushpuppies are AMAZING!!!  The BBQ Sammy w/ slaw, bomb shniggety!!!!!  Chef John makes his own pickles and makes them right...soooo good.  We found them parked out in front of Velveteen Rabbit, Downtown on Main, on a Saturday night. What a great pairing. Order food, and then go in for a yummy cocktail."}
{"text":"Came in for a short vacation and visited this restaurant that was nearby. The food is great! The mac and cheese, and yummy fried chicken was great. Of course going to the south I tried their sweet tea, and I was not disappointed. Overall the restaurant had a great atmosphere, and delicious southern home cooking."}
{"text":"Ultimate Mac and the Blackened catfish sandwich are amazing. Definitely recommend to anyone who likes southern food, and even to anyone who doesn't. You'll say to yourself \"Omg, I can't believe this came off of a food truck!\" Oh but it did, and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome truck...can't wait for brick and mortar location to open.  The Nash-Vegas Hit Chicken is the best in the West Coast!!!  House pimento is amazing!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Sweet tea and the best bacon Mac and cheese and lobster hush puppies. Do yourself a favor and check this food truck out. You will crave it like I do!"}
