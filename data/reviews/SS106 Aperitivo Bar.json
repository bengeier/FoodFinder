{"text":"Had a delicious plate of meatballs & tiramisu for dessert. Nice vibe and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Would have like to eaten at the restaurant as we had heard good reviews and the menu looked interesting however one table was so disruptive and loud it was very uncomfortable to be in the restaurant.  Unfortunately the staff and manager/owner turned a blind eye to the complaints of other diners. Too bad but we thoroughly enjoyed a meal at another restaurant close by."}

{"text":"A friend and I stopped in for a quick bite and drinks on a Friday night and were extremely impressed! We ordered the pork sausage and olives as appetizers and split a plate of gnocchi as our main and left feeling full and satisfied. The food was excellent and portions generous!  We both had cocktails and based solely on the Venetian Spritz I was drinking, I'd rate that as excellent too.   The service was on point that night as well. We were seated and served very quickly (the food was fast out of the kitchen) and our server was very diligent in checking in with us.   Overall a great experience and I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I would have easily come Aperitivo five stars for food only. Too bad the service was brutal.  Always had to interrupt her socializing with other staff and what appeared to be owners or at least regulars just to get water refilled.  Again, kudos to the kitchen.  The food was spectacular."}
{"text":"Great ambience.  Quality food and good drinks/wine menu.  Good service.  Great olives  Good pasta   This was my first first time at this restaurant. Have to visit again to experience a greater selection of the menu  will update in further detail then."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Real coffee food was quick and very tasty plus the home made ginger ale was excellent."}
{"text":"This place is really delicious, I went with a large group and the food, drinks, and desserts are all outstanding quality! The owner is very friendly and attentive, and the staff are great too. I found the atmosphere fun and energetic (not really for a quiet dinner) so just keep that in mind based on the kind of diner you are, I really enjoyed it."}
