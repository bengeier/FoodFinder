{"text":"Great food! The honey biscuits are amazing! Great service and great food. It's worth it and you get to support a local business which is always an extra plus."}
{"text":"I think they are highly priced for the portions that are served. I was not happy with the chicken boneless bites. My fiance had BBQ Pork, hot link, potato salad and greens. Meal cost $16.00 and was still hungry after."}
{"text":"Hmm, I tried to place an online order at 5 Star, which they offer, but they were out of 16 of the 23 items on the menu.   A successful restaurant has three things: good options, good service and good food. If you're out of 70% of your menu items, 6 hours before closing, you will not be successful."}
{"text":"Bryon is the owner and he's passionate about this food. The love comes through in every bite. The wings are always on point, crispy, and full of flavor. the Catfish is crispy and flavorful too. Good fries on the side, Potato Salad and Green (Made with Turkey) are good as well. Go check them out today and show some love."}
{"text":"Chicken was tasteless. Asked for utensils and there were none until the cook finally came with plastic ones. Eating area was dirty. In the kitchen there were dirty sneakers on a rack. Ribs and sauce also tasteless.  Don't recommend and wouldn't waste money there again."}
