{"text":"Looking for amazing cheesesteaks? This is the place to be! Philly's & Fries in Scottsdale has been one of the best cheesesteak experiences I've ever had. I have had plenty of cheesesteaks, including some from the east coast, and this place just about does it! Full of flavor and packed with ingredients. They do not cut you short on the amount, its very filling. Their ingredients come straight from Philly, so its authentic. The restaurant is extremely clean and the employees are respectful and show phenomenal customer service. Anything you need or ask for they comply. Prices are very affordable. It is definitely worth going to Philly's & Fries and I would recommend it to just about anyone. I am obsessed and can't get enough. The Hot & Spicy is one of my favorites, but all the cheesesteaks on their menu are amazing (I've tried them all)."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on Friday. This place is not only really delicious but its also affordable and portions are huge. The staff was so wonderful, attentive and polite."}
{"text":"This place is brand spankin new and amazing to say the least! I've spent years searching for a mouth watering philly cheesesteak spot in AZ only to be disappointed by the chains in the mall food court. But not anymore!! Phillys and Fries is heaven sent...thank you baby Jesus!! This was my 3rd visit in three days (pretty safe to say I'm addicted), and I have the pleasure of writing the first yelp review, after demanding the owner to create a yelp for it. It would be selfish of me not to spread the word about it. It's super clean, with friendly staff, and can't forget about the food. So far I have tried the traditional cheesesteak, the hot n spicy, and also the cheesesteak salad. All of which were amazing. You have an option of choosing steak or chicken on all items and many customizable options with veggies. And you MUST try the Buffalo Chicken Fries! The cheeksteaks are big and filling but I just couldnt resist on ordering the Buffalo Fries along with it every time. I substituted the blue cheese for ranch, and have been having wet dreams about them since. I'm already anticipating tomorrow's lunch and will continue to work my way down that menu!"}
{"text":"Simply, don't  waste your money. Tried  it on 3 separate  occasions  with the Groupon I bought, disappointed  each time."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, meat and toppings tasted good but were very dry, and the roll was cold and stale.  It wasn't busy at all so not sure why they couldn't take the time to make it better."}
{"text":"Average food, I was not wowed , a little bland. Will come back but it will not be on my short list of favorites."}
{"text":"Great Philly steaks! Would like the meat cooked not quite so dark but the flavor is good."}
{"text":"These guys must be from Philly..... Number one phot steak in the west coast. Very cheap prices Unbelievable quality  Everyone should try this place"}
{"text":"Great Service and Great Food!  Staff is awesome and definitely one of the best places to eat a Philly in town!"}
{"text":"Yummy philly's in scottsdale! I had the Philly cheese steak and it was so fresh and delicious..I finished it in a jiffy!my husband had the hot & spicy and he said it was good too. It had an extra kick to it. The must have are fries with different toppings... we got the Buffalo fries and they were crisp and nice. Must go for Philly lovers.."}
{"text":"amazing food!!!!! will come back for sure. Tried bbq and hot and spicy and would definitely recommend both :)"}
{"text":"CALLED FIRST, PHONE OUT OF SERVICE, I THINK THEY ARE CLOSED.  I saw the sign and after the last disastrous sandwich from Jersey Mikes up the road, I was looking for a reasonable cheesesteak.  First off, they have the right bread.  Amoroso's rolls wrap 90% of the hoagies and cheese steaks in Philly.  Cheese, regardless of what you may hear, provolone is the cheese of choice in Philly, NOT Cheesy Whizz.  So how close to the real deal?  Just a notch off.  I had a cheesesteak, wit. That's a regular cheesesteak with onions.   Grilled long enough to brown a little, cheese melted on top while still on the flattop.  Juicy, but not too greasy.  I think with a higher quality cheese and steak this could be a good as it gets.  If you are looking for a little extra flavor, spring for the extra meat."}
{"text":"I wasn't going to leave this post up, but screw it.  The people who work for this place are absolute jerks.  I went in with  my wife to pick up a 2 sandwich order, she went to the counter and I went to the restroom, it was after all there and open.  My wife paid for the order and as we walk out, he waves at me and thanks me for using the restroom?  Oh, he was being passive-aggressive, he thought I just went in to use the restroom, despite walking in with someone who just picked up a to-go order, I was really confused about the whole thing, I guess they are very protective of their bathroom, so tread lightly.  That being said, the food was ruined, because a place that treats is customers like crap by default will never have good food, what good is a sandwich if you get verbally assaulted by a hipster with a bun on top of this head?  No thanks guys, good luck with your business, but I would wait until you become a major chain before you start treating everybody like garbage."}
{"text":"I'm somewhat of a philly cheesesteak aficionado, so I keep pretty high standards on them. Anyone opening a philly cheesesteak place near the airpark has competition. Corleone's and Capriotti's both hold their own in this category. I didn't think Philly's & Fries was quite there yet. The sandwich was good, but no authentic philly cheesesteak. I'll give them a month to work out the kinks, then be back for another try!"}
{"text":"I am not sure where all these 5 star reviews are coming as they are far from deserved. I have had a philly at the major players in PA and I can say this has a long way to go. I got the philly with egg and whiz. The toppings where great but the meat was really bland. I thought this would happen when I saw the cook throwing frozen meat on the grill. Overall it's an okay sandwich but nothing special. The guy working the counter is fantastic and you can tell really likes working at the place. I wish I could rate higher as I love a good cheesesteak but it's hard to have a great product when it is frozen going onto the grill."}
{"text":"Minus one star!! --- Tried a new place...save your money & calories. The food had absolutely no flavor, sauce, or taste - it was an absolute disgrace to the Philadelphia Cheese Steak Sandwich. I bought and took home to my family, but when I called to tell the staff We were all very unhappy with the lack of taste.....They said that \"because I hadn't eaten the food at the restaurant, they wouldn't return my money\" - NOW that's horrible customer service for you. We even tried to add our own flavor to the sandwiches but couldn't fix the flat flavor failures.  Please avoid this place at all cost! There's lots of better options in the area."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from this new-ish establishment about a month ago. The restaurant is small with only a handful of tables and chairs, but it appeared to be clean. It took no more than 10 minutes for my food to be cooked and ready to take home.   The guy with the man bun was at the register, which caused me to hold back spurts of laughter, as I had just finished reading a very comical negative review about him by another Yelper. Man bun dude was not super friendly, but pleasant enough. He wasn't rude to me by any means.   I ordered a small Cheesesteak-n-egg sandwich and it tasted awesome! The sandwich was rather filling as it included steak, melted cheese, a large fried egg, a small handful of fries, and a dash of mayo. Whoever thought of that combination of flavors is a genius!   Now, I wish I could stop there and say I am a big fan of this establishment, but at this point I cannot. A few weeks ago, I attempted to order from them through Door Dash using the discount code listed on the Philly's and Fries website. I was so excited to finally try their delicious-sounding loaded fries, but was seriously let down when I discovered that Philly's and Fries is no longer partnered with Door Dash.   On my way home from the gym this evening, I decided to stop by Philly's and Fries for another round of takeout. My face fell as I walked up to the storefront and noticed that all of the lights were turned off and the door was locked. I glanced at my phone to check the time and it was only 7:40. According to the hours listed on their website, Yelp, and the front door, they should have been open until 8 PM. I sighed and reluctantly walked away towards another establishment nearby.   So, what is the deal with this place? If they for whatever reason needed to close up early tonight, the least they could have done is tape a note on the door apologizing for the inconvenience. If 8 PM is no longer their standard closing time, then they need to update that on all platforms ASAP.   I am debating whether or not I should attempt to eat here again. I enjoyed the food, but if their hours continue to be inconsistent, then clearly they do not want my business. Time to get it together guys!"}
{"text":"Staff was great philly had barely any meat to bread ratio thus no flavor fries and onion rings were of good quality but grease had not been changed basically ruining everything, wish I would have got the steak n cheese from subway any subway"}
{"text":"Amazing Philly sandwich!  Lot of food for your money. Great place, very clean and cool staff. I got to watch the NHL all-star while eating. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"After so many times of passing this place daily, I finally stopped by for dinner, I LOVE IT!  The young man at the counter was so helpful, and so I went with his fav sub which is the The cheesesteak-n- egg!! So yummy!!!!  Downside was they don't sell Coke, and I won't drink Pepsi. So I walked over to rubios for one."}
