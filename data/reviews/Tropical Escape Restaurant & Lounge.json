{"text":"The people here are very nice. It is invariably busy whatever time of day so be prepared to wait. It is really worth it and priced VERY well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"It seems every time I try to enter this place, the door is always locked because I guess someone working there is on a break somewhere not in the restaurant or something like that...Wtf? And it's not like I'm trying at 4 am, I go in the afternoon/evening and it seems nobody is in there. I just want to check out the menu and order something to-go. So far this place gets 1 star, open your fucking doors, this is how you lose customers. Perhaps I should forget about trying their food and stick with Carribean Heat."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!   Great atmosphere and friendly people! They have great westindian Chinese food and westindian dishes!  Beers are cheap and they have tray specials.  Some times they have a dj there and the party is really happening!"}
