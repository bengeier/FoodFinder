{"text":"I went to beyond donuts &cafe for the first time today and not knowing what they had I tried called 4 time from 12pm to 2pm to find out if they had a menu on line. I went ahead and went up there since no one was answering the phone only to find the placed closed. The doors were locked and no one was to be seen in the store. There were donuts on the display case and no sign on the door saying why they were closed. This was a horrible I wanted to try this place because I have heard good things about it and we'll I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in as my cars in the shop. Not much from the outside (typical strip mall suite), but WOW these are some good donuts! Had an old fashioned and it was perfect. Also had an egg bacon bagel. Perfect and very big. Friendly staff to boot. 

If your on the fence, give this joint a shot. Worth it."}
{"text":"I Drive from Surprise to Union hills and the 101 to get donuts from the shop. These guys are the best! And always served up with a smile. Their apple fritters will blow your mind. If that's not your taste you gotta try the red velvet donut or the blueberry donut unbelievable. It's tucked away in the corner of a strip mall just north  of the Walmart but absolutely well worth the stop."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now, and both times were wonderful! The burritos are delicious, and large enough to share, and the donuts are amazing!"}
{"text":"Friendly family donut shop. Love this place. It is my \"go to\" shop for picking up donuts. Can't beat the prices. My family also enjoys the breakfast sandwiches they make fresh when you order. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a breakfast burrito! However, I also got a donut and it was amazing, nothing better than a homemade donut. Definitely a place you have to try if you have a sweet tooth in the morning."}
{"text":"Donuts are delicious, would've given five stars but they were an hour late for delivery. Other than that, positive experience."}
{"text":"I've only been to this donut shop a few times now, but every time has been a great experience. The donuts have always been super fresh, and incredibly tasty. Also, the staff are super friendly, and offer excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! We go here almost every Saturday as a family to get the best donuts in town! All the girls who work here are super nice and friendly. Great atmosphere! You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First time here and very impressed. The service was friendly, quick, and informative. Between two of us we tried their donuts, breakfast bagel sandwiches, and drinks. 

In addition their prices are perfect for their menu. Our total cost for all the above less than $18.00!

Their glazed, buttermilk bar, and peanut & chocolate cake donuts were fresh & delicious!

The breakfast bagels with cheese, eggs, and bacon were on large, fresh, and soft bagels. Also, unlike some bagel places in town, the egg (flavorful & fluffy) & bacon part of your breakfast bagel is proportionate to the size of the bagel. Love that!

Our drinks were tasty! The hot chocolate was hot & \"chocolaty.\" The Thai tea was delicious! I wasn't sure what to expect as it was an orange colored drink. I found out that the tea leaves used for this drink are orange in color and when added to the 1/2 & 1/2 it turns an interesting orange color. 

Not a big place nor an extensive menu. However, what they do have is fantastic. Next time we will try their array of breakfast burritos. 

Great family run business! We will definitely be back... often!"}
{"text":"Donuts and burritos are amazing! Tucked away from the street. People are super warm and friendly. Hawaiian coffee is crazy delicious l!"}
{"text":"I didn't think I could find a better donut than Bosa--but I did, and it's in the West Valley.  The business is set back into a strip mall (signage isn't great) on the north side of Union Hills across from WalMart.  - Note that they also have sandwiches and other meals.  The day we were there the special was ravioli.  -- This may be a dangerous find. . . ."}
{"text":"This place has fabulous donuts but don't leave without buying a Tiger Tail.  It is heavenly goodness and feeds a  family of four!!!"}
{"text":"Came in to pick up some donuts for the office.  Friendly service, good food and a nice selection.  Office staff thought the donuts were much better than most of your larger chains.  They did not have any weird combinations or off the wall flavors like some other places we have seen but then again I prefer the \"old fashioned\" donuts."}
{"text":"Good varieties of yeast and cake donuts. The price is very good and awesome service. Size of some the donuts are huge. Overall it's good place to come."}
{"text":"Not as many fancy donuts, but that is OK because the donuts they do have were above average delicious. The breakfast burrito was good and the Thai tea Boba was also yummy. Fast and easy service. Will be our go to donut shop"}
{"text":"Welp, there is officially a quaint deli/donut shop near my house! Thank goodness! Prior to this, the only option was Einstein's or Starbucks...blah! I had a most excellent breakfast burrito with egg, bacon, sausage, potato, and cheese.  And since this is a donut shop, I tried a chocolate cake donut, which was fantastic!

To top off the great food, the employees were super friendly and pleasant.  I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Great donuts and breakfast burritos.  The only complaint...if I had to say anything, was that the green salsa that came with the burrito was gelatinous in texture...I used one we had at home instead...other than that all the important stuff was delish!  We got a 1/2 dozen donuts, and 4 breakfast burritos after a long hike. Must try if you are in the neighborhod."}
{"text":"I think I eat here too often. :( Their breakfast burrito, the American Burrito, is my absolute favorite. Fast friendly service from all of the members on staff. They are hard-working people so please abide by their rules and don't take advantage of their kindness. If you were smart you wouldn't either. Rule #1, always treat the people who is making your food with extra kindness. This golden rule applies everywhere. 

And their donuts are great! They purposely make small batches so the quality of the donuts are top notch. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place.  Great breakfast and lunch items.  This is my fave spot to grab a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Stopped here after checking out restaurants on yelp close by. Great prices and good selections. Staff super friendly and helpful. They also have a large selection of other breakfast options besides donuts such as burritos and sandwiches. I didn't try their coffee this time but will next time I stop here. 

I encourage people to stop here to support a local mom and pop business and eat a good donut."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST Donut shop in Phoenix. It is a hidden gem and best of all It Is Family run. Dad makes all the Donuts and Mom and the Family all run the counter and dining room. They will make almost anything on special order. All their food is awesome and the apple fritters are out of this world. You gotta give this place a try. I go there Sunday morning and bring my clasic car and meet up with friends. We all rave about this place and the nice Family running it."}
{"text":"This is one of the best donuts places ever!!  My husband is a apple fritter freak -- he says these are the  best he has ever had!  I absolutely love the crumb donut, so soft and chewy.  So amazingly delicious!  

Cant wait to try more of their items -- burritos and sandwiches.  We will be regulars here for sure!!  The staff is also very nice and helpful!"}
{"text":"First time customer, but I will be back! Donuts are absolutely delicious and fresh! We tried a blueberry cake donut and a chocolate frosted with sprinkles, and my daughter declared it the best donut she's ever had. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Amazing donuts!!! Location is hidden, but once you know they're here, you'll be coming back! First time here, so I tried a chocolate raised and my husband had a glazed raised. He said it was as good or better than Krispy Kreme! Mine was so light and fluffy...soooo fresh!"}
{"text":"The donuts are delicious and fresh - SO far above the \"other\" donut shop.  The people are also very friendly. This is definitely a win/win.  Will definitely be back, and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"My boyfriend is from CA and extremely picky about his donuts. Beyond Donuts is his absolute favorite! We drive all the way from Scottsdale to get his fix."}
{"text":"Two stars for cleanliness and the burrito. However, donuts were greasy and the four different types of muffins on the menu are \"special order\" only. Really? I can call and order one muffin? That's efficient. 

Run a debit card and they'll add $.50 to your total. No fountain drinks. Canned soda (weird) and bottled juices. Eclair is spelled wrong on the menu. And they were nowhere to be found either. 

Icing on the cake for me was the Jesus music. Great if that's what you want to listen to, but not everyone wants to hear that. 

No chance of a return visit. No idea how they have the ratings they do."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite breakfast places around the area. They have fresh bagels and croissants that you can build your own style of breakfast sandwich. I get the bagel sandwich with eggs, bacon, cheese, with cream cheese, and topped with avocado, tomatoes, and onions. Amazing! You can get croissant sandwiches for lunch and breakfast. I haven't even mentioned there delicious donuts. Freshly made every day. Fruity pebbles donut - you can't go wrong. 
It's a bit tucked away in the arrowhead grill plaza. So it is kind of hidden, but once you find this gem it is amazing. We come at least once or twice a week. 
Awesome service and friendly faces. Love this place. Check it out."}
{"text":"Greasy donuts. Enough said. Two stars because the young lady behind the counter was friendly. Shop didn't have that fresh baked donut smell either. Won't be back. Better off getting donuts at Fry's."}
{"text":"Literally the best donuts I've ever had! (Even better than Krispy Kreme) The family who owns it is so nice every time I walk through the doors. I work next door from there & let me tell you, it's dangerous! I had to cut back because I was getting donuts almost every day at one point, they're addicting!"}
{"text":"Delicious cake donuts. Amazing Apple fritters. The small location is owned by a very nice family. Try the croissant sandwiches. So happy this place has joined the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Very tasty doughnuts and breakfast burritos. If you order coffee the creamer is in the refrigerator in the dining area- just fyi."}
{"text":"This place has beyond amazing donuts! Best in the valley that I have ever had. Beats out the Boss and the Rainbow even. Had the sprinkle chocolate and cinnamon bun glazed. Both very gooey, soft and full of wonderful flavor. I am glad I found a new donut shop for my every once in a while treat for the family."}
{"text":"Stopped by here at 0800 this morning. Not the friendliest staff, no good morning greetings or smiles. Ordered 3 cake donuts, two sausage egg and cheese bagel sandwiches and a large coffee. Sipped some coffee on the way home, decent stuff but not great. Got home to find two soggy  croissant sandwiches rather than bagel. They tasted ok other than steaming themselves in the aluminum foil wrappers. The cake donuts were the best I have had in the valley. Suggestions:
1. Show some enthusiasm towards customers.
2. Get the order correct.
3. Stop wrapping hot foods in foil unless customers like soggy bread.
4. When I add a tip to the jar at least you can say thank you."}
{"text":"New to the area... couldn't find a good burrito spot or doughnut joint. Found this little secluded place on yelp and never looked back. Always friendly... family owned... never up charging me for salsa! Will keep coming back! Tell anyone living in the arrowhead area!"}
{"text":"AMAZING DONUTS!!!  I had never been here but decided to give it a try last Saturday based on the Yelp reviews.  Boy am I glad I did!  These are now tied with Bosa as my favorite donuts!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Still the best donuts. I usually stop in 3-4 times a week. All the gals (guys too) are great!"}
{"text":"Amazing family owned place with FRESH donuts made each morning and other breakfast goodies!"}
{"text":"Despite its uninspiring ambient decor and less than appealing location, these are the best donuts in AZ hands down. Just as good as Oh Face Donuts in Vegas, and that is a tall order. Light, fluffy, quality ingredients and truly angelic taste. I hope continued success for a quality, local business in a sea of chain restaurant sameness. Come on people, abandon your Dunkin sameness and rush here. You won't regret it. Btw had a raspberry filled and red velvet cake. New sunday tradition!"}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend are visiting from California. We were trying to find a place for breakfast and found this place on yelp. Great little shop. Owner was extremely friendly. Gave us a free donut as well. Must try breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Beyond donuts is beyond amazing. They've got a wide yet fresh selection of donuts. The family that owns and operates it are some of the nicest people I've met. 
You want to get here early because what they make in the morning is what they have for the day. They're fresh and hot and amazing. 
The breakfast sandwiches and burritos are huge and we'll worth the money. They're simply amazing. I'd give this place 10 stars if it was possible."}
{"text":"Doughnuts here are CHEAP price wise, but taste like a million dollars in your mouth! These are some of the best doughnuts I've ever had and I'm a major doughnut connoisseur, I take doughnuts very seriously. The doughnuts are delicious, the cake doughnuts have just the right amount of a slight crisp on the outside and soft, fluffy, moist and fresh inside, the raised doughnuts are just right as well and their fritters are amazing. I wish I had the chance to try one of their supposedly delicious breakfast burritos but... I just see the doughnuts and lose hard! 

Excellent customer service too, the folks who run the place are super sweet people. 

A+++++, can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Pillows of heaven is how we describe the magic that is created daily here - specifically the classic raised, glazed donuts and holes. Fluffly, light heaven! Every other donut is amazing as well and so are the cafe menu options. Solid place for a rounded breakfast or lunch. Staff is awesome, super friendly and helpful. Family business in the best way possible!! So happy they're here"}
{"text":"Wandered into this place on accident and found the best donuts  we've had in years!  Their sandwiches were outstanding too.  Very fresh and tasty.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome little shop! Excellent donuts, pastries. The fritters are huge! Breakfast burritos and sandwiches  are on point, the croissants are perectly flaky. We will be returning here often!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and great tasting donuts! I prefer to come here instead of Dunkin Donuts since they have s better variety available and a friendly staff."}
{"text":"Heard of this place through a friend so decided to check it out. I love donuts!! Right when you walk in the smell takes you over. The donuts were wonderful. Even two days later the donuts were still soft and tasty. 

They have a maple long john donut with a strip of bacon on top 

Definitely try their custard filled donuts and old fashioned, so good!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I come here every chance we get. They have a wide selection of great donuts, and a great menu of lunch and breakfast sandwiches too! Locally owned and operated,  you are always warmly welcomed and appreciated here! Daily specials and fair prices with large portions make the journey complete!  See you next time!"}
{"text":"Best. Donut. Ever. Period. Exclamation point. Try the tiger tail donut! My all time favorite donut! 

Overall This place has become a frequent breakfast stop for the whole family. They have an awesome breakfast burrito that my wife and I share called the American (bacon, egg, cheese, potatoes, sausage), it won't fail to impress! We drive past three donut shops just to get to this one, well worth it! Owned by a very Friendly family, can't say enough good things about this place 

Try it, support a locally owned donut shop, you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Love their Boston creme! Donuts look unique and taste great. They have your basic breakfast sandwiches (no variety in bagels). Loved the croissant egg sandwich (croissant was huge!!) Definitely go there to get your donuts! Yum!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to get some thai tea right by my work! I also had their croissant sandwich with avocado which was bomb. The girls that work there are really nice and sweet!"}
{"text":"Best doughnut shop on this side of town!!! Staff is very friendly, love that it's family owned :)"}
{"text":"We have stopped by 2X's in the last week. Had a breakfast burrito....was really good. Donuts are also great...and good coffee. Off of Union Hills, just off 101...Sunday's they have car show from 6-10 am. We recommend highly...friendly owners and clean as can be. All good!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Highly recommend the glazed buttermilk donutes!  They have never disappointed me."}
{"text":"Happy to see a few of my favorite donuts here! The cake donuts taste super fresh and we got to try some fun flavors like a Fruity Pebbles donut! Very inexpensive! I was expecting to pay a lot more especially for their novelty donuts but I am not complaining! :)"}
{"text":"Best donut shop and cafe my wife and I have been to! Young lady that greeted us was a sweetheart, Complemented my Bob Ross shirt! The donuts are amazing, best maple donut around. Now let's talk about the breakfast croissant sandwich! UNREAL! First time coming here but I will 100% make this my breakfast joint"}
{"text":"Brand new place. Only a week and a half old! The menu is simple, but the food is delicious. I had a strawberry glazed donut with sprinkles, which was really good and fresh. Not dry or stale. But my favorite part was the ham, cheese, and jalapeño croissant! Yum! I'll be craving one of those every day! The proprietor is very kind. I'll definitely be visiting again, soon!"}
{"text":"Clean, friendly and the donuts were really good.  I found this place tucked away in a strip mall when I was at the Doctor's office nearby.  They have breakfast sandwiches and burritos as well, I will try one of those next time!"}
{"text":"Our favorite weekend breakfast place in the area! The breakfast sandwiches are always super fresh and the doughnuts melt in your mouth! A must try cafe !!"}
{"text":"Best donuts and chorizo burritos around! Found this place about a month ago and have gone back at least twice a week! Reasonable prices too!!"}
{"text":"Just a really great donut shop. Lots of options to choose from. Plus some yummy drinks as well."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to beyond donuts. The first was just for a quick cup of coffee, so I didn't have much to say. This morning, we came in to get some breakfast. We were pretty surprised how great the food was! We had a donut, a bagel sandwich, and a breakfast burrito. 

The sandwich and burrito were HUGE! The bagel was practically the same size as my husband's huge man hands. We got one that came with eggs, cheese, sausage and bacon. Very filling! The eggs seemed like maybe poured/liquid eggs but they were cooked well and didn't have that fake taste like poured eggs usually do. 

The burrito was really tasty, and I loved that it was not at all greasy. If I had to pick something to critique, I wish the potatoes had been crispy (they're more like just blanched), but they were still tasty. 

Service was super friendly and fast. I think they heard me mention it was warm in the seating area - I wasn't complaining, more of just an observation- but minutes later the AC came on :-) that was nice. Staff was hustling to keep coffee brewed and make sure no one had to wait long. 

Overall, a surprisingly good find in this little corner of Peoria!"}
{"text":"Really good donuts!  Good coffee nice lounge area haven't tried there food yet but it looks good owners are really sweet and try there red filled donuts!"}
{"text":"Had a thai tea and a few donuts. All were really yummy and I want to come back to try a burrito. The staff was friendly and the place was clean and warm on a rainy day."}
{"text":"A hole in the wall secret place! I stumbled upon this café. Family owned: mother, father, daughter and son. They are always pleasant, smiling and so friendly. Their donuts, coffee and sandwiches are ALWAYS fresh. Prices are super appropriate. Service superb! The croissant ham and cheese sandwich that Justin (son) makes is warm and the croissant crispy--how does he do it? The coffee cold or hot is fresh and strong. The donuts (any of them) are always pillowy soft and oh so fresh. Must go place!"}
{"text":"I'be been here twice now and love the people and the product. Pastry is beautiful and by far the best I have had in the valley. Highly recommended you visit soon and promise you won't be disappointed. I'm so certain you will love it that I will soon be carrying there product in my shop. 5 Stars For Sure!"}
{"text":"Girls that work here are very rude. Donuts are ok, this used to be our go to place but after multiple dirty looks and comments we have decided to take our business else where. Otherwise like I said it's a decent donut place they have plenty of variety and even serve burritos and sandwiches."}
{"text":"do they not have bagels tho srsl

their breakfast sandwiches are so good though and their iced coffee is what got me hooked on coffee to begin with. 

The place is always filled with people because the food and atmosphere is so great and so id recommend calling ahead to put in ur order. 

They have great prices and the portions are beautiful. Only donut/coffee place i come to"}
{"text":"Bed, Bath, and Beyond Donuts and Cafe.

This place is good. Three stars perfectly summarizes the experience I had, which is not bad!
My buddy Kurt and I came here for a swig of coffee and a little bit of old fashioned American-style conversation. 

I opted for a classic, blue-blood, American-style, good ol' apple fritter and a hot, steaming, toasty, robust cup of Hawaiian Hazelnut coffee. The taste factor on both items was medium-high. Exceeded expectations, which were admittedly not high (based on the aesthetic of the store). 

Kurt and I both enjoyed some thick, frothy conversation about the weather and leadership principles. The music in the place was an eclectic mix of early/mid 2000's indie. Pleasant!

Can't say I would go out of my way to come back, but would surely stop in on a lazy afternoon with some time to kill."}
{"text":"Omg....how did I miss a doughnut shop in my area.  They've been open since December. 
Yummy doughnuts.  Reminds me of Rainbow doughnuts.  They serve breakfast sandwiches and lunch too.
I'm not a Duncan or LaMar fan.  These taste much better.
The place is clean and neat and staff is friendly.
Definitely try them!"}
{"text":"Always kind and friendly, however as of lately, they have had several items in their menu not be available due to lack of ingredients. Certain bagels were not available on visit, the next two consecutive visits they didn't have the lunch meats or veggies for two sandwiches we wanted to order. We certainly love this location and their food, and would love for it to be stocked up for their lunch menu."}
{"text":"Great little family owned donut shop, made fresh everyday. The staff is all family and if you are not pleased or have a question, just ask. They are there to satisfy you.
The owner has been baking for years and his hard work and experience are in his products. They also make burritos and there are several to choose from that are really good. If you want fresh ingredients at nice mom & pop, this is the place."}
{"text":"The doughnuts are so delicious and the prices are amazing. It is a small family owned business and I will be more than happy to return to support them. They will fill donuts for you if they don't have to kind you are looking for. The Apple fritter was delicious and my friend loved the Boston filled chocolate donuts!"}
{"text":"Oh my YUM ! This place is so delicious. Went here with my bf and we ordered a giant breakfast burrito  for him and breakfast bagel for me and one blueberry cake donut to share. The bill was very cheap for all the food we got and very delicious.

The bagel on my sandwich was so soft and fluffy like clouds of heaven in my mouth. 

Instant fan and can't wait to go back here for breakfast again!"}
{"text":"The blueberry cake donut is perfect. It goes great with black coffee because it's super sweet. They have many other wonderful types of donuts but blueberry is my favorite. 
My kids like the donut holes, raised and glazed. The bagels are yummy but it's hard to resist the donuts."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places to get breakfast in Az. I tried it last week for the doughnuts and was so amazed at how good the pumpkin ones were I bought a varied dozen. Then I went back to try the breakfast burritos ... they did not disappoint. Seriously so good! They can do no wrong!!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! We've been four or five times over the last six-ish months to get breakfast burritos/sandwiches and doughnuts and have never been disappointed. We don't go out for breakfast often and every time we go here I can't believe I forgot how awesome the doughnuts are! It appears to be family owned and run. I overheard one girl say her dad makes the doughnuts every morning and if you come in early, you can get them when they're still warm. :) The customer service has always been very good. I usually hear them chatting with the regular customers - It's really nice."}
{"text":"Amazing! First time I have been here, there was a cute older couple who frequent there and able to give advice on best time to come! The service was friendly and made me feel like I was back in hawaii in a hole in the wall family owned bakery. Not only do the donuts look amazing but when I got them home they were all so delicious!!!!! Not dry like most donut places. The glaze on donuts thick and delicious - not thin and cheap - tasteless. This place gets 10 stars from me! We will be back again"}
{"text":"Not bad, I'd go back though, but not because of the donuts. The one I got was a bit soggy, but I'd give it another try. The main reason I go back is because for the breakfast burrito. The chorizo burrito was really good and I'd get that again. Now if the donuts got a little better I'd give it more stars."}
{"text":"Best donuts in the valley.  Apple fritters are especially good, and my co-workers request them on my way to work.  They are family owned and everyone is really friendly.  Highly recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"Nice small shop with delicious, fresh donuts. Even when I show up in the afternoon (between 1-2p), they still have a good selection left. Their glazed buttermilk bars are fabulous! A must-get item whenever I see them in the case. 

The people are very nice and shop is always clean. They do have tables if you want to eat in. They also offer some breakfast items and sandwiches, but I haven't tried them so can't comment on those. So glad to see great donut shops popping up on the west side. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time because of the reviews on Yelp. Ended up very disappointed. I think the extra charge to use a card is unwarranted. The food was average. Customer service was a bit unfriendly."}
{"text":"Their donuts are really good! I brought these donuts into the office twice and they're gone in less than an hour! Way better than any Dunkin donuts or your retail grocery store. Their thai tea is delicious, real authentic fresh brewed tea! There's nothing i love more than to support local businesses in the valley with good food!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Hard to see as they do not have a lot of signage letting you no they are here. Amazing donuts! For sure one of the very best in Arizona. Awesome customer service, if you get a chance you must stop by if you love donuts!"}
{"text":"Came here around 9:30am to pick up donuts for the kids I was watching.  I bought a dozen so it was everything.  All the donuts were good.  I ordered the breakfast burritos too.  YUM!  The burritos were HUGE!!!  Plus the breakfast sandwich was good...  Staff was super helpful!"}
{"text":"Great little family own donut parlor. Donuts are always so fresh in the morning, like it literally came out of the oven. I've sampled several donut places around the valley yet I find myself here again and again. Granted, it could be the friendly faces of the family that owns the place. Every single one has given outstanding service with a smile, and nowadays that is hard to come by."}
{"text":"After reading such great reviews on Yelp, I knew I had to check out this restaurant.  I ordered a German chocolate cake donut and a strawberry banana smoothly.  Both were delicious.  I was thrilled to see that they also offered breakfast sandwiches.  Service was great. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Best donuts you will ever have!  We stumbled onto this place a few months ago, and we are now regulars.  The young ladies at the counter are extremely pleasant as well."}
{"text":"The donuts are very good and the service is fast when u just get donuts. There's nothing special about the donuts, The long johns are very soft and air like, not heavy dough. The cake like donuts are great. I especially like the blueberry. I tried the pumpkin and it's more spice than pumpkin. I will not order it again and I love pumpkin. Threw it away.  I ordered a burrito for the first time and it took a long time to get. I ordered the desperado which was a chorizo  burrito. It was good, too many potatoes so maybe order light potato. Don't eat the salsa, it was definitely from a jar at the grocery store. If I get something besides donuts I would try a different burrito or breakfast sandwich that is American and not Mexican. I don't know why this merchant doesn't get blue pay so they can accept American Express. They had to put a big register by the register to say they don't. Obviously people like me try to pay with their American Express often for such an obnoxious sign to appear."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a strip mall with simple but delicious fresh donuts. I'm always looking for good coffee spots and this one is very nice. Cozy place to sit and have your food if you choose. Friend stated how nice and clean the bathroom  was. Next visit I will try the sandwiches based on reviews from fellow yelpers."}
{"text":"They are definitely better then DD but I'm still in love with Krispy Kreme I am in love with the blueberry cake donuts though they used to be my favorite when I was a kid and now I can never find them anywhere until now."}
{"text":"Tiger's tail is as good as it gets. Enough said. Try it and you will be a returning customer"}
{"text":"The donuts are delicioussssss!! Just your simple, staple donuts done right. The donuts are light and not heavy. Fried sugary pieces of perfection. Def recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"Beyond Donuts is a great little family run donut and breakfast burrito/sandwich spot just off the 101 and Union Hills. 

Their donuts sell out quick most days, but especially on the weekends but fear not; they can whip up plenty of egg, cheese and various breakfast meat concoctions any time of day. 

To quench your thirst, they have plenty of coffee and fresh brewed green and black and Thai teas with Boba options Fri, Sat, and Sun. 

Today's selection included a Red Velvet raised donut, Sausage, Potato Egg and Cheese Burrito, and a Ham, Egg, Cheese, Pepper and Onion Burrito. All made custom to order but worth the wait. Hearty portions and fresh ingredients paired with a great value make his local business a can't miss!"}
{"text":"I love this place but don't want you to go here, because I don't want my favorite donuts to run out!
Their donuts are fresh and warm and sweet and everything you could want. Go get one."}
{"text":"I haven't reviewed many places before but I had to for beyond donuts! We ordered 5 dozen for our sons birthday party and they were a big hit! They were so tasty, super soft, light and could tell freshly baked while ready on time. This mom&pop place was so friendly they made me want to come back to try the breakfast burritos. They were pretty dang tasty as well. Check this place out! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Beyond Donuts since the beginning and can I just say, they are AMAZING!! The food, the service, the cleanliness! They recently started making peach ice teas (my favorite) and I'm hooked! Beyond Donuts never fail me because their donuts are made fresh on the daily. I also get the desperado burrito which is also really good. It has been so wonderful seeing this business grow. I am a forever customer. They now have more selections for donuts! I love that they have a Facebook page because they keep you posted when they sell out for the day. So make sure you come in early if you're craving fresh donuts!!"}
{"text":"Such a nice breakfast/coffee stop. I enjoyed ice coffee. 1 kid enjoyed a breakfast burrito. Other kid enjoyed donuts. They serve breakfast all day which is a plus. Super nice staff :)"}
{"text":"Was looking for coffee cake and this place came up in the search. I have found the replacement for Krispy Kreme donuts and it's here! Glazed donut as well as all of the rise donuts have great texture and flavor. (Also had the crumb donut ) Sweet, but not too sweet. The cake donuts were a little too crisp for my liking, but still a good donut. 

Definitely taking the child when she gets back from school."}
{"text":"Not the largest selection, and most donuts aren't very fresh at 4:30pm on a Saturday. But.....very nice staff, and we enjoyed the ambiance."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints!! I'm never quite sure how I walk out with a soda, a huge twist doughnut, and 2 bagel sandwiches for under $10. And it all tastes delicious! You wouldn't expect a small donut place like this to have such good sandwiches and burritos but they definitely do. And I've never had the even slightest bad customer service! Always so sweet and talkative :)"}
{"text":"Today was our first visit. We had a breakfast burrito, bagel, and a donut. All the food was delicious!  It could not have been any better. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Me and my wife came to AZ on vacation and stopped her for breakfast twice! We tried the tiger tail donut. We tried a bagel breakfast sandwich and on the second visit, a croissant breakfast sandwich. Both of the sandwiches were delicious but we liked the bagel the most, its was softer than I expected! We tried a few more donuts but the tiger tail reigned supreme, I don't think any other donut was liked as much as the tiger tail. Customer service was awesome, while we were eating our food we could hear and see everyone that came in received great service as well. On my next trip back I will definitely try a breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Fantastic iced mocha. We also ordered the tigers tail, you can share it it's pretty big. And we got a ham, bacon, and cheese croissant sandwich. Both of these were amazing. Their donuts are cheaper than Dunkin and they are bigger. Definitely stop by it's a cute mom and pop shop."}
{"text":"Fabulous donuts !! Light and fluffy and not bogged down with grease. Easily the best donuts in the valley."}
{"text":"This place is beyond ridiculous! The best maple bars I've ever had in my entire life. Always a friendly girl behind the counter. Amazing donuts. Please go there. You deserve it"}
{"text":"Yummm!! I accidentally stumbled upon this donut shop and I'm so glad we did! Donuts are fresh and some of the best I've had. Very affordable and friendly staff. We will be back again."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  We decided to try some place new & are we glad we did. We each had a sandwich on a homemade croissant, ham & cheese and a BLT. Oh my, were they ever good. We brought home some donuts. YUM.  The best buttermilk bar I have ever eaten.  You must try this place. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick, but delicious breakfast to go since we had just come from camping/hiking and didn't want a sit down place since we had our dog with us. Ordered a breakfast bagel (egg, bacon, cheese, avocado) and it was good and filling. The chocolate long John donut was JUST as everyone comments - delicious, fresh! The hazelnut coffee tastes good, I did a split of hazelnut/regular and it wasn't strong enough for my liking. 
Definitely recommend this place! So sad that it doesn't exist in my home town!!"}
{"text":"Fourth time coming here and it is constantly great service and donuts. I really like the burritos! The kids loved the donut holes! Clean and friendly environment."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. I LOVE local shops. This place has incredible customer service and great music. Plus it smells delicious. We got here and they didn't have a huge selection left, probably because it was noon on a Saturday. I asked if they had any sprinkle donuts left (maybe in the back) and the sweet girl said \"no we don't but if you like cake donuts I can add chocolate, strawberry, or vanilla, to this with sprinkles on top\" and she made it just for us. It was so sweet. The donuts are amazing. This place is awesome"}
{"text":"Tried this place out really nice service. Good food. Will be coming back. We got the breakfast sandwich and donuts"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this little shop! I brought my energetic son and was able to find a calm place to get a tasty breakfast. The friendly service made this very affordable visit a welcome start to my day."}
{"text":"Love to stop at this place in the mornings before my grind. Great customer service and the food is great for what you pay for."}
{"text":"This place is so clean! You don't see that often anymore. Plus food and service is great!"}
{"text":"Yummy donuts...some really big donuts!! Want to come back to try the breakfast burrito they looked really tasty."}
{"text":"I really would rather rate this place a 4 and a half but the customer service was very kind and patient. The donuts are good but not soft like say a Bosa or Dunkin and although it's not my preference, it is my Dads lol he LOVED it plus they have like a vanilla/buttermilk flavor"}
{"text":"Wow, what a great and friendly service, great location and plenty of options here! Love this place and plan on coming back many more times!"}
{"text":"Gotta say, best donuts I have had ever! The quality of these donuts go 'Beyond' Krispy Kremes and Dunkin Donuts. I finished a whole bag of donut holes before I could even get to my car! And they have breakfast burritos and sandwiches and stuff (The Beyond Burrito is pretty amazing by the way.) Definitely check this place out whenever you get the chance."}
{"text":"I was a bit nervous about this place at first. The pictures show a fairly basic number of donuts types, which is fair. However, they know their stuff. These are quality donuts, especially for their price! I got a blueberry donut, old-fasioned, crumb, and a chocolate-glazed sprinkle. The raised donuts were very light and airy - just how I like them. The old-fashioned had a nice, slight crunch to the outside, while being delicate on the inside. 

I didn't see any maple-bacon when I was in, but found out later that the owner puts the bacon on fresh - to keep it from getting soggy! 

The owner mentioned that he also intends to add more drinks (right now its mainly hot coffees and hot chocolate), such as Thai tea and iced coffees. The owner hoped to have this going near Summer. 

In less than a year the NW valley has found two very quality donut shops!"}
{"text":"This local donut shop was amazing. Fast, friendly, and the food was great. Come early, or they may run out of the donuts you want! We also tried a breakfast burrito and a pastrami sandwich on croissant, and they were both very good too. The only bad thing is that we will be moving, so we can't come back as any times as we would like!"}
{"text":"Can't speak for the donuts because I'm on a diet:) but I heard about the breakfast burritos and thought I'd try one. The Beyond Burrito (eggs, ham, onions, tomatoes, green peppers, cheese) was cooked fresh, hot and delicious. It will bring me back again. The other burritos have potato so I appreciate them offering a higher protein option. Veggies were fresh and flavorful and ham was good. The other customer chose The Desperado with chorizo and potatoes, egg and cheese and he said it was very good. This place will definitely become a healthy quick alternative to a fast lunch or brunch."}
{"text":"Burritos are amazing! Donuts are delicious though they are always sold out of the ones I want by 9 am.     Also got the Thai Tea boba last time and it was yummy too. Best of all...the ladies are all very nice."}
{"text":"Happy people who connect with the customer. Did I mention they are serving delicious donuts? What's not to like? A display case filled with an array of delicious sweet love. Regular customers are recognized by staff and greeted warmly. But then EVERYONE is greeted warmly. Try the other menu items. Equally delicious. It doesn't have great exposure but definitely worth making the effort to find."}
{"text":"We stopped in on 4-30 and we were very disappointed. How this place got high ratings is a mystery to us! We walked in and an employee was taking up one of the few tables to assemble boxes. We ordered 2 donuts and coffee and told there was no coffee, that she would have to brew it...really, at 9AM??? Donuts were very greasy and awful. Coffee tasted bad. Very UNFRIENDLY  employees..avoid this place!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy! Awesome breakfast burritos and apple fritters!  And they will fill your long john with cream upon request.  Prices are verrrry reasonable and owners very friendly and offer quick service.  Good coffee an added bonus.  I highly recommend to all."}
{"text":"The staff and environment there was extremely friendly and kind! Did I mention they have the most delicious donuts in Phoenix! I would definitely recommend this to all my friends."}
{"text":"They have the BEST DONUTS in the world!! I love this shop. Tigertails and bacon donuts are magical!!"}
{"text":"Holy sugar overdose!!!  I think I have diabetes so bad it's contagious.  These doughnuts are dangerous.  So Good!  The service was great (although I got the wrong sized drink delivered to me), friendly, and fast despite the crowd.  My son got a doughnut the size of my thigh.  It was questionable if he could finish, but he worked past his gag reflex.  Now, we're off to the gym for a weeklong treadmill extravaganza!"}
{"text":"Love stopping by here in the mornings. Friendly staff great tasting food I will refer all of my friends"}
{"text":"Great breakfast sandwhiches cheap.  Donuts are fresh tasting and yumm! Clean place and friendly people."}
{"text":"If you LOVE apple fritters like I do, you know how difficult it is to find a decent one in AZ.  But finally I have found them!  Not only are the fritters fantastic, they come in two sizes, normal and huge!  Love them!"}
{"text":"amazing donuts this can be the next krispy kreme of donuts can be the next running up who knows life is short so would like to see this company succeed and be the best at what they do there doing a great job so far so why not expect the best for them keep it up"}
{"text":"This place is beyond amazing. Not only are the donuts the best I've ever had, the service is top notch. Breakfast sandwiches/burritos are fantastic. It's great to see a business show pride in its endeavor. I will always be a customer."}
{"text":"What is it about Asian donut shops? I had been a fan of Bosa Donuts but there aren't any all that close to my home and my wife had wanted to find another place nearby and found Beyond Donuts so we gave it a try. We were both very impressed. The raised Donuts are so incredibly soft and the ones with a glaze melt in your mouth. I prefer a plain raised glazed and either a lemon- or raspberry-filled, preferably with powdered sugar but glazed will do if the other isn't available.

I actually picked up some Bosa and Beyond Donuts to do a direct comparison and Beyond's are better.

Having donuts like this will make you never want to try supermarket donuts ever again and Dunkin' Donuts and Crispy Creme aren't even in the same league. Give Beyond Donuts a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Who doesn't like donuts!!! Right??? May not be good for us but a warm donut fresh out is always good. I would of hope the atmosphere was better though. Still the donuts are good! ;) can't go wrong"}
