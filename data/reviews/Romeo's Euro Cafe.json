{"text":"The Golden Gate sandwich.  What more can I say?  I have dreams about it.......good ones.  Pastrami, bacon, swiss cheese and 1000 island dressing on a tasty sub roll and then baked.  This is my favorite sandwich in the valley.  Pair it with the homemade chips and bbq sauce and you are sure to be happy.

The place is really nice too.  Great selection of wine!"}
{"text":"Went to Euro Cafe last Friday evening for a bite to eat before a 7:30 show at the Hale Theater.  We arrived at 5:30 ordered 2 glasses of wine and 2 beers immediately and our dinner by 5:45PM.  The salads for the two entrees that came with a salad were not served until 6:22 without waiter apology or and update as to what was happening in the kitchen.  The four entrees finally arrived at 6:36, more than an hour after we arrived.  Not satisfactory at all! The place was packed and looked very under-staffed.  On a show night, they should be more prepared to get guests in and out.  We received no apology, no offer of any kind for our poor service.  I ordered a simple Greek Salad that was so covered in feta cheese, that I couldn't eat it, too overwhelming.  Not a return visit in our future."}
{"text":"My very favorite place to eat in Gilbert, it is the tiny restaurant with the big menu and big portions.  We have always had great service and fresh, delicious food."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was amazing. We will definitely return. We had the greka for an app, I want to start making his at home! The. The house salad was to die for, and finally the entrees! The artichoke salmon was amazing and so was the stuffed shells spinachi. We were so full we were not able to even order dessert. We will come back to try those out! I have stopped by and gotten coffee many times prior to this, and I have always been very pleased with it. I think I have a new favorite spot to eat."}
{"text":"Actually, I'd give it 3.5 stars.  Let's just say, this isn't the restaurant to go to if you don't like talking to the person/people you're with.  Luckily I was with someone I'm very comfortable talking to because you'll get LOTS AND LOTS OF TIME TO TALK while waiting for your food to arrive.  The server was a nice guy and for the most part very helpful, though I wish he would've noticed our empty glasses while we were in the midst of waiting for our soup/salad.  We started with the calamari and neither of us were impressed.  Pretty tasteless and under cooked.  Soup and salad were good.  Our entrees (I had the veal and she had a seafood/pasta dish) were gigantic and good.  Could've used a bit more seasoning on both.  The bread it came with was also good.  Just to give you an idea of time, we arrived at 6:00 and didn't have the entrees in front of us until 7:30.  Keep that in mind if you have set plans later in the evening.  We didn't, so this elongated dinner experience wasn't a problem.  What made it worthwhile is that we each took home plenty of leftovers and the desserts were GREAT.  Wound up buying them on the way out (from the counter) and eating them at home.  The atmosphere is nice and I'll probably eat here again.  Just don't be in a hurry..."}
{"text":"I have to agree with 1 of the other reviews posted. The menu is over extensive, while it's nice to have variety, having too large a menu can seem daunting. However, as daunting as the menu was, the food that I ordered was disappointing to say the least.
 The starter we had was Artichoke with ranch. Bland and tasteless.
I ordered the Lamb pita and the meat was dry and leathery, didn't enjoy it at all.
  The dessert was Creme Brûlée. I had tried some of the same dessert the night before at another restaurant and compared to that, this wasn't even a consideration.
 I won't be dining there again, it took almost 45 mins to get our food!"}
{"text":"If you prefer your salad dressing on the side, or to modify your food at all do not go here!! They do not allow you to add items to food, take a2ay items such as mayonnaise or salad dressing, or even ask for a differant dressing on your salad!  It's part of the \"salad experience \" I understand wanting to stick to a menu but not allowing a customer to ask for a food item to be left out for health reasons or for something to be served on the side is really rediculous. Won't be going back again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite place.  Huge menu..there is for-sure something for everyones tastes.
Great service, great food, good prices."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for lunch because most of the surrounding restaurants were packed, but they had plenty of tables available. There were only a few tables with patrons so we were seated immediately.

The menu is several pages long making it time consuming to look through, so the waiter was asking us if we were ready to order before either of us were. He was very patient with our need for more time and recommended the Feta Gyro when I asked what was good.

We also ordered the Eggplant Cappicola appetizer and the Avacado Pita (for my wife). The eggplant and prosciutto in the appetizer were overpowered by the cheese and breading, and a bit bland. Meanwhile, my gyro was overly salty but generally enjoyable. My wife enjoyed her pita, but couldn't really taste the avacado.

 Overall, Romeo's is a pretty good restaurant with decent portion sizes, but not somewhere we're likely to come back to often."}
{"text":"I've gone back here several times but most recently with my husband.  Their wine selection is stellar.  The portions are generous enough to have leftovers for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"The menu is large and looks like it is full of enticing options, but the food was just so-so.  I really liked my server (Zach) but I could have done without the patio furniture you have to sit on in the dining room.  Overall, you get the feeling these guys want to be exclusive fine dining but the dining room feels like the kid's table at thanksgiving."}
{"text":"Had a lovely anniversary dinner here for the monthly 3rd Tuesday-3 courses-3 wines. I cannot say enough wonderful things about the meal and our experience!!  We will be back! 
1st course :SLIDER TRIO / 2013 Bertani Velante Pinot Grigio  Veneto 
2nd course:CORNISH GAME HEN FLORENTINE / 2013 Hangtime Pinot Noir 
3rd course :Christine's FILLO WRAPPED  BROWNIE / Regio Dark  Lodi"}
{"text":"I come here for the Gryo platter! It is phenomenal along with the freshness of the vegetables.  Great place that I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have just finished dinner at Romero euro cafe and I am extremely disappointed. It looked appealing from the outside and we were seated very quickly, however the remainder of our experience went downhill from there. First of all, the menu was overwhelming; at least 30 different entrees and 20 separate appetizers. This should have been a clue regarding the quality of the dishes.  Nevertheless, we ordered 2 appetizers which took over 30 minutes to arrive and then our entrees followed in about five minutes. If the food had been spectacular, or even edible, the timing would have been forgiven. However, I truly believe that due to the large menu and quick turn around time that most of the meals were either pre-made or frozen. Even the manicotti was unappetizing and could not be eaten. When we asked for Parmesan cheese, we were told it would be an extra 1:50 charge. We left our meals untouched and the waiter did not look surprised. It was a waste of money and I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Save yourself, your cash and your stomachs and frequent one of the excellent places across the street."}
{"text":"After reading all the bad reviews about the service, we were a little worried to try this place, but there was NO surly, slow waiter, but instead a group of young, efficient, friendly waitresses.  We went at a very busy time and had to wait a bit, but once seated the service and the food were great!  And a warning to all -- the quantities are large, so it is a good idea to find a dish and an appetizer to share, as you will have a large doggy bag to carry home if you don't!"}
{"text":"I give this place 2 stars.. Here's why: the atmosphere is super cute and they have fun jewelry and art on sale in the front. However, I won't be returning.. The smell in there is pretty off putting when you first walk in. In hopes that I'd get acclimated quickly, I proceeded to eat lunch there yesterday, even though the smell in there was quite rough. The service is fine enough and food is decent. However, the smell left behind on my clothing and hair was so horrendous that I had to change everything I was wearing, even my bra, to escape the smell. The whole laundry room smelled bad from our clothes being in the hamper for 2 hours. I washed with heavy detergent and I can still smell that smell lurking in the fabric. 

I hope they get their ventilation system worked on soon and work on getting more fans installed."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in downtown Gilbert. Huge menu selection, top notch service, wine menu, andddd the dessert bar!!! This would make a perfect date night or ladies night out. Good atmosphere, enjoyed the meal and will definitely return. 

Went with a group of four so we sampled a bit from pasta to salads and of course dessert all exceeded expectations."}
{"text":"Outside its kinda new olde town. Walking in I instantly developed a craving for red wine. This was quickly quenched with a fantastic TOHU Pinot Noir! Then after browsing the impressive menu (Greek cuisine) I asked out loud, \"Do I have to get salmon AGAIN?\" Naturally the answer was YES! The Santa Fe chicken soup was a very nice appetizer. When the fish came I about fainted because it looked so good. The presentation, the quantity, the flavors, all exquisite. I'm a big fan!

Our server was very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is what you need it to be. If you want to be casual, you can do it. If you want to go formal, that could work too. I know there was music playing, but it blended in with the whole experience so well that I have no recollection of it. Top it off with a very good key lime tart for dessert and I went home extremely happy.

I definitely recommend trying this cafe for a special treat with someone you treasure."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food last night.  Our waitress was great however.  We haven't been in about 6 months, but we always look forward to delicious food here.  We got our usual lamb balls, which were overdone and NOT piping hot as they usually are.  We tried the mushroom & artichoke appetizer for the 1st time, and it was lukewarm, the mushrooms were hard, and it was flavorless.  My son & I got the soup which was inedible due to over salting.  The salads my husband & daughter got were overloaded with dressing.  We all got the gyro platter, which was good as always, but the presentation lacked somewhat.  I didn't see the owner there last night, which is curious.  Did they switch ownership?  Romeo's is normally packed on a Friday night, but there were tables open.  Too bad...there are great restaurant choices in downtown Gilbert now, so Romeos needs to get it together or they will be finished.  We won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I love this place, the presence of Romeo in the restaurant makes this place very special."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in several years and I thought it the food here was delicious then, but they seem to have been slacking on both the quality of their food and especially their service.

I normally don't care if a restaurant doesn't allow substitutions, but this place doesn't even allow substitutions for allergies. Even El Bulli takes allergies into consideration. If you're in Gilbert, Arizona, you need to be flexible with your menu. I'm sorry. A friend in our party got the apparently common blasé lecture from the waitress about the aforementioned \"policy\" when I was last here. I understand that the \"no substitutions\" policy is sometimes necessary for places with a high-volume turnover in order to keep the kitchen efficient, but please, the line-cook isn't going to lose sleep over leaving the mushrooms out of a dish or whatever.

I ordered the \"Kasseri Chicken\" dish and it was fairly bland and not nearly what I remembered this place being regards flavors. Each person in our group agreed that the food was just \"adequate\". I used to quite like this place, so I don't understand what has happened in the last year or so.

Less \"off-nights\" and more \"on-nights\", please."}
{"text":"Well I must say a little, no a lot disappointed. I remeber back in high school thinking how cool this place was for coffee and dessert. It still is for that.  Dinner was bland. Yep that is all I can say no flavor had two apps,  soup, and dinner.   The only ones in the place the whole time for dinner (well over an hour). THE plus side our service was awesome! !!!"}
{"text":"We've been going to Euro Café for years now.   The food and service is always good.  We lover that we can order a sandwich type entrée at dinner.   Their regular dinner entrée are very good too."}
{"text":"What an authentic place. The guy at Bergie's coffee told me to try it and glad I did. I took some out of town visitors here and they loved it. I was told not to try to substitute anything at this place so right off the bat I knew the owner had passion for his place. Kinda like the soup Nazi on Seinfeld.

It looks like they serve coffee in the morning, they have a large variety of desserts. We went for lunch and were not disappointed. I ordered something I never heard of before some sort of cranberry pork tenderloin dish, it rocked. 

the service was kinda slow was my only complaint. They need more servers in there.The food takes a while to get out because they actually make real food 

It was the top spot for my out of town visitors, cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"The wedding this last weekend was great. Food, drinks and dancing by the pool could not have been better. Makes me think about doing it again just need a bride."}
{"text":"The spiced chai latte is one of the best things I've ever tasted!
Slightly on the expensive side, but has a great location in downtown Gilbert. The desserts are amazing as well! Highly recommended, it's definitely a must if you're walking around downtown Gilbert."}
{"text":"Such a cute cafe with a great ambiance. Their Euro-style cuisine is definitely unique in a good way! Definitely recommend this place! Everything from their food, coffee, and dessert is amazing! Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This is an absolutely excellent restaurant with a wonderful ambience! It is always nice to have great food, but even better when it is enhanced by the look and feel of the restaurant.

We went there on Saturday, November 11, at approximately 2:30 in the afternoon.

We were hungry for Gyros as we had not had one for a long time. Romeo's Euro Cafe did not disappoint! Their Gyros were succulent, juicy and fresh, not to mention plentiful. After our meal, we found out during a conversation with Romeo that he makes his gyro meat from scratch. No wonder it was so succulent!

We had an outstanding meal with great service! Please go and experience it for yourself. The menu is large, with many items, all of which will impress!"}
{"text":"Average food.  Sorry I can't give a better rating.  Service was excellent.  Waitress was friendly.  All other open kitchen staff coming and going never acknowledged the customers.  Sandwich had wilted, nearly slimy lettuce.  Meat was lean but bland. The person that made the sandwich knows exactly how unfresh the sandwich content was."}
{"text":"The food here is always amazing. They don't allow subtitutions or alterations at all, but that's ok (unless you have an allergy.)  Great alcohol selection.
BUT it gets weird...
The second time we went here, the server, a woman in her 40s, was verrry chatty.  She sat down at our table with us and chatted about everything and anything.  At one point, she told us about how she keeps a box of Capt'n Crunch by her toilet and eats it while she's doing her business!  \"Capt'n Crunch and Captain Morgan are my two best friends!\" she said.  She actually seemed a bit drunk.  
As my husband and I ate, my 14-yr-old son wasn't feeling well so he went to sit outside and get fresh air.  The waitress continued talking to us as we ate our meals.  At the end, she offered to take our plates or box the rest up and I told her just to take the plates, since we were going to a movie next and couldn't store them properly.  
In front of the owner/manager lady who was there, the waitress (and I think the manager was in on it too!) boxed up our un-eaten food, saying she'd have it tonight for dinner!!! I'm pretty sure the manager took some of it also...including my sick son's half-eaten burger.  (My son was sick from allergies, but they didn't know this!)
Overall, it was a really entertaining/surreal experience with great food. I'll go back again if I can make sure this waitress isn't there."}
{"text":"I gave this restaurant 2 stars because my food tasted really good. The reason for the low rating was because our server shouldn't be a server. He's too timid and didn't have any customer service skills. There were 4 of us and our food took an hour to get to our table. Three of us got our food and the 4th person had to wait even longer. The late dish (spinach stuffed shells) didn't have any spinach in it. Plus they ran out of shells. Lol. Omg....not a good night. But I gave them 2 stars because I loved my food once it arrived!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely little restaurant that serves a great selection of delicious Mediterranean food. I love to go there for a lunch out with my mom. However, my dad is gluten intolerant and although he has been assured by the waitstaff that his meal will be gluten free, he has become quite ill a couple of times after eating there. Beware that if you should not eat gluten, don't try eating at the Euro Cafe."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a lunch date the other day. I must say the food was wonderful but the service very poor. The waiter barely said 2 words to us. He took forever to get our drink order, food order, box up food and get us our check. Usually a waiter should be somewhat cheerful and friendly. This took away a lot from our experience. I would 100% come back if there was better service unfortunately this is not the first review like this and I have a feeling it's the same waiter."}
{"text":"I think it's great that they have a huge menu, but there is almost TOO much to choose from. Not to mention, the server didn't seem to know much about the menu. I enjoyed the decor and the wine bottle selections. The reason I gave this two stars is because we walked in 2 hours before they closed-- Our meals took 30 minutes to arrive, and when my friend didn't like his, and pushed it forward, the waitress didn't ask if he wanted a box or if he enjoyed it. He even told her it didn't taste the way he expected it to... I forced mine down, and let me tell you - minimal sauce and minimal flavor. What an expensive evening for such a horrible end result. Saw the owner/manager talking to her employees and obviously some friends of hers, but never came over to say \"thanks for stopping in\" like most business owners do. I won't go back here, and if I do, it would only be for their delicious desserts in the front display. It took us quite a while to get our bill too. Bleh. Never again."}
{"text":"A little crowded and tight but good service and generally decent food.  They have a decent wine list and food is usually very good.  Some occasional hiccups keep this from receiving 5 stars but all in all this is a good safe bet."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch last week. Have heard all kind of good things about it. It was really just OK. I had some sort of pita sandwhich  - with chicken and artichokes. Although good tasting, you could not eat it as a sandwhich because the yogurt sauce was drenching everything else, which made the pita bread too wet to pick up. Since I had to go back to work, I did not need the yogurt sauce all over the front of my shirt. 
Friends had salmon salad - she said it was quite good. My boss had the spicy pasta and said it was actually pretty bland. 
Will probably head back to Liberty Market across the street next time."}
{"text":"Been going to Euro Cafe for years, the feta dressing alone will keep me coming back. Our server was attentive and the food came out fast and piping hot. I get the fries with the feta dressing every time I go. The fries are nothing fancy but they serve as a perfect foundation for the amazing feta dressing. The garlic pesto chicken is awesome. The pesto cream sauce with the chicken and pine nuts is a mouth watering combination! Check them out!"}
{"text":"I live in Tennessee and my parents live in AZ.  Every year I crave going to Romeo's during Christmas break.  Fantastic place.  Definitely get something that involves the feta cheese salad dressing.  Avoid the Mediterranean Gyro.  Every single other menu item is amazing."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place since I was a kid. When it was on longmore still. It's always been my favorite place and I love the food, it's amazing! However, some recent visits there was bothersome to me. I am bothered by how their staff reacts to request to an order change. It seems like the staff is scared of management and I don't like that vibe at all. The past few times I've been in I was told I can't make any substitutions to my order. I ask anyway. The most recent time I asked its the conversation that occurred that makes me think twice about returning. I asked if I could have my gyro without the yogurt sauce and have feta dressing on it instead (the feta sauce is out of this world good!) and my server in a very low voice (almost a whisper.) said  \"That isn't allowed. The chef (who is also the owner) gets mad.\" At first I thought the servers were just being difficult but I see the same complaint on other reviews. I felt like this server was intimidated. As much as I enjoy the food and like the environment the cafe offers, I cannot bring myself to support a place that seems to have a hostile work environment."}
{"text":"Came there on a first time visit to eat. Food was Ok, but what really got me was being bullied into having them take my water bottle (which had no writing on the bottle) and stick it in their fridge. First of all, there are NO posted signs upon entering that says they do not permit outside water, secondly, get a life. It was 120 degrees on record in Phoenix that day and we were from out of town. Rude ass owners. Way to drum up business. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and have gone for years.  The food does take more time because it is made FRESH and it is delicious.  Although they do not like to alter the items on the menu you are sure to find something you will love.  I have always had a great time at the restaurant with friendly servers and wonderful dishes.  I highly recommend this restaurant and love to bring my friends and family when they visit us."}
{"text":"My friend and I had stopped in to check it out, we had a great time! The service was amazing we were told everything was made to order and our orders would be able to custom if we didn't like something.

So I wanted to take my Fiance back
WOW Server was HORRIBLE- I told the server that I was not a big fan of sauce on my Gyro, he told me they were unable to omit the sauce.. weird considering the server the week before had told me the contrary.
So I just ended up with a traditional Gyro so I can have it on the side... well when it came out there was literally a cup of sauce on it... I was pretty annoyed. So I asked to have the sauce on the side. 

This server was horrible.
I had to ask to get drinks, ask for sweetener, He was so soft spoken that we had to keep saying \"HUH\", \"WHAT\", \"AH EXCUS ME\" 

Probably will go back but if that server is there again, I will end up at BBQ I think."}
{"text":"Always a great time at Euro Cafe!  The atmosphere and the food are amazing.  This is definitely my favorite \"go to\" place to feel at home and enjoy a good meal."}
{"text":"Went once and won't be back to give it a second chance. 

At first glance it looks nice enough.  The large dessert case upon entry caught our eye.   We were seated relatively quickly.  The menu offerings are varied and some might agree there's too many choices.  I've heard a lot of famous chefs say over the years that you should pick a few things that you do very well and stick to a limited choice of excellent dishes.  That's probably good advice here. 

Prices seemed high for what we received.  Add to that both appetizer and entrees were somewhat cold and very bland with virtually no seasoning.  Best part of the evening was asking if they could leave the cheese off a salad and being told absolutely not, that they do not allow any customization of their menu items.  When there's so many other great places to go in such close proximity in downtown Gilbert, you're going to yell at your paying customers that they can not, in fact, have it their way?  Seems like a bad business model if you ask me.   Also it begs the question - just how many of these items on this vast menu are pre-made vs. being made-to-order? 

Honestly it was quite a disappointing experience.  I see quite a few of the other 1 and 2 star reviews have voiced similar issues, so at least I know our experience wasn't entirely unique."}
{"text":"I love the place.  Every dish is unique...no Applebee's microwave stuff here.  Yes the menu is extensive but that just means you have more to chose from.  Whatever you do make sure to leave room for one of their fantastic desserts."}
{"text":"If the food wasn't good, this place would be screwed. I don't see it lasting very much longer now that there are more delicious restaurants nearby. They don't care about the costumers wants and needs at all! I worked at a restaurant nearby that would satisfy any customers needs no matter what! I was told adding RAW ONION to a pita would cost 50 cents. I paid for it anyway because I wanted the onion, but it made my already ridiculously priced pita even more stupidly expensive. 
On top of this, a friend went with me and wanted one of the \"pocket subs\" to be in a pita instead. They wouldn't do it!! What is that?!? I know she will for sure never return because an apology wasn't given and she felt like they wanted her to leave after she asked for the substitution. Worst customer service ever!!"}
{"text":"I have been to Romeo's Euro Café several times and have tried several dishes. I have never been disappointed. Favorites include the pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon- so good! I also really like the eggplant dishes- very unique and quite tasty. The desserts are of course all baked right there and the selection is incredible and they will not disappoint. The wine selection is vast and the wait staff is knowledgeable. These are the reasons that I keep returning. I can highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Service from the kitchen is horribly slow. I've been sitting here for 20 minutes after I placed my order (I was here 10 before I could do that), and still haven't even been served the soup. And the restaurant isn't even full!"}
{"text":"We happened upon this little treasure while wandering around Gilbert and loved it! I had the Monte Karlo pita and it was delish! I'm usually pretty skeptical about places that claim to have authentic european/greek type food but the pita bread was some of the best I've ever had and everything was very fresh and authentic. I would highly recommend this place, plus they have a great wine selection as well!"}
{"text":"I saw Romeo's on \"Check Please\" with my parents and they wanted to give it a try. Based on the Yelp reviews and the massive menu I was a bit skeptical, but I am so glad that we took the plunge. 

We went for lunch and we all split an appetizer, 2 pitas, and fries for the 3 of us. The appetizer, the Feta Dill Fritters (gyro meat, dill, and feta deep fried and served with a yogurt sauce) were sublime. They make their own gyro meat and it shows. The feta gyro pita (gyro, feta, and artichoke hearts) was similarly exceptional as was the pastrami cream pita (cream cheese, pastrami, avocado, and provolone). What shocked me, however, was how good the fries were. They were double fried steak fries that had the perfect balance between crispiness with a little potato flavor on the inside. Served with feta dressing and big enough to share, they were a surprising star. Finally, while we were too stuffed, there is a massive dessert case that tempted us to change our mind and try to fit it in, but we couldn't do it. I highly recommend sharing due to the large portion sizes so that you can have room.

Overall,  it was a great experience and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just a quick review.  Lunch was yummy.  :)

I really wanted to talk about customer service.  Christina is an amazing hostess!!  I wanted to say Thank you!   I think it is easy for some people to forget that service matters!  It was a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"I ate here last week with some friends from college.  I wasn't sure what to expect since I had seen good reviews and bad reviews.  That atmosphere was nice but don't like the fact that you need a special key for the bathroom which is not inside the restaurant.

The menu is way to big.  It took us 25 minutes at least to order.   One thing that upset me was that the waitress said you can't make substitutions.   At the same time she also said everything was made fresh.  Seems like a small thing, but couldn't let it go. 

Portions sizes were big, only ate half my meal.  We ordered dessert and went over to the case to see what they had.  Besides the fly in the case sitting on one of the cakes it looked good.  We ordered some dessert and for the money I would say pass and go somewhere else.  This was the smallest slice of cake I have ever been served.  Some of the others at my table complained that their cake was really dry. The waitress also split the check for the party but already added a 20% gratuity according to my friend.  I didn't verify the percent but seems excessive for auto gratuity which is traditionally 18%.   Spent 66 dollars for two entrees two desserts and two sodas.    There are  many better places to spend my money,  I won't be back,  sorry euro cafe."}
{"text":"Went to the party room for a reception.   We got to sample a bunch of the food.   It was so good!  The service was great also.   Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"So went to this place for the first time with my mom. So I ordered the gyros asked for it with whole wheat pita it came out with regular the meat I'm sorry but the lamb isn't supposed to be so thick worst gyros I've ever had. My mom enjoyed her meal. The problem with this place is that theirs too much on the menu and the menu is all over the map in terms of style if they stuck with a couple of dishes they do well and add some specials it would be a lot better. I could've just ordered their dessert because that's where they excel. Wouldn't ever go back to this place for lunch or dinner. Dessert yes"}
{"text":"Great little Mediterranean joint. Only uses the freshest ingredients.  Get the \"Popcorn Calimari\" for an appetizer! Get a side salad with the \"House Feta Dressing\"! I've never had a bad entree and they have always tasted delicious.  Thanks Romeo!"}
{"text":"It was recommended that we go here. I was here for a girlfriends going away dinner. It was exceptionally oily. I had ravioli with artichoke. It was soaked in sauce and I had to dig for the ravioli. My friends had eggplant with layered meat sauce in between and she sent it back. It was all oil. The waitress said that they would definitely not refund her.... Probably the most rude thing I have heard. My other friend didn't speak up and just took the meal home but definitely didn't eat it. Very oily. I would not go here again or recommend it."}
{"text":"Great locally owned neighborhood restaurant.  They have an enormous menu and equally large portions -- terrific value.  Excellent wine selection as well.

To Kim S. with the aversion to mushrooms, there are over 100 items on the menu without mushrooms for you to choose from.  I would give you an exact number, but I had to stop counting at 107 when I got to page 13 of the menu because my phone started ringing."}
{"text":"This place gets a 2 star deduction for 2 reasons.  If i was grading on food only, I would surely give them a 5 star rating.  They don't do any substitutions and I understand that.  I have no problem with that, It is how the chef designed the food.  You don't tell an artist how to paint...

My first issue is the obnoxious waitress.  She was withdrawn and cranky.  She let out long breaths and responded in a monotone fashion to the few questions we had about menu items.  

The second issue is the way she reacted when my friend asked about an ingredient in a dish.  She had an allergy to a particular food and wanted to make sure it wasn't in the dish.  She was not asking to remove it from the dish or alter the dish in any way, but this waitress started to flip out.  It was just easier to drop the situation and pick another dish that we were sure the ingredient was not it.  

I find that the overall experience of a restaurant with sub-par food can be saved by excellent service... not the other way around"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been going there for years and love it. Probably the best in Gilbert hands down.  Every time we go we try something different, you will not run short of choices.  The people who complain about an over extensive menu are probably the same people who would complain that there were not enough choices at other places or they order the same thing over and over at each visit somewhere else.  You go to a place like this to try different things in life.  Yes, it takes a little time to get your order but that is because the items are made to order, not sitting in a warming bin somewhere in the kitchen like the large chains.  We have never been disappointed.  It's quaint and tucked away.  The wine choices are extensive.  We have recommended this place to several of our friends and no one has ever been sorry for going there.  Give it a try and try something that you will not get anywhere else and enjoy!!!
Don Y."}
{"text":"The ambiance is amazing. Very comfortable and the wine selection is Amazing! I would give it 5 stars but I want to try more items and some of their desserts made on sight."}
{"text":"First time here.  Had the Mandarin Dijon salad.  It was loaded and delicious.  I took half of it home.  Topped it off with a raspberry sponge cake dessert...can't remember the exact name but it was heavenly.  The menu is extensive and service was great.  Definitely will be returning to eat my way through the menu."}
{"text":"With all the chain restaurants popping up in Gilbert, Romeo's Euro Café stands out. Romeo is adorable. Homemade cooking. Huge menu, so many choices, very hard to choose. Large wine list. 
What is exceptional here is that they have a pastry chef. They have a display case at the entrance with many homemade cakes. I had a white chocolate, coconut, Malibu cake, which was very good.
Think of reserving, seating is limited."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place... 

Two of us stopped in today for lunch after hearing all of the good reviews. 
I needed to use the restroom. The hostess handed me a dirty spatula with a key attached and said the restroom was outside around the corner...ummm OK. 
The restroom has no AC. Great in the summer!
We asked for a few minuets to look over the huge menu. We didn't see the server for another 10 minuets. 

We ordered two things to split. 
The first was the Grilled Steak Pita. It is steak with mushrooms and Swiss cheese. They are not kidding. That is all that is on it. It was really bland, but OK I guess. 
The other choice was the Bleu Danube. It has Grilled turkey breast and ham blended with bleu cheese and topped with Swiss cheese (copied from the menu). It is a HUGE portion. My half had a TON of blue cheese sauce on it... too much. It was way overwhelming. It also seemed very salty. You might as well drink warm blue cheese dressing. 
It took a really long time to get our food and bill. Don't go here if you are in a hurry for lunch. 

I'm just bummed. I really wanted to dig this place. 
Oh Well...

The dessert case looked good..."}
{"text":"So many options! But everything is so delicious and the service is great! I am always in the mood for this place."}
{"text":"My favorite server is Patrick :) I love the food and they have an amazing Cappuccino (A real cappuccino) in the desserts are out of this world."}
{"text":"Loved it here!  Hubby and I were in town and had dinner with a college friend.  We asked for a place that was \"uniquely Phoenix\" and he suggested this place.  Despite the overwhelming menu, we had a helpful server who navigated us through the whole thing.  He gave the very useful tip of sharing entrees (which we did) and made recommendations on the appetizer.  We had the spicy lamb potatoes which were very tasty and followed it up with one of the chef specials, a creamy pasta dish with sausage and mushrooms.  Delicious!  Even with the two of us splitting it, we still had a lot leftover, so I would venture to say with an appetizer, one of those entrees is enough for 3 people.

Very cute atmosphere and the desserts looked amazing even though we were too full to try anything.  Would definitely recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"Quaint and sweet. Service is great and so is there food. The menu is quite large and can be overwhelming but so far EVERYTHING  that I have ordered from it has been so delicious.  I recommend this place with a five star rating!"}
{"text":"The food is terrific. Service is not. Toughen up and get the farfalle pesce. Best seafood Alfredo dish in gilbert. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food was good. It just seems to be trying to hard to be a pretentious French hole in the wall that deserves the prices it charges. Again, the food was good, the cramped seating not so much. If you can beat the rush and don't order off the entre menu you can have a great experience that is worth the price."}
{"text":"I don't know Romeo, but I have met him a few times over at what used to be \"The Asian Kitchen\".  He was a frequent guest, as was I.  I always meant to make it over to Old Town Gilbert to try his food.  Well, today was my day.  We just moved in about 200 yards from the strip.  My son and I walked down to the Cafe for lunch and we were not disappointed?.  So much to choose from.  The menu is quite involved and it's creative.  Both of us were more than happy with the food.  I went simple... (its lunch).  The Giro was fantastic.  The sauce was light, not strong and heavy.  Just right.  The Pita was fresh and delicious?.   I'll be coming back... A LOT."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now, and have enjoyed every visit.  The portions are very generous, service has been friendly, and prices are reasonable.  With my gyros pita today (which was great), I added their homemade chips.  These were particularly tasty!  It's nice that this place is a bit \"off-the-beaten-path,\" and not an absolute mob scene like the places down the street.  Quaint ambiance as well.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great food! Awesome bakery.

Loved the dill feta fritters and the fried ravioli salad was delicious (though it could have used a little less red onions for my taste). Their dijon vinaigrette was also very good.

For dessert, we had \"Evening's Embrace\" and florentines. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best restaurants I've ever been to.Y ou're going to want to get an order of the spanoki balls and the french fries trust me you won't regret it.  From the burgersubs to the stuffshells to the desserts It is all high quality, delicious food. If you in downtown Gilbert drop by and just order an appetizer you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So in love with this place. I highly recommend the Almond Tortellini and my boyfriend ordered the Pest Chicken which was also amazing. Wish I knew about this place years ago!"}
{"text":"Go here!!  I went for the 3/3/3 event (3 courses, 3 wines, 3rd Tuesday) and was impressed. 

Wonderful:  I don't even like eating Wilbur and nearly rejected the pork tenderloin but my wise self found that (even warmed up the next day) that wasn't tender, melt-in-your-mouth, as soft as butter. Soooooo good! Such a touch with seasonings!  Is there a better phrase than good-smelling? Scented? Food that I wanted to inhale the scent first, and then again in the back of my mouth. I also liked the choices the chef made: tidy bits of daikon in the salad to complement the proscuitto and watermelon, cauliflower puree instead of potato with the pork, and of course, the Marion berry liqueur sauce on the chocolate \"fudgy cake\".  That cake was so rich, so smooth, so satisfying, I won't need chocolate for a week!

We had no problems with service here, instead we remarked at how well the few servers handled the large group.

Why it's not a 5 instead:  the portions were huge, which could be an issue for me alone, but why do leftovers? I like food prepared fresh and the price was reasonable enough for smaller plates that could be savored, enjoyed and remembered but not refrigerated overnight. The food was not always consistently plated/prepped - perhaps a new crew?  The first two bites of the puff pastry were filled with porcini mushrooms, fragrant and hearty, but the rest of it was onions and feta. Looked for the lovely peppercorns that Romeo talked about - my companion had them, but I had none. The accompaniments on the pork (fig, green peppercorn) were also unevenly portioned. Some of us had mostly onions, which were good but we wanted figs and apples, too.

I'll be back and will edit if it makes that 5."}
{"text":"Romeo's is one of those places that is casual & unassuming but serves really high quality, delicious food. if memory serves, the chef does not allow substitutions, which I'm totally ok with.

so anyway. I nearly always get the roasted almond tortellini, because it's fucking amazing. it has almonds, mushrooms, sunflower seeds, hearts of palm, et al, and it's beyond delicious. the portions are huge, so I always get at least 3 meals out of one dish of pasta.

also, they have a shit ton of amazing desserts. I think I would love this place if I was a kid, because you can go up to the dessert case and ogle the choices before returning to your table to order.

yay."}
{"text":"If you had told me last week that I would be giving a cafe in Gilbert five stars I would have told you you're crazy.  Folks, YOU CRAZY!!

I was not expecting to be wowed by the unassuming uptown Romeo's Euro Cafe in Gilbert's little downtown district.  But it delivered and outdid itself.  

After the painfully hard decision based on the huge and extensive menu, I ordered the Avocado Feta Pita ($7) and was BLOWN away by the taste. The inside of the pita revealed a sauteed melange of grilled turkey, avocado, feta and a special dressing.  I'm a huge fan of avocado, so I had an inkling I might like this - but I was a bit skeptical of the sauted part of this.  That's a bit too decadent and rich for my tastes. 

But I didn't care.  That's how freaking good this pita was.  I'm a dude and don't have hips or anything, but if bigger hips were a consequence for this, LAY IT ON BABY!!  

Was it authentic Greek?  Not at all.  I would consider it more New American, with Mediterranean influences.

It didn't stop there though.  My fellow eating partner ordered the Corinthian salad ($11), which looked mighty attractive I might add - and I don't care for salads at all.   It was gigantic and came appointed with grilled chicken, artichoke, hearts of palm, red peppers, mushroom, feat and capers in a Italian dressing.   Sounds pretty pedestrian until you see the size of the presentation and the veggies used (marinated mushrooms, for example).  

Dessert was just as incredible.  That's what you first notice when you walk in the door, btw - the big glass counter full of freshly baked desserts - from cheesecakes to tarts, you name it they probably have it.   The apple strudel was a rather large portion, flaky and not too sweet.  But the runaway winner (that even the server agreed on) was the caramel kiss cheesecake - caramel marbled with dark chocolate.  The texture and taste outdid even the Cheesecake Factory. 

While lunch was pretty cheap and basically consists of pitas, burgers, subs and salads, the dinner menu is larger (chicken, seafood, Greek plates and pasta) and seems to run a bit higher at $15 - $20 for entrees.

The space itself lives up to its name with marble tabletops and wrought iron chairs.   It feels very Euro and very cafe inside - with a decidedly boutique feel.  While it's not overly lady-like in here, it would be kind of uncomfortable for a casual everyday Joe used to steakhouses and burger joints. 

Good service despite the busy and brisk lunch time crowd.  Romeo's Euro Cafe is really out of the way for me but definitely worth going out of my way for.  I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Apparently she is everyone's supervisor!!!

I walk in to try some awesome desserts because Romeos has some high reviews online, only to find some woman screaming at an employee for being 30 minutes late. And it wasn't normal why are you late screaming, it was I am your God kind of screaming. She said word for word; \"I am your supervisor!!! Your supervisor!!! Supervisor!!! After Romeo and after so and so, there is me!!! Me!!! So where are you gonna be???\" Not sure what she meant but I had to say something and no matter how much I told her how inappropriate this was to do in front of your guests her only response was I didn't see you standing there. As if that was relevant. You could hear her even after shutting the doors. I try food places for a living and I for sure will never try this place because of the lack of conduct and behavioral skills that is common sense to most people. I'm sorry Romeo, that supervisor needs to be stopped.

Update: spoke to the owner and made him aware of the situation. Bully managers should be stopped. He's a nice guy and seems to be way more suited as management then that crazy supervisor. Five stars because of how he took care of everything, and when I try the food because I will give them another chance, I'll write a separate review."}
{"text":"I've been going to Euro Cafe for years and have always been a fan. The food is fantastic and the portions are very healthy. The Gyro platter is my favorite choice along with the Hot Chips.  Chef Romeo shops daily for fresh vegetables and looks for local foods. Save room for desert for sure, they are dynamite!"}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes YUM and yes!
Eat here - you'll get what I'm talking about. 
Yet another gem in downtown Gilbert. LOVING the outcropping of awesomes spots we're getting here!
Fiance and I were starving and lazy and searched high and low for a place we felt like eating at. Settled here in this little cafe tucked away in the historical building. 
We walk in, and I'm instantly captivated by all the cool trinkets and things for sale in the enterence of the cafe. 
OO SHINEY!
We were seated in a 2-top next to the kitchen in front of an endless row of wine bottles. 
Well if you're suggesting!
I had a a red, fiance had a white. We asked our waiter for suggestions and got plenty of them. Helpful ones to boot!
I ordered the Monte Cristo (which just proves my unbridled hunger, since I do not like ham), and other half got the chicken omega. 
Both were phenomenal! I would have them again and again, if there weren't 43 other things I want to try on that Holy Grail of a menu. 
And a side note - the waiters were so awesome and friendly. My fiance was impressed when after our plates were cleared, a waiter who wasn't even helping us asked how his chicken omega was. Very observant. 
He then proceeded to tell us that they use salty foods such as capers and artichoke hearts in place of salt on all the dishes. 
Which of course, mandated dessert. 
That my friends, is a WHOLE OTHER gushing review. 
Bottom line: eat here. It will improve your life."}
{"text":"Hot night in Gilbert.  Who wants to cook?

DS and I decided to venture up the street and try the Euro Cafe - a teeny tiny little place tucked into the corner of the Heritage Court which, incidently, is kind of a neat little building itself.

We walked in and I thought - this is the place I read about? When you walk in, your first inclination is that it is like a soda and dessert place - but the hostess assured me that they did indeed have a dinner menu.

And a delightful one full of surprises!

DS, despite the heat, had to try the Shellfish Tortellini. It came with choice of soup or salad and he went for the soup (ok, i know - his Bubba taught him to eat and drink hot when it is hot, cold when it is cold - but seriously ;).  It was a spicy vegetable soup that was so tasty, he only allowed his mother who was picking up the tab to have one spoonful.  It was a light veggie broth with a nice hand of spice but not so overwhelming that you would not have enjoyed the veggies in it - most places either underspice and it is bland or are so heavy-handed that you can't taste anything else.  Chef obviously has a good sense of when to stop adding things to the broth!

The Shellfish Tortellini was wonderful.  It came with a very light cream sauce that had just a hint of wine, not much.  The tortellini were tossed with chunks of water chestnuts, almonds, peas, capers, and red peppers.  And loads of shrimp with scallops.  DS gave it a thumbs up and brought home just enough for his lunch the next day.  Hmmm.....wonder who taught him that trick :)

I wanted a little less so I ordered a Gyro and a small dinner salad.  The small salad was nice - mixed greens, a strip of pepper, a slice of cuke. It was not much for the price and I am not sure I would go that route again.  Nice, but I think it was overpriced.

The gyro, on the other hand, made up for the salad.  Let's start by saying I am part Turkish and come from Pittsburgh, where there is a gyro shop on every corner.  I may not know much about agave nectar but I know gyros.  And I had the most pleasant surprise when I discovered -  drum roll please - that Euro does not use standard gyro meat.  See, if you eat gyros, you realize that restaurants typically buy the meat on the spit so there is a consistency from gyro to gyro.  Euro's Chef, however, missed that lesson and decided to make his own. OMG.  I am so ready to divorce DH and throw myself at the chef  It is a delightful blend of ground lamb and beat with spices, then formed into thin long patties that are grilled.  Again, OMG.  They are so good. I, unfortunately, had dreams of leftover gyro for lunch the next day but those dreams died quickly as I could not help myself as I ate the entire thing.

If you love lamb, you have to try the gyro in some form here.

When we left, we couldn't help ourselves and picked up a German Chocolate brownie to go.  Meh, that was not as impressive.  I got the feeling it had been in the case for a while as it had that \"fridge\" taste to it.  It consisted of a fudge-type brownie with nuts (I am a cake brownie girl myself but I could forgive that) that was so dense and rich that we could only eat it in small pieces over the next two days. Yeow.  A little death by chocolate.  It was topped with some white layer (I am a baker but I have no idea what the heck it was), then coconut on top of that.  I expected a more traditional GC brownie, complete with some rich caramel/pecan/coconut layer.  So the GC brownie was okay but I think I hoped for more. I will definitely try another dessert next trip in and see if it is more to my liking.

So follow the signs and find your way into the Cafe and discover a great little secret in Gilbert!"}
{"text":"Walking into this place I had no idea what I was headed into but that it was a hole in the wall spot.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The menu had a lot of options and being that I like Greek food I understood the menu.  I saw a few people that were confused with the menu but I say \"give it a shot\"

The portions were also surprising as they were huge and we could have shared our dishes.  Food tasted great.  I had the feta Cheese Gyro.  I was warned it was very heavy and it sure was.  Loved it.  loved all the flavors of it.  The food was great for my family's palate.

The desserts are also amazing.  I had no room for them this time but shall be back for some of it in the next week or two.  

They were short on help and service was slow but we did not mind as it was a leisure Sunday meal for us.  Service was friendly and I felt that they did care about us and our business.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"My my... I've been a fan of Romeo's restaurants and related places for years as they've moved about the Valley, and they are just superb. Su. Perb.

Big portions of quality food, friendly staff, and the desserts... gah... I've spent many evenings in torment because in spite of being too full from dinner I could not pass up that dessert case. But if I'm going to suffer, this is how I want to do it.

They also do a special wine pairing night that I have not had the pleasure of trying, but I hear is a lot of fun and remains on my To Do list."}
{"text":"Alright folks, here it is - the one bad review of Romeo's.  Maybe I went on an off night, who knows, but I was definitely far from impressed.

The menu is massive - there are probably 100+ things to choose from.  Be prepared to spend a good amount of time sorting through the menu and trying to decide what to get.  Keep in mind that the entrees are quite large - you'll have plenty of food left over.

Anyway, we started with the Greek Skins (potato skins with gyro meat, feta, and some tzatziki-like sauce).  These were the best part of our meal.  They weren't amazing, but they were definitely enjoyable.  We then each got our entrees - I opted for Paella Barcelona (all kinds of meat - various seafood, sausage, etc. in a red sauce over brown rice) and she got a chicken dish that had a whole bunch of veggies with it (sorry folks, I don't remember what it was called).  My dish was okay but really could've been a lot better - the red sauce wasn't nearly as flavorful as it could/should have been.  Her dish was uhhh...in a word, bland.  There was a minimal amount of flavor to everything.  The veggies just tasted like steamed veggies and the chicken was almost completely flavorless.  The sauce that the veggies and chicken were in didn't help anything - nothing had much flavor at all.  Then I remembered each of our entrees was $20 and that made me even less happy.

We decided to take a chance on dessert and were pleasantly surprised with that.  They have a *massive* dessert selection - there are probably 20-30 different things to choose from.  There are cakes, bars, tarts, truffles, you name it.  Dessert is cool because you can walk up to the front area and take a look at everything in the display cases to see what looks good.  We had a hard time deciding, but went with the chocolate-covered cookie dough, chocolate-covered macaroon, and the double truffle bar (a dark chocolate and orange bar with Grand Marnier).  The bar was alright, although I thought the crust was really dry and didn't have much flavor (the display said it had a hazelnut crust but I didn't taste a hint of hazelnut).  The chocolate-covered macaroon was better, although macaroons aren't really my thing so it wasn't that amazing for me.  She loved it though.  Then there was the chocolate-covered cookie dough...oh man.  Sooooo good.  And cheap too - the chocolate-covered cookie dough was only $2 or so.

Anyway, the mediocre quality and moderately high price of the entrees are the reason Romeo's gets two stars.  I'm still planning on going back though for dessert sometimes - they have some really awesome-looking cakes that I just have to try :)"}
{"text":"They don't make substitutions, actually they won't even leave off a piece of cheese because as the waiter told me

\"The menu is exactly as the chef wants it.\"
when I replied I had food allergies I was given a smug response 
\"No, we don't do substitutions.\"
again I asked if I could have something without cheese. 
He said \"no\" and walked away from the table.

Then some fussy lady walked over and told me very loudly  \"no substitutions!\"

I walked out embarrassed. The staff are rude, obnoxious and classless."}
{"text":"this place saved the night!

for my birthday my boyfriend was putting together an evening with our friends. we'd drink some wine, have some tasty goodness, and just have a lot of fun. he called up Postino's East the Tuesday before the night out and made a reservation for 8 people at 7pm. all set right? WRONG. when we arrived at 7pm we were notified that they did not in fact have our reservation and the place was packed so it'd be a 1.5 hour wait. wth? no bueno :(. a friend suggested we try the Euro Cafe at the end of the street. i'm really glad we did!

Euro Cafe was exceptionally nice and was able to put together a couple of tables for the group (including a baby). service was extremely friendly and their selection of wines and desserts was fantastic! i ordered the \"Morning After\" cake and couldn't believe how delicious it was! apparently the white cake was soaked in sangria and included white chocolate, chocolate granache, and this strawberry chutney that had the most perfect strawberry flavor. loved it!

thank you for saving the birthday evening, Euro Cafe! i'll be back to try all those desserts in the case ASAP :)"}
{"text":"purchased 2 desserts to go - both had a freezer burn taste to them so we took them back (with not even a bite out of them...just tasted the white chocolate shavings on top). Waitress said \"oh, you just have to eat around the chocolate shavings - the cake is actually really good.\" Ummm...no thanks. Don't think I should have to do that for a $6 slice of cake! Asked for a refund and was told \"only the owners can do that and they are not in tonight.\"  Refund was made the next day, however it was for the wrong amount. Guess they felt the need to charge us a processing fee for wanting a refund. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Always received great service and a quiet, intimate atmosphere. I went there last week to celebrate finding out my husband and I were having a boy as our first child, and by some strange fate our server Jason recommended us his favorite wine, Blue Eyed Boy. We thought the irony was so cute we bought a $75 bottle, and plan to open it the day our son is born..... Thanks for the memories!"}
{"text":"This place was a really great find. I love the ambiance. It's fun and it reminds me of the San Francisco Bay Area coffee shops. Although they have good coffee drinks I was very impressed by the huge dinner menu. I was impressed by the quality of the dishes they are very gourmet but at the same time they are very generous on their portions and it's totally worth it.  I love the desserts too. I am coming back."}
{"text":"this place is weird but awesome. A little on the \"heavy bank roll\" side but you get good grub for sure. The decor is bizarre and you sit at patio tables inside that are small. You can almost count on no one under the age of 30 being there except for the hostess' but who cares right? you are just trying to get your eat and drink on. I got some killer pasta dish. There's a million things on the menu that have very hip upscale names that I cant remember so Ill call it how I saw it.....noodles with some green sauce and meat in it. Money in the bank."}
{"text":"I wish I could tell you about the food here, but unfortunately I didn't get to taste it. Came here with a friend who is vegan because there were many items on the menu that looked vegan-friendly with a minor modification. We sat down, I ordered a Coke, and we looked through the entire encyclopedia of a menu.

My friend settled on the Eggplant Oscar without cheese. Upon ordering, the poor server sheepishly informed us that the chef does not make ANY modifications to the dishes. I'm sorry, what? He offered to check anyway and we said \"Please do, because otherwise we will need to go somewhere else.\" He responded \"That's probably what will happen then.\" He came back and confirmed the chef would not leave off the cheese and explained, \"Its really not him, it's the owner's policy. We don't use any salt in the dishes so a lot of the flavor comes from the cheese.\" (Um, OK)

We told the server we'd be going somewhere else and he said, \"Ok I'll bring your check.\" My check?? That's right, I was charged $2.50 for 3 sips of Coke. Completely incredulous, I just paid and left rather than fighting with them.  

After we left, we walked across the street to Liberty Market where my friend ordered a Margherita Pizza without cheese from a kitchen that was happy to accommodate. And it was fantastic."}
{"text":"We ate here last night and had a decent time. The menu was extensive and the portions were large. Two people can split an entree. You do have to wait a bit for your food, so order an appetizer or some wine. Dress is casual.

We did hear of a five course tasting menu they offer on thursdays. For 25 dollars you get 5 courses to try and if you want wine pairing it is 8 bucks. Yes, it is with each course! Something we will have to try next time."}
{"text":"What a treasure.. have not eaten here in a long time.. but it is always good.. love the feta fries.. Rome will come out and talk the customers, friendly, the type of place you want to see in every neighborhood.. the waiter Raymond was outstanding.. Everyone is in a good mood when they are Romeo's! you gotta try it if you haven't, and go back if you forgot what a great dinning experience is.."}
{"text":"I had a great time @ Romeo's Euro Cafe for his 3rd Tuesday, 3 wine pairing courses which included a salad, a main dish & the dessert that even impressed me, all for $30
   I recommend doing this experience, we had a great time. The ambiance, the people combined with good food and wine was like having dinner with friends. We walked in as a two top but left as part of a large group that filled this little cafe. I am looking forward to next month!"}
{"text":"man, i wish this place wasn't all the way in gilbert. it is so beyond good food, i can't explain it.

they've moved from the mesa location after like 20 years or something, and their customers followed.

it's mediterranean style that is best described as a fusion of Greek (lots of kalamata olives, capers, feta, gyro meat), MIddle Eastern (a yogurt sauce similar to tsaziki, pita sandwiches) and italian (pastas, seafood) and it's all served in huge portions.

be warned, the owner/chef will not, under any cirsumstances, take changes or substitutions to any dish. trust me, i worked here, he' snot kidding, and you'll only piss of your server and the owner for pressing for it.

the rest. also includes a coffee bar/fresh dessert bar, and the cakes and tarts and pies are made in house, fresh daily. i recommend the baklava cheescake, to die for. dishes range in price from $6 for a sandwich (pita, and even burgers) to $18 for the pasta dinner dishes. whatever you get it's worth it! they also do wine pairing dinners for like $40 a person.

this place is unique and the food is fantastic.they have a ton of wines and lots of import beers and a full bar. would def make a good date place."}
{"text":"Great food!!!! We could not go beyond the starters. So good and all of them are great. We tried the potato lamb balls...calamari and artichoke hearts and a gyro... All awesome stuff. Must try."}
{"text":"The redeeming quality is wines are 5bucks a glass until 5. Other than that the menu is waaaaaaaaaaay too long! The baklava was not sticky, tasted watery. I had the feta gyros and there was nothing special about it. Service was slow but the waiter was polite."}
{"text":"Came back a second time.  I had to adjust the ratings down one star.  Reading the menu I would expect wonderful mixture of flavors but this seems to be hit and miss with some foods good and some very bland and just ok.

Special ravioli gotten the first visit, both of us height it was wonderful flavors.  The desert was good but extremely rich (1-2 bites is plenty).

This time we tried:
Eggplant Cappicola - the cheese was very fresh (soft), the eggplant changes the dish flavor a lot.  Hubby really liked this, for me it was ok but while I like eggplant it gave this dish a bit of a bitter flavor (something about how the cooked it).  I like bitter it just felt to me like the flavors didn't blend well.

Soup of the day (beef and vegetables) - this was very nice.  Wonderful broth that was not heavy or over flavored.  

Blue cheese Ceaser salad - very small any of blue cheese, salad dressing mostly little olive oil 
Added to the side some gyro meat. This was not the typical gyro meat and neither of us cares for it, it was stronger spiced and softer than typical gyro meat - more like ground beef cooked in flavored broth.

Romeo's Choice Skins - sausage had a nice flavor (mild not spicy) and the sausage onions and peppers were nice together.  Put on top of potato skins with a fair amount of mozzarella cheese on top and sour cream dip to dip not into (so overall a heavy dish).  I liked this dish best but hubby who loves sausage thought it was just ok.

Transylvania Chicken - this was a disappointment.  Reading the description we expected a burst of flavors.  But the chicken was bland, the garlic cloves were very mild, and it tasted like each ingredient was cooked separate then assembled - not like it was cooked together as one dish.  No flavor stacking or profile - just separate items.  Not a dish I would get again.  It was a good portion - 3 chicken breasts.  

Prices were decent - about $65 out the door for 2 appetizers, an entree, a salad with meat, and two non alcoholic drinks.  

Sorry to say we won't be coming back again as there are other places we enjoy more."}
{"text":"Note: I did not eat there but I find it necessary to report the following:

During the week of October 21 2013, several colleagues where my husband work got very sick after eating there. As of today, 3 have been to the hospital, 4 others have had some gastric problems. One group ate on Tuesday and almost all of them missed work due to illness."}
{"text":"Beware of this restaurant if you have any food allergies. They refused to make ANY changes to the menu items regardless of my food allergies (I asked for one of the salads without tomatoes and cabbage because I'm allergic to them). The waitress interrupted me to say, \"We don't make any changes to our menu items, no substitutions or subtractions.\" Even after I explained that it was due to food allergies, she wouldn't budge. 
This policy isn't noted anywhere on the menu or in the restaurant either so I had no idea until I was blindsided by it while trying to order. Needless to say, I will not be giving them any future business."}
{"text":"This was on my 'To Try' list forever.  My wife and I finally got around to going and I was pleasantly surprised.  As soon as you enter, there is a tiny little gift shop.  Quaint, but not what I'm looking for in a restaurant.  Service was quick and polite.  We didn't wait too long for our food to arrive, and our drinks were always full.

I got the Greek Salad, and I wasn't disappointed.  Strange, the salad didn't come with any leaves (i.e. lettuce, spinach, etc..)  It was more of a humongous plate of finely chopped vegetables in an outstanding oil-based dressing.

Next time I go, I want to try one of their Gyros... They looked amazing!"}
{"text":"I have a hard time reconciling 'made fresh' with the a hard policy of 'no substitutions'.  If everything is made fresh then what's the big deal about leaving onion, mushrooms, cheese or anything else out?  What this says to me is that in reality the food is all pre-made and reheated when ordered, regardless of what the staff/menu says.

I ate at Romeo's once and only once.  The food was sub-par at best and very overpriced for the lackluster quality.  The appetizer we had looked and tasted like boxed pasta microwaved with a lump of cheese, the entrees were horrid - cold, totally lacking flavor and style, the service was some of the worst I have received anywhere, including fast food joints.  Then there's the menu itself - way, way too large and varried to be able to offer any kind of real quality.  They need to pare it down to a single page of exceptional dishes and then they might be worth it - if they can manage to cook to order and get over their self-righteous attitude.

I have to whole-heartedly agree with an earlier review - call Gordon Ramsay!  He would be absolutely horrified.

Gilbert has some truly amazing food to be had, however, Romeo's is not it.  Instead take your money to Flancer's, Joe's BBQ, The Farmhouse (breakfast and lunch only - but wow, what a breakfast it is), Liberty Market, Joe's Farmhouse Grill and truly enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"Great lunch today at this place. Had the grilled Eggplant salad for appetizer we split and which was really tasty. The Balsamic made the dish. Wife had Feta Gyro which she loved. I had the Lemon Cilantro linguine which was really good as well. Our first time here and won't be our last. Glad to know about this place."}
{"text":"Love this quaint family owned place. Chef owned. This may not be place for 6 kids and fast service but it is for a nice quiet quality adult meal, exp their wines and desserts."}
{"text":"5 star service but the food was drowning in sauce. What should have been the star of the show, chicken, eggplant or even burger,  was lost in an ocean and then covered with cheese. I expected a greater level of European fineness Romeo. The other tables salads looked so much better."}
{"text":"I always have a good experience when I come here. The staff is always friendly and I always order the Chicken Tropical Pita. Sometimes the service could be a little faster, but I always am happy when I leave"}
{"text":"The food was good, but not great. If you must try it you need to order to go because the service is horrible.
I met up late with a group of friends who had made reservations for 7pm. When I joined them at 7:45pm they were just being seated. It took the waiter 15 min to get us all waters & just went downhill from there. We could never get the waiters attention. Once the food was ordered it did come out within a reasonable time. I only ate about 1/4 of mine and was planning on taking the rest home. It took us about 30 min to get the waiters attention to bring our checks. (It seemed he was the only person waiting tables in the restaurant, which, considering the size of the restaurant and the fact that we were there on a Friday night was unacceptable). I asked him to box up my meal. After he ran our credit cards I asked for my food. He apologized for forgetting, went to the back to get it, and then came back to apologize that they had thrown the food away. I really didn't want to wait any longer at the restaurant, so I requested a gift card or a gift certificate, which the waiter said he would get for me. Then he came back stating that they couldn't do that for me, but would make half the meal I had and put it in a to-go box. So, I had to wait another 10 min (as if I hadn't waited long enough), to get the food I paid for before I could leave. And, possibly the worst part is our party was over 6 and so a 20% gratuity was included on the bill. I am glad I didn't get a gift certificate because I do not want to go here again. Much better options in the area in terms of food quality and service."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the Best Restaurant in Gilbert AZ and perhaps in the upper top ten of the whole Phoenix AZ area. We attended a special dinner with the Chef Romeo and his wife, owners and operators. He talked about his background and love for the best food ever in the area. Among the menu as Vasco de Gama farfala pasta and shrimp with a very tasty sauce, Spanikopita lightly deep fried cheese balls, mixed salad and a pork dish, with orange chocolate cake for desert. Wonderfully and Lovingly Prepared. PS if you want a taco or pita stay away. If you want some of the best in Euro cooking come here."}
{"text":"First visit was wonderful! Great food, very solid service and nice ambiance... and they take reservations. It is a small place so call ahead and be a bit flexible. Best new place I have tried in a long time!"}
{"text":"Right in the neighborhood. You can stop in and eat a meal with great service, nice ambiance, and cute high school girls who will kindly make sure you are as comfortable as possible. The menu isn't enormous which I appreciate. So many restaurants make the mistake of packing everything they've ever made onto the menu to appear like they're doing more. But personally I rather see just a few items to choose from that are done extremely well. Romeo's has a few things, done well. So good for them. Plus it makes things for my indecisive self much easier. If you were wondering I got the Monte Karlo, and it was delicious."}
{"text":"OK REALLY!!!! If your restaurant has to charge .50 cents for a few onions and 1.50 for a side of dressing, it's time to close the doors. First and last visit. This place is definitely not in it for over the top customer service. I felt like I was a burden eating there. If you want a wonderful gyro, go to George's. He knows how to treat his customers.  I was going to buy a whole cake after eating, but after the up-charge NO THANKS!!!!!!  Will not be back. These people do not care whether you eat there or not."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed in the food at Romeos! We had lunch there today, and as always the food was fabulous! The restaurant was busy, as it was a Sunday AND Mothers Day. The service was just o'kay- nothing spectacular there - which is why I cannot in good conscience give 5 stars today."}
{"text":"A wonderful little discovery! I am new to the Gilbert area and was looking for a good place to eat before going to a movie. My friend and I stumbled upon Romeo's and were delighted. The service was prompt and courteous, the food excellent and reasonable and the ambiance very pleasant. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"We've been to this small restaurant about 6 times, and the last 2 visits were disaster! The food is great and the menu is huge, but the service, on a scale of 1 to 10, has become about a minus 4. For a couple, things seemed to go well. But if yours is a party of 4 or more, forget it! Especially if you'd like a drink or some wine. The waiter (Doug, a totally disorganized wise-ass from Queens) for our last (and I most certainly mean that literally!) visit took about 25 minutes to open the bottle of wine and make & serve cocktails. Then there was another long wait for salad, yet another one for the entrees, and a prolonged wait for the bill, punctuated by much arm waving trying to get his attention. We blew 3 hours here, most of which was spent in frustration.

Food: 9
Menu: 9
Atmosphere: 6
Service: -4 and falling

We'll never go back..."}
{"text":"My daughter found this restaurant by reading a review from Yelp.  We went here for dessert this evening after eating dinner at a different restaurant. You can gain weight just looking at the displays of yummy cakes cookies, tarts and candies.  I couldn't believe how big the dinner menu was. I know I will be back to try a real meal in the near future. Even though we had to wait about 10 minute because this place was packed it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Wow...and not it a good way.  Let me begin by saying that I have never written a review about anything, but our experience was so weird, that I can not resist.  Two of my friends and I were going out to dinner after a meeting at work.  Since they are both from the other side of town, I recommended Euro Café.  I have been going there since the original location first opened.  Since the move to Gilbert, the service has gotten slower.  However, since we weren't in a hurry, I didn't think it would be an issue.
In the beginning, our waiter was fine.  He had no personality, but the service was okay.  After the usual long wait for the food, the waiter came out with two of our dinners.  He informed my other friend that he had put in the wrong order for her and hers would be coming. He was very matter-of-fact and unapologetic.  He did not offer her the food they had made by mistake, which she would have taken. My friend then had to wait another 10-15 minutes for her food.  During dinner, we joked about how the waiter would handle the check.  My friend assumed the waiter would, in some way, try to compensate for the long wait.  After dinner, we each had a dessert and the waiter brought the checks.  My friend was honestly surprised that the waiter did not even deduct the $2 dessert from her tab.  Of course, it was funny for us because she was completely shocked.  Based on the waiter's general demeanor, my other friend and I were not terribly surprised.  After a couple attempts at flagging down our waiter, things got uncomfortable.
My friend, who handled herself quite well, I must say, told the waiter very nicely that she was a little surprised to see that he had not taken anything off her tab.  His response: \"What do you mean?  I fixed the problem.\" 
My friend: \"No, you corrected your mistake, but I still needed to wait another 15 minutes for my food.\" She explained that her family owns a restaurant and she was also a server and that she just found it odd that he thought the situation was handled well.  She explained that she would have taken something off the check.
Waiter: \"We are not in the habit of giving away free food.\"
My friend: \"I think I should speak with the manager.\"
Waiter: \"Good luck tracking her down.\" Yes, he really said that, and walked away.
My friend asked the waitress walking by to get the manager.  The manager came over.  I could tell she felt badly, but she also laughed.  She said she could understand why my friend was upset, but that she knew the waiter didn't mean it to come off like that. She explained that it takes a little while to get his personality.  In my opinion, that is not a good quality in a server.
Bottom line, the food was not worth the hassle; there are too many other placed to eat that have significantly better service.   I was embarrassed for recommending the restaurant and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"This has been on my \"to do\" list for about a year and half, about the time I got to AZ.  We walked in on a Thursday night about 6pm and we were asked if we had reservations, we did not but we got the last table available.  The place is very small, much smaller that any of the pictures look.  A minute after we opened the menu, which is huge, our server told us they were having a event going and were having long times, food is coming out a hour to a hour and half, and every thing is made fresh.  We could of left but did not.  I liked that she told us, I hate sitting for a half hour for a salad and wonder why it was taking so long.

We started with a app of pastry stuffed with asparagus, cheese and nuts, with ranch dressing dipping sauce.  It was good, never had anything like it before but the ranch dressing did not pair well.  Next was soup and salad.  My husband had the pork veg soup, it was kinda bland.  I had the house salad, fresh and flavorful, it came with a creamy feta dressing.  I do not like feta cheese, I scraped most of it off and then with just a touch on each bite it was good.  If I had kept all the dressing it would of been too strong for me.  

Now the main course, large portions.  My husband had the Pie aha.  First when he ordered it our server told us it was not traditional but their version.  This had large shrimp, scallops, chicken, rice in a broth that was very spicy, not India spicy but with rosemary,thyme, lots of flavor.  He very much liked it.  I had bow tie pasta with asparagus, crab, shrimp, mushrooms, garlic in a white wine sauce. OMG!!!! SO GOOD.  I ate till I was full and put my fork down, pickted it up ate some more and pushed my dish to the end of the table and thank goodness our server was there in a second and asked if I wanted a box.  
Children, it is ok not to clean your plate, no matter what your mother told you, not good to stuff your self but defiantly box it up and take it home.  The next day, warmed it in the micro and it was just as good, no disappointment.  

Defiantly going back."}
{"text":"I wish there was a three and a half. I'm actually torn on how I feel about this place. Some things on the menu are the BEST, and some are a miss. 

Absolutely the best and biggest Gyro, I've ever had. I've ordered their Stuffed Gyro Platter and their regular Gyro, both were awesome! If you have a picky kid, leave them at home, they refuse to leave out an ingredient or substitute an ingredient. Service is hit or miss. They always seem to be packed and under-staffed. One server for like the entire place?? It's insane. They don't use salt, why I don't know, so some things come out bland, like their deep fried spinach appetizer ball (don't know the actual name). But then other appetizers are so good, we fight over them.

Menu has a lot of variety and servings are good size. It can be pricey though. I'll go back, but not during busy lunch or dinner hours."}
{"text":"I love Romeo's!!! I've been going to his restaurants for over 20 years and have never been disappointed. Whether it's a romantic dinner or a casual lunch, he never disappoints. I had a business lunch appointment there last week and had the Corinthian Salad. I had plenty of left overs for lunch the next day and what was so impressive to me was the perfect amount and combination of ingredients to last to the very last bite! Usually you have a plateful of lettuce but I was happily noshing feta, mushrooms, roasted peppers, olives, artichoke hearts and capers.  Ummm, now I'm hungry!!!"}
{"text":"I went out with my family in downtown Gilbert in search of a place we never tried before. This place popped up so we decided to give it a try.

It's inside a little shopping plaza and seems small until you walk inside. The front area has a little shop and and a giant dessert case!!

We finally sat down and looked at the menus. If you love a lot of choices, this is the place for you. They have a lot of Greek foods and other foods as well.

I got the baked feta as an appetizer which had bell peppers, garlic, olive oil, olives and onions on top. It was absolutely fantastic! Definitely worth a try. I also got the tortellini with crab and white wine sauce. This dish was a prefect mix of the cream and crab together. It also came with a side of soup which was scrumptious. The pieces of beef int he soup were delectable. 

The prices were a little high but all the food was great quality. I would have given this place more stars but the service was extremely slow. Luckily we had nowhere to be but if you were in a rush, this is not the place to go. It's more of a place you can relax and share stories for hours.

So go try some Greek cuisine!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times....love the food and the variety is awesome.  If you want freshly made entrees go here...I really enjoy the peppers spanaki  and the dill fritters...the desserts are also amazing.  The owners definitely know their business!"}
{"text":"I HAVE BEEN GOING TO EURO CAFE FOR OVER 15YRS but after today I will never return!  I have never been treated soooo rudely in my entire life! The waitress was GREAT- it was Mr. Romeo himself.  I was invited by a family member to lunch along with my mother.  Mr Romeo participates in program for business which gives vouchers for trade. On these vouchers in states DINE IN ONLY.  My siser was given these vouchers as a bonus from work. We used the value of the vouchers plus we purchased dessert. When it was time to pay the waitress informed us that we can only use these for TAKE OUT-We showed her that it says DINE IN ONLY-so she went to get permission. THIS IS WHERE IT GETS GOOD! Mr Romeo is by no means a little man-so when he enters a room people look. He walks to our table that is surrounded by other guests and says \"LETS NOT DO THIS AGAIN!\"   \"Next time its for take out only, When i'm not here some waitresses may allow this but when it comes to fri night-I need the money!\"  \"I can't keep doing this,,so please help me ou here!\"  We sat there like 3 little kids that just got scolded for stealing!! Everyone was watching and listening-we were mortified!  It's Simple MR. ROMEO-IFYOU DO NOT WANT TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM THEN GET OUT-DO NOT HUMILATE YOUR GUESTS.  I WILL BE LETTING A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW HOW WE WERE TREATED. FYI-You could have handled this in such a better way!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and have always loved the food. The first time I ordered the Corsican sub which was delicious (think French bread+meat sauce+ sausage+pepperoni+ cheese) what's not to like? The food came out fast, was hot and the portions were large. The waiter was wonderful and very attentive. We ended dinner with a slice of cake called the cafe euro cake(?) or something like that. It was basically a chocolate Kahlua cake and was amazing! 

The second time I came here just for the desserts. They have a beautiful dessert counter with an array of delectable sweets from truffles to cookies to pies to tarts and cakes with rather interesting names (satin bondage anyone?). We ordered a couple of different desserts (few different slices of cake, espresso truffles, chocolate chip cookies and a pecan pie bar). The truffles, cake and cookies were excellent but the pecan pie bar was clawingly sweet and tasted sort of freezer burned, which was a bit of a let down. Still love their food and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"An interesting place theme-wise - quaint, crowded. As the name suggests, european in both look and feel. A bit fussy somehow. Huge menu. I really liked the pasta salad I ordered - huge portion as previously mentioned. However afterwards I couldn't help thinking, damn, I could do this myself at home! 

It inspired me to explore vinagrettes in general and eat more vegetables which is a good thing. And I was right about being able to make the dressings. BTW, walmart has this new thing called a multi-mixer which is great for making (and storing) your own vinagrettes at home. Check out epicurious. But I digress. 

To wrap up, huge menu, ok to good food, mostly high prices especially on dessert items. I took home the peanut butter cheesecake but was not impressed with it. Plus it was about $6 a slice. The case definitely beckons but I wouldn't fall to temptation there again.

Also notably, the wait staff was slow, unresponsive and not particularly friendly even though there was only one other couple in the whole restaurant. Maybe they've been told to be that way in line with the European theme??? just kidding but it does make one wonder..."}
{"text":"After all of these years- still amazing! I've been ordering the tortellini feta salad for years and it still does not disappoint. Gyro platter is fantastic. The best part is their dessert case. Recommend the Dangerous Dilemma and The Morning After. Great names, fabulous taste. Made from scratch and truly delicious. Excellent selection of wines. Perfect for date night."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and delicious treats!  Comfortable seating....classy.  Met with a new neighbor there.  Gilbert is so real."}
{"text":"We haven't been back in a long time and decided to give it another try. I had the Dacia pocket sub and it was delicious! My wife had the seafood pasta with shrimp and calamari. It was ok. Not worth $18 but decent. We had the peanut butter brownie and cherry whiskey chocolate cake for dessert. Both were amazing! So moist and rich. Service was friendly but drinks were way overpriced! $8 for a well gin/tonic! $7 for a well vodka/soda. End of story, great menu, lots of great choices, Just drink elsewhere first. Everything on Gilbert road is packed and this place was dead... granted they face they back alley but I think they need to revive the place with better pricing and happy hour. Their HH ends at 5pm. Just my suggestion."}
{"text":"Was there last night for the first time. Thankfully we got there early, since they were very understaffed. The waiter did a good job, dispite the fact that he was dealing with around 10 tables. The menu is vast. When my wife asked for a slight change (having mushrooms omitted from her dish) it seemd like a major deal. The waiter said, \"The Chef dosen't like to make changes to his cooking\"....Are you kidding me? How hard is it not to add mushrooms?. After asking the Chef, he agreed to our request. I read other reviews that had the same complaint. They need to be more accommodating!!!! The food was \"OK\"......but wasn't \"5\" star by any means. Not likely to return to this place."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this place after reading all the positive reviews and also seeing their extensive menu. Upon arriving, we were surprised to see just how small this place was (the pictures make it look bigger) and also surprised to see several leaks from the ceiling. Many tables were not available to be used because there were giant buckets at or near them catching water that fell from the ceiling (we had a storm a day before). Kind of off putting but we decided to stay and give it a try anyway. The husband decided to have a gyro since his logic told him that a euro cafe should have the best gyros. The waitress assured him that it would be the best gyro he has ever had. I opted for the pork molise which was pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon with roasted garlic, caramelized onions, apricot and cherry glaze with horseradish mashed potatoes.  We were informed by the waitress that there are no changes to any items on their menu which was fine with us. However, I think its ridiculous that they are completely unwilling to compromise in the case of food allergies. As a restaurant, I feel they have an obligation to do that. Anyways, the salad that came before my meal was good thanks to the feta dressing. It was very good dressing and my husband was disappointed when he got his gyro and it didn't have that feta dressing much less any feta for that matter. Feta is a key component of a gyro I always thought. he also said that the yogurt sauce didn't have any flavor.  Correct me if I am wrong but isn't tiziki sauce supposed to be present on gyros? Needless to say, this was not the best gyro the hub had ever had and he informed me that we make better ones at home using roast beef and ranch dressing. Haha. As for my meal, it was ok. But honestly, it tasted like something I have made at home out of the crock pot. I'm sorry but when I go to a restaurant, I expect to be wowed and to have a meal that I don't feel like I could replicate at home. Anyways, I am all about second chances so if someone wanted to go here, I would go but I don't know if it had enough potential for me to go back on my own."}
{"text":"Quite a disappointment. Service was extremely slow and... odd. Food was really overpriced for the quality. I think the ravioli I had was from a freezer pack. This was nothing I couldn't have easily made from home. Overall, an expensive lesson in eating at Romeo's. Won't happen again.

Update: leftovers were inedible due to incredible amounts of oil."}
{"text":"5 stars? How about 6? 6.5?

We had such an amazing experience here. The menu was massive but delicious. The service was fantastic. The deserts were mouthwatering. I can't say enough.

The hubski and I went with a few friends last weekend. Lucas was our waiter and I swear I have never had better service in my life! My friend and I both ordered the spankophillo, which is a cross between spanakopita and pizza. Pictures will be posted shortly. Lucas advised us that the dish is very large and maybe we should split it (at the risk of lowering his tip by lowering the overall bill). We decided to get our own anyway. All meals came with soup or salad. The soup of the day was cream of asparagus, which I ordered. Perfect. The asparagus was obviously grilled before being creamed in the soup, and there was a smoky flavor to it. You could tell that it was made there and not just out of a bag like some places. It was also not microwaved.

My main dish arrived. Lucas was right- it was ginormous. I stick by my decision to have my own. After my delicious soup, I only ate one small slice of the spankophilla in the restaurant. I would love to tell you that this monstrosity re-heats well, but I didn't get that far. Maybe I'll be a little less impatient next time. What can I say? I am impatient. It tastes better warm than hot. Its also great cold.

Spankofilla? We've been spanked!

My friend had the salad with her meal and she loved the yogurt dressing. He husband ordered the gyros and was told by our waiter that it is \"the best sandwich in the country\". And it was.
Hubski ordered a tuna melt. If I thought my dish was huge... it came on a big Italian roll with slices of tomato and melted provolone cheese. It was $7. For this size and quality, we would have paid twice that.

For dessert, because I saved room, I had a piece of the \"Morning After\" cake. It is a white sponge cake soaked in sangria... amazing. Our friends had the tiramisu, which was out of this world.
On top of that, while hubski was drinking coffee, Lucas the magnificent was watching which kind of sugar he was using, so when he refilled the coffee, he brought a whole container of just raw sugar. He checked on us regularly, but was not on top of us. He had plenty of suggestions but was not in our faces, and he was just overall the best waiter I have ever had.

Eight thumbs up. We'll be there again soon."}
{"text":"We had been dining at Romeo's Euro Cafe for 2 years now. Each time we select new dishes and leave with our taste buds atingle. From the appetizers that are unique and the perfect starters to the most wonderful main dishes that one can dream of. We love the service and gladly recommend Romeo's to all."}
{"text":"Delicious! Can't wait to go back! Everyone in our group agreed. Loved the appetizer our waiter suggested. Service was great! And not to mention the dessert case! We ended our meal with chocolate covered cookie dough!"}
{"text":"A bit disappointed - wine selection is good however if you are searching for real euro - this isn't the place - staff are very nice however food is better at a great hole in the wall deli......"}
{"text":"Again... another 5 stars for Romeo's. I really cannot say much that has not been said before but I will comment that I have been to Romeo's 5 or 6 times and I will be a loyal Romeo's customer for years to come. I positively crave their stuffed mushrooms (Think feta, artichoke hearts, and capers...the most amazing thing ever) and I rarely get beyond their pasta dishes to try anything else (I will have to though after reading of their Gyro's) not to mention that the salads are amazing (how do you make a salad amazing I wonder?). However, I do have to say that those of you that did not try dessert are very very sad people indeed because this is one place where the pain (and you will be in pain after one of their entree's) is well worth it. The cakes are out of this world... Satin Bondage, dangerous dilemma, intoxicated love, rhapsody in blush... I choose no favorites. They are all amazing. If you are in the least bit adventurous you must try one of these... or if your a girl go with a few friends, each get a different one, and share. You will not regret the calories."}
{"text":"I went to Romeo's for the \"Taste of Romeo's Euro Cafe Table for 10\" on
Thursdays.  This was my first time and I was impressed!  Romeo himself sits with you while you enjoy a sampling of an appetizer, salad, 2 entrees and a dessert.  The wine sampling was also a delight.  All their food is made fresh (they don't own a microwave or heat lamps) and Romeo and his wife are passionate about the food they make.  We had the Spicy Lamb potato ball, antipasto salad, tortellini gianni and sherry cranberry pork and for dessert a variation of baklava.  Everything was amazingly good and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"BE ADVISED:  A group of 4 employees where I work and some vendors that took them to The Euro Cafe in dowtown Gilbert were diagnosed with food poisoning just last week.  
A few have been treated at the hospital, while others are home fighting through it.   VERY SERIOUS - the proper authorities were notified and are collecting data of everyone affected for the department of health."}
{"text":"Food was OK. Menu far to large, but the food was still made fresh. Atmosphere bland. Two wine lists, So be careful that u don't miss the good stuff. Calamari was very nicely done. Everything else was just ok."}
{"text":"Depending on what you order, Romeo's fluctuates from 4 to 5 stars and is truly a neighborhood gem!  Was there on a Tuesday evening, very quiet, good for us, bad for them.  Their entrance and parking is in the rear, lots of room.  
The four of us ordered one appetizer and three entrees, which come with soup or salad.  As my yelpers warned me about the dinner salad being small and average we ordered soup of the day,  white bean and pork, which tasted wonderful but was just tepid, not hot.  
Our appetizer as per the menu:  (Mushrooms Meteora:
Baked button mushroom caps filled with feta cheese,
capers, artichoke hearts and dill.)  Very tasty, a bit tart, lots more shredded artichoke than mushrooms. 3 - 3.5 stars.
My wife had for her entree as per the menu: (Salmon De Provance:
Salmon fillet baked in parchment paper with, pea pods, scallions, red peppers, asparagus, onions in a caper tomato clam sauce).  She rated it a 4.5 stars.
Our friends ordered as per the menu:  (Seafood Santorini:
Shrimp, calamari, capers, scallions, red peppers, basil pear tomatoes, kalamata olives with feta cheese finish).  They had been here many times and always order this dish which I assume they would rate it 4.5 -5 stars.
And for me, a dish I shall never forget or even get tired of, whose flavor and goodness took me by surprise, the wonderous  and abundant pork tenderloin, as per the menu: 
(Pork Molise
Grilled pork tenderloin, wrapped in bacon, roasted
garlic,horseradish mashed potatoes, honey caramelized
onions and apricot - dark cherry sauce).  The potatoes were delightfully creamy,  mixed with small potato chunks and a mild garlic/horseradish flavor, accompanied by caramelized onions made with red wine I believe, and a fruity sauce that perfectly complemented this dish.  How can dark red ripe cherries cooked with apricots and some wine be any worse than a 5!  I give this dish a 5++ stars.
It will be very very difficult not to order this dish when I return but their menu I'm sure hold more treasures.  This is truly fine dining."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Very rich, with is not a complaint, but a fact.  Waitress was clearly new and didn't know the dishes.  She could use a manager to help her. Service and atmosphere is always unique and this place is an asset to Gilbert.  Would recommend you try it.  Guaranteed you won't find something similar on a menu anywhere."}
{"text":"We have been fans of Romeo's Euro Cafe for a very long time. We followed him from when he had his restaurant over by the Fiesta Mall, then they disappeared (or so we thought). We were ecstatic when we found him in Gilbert! 

We keep going back. We take friends there, we go alone, we take family....we share the deliciousness with everyone we love. 

I've had pretty much every chicken or  shrimp dish he makes. Also, the eggplant dishes are to die for! Edice's Feta Shrimp, Andalusian Chicken, the house salad with feta dressing!!! Uh oh. I'll have to go back now! The Sunflower Beef is just amazing...
I really haven't found a dish I haven't liked. 

Did I mention, you need to save room for dessert, too!! Ahhhhhhhh, heavenly!"}
{"text":"Six stars if i could! Food is so so amazing and flavorful! Been here with friends many times and the servers were super attentive, fun, and welcoming."}
{"text":"The first time I was ever here was with my book club. It is a little small for a group our size but that's my only complaint. I have been there a few times since then and always received good service and great food.  The desserts are AMAZING! This is one of my go to spots in Gilbert for a solo lunch or dinner.  I would give it 5 starts but I was reminded that just because I thought my waitress was really hot that didn't mean they get an extra star ; )"}
{"text":"I almost want to give this place less than 5 stars just to be different. But I really can't. 

Its strength lies in (1) its massive number of menu selections, and (2) the undeniably high quality of the food. 

I'd honestly have to give its ambiance no more than 3 stars, because it's nothing out of the ordinary. And its location in Gilbert isn't a big hit with me, though the friend I dined with who lives 2 minutes away would beg to differ. But there's no question: the great food and menu selections here overwhelm all other factors to earn my 5. Gilbertians, be proud."}
{"text":"Expensive, long wait & just ok food."}
{"text":"Delicious
Pork Molise
Grilled pork tender loin, wrapped in bacon, roasted garlic, horseradish mashed potatoes, honey caramelized onions and apricot - dark cherry sauce."}
{"text":"We were out and about trying a new place and were not expecting much. This place is amazing. Quaint and cozy, has a nice bistro vibe. Waiter was one of the best. He was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Talkative but not intrusive. Now the food..... once we finally decided on 2 out of a million options we were not disappointed! We had the pastrami cream pita and ravioli salad and both were absolutely amazing!  We ended with the German chocolate brownie because you can not leave without grabbing something from the dessert bar! It was heavenly. We can't wait to come back with the moms!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places! 

The portions are HUGE and, as you can see from the images posted, the menu is too! Pretty much everything has a Mediterranean ingredient of some sort: shrimp, eggplant, artichoke, lamb, feta, garlic, tomatoes, olives... what's not to love!?

Personally, I stick with appetizers: the Spicy Lamb Potatoes, which I like to call \"lamb balls\" because it makes me giggle... these large egg shaped croquettes of potato, gyros meat, herbs and spices are served with yogurt sauce. They are so big, I usually wind up bringing 2 or 3 home! PLUS, I have a plan: I have to save room for dessert because the baklava cheesecake is fricking AWESOME!!! (so is the caramel cheesecake) 

I still want to try the wine pairing dinners. They're held monthly on a Monday and at $45, seem to be a steal! Looks like they pick a label and build a four course meal around it! Check out some of the past menus: http://www.eurocafe.com/calendar.html"}
{"text":"My wife and I tried the Euro Cafe this weekend. Place is small and quaint with a huge dessert display case in the entrance and looks amazing! We were greeted by friendly hostess and servers and were excited to give it a try.

Received our menus. All I can say is WOW -- overwhelming. Although many items seemed to share similar ingredients, it's extremely difficult to do that large of a menu well -- especially in such a small restaurant. 

We got even more nervous when we saw one of the staff walk right through the dining area with a large bag of frozen stuffed pasta to the kitchen. This happened again later with something else, but I couldn't see what was in the bag. Not sure if they are making trips to the grocery store or they have a walk-in in a different area of the building, but it wasn't very professional and was an indicator of what was to come. 

Anyways, the food. Well it looked nice and was a large portion but it went downhill from there. Both entrees seemed like a confusing jumble of flavors and textures overwhelmed by the different marinated/flavored ingredients that made up the dishes. In both cases, the protein (shrimp, chicken) tasted like they were boiled or poached and had little flavor. 

Anyways, maybe we just ordered the wrong things. But to be honest I won't take the chance again to find the better ones. Maybe the chef/owner needs to reduce his menu by 50-75% and concentrate on what works well. Its pretty hard to do 100 menu items (my estimate) without compromising."}
{"text":"I come here often. This was actually my third time this week. I brought my daughter who wanted to order the feta pasta salad but was afraid she wasn't going to like the mustard vinigarette. She hates mustard. I assured her she would like it but she insisted on asking for a different kind of dressing and the server told her no. So i asked if he could bring out a teaspoon of the mustard vinigarette so she could taste it. The server told me he would have to ring it in and i would be charged for a side of vinigarette. I told him no and told him we will need a few minutes to decide if we even wanted to stay here or go somewhere else to eat. He comes back and asks if we are staying. I was surprised that he didn't seem to care less. I asked again if he was sure she couldn't try just a small taste because I love it and I'm sure my daughter will, too. He said he will ask but his name is not Romeo and doesn't own the restaurant. Wow, that was rude. He comes back with a tiny amount and she likes it. 

A few minutes later a grouchy old man comes out from the kitchen and made some kind of loud scene about spending only $30 and stomps out of the restaurant. I never would've noticed him if he didnt have that little temper tantrum. I was spending $30 so it may have been referring to me. Then I notice the servers going outside. So I looked up info about this place. Sure enough, the man that made the scene is none other than Romeo himself. 

It's too bad, I dined there often and I fly 150-300 people a day into this city and recommended this place to people frequently since its hidden from all the other restaurants in downtown Gilbert. Well, I can guarantee you that will never happen again. 

Sorry Euro Cafe, don't bite the hands that feed you."}
{"text":"Nope. Nope. Just, nope.

I wanted to like this place. The menu looked good (even though it is waaaaayyyy too big). Our server was pleasant enough and made wine suggestions. And they put cucumber in the water, which is awesome because I love cucumber in my water. So this is where the two stars came from.

The food, however, is terrible. We started with the Eggplant Cappicola. It came out 22 minutes after we ordered it and I was flummoxed as to what I was supposed to do with these things. They really didn't have any flavor at all and my husband said his portion was cold in the middle. I ate about two bites of mine. 

I ordered the Shrimp Giouvetsi on Fillo. When the waiter set this mess in front of me, I was a little appalled. The fillo dough was a soggy mess on the bottom and the edges were ridiculously thick. The shrimp/tomato/artichoke concoction in the center of it tasted weird. Too much rosemary. Like, tree branches of rosemary. It was not OK.

My husband ordered the Chicken Astoria. I tried a couple of the baby corns and the sauce wasn't bad but, like mine, the presentation was awful. Now, don't get me wrong, if food tastes good, you could bring it to me in any presentation and I wouldn't scoff but none of this tasted GOOD. Some of it was OK but none of it was GOOD. Scratch that, the side salad was good. So, there's that.

I won't be come back here. $58 for a terrible appetizer, 2 sub-par entrees, and one glass of wine (I drank water) is not worth the money. And it took 90 minutes to get through this horrid meal. Not OK."}
{"text":"I now see my daughter and I are not the only ones to receive bad service here.  So sad since this place had the potential of being a real find. My daughter and I went here on a girls day out. We were at first excited to see the display case full of beautiful looking desserts. I had creme brulee. It was pretty good. My daughter ordered this chocolate shell tart with what was described as a white chocolate filling. It did not taste like white chocolate at all and it actually had the texture of Crisco shortening. Yes shortening!! Not at all what you want in a dessert.My daughter took one bite and put it down. I tasted it to see if it really was as bad as she said and I had to agree. No problem. I told my daughter \"I am sure when the server comes back they will let you exchange it\". When the server came back  she only said \"Oh I am sorry you did not like it \" and took it away. She came back with the bill with both desserts on it. She never asked us if we would like to exchange for something else. When I looked at the bill I said my daughter did not like her dessert could she have something else? She said she would have to \"add it to my tickett\". I told her it was not polite for her to ask us to pay for a dessert that clearly she only took one bite of because it was not good. She said it was policy to not take things off the bill just because someon did not like it. So...just like other reviews here I will not be back. If the customer does not like it. They don't like it. If they think you are rude and have terrible manners they won't be back.Your service always has to be as good as your food! If you don't even have good service you have nothing! You lose!
Not a new concept."}
{"text":"Very extensive menu with large selection of wines. Enjoyed gyro feta dill fritters on appetizers. Not very kid friendly...chicken and vegetable plate came with raw carrots, cucumbers, onions, peppercini, and then bell peppers (kids?). Gyro had authentic sliced meat and great pita. Offers a menu sampler deal on Thursdays to explore 2 entrees and 5 wines for $30. Probably a good option."}
{"text":"Excellent service and wine selection.  The menu is expansive, diverse and original.  It definitely has a European flare. And yes, the food is awesome.!.!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't look like much, but the food is wonderful.  I've gone a few times with a women's group of 6-10.  Every single one of us enjoyed our lunch.  The menu is extensive, so takes a few minutes to get through, and then a few more to decide among several tasty-sounding items. 

Last time I ordered the Chicken Tropical pita sandwich.  This had a large piece of chicken topped with Canadian bacon, wrapped up with Swiss cheese and a pineapple slice and coated with a honey dijon dressing.  Yum!  Others ordered the Reuben (also a pita sandwich), Monte Karlo, and a Vegetarian that included artichoke hearts and hearts of palm.   One friend ordered the Antipasto Salad, and the beautiful presentation of it made everyone smile. 

In addition to delicious entrees, the Euro Cafe has a display case of European desserts.  We were all too full to have dessert with lunch . . . but that's why they have to go boxes."}
{"text":"In all fairness, this review reflects their desserts, because that is all that my friend and I ordered while we were here. We had already eaten lunch and just wanted something sweet. I'm pretty sure I had dined here in the past, but I honestly cannot remember what I ordered or what my impression was, so I'm basing it on my most recent experience of the desserts. 

The two of us ordered a strudel, a baklava, and an apricot thing. The strudel was probably our favorite. It was flaky and the filling (not exactly sure what the filing was composed of) was really good. The apricot thing was weird. I don't recommend it unless you really like dried fruit; my friend described it as \"fruit leather\". Lastly, the baklava. We were really excited about the baklava. It was huge. There were so many layers, and the layers were really thick. Well, clearly, we don't know a thing about baklava, because the thick layers should have tipped us off that this would not be a good baklava. There were just sooooo many nuts. It got to be quite overwhelming. The nuts were rather soggy instead of crunchy, and just really took away from enjoying a baklava. So, even though the desserts might look good in the display, they don't always taste so good.

Service was also weird. It wasn't good or bad, just weird. It felt like they were doing things that didn't make sense, but we got our food, our utensils, and our waters, so I guess it was okay.

Last thing: the cucumber in the water wasn't fresh. I really wish they just wouldn't do that."}
{"text":"**********This review is for the gluten free desserts only. ***********

First I'd like to say that I appreciate their awareness of gf, and offer desserts that are labeled as such.  
I bought the white chocolate truffle \"tart\" that has a dark chocolate shell.  Looked absolutely delicious.  My friend took the first bite and made a face.  I tried it, and it tasted like it had been in the freezer for too long, or maybe behind the glass for too many days.  We agreed that it tasted like freezer burn.  I thought it was a shame to go up and ask for my money back.  But I couldn't eat it, and it was $5.75.  The gal said she couldn't give me my money back because I had taken a bite out of it.  So, I got the creme brulee.  She torched the top of it and gave it a nice crispy shell.  Again, looked delicious.  My friend and I both took a spoon full of it, and immediately looked at each other, like - oh my gosh, yuck!  It was so sweet, we could hardly finish eating it.  Terrible.  Now, I have quite a sweet tooth. I can eat sweet and rich desserts when others can't.  So, for me to say that a dessert is too sweet, that is something.  There was no way I was going to take it back up to the gal because it seemed controversial to take the first one back."}
{"text":"Stopped in to place a take out order at 6 PM during the week and there were 2 other tables with guests eating food.  I placed one to-go order. I watched people come in be seated, place their order, and to my surprise and dismay, the groups of people that came even 10 minutes AFTER I placed my order got their food first. Its not that my order was a complicated dish. I flagged down the waitress that took my order and told her I had been waiting for 40 minutes and why was one take-out order taking so long? she shrugged her shoulders and said, \"Its always like this.\" I told her I wanted to talk to the manager, and she said there wasn't one there. I asked her to check on my order, and she did and said, its almost done (it wasn't).  It took one hour and seven minutes until I got dinner!!!  I left a message for the manager to call, and I did not get a return call.  I stopped by to talk to the manager, and was told they were in a meeting. I gave it one last try and stopped by, and the manager sent the message that he was busy in the kitchen. I asked the waitress how long would he be?  She asked him and came back with the message, \"When I am done.\"  How unfortunate that the manager does not care about customer service. I'd rather go to a restaurant with leadership that cares."}
{"text":"Been here four times and really enjoy the variety on the menu. This is a small restaurant (charming) with a kitchen that amazes me. I do not know how they prepare such a wide range of food in the space. I've enjoyed appetizers, gyros, and their pork molise. We found everything to be tasty and served with a nice presentation. Always found the waitstaff to be knowledgeable and helpful. Just a great spot for an enjoyable taste before going to our favourite theater, the Hale. Plenty of parking around back."}
{"text":"Ooo, I felt so *cool* just stepping through the door of Romeo's Euro Cafe. Romeo's serves an impressive variety of drinks and foods from all over Europe and America, with emphasis on the Mediterranean region. All in a quaint yet trendy atmosphere. 

The Undici Undici Fine Art Coffeehouse is located adjacent to the Euro Caf and offers more than 20 different types of coffees, as well as Euro's fine dessert menu. They also feature live local music and have a gift shop. See how cool this place is?

Try the Undici Sunrise with freshly squeezed orange juice, ice cream, vanilla syrup and whipped cream, or the Intoxicated Love cake, pairing white, milk, and dark chocolates with Grand Marnier, Kahlua and Jack Daniels. Some of the \"real\" food choices are just OK, but the desserts and specialty drinks are to die for!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place and finally did. The interior is great! Cool mellow setting. 

We only got take out so can't speak for service.

The food was amazing! The menu is huge too! We got the Roasted Almond Tortellini dish. SO FREAKING GOOD! Sauce is creamy and rich and perfecto.

Our friends got a similar tortellini dish and also looked amazing. 

Very creative dishes and lots of variety. 

Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful and I hate to see when someone says something negative.  People should read the menu before ordering.  The menu clearly states NO CHANGES WILL BE MADE  (If this does not suit you then get up and leave) Too bad people cannot understand PLAIN ENGLISH. 

YOU 'ROCK' ROMEO!!"}
{"text":"This has become a favorite after only a few visits. Fortunately I have had the opportunity to see many dishes with \"tablemates,\" and much of what I have seen and eaten is extraordinary. The menu is large with lots of choices to confuse. So far, I haven't seen anyone disappointed.

The only thing keeping it from being Five Stars for me is that the service can and often is a little slow, with various excuses given. Additionally, on a couple of occasions I have felt cramped in by the other tables being so close. 

The food, in both preparation and appearance here is FIRST RATE and while their extensive menu is too big to have sampled even a small percentage of it, somehow I feel it wouldn't be there (on the menu) if it wasn't going to be terrific.

A great little \"find,\" that has already been found by many."}
{"text":"I would say I'm in love with their menu but the service...while good..was painfully slow and the restaurant wasn't that busy..I guess on his defense he was the only server on a Sunday afternoon.  They kind of have late hours on the weekends for earlybirds like us.  Will comeback for the soup and gyro platter...desserts were also excellent!"}
{"text":"Thanks to some fabulous Yelp reviews, M and I decided to eat here last night.  I had some idea about how massive the menu is, but had no idea it was like a book!  We intended on going there for a salad, but were enticed by other food.  

The parking lot near the building offers plenty of spots.  You enter through the little gift shop area where you get a preview of the dessert counter.  

We ordered the Mushroom Meteora which is mushrooms stuffed with artichoke, capers and feta cheese.  OMG!  So good.  I enjoyed a staff suggested glass of Pinot Grigio, M had their passion fruit iced tea.  I also ordered the Whoo-Ahh iced drink which is kind of like Starbuck's Caramel Macchiato.  It was soooo good!  Caramel, chocolate, espresso, oh my!  They do serve beer and lots of wine options.

For dinner I had the Mostacciolli Secundo which was sauteed onion, artichoke and penne pasta in a creamy ricotta sauce covered in mozzarella.  M had the gyro plate that came with a HUGE portion of gyro meat that was absolutely delish!  

For dessert M had a blended ice drink of chocolate and mint.  I had the chocolate covered cookie dough and regular coffee.  The only reason we had room for dessert is because we stopped eating our entree.  Figured we have it for lunch in the next couple days.  

Warning!  The portion sizes are HUGE!  I didn't listen to the reviews and ended up with so much extra food!  So be prepared!  But DO save room for dessert!  There is TONS of chocolate!  Also, make sure you have plenty of time as the service is slow, but it really lets you enjoy each part of your meal."}
{"text":"We have been going to Euro Cafe for years (old Mesa location too back in the day) for special occasions as well as regular dining.  The food is 5 stars but I am giving it 2 stars after today's service for a special occasion.  Euro Cafe needs to step it up with their wait staff.  

The restaurant was not busy on a Sunday night and the waiter took a while to come over and greet us.  However, there was no hello or greeting when he came over to give us our waters.  He barely spoke or had a personality.  We were there for my mom's bday dinner and ordered a bottle of wine, main courses and dessert.  The waiter never even said Happy Birthday after we told him it was my mom's bday and she was even opening presents (Bday celebration was pretty obvious).  Very disappointed in the effort the waiter did not put forth for a special occasion and barely spoke to us when he waited on us.  

This place is not cheap by any means and I would expect higher quality service for this establishment."}
{"text":"I love this little gem in the heart of Gilbert. Just as a small heads up, if you do not like feta or capers this may want to be a place you avoid because they are on 80% of the food and they do not so substitutions. I ordered one of the shrimp dishes and it was awesome however they didn't clean the artichokes perfectly and I got a few chokes in the middle. The whole party I went with had awesome meals and the feta salad dressing is amazing!!! I am not a huge fan of dressing and I loved it. Most definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I've been going here since it was in Mesa accross from MCC. I haven't been here is about a year, so I'm not sure if ownership has changed, but the food was not good. Probably last time I will eat there. Sauce was bland and watery and just not good. Seemed like they skimped on the ingredients."}
{"text":"The wait was very long for table and it got worse from there. We sat down and it took awhile to be greeted. Once we ordered the food took FOREVER. I have never waited that long for food and the food was boring. It was flavorless and I felt like I could've made a better meal at home. the restaurant was hot and I left greasy and smelling like the back kitchen. This was my first experience here and definitely my last!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the valley! I'm vegetarian and I've never had a dish there I didn't like. They have a huge menu and a great wine selection. (The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the seating area is somewhat small and they don't do anything special for birthdays.)"}
{"text":"Love this place for times when you are looking for something different than the sea of chain restaurants we have out here. If you get a chance, I recommend the chefs tasting. It's a lot of fun to do with friends, you get to chat with a very interesting guy, you will probably sample some dishes that you might not ordinarily try, and if you pair it with wine, watch out. The wines were nice choices, and I didn't even realize how easily that wine was going down until I realized I was having difficulty walking upright."}
{"text":"Oh Romeo's Romeo's wherefore art though now in Gilbert?

I have loved this place for many many years.  Their pita sandwiches are fabulous.  The house salad with the creamy feta dressing is wonderful.  I'm always in the mood for one of their fabulous lemon tarts.  I've always had decent service there although on a busy night it takes a while for the food to come.  I'm glad they are doing well in Gilbert, but I miss having them down the street in Mesa.  The new space is cleaner, more cafe like with small tables and large windows.  

Of the entrees that I've had there, I\"m partial to Kasseri Chicken, Plaka Chicken, and the Roasted Almond Tortellini.  But hey, find your own favorites, there is  a lot to love at this place.  Portions are pretty big on everything, so come hungry."}
{"text":"First I would like to say that everyone's review on here is so wrong...  This place is expensive and the food is under salted and had no flavor.  The service was by far the worst ive seen in such a small cafe. The waitress, in which remained nameless because she never introduced herself, was rude and presumptuous. Our first impression was trying to walk in a door and her yelling \"go to the front \" . So we started to search for the front of the building.  When we found it they seated us immediately but then did not come back to the table to take our order for 20 min.  When she arrived she was rushing and honestly acted like she didn't want to be a middle aged women waiting tables in Gilbert on a Friday night (cant blame her for this). However be kind, and respectful to your tables and then your tip will be grand.  We waited another 30min for the food to come out and it was underwhelming to say the least. We  thought well maybe the desert is better so we spent another way 13 dollars on desert. The German chocolate brownie was dry,  flavorless and horrible  and the texture was grainy.   Nonetheless we weren't happy and tipped the minimum.  120 dollar bill crappy service and a couple of baths from her filling up the water cup too aggressively and we were ready to run out of this place. Then the waitress screams out the door 5 dollars on a 120 $bill is unexceptable.  Well your service and food was unexceptable.  If you were nice at all and attentive then you would have had a larger tip.  Best of luck-we won't be back  ."}
{"text":"Romeo's Euro Cafe is a small place in downtown Gilbert, on the bottom south floor of what appears to be an old office building. I had never been, and met a friend for lunch who goes as a staple.

The interior was quaint, and the walls lined with wines. I wonder how they can have good wine though, given that it was so very hot in there? The menu was vast, and had all types of European fare, from Greek to Italian, seafood to vegetarian.

We opted to split the Asparagus puffs, which were heavenly goodness wrapped in filo. I had an iced chai, which I found to be underwhelming. The waiter was fantastic, always making sure that our beverage glasses were full, and timed our meal appropriately. 

The house salad dressing is great. My pal even took a bottle home. I ordered the manicotti marinara for my entrée. The dish was molten, as to be expected. The ricotta filling was uber cheesy, and the sauce not too acidic. I enjoyed it. But, for $15 for the two small filled pasta shells, it seemed a bit pricey. But who can put a price on good food, really?

After our meal, we both hit the bakery. I got 2 chocolate covered cookie dough balls, 2 apricot finger thingies, and a chocolate truffle bar. All were amazing!

I would eat here again. I'll bet it looks great in here at night."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible!! I asked for my dressing on the side and they refused to comply they said they must put the dressing on. I was appalled. I then proceeded to wait nearly an hour for a Greek salad with NO meat. When I asked about the wait time I was told this is an average amount of time and I need to be patient. When my food did come out it was not the correct order. There was no apology. Just a heads up a Greek salad does not come with lettuce."}
{"text":"My fiance and i decided to have our wedding reception at Romeo's Cafe....Great Choice!!
Melodie was a pleasure to work with and her advice regarding our food choices proved to be right on point.
The evening went perfectly and our guests loved all of the food. The party room is situated in a cool area with seating outside as well as inside.
We made the perfect choice for a small reception of 18 people. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Shortly before Christmas, my partner and I decided to get away from the crowds at the north end of Gilbert Rd. and dine at Romeos Euro Cafe. There was no wait, and we immediately seated at a cozy table near the window. The ambiance in the restaurant is quaint, and the decor is inviting. The server was prompt and attentive. 

My partner order a dish that came with mashed potatoes. When he asked for butter, the server told him there would be a charge of 50 cents for butter. At first, we thought he was joking.  Once we realized he was serious, we asked to speak to the manager about the butter charge, and she confirmed that we would have to pay 50 cents for butter to apply on the mashed potatoes or bread that came with the meal.  When we pointed out that our meals came up to $64, and they would be losing 2 customers over 50 cents, she was not concerned, and maintained that they needed to charge the fee for butter. I ordered a pasta and shrimp dish, which was bland. 

I stopped going to Euro Cafe when it was on Longmore, in Mesa, because of the chef's refusal to modify dishes by omitting cheese, and now I will no longer go to this restaurant because of a ridiculous charge for butter.  If you go, BYOB- bring your own butter."}
{"text":"I have driven by here multiple times and always wanted to stop in. We finally had the bright idea to come in and check it out.

The menu is HUGE. I mean HUGE. It took me about 20 minutes to go through it (much to the chagrin of our server, I'm sure). If you are panning to come in, take a look at the menu prior to coming in to narrow down your choices prior to taking a seat, trust me.

The service was great, the atmosphere is very cool and it definitely has a euro vibe to it. The menu is a little on the pricey side for what's being offered.

There had a few good veggie options...but to me meatless is not always healthy. Most everything here is covered in cheese or sauce or is deep fried, which quite literally stresses me out because I don't prefer those options. Yes, I know I'm being a bit dramatic. :)

I ended up with stuffed peppers. It has brown rice and veggies covered in cheese and baked. Decent. But holy cheese!

I may stop in and give it another shot in the future, but for now it's checked off of my list."}
{"text":"The good: They have a large menu with tempting descriptions.

The bad: if you go on a group prepare to wait, and wait, and wait.

The ugly: we found a maggot on one of the dishes, another got his order all mixed up.

I don't mind that much anymore if a place ENFORCES a group tip, but at least be CONSCIOUS that your working team DOES deserve the tip. For the service and the LOOONG wait we had, it doesn't make much sense to leave more tip."}
{"text":"We've been frequenting Romeo's Euro Cafe for some time now and tonight we celebrated Valentine's Day with a feast fit for kings and queens. The ambiance is lovely, with a definitely European feel to it, lighting is subtle and romantic and the menu is chock full of wonderful creations inspired by various European countries. From Paella to Transylvanian style chicken and especially the Marco Polo ravioli, every item is meant to please your palate. Portions are just perfectly sized and the wine selection is well above average. Service was pleasant and courteous and if you're lucky you might even run into Romeo, the owner and master chef extraordinaire. Oh, so I don't forget, the dessert assortment is out of this world. Great job, Romeo!"}
{"text":"This medium size restaurant with a display of baked goods as you walk in is a gem in the Gilbert Food District.  We arrive at the right time and was seated immediately.  We order their Feta Dill Fritters, Mediterranean Stuff Gyro and Ravioli Calavo.  Everything was season so well and flavorful.  Cooked to perfection, the meat was so moist and melted in your mouth.  The Feta House dressing and yogurt sauce is delicious too.  Our server Patrick was very helpful and kind enough to point us to 2 of the dishes we ordered.  I'm already anticipating my next visit here, can't wait to come back for more."}
{"text":"I had the most amazing food at Romeo's Euro Cafe tonight. I wish I could tell you what I ordered but the owner was creating a new menu for his specials every other Tuesday for $33.00 and had brought me a dish. The ribs were falling off the bone.  The mustard potato salad had so much flavor and the consistency was perfect.  The large bean salad with marinara sauce was delicious.  A picture is worth a thousand words so check it out.  I would highly recommend this to all my family and friends.  You could pick anything randomly off the menu and you will love it."}
{"text":"We returned to Euro cafe, over a year after the kitchen smoke filled experience.  As we walked up my wife said that if it was smokey again we would just leave. Luckily the kitchen vent was working correctly and we enjoyed our favorite dishes.  The waiter was excellent as well.  Happy to be back to an old favorite.  The Feta Gyro is a must try."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here on a Saturday afternoon. Food was fantastic, service great.  I even learned a few things, like feta dressing is a lot better than feta cheese and gyros meat is a lot more than just something carved off a cone ;the gyros were fantastic.
Definitely coming back. Everything was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Went here last night on a friend's recommendation...so glad we did.  The food was absolutely delicious! Since we like to do \"Meatless Mondays\", this was the perfect place.  There were  quite a bit of options and we both went with the Vegetarian Pita...so delicious! And how can you go wrong when you're surrounded by wine?! The only reason I didn't give them five stars is because the service was rather slow, but we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice place. They lemon tart was very good but the white chocolate tart my wife ordered was old and not good. Our meal was good but the service was slow."}
{"text":"While the meal I had was authentic and fresh (more onions than I'd like), I had to settle for the menu item because there are NO SUBSTITUTIONS. I am a diner who believes I should get exactly what I want when ordering at a restaurant because I'm using my hard earned money to pay for it. Romeos believes his dishes are created to absolute perfection and any deviation from this would ruin the taste of the dish. That is fine, but I didn't find perfection with the menu so I will probably not return for a meal. However, the desserts are delectable. Amazing selection. If I return it will be for dessert only."}
{"text":"This is a great little cafe tucked into a corner of downtown Gilbert. The menu is... eclectic, and even overwhelmingly large. However, everything I have had here has been delicious, and I have heard nothing but good from friends about this place as well. I can't wait to try something from their desert case, I haven't made it that far yet though since their portions can be quite generous. They have a good wine selection, and the bloody mary I had here was not bad either. Also their creamy house feta dressing is quite delicious as well. We often drive by this place and say \"man we need to eat there again\" on our way to some of the trendier Gilbert spots, but I really do need to get in here more often. There are so many more things on that massive menu that I want to try."}
{"text":"Lets just say that I don't eat here often enough. Its small, its boutique-y, but damn is it good. 

I've had several menu items over the last couple of years I've stuffed my face here, literally, if its something you like and its on the menu, it will be good. If its something you are unsure of and its on the menu, chances are it will be good. If you like Mediterranean/Greek food even a little bit, you will love this place. The deserts are crafted well while also being plentiful, and the wine defines this place as legit.

I am conflicted about this place. Its not particularly close to where I live, and they don't do reservations, its small, and you sometimes have to wait a while if its a busy night. However, in order to manage their quality and manage their costs, I see why they would benefit from having a small restaurant, and in some regard it adds to the exclusivity of its existence.

Alright, enough with that bullshit, just go there and enjoy an awesome meal."}
{"text":"Very delicious baked goods and coffee! Tons of menu items to choose from! Went for dinner with my family ( 9 of us) and everyone really liked what they got!!"}
{"text":"As it turns out, India Palace is closed on Sundays and as a result, we googled another alternative dining venue that would provide a good Yelping opportunity...Hence this review...

Full marks MUST be given to this place since the ambiance, the service, the fare, and the wine were not in any way lacking.  With a focus on dishes named for Greek cities but presented to the rest of the world, the menu had twists on classic Mediterranean favorites.  Upon arriving, you'll pass a dessert box that may alter your initial intention to have something savoury.  I advise you to simply save room because the additional view of the multitude of worldly wines welcome wavering wanting with wonderous whites and well balanced reds.  Wow.  

I had  dish named Salonika Chicken which featured a beur- blanc with orange liquor sauce....WHAT?  Yum is what.  Creative and charmingly presented, I spent about 3 hours in this place remembering how to pass a Sunday afternoon with great conversation, super delicious food, and the best of company.  Don't we rush enough in this life?  I value that there was not a hint of hurry here while our server was attentive and happy and helpful.  Others in the restaurant were also very happy and huddled in conversation that was muted by some low playing music with a non Euro theme.  If this place piped in the music of Italy, France, and Germany...I think we would truly have to add another star!  I really LOVE it here and this will be my new hide-out...
Ooooopsss!  now I've told all of you!  Oh well.  Something so good should be Yelped.  I think the placwe is charming mostly and just the excuse I needed to Euro-pose...and you know that I did!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim ... so glad we did!!! Food was amazing!!! Melodie was hilarious and took time to visit with us during our attempt to eat way more dessert than anyone should!!! Definitely recommend the gyro, the cheesecake brownie and the mushroom appetizer!!!"}
{"text":"I work nearby and this is a go to for delicious, consistent food that never disappoints.  The menu is absolutely humungous so you're sure to find something for everyone."}
{"text":"We were visiting Art Intersection on the second floor and the desert case lured us in. Let me say: it did not disappoint!

It was very quaint inside; very moody lighting and beautiful brick walls. Something homey and authentic that a lot of hipster wine-and-dine places try to achieve in Gilbert but don't quite get there.

I have been here twice now and both times were such a great experience.

In the first visit, I got the pastrami cream pita, which was EXCELLENT. I went out of my comfort zone when ordering it and was very pleasantly surprised by the layers of flavor. My only complaint was a bit too much thousand island dressing, but that didn't really affect it much. There was so much creamy/savory/saltiness packed into a little folded pita. Plus, it was filling!

The second time around I ordered a linguini with a black pepper encrusted chicken breast and a mushroom marsala sauce. It came with a salad and bread! It was absolutely divine. I enjoyed every bite! I would have paid 18$ to have just a single noodle. The chicken was tender and the pasta was cooked just right.

Also, it is worth mentioning that you should ALWAYS order the house made chips. No matter what. Trust me on this one! They're to die for.

The deserts are something else. I could probably try anything and love it! Our favorites are Romeo's birthday cake and their mocha brownie. Delicious!

Can't wait to come back here again. Take someone here if you want them to feel special!"}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place, especially after reading all of these great reviews and I was thoroughly disappointed. 

First of all, they request that you do not make any changes to their menu items - which is just nuts to me. I couldn't request that a salad NOT have mushrooms thrown on top for some reason....apparently it's too much trouble? 

Second of all, the one or two things I did find on the menu without mushrooms were salads and one didn't even come with lettuce. So I defaulted to another salad and it came how it came - which was pretty bad. The dressing had no flavor whatsoever, and the salad as a whole was just boring. Iceberg lettuce, red pepper, and artichoke hearts...that's it! 

Now, my coworkers all loved their meals so I may give them another shot, but it's not likely. Any place that doesn't let you modify your order is just not a place I want to go."}
{"text":"My review still isn't a five star.  This is not really a favorite place of my husband's, but he does love the fries and feta sauce.  He is not a sauce person, but with these fries, they are awesome.  

The food this time was much better than the time he and I came with another friend.  The Bacon Subburger looked beautiful and my husband ate the whole thing.  I got one of my normals, which was a feta gyro.  

The restaurant was about 1/3 full, but many tables still opened.  The place was a bit warm and humid, but not terribly uncomfortable.  I was disappointed that the tasty regular water they used to have with the Brita (sp?) filters was not the case anymore.  This is actually the first time I've seen them have the regular water pitchers that other restaurants have, rather than the delicious water they used to have, or have had for over 2 decades.  The water had a not great taste to it.  That was a HUGE disappointment.  This is one of the reasons for the 4 star rating.  

Our server was okay.  He didn't do a bad job, nor a great job.  He was just doing his job.  But, since we don't usually dine in much these days and for the past few years, it's hard for me to say whether this is par for the course now or not.  But, I remember for many years, the servers were so personable and wonderful.  They acted like they really cared about the customers and got to know them, rather than just doing their jobs.

Edice was my very favorite.  Our server did all the things he was supposed to, nothing more, nothing less.  Having well above average service before had me coming more often.  Maybe that's why we haven't come very often either.

It's not enough to have good food.  Because the food remains consistently good, it puts it at a 5 star, even though you cannot change anything to the menu items.  But, that is a standing thing of this restaurant.  However, service and everything else, 3 stars.  Loved the quirkiness of the prior servers that were there for years.  But, maybe that's not what people are doing now.  

We'll be back, but rather take out  more or less.  As others have mentioned, service wasn't super fast, but it wasn't slow either . . . maybe tended a little slower."}
{"text":"This place is what you would call \"quaint\".  has a boutique feel to it.  Hard to find even though it is located in the hot spot of Gilbert (right across the street from Postinos).  The place is small but the food is good and authentic.  The menu is HUGE and overwhelming.  Its really amazing how big their menu is when their kitchen is not the biggest.  I guess you cant say that they have a particular taste or menu other than European.  The dishes are pretty big and hearty and the prices are decent.  Definitely a good restaurant to goto if you want a change of pace and something different then the box restaurants. And the dessert menu/selection is GINORMOUS! and very delish with a big variety from Chocolate, creme brule, carrot cake, cheese cake and they rival that of fancier bakeries.

Pros
-fresh and authentic food
-big selection of food
-good service and knowledgeable staff
-BIG DESSERT MENU
-they have wine tasting nights (call to find out more)

Cons
-small, deff not a good place for big parties
-overwhelming menu
-dessert menu will DESTROY YOUR DIET PLANS"}
{"text":"I went here recently to give it a try! It has always intrigued me. However, I asked to switch out the Focaccia bread for Pita bread with one of their caprese appetizers and the lady gave me a funny look like it was unheard of to make a change. I mentioned that I like soft bread VS. hard bread (just a personal choice) and she said she would ask the chef. They couldn't do it- so I said ok fine I will take whatever it come with. I also noticed on my way out that they charge 50 cents for water cups if you are in the bakery area?  Its illegal to charge for water cups in Arizona! I doubt I would go back.."}
{"text":"Walked here after having dinner at Liberty Market, since I couldn't have any of the desserts offered there.  After the friendly and very helpful female host helped to phone the pastry chef to address my food allergies, I placed my order of a slice of \"Dangerous Dilemma\" and a chocolate-covered walnut strudel and was seated at a two-top next to a window with a view of a parking lot.  I decided to while away the wait on the dessert by looking at the baubles on display by the entrance.  A few moments later, the host notified me that the strudel had cornstarch, so it's a no-no for me, and that  I would not be able to dine inside since I should not have been seated with an \"outside drink.\"  \"Would this be a problem?,\" she asked. I said no, paid for my to-go dessert, and settled on a bench outside the cafe.  While the two forkfuls that I tried of the multi-layered dense cake (cookie crumb bottom layer, dark chocolate fudge cake, white chocolate mousse, another layer of dark chocolate fudge cake, and then topped with raspberry coulis) were delicious, I inadvertently became the meal of ghost mosquitoes (so I had to pack up and leave, yet again).  All because I had a lidded to-go cup of Liberty Market drip house coffee with me.
The $6.54 (tax included) cake slice was tasty (although almost a bit too sweet), and I can't fault someone for following house rules, but I wished my drink could've been overlooked.  (There were only two occupied tables out of 12 to 15 tables.) Heck, I could've ordered a glass of wine, or another cup of coffee, with my dessert had I not been turned away..."}
{"text":"This chic local eatery had a variety of delicious food, excellent service, and a quaint atmosphere that will offer everyone a perfect dining experience. This hidden gem is a new found favorite of mine...can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for well over 10 years. Sometimes once a month and other times every 3 or so months. I have never had a bad meal here. Not even close to average. I've never left without being completely satisfied. I've only had about 1/5th of the items on the menu. All of them are great. Some of my favorites are the Calamari, Chef Salad, Coconut Fried Shrimp, Feta Dill Fritters (are a meal in themselves), Spanaki Balls and Gyros Platter. My 2 top favorites are the Pasta Rustica (love the sausage and shrimp) and the Penna Carbonara ( ask for extra bacon) Oh so yummy.
     I always take about half of what I order home. You really get your moneys worth here. No little dollop of this or squirt of that on your plate. You get a real \"cooked from scratch\" meal made less than 20 feet away. Like any good place, you will wait for that fresh food and it's totally worth it. Enjoy a glass or bottle of wine from their huge wine selection. If your smart you'll take home something from the desert cases and enjoy it later on. 
     The food is wonderful. Period!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them more stars. The thing is I was really excited about this place and it just didn't deliver. The smell outside? AMAZING The menu? So many options (perhaps too many?) I had so many high hopes...
The trouble is as awesome as some of the menu items sound, if you pay attention you begin to realize that they all are using pretty similar flavors. Meanwhile the food was disproportionately SLOW considering the amount of food we ordered and the amount of customers. It took well over an hour to get a pita, some potato skins, and stuffed mushrooms. I won't even get into detail on how long it took to even get our order in or check at the end. Despite interest in trying a few other dishes we won't be back. As the meme says \"Nobody got time for that!\""}
{"text":"When we first found Romeo's we were so happy.  Here was a great place to eat, with good European food, great desserts, good prices and a comfortable atmosphere.  Sometimes they even tempt us with alcohol, like once finding Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock available.  This visit was no exception, though I did not end up with a beer this time.  We had a reservation and were quickly seated.  The water has cucumber in it, which is actually quite nice.  The menu is huge and I know we both try to get something new, but sometimes get a favorite. This day my wife went with a favorite, Athenian Chicken and I tried something new, the Vasco De Gama, an interesting shrimp dish.  We both enjoyed the salad that came as a starter and our mains. With a wonderful dessert case it is hard to resist getting dessert.  There is no dessert menu here, you get up and look at the dessert case to make a choice.  This time we both had cheesecakes, my wife had the Raspberry White Chocolate and I had the Kahlua Frangelico.  Both were excellent, as always.  Service was great and we had another excellent meal."}
{"text":"Wow, we had a wonderful 5 course wine dinner there with Romeo and his lovely wife, Janice, on Thursday evening. Every dish was incredibly delicious, and the wines were spectacular. I have served on our top California wine board for 12 years, and his choices from Sonoma and Napa were all excellent. We plan to return next Thursday evening and bring friends. This is not to miss!"}
{"text":"Came in for dessert with my daughter today, after walking around we stumbled upon this place. We enjoyed a slice of the Dangerous Dilemma, and a chocolate covered cookie dough ball. Dangerous Dilemma was rich, delicious, and decadent. The cookie dough ball was surprisingly amazing as well! Their desserts are all made in house! I would love to give the rest of their food a try."}
{"text":"We had an outstanding dinner. The house cab was really outstanding, the Pork Molise the best pork I've ever had. The Shellfish Tortellini and Greek Salad awesome. Our waitress Annabelle was adorable and helpful and we loved her! This place never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Romeo as usual Fantastic food & outstanding service. Melody WAITED on the 4 of us for my son's Bday dinner. She's as sweet & kind as ever. First time I tried your curry incredible flavors, a delious meal. First time my brothers been in. You have another new customer, he loved what I call Adult Mac N cheese. Son had cranberry pork, his go to FAVORITE. Thx for a very enjoyable evening out. God Bless & Wish u & ur family many more years great success."}
{"text":"A little on the small side as far as table space goes. Friendly staff that are very knowledgeable about the huge menu. Large portion sizes. The food was ok. A little pricey. 2 entrees, 2 waters and one diet coke was $49.00 before the tip. It was just okay, no hurry to go back."}
{"text":"The best lunch and Cafe food in the Euro genre in the Phoenix metro area. Seriously. This place is stellar. Try their basic gyro pita and fall in love. Try their penne carbonara and be transported. Try their Marco Pollo ravioli main dish and be amazed. I've tried all of those plus the Paella (red sauce based, not saffron), Athenian Chicken, and much more. Enjoyed them all.

What's more, the soups and salads are perfect and fresh. (their soups are especially great since they are all one-off creations that always surprise and taste great). And their deserts are rapturous. I go to lots of restaurants in Arizona and your won't find a cafe with a more complete and we'll done Euro menu that wins on literally every dish. 

And everything is a home made, customized and perfectly fresh rendition of each dish. My wife's favorite place. 

And if you're into wine they also have a large cabinet of expertly curated wines.

You won't miss by going here. Honestly."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Great food. Very large portions. Dessert is a real treat. Only complaint is that their bread was stale our last visit. It is usually fantastic. We are regulars."}
{"text":"The food was delicious.
The service was attentive. 
It took almost an hour for our food to be served.  We came on a night when they also served their Prix Menu to a group of at least 10.  Not sure how many but there was a lot of food passing me while I waited for mine.  

Appetizer was a great start:  Spanaki Balls.  They were so good I could just have those with a side of soup.  

 Pork Molise served with small side salad
Bacon wrapped pork loin was yummy with the cherry sauce.  

Ravioli Bolognese served with small side 
salad.  Meat sauce with sausages was flavorable and rich.  

I would've gave this place a 5 stars but I didn't expect the wait to be so long.  

Well have to come back and try other dishes and hope the wait isn't so long."}
{"text":"We decided to try Something new and non-chain, so this hidden gem came up.  Located in downtown Gilbert it's in a charming little retail property.  Tucked away, you might miss it, but the signage is there. 
The menu is massive, with a greek influence but with many other options, so there is something for everyone.  I tried the Gyro pita sandwich and my friend had the Penne Carbonara.  My sandwich was stuffed with yummy gyro meat, and the taste was as I would expect.  Very good!  I tried a bite of my friends carbonara and it was flavor packed.  Both dishes were a good size so you won't leave hungry.  
They do have many options for wine and then some nice deserts in the front case that had us wishing we weren't stuffed.  
It's a small place so not a tone of seating, and the kitchen is practically part of the dinning room, so it might get a little stuffy.  

Service: A
Food: A+
Ambiance: B
Comfort: C (the heat of the kitchen was a bit much.)"}
{"text":"Cute little mom and pop place in Gilbert. The food and service was good. 

Drawbacks.... There is this loud humming noise and they didn't have any music playing so all you hear is humming and other peoples conversation. The atmosphere is cute but the humming and the random conversations you pick up takes way from the quaintness of the place."}
{"text":"First off, you walk into this place and it smells like a European cafe should: competing hints of baking bread, roasting coffee, and various cured meats and cheeses. The wife and I each tried pasta dishes, she the Penne Carbonara and I the Roasted Almond Tortellini. The tortellini were perfectly cooked, and the flavors of the stuffing and the sauce were mild enough while still being hearty and satisfying. We tried the Night Before cake for dessert, which was like an incredibly dense cocoa mousse on a macaroon crust. Definitely as good as it sounds! We will certainly be back, but probably just for coffee and dessert because this place is a bit pricey!"}
{"text":"We had a poor experience with takeout not once, but twice. We really hoped giving the place a second chance would result in better quality food, but no such luck.

The first time around, my husband ordered a bleu roast pocket sub and accidentally received a garden pocket sub. He said it was good, albeit runny. I ordered the tortellini kalypso and for the price, I was underwhelmed with the heaviness of the sauce and overall lack of flavor that so many Italian restaurants seem to screw up.  The two redeeming qualities were dessert and the spanaki balls.

Round number two: My husband ordered the burgersub and said it's fine but slightly over-cooked. I ordered the artichoke salmon, thinking it would be tough to screw that up, but I was wrong. The salmon appeared to be seasoned with herbs of some kind but completely lacked salt. The remainder of the dish was too acidic with the hearts of palm, artichokes, and capers and nothing to balance it, and the white wine cream sauce lacked flavor (salt). Cut to dessert and I get three bites into my tiramisu before discovering a long, curly, black hair. Gross, gross, gross.

I try to keep an open mind with dining establishments but the disappointment in quality of food here is all encompassing, especially for the price."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Incredible. Unique. I adore the food, and as another has said, roasted almond tortellini is my favorite.

Atmosphere is cute and what you'd expect from a privately owned restaurant.  -1 for the seats being quite uncomfy. 

Service is usually great. Mind you, I'm not very picky with service. Just bring my food, fill my drinks occasionally and I'm pleased.  This wasn't the case the last time I went. I took my mother-in-law... And I was actually embarrassed by this waitress. She was rude, didn't offer us the entire options \"a salad with feta dressing, k?!\", and then when my mother in law asked her what desert she would recommend (seriously, make up something If your not sure) she replied with \"you know what, I'm busy!\". My jaw dropped. She followed this with \"I have a table of 12 and I'm the only one here, but everything is good enough.\"  I have never been treated like waiting on me in a restaurant was an inconvenience. 

Romeo should be upset as I was, because this kind of service put a bad taste to the amazing food.


I left 4 stars because my service in the past had never been so bad, and I am a regular who loves the dishes."}
{"text":"I love Romeo's service and food from the minute we walk in til the bill comes!  The hostess Hallee is super sweet and competent!  The server,  Melody,  was extremely knowledgeable!  The wine list is extensive as is the menu and everything we ate was delicious!  I recommend this restaurant to all my friends!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more than 5 start.
My girlfriend and I started with the popcorn calamari. It was cooked perfectly! Light and flaky on the outside, warm and tender in the inside. We both ended up getting the pita. She got the monte Cristo, and I got a chicken and pepper. Both absolutely amazing. Passion fruit tea, perfect. Then to top everyrhing off, peanut butter cheese cake and a lemon tart. Perfect, perfect, and perfect. Small, not a chain, and perfect."}
{"text":"UPDATED REVIEW since June 2015.  After my previous review, Romeo had reached out to apologize.

We stopped by this afternoon after an appointment we had, at about 11:40.  The restaurant was mostly dead; there were maybe 2 other patrons in.  I realize midday isn't exactly a huge draw with all of the other competition, but that's okay.  The first thing I noticed was that the dessert box looked a little empty; every other time I've been there, it's been completely overflowing.

My wife ordered a feta-avocado wrap and I ordered the Gyros Platter.  We've had the gyros platter before so we mostly knew what to expect.  The feta dressing on the side salad was superb as ever; it's one of my favorite things about Romeo's, and has been since the first time we went.  

When the entrees came out, my wife was surprised at hers.  The wrap was solo, no sides, which isn't necessarily bad because the wrap was actually pretty full.  However, she couldn't detect any taste of feta, and barely any turkey; the avocado was really overpowering.  (And that says a lot -- my wife LOVES avocado.  I hate avocado, so I didn't try it).

I shared mine with my 2-year-old son.  One of the first things I noticed was that the ends of the pita were hard, as if they were stale.  The pita was warmed of course, but the crunch wasn't as if it was toasted too much.  Visually they looked fine.  Even my two-year-old complained that it was too hard to each. 

The gyro meat was as good as it has been previously.  Romeo's gyros has a unique flavor profile that I like.  I don't think that they prepare it themselves -- I don't see a spit anywhere in the back -- but it's pretty tasty.  The gyro was nice and thin, and was cooked to a nice crispness.

Now onto our favorite part, the dessert.  We ordered a chocolate-covered cookie dough ball, and a dark chocolate tart.  The cookie dough ball was average; it didn't \"wow\" us like it has in the past.  And the chocolate tart, well....  I think there are two schools of thought about dark chocolate.  One is that it \"not sweet.\"  The other is that it is \"decadent.\"  I'll own up to being of the latter school of thought; this dessert was from the former.  The most surprising thing about the \"dark chocolate tart\" was that it had a layer of peanut butter below the chocolate tart itself.  It was tasty, and neither the PB nor the chocolate dominated the flavor -- but the tart cookie bottom was REALLY crunchy and dry -- again, lending us to believe that it was older.

So even the dessert fell short of our expectations.

Service, too, was lackluster.  He came and retreated as soon as he brought water or whatever.  

Overall, it was not worth the price.  I could imagine us trying a dessert to-go sometime, but I don't think we'll be eating in again.  It's really disappointing to me, too.

From watching things like \"Restaurant Impossible\" and other similar Gordon Ramsay / Robert Irvine shows, I just feel like their menu is too big to do everything well.  Focus on some of the essentials and narrow it down.  I still remember the first time I had \"goat shrimp\" -- shrimp wrapped in bacon stuffed with goat cheese -- and being whisked away to \"this is the best restaurant ever\"-land.  Keep those.  And don't ever get rid of the feta dressing.  But let's figure out how to bring back the awesomeness of the desserts!"}
{"text":"Came here again for Valentine's Day. This place just keeps getting better and better. They were extremely packed but very accommodating, trying to seat us as quickly as possible. The meals did take a little bit longer to come to our tables due to it being a full house, but our server was on top of it, filling our drinks constantly without even having to ask, while we waited. And it was a special occasion being it was VDay, so my hubby and I just enjoyed getting to spend time together. 

Food was fantastic as always. We got the Spanaki balls to start off with. Yum! For entrees, I had to try really hard not to get the Chicken Astoria again, but what to decide on? Everything looked so good! I ended up going with the Tortellini Gianni - cheese filled tortellini, italian sausage, scallions, garlic, mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, marsala cream sauce = delicious!

I can't even remember what my husband got, but he was in heaven as well. And don't let me even start on the dessert...

This place is going to continue to be one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona...by far."}
{"text":"The restaurant was packed, we came to have a dessert there. Fantasy cake piece was extremely slim for the price and lacked flavor. Chocolate nut strudel was made out of phyllo dough and didn't feel like strudel at all, tiny and boring piece."}
{"text":"This is an other gem in Gilbert ... not as hip-and-happening as Postinos, but the food is great with a pan-European approach (everything from Greek to French). The service was very good and certainly not rushed. The wine by the glass selection is extensive and prices are reasonable. This is an excellent choice for 2 or 4 people who want to sit down and talk over a great meal ... my only dig on the pace is its extensive menu. I'd be far happier with fewer choices."}
{"text":"Euro Cafe is shining light of hope for Gilbert AZ and the foodies, comestible connoisseurs and gourmets. Believe it or not there are some in Gilbert who not walk on their knuckles or eat at Oregano's. For those seeking food of high quality and substance, Euro Cafe is your safe harbor. With a large menu of  divine dishes ranging such as the \"Roasted Almond Tortellini\" and \"Andalusian Baked Eggplant\" you will be sure to find something, The cafe also caters to vegetarians. 

Not mentioning the marvelous wine selection, and out of this world dessert menu, I could write a book about how great this place is. The humble setting of the restaurant is immediately over looked when you are in the moment of a \"food-gasm\". 

Bravo Romeo!"}
{"text":"The menu is so extensive and everything looks delicious you may have a hard time deciding what to order. 

Waiter was excellent. The food divine!"}
{"text":"My wife was craving for something different so we decided to try this place. Everything was EXCELLENT!!

Our waitress did an above and beyond service. I'm not really familiar with European dishes - she made a few suggestions and warned us that the dishes are Very, very large. (Me and my wife are small plus we are trying to eat less....). We decided to go for the Paella Barcelona and split it. Oh..it came with a corn chowder soup. 

Our food came and we would not believe it!! Extremely LARGE! We started to go at it and it was very delicious. We took our sweet time depositing it into our tummy...Couldn't save room for desserts...During the meal, we felt like we had our own personal waitress. 

Here is what we thought:
Food -    A+++
Service - A+++
Price -     A+++

I will have some out of towners visiting next month... I'll definitely bring them here!"}
{"text":"Foods great and the portions are huge! Lunch prices aren't bad- especially since you can split almost anything on the menu with someone and still leave stuffed!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and was impressed with the food. Servings were large, decided to take dessert to go. What a shock when I saw how small the almost $8 slice of cheesecake was. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been going to Romeo's for over 10 years...But I do have to contradict some of the reviews...

Large but restrictive menu...65 entrees starting at $14 to $22...
20 Appetizers(that you could eat as your meal) 20 Salads( and no not only 2 come without mushrooms) actually about half do not come with mushrooms(and there are a few salads that you can change)...oh did I mention over 20 pitas and 20 Subs...The key to the bathroom was enforced by the building HOA Romeo's had nothing to do with it...And everytime I go to Romeo's the wait staff is usually very good to me...it does have a different feel and if anything takes too long it is usually due to the Kitchen making everything from scratch...I know many of the people who work here and they are glad to help you out with any questions you may have...Ask Brad bout about wine and he will be able to direct you to something you like...Edice is a sweet old lady she is so caring to her customers...But ordering food here you must be specific in what you want and don't expect to just come in sit down and the food be brought to you in a rush...it is a relaxed sit back and enjoy your food type atmosphere...

And Yes if you go to Europe for the most part they will not make changes to your food...And in a lot of cultures it is actually rude to suggest that they change your food..."}
{"text":"Adorable place in downtown Gilbert! A tad pricy, but worth it since it's not your boring, typical chain. I love huge menus and this one is massive. So many choices. I love pasta with tons of stuff in it and I was happy to see every combo in the world on that menu! My husband got a toasted sub with avocado, pastrami, bacon and swiss and it was the best sandwich he has EVER had! Wine is amazing and several desserts to choose from. Service is kinda slow due to there only being one waiter in the place, but the food was so good, who cares! Come check this place out. I guarantee there is something on this huge menu you will love!"}
{"text":"Where should I start when raving about this fabulous little Euro café? My roomie and I picked Romeo's as a spot on the way home to get takeout gyros. They did not disappoint in that department, as their menu tends to the Mediterranean side of European cuisine. Of course, as we waited for our to-go order, we could not help but drool over the delectable offerings in their pastry case. Impulse struck and we assembled a dessert sampler which included a slice of peanut butter and chocolate cheesecake, an almond brittle, chocolate-dipped cookie dough and caramel/nut tart. They have a lot of little tchotchkes on display made by local artists. I couldn't resist buying a tin sculpture of a weathered gecko playing a guitar... his outstretched tongue resplendant!

As for the food, I can honestly say I was blown away. The gyros were fabulous, the portions of meat were generous and superbly seasoned. The raw veggies were fresh and crunchy. I don't even need to tell you how indulgent the dessert sampler was, but it is clear that the pastries and chocolates here are top notch. And I love the attention to detail spent making fine European-style pastries. This brings back memories of the mouth-watering goodies I encountered growing up in Europe at the local Konditorei. A real treat to visit Romeo's Euro Café... I envision returning soon so that I can enjoy a lovely sit-down meal accompanied by a fine wine picked from their extensive list."}
{"text":"I got the eggplant Oscar, it was super pricey just like most of the entrees here. We had a bad waiter, he was very slow to begin with, we had a relatively big group. He had a very bad memory and wouldn't get my drinks until I had to remind him twice. One of my friends ended up getting a live maggot in their food, she realized after eating half of her dish. The waiter came to take it back in and was later joking about how the maggot was still alive. My other friend had his food delayed by 15 mins after we all had ours and eventually when it came out he got the total wrong order. All along from there or he was involved in a sarcastic banter with that friend of ours until he eventually got the order. Then eventually when it came to desserts, they never came out, we had to go pick up our orders after 20 mins. The waiter never got them out as he was busy with the checks, which took forever. There was some issue with the billing machine, so it took forever & then they charged so much for the gratuity , like 20% it was not professional considering how bad te service was( including the maggot in the food) it was shocking they decided to charge us anyways, irrespective of the maggot. Finally when I asked for the Togo
Box, the waiter said he will box it for me and took it in and never came out with it, I had to ask him for it again. All in all, super-pricey, bad service, small place, unhygienic, there's nothing to go here for again, until they get better!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this small and interesting restaurants. One of us had the caper chicken for $21 it included linguine pasta.it was very tasty .The tossed dinner salad was delicious because of the homemade feta dressing.
A glass of wine is $5 until 5 pm
Our other entry was vasco de gama for $23, shrimp and chicken in curry sauce with some mustard and.  Bow tie pasta.
Little garlic rolls served with the salad yum!
Our waiter Patrick was helpful with the extensive menu choices and efficient and friendly 
Will try some gyros at another date 
Desserts are displayed like a bakery All homemade 
Looked delicious especially the tarts and pecan pie bars with a chocolate layer.
Took 1/2 of each dinner home. Good size portions."}
{"text":"Fabulous food.  Quality meats.  Don't stray from the menu.  Great area to walk around too."}
{"text":"We do the Third Tuesday nearly every month. While I am a fan of several of Romeo's menu items, the fact that he creates a meal to complement the wine is a testament to his magical culinary abilities. That is what keeps us coming back.  If you haven't tried it, you're missing out. 3 courses, 3 wines, $33 every 3d Tuesday. Oh, and if you're just craving a crazy good dessert, come and experience Janis' magic. So many things to die for."}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite in downtown Gilbert. Best Mediterranean you're likely to find this side of the valley. Try the pasta Rustica!"}
{"text":"I will give this place 3 stars for their dessert and wine only.  So many yummy desserts to choose from and it's a very cute little restaurant.  The down side of this restaurant is A) There are way too many items on the menu- leaving little ability to perfect a few good items and B) The food is waaay too rich and/or oily.  Both my husband and I got sick after eating here (on separate occasions).  So needless to say, I don't think I'll be indulging in dinner items here anymore."}
{"text":"I have only had dessrt here so my review needs to be limited to that. Let me just say that there dessert is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! So you walk into this palce that is kinda hidden in a brick building. Upon your entrance you come upon a large display of all sorts of cakes, brownies, cookies, and other delicious goodies. It smells great and looks even better. The biggest problem I have with this place is deciding what to get. Luckily they are understanding and get they have to give me a while to decide. I pick 5 possible options and slim to one or two from there. Everything I have had tastes awesome. It is a party in my mouth and my taste buds love it. Should I mention the prices are also great? I am telling you, if you like dessert go here. 

PS: try their cannolis"}
{"text":"I have to say first that I am giving this review because of the terrible managerial experience that we had when we visited Romeo's in May. I have eaten here many times and we have brought several friends to this restaurant for their first time, so you would think that we would've been treated better. 
Our problem was not with the food, the food here is AMAZING. My problem was that when we first sat down there were a couple ants crawling on our table. No one in our party is what you'd consider a \"high maintenance\" diner, so we killed them and placed our order without even commenting to our server. However, after our food came, my husband happened to glance to the side of his plate where a crumb had fallen and there were ANTS SWARMING the food. Seriously, about 50-60 ants. We immediately and discretely got the attention of our server, whose only comment was, \"I guess I'll have something to do after we close.\" No comment about offering to move us or comping our meal or anything like it. In fact, we wanted to have dessert, so we asked if we could move and he did accommodate us. After we had been moved, the manager came out and looked at our table and said not a single word to us. We then had our dessert, our server brought out our checks and, surprise, not a single thing comped. We paid and left all feeling really put out by the situation. We immediately tried to phone and talk to the manager, but we were told there was no manager there?!?!? Really??? No manager to talk to on a Saturday night?
To be completely fair to this restaurant, I sent them a letter detailing our experience and I received absolutely no response. This is why I'm posting this information. While the food there is good, it seems like it might be time for them to receive a visit from the health department. If they want to keep their customer base, they need to work on the customer service."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today, had my mother and four year old son with me to enjoy a nice lunch.  However, we were in welcomed and told we would have to sit outside.  At first they said it was because there was a private meeting inside but there were plenty of tables.  We said ok to sitting outside just because we wanted to try the place.  We literally were sat next to an elevator.  The wait mor came over, had no personality and just said, \"here are the menus, let me know when you want to order.\"  We ordered a Greek salad which came out with no lettuce, and we were told they didn't offer kid menus.  Then it became very clear that it was not a \"kid friendly\" place.  I asked if he had anything he could make that would be for kids.  He brought my son a piece of pita with cheese on it and told me he couldn't do a small plate of French fries.  My mother and I also each had a Greek gyro.  This was not a true Greek gyro.  The sauce was bland and it had crumbled meat inside of it.  We waited over 20 minutes for the bill and were charged $40!  Very disappointed with not only the service but also the lack of friendliness."}
{"text":"Don't expect fast or super professional service. Saying that, each dish is made by hand so it takes a little while. But the results are delicious. The menu is very extensive, but my favorite is the lamp gyro with thick cut home made French fries with extra tahini sauce for dipping. Delicious! This place has great food and is inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place to eat in Gilbert.  If you have never been here you don't know what your missing.  The desserts are amazing!"}
{"text":"Romeo's has good food, but be prepared to wait for it.  I took my friend here for her bday dinner and was disappointed that they could only \"provide a candle if you order dessert\".  I mean does it really hurt them that much to do a small brownie or piece of cake when my bill was over 100?  I think I could have provided the candle...but thanks.

There wasn't anything special about this place that made me feel like I would want to return."}
{"text":"What happened to this place? Used to be a nice secret tucked away in gilbert. Now its just blah. So sad"}
{"text":"I often use extremes in my reviews....\"best service\" or \"worst logo\"...you get the idea. Unfortunately, I'm not concerned about overusing superlatives in this review. Instead, eating at Euro Cafe turned out to just be weird. Like seriously weird.

We walked into the cutesy gift shop/waiting area (think LGO for old ladies) and we were greeted by a very chipper young teenage hostess with whom we had some fun, pleasant banter. I was thinking....hmm, this place should be cool. Before we sat down, I glanced over to the large dessert case, which--from my friend's recommendations--was likely to be the highlight of the visit, and I was a bit surprised to see that it was half-empty. And this was at 7pm on a Saturday night.

I wasn't too worried, though. Our server seemed great at first. She actually just sat down at our table and talked all about the menu with us....she was very helpful and made a couple of recommendations. She proceeded to take our drink orders, for me a glass of the Malbec and, for my dining companion, a vanilla latte. We had to re-try on the wine because they were out of the Malbec, but no big deal, right? Our drinks arrived, and she asked us if we had decided on our entrees.This was when her attitude got a bit weird and pushy. We told her what entrees we wanted, but before we could even tell her that we also wanted to try an appetizer, she jetted away from the table. If I may add, she left the table grabbing my companion's latte without asking if she was finished (she still had about 10% of the drink she wanted to enjoy).

The server then brought our salads. Their salad is a nice, standard mixed greens and I ordered the yogurt dressing which was quite nice. We finished our salads, and being the good former server I am, I placed our plates--along with my fork--in a small pre-bussed stack on the side of our table. My friend asked me if I thought they would want me to re-use my fork, and I replied \"I'm not planning on eating a $20 entree with a re-used fork\". Note: I'm aware that $20 isn't like haute cuisine pricing, but I mean I just don't think you should have to lick the dressing off of  a salad fork to eat your entree at that price point. What happened next was very weird. The waitress stopped by, saw my dirty fork on top of my pre-bussing pile, then proceeded to--while I sat there perfectly still and silent--take my dirty fork off of my salad plate and move it over to my place setting next to my clean knife. Weird.

Then our entrees came. Well, they were really tossed at us more than anything. She dropped the pork tenderloin in front of me and the almond tortellini in front of my friend, which is especially odd since the server had made such a big deal about me being a vegetarian. I'm not surprised, though. I had--just five minutes earlier--seen a full-on food auction at the table next to us because the server had no idea who ordered what. Anyway, back to our food. Our server just dropped the food and walked away before we could say anything....not asking \"does everything look ok\" or \"is there anything else I can get for you\". Of course, it wasn't the end of the world for us to have to switch our plates, it was just really weird.

The good news is that my Almond Tortellini was amazing. It was full of fun surprises like sunflower seeds and pine nuts, and the sauce was heavenly. The tortellini were the perfect texture and consistency. My dining companion ordered the tenderloin, and although I couldn't try any of it, I couldn't help but notice that the amount of sawing it required to cut off a bite was more reminiscent of a pork chop than a tenderloin. In spite of the dryness of the meat,  it looked to be a nice balance of flavors, with a cherry sauce, grilled onions, and horseradishy mashed potatoes. The odd service continued, though. No one ever checked back to ask about the food, and when my friend's water went empty it was a full 8 1/2 minutes for the hostess to finally come by and refill it. Even more odd was that once we had clearly finished our entrees, it was a long time before anyone came by to take away our plates. It was 18 minutes between our last bite and when our server came back (yes, I was keeping track by now, because the whole thing was just so odd). She offered dessert, but by this time, we both just wanted to leave, so we asked for the check.

When she brought back the check and my card, she suddenly was miss personality, telling us how glad she was that we came and how much she looks forward to seeing us again. Honestly, I wish she had been so helpful when we were actually still having our meal.

Overall, the environment at this restaurant is just plain weird and uncomfortable. I would love to eat the Tortellini again, but if the price for enjoying that great dish is sitting through another hour of awkwardness in this restaurant, I'll just have to go without"}
{"text":"A friend of mine suggested we go here and we were not disappointed. Considering the small size of the cafe and the kitchen, the choice and variety that the menu offers will surprise you with delight.

Service was very warm, welcoming and friendly. We could not have asked for a kinder, more professional and courteous server than Mike.

We started with the fried artichokes with ranch dressing and they were delightful...For the entree, I had the Greco-Roman chicken which essentially consists of grilled chicken breasts topped with fresh roasted vegetables (artichokes, zucchini, onions, mushrooms and bell peppers. The entrees also came with a nice salad served with a creamy feta cheese dressing. My friend enjoyed the chicken plaka which consisted of breaded chicken breasts in a creamy sauce with artichoke hearts and pasta.

The entrees we had  were moderately priced at $ 18.00 each with the portions being very generous.

Do not be fooled by the entryway pastry case which displays an array of wonderful cakes and pastries of all sizes.

Romeo's Euro Cafe has previously been featured on Chef Robert McGrath's \"Check Please\""}
{"text":"Euro cafe was pricey and the food was fair. I had the lamb gyro. It was just ok. The cucumber sauce was fair. My wife had the ravioli witch had more cheese then ravioli. Fries were over cooked. Won't eat it again. So far it's the only restaurant I won't return to in downtown Gilbert.  Thumbs down."}
{"text":"Excellent dessert, wine selection and sandwiches. For a heavier entree, try the Pork Molise. A little pricey for Gilbert, but otherwise a solid choice."}
{"text":"Very cute ambiance.  House made pastries/desserts which are very rare because Desserts are an after thought usually.  Traditional/classic French pastry style desserts.

Food was fantastic,  maybe a little over use of feta cheese.  The ingredients in all dishes are well thought out and bursting with flavor.  Fresh/hot.

The only thing that was dissapointing was slow service.  The seating is limited so I suggest coming for lunch or weekday dinner.  On a busy night a server \"should NEVER\" be sitting down and just chatting it up while customers are pilled in the door waiting.  Hostess had no system and seemed a bit clueless to operate logically.  I did see the owner running around but I think she was busy flirting with the bus boy."}
{"text":"There are a lot of great options to dine when visiting Downtown Gilbert, but don't forget the cute and comfortable Romeo's Euro Cafe. This cafe is located inside Heritage Court, close to the tattoo parlor and right before all the business of Gilbert Road. 

Although my husband and I visited on a busy Friday, we were surprised to be seated right away! The cafe is very inviting, intimate, comfortable and perfect for a date-night. I felt like I was living \"Lady in the Tramp\" spaghetti scene in the small town of Gilbert Arizona. There are plenty of options for different wines, appetizers, entrees and baked goods. 

For a small cafe it was very busy but our waitress was hustling! I was worried from previous reviews about the service and it was absolutely fine. She was very attentive, checked on us frequently and almost seemed to be flying between different tables. My husband and I appreciated her help and service. 

My husband and I have never seemed to have so much trouble ordering food but this cafe has such an incredible menu and variety of options! Exactly as the location indicates, it focuses on Italian, Mediterranean and overall \"European\" cuisine. We ended up deciding to go more Greek and ordered: the Greka, Gyro Skins and the Seafood Santorini. The Greka was a baked dish made up of different olives, peppers and feta. It was good but not the most memorable. They Gyro Skins were baked potatoes with gyro meat and tzatziki sauce. My husband enjoyed this the most; however I thought the tzatziki sauce had too much garlic. The Seafood Santorini was similar to the Greka, good but not something I would order again. 

Overall, my husband and I loved the location, the venue and atmosphere. Although we weren't blown away by our dishes, it was probably just our selection. We still can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"Mehhh this place was just meh !! I was recommended to this place so I brought me and my 2 friends to try it out. 
Atmosphere; it has a cafe type vibe not fancy dining or anything, the servers and staff were nice but she had a bigger table so she seemed more concerned with that. We got an appetizer which was the feta fritta something and that was awesome . We all ordered main dishes and didn't like any of them. The taste was so bland and flavorless it didn't taste homemade literally tasted like something I would throw together at my house with random food items I had left over . I ended up returning mine because it tasted like noodles with lemon squeezed over it doused with white wine and then microwaved . The chicken was so dry I couldn't guzzle my water fast enough. Overall disappointed at all the food we got and I tried everyone's dish.  The server was super duper nice tho about me sending it back and there desert was so so so so good ! I just hope they work on there menu items and add some more flavor to make this the place it can be !"}
{"text":"\"WORST RESTAURANT EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE\"

I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS on places but this one had to be done. My wife and I have travelled many places and eaten at many restaurants. We go out to eat every weekend and when we like a place we tell everyone about it and go back many times. 

My experience with Romeo's was so shocking, rude and offensive I could not not post my review.

This was our 4th time going to Romeos in the last 3 months since reading about them in the paper of how great their desserts were. My wife and I love desert cafe's and Romeo's had a large selection. The first time we went we each got dessert and liked what we got. The 2nd time we went with freinds for dinner and thought it was pretty good. The menu is so huge it took us 20 minutes to order as we couldn't decide on what to eat. The 3rd time we went for desert with 10 people from my office. 

The final and 4th time we went which was on Friday was litteraly the worst experince of my life. 3 out of 4 times we went we alaways had the same waitress who I am assuming now is the owner. (I did not get her name).

We came once again for dessert and my wife and her sister spent about 20 minutes trying to decide on what to order. They went to the restroom for a bit and then came back. They had ordered a piece of white cake, baklava cheesecake and some fudgy pie cake thing. The cheesecake was pretty good, the fudgy thing was decent although at 5.50 was extremely small and the white cake thing was terriable. It was dry and basically no flavor. We all tried it and left basically 3/4 of the cake.

When the bill came it was 3 pieces of cake and tax. I told our waitress that I did not wish to pay for the piece of white cake as we did not think it was good and dry. She just looked at us and walked into the back of the restaurant and told the lady that had helped us the 3 times in the past.

THIS IS WHERE IT GETS SHOCKING:

The waitress (owner) came over to our table and said I was told you didnt like something you ordered. I proceeded to tell her that we would pay for the other items but didnt think the white cake was good as it was to dry. She then proceeded to pick up the plate with my fork on it. I knew what she was going to do and sat there in shock. She litteraly cut a piece off the cake and ate it and said \"there is nothing wrong with this cake, it is not dry\". I told her I cannot believe you just did that. She said I am not going to take this off of the bill just because you didnt like it. She then asked me and my brother in law if we owned our own businesses which we do both happen to do. She then walked away from our table.

As we all sat there in SHOCK I said I am not paying for that cake. I left $11 in cash which was 2 cakes and tax and walked out. My wife, sister in law and her husband stayed in the restaurant. The waitress then came back to the table and said so you just are not going to pay for the food. They again told her they would pay for it all but that piece of cake. She then proceeded to say to my sister in law out loud to the whole restaurant. \"Are you not the one who was just in the bathroom throwing up\" trying to make her look stupid in front of the other patrons. At this they left the money on the table - minus the cake money and walked out.

What was this person thinking? We estimated that this piece of cake cost them .80 to make. Was it really worth the amount of lost business they will be recieving? The least she should have done was to offer us something to replace this piece of cake with or just offered to remove the charge from the bill. Besides the 12 other people we told to come to this restaurant who will never go again. How many people will they tell.

Like I said I never post reviews but this experience to me was so shocking I couldnt not leave a review."}
{"text":"Don't bother going to the Euro Cafe on Thursday night if they are hosting their own dinners down the hall.  We had a party of 4 and 2 of us had to send back a crusted ravioli salad and pita bread.  The bread was stale and the ravioli was not cooked.  Very disappointed.  My prior visit was pleasant, but this one we waiting for service for 4 salads over 30 minutes due to staff concentrating on the \"dinner\" down the hall."}
{"text":"There's something for everyone on the menu, and they have an extensive wine list.  Been there twice and have enjoyed my meal and dining experience both times.  I could stare at the dessert counter for hours!"}
{"text":"Being a Gilbert resident and foodie I can say that I really appreciate having a place like this with great quality food and service.  Gilbert has only a handful of  non- chain quality restaurants and this is a must go. I did not try any entree item but the lunch and appetizer I had were delicious!.  If you are into wine they have a large selection and desserts are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G !  my husband had tiramisu and it was delicious (not to brag but we've been to Italy so we know what a GOOD tiramisu should taste like...) They make a feta dressing in- house and I was hooked immediately. So, if you like mediterranean flavors and european style desserts/coffee, give this place a try."}
{"text":"I hate to have to do this sort of follow-up, but I really need to.

Went on Saturday (again before a Hale Theater play). We were a party of six (with reservation), which they seemed to only be able to seat us across two small round tables. But OK, they were busy...

Realized that it was quite warm inside, and no ceiling fan anywhere near us. Again, OK, it is Arizona,

We were going to share a bottle of wine among us, as no one wanted to drink too much. Asked for a taste of one of the Pinots that was available by the glass as well as bottle. The waitress brought a glass that was not only way too warm, but had obviously already turned. So we chose the Castle Rock. No good - were out of it. So then it became the next higher priced Pinot, which was fine. But no offer of holding the price, no apology for the spoiled wine. Looking around, the walls are lined with their stored wine bottles. But given the warm environment I would suggest beer instead.

On to the food. Still large portions. We shared two appetizers, Eggplant Capri and Portobellini, portobello mushrooms and veggie mix. Both were good and large for appetizers.

Our server had warned us that everything was cooked to order and if we had a time issue, to be aware. She should have warned us more strongly, as after a long wait our food came barely 15 minutes before we had to leave. It was only four pita sandwiches (one of which got mixed up), one salad, and my Asparagus Eggplant, which was dry and overcooked.

No chance to stay for their delicious-looking desserts as we had to leave.

Too bad. This was my go-to place for near the Hale. Good thing there are more choices there now, such as Postino's, Joy Ride and Barrio Queen.

Oh well..."}
{"text":"Nothing else like it in Gilbert.  Great alternative to the normal dining experience.  Taste of Euro Cafe on Thursday nights is a \"must try\" for those looking for amazing food, good conversation and an event as opposed to just a meal.
Can't recommend Euro Cafe enough!"}
{"text":"Yummy food. TERRIBLE time/order management. Came to dinner on a Tuesday night with my boyfriend, and it took longer than usual to get our order. Not a big deal since we were enjoying a night out together. But today, I called in an order at 6:50, was told 25-30 min to pick up, so when I arrived at 7:15, I was told it would be another 20 minutes! Unacceptable!"}
{"text":"Gonna go out on a limb here and recommend that you steer clear of this place. This is the 1st 1 star review I have ever given anyone. Located in downtown Gilbert, there are just entirely to many good places within walking distance to waste your time or hard earned $ in this pretentious little curio shop/bistro. The service is bad and rather cold, their knowledge of fine wine even worse. Whats with the trinket shop in the waiting area? Lets buy trinkets/junk while we are given attitude about where to wait for our table. Really? Our food arrived cold, our server rarely arrived at all & I got up to get my own water after giving up on ordering another glass of vino. SOMEONE CALL GORDON RAMSAY! This truly is hell's kitchen."}
{"text":"Fantastic favors from a wide selection of  Mediterranean recipes you will not find anywhere else. I highly recommend Romeo's whenever you are in the mood for a Mediterranean type of meal from a menu unlike any other you have ever seen, in a good way!"}
{"text":"I keep forgetting to Yelp about this place! Maybe that's a sign, though it wasn't awful. Another book club stop. It's pretty small, hence the \"cafe\". Very loud too, not the best place to hold a book club meeting. The food was very good, I had a veggie bleu cheese pita sandwich, which was very tasty, once they remembered that I ordered it. I would love to do one of their tasting nights, looks like a good deal and you can try several things on the menu at once. Also want to try their desserts- looked very yummy!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and setting..so unique and different to every other resturant. True mediterranean..good wine list..interesting service..must go!"}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that you will probably never go to...unless someone tells you to go there. So I am telling you. Go. It's so different and unique. You have to go with an appetite because the menu is large and inviting. I mean, the appetizers section alone could satisfy me for dinner. We tried the Focaccia and Peasant Platter. But the rest of the menu, especially their chicken plates, is amazing. I had to debate between pasta, which I really wanted to try and the caper chicken. It was fresh and flavorful and the portions were huge. Next I want to try the pitas. The menu is so authentic and the environment is casual yet special. You feel like you will never go to a place like this again, and that's because you probably won't! I went on a date and it was so surprising and not what I was expecting. It's a little pricey, but I feel, well worth it. This is no chain restaurant! You could go for lunch with friends or a nice dinner and that's what I love about this place. I will keep going back."}
{"text":"Christina gave our group great service on a Saturday around lunch time. She was awesome. I believe everyone else loved the food as well. Generous portion sizes!"}
{"text":"I paid $4.25 for an iced vanilla latte and was expecting something of high quality, however, the drink was so sweet that I couldn't even taste the espresso. The excessive amount of syrup left a strange feeling on my tongue for 45 minutes. Then when I went to pay I realized they charged me for baklava that I didn't order? When I told them they straightened it out but didn't really provide much of an apology."}
{"text":"After spending most of Saturday grazing at various East Valley locations, who would have thought any of us could find more room to eat any more? Well, we did. And Romeo's was the perfect fit for topping us off. Instead of going with entrees, we opted for a few appetizers. Good, filling and flavorful.

Afterwards, the desserts seemed to be a hit since their plates were nearly licked clean. (Since I'm not one to eat sweets, the cleanliness of a plate afterwards is the only gauge I have for such things.)

Our server was the sweetest thing ever! I wanted to wrap her up and bring her home. But, that's frowned upon in certain societies."}
