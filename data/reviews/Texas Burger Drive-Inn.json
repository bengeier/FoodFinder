{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!  No frills, friendly service, and delicious homemade food.  The owner takes great pride in serving large quantities of freshly prepared food.  Not as fast or cheap as McD's but way better quality food and bigger quantity; made with care by adults who have been working there for years.  Texas Burger makes delicious souvlaki, burgers, and fries, and there are several other menu items I have yet to try. A lot of regulars go here for a reason, and I think they deserve more recognition and visits by first timers."}
{"text":"Have driven by this spot a few times. My wife always had said no to going in, let's be honest the place needs to be renovated. 

Online reviews looked great but now I'm sceptical about the authenticity of the reviews.

What I tried 10oz Texas burger with a pouting and a small drink - $26 after taxes. Not worth the price.

The burger is dry and lacks flavour. Needs some herbs and spices to make it better.

The fries taste like McCain fries that aren't crispy. The poutine gravy was the saving grace but as a whole was lack luster.

My search for the best burger in Durham continues. Retro Burger still holds top spot for taste and value for burgers and poutine."}
{"text":"This is a hole in the wall burger joint. They also have Greek food. Their burgers are okay - definitely not my favourite and their prices are outrageously expensive. We had a buy one , get one free burger when you purchase a fry and a pop and the total came to 16$ with a gravy? No thanks. I would rather go to Harvey's. Staff is also indifferent to their customers and or on the rude side. This place also only takes cash so if you have a card you have to use the ATM inside which charges."}
{"text":"Husband got the burger said was great and I got the grilled chicken sandwich .they don't have whole wheat buns so they used whole wheat bread . The chicken in have to say was rubbery and made me a bit ill. I was a bit upset because I am thinking that was not what I expected. I will try a burger when we do take out next but I am a bit wary now :-("}
{"text":"Burgers are juicey - however the price is a little on the higher side. Monday's they have a 2 for one burger (does not include side or drink though)...however even with that deal it was $17.  Extra toppings are more $$'s cheese, bacon - and even tzatziki sauce is extra (come on already with the extra's a bit much).

Not really a busy place - but steady.

Pricepoint is a bit high - the burger is juice but a bit bland for my liking - so toppings are a must.  Pretty good burger though - homemade and not a cookie cut burger.  Bun is a white boy boring bun though and toppings are run of the mill and tzatsiki cost you if you want anything extra on the bun that is outside of the usual lettuce, tomato and uncooked raw onions etc.

Fries are quite good  - drinks are your boring sugar filled pop from a fountain.  Other people's pictures are a good reflection of the burger - the bun is bland - burger is juicey - good quality meat but a bit on the bland side tastewise."}
{"text":"I have to say, I'm basing this rating on my last visit. Typically I go to Texas Burger for their Gyros dinner which is great but this time, I had a two-for-one coupon for an actual Texas Burger (with the purchase of fries and a drink) so I figured I'd give it a shot. The meal still came to $14.00. Turns out, a Texas Burger is over $7.00!!... are you kidding me?  For what? As you can see from the picture attached, it's nothing special. Boring in fact. I don't get it... and I certainly will never order one again. And where's my huge helping of fries that the previous reviewer seems to get?  :(

I will say though, the service is always friendly at this place (although the lady behind the cash wasn't being all that friendly to the young lad she was training) and the other food I've had here has always been good... I just don't recommend coming here for their burgers.

If I was rating them on their Gyros, it would probably be a 3 star but everything during this last experience was just... meh."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  Peoples who gives high scores, are you ever tried anything better then carrot? This place is terrible. Just look around, tables and chairs legs rusty, walls dirty need big cleaning. Their \"Famous\"  burgers garbage! Meat 100% mixed with  soybean or just plain flour, very bad taste! French fries just bad, fish and chips.. no words. Sorry! Never ever tried  food same as in this place."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Texas Burger since I was a kid. I LOVE their tasty burgers and fries. Always a huge helping of fried. I have recently developed a food allergy, and the owner has personally taken care of my needs. Amazing family owned place."}
