{"text":"Good food, just a little over priced considering it's proximity to CMU. It will scratch that itch for Chinese food if you have it, but the food isn't anything special. Their Crispy Orange Chicken and Broccoli Beef are my go-to entrees."}
{"text":"This place deserves 5 stars because it is some of the best food you can get for your money, and because they mean it when they say express!

I have tried many things from this restaurant and my top favorites are the Singapore Rice Noodles, Hunan Chicken and ANYTHING tofu.  I'm a really big fan of their fried tofu in general but when served in the orange or the spicy General Tsos variety I am the happiest of girls.

Though a friend from work avoids the lunch specials because she doesn't like the egg rolls it is a staple in my order always.

I recommend this venue if you are looking for good food and value over a lunch break."}
{"text":"BBQ pork over rice is good. 
Based on the large portion, the price is quite reasonable.
I will certainly go back to this place.

12/15/2015 I went back there again. The young lady at the counter was very helpful."}
{"text":"The new location on Elmwood Ave is neat and clean. Our order was ready super fast and the Orange Chicken was DELICIOUS. A little crispy with a thick sauce. Also, the vegetable fried rice has nice big piece of veggies in it.

Awesome place for the cost. Lunch special was $5 and comes with 2 rangoon."}
{"text":"OK food - served really FAST 

consistently nasty waitress (owner?)"}
{"text":"It's ok, though a bit greasier than I'd prefer.  I usually order take-out Beef Chow Fun which comes in an aluminum tray, and I swear the grease  seems to leak through the aluminum to the outside of the tray too, which isn't even possible.  It's not any cheaper than LuLu's, but they do seem a lot faster.

As for the bubble tea.... I tried one of the less popular flavors my first time there (either red bean or taro), and it tasted exactly like that dental office latex glove smell.  Definitely stick with the normal flavors, or get your bubble tea from LuLu's."}
{"text":"Great chinese food at reasonable prices. Much better choice than the more popular Lulu's. Small location has nice ambiance and service here is pretty quick."}
{"text":"Sorry, but they committed a pretty big sin.

Called in an order of I think eggplant tofu with brown rice. \"We don't have brown rice,\" the friendly person taking my order says, and so I get steamed rice. No problem.

Picked it up, it was ready quickly, friendly service in the restaurant, paid and left. Sat down to eat it a few minutes later. Healthy portions and quite delicious until...there was some meat in the entree. I found a small piece, I picked it out, life goes on. It's ok.

I was enjoying the rice, which came with some cooked vegetables mixed in (a nice innovation, I thought) but unfortunately in there were a whole lot more pieces of meat swimming around with the vegetables. Not being a carnivore, what started as a really good meal became pretty gross to me.

I was sad because I'd thought I'd found a new place to get lots of takeout."}
{"text":"I ordered eggplant tofu fish hot pot pickup today. After I arrived home I found out that there's no fish nor tofu in my food. This is not the first time. When you order pickup, they sometimes \"accidentally\" forget to put meat into your dish."}
{"text":"I enjoy Orient Express primarily for its large portions, cheap prices, and wide array of vegetarian options.  Other Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh (and elsewhere) have a much more limited selection of vegetarian in my experience.  

Their service might be brusque, but it's incredibly fast, and when I go there, I'm not looking for a fine-dining experience.  I usually get take-out, and it takes 10 minutes or less (I often wonder how they make my food so quickly)."}
{"text":"I will never again go here.

I'm tired of the lady that always seem pissed-off taking my order or making me boba. 

Last time my husband and I went, we checked their hours on the door and walked in (the door was unlocked). The lady yells at us, rather rudely, \"DON'T YOU SEE LIGHTS OFF!\" 

First of all... the lights were not off. It was dim. It was our first time going after sunset. We thought it was mood lighting. 

Second of all... as if the pissed-offed service wasn't bad enough, we had to be yelled at?!

I never thought their food was that great anyway. I've heard my Chinese friends say that she's nice. Well as a non-Chinese speaking person, I've only been rudely serviced over and over again. 

Go to Little Asia for Chinese food and LuLu's for boba... or walk in if you don't see the old lady working there."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  Tons of reasonably decent-quality food served lightning-fast for cheap.  It's basically the Chinese-food equivalent of a diner (only cleaner than your average dive, with Enya or some other Celtic-lite music in the background).

The waiters are not particularly friendly--though having observed them chatting with Chinese patrons, I suspect they mostly don't speak much English.  But that's ok--decide what you want and tell them, and they'll go away; take a friend or a book and you won't even notice.  (Why is gruffness a good thing in waitresses at dive diners but bad in staff at a dive Chinese place?)

This place is *fast*.  Whether I've come at 5pm on a Saturday or 1230 on a weekday, the food is on the table within 15 minutes, sometimes half that.  (They won't hold your dish while they finish your tablemates', though; if something takes a while, you could almost finish before your friend gets to eat.  Be a good friend and share.)

This place is reasonably tasty--it's not the best Chinese in town, and it's definitely not going to win any awards, except perhaps from the student papers at the universities it's in between.  But it's decent, with good balance between meat and vegetables, and there's a lot of it.  I usually go early afternoon and order off the $6 lunch-special menu:  Skip breakfast, and you'll be set for the day, or eat breakfast and go for lunch, and you'll have lunch for the next day, too."}
{"text":"Would have given 5 if not for the subjective service standards sometimes, and the takeaway is not as nice. But the General tso chicken is a must try, and it's so close CMU!"}
{"text":"I go here very often.  The quality of the food isnt the greatest, the meat can sometimes be dry/hard to chew depending on the time of the day.  Service isn't the greatest either.

The food DOES come very fast however and is relatively cheap.  It's good to go when you're craving Asian food and the lunch special is amazing.

Come with the expectation of a quick chinese take out or sit in.  If you're a food fanatic that is really up tight and picky about your food you probably don't want to come here.  The food isn't bad, and when you're really craving asian food its amazing."}
{"text":"We've waited for more than an hour before the first dish. what's worse, people who came later than us were served earlier. And they didn't tell us they were running out of dumplings until we waited for more than an hour."}
{"text":"I want to write a good, reasonble review for OE, but I don't have the care to do so...come to this place if you're lacking taste buds. If you want real authentic Chinese food, then try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Orient Express serves no nonsense affordable American Chinese food. The decor is pleasant and clean, and the prices are reasonable. The food is also quick and pretty good. Oh and they have really nice plastic takeout containers.

I really like the dumplings and the string beans with beef, and the hot pots are always pleasant surprises. A particularly standout attribute of Orient Express is that all the dishes seem to come with a lot of vegetables, which is uncommon amongst American Chinese restaurants and I think separates good from bad Chinese food. 

While you're not going to find the most \"authentic\" Chinese food at the Orient Express, the Americanized Chinese food they serve is pretty darn good. And if you can't enjoy a good General Tso's Chicken because it isn't \"authentic\" - something is wrong with you (and maybe you can have an aneurism at the thought that General Tso's has been exported back to the old country and is being served in Taiwan). 

The owner, Peter, is a really good guy and isn't above taking orders, cleaning tables, and is almost always at the restaurant. During my student days, sometimes we needed catering for student events, and Peter was always reasonable and willing to work within your budget."}
{"text":"I ate here for lunch with a group of friends and was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. The service was very fast and friendly and the prices were reasonable. It will now be my \"go to\" Chinese place for lunch."}
{"text":"First tried the place around 3:00 on a Sunday afternoon. As we walked in, a middle-aged woman sat at a table next to the cash register. She asked us \"Here or to go?\" We said here. She jerked her head to the left, vaguely indicating the entire restaurant, and said \"Sit down.\" We wondered why she was so mad at us for coming into her restaurant. We sat, ordered and like we do at LuLu's, got out or phones and magazines prepared to wait for a while. The food came out almost immediately. It was hot, fast, and absolutely delicious. Steamed veggie dumplings were a bit bland but the dipping sauce was superb. Mayalysian Satay Chicken was not a peanut sauce but a spicy red sauce. Really good. My Tofu Eggplant Fish Hot Pot (a piping hot clay bowl filled with all of those things plus veggies) was so good I didn't want it to end. Luckily the portion was so huge I had enough for lunch the next day. The Ginger Smoothie was made with real ginger so it had that fabulous bite. Seriously good. 
The next time we try this place we'll likely get take-out since the service was so ... weird. I won't go into boring details - you'll see for yourself when you go there - I'm just saying the service is bad enough to make us not want to suffer through it again, but not bad enough to cancel out the deliciousness of the food we definitely want to have again. If the service had been friendly, we'd definitely have given this place 4 or 5 stars."}
{"text":"I ordered online and specifically made a note to them that I had a severe peanut allergy and to please not poison me. My dish was fine but they did not realize that the egg rolls are fried in peanut oil and were part of my order. Allergies are not something to mess around with and it ruined my night, being that I was knocked out on Benedryl after my lips and cheeks started to swell. I will not order here again, which is a shame because the food was alright until I started getting sick."}
{"text":"I am very disappointed with the dishonesty of the restaurant. My friends and I went to the place the other day. The total price for each person is 7.3 ~ish. We give ~15% tip and authorized the payment of ~$9 from my card. However, my friend told me yesterday that his credit card was charged 11.34 instead of 9. I checked my credit card statement and found the same thing. I thought it was fraud but since it is only $2, I don't want to waste much time on this. But I want everyone been to this place to be aware and I will never go to this place again."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a large portioned, delicious Chinese dish for a decent price then you've found the right place! Huge portions, and great specials on chicken wings and pork fried rice or teriyaki skewers. 

The price is about $5.00 - $7.00 for a dish and the service is top notch!

Quick drink refills and orders take minutes to complete. They were also voted among the top 100 chinese take-out restaurants in the country!"}
{"text":"Decent, cheap, and quick pretty much describe O-E. I generally get take-out coming back from a long day of lab work at CMU, and it always hits the spot. It's normally only a 5 minute wait to grab food and go. Outside of a few staples (sesame crispy beef/chicken), I've been disappointed by trying a whole bunch of different options on the menu.

This place is better than some other items along Craig Street, but it's certainly not the best. As long as you don't go in expecting anything other than fast Chinese cuisine, you'll probably be disappointed."}
{"text":"The service is really good. I got at least once a week and they never disappoint me. My favorite is the special house rice, it is massive so you can share it with two or three people."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you want quick service, an attentive waitstaff, a \"special\" request like rice noodles instead of rice, or good food. Perfect for college kids."}
{"text":"During the 8 day trip in Pittsburgh, this restaurant is my favorite. Authentic Chinese food and the people are nice. Price is really good. I really wish there is a similar restaurant near where I live."}
{"text":"This review may not be really fair since all I have ever ordered here has been bubble tea (I do not like Chinese food in general). I always get the mocha bubble tea, and it is always consisten and pretty good. After moving from California to Pittsburgh, it was hard to find a good bubble tea. But I finally achieved my mission!"}
{"text":"I've searched high and low for Chinese food in Madison, and this one comes the closest for me.  This is one of two places in the Madison/Middleton area where I would go for Chinese (the other is Ichiban on Park Street).  The food is delicious, service is friendly, and it's located conveniently by my home.  I usually get take-out, but the restaurant also has a dining area.  Whenever I get food here, pick-up is quick (never more than 15 minutes ready from the time I call) and the food is always piping hot.  The menu contains both a regular Chinese menu (for American palates), and a vegetarian-only menu.  Both are extensive.  I've also heard a rumor that there is a Chinese-only menu that is available.  I haven't ordered anything here that I haven't liked.  Try the pork-fried rice, beef with mixed veggies, and lo mein (any of the varieties are good).  If you like General Tso's Chicken, try it here.  Most places make General Tso's with tiny bits of chicken, and have a dry texture because it's over-cooked--then covered with a bland, un-spicy sauce.  Orient Express makes a really good one--lots of good pieces of chicken and a great spicy sauce.  If you make it for lunch, they also have great lunch combination platters.  I go here a lot, and haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"The quality of the food here is declining rapidly. I used to order from here all the time, at least twice a week at one point. Now I barely go there and the food disappoints me 90% of the time. The fried rice I usually order is way too salty now and the General Tso's Chicken is topped with watered down sauce and gray on the inside. Budget cuts maybe?"}
{"text":"Though I wouldn't normally give this place 4 stars, I give it for 4 stars in relation to the other eateries right next to CMU(Craig St. Area). 

The prices are good and they have a decent lunch special. Their noodle dishes are all good like their loi mein(Shanghai style if you prefer the thicker noodles) and chow fan. 

I think this place is by far better than Lulu's. 

The service isn't \"friendly\", but it is competent and quick, unlike Lulu's service which is neither friendly, competent nor quick."}
{"text":"Pretty much what you could expect from an American Chinese takeout place that is located within a strip mall. Food is nothing exceptional but I must commend the cleanliness of the restaurant, including the restrooms. The dinning area is spacious, well-ordered and comfortable. Although, the space seemed a little bit depressed late a night with the florescent lighting."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here often enough that the manager knows our order.  It's great for what it is, which is which is somewhat greasy Chinese non-cuisine - \"stuff plus sauce, over rice\".  I like the food (particularly the tofu) much better than Lu Lu's, but the bubble tea is definitely inferior, made from powders with undercooked (and not in a good, Q kind of way) pearls.

Once you get past the \"stuff plus sauce\" menu, there are a few dishes that are actually pretty good - the salt-baked tofu is really good, as are the sauteed greens with garlic.  The green bean dishes are a massive pile of green beans which could probably feed you for a week."}
{"text":"I love the shrimp in lobster sauce here. The flavor is just right. I love the salty, eggy white sauce that smothers the shrimp, mushrooms, snow peas and crunchy water chestnuts. There were at least a dozen medium-sized, succulent shrimp in an order, so it is a good value too. 

My dinner companion enjoyed the shrimp in egg. It is a little greasy to have as a meal, but it is nice to share.

It's hard to rate this place because I really enjoy what I get there but think other dishes are just average. The four stars are for the shrimp in lobster sauce, not exactly the restaurant overall. My expectations for service and ambiance aren't high for a restaurant in Oakland. It's a solid, quick lunch and dinner spot."}
{"text":"what a hidden gem ! their braised beef noodle is filled with flavour and probably one of the best I had. A little on the high end but portions they gave was worth it. look forward to returning !"}
{"text":"Their dumplings are great. But everything else tastes like something you could find in the freezer section at the grocery store. Not to mention we waited over 30 minutes for our to-go order. I would understand if it was really busy or something but we were the only ones there."}
{"text":"Orient Express has improved in my two years here. If you know what to get, the food can be pretty good. It's not as authentic as Ka Mei (in Squirrel Hill), and the dishes are probably geared more towards CMU and Pitt students -- so expect heavy sauces and lots of vegetables padding each dish. Here are a few dishes I think have a fairy authentic flavor -- (xian yu ji li/xia ren cao fan) Salt Fish and Chicken/Shrimp Fried Rice, (kong xin cai, or ying cai) Not sure how to say it in English, but its the hollow vegetable...I think its called sauteed chinese greens or something on the menu, Baby Bok Choi (always a fav), and the (zha jiang mian) or Pork Noodles. Lunch specials are a good deal. I usually get the green beans (gan cao si ji dou) with steamed rice and the chicken. Dishes I don't like include: vegetable spring roll, mapo tofu -- I have yet to find a good mapo tofu in Pittsburgh. The service (with the exception of the male waiter) is kind of mean, which I think is unfortunate. 

Oh yeah, and you can get bubble tea here. It's not the best bubble tea in the world, its also not the worst. I like to get the taro (hot), long yen (hot)."}
{"text":"Used to be a fan of their Singaporean fried rice!!"}
{"text":"Good, cheap, and very quick food in the Oakland area. Cheaper and quicker than lulus, but quality is a little less than lulus."}
{"text":"Great Chinese take out place. Dine in is also available. It will take less than 10 min to get your order ready. Great General Tso chicken, seafood dishes are great also. The best in town!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!
If you are looking for actual authentic Chinese food, this is the place for you!
You walk into a very nice and clean restaurant.
The staff is very friendly and bring you green tea along with the menu.
I had ordered the beef noodle soup and chicken noodles. They came hot and were absolutely delicious!
This restaurant has really good food, staff, and good for families!! The best part of it all is that it serves halal!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times before and always ordered the vegetable tofu noodle soup because it is a big portion size and tastes delicious. However, the last time I was here I ordered the same thing and there were no vegetables in the \"vegetable tofu noodle soup\" except for a few pieces of iceberg lettuce. I was very disappointed and asked the server if I could have some vegetables for my soup and he begrudgingly gave me literally 4 pieces of broccoli. The service here has always been terrible and after this fiasco I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Almost Zero wait time irrespective of how crowded the place is which is why I love this place!! Good service and sumptuous Chinese food!!"}
{"text":"What more can you ask?

It is at a convenient location, within walking distance from college campuses. It is cheap with large portions, and fast service. Americanized Chinese food, but as a broke college student, it is great for a college budget! Not exceptional, yet not poor. Food is pretty comparable with Lulu's"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service!!!!!!! Lanzhou noodles and the clip bun are to die for. Portions are also very generous. If you are in east end this is the spot for all the hand pulled noodle lovers."}
{"text":"Had the traditional noodles, roasted little lamb leg and the husband-wife tripe and beef slices. Everything was tasty and authentic. Especially happy with the husband-wife tripe and beef slices; it's one of my favourite dishes and many restaurants do not get it right including many other well regarded Chinese restaurants in the suburbs. Also everything was really cheap!"}
{"text":"Portions are generous. Lunch special on weekdays is only 6.75. Pretty good deal for a college student."}
{"text":"It's alright, the restaurant itself smelled a bit, and the vegetarian meat was so chewy. The prices are good, and it was good for leftovers. I don't know if I'll go again though."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food! I had the American style dishes. Exceptional hot and sour soup!"}
{"text":"Decent Chinese takeout or delivery in Middleton.
My Kung Pow was as spicy as they told me it would be (YEAH), all the meals were labeled and equally as described in the online menu.
Friendly phone demeanor, would definitely call again from work next time we are all craving Chinese.
Extra star for phone, delivery speed and extra veggies in my bowl!"}
{"text":"I came back in June and I see that they've updated their menu, noodle refills are now $2 as opposed to free. Regardless the updated menu is easier to read and the price for the soup hasn't changed!"}
{"text":"Was in the area and decided to give this restaurant a try. Best braised beef noodles I had."}
{"text":"Fast and cheap.. not a big fan of the food here.. but pretty good value for money.
I really like the curry scallion pancake though.. can't get enough of those.
Not the best place for asian food near CMU (that would be lulu's).. but a pretty nice place to come once in a while.
Seating is nice.. so good place to catch up with a friend."}
{"text":"The nearest Chinese restaurant near Heinz. Price is reasonable. 
Favor is good. I like fried rice and Chow Fan. 
Can use credit card!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE.

I'm a student at CMU and I used to come here a lot because of its convenient location. The food was subpar for its price and often led to upset stomachs, flatulence, and the itis. 

The main reason I stopped eating here was because I could not stand the extremely rude server named Stanley (he's at the cashier and will take your order 99% of the time). From the multiple times I've eaten there, he has aggressively told me to shut up, denied my requests to order on multiple occasions, and told me multiple times to get out in a hostile manner once I was done eating, all taking into account my attempts of being polite and initiating friendly conversation. Because of this foul treatment, I had every reason to tip next to nothing every time I ate here. I even addressed the cause of the low tip to Stanley, but he never understood and was always unsatisfied calling me words such as \"jerk\". 

After a few times of this, I checked my bank account to see that the amount I wrote on the check was increased by 1 dollar every time I went (I pay with debit card). Summing up all the money, it equated to about 5-6 dollars lost. I let it slide and went back in for another meal. This time, the service from Stanley was horrible. He refused when I asked to order, stepped on my shoes, gave me water with grass and dirt in it, and took the new glasses of water back to the counter when I got up to get new glasses of water. I looked at him in the eyes and said, \"Are you serious? The water you gave me has grass in it.\" He then said, \"Why'd you put grass in your water?\"

I could not believe what I heard, so I just promptly left and will never go back. 

P.S. Their meat is not fresh and who knows what they put in your food. If you want Asian food, I would recommend Lulu's Noodles or Little Asia down Craig Street. It's only a 1 minute walk from this establishment."}
{"text":"I went there with a few friends for a quick lunch. I ordered a vegetable tofu soup and a Shanghai chicken lo mein with vegetable spring roll and fried rice.

I thought the veggie tofu soup would be cleansing and a good balance with my potentially greasy meal. Even though the vegetables were fresh, the soup tasted like chicken broth saturated with MSG, which ruined it.  How do I know it has MSG in it?  It gave me a headache and a dry mouth.

Now comes the Shanghai lo mein. It seems to be no different from the regular lo mein. It was a mistake to order it with fried rice since it made everything super greasy. After finishing the soup, I barely ate any of the main course before asking the waiter to have it boxed. The spring roll was inedible, basically a tube of grease and what seems to be cabbage (I threw it out).

I had the rest of the lo mein/fried rice at home the next day.  Little did I know, they put MSG in it too, giving me another headache.  Thanks a lot, Orient Express.

The service was decent. Not coming back, however."}
{"text":"Quick and consistent Asian fair. Lunch specials are basically pick your dish and add your protein, beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, tofu."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are OK, but you get bored of them very fast. There are more expensive dishes which are good, but the price range is comparable to Little Asia and Eat Unique. If you are considering something $~9, OE (that's what many people called) is not the best place to go. Try Little Asia, Eat Unique, LuLu, or Quiznos.

However, if you want it cheap and a lot of it, OE is the best choice around S Craig."}
{"text":"Great for lunch, spotty for dinner. I generally get their Americanized chinese lunch specials -- which are cheap, delivered terrifyingly quickly and are enormous platters of meat and rice (usually no vegetables). Take out is good and even faster -- given the proximity to CMU, you can get take out lunch probably quicker than many places on campus."}
{"text":"Their Singapore Style Chow Fun is the only reason I'm giving them 3 stars. Every other dish I've tried on the menu (which to be fair isn't that much...but still!) has been very lacking. 

On top of that, service here is so bizarre. The waiters are pretty rude, but in a joking manner, but sometimes I can't tell if they're joking??! I literally just feel super uncomfortable and baffled every time I leave the restaurant. Still come back occasionally though. I do it for the chow fun..."}
{"text":"We decided to check out this restaurant because we found out that they serve Halal meat, which is always exciting.

Upon arrival, you'll notice that the restaurant is hidden away in a small little plaza. When you walk in, tables are already set up with tea pots and cutlery. Our server came to greet us and given that it was our first time there, we had some questions regarding the menu. 

I found him to be in a rush and not really willing to help us. Regardless we were able to make a decision and ordered our pulled noodles. They were pretty good, however I should have chosen a different noodle. 

I would go back again but I'm hoping to get a bit more help next time around the restaurants most popular picks :)"}
{"text":"Authentic Hui food menu. Friendly staff and clean environment. Beef noodles soup was really good. Lamb roast was not my type. I think it was deep fried"}
{"text":"I reallly liked this place. Its a lanzhou hui northern chinese food place. The decor and seating is really nice and definetely an element of authenticity. Also the servers are very nice. The food is also halal hma certified.

I got a number of things to share with my wife and ofcourse regretted it when they came. The food was fantastic and the portions are huge. Needless to say we packed to takr home and i hyperventilated for a long time. 

We ordered these beef buns. They were hot crispy bun with delicious diced cooked seasoned beef.  Then i ordered a noodle soup with slices of beef. The broth was delicious and very hearty abd there was like 2 pounds of noodles in it. Along with that my wife ordered a handpulled fried noodles with beef. Very filling and very good quality. Each of these cost 10 bucks but man each can feed atleast 2 hungry  people. We also ordered a cumin sliced lamb dish that was just fantastic.  

Definetely a place id go back to. F0od is of high quality and items are well prepared and prices are reasonable. Theres also a video running of the owner of the restaurent starting off in china. Good history info."}
{"text":"I'll eat here again since it is so close to CMU. I wouldn't go out of my way to get here, though. I ordered via phone so I could go in and get out. Nope. They gave me chicken instead of tofu. I had to wait an extra 10 minutes (maybe not that long) but it was annoying since i called in so I could get the food and head back out.

The food was GREAT. It was very reasonably priced and the portion was large. I could get two servings out of it. They also did not go light on the vegetables--something other places don't do! The veggies were fresh too, not that frozen, barely thawed stuff."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh and quiet would describe our dining experience. We were looking for a new place to try in the area and stumbled upon this place because they had lunch specials. For $10 plus tax - we both got to eat fried rice, an entree, and two ragoons. And the food was out in less than 10 minutes!

I had the orange chicken and you could tell that it was just fried n steaming. The crust was flaky n the chicken tender. The orange sauce was also sweet and savory. 

My partner had the chicken and broccoli which she said was high quality with a heavier sauce then she is used to. 

The fried rice was unlike we had ever had. It was dark with cabbage, white chicken, and green onions. It was pretty good.

Then the ragoons were mainly cream cheese and very good. 

The restaurant was very quiet (no music) and there was a little girl at another table doing her homework. A pretty laid back environment. 

Overall a very satisfying dine-in experience. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"\"Express\" is a good way to describe this. The speed of service here is sometimes a bit faster than McDonald's, Chipotle etc. 

If you are in the mood for something light - I would highly recommend the Curry Scallion Pancake. 

I thought they were really good value for money until recently when they increased their prices. 

They have a lunch menu where they give you an entree, an appetizer (Vegetarian Spring Roll or Chicken Teriyaki) and rice for $7.99. :)

Although the quality of food is not that great, I would go back there - especially when I have a test the next day and need to spend every minute cramming."}
{"text":"We liked this place better than Chang Jiang and Lee's Garden. It's reasonably priced, good, fast delivery, has orange chicken with a little kick and just over all nice folks and good service.

We will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Not sure why I gave it a high rating, but this one more accurately reflects how I view this establishment. About as average as you can get although I will certainly say I've had better Chinese fare elsewhere. It's probably the closest Chinese place you can get to CMU or even Pitt otherwise. Good for takeout or even for groups. The food is okay ... not particularly mind-blowing but also not bad either. Oily tends to be how I'd describe most food, also not really sure how the cooks are able to get the food out so fast (sketchy, maybe?). Standard Chinese fare ... the Meal Specials are soft on most wallets. Do not get the bubble tea here ... it is indeed quite subpar in terms of tea quality and boba quality (terrible). Bahn Mi & Ti and Fuku are much better places to go for that"}
{"text":"Cheap Chinese food and a lot of it.  

That's all people are really looking for when they come here.  The food is mostly meat in sauce over rice which is $5.50 special during the day.  They have more expensive dishes around $8.

Boba here is horrid.  Never get it.  I couldn't finish half of it.

Service is impossibly fast.  They make it within minutes of you ordering.  The waiters and waitresses aren't particularly nice to you- they have a bit of a dismissive, bored attitude, but they don't ignore you."}
{"text":"i've been here two times, and it seems it gets worst each time. the 1 star seems pretty fitting, this place the noodle and the rice, are not good. the service is fine, but its not special enough to make me give it any higher. 

the noodles i don't particular like the soup or the noodles themselves, they are hand pulled noodles but today in Scarborough there are tons of places that do hand pulled noodles. they are not particularly better then anyone. i'm not sure how close they are to their chinese franchise counterpart they are originally from, but in mind my this place really is not worth the time or effort to try. they are overpriced for what they offer. the cooking is not great at all. the fried noodle i had has a ridiculous portion of green onion and beansprouts. i get it they want to save money, thats probably why they do it. and the fried rice the curry fried rice, that is just pure disgrace. its chicken curry fried rice, where you need a magnifying glass to find the chicken, its basically curry powder with rice, that is the fired rice. 

been here twice and mostly cause my wife likes it, personally i wouldn't recommend to anyone, considering there are so many other noodle joints which have better soup, better noodle, and better price."}
{"text":"Three of my friends and I came here for a quick dinner in between studying and it was ok. As most people are saying, it's pretty standard American Chinese food. We thought the Malaysian satay chicken dish we ordered would have more of a peanut sauce flavor, but it looked and tasted different from other Malaysian satay chicken dishes I've had before. Tasted ok though. The eggplant dish was good, as were the Singapore noodles. The price was reasonable, since the portions were pretty large and we were doing it family style. 

I liked that the food came fairly quickly and it was close to CMU's campus, so we could do a quick meal. I'd go back, but only if I was under a time crunch and needed somewhere close by and quick. It was great though that they had no problem splitting the check for us and we were all able to pay separately with credit cards."}
{"text":"Get the spicy noodle soup and spicy chicken wings....a co-worker brought that and teriyaki tenders to work one day.  I was in heaven!"}
{"text":"Despite its bad reputation among Asian students, Orient Express remains one of my preferred lunch spots in Oakland. The food is okay and price is quite good. Their \"scallion pancake\" is among the best."}
{"text":"After four years at CMU, this is one restaurant that I'm not going to miss.  Their food is mediocre (usually covered in sauce), and the wait staff always seem unfriendly.  However, one upside is that they bring the food out very quickly (usually within 5-10 minutes of ordering), so we just guessed that they have all the ingredients ready on hand and then when an order comes it, just put it in the wok and saute away.  Their bubble tea isn't very good here because 1) it's made from powder mix and 2) their bubbles (boba) are soooo hard, I think they never defrost the tapioca or something. Bleh. 

A good place to go for quick cheap eats especially if you're a Pitt/CMU student, but if you want quality food, definitely go somewhere else."}
{"text":"CHEAP MEALS AT LIGHTNING SPEEEEEED!!!

How do they do it?  I'm not sure that I want to know."}
{"text":"I had two good reasons to be very wary of this place.

1. Having lived in Charles Village in Baltimore, one of the most notoriously terrible places to seek chinese food was at a place named \"Orient Express\"
2. I was craving BBQ Pork, and based on the different non-socal places that I've tried, most of these bbq porks would serve a better purpose being adhered to the sole of a shoe to improve its sping factor.

Having bad connotations with this restaurant name, however, I tried it per the recommendation of a new friend of mine who had been living in the area for a few years already. We went at 9 o'clock one thursday night after class, and the restaurant  was serving 4 other tables.  My friends ordered MaPo Tofu, extra spicy, and I ordered a BBQ Pork Noodle Soup.

I am quite delighted to say that despite their suspiciously brief time to crank out dishes faster than water could boil on an induction stove (a striking similarity to the old orient express i had been to as well), the bbq pork was one of the most tender pieces i have ever had outside of the freshly made bbq pork at Sam Woo Restaurant back in San Gabriel, CA! It was most definitely a pleasant surprise.  The rest of the dish consisted of thicker ramen-type noodles and a few leaves of bok choy.  My friends' mapo tofu didn't quite look like mapo tofu to me, but they enjoyed it anyhow.

I hope to come back sometime for lunch, when the deals are even better!  They split our 3 entree check among 3 cards without complaint."}
{"text":"The food is OK, depending on what you order.  I'd avoid the cheapest special menu.  Compared to the other restaurants near craig st it is pretty good, especially when you take into account it is cheap.   The chow fun is good and the service is fast, but not particularly friendly."}
{"text":"Some amazing shit. Takeout chinese food except it comes out in 5 minutes max, sometimes 30 seconds. I know all Chinese takeout food is unhealthy so I'm not concerned about the health implications OE may or may not have, I just enjoy the food. It tastes delicious and the portions are huge, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"A good value in the very competitive neighborhood lunch-place scene.
I like the food that I get here, which is mostly in the form of takeout lunch specials. The food is fresh and the sauces not as heavy as they might be; if you get the steamed rice the meal end up reasonably light.
I've been less impressed with their soups, which are rather coarse.
Still, it's the closest place to my office and the alternatives don't rate the extra 2 mins walk."}
{"text":"We had lunch here at around 1:30 p.m. on Thursday 18 January 2018 and the place was spotless.  The decor was excellent and authentic.  Jimmy, our waiter was polite and prompt.  We both ordered the Traditional Lanzhou Beef Noodle.  You have a choice of the thickness of the noodles, and we both picked the same, rather on the thick side.  My husband liked it but next time I'll order noodles less thick.  To me they tasted a bit doughy, however the broth, the vegetables and beef were excellent.  It is a bit pricey but I think it was worth it.  There was a wide screen television showing authentic Chinese cooking recipes being prepared which was a lot better than most other restaurants showing CP24!  The reason I only gave a 4 star was because of the restaurant's background music.  It sounded like someone playing a Glockenspiel Xylophone, and it just kept repeating and repeating.  I asked my husband if that was a traditional tune from China, and he laughed and said no.  He said it was the song \"The Sound of Silence\" from the movie  The Graduate.  Listening  to it, I realized it was that tune!   However it just kept playing, so it got kind of annoying. I can imagine how Jimmy and the rest of the staff feel, listening to that all day long!   However, we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I like Orient Express, in fact I'm having lunch here today.  This is noteworthy bc I work by Magee Women's Hospital, and I'm willing to walk all the way down to Orient Express (by Craig Street), and it's 4 degrees outside today.

Orient Express is a great place to lunch when you want inexpensive Chinese food, fast.

Once again my friend argued, \"Orient Express is inauthentic!\"  Okay, we are from Pittsburgh.  Has he ever been to China?  No, he has not.  So I don't know what authentic Chinese food is, but I've seen some people eating some pretty gross food on the travel channels, so I'll pass on it.

What I am familiar with is food that is tasty, which the food at Orient Express is.  The menu is diverse so everyone in your party will be able to find something, vegan, veg, carnivore, dieter, etc.

The food is fast.  I mean FAST.  It will come out in minutes.  I'm going to time how long it takes for the entrees to come out today and update my status.

I always get the General Tso's Fried tofu with fried rice and hot and sour soup.  It's fantastic.  I love fried tofu bc it gives me the illusion of eating something healthy, but it still tastes good bc it is deep fried and covered in sauce.

The service is ok.  You order at the front and the waiters are only responsible for bringing your food out to you and refilling your drink.  I'm pretty sure they don't speak much English, but they have all been pleasant enough.

I give Orient Express two thumbs up, in fact I prefer it to Lulu's noodles bc it is nowhere near as greasy as Lulu's is, and a lot less expensive."}
{"text":"Craig Street prides itself on being full of slightly over-priced takeout options geared towards the students, faculty, and staff of CMU.  Orient Express fits in just fine here, although I probably wouldn't stop in unless I was at CMU.

First, the lunch deals are the reason to come here.  I have never actually gotten the lunch deal, but it's an absurdly good deal.  I think it's $6.75 for a meal, rice, and spring roll or something like that.  You cannot beat it.

I ordered safe when I came here and got Shrimp Lo Mein ($8.55 w tax).  It was really mild and lacked many veggies.  The shrimp was OK, but I would order something else if I returned.  The meal was pretty lackluster, but the takeout was super fast.

All in all, Orient Express will fill the void in your stomach, but there are better Chinese options in Oakland."}
{"text":"Cheap food. Always bustlin'. Hungry for Asian food? Walk down from Carnegie Mellon Uni., and you're there! Closest establishment that had me everyday during lunch.."}
{"text":"I think that this is the closest off-campus restaurant to CMU. The price is fine and you get a large amount of food. The service here is quick and efficient, but no one is very friendly. That's fine, as I hardly ever eat in and only stop by to pick up a meal.

Their bubble tea is pretty good. I especially recommend the mango bubble tea. Also, the chow fun is pretty good as well.

Overall, the food is tasty, the service is quick, and the price is alright. Not bad for a conveniently close restaurant"}
{"text":"Best dumplings in all of Madison, best chinese in entire city! Very impressed. Fast delivery"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible food. The General Tso's checken wasn't chcken, and didn't taste like the General had been anywhere near it. The Teriyaki chicken was cardboard. As other reviewers have mentioned, the food comes out in 5 minutes. However, other reviewers have glossed over the fact that FOOD SHOULD TAKE MORE THAN 5 MINUTES TO PREPARE. Please avoid this place as if your life depended on it....because it might."}
{"text":"Well. The good thing about Orient Express was that it was really close to the CMU campus so just walking down Forbes, you can hit it real easy if you don't want chinese delivery. The dumplings weren't too bad and the orange beef was pretty good too. The beef had a decent crunch to it that paired well with the rice. The food came out really really fast and it was nice and warm. The service was decent. They refilled my water without me needing to ask. They also didn't really care if you brought your laptop in and did some work after eating your food either because they were never packed."}
{"text":"I grew up eating from this place as this was close to home. The lady that runs the place looks exactly as she did when I was 8 years old. LoL! In years the food has changed and not for the better but one consistent item is the crab rangoon. Its always hot, crispy garlicky cream cheese goodness.   I try to make a stop at least once a month."}
{"text":"Standard American Chinese food. Nothing in particular on the menu stands out to me, and I tend to avoid their greasy MSG-filled food if I can, but credit has to be given to their service catered toward university students. Their food is okay once in a while, especially if you're in a rush. That said, it is strange to me how nearly every time the meal is brought out within 10 minutes (5 if you're taking it to go, especially the lunch specials). I try not to think about how much of the food has already been pre-made in the kitchen.

For a sit-down meal, the place is nice in that it usually is not too loud, and there are always available tables; the place is never overbooked. There is always at least one waiter around, so if you need anything they get to you pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Rude behaviour. But expensive considering their mediocre quality. Quantity sufficient."}
{"text":"After living in Oakland a few years, this definitely became my go-to place to eat out. It's a bit pricier than some of the other cheap options for students, but it's well worth it for the amount of food that you get. The staff is friendly, the place has a good amount of seating, and I haven't found any other place that makes hot bubble tea--especially banana flavored. This place is the only reason I like bubble tea now. Their pineapple shrimp is also one of the best dishes I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"OVERPRICED TASTELESS CRAP

I ordered the Mongolia beef which was $11 for about 1 strip of beef a box of onions and some crappy white rice!

You have to be cray cray to go here!"}
{"text":"I really have never been a fan of Chinese fast food, but I wanted to give it a second chance.  This restaurant smelt scrumptious from the outside, plus I skipped breakfast that Saturday and I was starving, I needed something fast!  They had egg-foo-yung on the menu, which is always tempting, but a hit or miss nonetheless.  

I am spoiled by the egg-foo-yung in China town, New York and nothing else stands the test.  So, I went with a staple dish, Vegetable Lo Mein.  

The woman I ordered from smiled from ear to ear and seemed to be thoroughly enjoying her day.  The food was served up with the quickness without a doubt, but the veggies tasted like they had been frozen for a while (the broccoli was kind of brown).  I have to say it wasn't bad for fast Chinese, but I am still not a fan."}
{"text":"The online ordering system is easy to use, and the value you get for the money is decent.  Taste-wise, it's hit or miss.  Fried rice was overcooked, and the shrimp with mushroom was too salty.  However the ho fun was delicious.

Next time I'm in town, I'll try more of their noodle dishes."}
{"text":"It's one of the closest places to CMU, and the fact that I eat there more than once a week speaks loads about its good food. One would get really bored of eating at the same place again and again, but I and my friends end up eating there a lot simply because of the taste. It's not out of the world amazing, but its damn good for the price. Huge portions, lots of veggies and they are willing to cater to your requests (w.r.t. spice, oil etc). The staff is very friendly as well. My favorites are the singapore fried rice, spicy garlic shrimp, spicy chicken leg meat and the lo mien."}
{"text":"OE became my unofficial headquarters during the last two years of college. I went mostly for the bubble tea and the tofu dishes, but all the food is pretty good. (Yes a little greasy, but look, that's just Chinese cuisine, folks.) I usually had enough for leftovers too.

I loved bringing in my laptop to do work (sans-wifi) and watching people pass by through the windows. The servers were very nice (though not necessarily outgoing) and came to know me. I got the impression it was a very hardworking family/group, and I was happy to support them."}
{"text":"After a few more visits for take out, OE is still awesome.  The portions are slightly smaller when you order for take out though.  So maybe they should have a separate take out menu with pricing to reflect it?  I would say the portions are reduced by about 25% than what you get if you were to dine in."}
{"text":"Great service, cute place and good food. Went to try this place out after hearing about it from some friends. I was pleasantly surprised by how homey the interior was considering it's location.

The prices are amazing, as you can definitely share all (majority) of the plates! The food is very appetizing, would have ordered a lot of the dishes I saw go by if I wasn't so full. Oh & the service was amazing! Everyone greets you & doesn't neglect you after you've reached your table.

I ordered the traditional lanzhou beef noodle & it was very good just a tad on the salty side (only reason I think I'd give it a four). I'm not usually one to add to the soup base, but with this one I had no choice but to add chilli sauce. The beef was good & the noodles were chewy! And the portion was really generous. 

Boyfriend ordered the braised beef noodle, solely because he likes spicier food. But really it's the same as just adding plenty of chilli sauce to the soup and changing the meat. Personally we both like the thin sliced beef in my noodles better than the braised beef. It was thicker and more fatty. If that's what you enjoy, then go for that one."}
{"text":"This place is ok,and i haven't been here more than once.But i've given three stars for this place because my friend always goes there and collects fortune cookies for me.
  I collect the fortunes,so most of my papers were from Orient Express.So do go here to get fortune cookies :).I'ts close to CMU and its very cheap.It's a good place to go to when you are really hungry and you want to save some money.Saving is good after all :)

{"text":"Orient express is a convenient place to grab Chinese takeout.

The menu has all of the favorites you expect from a Chinese takeout place, but the cooking doesn't do justice to what the dishes should be.

The restaurant often puts too many vegetables, is conservative on flavor and tapioca powder, and overall really misses the average flare of American Chinese food that you'd expect---it's more like a home style taste than anything.

For example, the general tsos chicken is not fried enough, the sauce is not pungent, and the chicken is dry. The Mongolian beef is just a search for a piece of meat along the onion forest, and the Hunan Beef is a jumbalaya of veggies you don't want to eat.

Convenience is what makes this place, but the dishes are really subpar, even for takeout Chinese food."}
{"text":"The chef here won't ever be in the running for a Michelin Star or a James Beard Award, but Orient Express has some extremely reliable strengths:
1) The service is FAST.  Not necessarily stellar or friendly, but fast.  They take your order and bring the food out extremely quickly.
2) The food is cheap.  It's hard to feel ripped off, especially given the amazing convenience.
3) The experience is consistent.  They'll get you to your meeting/class/nap on time, and the food is reliably just-below-average.  But sometimes that's just what hits the spot, especially when it fits the schedule and budget as well.

If you're looking for a date night place, fine dining, or something absolutely unique or delicious, look elsewhere.  But Orient Express certainly has its advantages."}
{"text":"I initially had a very bad impression of this place before I came. A lot of students view this place as a bit sketchy because of the speed that the food comes out. No matter what we order, food is always on the table in less then 10 minutes. 

BUT despite all these misgivings, my friend decided treated me here, and I'm SO glad I tried it. It is so close to CMU, and although it is not the most \"authentic\" Chinese food there is, it is delicious, fast, cheap, and has ridiculously large portions :) I've come many times after the first initial time I tried it. My favorite dish isn't on the menu--it's called Crispy Sesame Beef, and it comes with broccoli and rice ^^ NOMNOMS.

Oh, and personally, I find OE's pearl milk tea (which comes hot, or cold) a lot better than LuLu's."}
{"text":"With a very few review i was actually having hesitation going here, but my pregnancy craving for soup noodles is too strong that i just have to give it a try. The first thing you would notice is the smell of the food once you open the door, i must say it is good. 

Surprisingly clean and tidy interior with traditional Chinese renovation has set my expectation high. And i am glad that the food is up to expectation. Food tastes good and being cook in traditional style. Big bowl soup noodle is more than enough even thou i am pregnant lol so overall i had a good experience there"}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 3 times for lunch since I started working in Oakland.  As others have stated, the food always comes out fast.  Good prices and nice selection on the menu.  The servers aren't very friendly or attentive and there's not much atmosphere, but the tables are placed well at a comfortable distance from each other."}
{"text":"Pros:
Great hand pulled noodles

Cons:
No English to be found anywhere

I come to the plaza Orient Express is located at because one of my fav Beef noodle joints is here.  Orient Express is a recently new place that took over a Pho restaurant's location.  Their specialty is the hand pulled Lanzhou noodle.  Lanzhou is located in north western China so there is a spicy tangent in their food.

The restaurant is quite large.  There are plenty of tables for 4 here.  They have about 3 or 4 tables on the side that can fit about 6-8 people.  Large groups be wary before coming here.  

The menu consist of a double sided laminated 11 by 17 paper.  One look and you can easily see there is no English to be found whatsoever.  One of my biggest pet peeves with Chinese restaurants is lack of English in menus.  I don't care if 99% if your customer base doesn't need it, if you run a business here, have English on your menus.  

As I stated before, the specialty is the hand pulled noodles.  They also have about 10 entrees that range from chicken, veggies and lamb.  There are some traditional side dishes you can order as well.  If you're not a fan of spicy, there won't be too much too choose from though.

We ordered the noodles and some sides so my review will focus on that.  When it comes to noodles, you can customize them by noodle thickness, spicy level, salt level, and amount of noodles.  My wife and I both went for a thicker noodle.  She went 0 spicy level and I went 1.  We did not change the salt level.  The noodles were excellent.  The portions were pretty good as well.  The broth was a bit on the salty side so I will be changing the salt level is I were to come back, So even if you choose 0 spice, there is still a hint of it so people who don't do spicy need to be careful. 

All in all, I like this place. I like to beef noodle place next door better, but this is a solid addition to the plaza.  If you like hand pulled noodles and aren't afraid of a little spice, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Cheap, Fast Chinese food. Food isn't that great, but the price over takes it. I love going here for quick food. It is a good complement for my busy schedule from CMU."}
{"text":"The second best Chinese restaurant in Madison according to me, the first being Wah Kee Noodles. 

This place does both Americanized Chinese food and real Chinese food, and both are good. The real Chinese menu is right next to the English menu, and it does have English translations of all the dishes. Particularly interesting is the Pork with Hot Garlic Sauce, also known as Szechuan Pork, because it is the most authentic I have had in any city besides Los Angeles, from a Shanghai-nese point of view. 

But who cares about that, it's all good."}
{"text":"When I first heard of Orient Express, first thing that comes to mind was that it was a cheesy Asian fast food joint much like Panda Express, but boy was I wrong!

Yes its a big franchise (400 locations in China!) but its definitely not cheesy Asian!  They serve some pretty mean hand pulled Lanzhou noodles here where the noodles are chewy and the broths are flavourful.

For the soup noodles you get a choice of 8 or so different noodles from round, flat, thin, thick or fat and the best part is that you get free noodle refills with your order!  All for about $10!  

The place was clean and the service really good.  For those of you who eat Halal, the place serves 100% Halal so that is a big plus.

Solid addition for some solid noodles!

4/5!"}
{"text":"It was time to go back - and it was, as always, a flawless experience.  Food was perfect - beef broth had a deep flavour, not overly salty, soft, melt in your mouth meat, good ratio of Chinese kimchi and wonderfully chewy, hand-pulled noodles.  Bouncy and springy - perfect texture.

Shared a bowl (portions are generous) with two salads:  one black fungus salad (my personal fave.) and finely shredded taofu pi (tofu skin).  More than satisfied our appetites and the price was under $25.00.  Can't beat that.  But what makes this experience all the better is the impeccable service.  This is reliable and consistently good."}
{"text":"i am definitely not a fan of orient express. the food is just ok and the boba is disgusting. the tapioca balls served as this place are hard as rock. i might have to add that i am an asian originally from southern ca, where asian food (or generally, food) is just better overall- but i am definitely not impressed with this place. i would rather go to lulu's anyday. however, the review below mine should concentrate more on the specifics of orient express, rather than an attack on asian culture."}
{"text":"Got the general tsos, cooked in way too much garlic and no spice. Over priced, over cooked chicken. Much better options in the area."}
{"text":"Fast, cheap, and (most importantly) DELICIOUS Chinese cuisine.  They offer a ton of dishes, and serve wonderfully varied flavors and styles of boba."}
{"text":"If you go here, you're likely a desperate CMU student who's crunched for time and needs to crunch quickly in between classes and meetings and projects and all the other madness in between. And desperate restaurant goers - like desperate people in the love market, the day-before-Christmas market, and so on - don't have very high standards. And let's be real: Why would you have high standards when you're going to a place with the word \"express\" in its name?

And let's be real again: OE does deliver when it comes to express; it puts the express in OE. For good or bad, I've been to this place plenty of times, and I've made it a game to time how long it takes me to get my order as soon as I've placed the order. My record: 1 minute and 47 seconds. Some may be joyous about this time, others repulsed, and I think being both joyous and repulsed simultaneously is more or less what you'll actually be feeling when you enter, eat, and leave OE.

And maybe OE was able to put my food on the table so quickly because they already knew my order as soon as I walked through that pointless ten-square-foot vestibule that is the OE entrance: Yeung Chow Fried Rice. The Yeung Chow Fried Rice is likely your best bet - at $6.95 and two-meals-worth of fried rice (egg, peas, and carrots) with shrimp, chicken, and BBQ pork, it's the clear winner when it comes to filling your stomach tastily and cheaply.

To conclude: OE has WiFi. I'm not really sure why you would need WiFi when you're going to get your food in less than two minutes, but if you do, the password is (last time I checked) thedarkone. I have absolutely no idea why they made this the password, but there you go."}
{"text":"Americanized Chinese food. OK price, OK quality, interesting staff here. Either totally empty or extremely crowded with Chinese graduate students. Here's the good thing, it's basically on campus for CMU students. So pretty convenient as an alternative to the God-forsaken Asiana (a horrible CMU dining place).

I tried half of their menu. Hot pot is my favorite. Not the traditional Chinese family style hotpot but rather a pot of fishball-veggie-meat-shrimp mixture. Caution: MSG. Fried rice is decent. All the signature Americanized Chinese food are made as they are supposed to be: a little Chinese appearance with the American taste. Bubble tea is really sweet, which I don't mind as some of my friends from China."}
{"text":"This was a delivery that I ordered. It took 40 minutes for our order and the food was below par.The pancakes for my moo shu were like paper.The actual moo shu was average. It was disappointing to say the least. I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I had the braised beef soup, the cold shredded chicken and stir-fry noodles.

The beef stir-fry noodles were chewy and the beef was kind of tough. I stopped trying to eat it after a small serving.

The braised beef soup was flavorful and enjoyable . When the base got low, I asked them to bring some more and they brought more soup base free of charge.

We also had the fried beef dumplings. Those were good.

The shredded cold chicken had very little flavor.

Everything was very greasy.

We were on the other side of the divider in the middle of the restaurant and the waiters never voluntarily came to take our order and see if we needed anything. We constantly had to catch their eyes and wave to get their attention. It was annoying and terrible!

There are a lot of foreign dishes on the menu with no description of what they actually are and maybe only one image per page.

Apparently they have different types of pulled noodles that you can order, but if you want to see what the options are you will have to get up from your table and walk over to the cash register where there are images of the options. Very impractical!

In addition, they don't provide any Forks or spoons to scoop the food up on if you are sharing the dish.

 I honestly probably would not return to this restaurant, the only thing I would recommend is the braised beef soup and fried dumplings.
 

P.s
 They dont take credit card"}
{"text":"Orient express is located on Forbes avenue near the Starbucks on the corner of Forbes and Craig street. This is a great place to grab take out as the service is always very quick. My friend and I came for lunch and was surprised at how reasonable the lunch specials were. I had the general tso's tofu and my friend had the general tso's chicken. The lunch special comes with white rice or fried rice and a chicken skewer or spring roll. The food came out very quickly. Their tofu is nice and crispy and the general tso's sauce has a nice garlic flavor. The chicken skewer was good too. Overall, can't complain as the prices are very reasonable and food is good. The lunch special was about $7.50 and I had leftovers! Orient Express always satisfies the Chinese food craving."}

{"text":"We decided to try Orient Express after hearing that they had restaurants back in China so we were expecting some pretty authentic Lanzhou beef noodles here. The restaurant was decorated nicely and the furniture reminds you of classic wooden Chinese tables and chairs. 

We ordered a Lanzhou beef noodle soup and cucumber cold bean noodles. They came pretty quickly and the noodles were accompanied with a flower tea that was served in a classic Chinese tea cup. Although I generally like all types of tea, the one they provided me tasted a bit off and was not in my liking. The Lanzhou beef noodle soup came in a pretty large portion and would be enough for two people. The noodles itself were hand-pulled and were overcooked slightly. The broth was decent and tasted authentic. On the other hand, I found that although the cold noodle was quite good and was on point with the level of spiciness, it seemed like there was something in the flavour that was lacking in the dish as every bite left me slightly unsatisfied.

Although the food is suppose to be authentic, I found that the classic beef noodle soup wasn't exceptional and worth coming for."}
{"text":"Orient Express is a franchise from China which has over 400 restaurants in China and this is their first overseas franchise location.

Never heard of them online or have their photos appearing on your favourite instagrammer's feed?

I can assure you this is the real deal. Nothing here is gimmicky or pretentious: the quality of food speaks for itself.

Broth has so much flavour and the noodle has such good bite! Their Spicy Chicken in Chili Sauce ($6.99) is so light and spicy!

Will be back again and again to satisfy my noodle craving!"}
{"text":"This was another of the first restaurants I went to in Pittsburgh. Loved it! We actually already had dinner earlier and then went to a prescreening hosted at Carnegie Mellon. It got pretty late, dark, cold and we turned into hungry wolves. 

I was excited to pop in here for my second dinner. I ordered some appetizers to split and the food and sauces were great. I think I got some fried wonton dish and crispy tofu but remembered it being just what we needed before turning in. I imagine the students frequenting this place on account of location and fast service. No complaints!"}

The strawberry bubble tea is awesome, and so is the chow fun. I've never had a bad meal here, and I've eaten here A LOT, seeing as they were so close to my school. They're usually pretty nice about splitting up checks, which is good."}
{"text":"I didnt like the Singapore friend rice once, but I liked it the second time. Its like my friend used to say 1 out of 5 times the chef messes it up. 

But I really liked their noodle soups. Everything is cheap."}
{"text":"The important part about coming here is to realize what this place is good for - a large quantity of food that's quick and cheap and is great for those take-out days when you the college student are overloaded with work and just don't have time to deal with another place. 

Keeping that in mind, I don't worry about the service quality or authenticity of the food or anything like that. When I come here all I care is that I get my food quickly and that it tastes reasonably good. OE definitely has both of those qualities. Whether I order orange chicken or General Tso's or lo mein or chow fun - the food always comes out quickly and always hits the spot.

As a bonus, it's pretty close to CMU campus and definitely better than the Asian options there. If I were still a student, I would definitely keep coming back here for my Chinese take out!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for the gourmet experience of a lifetime, this is totally not the place. But if you want fast, cheap Asian food that is pretty good and smells great, OE is perfect. It's also conveniently close to CMU, so perfect for lunch breaks.

Also, their bubble tea is way better than Lulu's. Just putting that out there."}
{"text":"Orient Express is extremely inexpensive, super fast (usually served with your fresh massive portion in under 5 minutes) and quite tasty.  The food isn't the best on earth, but for the price and speed it's unbeatable.  I especially recommend the hot pot!"}
{"text":"OE. A staple of my college career. I recently came back during CMU Carnival, and it still has not changed. Service is still super quick, the restaurant is no-frills but relatively clean, prices are still rock bottom and my favorite dishes were still exactly how I liked them. $6 lunch specials still? Seems like inflation didn't really hit them too hard. Hard to beat this kind of value.

That said, you have to know what to order here. Some of their dishes are better than others. I usually go with the salt and pepper pork chop, Singapore mi fun, string beans, salt fish chicken fried rice, and beef noodle soup. Again, the food comes out super fast, so you have to wonder if they're keeping it behind doors with heat lamps or something, but regardless, it doesn't taste like it.

I would recommend against the bubble tea here, as the bubbles are a bit harder than most other bubble tea places around. Go to the Rose Tea Cafe across the street, or even Lulu's for better bubble tea. Or just get the tea without the bubbles and you should be okay.

Quick, cheap, relatively high quality Chinese food at a convenient location? Look no further than OE."}
{"text":"Ordered a very simple dish here. Chicken fried rice, and general tso's. Was that even chicken (I asked myself)? Although it had a pleasant presentation, the food wa AWFUL, I'm not sure if there was even soy sauce in the rice. YUCK! General tso's I'm thinking that sauce was straight from the bottle - Lee Kum Kee perhaps? ew! No thanks, I pass!"}
{"text":"Horrendous.  I had walked past this place probably a hundred times before I finally decided to give it a try.  Bad mistake.

I ordered General Tso's Chicken, which was pretty mediocre to begin with (much worse than the General Tso's at Lu Lu's, even).  However, I soon noticed a couple of hairs in my food, one of which was actually wrapped around a piece of chicken.  I complained to the waitress, who took the food and showed it to the chef sitting in the back.  He just shrugged and continued reading his newspaper.  Not even an apology from anyone.  Would never go back here under any circumstances."}
{"text":"I ordered the curry veggie-chicken and it was oily and flavorless. I asked for chili sauce with it and I got oily pepper paste that didn't add much spice to the dish.
Very typical small-town American-style Chinese food. Do not recommend."}
