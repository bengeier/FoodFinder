{"text":"Taffies, please learn how to make iced coffee or don't serve it! The employee was apologetic when he brought it out because it clearly wasn't made correctly. He also only charged me $1.85 rather than the $2.75 menu price. Also, no half and half or sugar free vanilla syrup."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday for breakfast for the first time and had an order of Biscuits and Gravy, my husband had a Kitchen Sink skillet and both were phenomenal! Pancakes were delicious and the service was friendly. Also decided to try one of their specialty drinks, the Iced Caramel Macchiato was awesome! It is so nice to have a small family owned restaurant so close to home. We will definitely be back as well as give great recommendations to family and friends!"}
{"text":"If there's one criticism I could try and make it's that the hash browns are a little mushy, but I've never had perfect hash browns so I can't fault them for that. The tops and edges are crispy and that's my favorite part  the skillets are delicious and everything is such a great value. Haven't tried their lunch but I love breakfast menu!"}
{"text":"Went and grabbed coffee today, got an iced latte but they steamed the milk before putting it on the ice...and the drink was served in a foam cup. Won't be going back for coffee. Friendly staff though and it was clean inside"}
{"text":"Wish it was the Taffies that we knew and loved for decades!  It is not.   It is not even a smaller version.   No fresh baked bread with meals.  Used to be what set them apart from the others. No daily specials.  Used to be home-cooked style food that were delicious! French fries are the mashed potatoes formed into the shape of a french fry, no flavor and not what they used to have! Grilled Chicken salad...used to be huge...and had boiled eggs, chicken, tomatoes....  No eggs now!  And small salad.  No cracker bowl, no bread! Sad!!   Unfortunately the new owners decided to cut corners once they purchased it.  The food quality suffered, maybe that's why they closed down in Champaign?  The server was kind, no complaints about him.  Might give them one more chance, even though it is a little drive.  Please, Taffies....Come BACK!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday to get dessert to go. Great homemade cookies and THE best cinnamon   rolls ever.!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate breakfast there and in short, it was amazing. I had the Kitchen Sink Skillet and my wife had the Taffies special. Both were cooked to perfection. Fluffy eggs, crisp bacon, crisp hash browns, lots of cheese and gravy. The biscuits were hot and fresh and reeked of homemade goodness.   The service was also super friendly and made numerous trips to make sure the coffee was topped off (by the way their Columbia Roasteries private blend is delicious).      Will we eat here again? Yes! Will we invite and suggest to other? Certainly!"}
{"text":"I won't be back.  I loved the old Taffie's Diner when it was in Champaign.  It was old school.  They had counter service and old crappy booths and staff who were fast and efficient and they had reasonably priced homestyle food in addition to breakfast all day and sandwiches.  They had pie.  Oh lord have mercy did they have pie.  You could pick from one of at least 4-5 different varieties each day.  It was close to work.  I could go there by myself for lunch when I was having a bad day and read my book and eat comfort food and feel better before I went back for the afternoon, so I was bummed when they closed.  The old building was in disrepair, it was getting too expensive to operate and I think they were just ready for a change.  I happened to be in Mahomet and thought I would stop by the new Taffie's Cafe out of nostalgia.  I knew vaguely where it was, but the signage isn't the best and the parking is weird, so I had to drive around the block twice to figure it out.  It is WAY smaller.  And mother have mercy it was hot.  I took a booth and ordered my iced tea.  They have a tv playing soap operas in the middle of the day?  Not sure what that is all about...  Anyway...  The menu was desperately smaller, too.  Now they only offer breakfast and burgers/sandwiches.  All the yummy 'mom style' comfort food was gone from the menu.  Boo.  I got a 1/2 grilled cheese and chili which was good.  The server was tremendously kind and eager, if not very knowledgeable.  And pie?  Well, I heard the table next to me inquire (the only other table there besides me) and heard him tell them that they were out of that type of pie.  So I was curious and asked what kinds they DID have.  He had to go check.  They had apple.  Period.  Sad panda. Zero options.    I paid and left and won't return.  It's not the same and what it is now isn't worth my time."}
{"text":"Let me be honest -- we weren't fans of the old location. We'd eaten there a couple of times years ago and thought the food was sub-par and the atmosphere worse. Since Taffies opened in Mahomet (we're locals) we've been a few times for breakfast. We've been pleasantly surprised with most of the food and the overall experience. We're glad to keep coming back.   The interior is clean and modern, although small. The ceiling is high, which gives the illusion of more space, but contributes to the noise. The restaurant is far noisier than it otherwise might be because of the unfortunate acoustics -- even the busing can be ear-splitting at times. The service is almost always friendly and attentive (except for our last visit, when it took a very long time for the server to take our order or pour our coffee).    As for the food, the best thing we've had is the pancakes. We love them. They are big, fluffy, and have great flavor. The syrup and butter are also tasty and of good quality. I'm also a big fan of the link sausage. The coffee and bacon are good quality and well prepared, too.   Food we haven't enjoyed as much include the hashbrowns -- these are the pre-frozen, string variety. They pick up too much grease and fry unevenly on the grill (with some charred spots and some underdone areas). Also, the southwestern skillet. The chorizo in the skillet wasn't traditional -- no heat, just cumin, and so much cumin the sausage tasted like cumin sausage more than pork sausage. Really hard to eat. Finally, the omelet. The eggs were either overbeaten or poured from a liquid egg source -- too refined and thin for a fresh-egg omelet texture. Taffie's eggs (even in a separate scramble) are a bit bland. Also, very little cheese inside and too few onions, meant that the odd bits of ham were the only filling with taste and not enough of that either.   In general, I recommend adding a dab of butter to eggs (please use fresh eggs) when they cook and adding seasoning at the end to improve the flavor."}
{"text":"Came back to try again, and no soup.  So their half soup/half sandwich menu option is null.  Only a matter of time this place is gone, it is poorly ran."}
{"text":"BEST pancakes. We love breakfast here. Portion size is good. My son loves the build your own burgers. My daughter and I love the coffee selection. New favorite place to eat in town. Only down side is they close at 2 pm."}
