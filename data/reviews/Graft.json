{"text":"Delicious meal, helpful and friendly and attentive wait staff, reasonable prices. I really couldn't ask for more. The oyster po boy is a must have."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The food was delicious and innovative, the staff were friendly and helpful, the ambiance was lovely. I give them 4 stars just for high prices given the tiny portions."}
{"text":"The food, service, and drinks were all great!! There was a little bit of a wait for our food so one of the owners comp'd us desert, but it was also worth the wait either way because the food was awesome!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed dinner here-- shared 3 dishes and samples 2 wines and 2 beers-- great service and very good food-- steak tartar , shrimp and grits and brussel sprouts-- nice ambience too"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Everything from the food to the atmosphere and the service was incredible. The wine list is phenomenal and the cocktails are tasty too! The small plates each had their own unique flavors. Our favorites were the scallops and red snapper. Both cooked to perfection. Despite having no room for dessert, we couldn't resist and were not disappointed. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu! Great options for vegetarians as well! Since everything is cooked and prepped when ordered, it was simple to abide by any dietary restrictions. The BEST part of this gem??? They source all foods that they can locally and create as little waste as possible. Awesome concept. I appreciate their efforts for sustainability while being creative with food preparation. The prices are definitely reasonable. I also thought the \"small\" plates were generous in their portions. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who appreciates great food and excellent wine in a beautiful environment."}
{"text":"Gorgeous, spacious venue. Impeccable service. Delicious, creative food beautifully presented. I cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience at this restaurant.  We went with a mid sized group and tried nearly all of the small plates together, as well as some craft cocktails. Every item was new, different, and refreshing. The executive chef came out to tell us about each item and it's inception.   The bartender made us mystery cocktails when requested and we were all impressed with our drinks and his skill.   This restaurant is a unique addition to downtown Madison."}
{"text":"Food and service were fantastic!  First time at this gem and we already booked 2 more reservations. Must try the shrimp and grits, scallops, big eye tuna, short ribs, Brussel sprouts, and pasta dishes.  The carrot cake and chocolate desserts were delicious. Could not have better service and the atmosphere is amazing.  I wish we could have ordered the entire menu! We can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Wow insane amazing!! Sam - Scott- Tabitha - Edward- Peter and CHEF r amazing!! Food was so delicious - wine \"holy cow\" and service was rockstar -Go - go now!! Will be back soon!!!! Cheers cheers!!"}
{"text":"Nice setting. quite a hip place on the main square.  Cocktail list is great. the wine list is extensive if a bit on the pricey side. Food is small plates and very nicely done. lots of taste and nice for sharing with friends.  The service that night was a bit loose I'd say. I mean there were a lot of staff on hand but no one seemed to be really in charge which lead to confusion and unusual waiting times for bread for example or food delivered to the wrong table.  In conclusion Graft is a nice restaurant for small bites and drinks. I will go again hoping the service efficiency has improved"}
{"text":"I had drinks this evening while my friend dined but would like to give a HUGE thank you to both the manager, Christopher, and the server assistant (didn't get his name but was in the back room around 9/10 pm on Fri. Oct. 7th) for going above and beyond in the service department.  Christopher found a phone charger for me and the male server assistant was kind beyond belief... brought my phone back to me once fully charged, brought me #'s for local cab companies as well as a business card with the address (without asking).  Customer service was impeccable, rare, and much appreciated.  Thank you!!!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say that 5 stars doesn't! From the moment I walked in the place when I was greeted by an owner who remembered me like an old friend after only a few visits that were so many months ago, to the spectacular service and amazing food, I can now say this is a true gem in the dining scene of Madison! Gracious service and wonderful food that is presented by varying knowledgeable staff, makes for an incredible dining experience. Not even going to describe the food because you need to experience it yourself! So many things I didn't think I would like just blew my tastebuds away! Take a few friends, order a variety, and share! Your tastebuds will thank you!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Consistently good every single time. The staff is incredible and very friendly. We enjoy our time here the many times we've gone. A gem for Madison!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Steak ($48) and Chicken($21).  The steak for was good 7 out of 10 but for the money wouldn't order it again.  $50 steak should melt in your mouth.  The chicken on the other hand I can say was the best chicken I have ever had 10 out of 10, delicious.   Cocktails were decent.  Disappointed that there was no craft beer on hand (seriously, get with program) but we ended up at HopCat to satisfy that need. I would definitely go back and recommend this at least once while visiting Madison."}
{"text":"The food here is not impressive. The restaurant looks  great and you think you're in for a treat, but manage your expectations or you'll be disappointed.  Tuna tartare - I did appreciate the saltiness of the rice chip, but like every tartare I've tried, I found it boring. In fact, everything I tried here was boring, or done poorly. The artichoke dish was overpowered by lemon, and same with their pot de creme (I guess they like lemon). Cake was dry, dessert was amateur."}
{"text":"Graft is exceptional! 5 Stars in all areas. I will find a way to return. Truly a great experience."}
{"text":"The very attentive wait staff was actually a bit suffocating. Not the worst problem to have. Ambience was outstanding, restrooms wonderful and of course the food was exquisite. The music needed some help, as it was not the mellow background sounds one would prefer. Probably better suited for the bar crowd and not the dining crowd. Appreciate the avid use of local growers and purveyors of meats and vegetables. Affordable good wines by the glass were plentiful. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ate at Graft on a very busy Saturday night with my husband and 15 y.o. son. It was an amazing meal! We decided to try many different things on the menu and ended up having 12 of the small plates. When you dine with a 15 year old boy, the plates just need to keep coming! Our favorites were the scallops, the snapper, and the ravioli. But, quite honestly everything was outstanding. The food is top rate, but the service is even better. We had 5 different people servicing our table. It was so well coordinated we could not figure out how they did it. We cannot wait to take our vegetarian daughter here as there are a number of excellent vegetarian dishes. Oh, and did I mention that it has a super cool vibe and great location on the Capitol Square. Well done Graft!"}
{"text":"Took my family there for my wife's birthday.  We were all pleased.  I didn't know if I would like the small plate setup, but it worked out great for us.  We did order the large plate half chicken also.  Our other selections were the bread plate, fried chevre (goat cheese), oyster po boy, pork belly, tagliatelle (shrimp,peass, basil, white wine sauce) and last but not least it was Tuesday, so we had the Tacos.  We even took an order to go.    The manager and the wait staff were very attentive without being overbearing."}
{"text":"The service was amazing. We were warmly greeted and seated in a matter of seconds, despite the restaurant looking busy from the outside. Our server and our server's assistant we're both super polite and they even made some awesome conversation with us as they recommended dishes and promptly served our food. I love the fact that the small plates come out as soon as they are prepared! It's great for making you feel like (forgive my corniness) you're on a tasting adventure. My boyfriend and I shared the fennel salad, the Brussel sprouts, the mac n cheese, and my boyfriend had the pork belly because I don't eat meat. They were all divine. Each and every server, host, and employee in the facility paid attention to us, filling up our water as they walked by, or taking our unused plates and silverware. They really made us feel like part of a family. Get the pot de creme! We even got invited back for Taco Tuesday. Best dining experience we've had in Madison!"}
{"text":"We went to graft to celebrate my mom's birthday and we're so glad we did.  We were greeted by the hostess who not only was polite and professional, she was extremely accommodating since we had a two year old with us.  The owner, Lucas, came by our table on many occasions to check on the food, interact with my two year old and sincerely care about our experience.  The tuna tartare was wonderful and we also enjoyed the pheasant, the brussel sprouts, the heirloom tomato salad and i loved my ribeye.  The only reason I didn't give Graft a 5 was the fact our meal took two hours due to the waitress taking a long time to check on us and move on to the next part of our meal.  The bus boy was on top of his game though and was much more assertive than the waitress which almost made up for her.  The restaurant was well decorated and we sat in the wine room which had an amazing barn sliding door and a view to their cellar.  I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Wonderful new restaurant in Madison. Chief Rodriguez fusion of flavored on small plates is wonderful and very imaginative. If your a foodie on a trip to Madison I wouldn't miss it. Nice selection of vegetarian options. Only draw back presentation and wait staff were obviously still in the shake out phase, but don't miss it."}
{"text":"Graft was recommended by a local, so when we came to visit Madison decided to try it. Each dish was superb, especially the shrimp and grits and the pasta dish, but each one unique and delicious. The waitstaff was knowledgeable and friendly and the restaurant space very attractive. Great value for your dollar, too! Make reservations, because the place fills quickly!"}
{"text":"The good: First, the food was tasty and the staff was very friendly, helpful, and conversational.  Second, the large plate NY strip steak was thick although slightly over done for my medium-rare tastes (medium). Third, the Zinfandel by the glass was very good. Finally, Graft allowed us an abundant amount of time for visiting with our friends and enjoying our meal.   The not so good:  First, the portion size on the scallop small plate was very small...$15 for three very small scallops was way too pricey.  Second, the three tiny bits of cheese on the beet small plate left that dish lacking and didn't add enough of a \"taste contrast\" to the wonderful beets. Third, it would have been preferred that I be asked how I would like my steak done rather than giving it to me medium (but also somewhat my fault for not addressing that when I ordered). Fourth, the noise level was very high for trying to carry on a conversation.   So I gave this only 3 stars (really 3.5 stars) because I expected fewer \"not so good\" items for the prices charged at Graft.  I hope they make it though as the staff was friendly and the restaurant has good potential."}
{"text":"Beautiful new addition to Capitol square in Madison. Many great wines by the glass and a wonderful variety of sharing plates, creative vegetable dishes, well prepared proteins like harissa chicken thigh over cous cous, spinach salad with crispy egg and the most decadent lemon pot de creme, could have used a few more fresh berries..can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Quality of the good is top notch. Quantities are small so I wouldn't recommend to anybody looking for quantity over quality or starving after skipping lunch. As a digestive, I strongly recommend the green chartreuse."}
{"text":"We were first timers and everyone at Graft made us feel welcome. Small but efficient food selection that was excellently prepared."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of dining at Graft and had a fantastic experience. The food was outstanding bearing familiar flavors but with their own special take (the Graft mac and cheese made of spaetzle was out of this world; I could have eaten an entire pot of the stuff!).The portion sizes were generous and the prices reasonable. You'll leave fully satisfied without breaking the bank but also get to try several dishes. The chef and his staff work tirelessly behind the open kitchen cranking out these delicious plates.  The design of the restaurant is beautiful and though it's a big space, feels intimate and cozy. You would feel equally comfortable dining at Graft wearing a pair of shorts or a coat and tie for a special occasion. The staff were attentive without being intrusive and were very knowledgeable about each dish. The husband and wife proprietors were great and made you feel at home and welcome from the moment you walk in. The bartender was the consummate service professional with a clear passion for quality cocktails. With a full restaurant and bar, the noise level was perfect; just the right amount of sound to make it lively but I could speak in a normal voice and be heard perfectly. And just above the background sound music played from a well selected set of vinyl albums spinning on a turntable at the bar.  Graft is that rare blend of finely crafted food and drink combined with a beautiful space that fits any occasion. Go with ten of your friends for a birthday celebration; bring your significant other for an intimate anniversary dinner and sit in one the booths; go with your parents when they're visiting for the weekend; have that business dinner with clients; or sit at the bar solo and chat with the other patrons or the friendly staff. Whatever the occasion, Graft is the place! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I chose Graft for our anniversary. I'm from Madison and haven't been back in a while, so when I saw a newer restaurant downtown it sparked my interest. I read so many good reviews and it definitely didn't fall short of my expectations. Our Uber was running late so we were about 10 minutes late for our reservations, which is why we probably were sat next to the kitchen, which normally rub me the wrong way, but I'm actually glad we did because the kitchen staff was just so sweet and even offered for us to try something on the house because it was our anniversary. The hostess was even extremely sweet and helpful.  Our waiter was very nice and made great recommendations. I got the scallops and Brussels sprouts which blew my mind because they were so good. My boyfriend got the shrimp & grits and garganelli pasta which were also super good. You definitely will want to get multiple plates to share because the quantities are smaller, but the waiter made sure to let us know how it all worked before we ordered which helped us out a lot. We both got cocktails which were a little small for the price, but nevertheless amazing.   The atmosphere was very unique, the staff was phenomenal, and the food followed suit. I'd definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Finally got to visit Graft, and we ended up being sorry it took so long. My wife and I have been fans of the small plate concept for a long time, and Graft does a great job. Starting off with the cocktail menu, the Profligate Potation was an eye opener. The taste is not what you expect from the appearance, very refreshing, and the gin and watermelon ( sorry I don't remember the name ) number, my wife had, she pronounced as the perfect summer cocktail. The plates we sampled out of the veggie column were not all that 'small'.  The brussel sprouts with pumpkin seeds are a definite hit, and the jasmine rice salad was excellent as well ( where did that hint of heat come from ? ). The scallops are about as good as any I've ever had.  My only ( minor ) complaint was the oyster po-boy.  I should have asked about the size of that, and ordered two !  This and desert ( excellent lemon/blueberry cheese cake and a great butterscotch pot-de-creme ) was as far as we got, . . . this time. We will definitely be back to explore some more.  Almost forgot a shout out to the service staff.   Our couple ( apologies to them for not being able to remember their names ) did a good job, especially considering that mid-way through our meal, they got to deal with a 13 top bachelorette party.  Oy.  They still have my sympathies on that gig."}
{"text":"Spectacular place. Went with a large group of 15 people and they gave us our own area where we were close together and wouldn't disturb other groups. The service was incredible, every need was taken care of and they did a good job of ensuring everyone was happy. I will say that this is not a restaurant to bring children. We had 5 in our group and they did fine, but was hard to find food that they really wanted to eat.  The food was very well done. Having tapas for the table made it enjoyable everyone. You could try something but if you didn't want it, then they were free not to try. I would highly recommend the Oyster Po-boy and Quail."}
{"text":"I'm going to jump right into the food and drinks with this review.    Drinks: My date and I started off with cocktails.  I ordered the Ultra Violette (Arette blanco tequila, Crème de violette, prickly ash tincture, maple, lime juice) and I have to admit that I have never loved a cocktail as much as this one.  It was perfectly shaken, the flavors were utterly paradisiacal, and I've never said that about any drink I've ever ordered.  My date got Huey Lewis and Dewar's (Dewar's blended scotch, Luxardo maraschino, orange shrub, lime juice, salt).  All I have to say is the bartender knew his stuff because both drinks were BOMB.      Food: I'm not going to lie and say that the menu was unique or creative.  Everything on there you can find in most fine dining establishments.  But I will say that if a chef knows how to cook food the way it should be cooked, they don't need to execute elaborate techniques or use exotic ingredients.  My philosophy is, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"  With that said, here is a rundown of our order:   Fried Chèvre (honey, black pepper gastrique)---Chèvre had a light batter, so light it was barely there, but once cracked, the cheese just softly dissolved on my tongue.  I don't normally like the taste of goat cheese but this was heavenly.     Oyster Po-boy (cabbage slaw, okra, hot sauce)---The oyster was battered and fried to absolute perfection.  I wasn't sure about the okra, but the flavors blended well and it worked.    Scallops (sunchoke, arugula, cippolini, black truffle)---These scallops melted in my mouth. No rubber texture here. Honestly, I've never had a better scallop.    Beef Tartare (shallots, cornichons, croutons, egg emulsion)---This is the one item that strayed from it's classic exemplar.  Graft's version of steak tartare isn't traditional, but I had to try this dish again after a less than stellar experience at a French bistro in MKE.  Although this version was less conventional, it was much better than the tartare I had before.  This cut of beef was so delectable.  They lightly sear the outside of the meat first.  And yet, the temperature was not too warm, the flavor was exquisite, and I liked the egg emulsion more than having a raw egg on top of the meat.  The crouton to meat ratio was off in my opinion, so we used the baguette from our bread plate to eat with this.    Pork Belly (grilled asparagus, pickled mustard seeds, szechuan peppercorns)---I've noticed pork belly has become a rising trend in several restaurants over the last 5-10 years.  And so it was no surprise to me that it made it's way onto this menu.  And really, there's nothing special about it other than it tastes effing amazing, especially when it's prepared right.  I just wanted each bite of this to sit in my mouth for as long as possible.  The asparagus was cut sifflet style and added crunch while the pickled mustard seeds and peppercorns added zing.  Graft mac & cheese (buttermilk spätzle, gouda, breadcrumbs)---This was probably the only thing that didn't blow me away.  The dish was quite heavy and literally felt like I was eating Velveeta shells and cheese. Nothing noteworthy about this dish.       Short rib (cauliflower, port, horseradish)---Pretty standard short rib, but very good.  The meat fell apart effortlessly and the flavor was rich.   Desserts: Pot de Creme (butterscotch, caramel, pecan tuile)---If you like butterscotch this is right up your alley.  But if you love the satisfying feeling of breaking through the sugary crust of crème brûlée you will be disappointed.  The crunch that compliments the crème is in the pecan tuile.  This was a super delicious ending to a great meal.      Experience: You have to make reservations or you will probably not get seated, particularly on a weekend.  We sat right by the kitchen which was fun because we got to see the chefs work their magic.  We were also seated across a really obnoxious painting that just didn't seem to fit with the vibe of the restaurant.  The bathrooms were very nice, and I liked that there was an area for just washing up.  It was a great concept if the sinks actually worked.  Our service was good.  Even though our food was brought by several different people, everyone was always pleasant and knew what was in the food and described it well.  Our bill came out to just about $100 and that's not bad at all for the quality of food and service we received.  I've paid much more at other places for worse dining experiences.  The half circle booths and intimate lighting made for a charming first date.  This was actually one of the better fine dining experiences I've had in a very long time."}
{"text":"Found the service here mediocre. Food was good but small plate portions were terribly small. With all the good choices in Madison there was nothing here that would draw me back a second time."}
{"text":"Such an excellent little place. Have spoken with the chefs and they are so passionate about good food. They know where everything came from and are really connected to their work."}
{"text":"Was OK.  Expected much more based on reviews.  And we enjoy small plate restaurants, so looked forward to trying a variety of food.  Overall, the food could be brought up a few notches.  Service was slow & at times felt non-existent.  Drinks were pretty good.  Extensive wine options.  As well as scotch, etc menu.  Oyster Po-boy was excellent (crispy, flavorful, perfect size).  Brussel sprouts were pretty good but way too large serving size & after a few bites the charred flavoring became a little overwhelming.  The beef tartare was not good: presentation was unappealing: seared (?) chunks of beef in a pile that looked like canned pet food or spoiled meat.  Because of sear, texture was too chewy/tough.  The flavor was ok, but I would never order that or raw meat here again.  Fried goat cheese, always a good idea & nice flavor profile but execution off a bit: needs to be smaller sizes (of essentially fried cheese balls), because you lose the lovely light outside crunch quickly and the feel like you took a huge spoonful of cheese spread & just ate it plain...next more texture variation.  Tagliatelle was good, light flavoring, though overall seemed like it needed additional seasoning or texture...or something.  I could have cooked it (eg basic).  Desserts were ok, underwhelming.  Bottom line: I might consider coming back with grouo if the focus was on a place we could all sit, have a drink or two, and didn't need a full meal but just a few bites (definitely of the po boy!).  Hope they can continue to improve."}
{"text":"We had a birthday celebration last night & was so happy we could all get together. Our food, service, drinks were FANTASTIC! We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"So delicious!  Scallops, Mac n cheese, short ribs....all amazing. Super great service and our food came quickly!"}
{"text":"Graft was amazing! The ambiance, the food, the service...all fantastic. My husband and I were out for a rare date night and can't wait to go back. Started with cocktails and the fried chèvre and both were on point! The fried chèvre was so decadent it could have easily been served as dessert!  Our waiter recommended the ravioli and the half chicken so we ordered both along with the flank steak. Steak was cooked to perfection and the ravioli had a rich blend of flavors.   The star of the night truly was the half chicken. We have never had chicken taste so much like chicken! Again cooked to perfection and was so juicy and tender. Paired with the potato purée and the mushrooms it was a party in my mouth! Highly highly recommend the half chicken.   I was worried that there wouldn't be enough food as the small plates are pretty small. But it was the perfect amount of food and we both left feeling full without feeling like we needed a nap. Go to Graft! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Simply outstanding, food, service, atmosphere, plus a great wine list! An excellent well rounded food experience!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service. Patrick was very helpful. The scallops are amazing! Had a great time"}
{"text":"The decor was modern/ contemporary and I liked that a lot.  The barman new I was on a first date and kindly gave my partner and self a free sparkling wine.   I wanted a cheap wine and that's what I got lol but the manager swapped it out for an more expensive one at my request and didn't charge for the former (nice touch).  I did want the Chablis but it was the ONLY wine not in stock!   Our waiter was very entertaining in a weird way, more due to his personality than anything.  However, I tipped him well and appreciated his willingness to serve.  The food we ordered came on small plates, 3 vegetable and 1 meat dish. Not enough for 2 people but we weren't sure what to expect and the small number of larger dishes seemed not so much the focus on the menu.  The vegetables were fresh, innovative and creative in nature and the beef was very tender. The dessert was yummy too!  Great place to eat great service not sure about the wine.  We will go back!"}
{"text":"Friday night at Madison's hottest new restaurant, and let me tell you like it was.  First,  it was packed, and VERY VERY noisy, I had to shout to talk to my table mates.  Second, we arrived at 6:30, can't recall when our drinks arrived (7PM?) but our first plates ($3 for 6 SMALL pieces of bread) arrived at 7:20.  The second round of plates arrived at 7:40.  Grits and an egg, which was good but strange.  The bread was long gone, so there I am eating just grits, and an egg.  The third round arrived at 8 PM.  I got the mac & cheese, which was cold; not lukewarm, COLD.   I got heartburn --- probably from drinking beer on an empty stomach and the weird parings becasue who eats grits and an egg on a Friday night and 20 minutes later cold mac & cheese?  Also got a sore throat from shouting and my clothes smelled like I had been in a cheap diner.  (But of course this place is pretty expensive, given the small portions.)  Oh, the wait staff -- there were four or five different people throughout the evening taking our order, bringing food and drinks clearing stuff away -- who is our server?  Who's service do we base our tip on?  They got orders mixed up, who get's what again now? I found it discombobulating.  Bottom line, I did not enjoy the expereince at all."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and food Service patchy from great to varied Seemed to get frazzled as more customers arrived"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that is excellent in its style: Small Plates.  These are well-prepared small servings to share with largely great service.  If there's a line at the Old Fashioned, don't go here.  You were trying to get a 2 lbs steak with a cup of butter on it, so the tuna tartare with rice crackers isn't going to going to seem disappointing.  That said, they do have some large plates (one of which is a steak), but I don't know how good it is.  The best comparisons are Cento, Icon, and Heritage (they all have different vibes)."}
{"text":"One word for our dinner last night, disappointing. There were three of us last night, and while the restaurant was beautiful, the food and service was meh. We ordered the red snapper which was good. Then all went down hill.   - First of all our server seemed disinterested and uninformative, I had to ask how many items people order of each of the small plates for dinner, which for new diners there you would want to inform how to order and ask if we had questions. - The small plates are really small -  Coffee flank steak was good, didn't have any of the coffee flavor we read about and was lukewarm - Smoked trout rillette came out in a jar with a few crostini, not nearly enough to actually eat the jar. No sign of the creme fraiche.  - The ravioli came out cold with three tiny ravioli for $12 - Steak tartar was just ok, it would have been nice to have crackers or something to eat it with.  - Our last item, the brussel sprouts were the best item all night. It came out when we had finished everything and was the last thing we had. I know they take a while but really 45min? - We ended up ordering the bread service, and when it came out it was missing the baguette the menu stated, and just had what looked like my grandmother's tiny dinner rolls. Neither the server nor the person who gave us the rolls mentioned anything about the baguette when they brought it, only when we asked the server did she say \"oh, we might be out\" a good thing to have known before we ordered! We asked if there was crostini or some other bread, or crackers for our steak tartar and the rillette, we were informed there was no other bread, crackers at all, what?    We were planning on ordering a third round of food, but our server rarely checked on us, and by the time she did, we had given up and decided to go elsewhere for more food and better service. Maybe they are still working out the kinks but at $50 per person with tip, it was not worth it. If you want to go to a tapas place with great service, in a beautiful setting, head to Estrellon instead."}
{"text":"\"I don't always do Yelp reviews, but when I do it is because the place is AWESOME!\" Dining here right now. If you don't like great food and great service, go elsewhere. The menu might seem \"simple\", but once you start tasting it you'll be blown away!"}
{"text":"The bartender was awesome.  Excellent bourbon and whiskey selection.  Wait staff was in top of it.  We had small plates, which were all amazing.  The kitchen even sent out something special at the end.  Overall, it was an excellent experience."}
{"text":"I'm visiting Madison on business and stumbled upon Graft on a walk near my hotel. In the mood for a light dinner, the small plate concept seemed perfect.  The meal was delightful. The restaurant is only a month old, and there are some evidences of a team still learning to work together seamlessly. That said, there is evident heart in this endeavor. The service was prompt, attentive, and helpful. Both the manager and owner stopped by to check in on my experience. My server was well-informed on the menu and wine pairings.   The food itself was indeed small portions, but they were well-executed and tasty. Since I was looking for a light dinner, I left satisfied with 2 plates (fried chèvre and walleye) and 3 would be a typical dinner portion for me. Unlike another reviewer, I had no concerns about temperature or plating so perhaps they've learned.   The facilities are beautiful and the noise level is energizing but not annoyingly loud. I wouldn't hesitate to return on a future trip to Madison or to come here on a date night or with friends if I were a local."}
{"text":"Great place. Wonderful food, good cocktails. The bread plate is to die for."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Madison. Believe me I have eaten at nearly every hip place in town. The food is delicious - five of us split mostly vegetarian plates. The charred kale topped with egg was delicious. The fried chèvre was unique and favorable. You had to appreciate - the skin of the chicken thigh was made into chicken skin - chips. Our server was the most entertaining wait person I have ever had serve me. The chef actually came to chat up our party of five,The food, the staff, and the environment are so damn genuine you want to move in. Oh yeah, the dessert melted in my mouth! Smores and Almond Cake. I will certainly be back. It is worth the price."}
{"text":"Hands down the most amazing delicious dinner I've had in Madison, and they were amazing at making sure everything was gluten free."}
{"text":"Food was Great!! Salmon was cooked perfectly. The MAC & Cheese was the best I've had in a long time. No wait for seating and great view of the capital building.   Bathrooms are open concept....be prepared."}
{"text":"A very refined and elegant addition to the downtown dining scene. The space itself is understated but very calm, comfortable, and pleasing. The themes here are small plates and wine. We first dined here last year, just after it opened. We started out with cocktails made with seasonal ingredients. They were creative and refreshing on a warm day. The wine list is small but well chosen, with some unique offerings. Most of the dishes work very well. In particular, the Brussels sprouts and red snapper (no longer on the menu) were intensely flavorful. Only one dish was a misfire: walleye and \"beer granola\" (again, no longer on the menu). The attentive and informed wait staff was eager for our feedback, both positive and negative, as were the owners, who came by our table twice during our meal to chat. Fast forward to this past Saturday, when we had dinner with friends visiting from Chicago, all of whom were very complimentary (the beets and pork belly, in particular, drew raves).  Again, the dishes were creative, intensely flavorful, and well executed. The wait staff is very informative and attentive, but not overly so, and they do not push you along to turn over the table (our dinner with a group of six lasted nearly three hours). I am very pleased that Graft has maintained this high level of cooking and service since it opened. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"One of our finest dining experiences. We felt like royalty as the staff attention was spot on: well-informed, attentive, and there when we needed them. It seems like a much more intensive job as wait staff to deliver multiple small plates rather than one entree. The small plates are ideal for sharing. It is a great experience to be able to sample so many different delights in one meal. The dishes were all made with simple ingredients but with incredible panache. The salt cod special included tiny home made chips which made us giggle with delight. The creamy fried chèvre almost had the texture of truffles. Papardelle  were cheesy and dressed in a medley of mushrooms. Tuna tartare offered us a cooling sushi grade tuna accompanied by flowing white rice chips. Our dinner partners were still raving about the Graft macaroni and cheese (yes definitely Graft not Kraft) when we arrived home an hour later. Deserts rounded off a magnificent experience."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! The roasted beets is a must try. Scallops was perfectly cooked.. they are not really small plates ;) we ordered six different items and we were full!  The view... awesome..."}
{"text":"I dined at Graft for the first time this past Saturday. Initially, despite putting the location into my phone's GPS I was unable to locate it and a friendly mom with a toddler in tow pointed me in the right direction. I then realized, despite being fairly familiar with downtown, I didn't initially find the restaurant because it's location is very inconspicuous. Even the signage is minimal. In the end, I found this to be an endearing part of the restaurant. The restaurant is so good it doesn't need to gloat - in the end the outstanding food and customer service will speak for itself.   Upon entering into the restaurant I immediately noticed the bright and welcoming environment. This is not a stuffy, upscale space. It is upscale don't get me wrong, but unlike other fancy restaurants in the Madison area it has a very welcoming feel to it, as though anyone despite appearances or background is welcome to enter and enjoy a drink at the bar without judgment and as part of the family. The clientele and staff is diverse and this adds to the overall positive and welcoming environment of this restaurant.  After enjoying a glass of Prosecco at the bar we were seated at nice table directly next to one of the large windows that overlooks the capitol. The seating benches are sprinkled with little pillows you can use to support your back and get cozy, which I thought was a nice added touch. While glancing out of the large window beside me at the capitol, for a moment I felt as though I was somewhere other than the city I live in, only to be reminded indeed a place with a view this incredible exists right here in Madison.  Our server, Heidi, did an incredible job making recommendations to us, she even convinced me to try the fried chevre, despite my hesitations about goat cheese. In the end we sampled what seemed like endless small plates: the brussels sprouts, roasted beets, fried chevre..all incredibly fresh tasting, bursting with flavor and light fare. Still feeling hungry after the initial samplings I was excited when the graft mac & cheese arrived because I thought the dish would be more filling and richer than all of the previous dishes - indeed it was delicious and a much welcomed sampling of comfort food on a vast menu of modern favorites - but amazingly this dish combined wonderful taste and texture without being overly heavy or filling. This impressed and left room to continue trying more food.   Next we tried the beef tartare, scallops, shrimp and grits - made with Hooks 5 year cheddar (the only suggestion I have is to please add more cheese! There is no such thing as too much Hooks cheddar), the big eye tuna, more big eye tuna (thank goodness we ordered two plates of it), the quail, the short rib, the pork belly..I had never tried pork belly and the name made me question what in the world I was about to eat but that too had a burst of flavor to it and I can now safely say I enjoy pork belly. The garganelli pasta was outstanding. It had the tastiest, creamiest, meltiest cheese on it -burrata, the creamy inside of fresh mozzarella cheese - I now have a new favorite cheese to add to my list. I wish I had discovered the existence of this cheese sooner!   The desserts were also impressive, particularly the chocolate crème served with cinnamon shortbread. I am not a chocolate lover, so I was surprised this was my favorite dessert item, but something about the creaminess and cool refreshing aftertaste made it so delicious and it was cholateley without being chocolatey (if there is such a thing). The profiteroles were fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside amazing, and the house made coffee ice cream tasted like an upgraded version of the Haagen Dasz rendition. The carrot cake was also tasty, however, my personal preference is not mixing nuts into desserts so for that reason the profiteroles and chocolate crème were my favorites.   Lucas, the owner, introduced himself to us, a very friendly person with a down to earth personality who clearly has a passion for running this restaurant and making his customers happy. The same goes for the impressive floor manager, Sarahjane, who was busy coasting throughout the restaurant with a smile making sure her customers were enjoying their dining experience and gracing them with friendly hugs and outstanding hospitality. Chef Travis also stopped by our table and took the time to explain to me the spices added to the pumpkin seeds in the brussels sprout dish.  Our server Heidi exuded positivity as well and was very attentive to our table and all others. The camaraderie of the employees is noticeable. After dining here you really leave the place feeling as though you are a part of the Graft family."}
{"text":"Graft was outstanding!  We had a group of 8 in town on business, were given a recommendation to try it, and we loved it.  Lance and his co-server (sorry can't remember her name!) were fantastic.  Very attentive, great suggestions, fun!  Graft is mainly small plates so we just ordered one of everything and shared.   The scallops (we ordered more), the curry sauce with the mussels, the fried chèvre, everything was fantastic.  Great wine list.   Great atmosphere, lively, but you can still have a conversation across the table without shouting.    Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"If available I would have given it 4.5 stars.  The food was good. There were four of us and we ordered 8 plates. The two guys were still hungry.  Favorite dishes included the fried chevre, the pheasant and the steak tartare.  The walleye was the least favorite fish.  All and all it is definitely worth a second visit.  The service was attentive and they even replaced a drink spilled.  In the future I would love for them to be able to tell about how many plates to order per person. The small plates were teeny."}
{"text":"Outstanding experience. Upscale-but-approachable restaurant. Our main waiter, Shi (sp?) was terrific and his waiter partner was always right there when we had a question. General manager spent some time talking to us and helped us pick out a bottle of wine. Beef tartare we ordered had a little intentional sear on it. We mentioned it as something we didn't absolutely love about the meal and the executive chef came out to talk to us about it to explain their rationale! Pretty neat that it was so personal. Probably our favorite restaurant in Madison."}
{"text":"Very pricey for what you get. Far too acoustically live, so the echoes are deafening. Friendly service, but like most Madison spots that hire students, the staff needs more training."}
{"text":"First time at Graft, location and facility are nice. Wait staff is still learning but trying hard, I don't have any problems with wait staff writing down the order, trying to remember is fine as long as you get it correct, they did not. Food is good, not great yet but good. Will be back to try again, hope that they keep  improving."}
{"text":"My wife and I had our anniversary dinner here - and we made the right choice! Incredibly professional and attentive staff, kept the wine flowing and the small plates coming.   The Brussels sprouts are incredible - didn't last long between my wife and I having our turns. The mac and cheese was the same story - creamy but not too rich. The beef short rib and scallops came next, and were both orgasmic. At this point, would we have enough room for our shared large plate??  Yes. The steak and polenta came and we loved it. The steak was cooked perfectly, but the real standout was the polenta. I don't what they do to it, but we couldn't get enough of it!  You won't regret a date night here. Throw on some glad rags and love it up!"}
{"text":"Graft- I'm gonna update my \"meh\" review from last time. Had dinner with a few girlfriends here last weekend and the food was flawless. We were especially impressed with the whole branzino, which came perfectly roasted and accompanied by a delicate, lovely consomme.  We also quite enjoyed the scallops. Our cocktails were topnotch too.  Have to say that the ambiance made the meal- it's nice to have a place to go on the Square that's more refined/quiet and elegant."}
{"text":"We went to their soft opening last weekend (4 courses and all the wine you can drink for free... what more could you ask for?). While they were still working through some timing issues with the kitchen, the food itself was absolutely fantastic (their unique take on a WI classic, the fried cheese curd, was out of this world), the red, wine, and sparking house wine options were on point, and the service was super friendly and knowledgeable. The owner came to our table to solicit feedback and take the time to tell us about the conception and process of opening the restaurant, despite the incredibly busy night.  We had only a couple of areas for improvement (lighting and a couple notes on some food items) but by their true opening, friends who has joined us on that night told us everything we had suggested had been implanted and perfected. They also had their cocktail menu up by that point and we took a look at their menu and they looked creative and excited, and our friends confirmed they were delicious and balanced.  I loved the very clean, modern but welcoming decor.  So excited for (FINALLY) another A+ restaurant in Madison and to become a regular at Graft."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Food was top notch with wonderful small dishes with unique flavors.  Contemporary furnishings with touch of industrial/rustic feel.  A good wine list that is reasonably priced.  Will be going back many more times."}
{"text":"What a bummer. I was so excited to go to Graft. I left feeling dissatisfied. The food was mediocre and the service was so-so. After all the hype around it, I expected something more. The dishes lacked a wow factor. Everything we had was something that could be made at home without much effort. The wait staff was hesitant, cold, and lacked knowledge of the menu. If you're looking for a good experience, I'd say skip Graft and go to Pig in a Fur Coat for a similar vibe (but much better food and service). Sadly, I won't be back."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Graft and what a fantastic experience.  From the wonderful manager who greeted us upon arrival to the waiter and other staff, everyone was very friendly and helpful, and the food divine.  We will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Not just delicious... Such a fun experience, too! I came with a girlfriend and service was great from the moment we walked in the door. I really wish I could remember our server's name - he was fantastic. We asked him about the wines and he brought us a handful to try before we made our selections. He was really spot on with describing the wines and encouraged us to taste and take our time deciding. He was the same with the food. We had the roasted beets, the potato pave, the pappardelle, and the hangar steak. The beets were good, but just beets. It's the only dish I would recommend skipping. The potato pave was awesome - really unique. It was topped with a sauteed spinach, coffee butter (YUM) and crispy capers. Our server recommended the pappardelle over the mac and cheese and I'm glad he did, it was delicious. The hanger steak was great too, served with leek bread pudding and roasted parsnips. I loved that we didn't feel rushed and that we were encouraged to take our time and enjoy. We ordered 2 dishes at a time so everything was warm when we got to it. We enjoyed ourselves so much we decided to stay for dessert.. They had us at coffee ice cream and bourbon caramel. The space is beautiful, too. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Graft may be mistaken for just \"another farm to table\" restaurant around the square. I'd argue that maybe it should be labeled as THE farm to table restaurant around the square. Graft offers consistently good food, classy atmosphere,  great service,  and refreshing cocktails, all for a reasonable price. We have visited a few times now and never have we left disappointed.  One of the ways you know a restaurant is good is when you go there on week nights and you need a reservation. We didn't learn the first few times and waited for bar seats to open, but, now we get it. When you are seated you will notice no salt or pepper on the table. That's usually a clue that a restaurant is good as the chef is implying they will make the food just right and just how it should be tasted.  We have ordered nearly all of the most recent menu and remain impressed. Some highlights include the beef tartare, oyster po' boy, mussels, and Mac and cheese. They all hit the spot and provide a combination of flavor and texture. And, as the expectation is set, it is well appropriately seasoned.  Overall, definitely one of the winners of Madison dining. Hope you enjoy!"}
{"text":"I loved the service and the food was pretty good - pork belly was fairly good though not outstanding, but the goat cheese balls were my favorate - delicately done and well balanced.  We also liked roasted beets, trout rillette and papardelle.  We will definitely go back and would recommend this place to others looking for high quality food.  I just hope they would regularly update the menu - it is rather limited and if the restaurant is heading for the same place as, say, 43 North, and keep serving the same food year after year, just like 43 North, then the establishment may have a hard time continuing to attract enough crowd to keep it going.    I accidentally left my glasses and we were walking towards our car - but one of their servers caught up with us just to get the glasses to me - he was out of breath after runnig for 4 blocks...  Now that's good service."}
{"text":"Superb!! The food, the drinks, the ambiance, and the staff were all top notch! The chef visited our table regularly to deliver our food and our server was attentive but didn't hover.   We tried the fried chevre, the steak tartare, the mac and cheese, the papardelle, the roasted beets, the scallops, the meatballs, and the pork belly. We also had all of the desserts: profiteroles, lemon tart with meringue, and chocolate pots de creme. Everything was exceptional, but my favorites were the scallops, the pork belly, and the fried chevre!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there before a 7:30 concert on a Tuesday night.  We were very early so selected one of the choice spots by the window overlooking the Capitol.  Attractive sleek looking, minimalist decor that seems to be everywhere these days.  Friendly and attentive staff.  We had 3 small plates between the 2 of us, and that was plenty along with the bread plate, which was an extra $3--we thought that odd.  Loved all of the food we ordered. We had the barbecued chicken tacos, the scallops and the shrimp.  Next time I'll try a dessert.  We were definitely happy with everything and will return for sure!  I'd give it 4 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"My experience Saturday night at Graft was amazing.  My boyfriend and i came here for an early Valentine's Day dinner. We shared a bottle of Chappellet Mountain Cuvee 2014 (they have an extensive wine list pricing on average $50+) and 7 small plate dishes. Their pricing, i thought was very fair with an average of $5-$15 per plate. Their menu is divided into sections; Veg & Grains, Fish & Shellfish, Meat, Large Plates and Sweets.   What we tried from each small plate section...  Veg & Grains -- Roasted Beets: Enjoyed this dish. The ricotta cheese and almost candied sunflower seeds are a really tasty touch. Not a super huge fan of beets, but this was different and it was great. Graft Mac & Cheese: A must have! Might be my favorite of the night.   Fish & Shellfish -- Scallops: These were prepared perfectly and tasted as expected. Big Eye Tuna: This was possibly my boyfriends favorite dish. The dish is cold, and served on a bed of shaved apples, which i thought was unique.   Meat -- Quail: The amount of meat on the tiny bird is minimal but flavorful. The bed of farro was delicious (we scraped the plate). Pork Belly: The meat was super savory. Perhaps, my second favorite dish? I would say the asparagus that came with this dish, was not the best i have ever had. The pork made up for it though.   Sweets -- Profiteroles: This was to die for. If you like coffee, don't even look at the other items on the menu. I am still dreaming about this dessert option.   I would like to note that the timing for the meal was not exactly what i was expecting. The dishes did come out as they were prepared...But, the first two dishes that came out were both the cold, roasted beets and big eye tuna. We did not get a chance to finish the beets before the tuna had arrived. After that, there was a quite some long gap between that and the mac & cheese. There also was some overlap with some of the other hot dishes, which took away from some of our bites, as more food was put on the table. Overall, a great meal...we will be back!  We also, stayed at the bar after our meal for a few drinks. The bar manager and a team member (with a beard and glasses), were so friendly and had good chats with us!  They made the night even more special and interesting for us. So shout out to them! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Graft is amazing. Food is creative and delicious. The wine list is extensive with varietals you don't see everywhere. The atmosphere is fun and the service is as good as it gets in Madison."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best places on the square. From a menu of crafty cocktails to a delectable assortment of dishes - You can't go wrong with Graft.   My favorite dish has the the pork belly which melts like butter in your mouth followed by the Brussel sprouts.   The restaurant is a triple threat - great cocktails, food and ambiance. Highly recommend and the service is amazing as always!"}
{"text":"Great spot in Madison for a true dining experience. We went in with high expectations and the chef and staff did not disappoint!  We allowed our service team to put together a menu with paired wine and cocktails that was 100% on point. We enjoyed every dish and pairing.   We were also impressed that both the Chef and management were invested in ensuring out meal was perfect. We highly recommend Graft for dining pleasure.   Go! and let the staff choose and prepare  you a fabulous dining experience."}
{"text":"There are just two Madison restaurants where the food is always excellent and the service always impeccable; Graft is one of them (and Dan Fox's Heritage Tavern is the other). Lucas Henning, the owner, and the excellent managers, have left nothing to chance. The menu is exquisite, but describing it will only give you a fleeting glimpse since it changes over time. When an amazing sea bass was taken off the menu I was appalled--until I tasted the salmon with lentils and beets that replaced it; one of the best salmon dishes I've ever had anywhere. When the salmon was gone I was upset once again, until I tried the branzino that took its place. I learned not to second-guess what's on the menu and just order it anyway; I've never been disappointed. The graft mac and cheese is rich and decadent, the fried chevre with honey is delicate and full of flavor, the pork belly exceptional, the spare rib will leave you wanting more; even the bread is delicious.  The fact that most of the menu items are small plates means you can try a lot of them, and share the joy of excellent cuisine with your friends. If you don't save room for dessert you will miss out on a pot de creme or perhaps a banana bread pudding (tragically, what was nothing short of the world's best carrot cake was rotated off the menu, and if enough of us complain about that it may just return!)  The elegant atmosphere and the central location (right on Capitol Square) complement the overall experience.  The service is very attentive as well, thanks to the hands-on owner and managers, and the great staff (both in and out of the kitchen).  Graft is worth a try, and if you go once, you'll be back again with friends in tow.  What a terrific experience!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend is a chef in Madison and everywhere we go to eat, he's seeing someone he knows. Sometimes this is not that fun (people aren't always nice!), but last night at Graft it was awesome. Their chef, Phillip, came out and talked us through all the plates we were eating. We may or may not have gone two rounds on some brussels sprouts, and really loved the pork belly and the roasted snapper. Chicken thigh was good too. Mushroom ravioli (3 the size of 50 cent pieces) was overpriced and average at $12, but the rest of our dinner was great.  Cocktails are lovely, but they're not worth $11 ($9 would be a more reasonable price). Wines by the glass list was awesome. Service from Oceana was stellar. Interiors are gorgeous.  They may need to tweak pricing as service continues, but this is a place I want to keep hanging out. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in, crashed at the bar and enjoy a Founders Porter, the beef tartar and the Apple salad and they were all exactly as the bartender described. Amazing!  Highly recommend!  The manager, a lady at the front door was very nice and checked on me at the bar which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"We dined last night. We shared the Brussels Sprouts,scallops,and short rib. All three were excellent choices.Our only complaint was the short pours of wine. Cool decor and our service was fantastic."}
{"text":"The food was solid. Definitely worth a try if you're looking for a small/shared plates type of dining. I keep my review at 3 stars because the price point is pretty high and you don't leave full. I and a friend (both reasonably nutrition and portion-conscious) grabbed a slice of Ian's afterward.   Good food. Good service. Cool atmosphere. Gut says I can't go above 3 star since the fact remains you might think they made a mistake when the bill comes."}
{"text":"When someone recommended GRAFT to me, I had an instinctual reaction: \"What kind of restaurant names itself after a word with such negative connotations?!\" From dictionary.com: \"The acquisition of money, gain, or advantage by dishonest, unfair, or illegal means, especially through the abuse of one's position or influence in politics, business, etc.\" I'm a Tammany Hall junky, though, and I forgot about all the other meanings of GRAFT.  But maybe that gut reaction towards GRAFT was a premonition because this place was not good. The tuna tartare lacked any of the 'bang' you get when it's really well-done -- either a nice avocado layer underneath or spice and tang -- and the roast beets were bland. The most unpardonable, though, was the Mac and Cheese, which my dining partner characterized as \"worse than something out of a box.\" It was entirely flavorless and the \"crumbs\" were just .25 square inch toast cubes. (You thought it was fine grained layer of crumbs?! You thought wrong!) At this point, we were at GRAFT and felt like victims of GRAFT! Got the check and went out. To GRAFT's credit, they comped us the mac and cheese after we told them why we didn't like it. This is definitely not our being overly critical. If you think I don't love great Mac & Cheese, check out my reviews of Rocco's and Almond.   Last thing: the bathroom sink faucet is absurd. You had to position your hand perfectly in front of the infrared beams and hold it there to get the water going, and if you put both your hands there, the stream had a high chance of stopping. It took like 3 minutes to thoroughly wash my hands. Not exactly the kind of setup you want for finger food.  Decor is in the \"hotel bar/restaurant\" style."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant with a great location right on Capitol square. We were seated quickly on a Friday night!  The decor and vibe is very modern. Everything from the reclaimed wood walls, to the pendant lighting above the bar, to the wallpapered bathrooms really just works. I could take some notes from this place on how to decorate my own home!   Our server was really helpful and outgoing.   Wine list is quite extensive with the cheapest bottles being in the upper $30 range. None of the cocktails really caught my eye so the Bf and I stuck with wine.   We ordered three dishes. This was in no way enough food for the two of us, but we were planning on filling ourselves up on beer and eventually Ian's pizza (just reliving my college days...) later in the night,   We ordered the tuna tartare, which was really refreshing. It was served with rice chips, which didn't add any flavor, but added to the texture! The Pork Belly was mmmm mmm good. No complaints so far. We finished off our meal with the Papardelle, which was creamy and flavorful, but was served a bit too room temperature for my liking,   As a whole, we loved all of our food. Were we full after our meals? No. Was it pricey? Yes.  But even with these facts taken into account, I enjoyed the atmosphere, food and service enough to recommend it."}
{"text":"I recently visited for the second time with friends. The first time was when they had just opened, and probably hadn't found their rhythm yet. I wasn't planning on returning until my friends convinced me to try it again. My second experience was much better. My friend had made a reservation so we were seated right on time. We ordered drinks (I had wine, so nothing special to review there) and then ordered a number of items to share.   - We started with the bread and the fried chevre, and spread the chevre on the pieces of bread - The broccolini has a delicious caesar sauce on the top - The mac and cheese was yummy, I liked the croutons that gave it a little crunch. This was a large serving size for an $8 shareable - Short rib was flavorful and pulled apart easily - Ended with a pot de creme that had a great butterscotch flavor (and I do not normally like butterscotch)  Overall my experience was much better this time, from the service and the actual food, and I would definitely return with a larger group to share new items I haven't tried."}
{"text":"Attentive service. Creative cocktails. And excellent dishes. Graft is great experience."}
{"text":"I haven't enjoyed a dinner out in a very long time, until my experience at Graft last night. From the service to the wine list to the delicious variance of food, it was a true treat dining at Graft.   Their pasta is house made and is a STAND OUT. Some of the best \"butter noodles\" I've had. Additionally, all of the meat products were stellar, particularly the bone-in ribeye. Wish I could celebrate every monumental occasion here."}
{"text":"The staff fended off one-star review last moment.   I agree with the reviewers that there is not nearly enough vegetable-focused dishes. We ordered 6 plates and while Mixed Greens, Bread plate, and Papardelle were on point after that we waited and waited and waited for the other 3 dishes. Finally after a lot of nagging the waiter, shrimp and grits showed up. Shrimp was overcooked and bland, grits were ok with cheddar cheese mixed in haphazardly. Then finally 2 beef dishes showed up and that's when shit hit the fan. By that time we had been at the table for 1.5 hours and frankly I lost all the appetite already. My brain came to conclusion that the meal was over. But back to those 2 awful dishes. The hangar steak that by the way the waiter had never asked us how to cook, was rare. Parsnips were hard to bite, undercooked as well. Beef cheeks were....I don't even know what the hell that was. Instead of tender flaky a bit gelatinous cheek cut it was some kind of chewy like a leather piece of beef. Cutting through it let alone chew through it was virtually impossible. I refuse to believe it was the stated cut.   I was just about to write a one-star review when someone looking like a manager finally came over and apologized and took both dishes that we barely touched off our bill. Then someone who I assume was a chef came over and also apologized and said they had been going through 7 iterations testing with shrimp grits. Why on Earth would you do such testing on the customers?  May lose them before you get to the end of testing.  The meal ended with free dessert that the waiter said \"takes seconds to prepare\". Thanks for not even pretending that it was made fresh. All in all a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I can not rave enough about this place. A friend and I attended a dinner service the week that Graft openeed; the staff was knowledgeable and very attentive, the portions are small, but the very point of small plates is to share with others and to try a variety of menu items. We ordered the pork belly, spatzle macaroni and cheese, and artichoke - followed with a creme catalina.  There is not a single item that did not \"wow\" us.  The wine selection is exceptional as well.   The atmosphere is simple with a flare for the lavish; not crowded with decorations, but the colors are inviting and the set up is creative. The bar is beautiful and booths a bit private.  We were approached by one of the owners who was very interested in our opinions of the food and ambiance; which is nice to see from any restaurant.   We left feeling extremely welcome and appreciated. I will definitely be going back, and taking new people with me each time."}
{"text":"I am giving this rating based solely on the meal. I strongly believe that in terms of service, Graft has a stellar staff. Everyone we interacted with was warm, friendly, and attentive.  We ended up going there at 6:15 PM because we had a show at 8PM at the Overture. We thought that this would be plenty of time for us to dine and still make it to the show on time. We unfortunately ended up having to quickly leave at 7:55 (without even getting to attempt dessert) because of some small mishaps in our meal. My husband and I ordered 5 small plates: Mac & Cheese, Pappardelle, Hanger Steak, Pork Belly, and Tuna Tartare. This this is more a review on the food, I am going to go through each plate individually.  When we asked our waiter about how the courses should be served, he said that he would take care of lining them up to provide the best pairings. This was how the meal came out: 1.) Mac & Cheese and Tuna Tartare 2.) Pappardelle 3.) Pork Belly & Hanger Steak  I think in the end, there were some major issues in the kitchen that night because I don't think this was how the plates were originally suppose to be served. My biggest issue with the pairing was the Mac & Cheese with Tuna Tartare. I feel like it is a fundamental faux pas to serve cheese and fish. I didn't enjoy the combination of a fatty fish like tuna with a heavy cheese and buttermilk that was in the mac.  Mac & Cheese: The biggest issue here was the macaroni was overcooked and the dish was incredibly mushy. Also, there was not a large enough textural difference. They added some croutons on the top, but there weren't enough to counter the overall mushiness of the dish. In terms of the flavor, I think it was really one-note. Perhaps if the mac was topped with a very different cheese like parmesan or something with a sharp bite, that could have helped. But the cheese sauce was made with buttermilk so the dish has a underlying sourness to it. Overall, I was not very impressed with this dish and I think that other places in Madison do better Mac & Cheese.  Tuna Tartare: I really enjoyed the freshness of the tuna and generally thought this was nice. The only unfortunate parts were the apparent lack of acidity and salt. The tartare was served with rice chips. I think the rice chips, while very unique, are not practical. The chips easily got stuck in your teeth and turned glue-like. That being said, the initial crunch of the rice chips and the saltiness of it is really awesome, I just didn't like how I was constantly trying to pick the chips out of my teeth for the rest of the meal.  Pappardelle: I am going to be honest, this was a train-wreck but I think this may just be a fluke. I was really excited about trying this dish because I saw some really promising reviews about it. When the dish came out, there was a very large hair on top. Hey this happens, I am not here to pass judgement on the what I would considered to be a random accident. I immediately informed the host and waiter and I could tell they were very embarrassed. They took the plate and ordered a new one completely (and I didn't realize until later that they actually didn't charge us for this dish! Plus they gave us a complimentary dish while we waited). When the dish finally came out, the pappardelle was...gummy. The pasta was a semolina-based noodle but I think there was either too much water or egg in the dough. We took a bite each, and had to push the dish aside because it was not very good. The mushrooms on it were very nice though. But going back to the sauce, I have the same comment as I did about the Mac & Cheese: it was one-note.  Pork-Belly: The pork belly was pretty nice. The sauce was salty and acidic enough to counterbalance the fattiness of the belly. The meat could have been more tender to my taste but my husband appreciated that it had some chew. We both agreed that the skin could have had more crunch and there was definitely a lack of sauce on the plate in proportion to the thickness of the pork. They served this with purple potatoes but there was nothing really special about that potatoes.   Sweet Potato Pave (complimentary dish): This was the dish we were provided for free after the mishap with the pappardelle. It was a simple and rustic dish of layered sweet and regular potato. This was served with a side of spinach and caper. I think my husband and I enjoyed the greens more than the potato at this point in the meal just because we are starting to become full. Overall though, it was an okay dish and a very nice sentiment.     Hanger Steak: We asked for medium-rare minus and we got medium-rare minus! The steak was very good and I really enjoyed the parsnip fries it was served with. I really liked the leek bread pudding but was so filled that I couldn't really eat much of it. The mornay sauce was nice as well but by this time in the meal, it was just too rich for us. If I were to recommended one dish, I would recommend this one.  Overall:The staff was great but the food was meh."}
{"text":"For a $$$ restaurant, the food lacked complexity, and the presentation was simple. The food was more appetizing on the menu than it was on the tongue. Service was friendly and attentive. Well designed interior, and quiet atmosphere. Craft cocktails were good, but there are better in town. I would go again only if friends insisted."}
{"text":"This was in 2016, but when my boyfriend and I walked in, most of the tables in the place were unoccupied. We were told by the snobby hostess that we would have to wait for a table, because they had had several good reviews in magazines recently and were very popular.  We waited maybe 5 minutes until we were seated.  The portions were ridiculously small, food was nothing to remember.  Despite the recent rave reviews, I will never be back because of the way we were treated by the hostess when they were just starting out."}
{"text":"Took my mom, son & DiL for a special Christmas dinner, and these guys didn't disappoint. Not only was the food interesting and tasty, but the staff joined in our festivities and kept the laughter flowing. The ceviche, pork belly, and jasmine rice were our favs!"}
{"text":"Awesome place near Overture Theater. Scott, the bartender, is fantastic. The Brussels sprouts are amazing. Try the basaltic cocktail. Great!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the ambiance and was excited to check this place out based on the multitude of good reviews I read. However, despite having a reservation (on a Friday night), we waited almost 15 minutes for our table beyond our reservation time. The service was a little slow and while our waiter was very nice, he seemed a little flustered running between tables. We tried a number of the starters and small plates, which were well presented and tasty. But the large plates (some upwards of $40!) really left something to be desired. Specifically the halibut was just a piece of fish with a little sauce on a big plate. That's it. Really nothing special, and definitely not worth $42!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at Graft.  The service was very friendly.  We had good conversation with multiple staff, and they were able to tell us about the dishes and make good suggestions.  We had six dishes and all were excellent."}
{"text":"Pretty much what everyone has said is accurate. Good is great. Great cocktails.  Service and servers are good. We had the fried chèvre. Perfect. Max and cheese was great, and not smoky. Brussel sprouts were very good. Salad, and bread plate also were excellent. Ravioli with mushrooms were outstanding.   Price points were good, portions small, and hopefully they will opt for a small and large plate option to appeal to more appetites.   The ambiance is pretty incredible, with differing areas/feels to please everyone.   Great new addition to the mad town scene. Welcome Lucas and Staff. Hope you do well!!!"}
{"text":"We had pork belly, macaroni and cheese, scallops and hangar steak. All perfect. Definitely would go back. The service was great. Wonderful place. A bit loud but otherwise great. The attention to detailed service was perfect."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars, I would! What an absolutely delightful evening my companion and I had there a few nights ago.  The food was perfection as was the staff. This is a true hidden gem in Madison and I hope they stay around for a long, long time. I will be highly recommending this place to others and I can't wait until I get back there again.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Back a second time at Graft before the end of the year! Met Sam, the other owner. Very nice people.   Tried a bunch of new dishes including the parpardelle, flank steak and half chicken. All very good! Since they do change their menu, no guarantee that the parpardelle will be there. The owners gave us a complimentary dish to try. Something new they may add for 2016.  Put graft on your list of restaurants to try in 2016! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Brussels sprouts.  Quail.  Mac n cheese. If you haven't been there and enjoyed these dishes, you're missing out.  We ordered several other dishes but these certainly stood out.  Service was more than friendly but we had two guys checking in on our table which made our orders for food and drink seem a bit confusing.  Felt as though we were directing traffic with the two but in the end, only one entree didn't make it to the table.  Overall, would I go back?  Definitely!!  We all enjoyed every plate ordered."}
{"text":"Well. They would have to either fix their portions or their price. I am sure it had been said:   Too expensive for mediocre food.  They have a good selections of dishes, from veggies to grains, seafood, poultry and meat... However, the portions are tiny and the flavors and styling aren't worth the price they charge.  You are basically paying for their \"ambience\" and \"style\", not the food.  We ordered 6 dishes to share and neither one of us is full.   They do have a good selections of wine and cocktails.  However, I would only come back for perhaps lights snacks and a drink or two, not an actual dinner. There are way better options in Madison for the price you will be paying for...."}
{"text":"Scott is THE MOST excellent bartender and liqueur connoisseur. Please at least stop by to enjoy Scott's talents and skills at Graft! He makes excellent recommendations to pair with desserts. He is by far the best in his field- and we have loved and visited places all over the country and world. Keep up the superb job, Scott!"}
{"text":"This is my most favorite restaurant in Madison. They have a variety of plates and switch out menu items every now and then so you can try new things. Most of the plates are smaller so you generally order 2-3 per person and share.   The mac and cheese is the best I've ever had, it's so creamy and delicious. A new menu item they have that is fantastic is the short rib  - it's so incredibly tender and tasty. The bread service is a must as well - they have a garlic monkey bread, some kind of baguette or french bread and an herb butter.   They have an extensive wine and beer list as well. I tend to stick to their specialty cocktails and have always been impressed. Wait staff is always super friendly and helpful. I've been here a handful of times and the host always remembers us."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday night, hoping to find a table as most places on State Street were full. We were seated immediately in the window with a great view of the Capitol. First impression, the interior of the restaurant is beautiful.  Our server left much to be desired. Quiet, no personality, didn't explain anything or offer suggestions. Was there to take our orders and once to check on our meal. We wondered if this was just the vibe of the place but heard/ saw the waiter behind us excited to be at his job.  We ordered the Brussel sprouts: (my favorite!!) delicious flavor but an unnecessary add of cilantro. Mac and cheese: kind of blah and lacking a good cheese flavor. The Bread with honey butter was great. Flank Steak was tough and lacking any real flavor, we did not enjoy it nor finish it.  I had hoped we would receive a decent amount of food but we both felt the portions, quality, and pricing did not match up. Way too little food. $9 dollars for Brussel sprouts? You can get 3x the Brussel sprouts with Nueskes bacon for cheaper across the street at Rare.  The dessert was amazing. We had the pumpkin doughnuts with coffee ice cream and caramel. I'm a sucker for coffee ice cream though.  An enjoyable experience, but portions are a bit small and our server needed to go home and take a nap."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Madison.  Food was full of flavor, cooked perfectly, and presented beautifully. It doesn't get any better than this. Top it off the service is impeccable and ambiance is outstanding. Well done. Bravo."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried Graft out with a glass of wine and a small plate.  The experience was underwhelming.  Graft's interior is sleek and sophisticated but when half full the noise is overly robust.  The by the glass wine list offers decent choices at several price points.  The smoked trout rilletes at $14 was very small and pricey for what it was--a few bites of pate in a very small mason jar and six thin, miniature crostini.  Three of the \"larger\" crostini had large holes leaving the diner to balance a bit of the trout pate on the edge of the crostini, with some falling through the holes.  Getting the trout on to the  crostini was actually comical!  Service was a bit cloying and excessive given that we clearly stated we were there for a glass of wine and a tidbit.  Nice setting but not impressed with the small sample of food we tried."}
{"text":"Wow, great experience at Graft! Very pleasant atmosphere, friendly and professional waitstaff and a terrific menu. Limited selection of dishes, but everything we had was perfect (fried chèvre, chicken terrine, pork belly, tagliatelle and branzino). The bread plate wasn't remarkable, but it was a good pairing with the fried chèvre. Tasty, unique cocktails and an extensive wine list with something at every price point. Prices and portions were perfect--you won't leave feeling like you overpaid for an undersized meal. If you order 2-3 plates per person, you'll leave perfectly satisfied. I'll definitely be back to try out a few more of the options I didn't try on my first visit!"}
{"text":"Exquisite WINE bar on the capitol square in Madison.  HOSPITALITY is the name of the game here as the small dishes are tasty and ever changing so put this down as a place to visit!"}
{"text":"Great service and food. Our only complaint was the seating is so close together we felt like we were seated at the reject table at a wedding reception. Tables are crammed together so tightly that you cannot get in or out without moving them. Servers were bumping into guests while they were trying to to pour our water. Made for an uncomfortable meal."}
{"text":"Graft is my absolute favorite place in Madison. Literally the best service I've ever seen. The bartender I had the first time I went there remembered my favorite drink off the top of his head when I came back and made it for me on the house without me even asking. I really feel at home here."}
{"text":"Hostess was fantastic! Interesting menu. Vegetarian items were especially well prepared. Good selection of wines by the glass. Servers were friendly and helpful. I love short ribs but this was stringy like my mother's pot roast from the 70's! Horseradish accompaniment was fantastic. Branzino was mediocre. Doubtful that we will return."}
{"text":"This place raises the bar! Love the concept, ambience, service and the food is amazing! Definitely impressed just moving from Minneapolis where the food scene is insane."}
{"text":"Hands down my fav restaurant in Madison. Every dish we had was amazing! Scott at the bar was friendly and knowledgeable about drinks. He told us of their policy that if we order a drink and don't like it there's no charge therefore no risk in trying something. The food: mussels, Brussel sprouts, mac n cheese, tuna, bread plate, pork - all fabulous! I would order the same things again. We got 4 drinks w our dinner and the cost was $100. Christopher the manager was so talkative and told us about the history behind Graft. Be sure to check out their bathrooms! No joke. They are pretty special. And there's a private wine room."}
{"text":"We went to Graft on a Friday night with an 8 o'clock reservation. The place seemed fairly full.   Ambiance:  -The interiors were great. This might be odd but I love beautiful restrooms and their restroom is 5 stars. A restaurant that pays attention to its restroom is going to pay attention to other things as well... in my opinion.  -Service was great too. My water was refilled over and over. I said we weren't happy with the meal so our waiter took the pasta off the bill. I'd give them a 3.5 since they had good service.   Dinner:  -House made pasta with shrimp, peas, and butter sauce. This was very salty and pretty bad. My friend and I said it seemed like defrosted costco shrimp and vegetables with butter over pasta. Texture of pasta was good but the dish was bad.   -The tuna poke dish was in a japanese aioli over sesame oil apple slaw. Unfortunately the tuna just tasted like mayo.   -The roasted brussel sprouts were really good. We wished they had been crispy on the outside instead of sort of wet and soft all around.   -My friend got the pork belly which he said was great.   I wouldn't return.   **TIP - They don't update their menu on their website which is why I don't know the exact names of any of these dishes. Don't expect to get what's on their website. You'll just have to go there and see what they're serving."}
{"text":"Graft is amazing. Their food is fabulous, the small plates are awesome because you get to share lots of different flavors with your group! The Shrimp and grits, pork belly and the sirloin are amazing. Their Mac is also very good. Service was wonderful as well! The manager, owners and waitress were all very talkative and came over to our table to see how we were doing. Dress is business casual-ish, a collared shirt and nicer jeans or khaki's would be appropriate."}
{"text":"The cosmopolitan interior that houses a soft but sophisticated candlelight glow is what originally drew my attention to the spot as I was exploring downtown Madison.  I was most impressed by Scott who tended the bar.  His knowledge in wines and liqueurs was beyond anything that could regurgitated from memory or dictated by management.  Instead a true and undeniable passion for spirtis as well as food shown very strongly through him.   Again, his vernacular for describing the food was beyond impressive and showed genuine understanding of flavor, texture, and the concept of what the chef intended to do.  He sold the menu in an intriguing and captivating way and the food really did deliver.  Beef tartar was the only disappointing dish as it was a bit too chewy but everything else truly worth the hype.  Even the bread blew my mind and I am someone who abstains from carbs....butt....this bread was worth it!  The parpadelle is the dish to try.  Skinny girl version of a fantastically flavored and savory dish.  Great review from some someone who is hard to please:)"}
{"text":"The food was good. The beef tartare was my favorite, it was very flavorful and moist.  The scallops were good as well, cooked perfectly. The walleye was OK--it was a little dry and under seasoned. I really wanted to like the savory granola that came under the fish, it was creative, but it took away from the fish. Perhaps this dish would be better suited for fall. The mac'n cheese was very good, however.   The dessert was underwhelming--we ordered a s'mores themed dessert, it was a little dry and bland.  The cocktails were meh--they lacked complexity and personality.  Service was very good--efficient, attentive and always available.  So, overall, dishes and service were good. Cocktails and desserts were not great.   I decided on 3 stars because the restaurant is lacking a little soul. The whole thing feels a little forced, the decor is a little too perfect, if that makes sense. I like the small plates, but you struggle to pull a theme out of the menu--they say they're inspired by the Midwest, but they serve scallops with grapefruit (delicious, but just odd). The  servers' weird, orange, industrial apron straps (why?) seem like an attempt to be edgy, but they just look a little sad.    Good, but I'm not sure I'll be craving Graft."}
{"text":"This place is a little hidden on the square, but for sure worth a stop by. white table cloths and top of the line servers. It's tapas based galore and you'll definitely need a couple of entrees to fill you up, but from what I heard you should just come for a snack an some cocktails. Here's what is a must try.   - Brussel Sprouts -- YUM. I'm a fan of anything and everything brussels but these were savory deliciousness with a nice crunch with the pumpkin seeds  - Pork Belly- pair it with the brussels and you've got a meal! It was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Granted it does have a lot of fat on it.   - Fried Chevre- come on, who doesn't like fried cheese and even more so, fancy fried cheese. say yes please.   - NY Strip \"filet\" i say if you're craving steak, get it, but it's not the absolute best steak ever. Though really good still  -whatever the chef special is- it was tacos for my night and i love tacos. so they couldn't have really gone wrong, except these were the american take on a chili dog so it was a fun twist on it.   - mac and cheese- come on. again it's wisconsin, but with the gouda mixed in here it was a real delight.   While i enjoyed all the food here and the rotating menu, it is a bit pricey. with that being said, it's a again a good date night pre dinner spot or classy night with some friends.   happy eating!"}
{"text":"So amazingly good.  My husband is a very big eater, so we got 7 plates for the 2 of us, each was better than the last.  The only problem was that two drinks and 7 plates later, not to mention a fairly hefty bill, my husband was still hungry and wanted to stop for a burger!  So, if you have a big burly hungry man, maybe not the place, but some of the best food I have had in Madison."}
{"text":"This was a lovely place for a couple of drinks and small plates/tapas type of meal. The small plate prices are reasonable, probably the $$ range. The place has a really nice, bright decor.   My favorite plates were the breads, the brussel sprouts, the chicken slider, and the short ribs. We also ordered the Mac and Cheese and the beef tartar. These dishes were okay. The beef did not have a lot of flavor and I guess I'm just not a fancy mac and cheese kinda guy. The cocktails were delicious. They're also deceptively strong. The gelato dessert was so good. If you are just looking to get small plates, we had 5+bread between 2 people and were totally stuffed afterwards.  The service was excellent. There were multiple staff members that were attending to our table but we never felt like we were being suffocated with attention or anything like that."}
{"text":"Great venue for dinner.  I had the apple salad and the quail. My dining companion had the Brussels sprouts and the scallops.  We were both really happy with our meals.  Great service.  Nice ambiance.  We didn't have a reservation, but they were able to squeeze us in.  Love the food scene in Madision, and Graft contributes to the fantastic array of good restaurants."}
{"text":"Had a great date night at Graft.  Not much if anything can I say was wrong with this place.  Atmosphere was comfortable and relaxing.   Enjoyed a both by the kitchen which was a prime spot, the only negative is that it did get loud as got later in the evening.   Service was friendly, knowledgeable and made you fell at home and never rushed.  We started with the brussel sprouts and mac and cheese both highly recommend and would get again.  Next up was the pork belly and scallops.  Don't come here and not get either of these they are amazing.   Had the profiteroles which was good although next time will check out some of the other sweets.  Beer selection was ok but most come for the wine list.   If you enjoy eating locally sourced, and like small plate offering to allow you to try multiple menu items this place is a must.  Overall left feeling very satisfied at a price point that matched the experience."}
{"text":"We had a small gathering at Graft - about 30 people. And it was fantastic! The food was beyond reproach, the waitstaff was friendly and welcoming, the atmosphere was beautiful and warm, and the cocktails were delightful.  Graft's menu is such where there is something that appeals to every palette, and the chef goes through great lengths to ensure those with dietary restrictions don't feel excluded from the dining experience. It made for a beautiful event and evening. I'd recommend Graft without hesitation."}
{"text":"Exceptional service. Food tasted great. I'll go here for dinner next time I'm in Madison"}
{"text":"An outstanding place on the main square in Mad town! I had ducked in here with a few colleagues for a quick drink and bite, and was greeted with slightly eclectic decor (hip modern seating at the bar, and drapes and stuff on one side!), an outstanding bartender resulting a great cocktails and indulging in a fabulous steak tartar which boasted perfectly diced cubes of flank steak (very unusual, but a great choice) perfectly seasoned and dressed, quail egg and croutons.  This made for a deliciously meaty, herby and crunchy bite well washed down with my Martinez.  Subsequent visits have led to the discovery of a perfectly cooked snapper in a chili glaze with sweet roasted carrots, a combination which has to be eaten to be  believed.  Other great apps where the lemony grits beautifully balanced with earthy kale, mac and cheese was a perfect blend of tender tangy spaetzle enveloped in a velvety cheese sauce, chicken thighs were a perfect combination of crispy skin and a very toothsome bit of dark meat and a harissa that added a flavor contrast to the meat and made your mouth want more.  The only thing which was not perfection in itself may have been the trout rilletes which were a tad dry and could have used a quail egg or something equally fatty and velvety on top (maybe an Uni butter sauce!??).  Outstanding service and a very good wine list (slightly high on the markup methinks) compliment the menu.  The experiences add a pleasant conotation to the word graft!"}
{"text":"Everything about Graft is amazing--decor, service, food, wine list...We love that we don't have to order everything all at once. We can order some plates then evaluate what's next. The combination of flavor sand the use of seasonal ingredients puts Graft at the top of our list!"}
{"text":"We went for a friends birthday and had a great time, minus them forgetting I told them it was a friends birthday and us awkwardly reminding them at the end. Mac and cheese is on point. We each got 1 order for ourselves"}
{"text":"The food was great. The portions are small. The prices are medium. The wine list is extensive. The atmosphere is outstanding."}
{"text":"Impeccable experience. Professionals in every regard. Incredibly well priced and expansive wine menu to boot!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Graft and we were pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant itself has very simple and tasteful decor and a great layout.  The menu consists of small plates (to be shared) and we thought that we would be needing a second dinner afterwards but we were very stuffed by the time we left!    We shared the fried chèvre, the bread platter (comes with delicious honey butter), pork belly (with delicious mustard asparagus), scallops (wish these tasted a little more truffle-y), and the NY steak.  Everything was delicious...the only thing we probably would have skipped were the fried chèvre.  It was too rich for our liking.  We also shared a carrot cake and profiteroles for dessert.  We were impressed by the amazing service and how quickly everything came out.  We will definitely be frequenting this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This restaurant & cocktail bar is amazing! The Profligate cocktail is my absolute favorite cocktail in all of Madison.   Thee food is delicious too! I've tried practically the whole menu in the many, many visits I've had and never had anything I didn't like.   The service is wonderful and treat you like family- so friendly.   Would recommend this to anyone who is in the area. It's an absolutely beautiful space and location with a view of the capital right in front of you!"}
{"text":"This place was so good! We came here pretty hungry, so I wasn't sure how it would be with the small plates. They were pretty small - between three of us, we ordered a bunch of dishes. Unfortunately, I'm pretty self conscious taking pictures of food when it's not just me and my husband ...I should probably own it next time, but for now, no pictures :(.   Mac n cheese - SO good and unique with the spaetzle. Super cheesy and loved the croutons on top  Beef tartare - it was okay. I was starving, so at the time, it was delish. But looking back, it felt a little more chewy than normal. Croutons on top of these, too, which were a great crunch addition. It kind of felt like the meat was cooked a little bit, but the flavor was on point.   Jasmine rice salad - I was unsure about this one because I thought it was just be rice. It was actually very good. Super refreshing dish and packed with flavor. I loved the different veggies and sauce the rice had.   Oyster Po boy - it was good! I'm not a big oyster fan, but they were fried to perfection, so they had minimal flavor but nice fried-goodness. The coseslaw on it was good, too, and it came with hot sauce on the side.   Short rib - This was a fantastic dish! The meat was so tender and had great flavor. A bit of warning - I took a big bite of what I thought was mashed potatoes on top of the meat. DO NOT DO THIS. It was horseradish and it packed a punch.   Fried chevre (pronounced shev) - my favorite dish. 3 little fried goat cheese balls. Lightly fried and the cheese literally melted in your mouth. SO good! If you like goat cheese, you must get this!!  We were still hungry and then ordered more. We then got the Brussel sprouts and mussels. Honestly, everything was so good up until this point and every dish exceeded my expectations. But with these two, they were my least favorite. The brussel sprouts had a flavor in it that I didn't like, horseradish maybe? And they weren't evenly cooked. Some felt more cooked than others, which I would've rather had them all feel pretty cooked. For the mussels, they were pretty spicy. We got the bread to go with this.  The bread - annoyed with this. I saw people get the bread and they had two options . However, we had one type and it was super crunchy and tasted like big slices of croutons. Not my favorite.   Dessert was the pot de creme. It was really good - tasted like pudding!"}
{"text":"If you love tapa style sharing and a full menu that dives into dozens of cultural cuisines, then graft is a spot you need to check out. It's a tad pricey for what you get, but the flavors are well worth the date."}
{"text":"Amazing service for a special birthday dinner. Everything was top-notch from start to finish. Our waiter had great insight into what to order on the menu based on our preferences. Couldn't have asked for more!"}
{"text":"Food was really fantastic. Yellowfin tuna, Brussels sprouts, scallops, halibut, ny strip, pork belly, short ribs, cake. They were all really good.  Drinks were problematic. Cocktails came out late several plates in. We were planning on having a bottle of wine but we were almost done with our dinner. Wine by the glass pours were a bit stingy.  Otherwise service was solid. Nice decor but a little loud."}
{"text":"I love this place. It has never let me down. Excellent food, service, location, ambiance. Intimate for close friends or special romantic dinners, upscale enough to take out of towners to.   At this point, I have sampled everything on the menu and cannot find a loser. The salads are fantastic and balanced, the seafood bright and fresh. Meats and poultry all arrive succulent, rich and satisfying.  Even the bar is a winner. But best of all, the serving and host staff are amazing. Friendly, prescient. You name it. I try not to eat there every week so I don't grow tired of it. But I would!"}
{"text":"Signature delicious small dishes with excellent plating.  Their wine selection is top-notch, and the service is superb.  The staff is knowledgeable on what wines pair well with the dishes offered.  Aesthetically pleasing decor, and intimate seating."}
{"text":"If you have not been . . . GO!  We went for dinner to celebrate Mother's Day.  Meal, service, decor, environment, and reasonable prices = perfection.  We could not find a single fault with anything.  A meal like this in Washington, DC, would cost double!  Server Evan was on his game, and assisted by other helpful and friendly staff.  Manager Christopher Calloway was very attentive!  We loved the bar choices, salad, bread plate, fried chicken slider (amazing!), short rib (reordered it because it was to die for!), Mac and cheese, tagliolini with mushrooms, Brussel sprouts, and swordfish.  Really terrific food . . . backed up by great, friendly service.  Will go back soon!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and wine, superb service too. The owner, Lucas, spends most nights working in the dining room with his staff. He is a sommelier too which means the wine list is the best in town. And his wife is spectacular pastry chef!  Back to the food. They serve small plates and large plates of both comfort food like fried chevre, and unique dishes like a Garganelli pasta. We love to slow play the dishes while we drink a specialty cocktail or one of their many wines by the glass.  It may sound crazy but I partially judge a restaurant by their bathrooms and they have the most luxurious water closests and a shared sink area.  The ambiance is warm and inviting with these comfy booths near the kitchen. The staff is sincere and kind. They must split tips because on any given night I have 3 or 4 different people helping serve and remove plates.   I could go on but you get the point. Go now, but try to make reservations as they fill up fast. They do have a bar area that I believe is first come first serve. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here in December,  and I couldn't stop talking about it back in San Francisco.  This place has some of the best employees, with amazing hospitality. I have tried so many dishes over the few days I was here. I would say my personal favorites were the pork belly,  beef tartare, Smoked tuna rillette, and the mac and cheese.  They come out with new stuff fairly often,  and that's what sets them apart from many restaurants in the area.  The chef really delivers on quality,  and the bartender, Scott makes sure you're drinking something that jives with your taste buds and your dish.  This is the one place I look forward to when I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Finally decided to pull the trigger and try out Graft. I was nervous about how to order since it is small plates. I didn't know how big the portions would be or how much would suffice. Thankfully our server was really cool and talked to us about the menu and the drinks ( I forgot our servers name but around 40s and grey hair).   We got the Chèvre, bread, chicken liver mousse, oyster po'boy, and the quail. Everything was really really good. Highlights for my girlfriend was the fried Chèvre, and the po'boy. For me it was the chicken liver mousse and the quail. Especially the quail, the mix of the sweet figs with the Farro and the salty quail was just delicious... We also got a cocktail, 2 glasses of special punch and 2 glasses of champagne. Everything added about to around $100 which I thought was a great price considering the portions and quality of food. We definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Graft is my favorite restaurant here in Madison. The portions are small so My husband and I ordered six dishes to share. We ordered Brussels sprouts, mussels, pork belly, farfalle, quail, and short rib. All of our dishes were fantastic! Everything was seasoned properly... not too salty, and not bland. The pork belly and short rib was so soft and tender. My husband hates Brussels sprouts but he devoured half the plate. Farfalle was my least favorite dish of the six but it was still pretty good. Mussels has a nice hint of curry that doesn't over power the dish. My favorite dish of the night was the quail. It's a nice sweet and savory dish, a must try if you're there! We will definitely be back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"Great food, terrific staff and management.  We had a large group with a few young children and they couldn't have been more attentive and friendly.  I'll be sure to come back every time we're in Madison, you should too."}
{"text":"Inventive, soulful food here, hats off the to inventive, attentive chefs and management!  We enjoyed immensely the crispy scallops with squash sauce, fried goat cheese with black pepper sauce, flank steak was crispy and tender and so much more, every bite was perfection!"}
{"text":"I started going to Graft several months ago and have quickly become a regular. While I typically grab a seat at the bar for cocktails I've also eaten at Graft on numerous occasions and attended some of their special events.  Most of the food is served in the small shareable plate format and I believe is very well priced for the quality and portion. My go-to has always been their macaroni and cheese which uses spaetzle noodles. Just skimming the other reviews I see I'm not the only one who loves this dish. On its own it's filling and enough for one person or easily shareable between two if you order something alongside it. One day I asked Scott, who was working behind the bar, if they could add some spice to it. The answer is yes, yes they can. Earlier that week they received Trinidad scorpion peppers from the farmers market. I like things insanely spicy and the dish was amazing but my friends oddly didn't agree. My other favorites are the short rib, bread plate, and when I'm feeling health conscious the brussels sprouts. There is a tremendous amount of thought and skill put behind the menu items at Graft and I'm confident that what I order will be great.  Just like the food, the menu cocktails are creative and well executed. I never expected I'd like a cocktail with a balsamic reduction and still cannot properly pronounce it's name but the Profligate Potation is a favorite. The housemade limoncello is also very good and highly recommended. All of the bar staff clearly have years of experience and are great to interact with. They all have their own variations on classic cocktails which I've enjoyed and can even do a good job with making something from scratch. I'm not much of a wine person but I've been slowly getting more into it. I really like what I've had the few times I decided to order a glass. While I'm definitely not a wine connoisseur I would expect one to be happy with their selection.  I have an office several blocks away from Graft and often have customers come in from out of town. A while back I had a lady come in raving about her experience at Graft. One of her biggest compliments was how happy the staff appeared. At the time I didn't really think anything of it but she is definitely correct. I'd expect any restaurant to have happy and friendly staff but Graft does seem to take it to a new level. Not sure what the catalyst behind this is but it unquestionably adds to the positive experiences I've had while dining there.  I would highly recommend giving Graft a try. It's always a fun time and great atmosphere. The music isn't blaring like some other popular establishments so talking to others in a large group is effortless and enjoyable. I have walked in on several occasions and found a table or spot at the bar during the dinner rush but I'd recommend calling ahead. Sometimes the wait can be a bit long."}
{"text":"First time at Graft was quite pleasant! I was quite happy with the quality of the food and the service. Our server, Sherman, was witty and goofy, which made our experience fun.   As other Yelpers have mentioned, the prices are quite high for the small amount of food that you actually receive. While I thought all the dishes I had were incredibly delicious -- and even said, \"these are the best scallops I've ever had!\" during dinner -- the bill at the end of dinner caused a little sticker shock. This is my reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5.  Even though I was really impressed with the service and food, I don't think I will go to Graft again for dinner. I think a visit to Graft is best suited for sharing a few apps and drinks, but not an entire dinner."}
{"text":"Went to this place three times with different groups when it first opened, and never went back. The service was extremely slow, the orders were wrong, the prices were high, the portions were small.  Looking at recent reviews, things may have changed. Will give it another try."}
{"text":"What an experience. If you go, ask for Sherman as your waiter and you are sure to get the \"Sherman show\" as the manager called it!! The wine list is awesome, currently it's a pilot since the place just opened last week. The dishes are all small, but good for sharing. I'd definitely recommend the artichokes and fried goat cheese. For the seafood the snapper was very tasty. We also got the pork belly and chicken thigh, both of which were very good too. Have fun when you go and try something new! The flavor combinations are very interesting and unique. They also have an awesome spot, right on the square adjacent to state street. The interior has a classic vibe and the wine collection is amazing. Definitely a fun place, but plan at least 2 hours due to the slow pace of the meal and ordering 2-3 small plates per \"course.\" The owner and chef both paid us a visit. They were very friendly and welcoming. The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that it was definitely pricey. It came out to about $80/person before tip but we also got a few bottles of wine and tried a lot of different things! I will be visiting again."}
{"text":"One of the gems in Madison. My wife and I love this place, been there 6-7 times.  A highlight in our lives for sure.  Scott, the bartender, is a master of his craft and full of knowledge.  The manager Chris is wonderful and can light up any room with his laugh and smile.  The service is superb; Brian was our favorite but he is no longer there.  Heidi and Tenzing are just are amazing. If youve never been, we recommend you try it."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and service!  Try the short rib...pure meat candy!!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Ambiance is great. This is the first time I visited. I had a hard time finding because of very little signage outside. Liked the coat check at the door....  Good drink and wine by the bottle menu. It was odd that we had so many different servers help us throughout our experience. Normally ok, but they were doubling up on service(e.g. drink refill, silverware, etc). I liked the variety in the menu. One thing you should know is that the majority of the plates are smaller than what a 'normal' serving would be. I had the salmon and it was full of flavor and filing. Other members in the party had the 1/2 chicken and scallops. They both said it was worth eating there."}
{"text":"This restaurant just continues to amaze and impress with every visit.  The food is exceptional.  The beet salad was so tender and light, it was the perfect appetizer. The quail in particular was so flavorful that it was absolutely to die for.  The drinks paired perfectly with the food.  The Profligate Potation was the perfect dinner drink.   The wait staff was extremely helpful, and managers made us feel welcome  and at home.  It was the perfect date night.  I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants a fantastic atmosphere and an absolutely delicious meal."}
{"text":"First time eating here and it was superb!  From the moment we walked in the door until the moment we left, the service was impeccable.  The servers actually wanted to SERVE you!  Plus they were more excited about the food than we were!  And the food, oh my goodness!  We ordered the beet salad, mixed greens, mac n cheese, potato pave and meatballs.  The mac n cheese and potato pave were my favorites.  Don't let the coffee ingredient scare you, it makes the potato dish even better.  I guess I was suppose to try the fried chèvre and totally forgot.  That's fine because I need to go back here again soon.  Also the chocolate pots de creme was out of this world!  Try it, you will like it."}
{"text":"Great service, perfect wine choice, cheese cake was like silk, plus the people make this amazing."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner here. It was not as expensive as yelp indicates. We had the Mac and cheese, fried chicken sliders, Brussels sprouts, and mushroom pasta and I liked all the dishes. This is located right behind the capital building, good location."}
{"text":"Good or bad, if you build an expensive small plates restaurant on the square, people will come.  My main issue is the tiny portions (at Chicago prices, you would expect more) and mediocre food. A plate of three small mushroom ravioli's for $12? Three tiny fried goat cheese pieces for $6? You might be noticing a pattern of three - which makes it virtually impossible to sample more than 1.5 full bites of a dish in a table of four. I don't want to go to a restaurant where the least common denominator of most tables is three. I do have to give them credit for the walleye served on beer granola - that is a nice dish.  The beer list is a disappointment (how is this possible in Wisconsin) and our server didn't really know his way around the menu. Decor 10% schizophrenic, 70% trendy. I don't think I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I don't remember the last time I wrote a review, but today I have to. My fiancé and I have recently moved from NYC to Madison, and in many ways this took some adjusting.. Last night he decided to take me out to Graft. The moment we walked in, the ambiance reminded us of the beautiful creativity you would see each time you'd walk into a 5 star NY restaurant... Without the cramped setting and crabby service. Speaking of service... In no other restaurant have we ever been given such special treatment! From being cheerfully greeted by the hostess, to the jovial and highly knowledgable waiter, to the owner who frequently made his rounds to make sure each of his patrons were taken care of, to the chef who personally came to our table to chat with us and, as a bonus, bring us complimentary dishes on the menu simply to gain our input on his craft.... Let's just say this doesn't happen everyday, and that this restaurant was just having a good service day. Even if we remove service from the experience, the food itself is enough for us to keep coming back and bring our out of town guests to show off Madison. We were able to try almost half the menu thanks to our talented and confident chef, Philip.  Brussel sprouts: Perfectly roasted with  a hint of sweetness Warm radish: this was one Phillip brought out as I would have never thought to order radish... And it ended up becoming my favorite fall/winter salad. I really can't describe it to do it justice... You just have to take a leap and order this one! Pappardelle with shiitake mushrooms: this fresh pasta melted in our mouths, with the mushrooms giving just the right amount of texture and bursting with flavor that we ended up ordering another.  Chèvre: you can never really go wrong with goat cheese, but we never had the combination of goat cheese with honeycomb before until now. Amazing. Mac and cheese: this was the first bite I had at this restaurant and will not be my last. If you are craving comfort food, this will deliver!  My fiancé also had the red snapper and tunatartare. He raved about the red snapper, and normally tuna isn't his dish... But in his words, he was impressed. Every dish seemed to have the perfect blend of taste, texture, and aesthetics so creative that it leaves you with a sense of wonderment with each bite. Not entirely sure why some have complained about the price.. For this type of food it would normally be double than what they charged.   We had absolutely no room for dessert after all this, but we look forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had the privilege of experiencing Graft for the first time on Saturday.  From the moment we walked through the door (loved the door handle, by the way) to the impeccable service to the incomparable food... I don't know how the evening could have been any better.  The ambiance is hard to define.  The bar and the artwork are modern but the tables, booths and seats reminded me of Grandma's kitchen.  I was delighted to get a partial view of the chefs at work.  The decor exudes class, right down to the restrooms.      The service was outstanding.  Accommodating and attentive without being uncomfortable or interrupting.  As I ordered a glass of whiskey, I noticed the waiter at the bar check my rocks glass for any thumb prints or marks.  As the night went on, I realized the waitstaff did this for all the glassware.  Our waiter then took the time to place the single glass of whiskey on the serving tray and bring it to our table.  It was just a single example of the attention to detail that goes into this dining experience.  We started with a braised beef tortellini with a mushroom broth that was on special.  At first glance of the menu, one may mistake the offerings to be boring.  The menu reads simple but upon closer inspection, the cuisine starts to take a more intriguing turn.  After the tortellini special, we went with the brussels sprouts served with candied pumpkin seeds and a balsamic reduction and the roasted beets topped with ricotta and a lemon vinaigrette.  The candied pumpkin seeds were a delightful counterpoint to the perfectly cooked sprouts.  And the lemon vinaigrette provided a much-needed juxtaposition to the naturally sweet red and gold beets.  Next was the Graft mac & cheese followed by the scallops.  The \"mac & cheese\" is an incredibly tender spaetzle with delicate cheese sauce.  It was not rubbery... it was not gummy... it was unlike any other mac & cheese I have ever had.  The scallops served with fennel and acorn squash were remarkable. I have never been able to get the sear like that on scallops.  The sear was strong, cooking the whole scallop from only one side.  I am not a huge fan of fennel, but the combination in this case was precise, accompanying the extraordinarily fresh scallops.   We finished up the meal with pork belly and the hangar steak.  The pork belly was tender on the inside with a crispy exterior.  Pickled mustard seeds cut through the richness of the pork belly.  It may have been my favorite dish of the night.  The hangar steak was delicious with perfect seasoning and cooked to a delicate medium rare.   As we were celebrating a special occasion, the evening was capped off with flourless chocolate cake served with whipped cream and raspberries accompanied by cups of coffee.  The perfect ending to an astounding dining experience.    Graft gets it right, meeting expectations and paying special attention to the subtle nuances, making for something truly exceptional.  The plates are constructed masterfully; everything is placed with a purpose.  The edges are wiped clean to guarantee full attention is given to the food.  New flatware is presented between courses.  Your napkin is folded for you upon returning from the restroom.  This is all accomplished while cultivating a comfortable ambiance.  It's a classy dining establishment, but I did not feel awkward wearing jeans.  We'll definitely be back.  Looking forward to trying some of the other items like the tartare, the cod fritters, the rillete, or the shrimp and grits that came on recommendation... or whatever else the menu has to offer.  With a place like this, its a pretty safe bet that everything is going to be delicious."}
{"text":"We were in Madison for a long weekend and stopped in Graft on a snowy night last weekend. The beautiful Capitol building lit up outside our window was almost hidden by the lightly falling snow--it was an amazing sight. The food also was great, especially my husband's swordfish and the pot de creme for dessert. Then as we helplessly waited for a taxi, the manager took charge and ordered up Uber on his own account (we're too old school to even know what that is). He walked us to the car around the corner and tucked us in. That was a really thoughtful extra that 'made' our night and made the memory even more special. Thank you for a memorable evening!"}
{"text":"Graft is a cool place. Great vibe inside.   We showed up without a reservation but we're accommodated very quickly and helped to the bar and then we secured a table by the window.   The wait staff was friendly and warm and knowledgable. The food was fantastic. It was much better than we expected actually. Small plates but great for sharing. Mac and Cheese was for real.   The only real negative was tight seating, it was way too close for tables of two and made things a little uncomfortable.   We will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautifully decorated, and the service was impeccable - Sherman was very knowledgable about wine and food pairings, and provided excellent hospitality throughout our meal. It's difficult to select a few favorites because I sincerely loved every plate I tried, but the potato pave, scallops and fried chèvre were especially amazing. Graft offers a refreshingly unique dining experience in the Capitol Square area, and I look forward to more meals here in the future!"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience overall. Great look to the place, really impressed by the service and the attention we got by the staff. The chef and managers came by often and conversation was natural and welcome. Can't say enough about the food- chicken thighs were divine. Perfect for a date or a group night out."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Graft recently or ever, I highly recommend it! Their cocktail list is one of the best in Madison. They also changed up their chef and therefore menu within the last year or so and the \"it factor\" that it was missing before is now there.  The shrimp and grits is amazing. Do not be put off by the head-on prawns, they're so much better that way. The wine list is also quite extensive and Lucas, the owner and the somm is always up for sharing his love for wine. Their signature Graft Pinot is definitely worth trying :)"}
{"text":"I have to say, upon my return to Madison I knew my first stop would be here because this is the best resturaunt in Madison! To my dissapointment they're closed on Mondays :(! However, I madw my way back tonight and it was incredible. I feel their $$$ isnt accurate, I'd say their more like $$ because they have many affordable items and it should be noted that $60 steak is to feed 4 people.. I had the delicious short rib as an appetizer-went back to my hotel to get a workout in and returned for dinner! Their staff is incredible and they have genuine relationships with their regulars as every other customer stops by to hug and greet the hostest and bar tenders. New items I tried tonight were the $5 fried chicken sliders (get 2)..  and this apple butternut squash salad that was Magnificent!!! I don't think I've eber used that word in a review but that salad is deserving of the compliment. Lol this is an automatic stop for me and will continue to be everytime I return."}
{"text":"Graft turned out being one of my favorite places I stumbled across in Madison. The atmosphere is great, they've even focused on the details -- like music playing in the restaurant coming from a record player behind the bar. The small plates I tried were all wonderful, as were the crafted cocktails. I liked it enough that I ate there two nights in a row because there was more I wanted to try. Especially enjoyed the beef tartare. I highly recommend it, and will be stopping back in next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"A solid addition to the Madison fine dining scene, and remarkably affordable for the level of quality. I'd even do a 4.5, but not a 5 since it doesn't rise to the level of the Admiralty room or the Tornado.  Short ribs and brussel sprouts are amazing, as are all the house cocktails. I went with friends and we all eat family style, and everything I tried was great. Good decor and service."}
{"text":"I've been here twice in the last week and have loved it. This restaurant holds its own alongside the high end restaurants in Madison and does so with a minimum amount of pretension. The food is all quite good, prices fair and the drinks quality. The service is great and it has to be said, swankiest bathrooms in Madison."}
{"text":"Great restaurant & great food.  When you walk in your immediately greeted by a host(s) and there's a choice of sitting at the bar or table service.  I chose the bar and Scott was my host.  The whole restaurant has a nice vibe to it, I love the idea of playing vinyl records to give a nice nostalgic feel.   In the next room over is a huge wine display room, so for those of you who love wine may want to check this joint out.  The menu selection is simple & all small plates. If you're like me & travel alone, this is great portion wise so the meal is a la cart and perfect for one person.  The Mac and cheese is amazing! It's creamy with little crunchy it of croutons to give it a bit of contrast and texture.  The best thing was the pork belly.   My first bite reminded of that scene in Ratatouille where the food critic takes a bite and is immediately transcended to a younger period where he was a child and experienced that same first bite.  That's how I felt when I had the pork belly. The blend of flavors took me back to a memory of growing up where I had those exact flavors.  To end it all up, I had the butterscotch cream dessert. Almost like a brûlée where the hard sugar is in the form of a toffee/brittle style cookie.  Such an amazing place & if I'm ever back in town, I hope to relive the experience.  Enjoy!  :)"}
{"text":"Had an incredible experience here and I don't know where to start. First, the staff are all AMAZING and that was really the highlight of the evening. Second, we ordered nearly all items on the menu, sparring the swordfish, steak  (they had sold out) and the quail. Everything was fabulous, beautiful and DELICIOUS. Third, the cocktails are marvelous. Love love love. What else can be said? The atmosphere was so lovely. It was a truly special evening with dear friends. We sat and dined and drank for 4 hours and the service was impeccable from beginning to end. We are from Southern California and this place would definitely hold its own against our LA eateries. Anytime we are in Madison we will always return. I highly recommend Graft for everyone. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"First of all, great service. Attentive, funny and professional. Second, wonderful location adjacent to the Capitol. But it's about the food, right ? Small plates, priced right, big vegetarian selection. We loved the grits/greens and egg- good grits topped with charred (smoky) kale and a perfect sunny side egg. Perfect. The Graft Mac and cheese tasted 7,999 times better than a rhyming product any parent may know (comes in a box). Kid friendly.  Desserts were fun,too, and the coffee was great. Thanks for having us."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to write a review because I felt sheepish saying that we heartily enjoyed the food but still would never likely return. The reason was that Graft's service was so over-attentive and cloying that we barely got a moment to ourselves on what was intended to be a relaxing, romantic night together. Every dish required an elaborate speech about every minuscule ingredient. The details are there on the menu, so why does each meal's composition require a second recitation? One of two servers - or the manager - stopped by about twice for every course or drink we ordered. At one point we were admittedly canoodling in our booth and the server came by to ask if we were enjoying our meal. Not any more! For Pete's sake, just walk away and let the customers enjoy their meals! I've experienced this same misstep elsewhere in Madison, but never to such a farcical extent. It was really unprofessional. Why can't we emulate Paris, one of the culinary capitals of the world, where servers bring you the food, return when summoned, and otherwise respect your privacy?  Another misstep was seating us directly next to a family of small children when the restaurant was otherwise empty. As a former restaurant hostess, I'm aware that that is THE LAST PLACE a young couple wants to be on a romantic night out.   In any event, there's my two cents. I wanted to like Graft (and still do!) because the decor is absolutely beautiful (puts Estrellón to shame) and the food is tasty on the whole. The pheasant and flank steak were both great. The doughnuts and ice cream for dessert were fantastic. (Drinks and wine selection? Absurdly pricey and off-base for Madison. Show me a decent glass of red for $6.) But I can't ever eat there again if I'm committing to share the experience with half the staff."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place missed the mark for us.  Everything was too overworked and overseasoned, and the service was lackluster.  We had the brussel sprouts, ahi tuna, spare rib, scallops and chicken.  The portions were solid, so we definitely had one dish too many for two of us.  And because the flavors were way too strong in all five of our selections, I was turned off by the time we got to the last couple of dishes.    Not sure if they intentionally tried to space the courses but there was a 25-30 minute lapse between our starter of tuna, our 2nd course of sprouts and scallops, and 3rd course of chicken and spare rib.  The server didn't set this expectation so we were a little thrown off because we weren't sharing all of the plates.  To top off this subpar experience, we sat in the overflow room which had no personality.  Definitely would not come here again."}
{"text":"The first 2 courses were great! The Beet Salad and the Potato Pave were both amazing! The capers gave the Pave an amazing boost the the dish! 2nd course - Scallops were good and had great flavor and presentation. The Tuna Tartare was average - Not too flavorful but not bad. 3rd Course - Meatballs were served ICE cold at only 5:30 pm not sure why it's not like they were busy BUT the waitress and manger both acknowledged and it was taken off the bill and the brought new ones that were hot. Hanger Steak was OK - nothing to knock our socks off but good. Overall - the service was great! Dishes were all good but nothing that I would insist on my friends or family ordering next time except the Potato Pave!"}
{"text":"Came here for date night on Friday and got a great seat by the window on the capitol.  Immediately, I liked the atmosphere and it had the right crowded feel....which gives a level of comfort that the word is out and the place is good.  Right off the bat we could tell that there might be a service issue as the first server came and offered water and said that he was backing up our actual server who would be coming by shortly.  When that didn't happen, \"back-up\" came back and offered to get us drinks.  This was 15 minutes after we had arrived and not sure why \"back-up\" hadn't offered to get us drinks in the first place.  Thus started a general service confusion over the course of the night which resulted in either feast or famine in the service department.    The bright spot- THE FOOD.  We started with the fried chevre, brussel sprouts and mac and cheese.  Awesome, right off the bat....the brussel sprout dressing got to be semi overwhelming but good to start.  The mac and cheese was so damn creamy and loved it.  The chevre was good- but its just not my favorite to begin with.  We then had the big eyed tuna which was my fave dish of the night....perfectly balanced with creamy, tart, crunchy, sweet....and the fish was very fresh.  We capped dinner off with the garganelli and short rib.  My husband was a huge fan of the short rib as it wasn't too fatty or greasy...the flavor really came out.  I thought the pasta was a little on the salty side but not bad.  We split the pot de creme and we both thought it was a little on the pudding-y side and have had better.  We are typically not huge fans of small plates as I usually stuff myself and I find that its typically more expensive but we'll be back as it was a delicious food experience in Madison."}
{"text":"Graft has easily become our favorite restaurant in Madison.  The best food, drinks, and people!  The macaroni and cheese, pork belly, short rib, carrot cake, and tacos are great!  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Graft is definitely a little pricy but it's worth the splurge. I've been here a couple of times and gotten a big mix of the food and liked almost everything. It's tucked away on the square with an almost hidden storefront and the atmosphere inside is equally cozy. My mom thought it was a bit loud but we also had a big group. Everyone really liked the mac and cheese and one of the breads on the bread plate was addictive.  Overall definitely a place I would come back to for special occasions/date night!"}
{"text":"I took my wife to Graft last night after several of my best clients recommended we go there for our anniversary.  We sat at the bar so we had the pleasure of interacting with the bar staff.  There were two bartenders, Scott and Evan.  Both were very friendly and attentive.  Scott took fabulous care of us, and once he knew it was our anniversary, he really helped make the evening special.  I was most impressed with how he listened to our likes and dislikes.  Every single thing he introduced us to was spot on.  I particularly loved the balsamic based drink he made for us.  We also had a fabulous chardonnay.  Both names escape me as we were in full celebration mode...our daughter picked us up and drove us home so don't judge.  Regarding the food, I had the market special small plate which was hand selected by Chef Phillip at the farmer's market earlier that day.  The special was a combination of different types of tomatoes and herbs in a cucumber water base.  I loved every thing about it, especially the Sun Gold Tomatoes.  We then ordered the beef tartar and hanger steak small plates on Scott's recommendation.  Both plates were wonderful and well proportioned for small plates.  The beef tartar was out of this world.  I have a very short list of foods I crave on a regular basis, and that list grew by one last night.  Chef Phillip personally delivered our plates and shook our hands, wishing us a happy anniversary and asking for our feedback, which was a really, really nice gesture.  I mean how many chefs have you ever met personally?    I didn't read any reviews until this morning and I am glad I didn't.  Not to discredit any of the previous reviewers, but there is a reason why Southpark did an entire episode about Yelp snobs.  If you are a person with normal tolerances for your fellow human beings and an appreciation for people trying to do something special, you will enjoy Graft.  I felt like my money was well spent, and well earned. We will definitely be going back to Graft and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend Graft to our friends for a special night out."}
{"text":"First, the good: the server was friendly, the ambiance was nice, the food came out quickly and looked beautiful (taste was another matter), the fried chevre and the tuna tartare were delicious, and the desserts were excellent.   Now, the bad: Two out of the three glasses of (red) wine at the table had so much sediment in them that it looked like chewing tobacco had been spit in them.  I'm no wine snob, but I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to serve wine by the glass with a crapload of sediment in it.  The guy pouring the water said \"that's normal\" but our waiter removed the glasses quickly and we saw him examining it in the light, like \"what the heck?!\"  But he didn't comment on it and we were too polite.  Maybe that's our fault, but given how they pride themselves on their wine, I would have thought they would have fixed it without us having to cause a fuss.  Also, the  salt cod was like eating a block of pure salt.  We all like salty foods, but it was like they were trying to punk us to see if anyone reacted.  Trust me, you don't want to order this.    The mediocre: The mac and cheese was very mild/bland and the meatballs tasted like they came out of a can.  Not something you expect at a high quality restaurant, but, well, at least we didn't feel like we were eating a salt block, which was a win at this point.  The hangar steak was a little tough but the bread pudding that came with it was pretty good.    All in all, I could see recommending this place for desserts but there are plenty of better options nearby for your meal."}
{"text":"What a treat! All that was offered was delivered, and with such impressive execution. If they don't wow you with their food (get the swordfish!!), they'll pique your interest with their wine selection - there were some on there that I'd definitely never heard of before. And should the wines not inspire you, take a look around; the feng shui, chic interior design and ideally dimmed lighting are sure to put you in the mood to stay for bite or two or three!   Thank you, Graft, for such a delightful dining experience!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a fabulous evening at Grady last night with my father. The welcoming host monica welcomed us to the \"chefs table\", where they gave us a few sample dishes for free. We had the fried chèvre with honey and black pepper, shrimp and grits (my favorite) beef tartar, and Brussels sprouts with pumpkin seeds. Wonderful service and a nice environment."}
{"text":"Had a great time here several months back while in town for a conference.  The staff and food were both amazing and worth the 5 stars. We had a larger group and they were able to accommodate us immediately.  The food was top notch.  The Mac and Cheese was like a party in my mouth!  Seriously.  We had to order several more to satisfy everyone's taste buds. The Brussels sprouts were great as well.  Great place for meat and plant lovers.  The cocktails were tasty and decently priced.  I would definitely recommend Graft next time you are in Madison."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and I came to eat here twice!! Food is amazing. It's small plates so it's a great place for spending time with friends in a casual hip atmosphere. They have gone OVER THE TOP with service. There is no such thing as \"looking for your server\". They are attentive yet not obtrusive or rushed. Melissa was our primary server both nights with other very nice and capable folks checking in and bringing delicious dishes throughout the night. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"They have 5-star ambiance and 4-star food! I visited Graft with the rents, so with three people we got to taste a decent proportion of the menu. Didn't try any wines with my food, so maybe that took away from the taste- because the dishes were great, but not as excellent as their pretty plating promised. I tried the no-booze cocktail with orange and shrub (back side of the drink menu)... I didn't know that shrub is a sweetened drinking vinegar so I was very surprised by the drink-- but pleasantly! If you hate vinegar though, steer clear. The hamachi crudo was fresh 'n good. The beet salad was fabulous; all the beets were cooked to perfection and we loved the colors! Anddd the crunch of the spicy sunflower seeds. The seeds also stood out in the Brussels sprout dish- crunchy pumpkin ones. Nom. The steak tartare ruled; very rich and filling. I was not a fan of the shrimp and grits- too smoky and some weird flavor combos in there. The standout dish was the garganelli pasta with pork, rapini and burrata. I could tell how fresh the pasta was and the sauce was to die for- if you're gonna get one thing, get this! The service was excellent, the booths (my seating of choice- yessss!) were comfortable.... and the bathrooms are super cool. Try Graft, and indulge in some wine for a higher quality experience!"}
{"text":"Really friendly staff, loved the food and atmosphere. Pot de creme dessert was fantastic."}
{"text":"Service was excellent .  Decor, was okay .  But, after all the hype, Graft was just meh .  The food presentation was good, but the cooking was off. The seasonings might have been good, but the execution was so flawed...  The chevre en gastrique were good, I guess, but it's hard to mess up that flavor profile.  The scallops with sunchokes? The scallops were overcooked, oversalted. Sunchokes okay.   The brussels sprouts were unevenly cooked, unevenly seasoned, entirely unbalanced, just not good. I didn't finish a favorite veggie.  The swordfish was overcooked and unevenly seasoned. It was served over a bland, watery sweet potato puree, with oversalted haricots verts.   Maybe if you like looking at food more eating it but don't care about Instagramming (lighting insufficient).  For me, just no."}
{"text":"Loved my meal at Graft. The staff treated us kindly, gave great recommendations, and the food was delicious. I enjoyed the atmosphere and totally recommend Graft as an ideal date spot. The ambience and energy was perfect for conversation, and I could tell that the folks working here seemed to be pretty dedicated to ensuring diners had a great experience. My husband and I look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have loved this place time and time again. We go here for our birthday dinners and for other special occasions. The service is the best we have had in Madison. They know their food so well, but they don't make you feel bad if you have a question or don't know as much as them. Food is so dynamic and delicious. I recommend the profligate potation (cocktail), friend chèvre, oyster po'boys (even if you're not keen on oysters), to name a few. Could not recommend more, they have been excellent time and time again."}
{"text":"Had the small plates and everything was delicious! Short ribs, Mac & cheese & ceviche were my favorites! Service was awesome! They had great recommendations & service. Very personable!"}
{"text":"First dinner out with my husband for months after having our second child. Both of us said it was the best service we could remember in a long time. The food was wonderful, especially the green fried tomatoes. We loved it and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good food and a beautiful experience! I went opening weekend, so they were very receptive to feedback and the service was excellent.   Many of the dishes that I tried had interesting twists that,in my opinion, worked very well. The standouts for me were the hint of grapefruit with the scallops and the coffee butter with the spinach accompanying the flank steak. I could have had a whole meal of that spinach and have been happy. The fried chèvre and the tuna tartare also deserve a shout out; they were phenomenal.   You won't leave stuffed but you will leave satisfied."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and have not been disappointed.  This feels almost like a hidden gem on the square as there's not much signage on the outside, but the inside is beautiful - great atmosphere and decor! Also check out their bathroom, so nice!  The menu is a little limited but the one thing I get every time is their Graft Mac and Cheese! The cheese mixture is delicious with small spiral noodles (not your typical Mac and cheese noodles) and little croutons on top! A waiter told me once to add the smoked trout on top - I liked it but it didn't wow me, plus then the plate becomes over double the regular price.   We also got the roasted beets and pork belly tonight. Both were good! Not a huge fan of the sweetness in the grilled asparagus you got with the pork belly, too sweet.   Other tasty items are the scallops, Brussels sprouts, beef tartare, and cannot forget dessert!   We ordered the vanilla bean semifreddo! So delicious with the candied almonds and blueberry glaze. Semifreddo (means semi-frozen) - was like a tasty frozen vanilla bean cream. So yummy!"}
{"text":"My god, talk about pretentious food. Maybe they're called \"Graft\" because the amount they're charging you for the quantity of food you're getting would qualify as graft under US law.  I came here on a date hoping to make a good impression, as well as wanting to try this new restaurant out. We are seated, and a *very* enthusiastic waiter starts talking. He talks in detail about where they source their meat and seafood. He talks about how the chef has trained in the best institutions and uses complex and bizarre methods to do all sorts of unnecessary contrivances that bear little on improving the taste of the food. For example, we ordered tuna tartare, which when served was the size of a box of matches, and they came with these white, fluffy crunchy rice chips, the only purpose that I can surmise is to try and fill the customer's stomachs. Apparently making these chips takes some sort of mad scientist chemistry that I'm supposed to be impressed by. Also, despite what appears to be an extensive and varied menu, because the portion sizes were so small, we had to continually order things to the point where we ended up having a large proportion of the menu. So beware - the menu is actually smaller than it looks.  A fine example of how this restaurant thinks it's better than everyone else can be seen in their wine menu. They don't bother to offer the traditional - your Bordeaux, your Chianti, your Rioja. Instead they go for \"alternative\" offerings focusing on California, New Zealand, and such. I suspect that it's cheaper for them and possibly for the customer.  At the end of the day, my chief problem is that this restaurant doesn't know what it is. I understand tapas as a concept, and I appreciate the silly but apparent effort the chefs put in to making their food unnecessarily complicated, but if the bill comes out to more than $200, you're starting to put yourself in Michelin territory. And you're not there yet. Trust me, I've been to the French Laundry. But what then makes it worse is that this restaurant is going to give the wrong impression to people. These prices demand a higher level of service, and it's just not here. I'm not saying that the food is bad - au contraire, the food overall is delicious - but if this restaurant thinks it can substitute appearances for substance, then it is sorely mistaken."}
{"text":"Always an amazing meal with wonderful service. The folks at Graft create a warm, welcoming environment and the kitchen knocks the food out of the park."}
{"text":"I give them credit for striking out on their own. Hey, at least it's not another Food Fight restaurant and Big T Miller has nothing to do with it.   Ingredients are top notch. I really like the chef's story (self made man from a diverse background) and the food was delicious.   Menu is quite small, which is fine, but wow, portions are tiny. I'm ok w tiny portions and big prices if the food is going to blow my mind and satiate me because it's so tasty. Graft is not there.   As others have said, lower prices or larger portions and I'm there. Look, I'm not asking for sloppy, gross, unrefined Great Dane portions, I'm just asking to leave relatively satiated (not \"full\") after dropping a C note+ for two.   Drinks are really good, but again, I don't care how good drinks are this isn't NYC so let's take things down just a notch. Keep Wisconsin great with cheap booze.   Lastly, I get we're all eco and green but NO ONE likes to look at their date under LED spotlights at the bar. NO ONE.   Service was ok. It's a new place so I'll give them some slack.   Some plates are there, but overall it's another new Madison restaurant that fills the desires of the nouveau riche looking to spend 'big city' money in a town where the food scene mostly hasn't risen to those levels (yet, hopefully)."}
{"text":"Very classy new restaurant on the square. The staff is highly interactive and pleasant! The food comes in small tapas sized portions and comes in a very wide range of prices.   I loved the simplicity of the dishes. We shared Mac & cheese, fried chèvre, smoked trout rillette, ravioli, red snapper, and pheasant. A few of the dishes were quite salty, like the mushrooms in the ravioli, trout and red snapper. The fried chèvre was my favorite! I wanted to lick the plate clean of the caramelized balsamic drizzle.   One of the chefs presented the red snapper to our table and told us his inspiration behind the dish and had a conversation with us."}
{"text":"With a menu of unusual cocktails (you MUST try the Profligate Potation!) to the array of sharable dishes, I was thoroughly impressed by my meal at Graft.   The scallops with arugula and black truffle were amazing, as well as the jasmine rice salad with green goddess dressing and the brussels sprouts with balsamic glaze. For three of us, we were content sharing three small plates, two large plates and a desert (it's not on the menu, but Graft's seasonal November desert was literally, as our server described it, fall in a bowl).  While the final bill was on the pricier side, I found it to be incredibly fair and more reasonable than most tapas/ small-plates style dining I've experienced. Highly recommend Graft for anyone looking for a nice evening out in Madison!"}
{"text":"The menu is odd.  The bread and fried chevre was good drizzled with honey, but the menu selections were an odd combination.  I am not a picky eater, but am not a fan of pork belly, pate, scallops, tuna tartare.  The oyster po boy contained 2 oysters. I guess that was OK for $5? The frisee salad was expensive for not a lot of lettuce. The braised brussel sprouts were very good.  Also, if the dishes are meant to be shared it is difficult to share 3 scallops, or 2 oysters, or a bowl of tagliatelle and shrimp, or one piece of pork belly.  There are a number of other restaurants that I would recommend that are just as expensive."}
{"text":"what a great place!  the variety of portion sizes and menus selections were great!  i love Titos vodka and this place infuses its own with lemon.... the perfect drink you must try is the Profligate Potation!"}
{"text":"Bright side:  Cocktails and wine were very good, the bread was delicious and attentive service gets 4.5 stars.  But these perks did not compensate for overpriced/under-flavored food.  Scallops and pappardelle were bland, and the salmon was dry.  Left hungry because I'm an eating beast and these portions are for people who are OK paying $0.25/calorie."}
{"text":"No matter how you look at it Graft is one of the more fine dining restaurants that is instantly recommended to you in Madison. Now I've come to learn the hard way that Glowing Reviews often at times can be deceptive. Graft, on the other hand, did justice to its own!!  The decor of this place throws across a trendy industrial vibe which I find a lot more inviting than a vintage or classic one per se. So well done on that front!  Service is an interesting conundrum coz if it were a \"normal\" restaurant I'd be totally fine with it. For a fine dining one, it didn't hit the mark. Inattentive and rather confusing is how I would describe our experience. Every round was served by a different person and we had to actually ask to remove plates and subsequent orders. No checking in on us or any other formal service etiquette were shown. Again not to nit pick but I expect such nuances from a Fine Dining place.  The food, however, turned it all around for us! Scintillating is how I'll describe the tapas style dishes and their play on flavors and ingredients. We kicked things off with Fried Chevre and Graft Mac n Cheese. The goat cheese with its pairing of a pepper honey glaze was a star! With an almost non existent fried coating, it simply melted in your mouth so much more elegantly than say a mozzarella. The saltiness of the goat-cheese with the sweet spiciness from the glaze was a sensual dance in the taste-buds! The Mac n Cheese was a more up-scaled version one and I love the thicker consistency of Gouda holding the spatzle together. Not the best of dishes but really good interpretation of Mac n Cheese!  Moving ahead, we tried their tuna salad, the pork belly, chicken liver mousee and finally the Quail. The tuna salad was fresh, light and reminded of a form of poke. Apple shavings were a surprising pairing which actually made it better. The Pork Belly was exquisite! Melt in your mouth goodness. What really took me by surprise was that accompaniment of Asparagus with pickled mustard seeds & szechuan peppercorns. The little bubbles burst in your mouth and give a whole new dimension to the otherwise nice but bland asparagus. The Chicken Liver Mousse with its onion marmalade and crostini's was a refreshing departure from the other \"hot\" entrees. The mousse itself was seasoned very well and the sweetness from the marmalade balanced the saltiness perfectly. The Quail was my first. The bird itself is very small but the meat was a lot more defined than say a chicken. Cooked al dante, it brought out its strong flavors. The accompaniment of farro with fig n bacon was so so good that I couldn't keep my hands of it!!  Service aside, the food here is very flamboyant and true to a fine dining establishment. Far more that some of its competitors I've been to recently!!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough good stuff about this place. The GM came by to make sure we were doing ok. The food was wonderful. Just as good as anything we've had in NYC, Chicago, Hong Kong, France. The chef and staff are great. Just eat here!"}
{"text":"After my negative review o our first visit, I appreciated their staff reaching out to me. Shows a general care and concern for their guest's experience. I look forward to returning to try it again."}
{"text":"The chef is VERY talented!  Everything was delicious!  The house wine (a Willamette Valley Pinot) is made by Brooks and is wonderful."}
{"text":"When I planned ladies' night, I looked for a restaurant that would provide a fun atmosphere with delicious food and a touch of class. I reserved a dinner at Graft through Yelp, and we were not disappointed. I came here with a group of 8 ladies and we were seated in the back by the kitchen. The whole restaurant is filled with the noises of the kitchen and the different smells of wine and delicious food. The wine list is very eclectic and long (perfect for ladies' night), and the sommalier was knowledgeable and gave us gentle recommendations towards wines that we enjoyed immensely.  I had the fried chevre with the chicken thigh. Fried chevre is possibly some of the best bites of food I've had in Madison. The crispy crunch on the outside mixed with the creamy decadent goat cheese on the inside, throw in some nuts and honey, and you get fireworks. We ended up sharing with ladies who didn't order it because they were in love with ours. Chicken thigh was also delicious, but the fried chevre is the stronger recommendation. Our friends ordered the pork belly and the brussel sprout salad. Though I didn't try it, she said the brussel sprouts were delicious.  Service was wonderful and attentive. Our server refilled our drinks and checked on us frequently when our wine was low. Food did not take long at all to prepare. Overall, I believe the whole dinner (appetizers, drinks, and entrees) took a little over an hour. We were very happy with the pacing and the service. I loved every second of this dinner, and I definitely plan on coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal. The short rib and the mac and cheese were the standouts but everything we tried was delicious. The staff was extremely friendly from the moment we walked in the door and the service was near perfect. Great cocktails too--I had the Huey Lewis and Dewars, and my husband had the Fancy Water. Both great. I also tried their rotating punch, which was refreshing and delicious. A perfect take on Midwestern tapas--we'll definitely stop in again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just had a wonderful experience here. We had the mac and cheese, Brussels, pork shoulder pasta dish (blanking on the name), and scallops. The pasta dish was one of the best dishes I've ever had, and I loved the spaetzel take on mac and cheese (and the Italian truffles added in were amazing).  Dessert was equally delicious and if they have the apple cake definitely get it!  Also they have a great wine selection and the Coravin pour was delicious. All around, I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I will not perpetuate the suspense, this restaurant is as good as everyone thinks it is. We had dinner last Friday for a special birthday dinner. Chris told us that the large plate Halibut dish was awesome, after eating it he downplayed how good it was. I have eaten many many dishes in my 43 years and this was the best dish I've ever had in my life.  To me if a dish sings it is more than the sum of its parts and that doesn't happen that often. You can technically cook a dish to perfection but superseding that is pure genius. A huge thanks to the other staff that waited on us: Chris and Brianna. It was a very special night and you guys helped make it a night I will never forget. Thanks a million! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Enjoyed trying several small plates. The short ribs were a stand-out, so tender and flavorful. The brussel sprouts were cooked perfectly and lived the pumpkin seeds and balsamic glaze. The chèvre was light and I enjoyed the sweet/spicy combo of honey and pepper. It's hard Togo wrong with pork belly! The Pots de creme was divine...very rich and enough for two people to share."}
{"text":"Went here with my husband for a cute dinner while we were on a weekend escape to Madison.   We were early on a Saturday night, so it was pretty quiet. I liked the vibe- very much your typical New American farm to table kind of vibe with cute lighting and comfy booths. The booths were actually adorable. Love them.   The service was good- attentive and nice and friendly overall.   The food was pretty good. Some things like the cod and  the fried chevre were just not that special and were overpriced. Some things like the scallops were delicious. The beets were ok but definitely overpriced, and the pork belly was really tasty to me but my husband didn't love it.   I would go there again in the fall for a hopefully slightly refreshed menu. It feels a bit small, and i think they  should just get rid  of the large plates altogether. Replace with 6 new small plates, with at least 2-3 of those being veggie-focused.   Overall I liked it, and would recommend and would probably go again, it just  feels like the menu still needs a little extra love to be perfected."}
{"text":"We've found our new favorite restaurant in Madison. Food was awesome! We came in pretty hungry, so we ordered quite a bit...  Ambience: cozy, great date night spot or place for small groups, right on the capitol  Food: amazing. Flavorful, fresh, locally sourced. Small plates, so get multiple to share. We had... -Bread plate: get it just for that roll. Bread came out warm, as it should. Still thinking about the roll... -Brussel sprouts: YUM. Balsamic + candied pumpkin seeds + Brussels is a unique combo that really worked. -Pork belly: INTO IT. Since it's a fatty cut of meat, it's not always my favorite - but the tangy Asian-inspired sauce and soba noodles were a perfect balance. Crispy outside, tender inside. Perfection. -Scallops: My bf is a big scallops fan, and he looved these. Great combo with the arugula and sunchoke. Yum. -Short ribs: comforting with the port wine reduction sauce + cauliflower. Tender, flavorful.  -Mac and cheese: A thing of dreams. Seriously. Sometimes gourmet Mac and cheese just tastes super heavy and one-note, but this one sang. So many flavors, some crispiness on top for texture. Want.   Desserts: the only part that didn't completely wow me, but I don't really care. We got the apple upside down cake and chocolate cake. Both were good, not great.   Service: super friendly, warm, not pretentious at all, inviting. Our first three dishes could've been spaced out a little, but it was so good that this didn't bother me.   Thanks for a superb date night, Graft! You guys rock."}
{"text":"We had the ceviche, fried chicken, and ribeye.  All were excellent and portion sizes were commensurate with the price. Ribeye definitely large enough to share.  Great cocktails.  Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"This isn't just great food it's a great experience. From the front of the house staff that greeted us at the door to the waiter, back waiter, Chef, two owners and the cute guy that told us we were the best table of the night, you are all so gracious, warm and real. Wonderful wine list and the best shrimp and grits in Madison. Going back Tuesday night for taco Tuesday and plan to eat at the chef's table in the near future. It was a great night with warm friendly people great food and great wine"}
{"text":"Pricey but food was delicious. Especially enjoyed the pork belly."}
{"text":"Outstanding location On the Square.  The dishes were creative and delicious, opting for the small plates of greens, a wonderful papardelle, to-die-for fennel scallops, the hanger steak that even my mostly veterinarian wife loved, and the best roasted beet salad I've had in Madison.  The service was attentive from our waiter, the maitre d and chief but still got us in and out in time for our 7:00 curtain.  We will be going back often when we can get in."}
{"text":"This is one of the bst places I've been to in Madison for contemporary American food. I have a soft spot for European food (especially French) and this place really patches up the hole for the type of food I'm always craving. Every dish I had here was awesome. They have a small plate like experience which I love since you're able to have more variety with your meal. Their bread was delicious, the pasta dish we had was also amazing. I have nothing bad to say about this place, definitely stop by!"}
{"text":"Graft was totally awesome.  Another affirmation that Madison is the best foodie mini-city in the midwest.  Our group of 4 shared a bunch of dishes, but the standouts were the jasmine rice salad (rec'd by the waiter - we never would have ordered it otherwise), mac and cheese (get at least 1 for every 2 people in your group!), and the short rib.  But really everything we had was great.  Special shout out for the Huey Lewis and Dewar's, which my husband loved."}
{"text":"Three friends and I had dinner at Graft before a concert.  All were highly complimentary of their selections.  The shrimp and grits were extraordinary. The desserts were also outstanding.  The menu offerings are unique, creative and based on our experience perfectly prepared.  The service is good even though it is very busy. I would recommend getting a reservation."}
{"text":"Fantastic! The only joint that is comparable to the quality of tapas offered at Eno Vino."}
{"text":"Went there for some late night dining.  Great atmosphere and servers.  The bar was well stocked and menu small but interesting.  I had the Brussels sprouts with pumpkin seeds and balsamic glaze and the short rib with cauliflower.  The short rib was melt in your mouth tender with plenty of flavor and the freshly grated horseradish on the side provided a bright kick.  Aside from being on the salty side both dishes hit the spot.  A well balanced Riesling was a great pairing."}
{"text":"PROS: Tasty, tapas-style dining CONS: Some hits and misses  Cute spot. The red snapper and smoked salmon rilette were well-cooked and scrumptious, and the warm radish salad soothed my tastebuds with its warm cinnamon flavors, but the tuna tartare, signature Graft mac and cheese, and fried chèvre lacked dimension and creativity. Frankly, I expected more."}
{"text":"For long time I didn't have such a good food. Small plates but very very good.  And - very important: great service."}
{"text":"My dinner at Graft was one of the very best I have ever had. It was so amazing that I have to break my usual trend of writing short reviews to fulfill the moral imperative to let the entire world (or at least all of Yelp) know how unbelievable this restaurant is.   Bread Plate: The house roll was soft and delicious and the sea salt butter was incredible. The baguette was not as delicious as the roll but still very good. The roll alone made the bread plate 100% worth ordering at only $3.   Brussels Sprouts: HANDS DOWN THE BEST I'VE EVER EATEN. I am not kidding. They were almost my favorite part of the meal. Almost. The brussels sprouts were unbelievably prepared, and the pumpkin seeds and balsamic glaze made them taste absolutely perfect. I will still be talking about these brussels sprouts in 5 years.   Mac & Cheese: My new favorite restaurant mac & cheese. The buttermilk spätzle is to die for and the gouda puts this dish over the top. No mac & cheese dish I've ever had at a restaurant has come close to this.   Pork Belly: I do not usually like fattier cuts of meat, but this literally melted in my mouth in the most incredible way. It fell apart at the touch of the knife when I cut it in half to share with my husband, and the meat had the most unbelievably sweet, savory flavor. The grilled asparagus accompanying this dish was exceptional.   Short Rib: This meat also fell apart at the touch of the knife and had a rich, juicy flavor. The cauliflower served with this dish was so delicious it was almost as good as the meat.   My husband and I do not usually like tapas style dining because the portions are often too small to truly enjoy the dish, but Graft offers generous, satisfying portions for the price. There was not a single thing we ordered that we did not find to be absolutely exceptional. I honestly hope to meet the chef one day, because this was the most creative, well-prepared meal I have ever had, and all of the ingredients and flavors blended beautifully together to create fantastic, memorable dishes. I would give this restaurant ten million stars if I could."}
{"text":"Wonderful place! It'd been a while since I'd been there - nearly since its opening - but I left feeling disappointed I haven't come here more often. The staff was so kind and welcoming and the food was outstanding. We ordered the Brussels sprouts, mixed greens salad, shrimp and grits, the half chicken and the profiteroles for dessert. The only thing we could maybe have skipped was the salad, noting terribly special but somehow still a great starter and very fresh and light. We'll definitely be back soon - we were told they have taco Tuesdays and if the food we had yesterday was any indication the tacos will be some of the best in Madison. Overall, top 5 Madison restaurants in my book for food but the staff and ambiance are wonderful as well. All around five stars! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Five of us requested the chef's table and among us tasted almost everything on the menu. The staff was personable, informed, and attentive -- especially Tabitha and a lovely woman with an apron full of pens and a hilarious waiter named Sherman. We loved every minute with the chef and his crew as they explained the complexly designed food. The recipes were like a Mozart sonata (according to the professional musician at the table) -- every note significant, no note too many. Each dish was a little gem that someone at the table claimed as his or her favorite. With drinks and dessert -- all of which were excellent -- it came to about $75 a person including tip."}
{"text":"Great meal of freshly prepared items. I was able to walk in with no reservation a little after 5pm on a Saturday in spring. Had brussell sprouts, Cornish hen, and then splurged for dessert and had creme brûlée. All were outstanding!"}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time for my birthday dinner a couple of weeks ago. The decor and ambience are delightful -- a sort of industrial modern thing, and their small-plate, tapas-style menu made it really easy for my partner and I to sample a lot of different tasty food without breaking the bank. The wait staff and kitchen were also wonderful about accommodating our food allergies (mine to gluten and my partner's to dairy.)  For starters, we got the roasted beet salad, which was fabulous; everything was cooked perfectly, and the crunch of the spiced sunflower seeds along with the ricotta was quite tasty. We also got the balsamic-glazed Brussels sprouts with candied pepitas, which were equally good.  We then moved on to the scallops, which were cooked well, and accented with greens and black truffle; and pork belly with pickled mustard seeds and asparagus (probably my favorite dish of the evening, since we couldn't enjoy the mac & cheese!) the pickle on the seeds balanced the fattiness of the pork belly perfectly; the asparagus was decent, but nothing to write home about.  The wine list is extensive, and cocktails creative. Definitely recommended if you're looking for a nice, slightly upscale place to try out, or have guests in town you want to dine out with."}
{"text":"The food and service was AMAZING!!  We stopped in on a Friday night, the place was packed and they initially said we would have to wait 1.5hrs.  After some convincing, they were really nice and seated us right away.  We started with the bread plate.......Spend the $3 and get this plate!!! The bread was warm, soft, and just freaking amazing.  For a table of 4 I would suggest getting 2 orders.  We also tried the ahi tuna....which I had never had tuna before, and it was freaking really good.  It was on a bed of noodles and seasoned perfectly.  We also had the mac & cheese and short rib.  I would almost suggest you combine the two because they taste amazing together.    They also have a HUGE selection of wine and local beers.  Overall an excellent addition to the Madison area and can't wait to go back and try other items on the menu"}
{"text":"They have a turn table and we played old school Hall & Oats. So cool and fun."}
{"text":"BEAUTIFUL restaurant with awesome service and good, but expensive for the portion sizes food.  The decor reminds me of a cozier Cento. Love the booths (they remind me of little cabanas). I love that you can see them cooking, too!  Fun, friendly and helpful servers.  So the menu reminds me of the menu at A Pig in a Fur Coat in that it's mostly smaller plates designed for sharing. However, in practice, most of the dishes at Graft are not actually shareable. I think the main difference in the actual food between Graft and PIAFC is that the Graft food is not quite as decadent so you actually want more than a bite. However, my group of 4 shared a lot of dishes and we really only got a tiny bite of each. We left hungry and still paid a lot. Each dish was like $5 per bite.  We loved most of the food, though! I think I would just go back with one other person and be prepared to spend a lot.   Favorites include the beef tartare, flank steak and ravioli. The macaroni and cheese was the only thing I didn't like. Too smoky, but people apparently love it. The fried chèvre was good but not all that interesting and the scallops were yummy with that hint of grapefruit but really not feasible for sharing. Great cocktails and wine, too.   This is definitely a place for a special occasion. An anniversary date, not a group dinner with friends!"}
{"text":"The small plates were fantastic and the sommelier was a lot of fun to talk wine with throughout the night.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Loved loved loved! Traveled from Los Angeles to Madison (and my fav burger is Graze), but on the 2nd night we wanted to try a new spot. Most unique/delicious swordfish ever!! Great wine list and very helpful staff. Mac n cheese was unreal as well-- definitely order that!!"}
{"text":"We went here last night for my wife's birthday. I mostly write all my reviews based on 3 points; atmosphere, food/ drink, and service.   Atmosphere- pretty dang cool. Started out right as you walk in with this really cool tile wall that separates the entrance from the restaurant. Nice large bar that is lined with old barn wood. This place has one major piece of art that is pretty neat. Hahaha wait until you see the bathrooms.... Very interesting (not in a bad way).  Overall very nice... You feel comfortable.   Food- the food was good, but not great. Let me say this- I'm 300lbs so let's face it I'm not a huge fan of small plates! BUT I do appreciate food served this way when it is done right. We had artichokes (okay), pork belly (over cooked), flank steak (very good) shrimp in a red sauce (very good) and half chicken (awesome)! The wine was very good also. The food is NOT the reason why this place got 5 out of 5.   Service- this is 100% why this place got 5 out of 5 stars. I can't express how accommodating and friendly the staff was. The owner (Lucas) stopped by a few times to chat. They have 2 waiters per table which they call a front and back waiter. You would think it would get annoying, but it doesn't. My wife has celiac (gluten-free) and they were very knowledgeable on the menu items. They honestly want you to have a great experience.   Overall very nice experience. It is a little pricey for what you get, but if you are into food experiences... That doesn't matter so much. Will we be back? Yes, eventually (if you catch my drift)."}
{"text":"My fiance and I had dinner at Graft on Friday night. If you're looking for fine dining and like to share small plates, then Graft is the place for you. The space is really beautiful. The food was excellent, and so were the drinks. The fried goat cheese is as good as everyone says it is! We almost ordered a second plate of the chicken liver pate/mousse because it was so good. Food and ambiance are an easy 5 stars.   The only reason I can't give Graft 4 or 5 stars is because the service kind of rubbed me the wrong way. We were seated by the hostess, and then we were asked if we wanted water by what I assumed was our waiter. Then, another man came over after the first left and let us know that he was in fact our waiter. But as the night went on, we saw pretty equal time with each waiter. Throughout the night it was a little confusing; it felt like we had 2 waiters, 2 others delivering food and clearing plates, and then 2 managers that visited our table often to chat and make sure things were alright. While I appreciate management stopping by to check-in in the middle or at the end of a meal, our table was visited several times and we were chatted with a little more than I'd like; there were 2 occasions when our food was delivered to our table but I felt like I had to wait to begin eating because we were in a conversation with the manager. I understand that they are trying to make sure that everything is running smoothly, but when the food is that expensive I want to be able to enjoy it with the company I came with.  I plan on getting some of their Tuesday tacos to bring home after work in the future, and I'd probably sit at their bar again for dinner mid-week. Overall, if my biggest complaint is that I received too much service, then I think Graft is alright."}
{"text":"The chicken was one of the best meals I have had. Try the Brussels sprouts and the fennel salad too."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to eat in town! My husband and I love this restaurant. If you are going out for a date night, anniversary, or just need some good food this is the place. Since I live in Madison this is where we always celebrate special occasions, the menu is a little pricey but worth it because of the quality. They have a seasonal menu of local food but always have the amazing beef tartare- it's a must try!"}
{"text":"Rude service, dry meats, fishy salads. The mangers are very rude and are only serviceable if you appear to want to blow money on their over priced wines and small plates. Maybe Tory Miller was right, they don't use 100percent fresh and organic stuffs, they use cheap stuff when they need to. How's that for 30 bucks?"}
{"text":"All around great food (5/5) but the service really killed the experience for us.  Waited 2.5 hours for four small plates on a not very busy Wednesday dinner.  Food was very good but the wait staff continually told us the food was just a couple minutes away."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Madison! Favorite eats: Fried chèvre, Brussels sprouts, Mac and cheese, scallops, and quail. Favorite drink: profligate potation. Perfect date night, nice dinner out with friends, etc."}
{"text":"Traveling is going to murder my waistline. Finding unexpected Farm to Table delicousness is such a treat. Yes, I have to travel into downtown from Middleton where my hotel is surrounded by McChains and TGIFried places; but it is worth the trek for the crafted cuisine and engaging company you meet from Boston.  I started with an aperitif of TeqTonic - eh. Too non descript. The citrus is reversing and the splash of tequila grips the back of my throat but it does nothing to wake up my buds. Beef tartare - seared meaty hanger steak .... Oh so delicious. Great starter. Shrimp and grits - great flavor. Tart cheddar on the bottom. Ate mostly the shrimp and found the shavings of cheddar under the mushrooms. The grits are nice but not for me. Graft Mac & cheese- fluffy pillows of spätzle bathed in creamy Wisconsin love. Thank you Graft for the complimentary dish.  Chicken- amazingly fragrant. Skin chips nice and crispy. Dry meat. Bummer. Presentation is better then the execution.  Flourless chocolate cake - light fluffy  Pedro Ximenez San Emilio Sherry-wonderful complement to the chocolate. Compliments of the bartender.  I would definitely come back again to try more of the menu and stick to the beef and Mac & cheese with a splash of sherry to close out the meal."}
{"text":"Our relatives who live locally took us here- the Fried chèvre was delicious. The tuna was fantastic as well. I would be oh so happy if this restaurant came to TX! I've tried many small plate restaurants in Houston and nothing compares to this. They nailed it. Maybe I belong in the Midwest!"}
{"text":"Was in town for the night and decided on Tapas. Graft initially was chosen by the location, right across from the Capitol. The service was great, people were on top of filling waters and whatnot. We chose the chevre - amazing, get it! Beef tartar- also delicious. Pot pie - okay, a little bland probably wouldn't order again. &  pork belly - yum. Good atmosphere, liked the large booths. Would visit again if in the area, thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful Madison gem, I had a wonderful experience with my amazing friends the staff were friendly and funny and even the Chef delivered some of his too die for food to our table. The interior is unique and I loved the wine room design. We had Scallops, the Mac-N-Cheese, Chicken, Steak, and Pork Loin. The Bartender is an expert because the drinks that we had are the best especially the Long Island Iced Tea. This place is great for group parties, a private dinner for two. Kudos to the owners thank you for bringing your passion to provide top tier service and food to Madison. WOW"}
{"text":"Very good food, excellent cocktails (try the Absenthe makes the heart grow fonder).  Service is very efficient.  Reasonable prices for this upscale spot.  I will probably return."}
{"text":"From the atmosphere to the cuisine, this place is a gem. It truly does not get enough hype for how good it is, especially by comparison to Graze and other restaurants on the square. I had the mushroom pappardelle pasta, the roasted beets, tuna tartare, scallops, the crispy chicken thigh, and the bourbon profiteroles. They were all excellent, but my favorite was the crispy chicken thigh. The restaurant's design is urban chic, and the decor is modern and tasteful. The only issue I had while there was the noise level- our table was near the window and it was quite loud."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place to eat in Madison. Everything about it is absolutely spot on - starting from the almost hidden entrance and garden-green exterior to walking into the beautifully designed interior, every experience at Graft is a journey.    Upon being greeted at the front, the hostess offered to take my coat and umbrella to hang up before seating us at a table. Inside, there are two seating areas: tables near the front window, and majestic, cozy booths lining the bar going towards the back of the restaurant. The booths are half-circles and perfect for sharing dishes and being able to converse with friends. A+ design.  In addition, the service here is incredible. My waiter/waitresses have always been delightfully helpful, friendly, and kind and check up on the tables often to make sure everything is perfect. The three times I have visited, the owner has also personally come up to my table to check in on how our dining experience has been that day and gave suggestions on new menu items.  Beyond the wonderful service and ambiance, the food at Graft really is amazing. Focusing on Midwest ingredients and tapas-style dining, the dishes allow you to truly experience brilliant flavor and texture combinations while not over-stimulating your palate. Some individual menu reviews:  Bread Platter: PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND ORDER THIS. I think it's around $3 and so worth it - the bread is warm, wholesome, tasty, and comes with the smoothest butter. The first time I came was a honey based butter that really made the bread melt in your mouth and the second time was a whipped, saltier butter. Don't underestimate the name because sometimes, simplicity is magic.  Brussel Sprouts: Served with pumpkin seeds and balsamic glaze - Graft takes this dish and somehow eliminates the bitter taste of brussel sprouts but enhancing the best flavors and accomplishing the perfect texture.   Roasted Beets: So many beautiful colors and cut into bite-sized pieces.   Graft Mac & Cheese: A must-have. The best mac & cheese I've ever had - perfectly creamy, flavored, and topped with breadcrumbs to take you all the way to food heaven.  Oyster Po-Boy: Comes as an individual order and I was a little taken aback at first by the combination with the okra and hot sauce. It's small but tall and daunting to bite into but the outcome is so, so worth it.  Pork Belly: Average. Was a little over-cooked and too sweet for my taste.  Half Chicken: The only really disappointing dish I've had there. The chicken was pretty dry, the sauce was also pretty average with no outstanding flavors or textures. Also pretty pricy for just chicken although the portion size is larger than the others.  Chocolate Tart: Wowowow. Super rich chocolate, great crust. Kind of hard to eat though because it falls apart with a fork since the crust is pretty tough, but not sure if it's not proper dinner etiquette to eat it with your hands.  Vanilla Bean Semifreddo: Super sad this isn't on the menu anymore! Topped with candied almonds, blueberry compote, and lots of love. I never wanted it to end. I might have almost shed a tear eating this.  Pot de Creme: I'm getting emotional. I thought it would be too sweet, but I was so wrong and I couldn't have been more happy about that. Perfectly sweet, smooth, cold, and the perfect end to a perfect meal at Graft.  Tacos: EVERY TUESDAY. There's a featured taco every Tuesday that isn't on the menu (so make sure you ask your waiter about it!) and it's $9 for 3 tacos. I've had a Korean taco, a pulled pork taco, and I've heard only great things from other friends who have tried other ones. Always an explosion of amazing complimentary flavors with the taco flavor choices and the perfect packed taco for satisfaction, but maintaining your composure eating it.  I was probably dramatic with this entire review but it accurately describes my experience every time. Love the environment there, love their cleverly designed website, and everything about it. Thank you, Graft!"}
{"text":"We wanted to enjoy a more up-scale dinner together to round out our trip to Madison. As much as we love cheese, beer, and steak, a steakhouse just wasn't quite what we were looking for. Enter: Graft.  The space is modern and clean feeling. We were seated in a booth with a view of the bar and a peek at the open kitchen in the back. The waitstaff were helpful, but unobtrusive.  We started with signature cocktails (SNG for me and Profligate Potation for him) and ordered our small plates. Our waiter was able to answer questions for us and advised we order all of our plates at once so he could better plate out and time our meal. We ordered the fried chèvre, brussels sprouts, mac and cheese, oyster po-boy, tagliatelle, and beef tartare.  The fried chèvre was an upscale dining take on a fried cheese curd. The outer edges were lightly fried and the cheese became soft and melty. The tang of the cheese combined with the honey sesame glaze they're sitting in was delicious. Easily the tastiest part of the meal.  The beef tartare, brussels sprouts, and mac and cheese came out next. Neither of us had tried beef tartare before and were pleasantly surprised. The egg and bread crumbs provide a well-rounded flavor and texture contrast to the beef. Very tasty and glad we tried it, but I don't think tartare is going to become a staple of our diets. The brussels sprouts were tender and came in a balsamic glaze that gave a mild acidity to the fresh sprouts. The mac and cheese was creamy with a tangy edge to it.  Next was the po-boy and the pasta. The oyster po-boy is a single serving slider that we divided in half. The hot sauce that it's served with is a mix of two pepper sauces and pairs really well with the oyster without overpowering your palate with heat. This was the winner of the night when you omit fried cheese from the experience (because let's face it, fried cheese always wins). The pasta is made fresh in-house and was cooked perfectly. The sauce, peas, and shrimp created a light summer dish that would be enjoyable as a full sized plate.  We rounded out the night with dessert. We were hoping to get the deconstructed pound cake that was the evening's special, but they ran out a few customers before us. We elected for the pot de creme and were pleased we did. It was a light way to finish our experience.  Overall, we left feeling full and satisfied without being stuffed. The bill came in right around $100 after tip, making Graft a wonderful place for a date night that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"I would come back to visit Wisconsin just for this place alone. Amazing food. Just. Wow. Kudos to the chef. Great menu. The best cocktail I could have imagined. weak dessert game. Otherwise, definitely would come back next visit to Madison."}
{"text":"I would give them 10 stars if I could.  The meal preparation was perfect, the staff knowledgeable and friendly and the atmosphere was great.  Cannot remember the last time we had such a flavorful and innovative meal!  If you love food, you MUST go there.  The scallops were phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Mac and cheese spätzle!  A tartare to die for; Scallops that had Grandma Kvatch practically swooning, and a uber-competent bartender who knows his way around the classic drinks...  This is what you can expect at Graft, a swanky (for Madison) joint on the capitol square.    Though the menu is small, it's well thought out and has something for everyone, even the Frogette who doesn't eat fish.  The desserts are delicious, and the the continuous sound of shakers at the bar had this frog missing the mid-Atlantic during his month-long stay in Wisconsin's capital.  (I mean...who doesn't like beer? But every once in a while you need some gin...vodka...bourbon...whatever.)  An excellent meal and a great find."}
{"text":"Best food on our table, and we ordered a lot, was the Mac and cheese, short rib and the bread rolls. Everything else was good, but not great. Excellent service."}
{"text":"I hate leaving bad reviews especially for new cute places on the square but sadly the experience here really ruined it for us. food was ok - some dishes good, others only ok. i would have still chosen to come back but the service was HORRIBLE. it started out promising as the host/hostess were awesome. our server though spilled our drink every where. took forever to replace the water. gave us the wrong cocktails. then took forever to bring the right cocktails. never checked on us. the people being served by other waiters around us all got their food well before us despite us getting there first and ordering. it was a pretty bad experience for a restaurant that is supposed to be more upscale. on a more positive note, the cocktails were great and we will go back for those. in the end our busboy essentially was the one who served us and that worked out well but overall a frustrating experience. i hope they fire that waiter because he is ruining the good stuff this place has to offer."}
{"text":"It's a cool space. I loved the booths and the general aesthetic of the place. It's a fine place to hang out, but in terms of a memorable dinner, this missed the mark by a long shot. We had a number of small plates: the Brussels sprouts, mac & cheese, Japanese eggplant and shrimp & grits. The Brussels were good but not particularly innovative or inspiring (and why are they serving Brussels sprouts in July?). Everything else was subpar. The mac & cheese was watery and tasteless, the eggplant was fried in oil that wasn't hot enough so was terribly soggy and though I didn't try the shrimp & grits my dining companion didn't even finish it.    And why did the bartender have an accent at the beginning of the night but not at the end?"}
{"text":"We love the restaurant.  The food is fresh and the service is very attentive.  They do a wonderful job of staging the food from lighter to heavier dishes.  This is a must go to for special occasions and anniversaries."}
{"text":"Graft feels very under-rated for reasons I do not understand.   It is expensive by Madison standards, but loosen up--it's worth every penny.  The staff is extremely cordial and personable. The decor is immaculate, modern yet rustic. The wine list is out of control--probably 15 pages long with bottles upwards of $550. The cocktails are made expertly, thankfully by a barkeep who doesn't have an ironic mustache. The menu is quite abbreviated but that's the shtick.  My food: the beef tartare was flavorful and slightly seared, which seems like cheating but was memorable; the scallops were hands down the winners of the night with the perfect sear and beautiful plating; the pork belly was slightly chewy but worth overlooking given everything else.   Graft may not be revolutionizing the culinary scene with fusion concoctions and gastro-this-and-that, but honestly, it's nice to dine at a luxe restaurant that is simply high quality, top to bottom."}
{"text":"Great changing selection of small plates and tasty craft cocktails.  Try the Chèvre! Interior is industrial/elegant? decor. Tables in the back are cozy and those toward the front offer a lovely view of our beautiful capitol. Staff and service are consistently good. Feels like someone really cares at Graft."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried out Graft last weekend. Overall we liked it a lot!   I made a reservation for 8pm, but we didn't get seated until after 8:15pm. Not a huge problem. We were seated in a booth in the middle of a large party/event. It was pretty noisy. However, I don't think this is the norm, but it was pretty annoying and didn't make for a romantic date night. They gave us free dessert, so I left happy.   I highly recommend the 'Profligate Potation' cocktail. It was sooooo good! Made with balsamic reduction - yum! We ordered 3 dishes to start, then another, and then dessert. Mac and cheese was good (but can you mess up mac and cheese too much?) and the chicken thigh pot pie had excellent flavor. I thought the scallops were cooked well, but the flavor wasn't anything special - just good scallops on a plate. We loved loved loved LOVED the short rib. We will go back just for that (and a Profligate Potation). SO GOOD! The pumpkin cake special for dessert was good. The chocolate creme was good, but very rich.  What I love most about this restaurant is the concept of small plates. Our servers said it was fine to order a few things, see if we were still hungry, and keep ordering more until we were done. We shared, so I tasted a lot of food. Also, while Graft is a fancy restaurant, by ordering small plates as you go you don't over order food - and this is reflected in the bill. I think we paid about 100 with tip for 2 rounds of cocktails and essentially a 4-course meal.   My advice to the restaurant: amaze me with your scallops and make sure I get a table for the time that my reservation is.   We will be back! :)"}
{"text":"I only had one dinner in Madison and I am so glad it was here! As a solo diner (traveling for work), I wasn't sure that I would be warmly received. Some restaurants don't like when it's just one person taking up a table, but I felt so welcome! Everyone was so friendly and there was no rush or urgency to the dinner at all. I was seated at a cute table near the window - perfect for people watching.   I ordered the Brussels sprouts, tagliolini, and scallops. Wow, just, wow! All three dishes were prepared perfectly and absolutely delicious! The wine was also great and reasonably priced. The tagliolini was probably my favorite - housemade fresh pasta with parmesan and mushrooms. Divine.   The service was outstanding, like I mentioned above. My server was friendly and warm and even made a few suggestions once he knew I was visiting (like you couldn't tell from my Texas accent).   This place would be great for a group - you could share multiple small plates and still have room for dessert. Highly recommend for date night, girls night out, or just to treat yourself!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful! I've been to Graft once with a friend and came back last night with my boyfriend. We split four small plates, the bread service (small rolls are to die for), and a few glasses of wine for a pretty reasonable price! Our waitress gave good recommendations and every plate was better than the one before. We got the beef tartare, smoked trout rillette, brussels sprouts, and the pappardelle. I did feel that the bottles of wine were unusually overpriced-- most bottles were north of $40, but we got decent reds for $9 a glass. I'd recommend ordering by the glass since there wasn't much of a price difference buying the bottle, plus we each got what we wanted.  I'd think I'd go back again and again for the food alone, but the atmosphere was lovely as well. It wasn't too crowded on a Wednesday night and we sat by the window so we could look at the Capitol.  On my last trip to Graft, I sat at the bar-- less romantic, but still lively and energetic. It was a great experience."}
{"text":"We had an excellent meal at Graft this evening. It was perfect for dinner after a matinee showing of Carmen at the Madison Opera, due to its proximity to the Overture Center.   With four of us eating, we shared eight small plates and two desserts, and each was a delight. Highlights were the mussels with new potatoes and coconut milk; the amazing brussels sprouts with pumpkin seeds; the blueberry cheesecake; and the butterscotch pot de creme (although none of the other dishes disappointed).   My wife and I each had different wines by the glass and both hit the spot.   Oh, and we agree with the other reviewers: the bread plate is astounding, and much needed to mop up all the flavor from the other dishes (as the French do).  The service was friendly and professional. While I don't feel that every crumb needs to be wiped off between each meal, but that says more about me than the restaurant. We were made to feel relaxed, and pampered. Thank you."}
{"text":"1) The food was generally superb.  My wife and I both loved the bread, chevere, and thought the park belly was phenomenal.  I thought more of the brussel sprouts than she did.  She thought more of the tuna than I.  2) Drinks were great; awesome wine and whiskey selection.    3) Waiter was friendly, but terrible.  He spent so much time gabbing with guests that we frequently had extended waits.  He totally forgot my wife's wine and didn't even note when the server brought it.  Host was also very friendly."}
{"text":"Tiny portions, overpriced and a hovering waiter that was pretty creepy.  Not to mention he had a trainee shadow with him who couldn't seem to talk but still came over an interrupted our conversation every 30 seconds or so.  On the plus side, the brussels sprouts were quite delicious."}
{"text":"If you know of a better restaurant in Madison, please let me know. Ambiance, service, cocktails, entrees and desserts were all impressive. Graft is a beautiful restaurant worthy of fine dining, but unpretentious and welcoming. There were definitely a few suits and couture dresses, but I saw jeans and sweatshirts too.  We started with a couple cocktails and Beef Tartare. Right away I knew we were in for a special dining experience. Despite only having a few ingredients tartare is difficult to execute properly.   I won't bore you by detailing each item we devoured, but use my pics as a dining guide. The only item that didn't blow me away was the Half Chicken. I rarely order roasted chicken at restaurants, but this was touted as a signature dish. I found it lacking in flavor, but tender and juicy. Not bad, but I wouldn't reorder. We were so full by the time it came out we weren't too disappointed. It was still a solid dish.  If nothing else YOU MUST order the Blueberry-Lemon Ricotta Cheesecake!! This is easily the best cheesecake I've had and a top dessert ever. I'm not sure if it changes seasonally, but this particular combination can't be beat. Definitely experience Graft the next time you are in Madison. I will from now on. Every. Single. Time. .."}
{"text":"Second visit here. Pretentious!  The incessant table wiping and fawning just isn't for me. Place is lovely with bankettes  and a few tables along with a sizable bar in muted tones. Had a nice merlot with some mall plates. The bread here is divine--especially the tender and slightly spicy cloverleaf rolls. The apple salad was sized for two but rather bland and lacked crunch. Loved the cracker with the ceviche. I don't usually care for fish but was tasty. The fried chicken sandwich was crisp, well-seasoned and simple, served on a slightly sweet yeast roll. Especially liked the greens with the chicken and the accompanying hot sauce."}
{"text":"Great set up with wonderful food and the best service.   Tried almost everything and loved the combinations.  From the moment you walk in everyone does everything they can to take care of you."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and view of the Capital.  Cocktail were fantastic.   Food was good quality and done well.  Price is high however. I get it that it's a small plate restaurant however I've eaten at similar places with as good a food quality if not better with less cost. This is therefore my reason for only 4 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent farm to table restaurant in Madison! Loved the understated design and vibe.  The food was delicious especially the fried chevre and the half chicken.  The non-alcoholic drinks were outstanding especially the Ambrosia.  The caramel pot de creme was to die for.  Definitely a recommended night out in a great city!"}
{"text":"This was a fun restaurant. They have mostly small plates with a few larger entrees. We were with a larger group so we ordered several dishes and shared. The ribeye was good but had way too much fat. I know ribeye cuts have more fat, but ours had excessive chunks of fat that weren't trimmed away. The greens on top were bland and bitter.   The chicken entree was really good. The chicken thighs were tender and flavorful. The mashed potatoes and mushrooms were a perfect combination with the chicken.   We also tried the brussel sprouts and mac & cheese. The sprouts were delicious. The max & cheese was really good but I found the sauce to be too runny. I felt it should have been creamier.   The service was slow. It took about 20 minutes for us to get our drinks. They also forgot one of our dishes and we had to remind them. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. The ambiance is very trendy. I loved the decor and the character."}
{"text":"Why doesn't Yelp let you do half stars? I would actually rate this place as 3 1/2 stars.   Highlights of the meal: Crafted drinks- I got the gonzo Some of the plates- number 1 for me was the pappardelle. It was wonderfully delicate and exactly what I want when I want pasta. Seriously good! The dessert- simple, but satisfying. I like the chocolate mousse with butter cookies  The hostess- what a beautiful person. So sweet and just seemed genuine and inviting.   And now the bad stuff: The tuna tartare- it just didn't work. The crackers are ridiculously salty while the tuna is under salted. And I get it, it's supposed to be eaten together. But I subscribe more to the idea that every component should be seasoned well.  The waitress- while our hostess was warm the waitress was cold. Not terrible, but I felt like she hated us, and who wants to feel hated while they're eating profiteroles? The bathroom music- ok, nota deal breaker, but it was weird.   Overall I feel like this place is on to really good things. They obviously get flavors and are interested in trying to explore flavors subtly."}
{"text":"Our team comes out to Madison quite often and I am ofcourse I am in charge ( because the team trusts my taste) of booking places for dinner. I saw this place in YELP and decided to take the team to this place for dinner because of the good ratings of  Yelp reviews.  We were greeted at the door cordially and taken to our booth.  There are so many good things to share on the menu so we ordered the following: 1) mixed salad 2) Brussels sprouts 3) scallops 4) pork belly 5) half chicken 6) baked bread 7) short rib 8) Mac n cheese 9) lemon ricotta cheesecake 10) chocolate ganache cake 11) butterscotch pana cotta  12) bacon ice cream with pecan and praline banana 13) beef tartare 14) yellow tuna fun Everything was good BUT seems like flavors were lacking and not on point. I even asked sea salt to add on beef tartare and yellow tuna and when I added it, it tasted much better.  I have had better on all the dishes that were served  and there was no dish that stood out that would made me comeback to this place.  The bacon ice cream was interesting but I don't think it should be served alone and not together with the praline banana and pecans like a banana split ice cream treat.  The lemon cheesecake was good and so was the butterscotch dessert. Chocolate ganache cake was very dry which was disappointing.  Our server was really helpful and very attentive though which is a plus.  If I come back here, I would have to pass this place. TRUST!!!!"}
{"text":"The vibe is modern and upbeat.  The food is particular & fabulous.  The martinis are tasty.  The staff is gracious and attentive.  Staff took my coat and found a seat at the bar to order a martini. Had planned to eat dinner at the bar and then discovered that a table opened up due to a last minute reservation cancellation."}
{"text":"Only giving it a 4 because we didn't order any food but drinks and bartending service would be a 5 for sure.  I loved the ambiance, the space is was very nice and clean looking. I liked that it was big, it never felt too crowded, even on a Friday night. The bartender was very knowledgeable and they punch they had was delicious.  Food menu looks good and it's set up from small plates to large plates. As a group you would probably order several to share. I will definitely be back for drinks and food sometime in the future."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars!   Food - 5 Stars !  Me and husband went for dinner on Sunday 8:30pm and the place was pretty much empty with just a couple other guests dining.  Menu items we ordered -  1) Fried chèvre - My favorite part of the menu! - fried goat cheese - yummm!! it was not exactly fried as one might confuse it for a fritter with cheese in it. But this was all creamy goat cheese with a very delicate thin crispy coating, served with honey & cracked pepper sauce. Please do yourself a favour and order these!!   2) Mac and Cheese - Great flavours, the mac was thinner than regular mac and i liked it that way better. One tip (if you love mac & cheese) i would give is to order mac and cheese at the end of the meal (or skip it ) as it might fill you up really fast and you may end up wondering i have not tried the other plates. Happened with me hehe.   3) Yellowfin Tuna Tartare - Very fresh mini dices of tuna, paired with thin Julienne style apple. very tasty.   4) Pork Belly with grilled asparagus - Melt in your mouth tender, juicy, buttery cooked to perfection.   5) Chicken Liver Mousse with onion marmalade - I have had liver mousse before and this was by far the best mousse i have had, the onion marmalade tasted almost like the onion in our french onion soup, it was paired with mini dill pickle and crostini.   6) Quail with fig - 5 stars!! Please try this dish!! Loved it! Quail tasted like an enhanced flavour version of chicken. The size of the quail was tiny, around the size of 1 orange.   Service & Ambience  - 4 Stars !  Our server was the bartender who took our order and quickly after that got busy working behind the bar. This made us confused as who our server is and who do we call to take our order for the next round of plates. We kept looking for other servers who might be around and who can help us with our order. The food was served quickly. I hoped they would have changed our plates with new ones after finishing our courses. We had leftover sauce from dish 1 which got mixed with dish 2 and which got again mixed with dish 3 until we found the server and asked them to change the plates.   We got seated in the booth right in front of the bar, so there was a little noise for our private dining but nothing too bad, we had a great time and we will be going there soon!!  Parking -   There is a 1 hour parking right across the street, but since we went on Sunday evening the parking was not limited to 1 hour.    Overall a must place to try!! Food is great!"}
{"text":"Graft. Originally I was really hesitant about entering the restaurant two years ago. It looked expensive, kind of snobbish, or as my friends pit it \"east coasty.\"  But as soon as I walked in, wearing a hoodie and sandals, the receptionist greeted me with respect and gratitude! I was already impressed. Unfortunately they were busy so we had a one hour wait. We told them we'll come back.  I went to buy a few bottles of wine at square and retuned! Perfectly after one hour, and our table was ready.  We were greeted by Lucas, the owner of the restaurant, almost apologizing for making us wait. He asked to take a peak at the two bottles of wine I bought and he had nothing but good things to say.   Then, he came back with a bottle of something that he knew we would like, and let us try it. It was amazing. We proceeded to drink it, a little worried about the price but just put it off my mind during the course.  Ok, to the food. The food! It is fanatic. I cannot emphasize how much the food beats anywhere else in Madison. Not too greasy, not too salty, never over the top, small portions to share so we can all enjoy everything, and it's always changing. It's clear that only use the best of the best ingredients (WHITE TRUFFLES!!). I highly recommend one pasta dish (usually a ravioli or tagliatelle) and the hamachi crudo (or something else from the sea fresh). The patisserie is phenomenal. I really miss her pound cake!!! Pairing it with a chateau montelena rounds out the night.  All in all, food is just elegant. Reminds me of chef's from Japan. The wine pairings are obviously thought out with care by Lucas. But what really, REALLY impressed was the service!! Everyone is so friendly. Managers now know me by name (maybe because I'm the only one who keeps showing up looking like a bum) but they are always so excited to see me and it really makes me want to come call all the time!   Graft, I hope it's here for years to come!!! Great wine, great food, exceptional service :)"}
{"text":"Great food. I was going to sit outside, but the host recommended the bar if I was getting drinks. The bartender knew more about spirits than google. Well played. May have even left with a new gin to try again.   I got the ribeye. I wanted to go to a steak house but passed this restaurant last week. I figured by its menu I would have something a little more exciting than a traditional steakhouse. The ribeye cut and quality was on point. The steak was a little over cooked for med-rare, but it was still far better than most. The greens, blue cheese, and onions that came with the steak complimented well. My only retreat is trying it out and not living in Madison to go back on occasion.   Tip- if you like fine spirits or think you want to try something new. Go see my man at the bar. He will give you recommendations as based on what you like he can tell you why he thinks you will like the spirit he provides.   All said and done great eats, great drinks, great service and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"We will be going back soon. The view of the capital, the decor, atmosphere and service began our experience on a high note. The food completed the wonderful experience. Portions were a good size for a sharing plate and our tastebuds were doing a happy dance. Would high recommend Graft."}
{"text":"My wife and I agree with Samantha T's review. The food was far below average for a restaurant of this type. Our waitress never told us her name and never smiled once. The only upside was their floor manager who was very personable and tried his best to give us a good experience. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants here. The food is delicous, the environment and service are nice. Tonight we tried the 16oz ribeye with charred onion, watercress and balsamic, which is really juicy and yummy. Also we enjoyed the prokbelly, maccheese, chickenliver, brussels with pistachio, shrimp pasta with baby spinach and bean, chocolatetart and potdecreme.  Every dish is good. The waiters are friendly and professional. I enjoyed this night. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Cool vibes. They gave us free samples. Food was good, not excellent! I would def go back!"}
{"text":"Four stars for service, ambiance, mostly great food and great wine. Tl;dr: a couple dishes were a little salty, everything else was perfect.   This new restaurant is absolutely gorgeous from the moment you walk in - beautiful, lush fabrics and textures everywhere. The aesthetics alone are worth the visit...industrial mixed with luxury mixed with modern, it's just a visual treat.  The service was great; our server Mark was attentive and knowledgeable, a little over the top on the schtick factor but funny to us. He recommended some dishes right away and had our selections out so fast it was amazing. We chose a rum sangria punch, the Malbec and the Pinot Noir. All three were well balanced and reasonably priced.   One of the best things about this place is the way the menu is limited but perfectly set up for sharing. This isn't a place you go with one other person who doesn't like to sample lots of things; this is where you go with a group who wants to taste everything on the menu. There are only about 15 menu choices and the chef works hard on every single one. The small plates are so reasonably priced ($7-$10 each) that it's easy to order a bunch of them.   All told, we got the bread, fried chèvre, Brussels sprouts, cobia (fish), Mac and cheese, coffee rubbed flank steak, market bar dessert, and pumpkin doughnut dessert.   Bread service: great, fresh rolls and sourdough with honey butter. Delicious. Fried chèvre: save some bread to spread the chèvre on...mouthwatering. Brussels sprouts: the pumpkin seeds mixed in are the highlight, roasted and candied with this fabulous hint of cumin.  Cobia: I was skeptical because fish isn't always that special, but our server really pushed it and he was right. It was dense yet flaky with a perfect sear, almost meaty in its substance and with a fabulous parsnip side and sauce.  Mac and cheese: had the potential to be so great, but was too salty for our taste. We ate it but let the server know, so with the level of responsiveness we experienced, I wouldn't be surprised if they fix that soon.  Flank steak: the coffee butter was a fun touch and the steak was pretty good, but not out of this world. They can't all be home runs.  Desserts: arguably the best part of the meal. The market special was a cranberry apple crisp with homemade ice cream- the tartness of the cranberries was a perfect counterpoint to the sweetness of the ice cream. The mini pumpkin doughnut balls came with a coffee ice cream and bourbon caramel that knocked our socks off.   The ability to make a reservation was a nice touch, and I like this place for a fun ladies' night of luxury. I'm inly knocking off the fifth star for the general saltiness of the food, but since they're fairly new, I'd love to watch what they come up with next!"}
{"text":"Was so looking forward to this concept in Madison after wonderful experiences at similar styles eateries in New York, Chicago and Milwaukee...Sadly Graft was more of a Shaft! The decor, while cooly hip and chic relates in no way to anything remotely cuisine driven- well maybe the cobblestone floors and wood...the slick curved tile wall at the entrance reminds me of a Spa on a cruise ship and let's not even talk about the wasted anti chamber of sinks outside of the ill placed bathrooms and the ridiculous high gloss stripe painting...that said lets move on to the food. Uninspired fare, tiny portions served on cramped plates made it impossible to \"share\"-under seasoned, the same pasty beige cream sauce used on two different dishes one with added mustard and completely obliterated what might have been a decent pheasant dish- no creativity in plating and not a nod to the fact that it's summer and the freshest ingredients abound- maybe some of them could find their way onto a plate??? Fennel served three ways? Mushy (braised) seared (lacking any Caramelization) and the green fronds don't really count as a preparation. Oddly portioned for four to share- really? 3 pieces of fried chèvre? Up your servings to accommodate the number of diners-our (stepford) waitress pushed the amazing bread plate for $3 to \"sop up the delicious sauces with\" however there wasn't any sauce to be had on the plates! Tuna tartare was a tasteless chop of flesh and what I hoped would be jalapeños but instead turned out to be cucumber chunks- the same coarse chop was used for the smoked trout rielette- maybe a trip to a culinary dictionary to look up what tartare and rielette mean would help- we didn't bother with the steak tartare as we're afraid it would be more of the same. When we inquired about bottles of wine as the list only   featured wines by the glass we were told to simply multiply the cost of the glass by 5 to know the price!!! Are you kidding me? You boast a sommelier and don't list your wine bottle prices- apparently he carries around a calculator to do the math with! Never mind the fact that for most, wine by the bottle is usually priced better than by the glass. The dessert bragging \"our chef was Emeril La Gasse's pastry chef\" was another let down-a tasteless almond cake- not a drop of almond extract or an almond in sight, a ridiculously tart lemon \"pot au creme\" and an equally off blueberry granola mash left us wondering if he had been fired by Emerill- BAMM! Laughable double espresso served in a coffee mug- GET the RIGHT sized glasses and plates!! A Frangelico after dinner drink was grandly produced in a stemmed red burgundy glass-me thinks you all are in your 20's and a bit wet behind the ears. The true test was that after the meal not one photo of your culinary offerings graced our food porn laden telephones- we really wanted you to take your place next to the amazing grilled calamari and fresh ricotta bruschetta we had at \"Girl and the Goat\" in Chicago last week or the grilled octopus and rice noodle with cashews milwaukee's \"Odd Duck\" produced or the chicken liver manicotti from NYC's \"Prune\" ...go visit some chefs and restaurants that do it right before next months rent is due and you're wondering why you wasted all that prime real estate for amateur naive home cooks trying to compete for the next master chef title!"}
{"text":"Great friendly service great food. I will go back again . Mac and cheese, dinner rolls, Brussels sprouts, yellow tuna, pork belly, short ribs, whole bronzonio, dessert was pot de cream, panzella these were small portion plate but enough food for 4 people you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Another great first on the square!!   We try to always go somewhere new, and have yet to find a place that disappoints. Graft is no different!!  Everything we. Had, from the apps to the main course was excellent!!  Highly suggest you give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Realized I've never reviewed. Been here twice. It's the one more expensive place in Madison that I've consistently thought \"this would survive in a bigger city.\" Enjoy the space. On one occasion, had one of the most fun waiters I've ever had. Never had a mixed drink that wasn't amazing and interesting. A lot of variety in plates, vegetables in particularly have always been exceptional. We went to e'toile last night for a rare kid free night and left wishing we'd gone to graft."}
{"text":"Graft kicks ass...plain and simple!  Interiors are spot on with upscale finishes and just the right mix of cozy and open.  Service is impeccable which is necessary because they are serving some seriously amazing food here!  Wine list and craft cocktails are also outstanding...how often do you see a concoction with balsamic vinegar?!  Can't wait to go back...bonus that they take reservations!"}
{"text":"Amazing! I don't typically write reviews, but the dining experience and food were incredible."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious! The fried chevre, brussel sprouts, scallops, etc. Our waitress was super sweet too!"}
