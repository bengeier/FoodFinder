{"text":"Went here today for dinner. I ordered the seafood pasta. From where the seating area is you can see the kitchen, as well as the chef preparing meals. As I was watching I saw the chef open up a large bag of frozen seafood. I'm going to assume it was shrimp, the same shrimp that ended up in my plate!

The seafood dish consisted of a \"tomatoe sauce\" but looked more like red food colouring. The shrimp was also lukewarm and parts of my pasta was colder than others. The boyfriend ordered the rack of lamb in medium rare. It was okay but he expressed still feeling hungry. Not sure if he was just being a fatty or the portion size was too small. I was really excited to try out this restaurant and finally my boyfriend took me  today but unfortunately was let down. 

Overall, the staff was nice,  the ambiance was nice as well but the food was disappointing."}
{"text":"Had a rather pleasant lunch with my family here.  The food was good and pleased my usually picky mother. The serving size is smaller than of the restaurants nearby, meaning no leftovers but I left the the restaurant feeling plenty satisfied.  Their souffle was quite good (order it in advance as it takes 30 minutes to be made) and I can see my mom planning the next visit already."}
{"text":"I had dinner at this small and cozy place and  it was a very enjoyable experience with their friendly and professional service. They serve Western cuisine with some Hong Kong cuisine influence. Although their price range is higher than average within the area, but their food quality makes up for it! I also find that the dinner special is a very good deal! Will come try again next time!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is quiet for dinner. There was only 2 tables including us. It was a Japanese restaurant before which business was slow and expensive. They keep the open kitchen which is nice and main features as well, remove those Japanese decor and have it newly painted. 

The music was a bit loud. The microphone is over a table of 2. Wonder how the young couple talked to each other. 

We did not order the combo coz it was a bit expensive and we were not sure about the portion. Foie gras promotion is over. The appetizer is now over $17. 

There was a complimentary appetizer - salmon and deep-fried cheese. Not bad. However if the deep-fried cheese was hot, that was perfect for me. 

Lobster Soup tasted good and there was 2 pieces of lobster meat in the bottom. Sweet Potatoes Soup, the soup of the day, was out of my expectation with a hitch of spicy. Garlic bread was made before they served. Chef put them under the salamander to make sure they were crispy and hot!

For main course, we ordered crispy corn hen, scallop and foie gras. The corn hen was good and portion was big enough (half). The scallop was big and sweet. With the green apple and papaya Salad in yuzu sauce, it tasted even better. Foie gras was crispy outside and paired it with raisin toast and cranberry sauce. Personally, I thought cranberry sauce and toast were just perfect. 

They claimed they were \"wine, dine,dessert bar\". They had 4 homemade dessert last night. We tried 3 of them that was suggested by restaurant manager. Cheesecake was the best! It was rich in flavour and texture. It's small too! Not too much after dinner and satisfied my sweet tooth. Chocolate Souffl√© was a disappointment. It collapsed quite fast but the small spoonful ice cream with nuts was yummy. Chocolate Molten Cake was hot enough and not too sweet. 

Overall the service was attentive. There was only 5 customers. Food was okay but the price was a bit expensive.  Food presentation was fine. 

Will I come back? Not sure... But I will introduce to my friend and let's have a try."}
{"text":"They can do better.
The services wasn't bad. It's okay, but they should \"let me know\" or suggest me to add a glass of wine for $5 when I ordered the set dinner.
(They need to clean wine glasses with a cloth or something, not paper towel as it would leave some white dust...)

The menu is okay, one word to describe it is \"simple\".
May be too simple, as they didn't mention what cut of the steak is. ( or the \"Alberta steak\" is a type of cut that I didn't know?)

Soup of the day was mushroom soup. That's what I was told as I order.
Normally I wouldn't order mushroom soup as I always got canned mushroom soup at places when I was little. I hate the smell.
The mushroom soup they serve actually really good as they put truffle oil to the soup as they serve it.
(This is some thing they can let me know before I order, not to came back to me with this info when I am halfway through the soup)

The steak came in a retangular piece, the size of a sponge. Doesn't look like a \"natural cut\", it looks like a very well trimmed piece.
It comes with veggie and potato wedges.

The creme brulee was a fail. While it has a nice crack-able top, the custard was quite firm, i think it's overcooked and cooked too fast as a lot of air bubble were formed near the bottom part of the custard.

Overall, it's an okay place to eat. Would come back to it if it comes to mind, and in the mood for this type of food."}
{"text":"This little place was definitely a surprise! Had been by it quite a few times, but always forgot to drop by for lunch when I was actually around there. Like a little Italian bistro in a corner space, this Chinese run restaurant was quite authentic to European cuisine, without making dishes fusion, or Hong Kong style. Definitely won points there!

The space is quite small, with only about 5-6 tables, but the decor was very modern and similar to a cafe in Europe. With an open kitchen and wine for days, this is definitely a nice change of scenery compared to the other restaurants in the plaza. With jazz playing in the background, it creates a comfortable environment and vibe to sit and eat your lunch, and slow down your hectic day. 

With a simple lunch menu, with about 5 pastas and a couple of mains, it is definitely a nice array of choices without being overwhelming. We went for the Italian Sausage Pasta and tthe Beef Stew. Both were quite delicious, with good flavours coming through. Portions were rather small, but I assume that was because it was from the lunch menu. 

Service was quite good, as the restaurant is quite small. With 1-2 servers and 1 chef, everything is done small-scale, but works for them. 

They definitely had some dishes and desserts I may wanna try another time, so I guess I would come back some time! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Our experience at The Chef's Table was very good in terms of service. They went above and beyond for my sister's birthday and I don't think I could have asked for a more warm or welcoming evening. I wished they had the souffle but they had run out. The pasta we ordered with the sausage and mushroom was good...tip: mix it all together before you eat it as the sauce and warmness of the pasta will blend better. We also ordered the steak, which was fine - we enjoyed the pasta more. Its a very good place to catch up, have a glass of wine and dessert. You absolutely do not feel rushed once you walk into the establishment. I look forward to trying that chocolate souffle next time I go, which a friend had claimed it's the best she's had in Toronto! Pretty hard to not want to try it after hearing that :) call in advance to make sure they have it!"}
{"text":"This is more of Hong Kong's take on Western food. Its tastes are more catered to Asians and personally, I think I prefer this style since it's not as heavy as some of the real Italian restaurant food I've had. I had the seafood pasta and the beef pasta and they were both delicious. I did like the beef pasta more than the other but my cousin liked the seafood over beef. The portions are a bit small when you first look at it but by the end of the meal, you are actually full. I guess we're just so used to going to western restaurants where they give you overly huge portions that your perspective changes when you see a proper 1 person amount of food. All in all, I think this is a nice little place to have a casual lunch with friends."}
{"text":"Listening to light jazz and Frank Santra during lunch at The Chef's Table was quite relaxing. A break from the usual dining experience in and around Market Village.

Set Lunch: ($10.99)

Garlic Bread

House Salad with House Made Grapefruit Vingearette
- a good attempt but seems like trying to put too many elements that not total work together
- papaya, carmelized walnut all quite interesting
- bitterness, sourness, sweetness all in one

Curry Shrimp with Rice
- Think fusion: a little touch of light curry spice cooked with a dash of lemon and cream
- cooked when order as the shrimps were pan cooked in sauce when I finished eating my salad, a few of the shrimps were cold inside though
- Chinese broccoli as side veggie

Coffee

I love the concept of The Chef's Table. Though the choices are limited but at least you know everything is in season and freshly prepared.

Sadly for beer lovers, only Molson Canadian is available. 

I might be back for another lunch special. Even for dinner: Foie Gras App for $14?!

Service is polite and courteous. 

Cash Only."}
{"text":"The Chef's Table aims to be a high end Hong Kong style western bistro.  It reminds me of the restaurant inside Monte Carlo Inn on Woodbine Avenue, but it is a lot more  contemporary in both decor and food. 

The lunch specials are quite a bit more affordable than dinner.  The Pan Seared Fish Filet came with white rice and cooked vegetables ($8).  The 2 pieces of filets were quite thin and they were cooked just right.  The sauce tasted bold.  There was nothing special about the rice and vegetables. If anything, the one thing that stood out was how not oily and how plain the rice and vegetables were.  Not a hint of butter or salt.  It was obvious that this was intentional.  Whether you like this chef interpretation or not is up to you.

I was glad that I added $1 for coffee.  It was strong and bold. It erased my headache in 30 seconds.

Other than the sauce, I can cook this simple dish myself, easily, except I have to make sure the ingredients are just as fresh.

The service was outstanding: polite, crisp, classy without being pretentious.

Food: 3 stars. With service, top it to 4 stars on my book.  I look forward to trying its dinner."}
