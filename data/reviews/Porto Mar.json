{"text":"Went here for dinner tonight with my rents. Food was excellent! I ordered the red snapper, and the rents ordered steak. I highly recommend this place. Our server was knowledgeable and a joy/pleasant. It's a bit off the beaten path, yet within walking distance to the Intercontinental."}
{"text":"Received a recommendation from our hotel clerk for Porto Mar and decided to give it a go.  What  great food, liked it so much that we went back the next day for lunch.  For dinner I had the poisson du jour which was swordfish and it was delicious.  I have had it at other locations and it was overcooked, not here, nice and moist.  My wife had the Saumon Porto Mar and it was excellent. Some of the best we have ever eaten. That night we also had the Sardines Grilles and again for lunch the next day.  Certainly some of the best grilled sardines we have ever eaten. For lunch we also shared an order of the Crevettes Epicees, truly some great spicy shrimp and cooked just right.   When and if we ever get back to Montreal I think we will go back to Porto Mar.  Our server was Cynthia and she did an outstanding job."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner. Nice varied menu which leans towards seafood. Food was prepared well & pricing is pretty affordable for a classier restaurant. Service was accommodating & friendly. Decor was warm, cozy & surprisingly not packed (could of been because it was a deary, rainy day). Restaurant is not very large but good for a small to a mid-size gathering. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Porto Mar was a much-needed respite after a few nights of noisy, crowded restaurants and the quiet was the least of its pleasures. I thoroughly enjoyed my bachaulau (grilled salt cod) and it was nice to see a healthy serving of very tasty mixed greens alongside the roasted potatoes. My companion had the sardines to start and liver & onions in a raspberry sauce as his entree. He especially liked their house red, Capataz (which I have since tried to find in Toronto and online as a surprise but to no avail). For dessert, he had the apple cake, tasty enough but it didn't compare to the light and airy, dark chocolate, bubbly confection that is their mousse. Best ever.
The service was excellent. The very friendly but unobtrusive waiter seemed to constantly show up just before we knew we needed him."}
{"text":"Around the corner from the mass of restaurants and across from the water at 201 Place D Vouville you will find a wonderful place for a meal.  Hubby and went there for his birthday dinner on Friday night about 8pm.  It was not too busy, which was great since we could converse at a moderate level. 

As soon as we saw grilled squid and grilled sardines on the menu, we started to salivate.  We weren't disappointed. I was served four whole sardines, crisp, very fresh and just yummy. Hubby had two squid lightly charred, both dishes perfect. The dishes were accompanied with sauteed greens, potato, parsnip and carrot. For dessert I had two custard filled tarts. Not too sweet in a melt in your mouth crust. The service was excellent and we enjoyed talking with the owner. Bill was $50.13. 

This was one of the most enjoyable evenings we had in Montreal.  What a great city."}
{"text":"While recently in Montreal, I stumbled upon Porto Mar. We were on our way to another restaurant near Old Montreal when, from afar, we saw the comforting Portuguese flag. The menu had classic Portuguese favourites, steak and various fish dishes. The service was a bit slow, but it gave me time to talk to my girlfriend. The food came and it was good. It was what I expected. The portions, I would say, were a bit small. Traditionally I am accustomed to huge slabs of steak, however the portions here were smaller and more refined. I wasn't really happy, but at the same time I wasn't mad. The food was good.

Our waiter, and who I assumed to be the owner as well, was very friendly. He asked me where I was from in Portugal, and he later revealed to us that he was from the same region, and was from a nearby city. Small world. The end of the night was marked by desert and a somewhat pricey bill, however, I wasn't expecting something cheap, I wanted to treat myself and my girlfriend to a romantic meal in Old Montreal. For a full course meal with drinks, I guess the price was somewhat reasonable, plus we were family (kinda).

If you want good Portuguese food, in a romantic area, in a beautiful and warm restaurant, Porto Mar is the place to go. The service is good, the food is good, and your night will be too."}
{"text":"Oustanding Portuguese food at a good price.

The appetizer included chorizo sausage and a salad. The dinner was an excellent grilled half-chicken, and the chocolate mouse was some of the best I ever had. Oh, and the total, including a glass of port was $30 CAD. Can't beat that.

Surprisingly it was really quiet when I went in there, but that may have been because it was a Monday evening."}
{"text":"Thid restaurant is one you need to go out of your way for. Right now, due to construction and an archeological dig just outside its entrance,  tourists aren't dropping in. But the locals still do according to our waiter. He said the dig is expected to go on for another year.  Ignore the construction vehicles and drop on in. It's well worth it.  it's  a wonderful restaurant. 

The historic structure is beautiful.  The food is excellent. All three of us had the Portuguese  soup (kale, potatoes,  and sausage). I had the calamari, my husband had the cod special, and my son had the bruscetta du beouf espetata (Portuguese beef kabobs). For desert, they had a Portuguese apple tart ( too sweet for me, but they liked it) & a chocolate mouse. 

One of the most interesting parts of the evening was taking a walk to the restroom. You leave the restaurant,  go down a couple of steps and turn left. You head upstairs on a stone spiral staircase  built about 20 years ago that has the feeling of a Renaissance stone stairs in a European castle.  Very impressive. Wow!"}
{"text":"terrific evening. excellent service. I had the  grilled sardines, my wife the steak o'poive.Good selection of wine with dinner. I selected the restaurant from the excellent reviews. On YELP.I especially enjoyed meeting the owners."}
{"text":"Excellent Portuguese restaurant near the water.  Not very crowded when we were there on a weeknight, probably due to its off the beaten path location even though it's just a block from the busier restaurant streets.  Anyway, everything we had was delicious, especially the sardine starter and the seafood and rice main course, the latter being kind of a bouillabaisse with rice.

A nice respite from the more hectic and noisy restaurants that you can find plenty of in the restaurant district."}
{"text":"My wife and I were incredibly impressed. While other restaurants were packed and very noisy, Porto Mar was busy but not crowded and with a subdued noise level. I'd suggest it as an excellent choice for a dinner with conversation, a romantic dinner, and/or a gourmet dining experience. If you want to bump elbows with other diners and shout to have a conversation over a loud techno beat, don't go here!

We found the restaurant on a gluten-aware list and it worked out fine. They don't have a special menu but we were told the chef would take care and that we weren't alone. There was another table with the same request. In the end, there was absolutely no problem.

We did the table d'h√¥te or fixed price menu. My chorizo and salad starter was really good and a nice size if you wanted a small plate meal. I was thinking that you could have that, a couple glasses of wine and desert and be happy.

But ... We had salmon and swordfish (one of the two fish of the day). The swordfish was very good but we agreed that the salmon was probably the best we had every tasted. Incredible. We think it was cedar plank grilled but we're not sure. Really special.

We also judge restaurants by their ability to cook vegetables. Each of us had out of this world sugar snap peas, roasted red peppers, and a potato and onion dish. Just right in flavor and tenderness.

Desert - my rice pudding was OK with a little too much cinnamon but my wife's chocolate mousse was heavenly. Wow!

We had the house wine which was very good. Mine was a privately imported red in the new world style. If you don't care for that, they have a large wine list for bottles.

Nice people, nice atmosphere, and tremendous food. If it isn't clear by now, we highly recommend this old city restaurant for a lovely dinner."}
{"text":"We had a lovely meal at Porto Mar and would recommend it for a quiet meal.  All the other restaurants in the immediate area were packed on a Tuesday night, possibly because of live entertainment.  You could hear a piano player from a nearby establishment, but Porto Mar was tranquil.  Not so quiet that we were deterred from eating there, though.

Service was friendly and prompt.  We enquired about a children's menu since some other restaurants in the area had some form of menu for the kiddos, but there wasn't one here.  Still, they were sensitive to our need and helped steer us in menu choices.  We had their caldo verde to pacify the bug.  The traditional Portuguese soup was delicious- a pureed potato, kale, and garlic combo.  She ate at least half of the big crock of soup.  Hubby and I split the seafood grill since I wasn't in the mood for chorizo or any meat.  The kitchen does you the favour of halving the portion for you- no arguments over who had the bigger grilled sardine. ha ha.  The snap peas on our grilled platter were fabulous and the bug ate most of them.  She also hogged my brother's seafood and rice dish.  This dish is not like paella in that it is brothy.  He separated almost all the seafood out and gave her his generous portion of seafood infused rice/broth.  It was perfectly seasoned and delicious.

No room for dessert.  It was getting late and the 220 year old building was kind of freaking me out."}
{"text":"We went to Porto Mar for our last night in Montreal and it was excellent.  We had a chance to try a number of different things (we got the mixed seafood grill for two) and we liked everything.  Honestly, the sardines require skill to separate the meat from the bones and we weren't very good at that.  But really, you can't beat the food here and it's not the restaurant's fault that sardines are built the way they are.

The odd beauty of Porto Mar (at least if you're a customer) is that it never seems to be crowded.  This was true when we were there and it's also been true for many of the other reviewers, so take advantage of this.  Go when the old city is full of tourists.  Go when you're tired of the noise and the crowds.  Go early in your trip so you can go back again.  Can you tell I liked it?

There's apparently an architectural dig happening nearby.  There are signs that mention an old fire, there were ancient walls being unearthed, and it was interesting to walk around the area.  But back to the restaurant.  Go there and recommend it to other people, you'll look like a genius."}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant many times 
 It's a very relaxing beautiful place with friendly service 
 Food is typical Portuguese fare, quite good but not exceptional, reasonably priced 
Good and not expensive wine 
I'd say it's above average for what you get for your money"}
{"text":"First of all, this place has been hit pretty hard with all the construction going on Place d'Youville. Hopefully they'll have more clientele during the summer months.

I was contemplating on whether I give them a 3 or 4 *...because they really do a decent job on all of their dishes, but except for the escargots, I can't remember anything else that I've had here (sort of).

The sole reason I came back here, was because my mom wanted to have their escargots...unlike the usual French style ones, these are served in a reduced balsamic base sauce that is super tasty. We end up having to ask for more bread to dip in.

For mains I've tried fish of the day on both visits, stingray once and walleye the other. On both occasions the fish was fresh, lightly battered and pan fried."}
{"text":"My two colleagues and I went there tonight for supper.

The food was delicious and the service was excellent.

The house wine is very nice."}
{"text":"Very intimate and quiet atmosphere in a charming older building. All food was delicious and well prepared including escargot, Caldo Verde soup, codfish and monkfish Proven√ßal served with scalloped potatoes and grilled summer squash and broccoli. House wine was very nice and chocolate mousse was rich and smooth. All quite reasonably priced and with great service. We would recommend to others and certainly would return."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I happened upon Porto Mar one day and enjoyed a wonderful lunch.  The food was excellent, perfectly cooked and super fresh.  And the service was impeccable and professionally friendly.

This is a place that we will now visit whenever we are in Montreal, and shares a spot in our \"places to eat\" list with Toque and Garde Manger.  It really is that good!!!"}
