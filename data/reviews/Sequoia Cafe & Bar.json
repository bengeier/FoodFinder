{"text":"Terrible spot. The owner is the worst. We went on a Saturday night where there was enough empty tables and the guy refused to serve us because we wouldn't get 2 shisha. We told him well get other drinks but he literally walked away and said it's not worth it. The man clearly has no idea how to run a business. Unless you want a guy serving you that doesn't want you to be there. Don't go."}
{"text":"Out of all the shisha bars I've been to what I appreciated most here was that the volume of music here is at a respectable level. At this place it didn't feel like drake or Kendrick Lamar was screaming into my ear and I was actually able to have a decent conversation with my friends without any shouting over music.

The shisha was fine and the service was great, the negatives are that the owner did come off as a bit rude but it wasn't a huge deal, and the bathroom is pretty gross but I mean not much else you can expect from a Scarborough shisha bar. Overall I enjoyed this places atmosphere and would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I think the other guy who reviewed this may have either gone at a very bad time, or did something to anger the owner. I have been to sequoia many times and the owner is incredibly nice. His name is Magdy, and interacts with almost every customer. 

Ive only seen him kick people out on two occasions. Either the people who come in, are drunk, loud, and disruptive.... Or they are underage. Other than that, i've never seen him kick anyone out. 

Infact theres a group of people who are there all the time who sit and play poker, and only order 1 or 2 hookahs for a large group of them. 

On other notes, the food is good, well worth the price, the shisha is always fresh, and the location is great! Located right off warden and lawrence, there is a bus stop right infront of it. 

The only negatives i have to say about it, is the whole place could use a slight face lift, as it looks a bit dated. But the music is good, seating is plentyful, and the company is great. I highly recommend this place. Best shisha in toronto!
