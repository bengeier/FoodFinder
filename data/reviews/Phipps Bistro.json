{"text":"5 Stars. Not only was the food great, but the manager working today went above and beyond! I had been stuck in the airport for hours after storms caused massive travel delays. He let me purchase food even though we were closed and then offered me bottled water at no charge!  I saw him give another woman complimentary coffee. He was doing everything he could to help stranded travelers. I frequently fly through Charlotte and will always make it point to give this place business, they're truly wonderful!  

Note: I signed up for a yelp account just to give them kudos, that's how impressed I was."}
{"text":"The first time visiting this little airport cafe I was so impressed with the selection of pre made sandwiches. Fast and convenient and made with thoughtful ingredients... The sandwiches are from Something Classic in Uptown, which I love!  Unfortunately I chose poorly. I had \"the Goddess\" chicken salad with tarragon on wheat bread. I can not believe the amount of gristle and fat that was in this sandwich. So gross, I couldn't finish it.  My next visit to Terminal A, I decided to give it another try. This time I had the \"Pavarotti\". A spin on an Italian, capicola, ham, provolone on ciabatta. My mistake for not reading the entire description, it had an olive tempenade spread.  I hate olives. Even if I did like olives it was still not great. Maybe next time I will order a red velvet cheesecake brownie instead. How could you go wrong with that?"}

{"text":"Friendly service a plus.  Food is extra greasy however, so if you are repelled by fat then stay away.  Pricey too but you would expect that from an airport joint.

We had some fast eats before our flight.  Hot dog, soup, grilled chicken burger, onion rings, fries.  Good quality mostly, except for the hot dog which was sliced and cooked and way too slick and greasy for me.  Grilled chicken was a plus, served on a fresh roll.  Potato soup was solid also."}
{"text":"Very impressive for airport food. I am based in Charlotte but travel a lot. This is definately my \"go to\" place. Their breakfast sandwiches are freshly made, reasonably priced, large, and good! Their red velvet brownie shouldn't be missed."}
{"text":"Seven dollar breakfast sandwich which consist of hard sausage and over cooked eggs. Stay away gross !"}
