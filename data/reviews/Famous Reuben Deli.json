{"text":"Great local diner located in an old house.  The dining area is small and the place fills up quickly on the weekends for breakfast, but take out is an option.  Staff is friendly and attentive. The prices will take you back to the 60's.  6 of us had full breakfasts for under $40.  The homemade corned beef hash is the star here: shredded, flavorful meat nicely crisped. The special pairs the beef with 3 eggs, home fries (really, fried sliced potatoes), and toast.  You won't leave hungry.  Plenty of other breakfast choices, all nicely prepared.  If you like diner fare, you'll like this place."}
{"text":"This is our weekend breakfast take out spot. Great service and the breakfast is always fast and convenient. We've only dined in here occasionally; it has a smaller dining area but is a good local spot. The food has actually improved in the last few months. Previously, the hash browns didn't seem to be fresh but that's changed. Great basic fare."}
{"text":"This joint is under new management for the 4th time in as many years.

Our office staff picks up sandwiches on an occasional basis.  They are less than generous when compared to the more well known C-town deli's.

The staff is friendly, and prices are OK, but the food is somewhat inconsistent.

Maybe they can get Mike Holmgren on the payroll to get them pointed in the right direction."}
{"text":"The dining room has completely been redone. The seating looks great however a large tv has been placed on the wall. It was Saturday morning and RAMBO was blasting out of the speakers. The server stated that \"everyone is in the mood for rambo this morning\".  There were 5 diners.I was able to write three full reviews while I waited for my food. Cornbeef was chewy. Eggs underseasond and overcooked."}
{"text":"There aren't many breakfast options in the area, so we headed to Lode's Famous Reuben Deli with my brother. He loves greasy spoons, and this place was just that. It is located in a house that has been converted into a restaurant. When you walk in, you know that there are probably tons of regulars, and everybody knows your name. They have a decent sized menu at very affordable prices. 

I ordered the potato pancake special, which came with eggs, two potato pancakes, and a choice of bacon or sausage. It wasn't anything spectacular, but maybe it was because I didn't order a more classic breakfast. Three people at our table ordered the corn beef breakfast special, and it looked pretty good. My boyfriend said his French toast special was decent as well. The service was good, and our coffee was refilled more than once.

You definitely get what you pay for, so don't go expecting culinary genius or anything like that. If you're in the area looking for a greasy spoon, this is definitely your best bet."}
{"text":"Good local place. Staff is good. Inside could use an update, but the food is what it's about. I would suggest the corned beef hash special! A heaping amount of food! The corn beef hash is real cubed pieces of corn beef instead of some mush or lunch meat shavings. Sooo good! I heard the pancakes are also really good!"}
{"text":"Great small family restaurant 
Cheap menu and good food. I've had the corned beef for lunch and was good. But I go there on Sundays for breakfast and it's always good and quick. Service is ok could be better but it's a small family place so take the good with the bad 
But I'll continue to go there"}
