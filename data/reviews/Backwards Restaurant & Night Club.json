{"text":"My co-worker and I were on the hunt for a new lunch takeout spot. Despite the extremely quiet atmosphere (we were the only customers at 12 pm), we wandered into Backwards and were pleasantly surprised by the expertly executed, reasonably priced food. Correction -- the food is phenomenal. Our server (service from Amanda was friendly and helpful) told us the chef is from the late Downtownfood, former occupant of the space.   Where else in downtown Calgary can you get a grilled New York steak napped with from-scratch demi-glace (Amanda said, chef takes 4 days to make it), paired with confit potatoes and vegetables for $15? A fine lunch special on a dreary Monday. My co-worker's $12 nicoise salad (she substituted poached chicken for the menu's ahi tuna) was a generous portion that she enjoyed. Substitutions can be less than stellar because, well, that's not how the chef conceived the dish. No such problem here.   My second visit started off on a high note with the arrival of the soup that was part of a sandwich & soup combo. It was quite possibly the best New England-style clam chowder my friend and I ever had (we've had rather a large amount through the years). Chockful of clams, the chowder was complemented by tender chunks of perfectly cooked potatoes (not the soggy, mealy mess often encountered in sub-par chowders) in a briny, creamy base. The chowder was so good I was back later in the day for takeout for dinner.  A nice touch was -- without prompting -- our soup and sandwich combo had been split into two and both portions were presented beautifully on a platter. While we had informed our server we'd be sharing all the dishes ordered, we hadn't requested any special handling.  I had hoped for the braised beef short ribs but entr√©e items are available only at dinner so I asked if we could have the braised short rib off the tapas list, paired with a side of roasted vegetables. Service was from Paula this time, and just as friendly and obliging. What was delivered to our table exceeded our expectations -- a hefty short rib, gorgeously glossy, served atop a small amount of creamy polenta.  The sandwich partner to the chowder was crispy roast pork. Roast pork can be a challenge to get right -- cue this city's far too many lacklustre \"porchetta\" sandwiches. In the Backwards sandwich were slices of expertly roasted pork with slivers of (still-crispy!) crackling whose flavours were brought into focus by pickled vegetables and slightly spicy aioli. Another winner.  Dessert was white chocolate bread pudding in a whisky caramel sauce. Usually when something combines white chocolate with overpowering flavours such as caramel, all you taste is a muddle but not this bread pudding. We easily discerned the distinctive flavours of white chocolate and caramel.  There's much more to sample on the menu (they serve breakfast too) so I will definitely be back. Maybe even this week!"}

{"text":"Beautiful space, friendly staff, and great DJ on our Wednesday night visit. While we just had a couple pints of beer, their on-tap selection was small but pleasantly local (a bonus). Hopefully this bar picks up a bigger crowd of queer patrons so it can be successful in the long term. You can tell the owners invested significant time and effort in creating a welcoming space with a big nightclub vibe while retaining a patently Calgary feel.  As a dance club, it's good competition for Twisted Element, hopefully encouraging them both to strive hard and attract a larger overall group of LGBTQ+ customers to both bars. The Bunker and The BackLot will continue to hold the market for the welcoming, low-key queer pub."}
{"text":"I just needed to mention the extraordinary dinner I had at backwards the other day. It was my first time there and will not be my last. I had the Artic Char with a potatoes gratin. The skin was crispy on the fish and the combination of flavors was exactly what my palate  was asking for."}
{"text":"New nightclub that was pretty quiet for a Friday night.   Upon entry, the doorman stamped my white shirt sleeve with blue ink instead of my hand. His attitude was that it was my problem and didn't seem to care what he just did. The ink did not come off in the wash, and so my white shirt is ruined.   Accidents happen, but the doorman didn't seem to care. He looked pretty sketchy too. The servers seemed nice and the patrons seemed pretty friendly."}
{"text":"You know what's wrong with this club they don't warn you however amazing it's going to be. Like super friendly people very good food fantastic set up."}
{"text":"What a lovely little bar.  I was just in for drinks, but super friendly staff, gorgeous space and you can tell they've worked hard to make it a very nice experience for the customers.  They've put a lot of thought into the experience for the patron and paid a lot of attention to detail.  I have heard great things about the food and really hope to get to have a meal there soon."}
