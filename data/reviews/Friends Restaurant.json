{"text":"Had high hopes for this restaurant. Service was slow- it took them a long time to acknowledge us to get seated, then took another lengthy wait to get menus, then drinks, and then to order. It didn't look like they have enough staff.  After the food arrived, we said something tasted bad they spent a long time arguing about it saying it tasted fine to them. I wish they had just said, sure, we will make you a new dish. Instead of arguing or trying to explain anything away.    The most disappointing thing happened when I asked to speak to a manager. We were told that she was too busy to speak to us. WHAT?! Not even for two minutes? That's the epitome of bad service.The place is Korean-run and has an entire Korean staff and maybe it's a cultural thing we don't understand? To their credit, after much insisting, someone eventually came out to talk to us.    In any case, it's too bad the servers aren't trained to treat customers well (or it doesn't come across as good) as the food that we did have wasn't bad and was well-priced."}
{"text":"Great space. Definitely friendly and efficient staff. Food came out quickly, more than enough to satisfy your hunger and was tasty for the most part.  I love corned beef hash and that is typically my go to, so I ordered it. The eggs that came with my hash were done to perfection. Niw, the cirnwd beef ... I may be wrong but it looked and tasted like canned corned beef which is disappointing. The addition of sauteed vegetables was a plus but there was also the taste of ketchup which really threw me for a loop. I like ketchup but not on my corned beef.  Will I go back?  More than likely. Their menu is quite extensive and there were many things that I would like to try. Plus, I love being able to have a great breakfast for dinner."}
{"text":"This place is a victim of their success, at the moment. There were just not enough hands. The only bad review for this place complained about the manager not having time just for them, but I'm sure its because they were swarmed and not thinking straight. Food was excellent, felt properly full afterwards. I recommend anything with eggs benedict. Price was less than $10 per person. Great interior. I hope the owners and management hire more staff, and considering the area should be full of students, this should be manageable."}
{"text":"Super spacious, clean, nice interior! There were some romantic tunes playing in the background (jazz) which really added to the atmosphere. I say this because the power briefly went out for a few minutes and I suddenly realized how big of a difference the music made! If I were living in this area I would be here all the time. The quality of their whole wheat bread is amazing and perfectly toasted. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside!! They give lots of fresh fruits in their poached egg and cottage cheese special too.   I also wanted to point out that they had the best home fries I've tried anywhere!! Ask for them to be extra crispy.  Service is good, glasses were filled but could've been tweaked. I'm ok w/ it though, not a deal breaker. The plaza might be difficult to find parking in though."}
{"text":"If you want to spent next couple of days in bath room or wish to make alterations with maids or listening to deafening crappy music this is a very fit place for you !!  Contaminated buffet foods, dirty plates and cups, cold and dark place all together makes you an unforgettable the worst experience you've had ever !!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance. Maybe a bit too spacious for a breakfast/brunch place? Food is average. Fruits are very fresh. We ordered eggs benedict with back bacon. The bacon wasnt hot enough.. and didnt taste like bacon. Need more variety for eggs benedict.. i prefer Egg's Mart eggs benedict.. they have more options like smoked salmon and mexican flavor. Anyways, this place is huge and looks like they spent good amount of money on their interior. Their price is cheap too. If u are looking for an average food in a very cozy comfortable environment, try here!"}
{"text":"Terrible everything. Made me sick to my stomach. Rude, inattentive staff. Poorly cooked, terrible presentation, no class"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was 7 out of 10 staff friendliness  was 9 out of 10 food was a solid 8 out 10 one of the better places to have breakfast in Brampton."}
{"text":"The best breakfast food you could ever find!!! Small cozy restaurant. I love the staff here! Super friendly and they know everyone by their first name!"}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on Yelp. The restaurant was nicely decorated. It is really elegant, yet spacious and clean. The restaurant looks like those in Korean dramas. Waitresses and waiters are friendly and their services are excellent. Ordered a Florentine Egg Benedict with fresh fruits and Ham with a cup of latte.   Latte: The latte is delicious. The proportion of milk and coffee is well balanced. The taste of coffee just strong enough to touch your tastebud.  Benedict: it tastes so delicious. It is different from the Benedicts I have had at other chain restaurants. The hollandaise sauce is excellent!!  It is smooth and creamy. The flavour is unique and yet tasty. The ham blended well with the spinach and the eggs and hollandaise sauce. Usually ham is a bit salty but this is not the case. The taste is just right! The Benedict comes with a lot of fresh fruits, strawberries, bananas, honeydews, grapes, oranges, cantaloupe, and pineapple etc.   My breakfast is excellent! I have a good start on a Saturday morning. Surely will come again and will recommend this restaurant to my friends!"}
{"text":"Found this place using the yelp app while in brampton. Went there for a late lunch. The all day breakfast menu is well priced, and the food is good. I had the large breakfast with 3 eggs and several types of meats, and a coffee. The service was lacking, as was the interior.  I am only giving this place 4 stars dye to the service: when my coffee arrives, typically milk, sugar, etc should either arrive with it, or be on the table, and not take 10+ minutes to get to the table... That minor annoyance aside, I would return to this place again. Price is right, and so is the food."}
{"text":"First time here and absolutely loved the food! Good service and the pancakes were amaaaazing!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. They opened 1 month ago so not too busy except for lunch. Breakfast was prepared quickly and well done. It's worth a checking out. Free Wifi and easy listening music makes it a great spot to eat and catch up on a few emails."}
{"text":"I have went to this place many times, mainly because persian events were held there.. I will give 2 stars, first because the food tastes good. Not amazing, but good. And second for some of the poor older women who bust their ass working there, one which ive noticed is very polite and exhausted looking. Makes me sad.   Overall, its a risk for me to eat at this restaurant.. Why? Because I was sitting and eating one day, looked up and noticed a cockroach crawling up the wall beside me... Cockroaches + food dont mix.. Sorry. Thats gross, I dont want to know whats happening in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast place.  We went to cora first but the line was too long and upon a quick search on yelp, we decided to give this place a try.    It was nice trendy environment.  Service was good and friendly but can take some time to get their attention.   The portion was decent and price was fair.  Will return and definitely recommended."}
{"text":"I'm soooo very confused as to why this place has such good reviews, this is the worst breakfast restaurant I have ever been to..Ever. The prices are very high, they don't have very good specials, the actual restaurant looks very run down and most importantly the food is disgusting. I ordered blueberry pancakes, a tea, and sausage which costed me $15.25! The pancakes were the weirdest colour, they were soggy in the inside and completely burnt at the bottom. The sausage was not that very good either. By the time I realized how burnt the bottom of the second pancake was I completely over the meal and went to the front to explain how uneatable this $15 meal was. They apologized and offered to make new pancakes. Overall I will NEVER  come back to this restaurant and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"For a while I had driven by and been seriously intrigued by the name \"Friends\". It seems like such a nice name for a restaurant. Finally I decided to go and check it out. I walked in and waited for a staff to come and seat us. I waited almost 10 minutes. In that time I could see a huge restaurant half filled with dirty tables and only 3 people working to keep it going. We were finally sat at a table and given a menu. We watched the front door begin to line up and no one was attending to them. People who were in the restaurant before us still had menus at their tables and no one was attending to them either. 15 minutes passed by and still no one came to our table. We decided to leave and maybe one day come back to try the food. I feel bad for the service staff as there was only enough for a small group of people. Either they are under staffed or miss managed. Sad to see such a nicely named restaurant going to waste."}
{"text":"Every Thursday a buddy and I venture forth to try out new restaurants.  Last Thursday took us to Friends Restaurant. This is a dark, a bit dingy place that features a minimized Persian Buffet.  The buffet consisted of the following:  Salad and dressing Soup Stewed beef with beans and greens Kefte kebab persian style Saffron Rice And a different Saffron Rice Grilled skewered chicken breast pieces  and precious little else.  We each also had an ayran which is a yoghurt drink. They offered us the \"non-carboned\" one which was welcome relief!  Now to be honest it is \"dead\" cheap at $ 7.99 and I must admit pretty tasty. The owner(?)/manager(?) is attentive and brought us the necessary cutlery to enable us to eat.  I don't think they made money with us but we were only 2 or 4 people in a \"barn\" of a restaurant. It is not a place to take a date, and even my sweet wife might find it on the grotty side. But the taste overall was good. It was only a step in our weekly exploration."}
{"text":"Service was poor here. Certain things on the menu were not available. Seating is confusing, it's not clear whether you should order at the counter first or sit down and get a menu. The venue is not very nice, old walls, old furniture, computer printed signs/handwritten papers for menu options. When we asked for water it was lukewarm and they only gave half a cup. Some of the food was decent but my egg was underdone and raw underneath. Pancake was burnt underneath. Not likely to come back here."}
{"text":"Beautiful modern space that serves breakfast. Honestly, this place is better than Cora's in terms of price and environment. This Korean-run breakfast place is super trendy looking, has WiFi, and cheap breakfast food. Although there is not much variety in what they serve, the portions are HUGE. The home fries are nice and crispy, eggs perfectly cooked the way you want it, and overall, the dishes will definitely fill you up.   Staff is super friendly and puts in more-than-average effort to serving their customers. Will definitely be back. Its unfortunate the location is a little remote but well-worth going to if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Only good things to say. I have been here a few times. Food is very good and consistent. Never had issues with service being slow. This is your neighborhood straight forward breakfast place."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am a small person. I ordered a western omelette with rye toast. The presentation is very attractive. The taste was fine but a 3 egg omelette looked more like 1.5 egg, and the amount of ham in it seemed like 1 very thin shaving. The plates are long to make your meal look larger. Basically you are getting a tasty light snack and expect to be hungry in an hour. If you want to feel full, go to Wimpy's."}
{"text":"We stood by the door for 10 minutes waiting to be seated (several empty tables). Then we waited another 15 minutes sitting at the table for someone to take our order, at which point we just got up and left. During the time we waited, more people were piling in at the door and again, no hostess seated them. After seeing this, we realized how short staff they were and that we would not be getting any service so we left.  There were two waitresses for a restaurant that has the capacity of 90 people. They need two more waitresses and a hostess. One waitress was angry and stomping around because it was so busy and she had to clean the tables in addition to seat people. It was brutal today. We MIGHT try again... maybe but if we see they're short staffed again, we most likely won't stay for the bad service (or lack of service) that we would get. Wish I had a chance to try the food."}
{"text":"I was looking for some quick all day breakfast place on the way home ( close to hwy) didn't expect that much, just ordered traditional breakfast which was egg Benedict, waffles, omelet.  The food came out really quick ( there's only one chef)  and they were all super good.  Waffle was soft and tasty, egg Benedict was not so buttery or greasy just right enough to enjoy the smoothness fresh pea meal bacon, crunch English muffins , the potion is enough . Very friendly owner who works really hard .   I ll highly recommend to anybody who loves nice brunch.  Definitely I ll bring kids here again"}
{"text":"Our friends came here and recommend us to come to try their brunch menu.  We ordered the meat lover breakfast and egg Benedict with ham and home fries.  When we got there we saw waitresses were very busy serving customers but they totally forgot people who are waiting to be seated.  There were many empty tables while we are waiting.  I saw a couple left because they felt being ignore.  Until we waved the waitress multiple time and then she acknowledge to give us a seat.  The food came slow and I didn't find their breakfast as good as eggsmart.  The interior was nice and can be seated comfortably.  I don't know if I will come again though."}
{"text":"The staff was lovely, but we came on a day when their dishwasher was sick. This greatly impacted all aspects of the restaurant and no place should operate without one. They should have a contingency plan.  It took a long time to get looked after at every stage, forcing us to go up to the counter several times. It was also unbecoming to see piles of used plates behind the counter and the wait staff helping to plate the meals. They were very nice otherwise.  But what about the food? Well for the price I think it's fair. Our whole meal, which was corned beef hash, a two eggs and ham and a coffee was $16 with tax. The potatoes were frozen McCain style home fries, but again the price kinda justifies it. Eggs were cooked perfectly and the bread is very, very good.  But the hash? Disgusting. Maybe I misread it, maybe it said \"canned\" beef hash, because that is exactly what that was - that manzatin canned beef with jelly. Served cold its not the worst, but when you are expecting corned beef and it's cooked hot with onions and tomatoes, it achieves and new level of awful.  Please, please, please do not order the corned beef hash. Other plates from other guests also looked undercooked, and I saw guests not eat them, but again no dishwasher today.  Oh, and coffee's good too."}
{"text":"I have to admit this place grows on me every time I go. The menu has all the classics and then some. It has those real trucker style breakfast sandwiches that are loaded. One particular item I found fascinating was basically a eggs Benny, but with a 6oz burger steak instead of ham. If I had this closer to me I'd probably go every week.   The ambience isn't anything special, but it gives way to a bit of character.  The prices are really good. $12 for a steak and eggs + home fries + grilled mushroom & tomato. You can't complain.   I was thinking of Sky Way Jacks in Mississauga and how much I wish this is what it was.   They rock me a decent eggs Benny and after this visit I think I'll be going out of my way to make some trips to Brampton to try more on the menu. Until I can try more on the menu I'll have to leave it at 3 stars for now."}
{"text":"Came here Sunday at 9:30am not many people. Home fries not greasy, and I even got Grape jelly jam which is very rare to get. I would recommend this place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This is a friendly family owned restaurant. The service is great and the food is consistently good. All day breakfast! The Pemeal bacon is soo good. I just wish they had bigger portions"}
{"text":"First time eating here. The place is a cozy, round the corner, all day breakfast joint. Prices are decent and there are a lot of options to choose from. Aside from the regular breakfast items they do offer specials for the day.   I chose the first special for the day: Bibimbap. Now that dish is usually mainly a big mixture of different ingredients (and i think it can be served either hot or cold) . Maybe I got used to the hot stone bowl, or the food actually being hot, but I wasn't feeling it that much. Don't get me wrong, it is tasty and it is a big portion. I guess it is just my preference of wanting the food hot.  The next dish I tried was the cinnamon raison french toast + English Toffee. The French toast was also ok, I think I got 6 small slices of bread (cut in half). I didn't taste a lot of cinnamon in it but it was decent nonetheless. The English toffee on the hand is delicious! I would come here on a cold lazy day and just watch the snowfall/read a book and drink that english toffee.  Service wise, ordering has to be at the counter and they will bring your food to you. The staff is very friendly and I kind of wonder if it is a Family Business.   The venue is your basic breakfast type. you have chairs, tables, and i think 2 booths (for reservation). If you are a large group i think they can rearrange the tables to fit the group.   Definitely will come back here and will for sure try their breakfast items."}
{"text":"This breakfast place recently opened up near my area. I was looking forward to trying it out after reading many great reviews on it. It definitely didn't disappoint when I tried it for the first time myself. The staff was very friendly and polite. The modern decor really brought the place together, it's a very cute breakfast/brunch place to hang out with friends/family and very decently priced. The food was really good compared to other nearby breakfast places. I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and looking for an all-day breakfast place to have a late brunch.   This place was awesome! It is bright, clean and spacious inside, with an industrial look. Service was super friendly and very attentive. Food came very quickly. Prices were *extremely* reasonable (about $67 for five of us, including full meal + beverage) and the quality of the food was very good, especially for this price point! If we'd found this place earlier in our trip, we definitely would have come more than once. I asked them if they would consider opening a location in Vancouver :)  If you're looking for a cheery place to enjoy a generous breakfast, without breaking the bank, I highly recommend Friends Restaurant. We will definitely be back next time we are in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This place is owned by a Korean family and it has that family warmth in the service which I loved. They have huge portions and delicious omelets. I ordered the meat lovers and my cousin had their special omelet, both were really good. The ham and sausages in the meat lovers were phenomenal. Overall a place worth visiting if you are around this area."}
{"text":"Great for breakfast. Kind and friendly service. I go a few times a week in the mornings before work."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this restaurant after our Sunday workout at Goodlife Bramalea, it's a 3 minute drive away. It's a small, cozy place with a relaxed vibe and friendly staff. It's hard to spot from the road, as its tucked in the corner of a place but look for the \"coffee\" sign. The music is mellow and perfect for having brunch with friends or bringing a book.    We get the $5.49 two egg, home fries, toast and tomato. It's never greasy, and a good sized meal for the price. You order and pay before sitting down, so there's no pressure from the staff. The coffee is also worth ordering, and I have tried my share of subpar coffee.   Next time you are in Brampton and looking for brunch, this is a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Ordered the pancakes and sausages for dish one, and eggs Bene with home fries.  The home fries came out light and flavourful, with just the right touch of crunchy on the outside.  It was a pretty busy place when we went. The food came out at a good pace."}
