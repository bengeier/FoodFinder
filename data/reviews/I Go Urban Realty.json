{"text":"Very glad this business is listed on Yelp!

I rented a condo that he owned from 2008-2009. He didn't solve an AC issue, and when I moved out, he claimed I broke it. 

He also said that he wouldn't return my security deposit because \"there is no bread left in the basket\". He was going to this property go into foreclosure if I didn't renew the lease, and I received $0 of my security deposit back (we also did the walk through together!).

Looking at the other reviews on here, I am not alone in my experience.

Shady, unethical, selfish. STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Jeff leased a place to someone else while we were negotiating terms (we were first in line and and he had taken our money). Slow to answer questions, late to appointments, not very knowledgeable about the units he showed us."}
{"text":"Showed up for our appointment 10 minutes late. Only reason we stuck around was because we (my girlfriend and I) had to call him to see if he was going to show up. He came dressed in shorts and regular t-shirt and very unprepared. We had scheduled three viewings which he said would be fine. He only showed us two because the other place was not ready to view. He did not seem to know what he was talking about when we asked him simple questions that a realtor should know. 

At the end of the meeting he mentioned a couple other places that may be of our liking. Said he would email pictures, prices, etc. We have received nothing from him. 

I suggest finding some other real estate business that conducts themselves in a more professional manner."}
{"text":"Jeff Devorkin is the scum of the earth. My experience with him as a human being was probably the worst I've ever dealt with in my 32 years on this planet. He deserves whatever is coming to him in this life or the next. You've been warned..."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a 0! PLEASE DONT RENT FROM THIS GUY! He is a CROOK and I have called the Board in him! I don't know why he still is in business. He will lease to you and find ways to keep your money as free you leave because he has spent it! Karma is coming his way!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible!!! Do not use this guy!! Find another way to view property!!! NEVER showed up for our appointment and then said he didn't have my number and yet it was on his IPhone which he told me he had. He sari he had important things going on...like I didn't!"}
{"text":"I used Jeff to find an awesome condo at Summit at Copper Square. Jeff was efficient and made the process pretty easy. I did notice that like most realtors, punctuality was not 100%. Jeff always kept me updated on an ETA and responds  to all communications immediately. I would recommend his services, I'm a happy high rise guy now!"}
{"text":"Very uncommunicative. I had to schedule viewings around his schedule, though I'm the customer. Drove across town to one viewing only to get an email (not a text or phone call!) from him saying that it was bad time. 
Went completely MIA once I told him my budget. I don't have a low budget by any means, but I suspect he's looking for rich clientele only."}
{"text":"Jeff was absolutely amazing. He worked hard for me from the minute I got into town. He was able to get me a pocket listing in the mark for a great price!!! I highly recommend Jeff. He has great knowledge of the area is a great resource."}
{"text":"Unprofessional and less than honest...stay away!"}
{"text":"I consulted Jeff regarding a property on 10th street and Maryland.  The rental price was above what is reasonable for this property, but I was willing to pay because I love the area.  Without even meeting me, or consulting the homeowners to see if they would be ok with this decision, Jeff declined my interest because I am an attorney, stating that, \"attorneys are major pain in the asses for no reason.\"  I have a feeling Jeff's lack of professionalism is the reason his tenants are, a \"pain in the ass.\"  I would not rent from this guy and I certainly would not trust him to find a tenant for my rental property."}
