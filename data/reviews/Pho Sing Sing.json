{"text":"All of the food I ordered here are good. I'm giving 4 stars for that and I would have given 5 if the customer service is better. Didn't give me water unless I asked for it, the first time I ate here."}
{"text":"This is the best place to get fresh fruit smoothies that are made with whole fruit.  The pho here is made with a delicious broth which is flavorful and delicious.  The restaurant is clean and the ladies here are friendly. This restaurant is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that my boyfriend is an amazing cook, which makes us both extremely particular about where we go out to eat - why go out to a restaurant if we can eat waaaay better for less money at home?  The one type of food that he can't cook is Vietnamese food, which we LOVE.  So, we researched Vietnamese restaurants online for an hour and finally decided to try Pho Sing Sing.    We were pleased from the moment we walked in.  The ambiance is clean, bright, and modern.  The service was so friendly and prompt.  Best of all, of course, the food was delicious!  We ordered two entrees and a soup to share and with tip, we spent a total of $32.00, which for the portion size and quality of the food, we felt was a really good price!   We went back a week later and ordered spring rolls, a different soup and the same entrees, and everything was still really great! We will be going again!   Some things to note when you go:   - The menu is somewhat limited, which is fine - better to do a few things really well than a bunch of things not so great.  We talked with the owner to see if they are going to expand their menu and she said that they do have daily specials that they are trying out to see which ones are the most successful and then they might add those on to the menu as well.   - CASH ONLY - they only accept cash.    Overall, a really great place and as locals, we are really hopeful that Pho Sing Sing will stay in business!"}
{"text":"This place was great..awesome food, awesome service, TO DIE FOR watermelon smoothie..Will DEFINITELY return"}
{"text":"Canh chua ca and ca' kho to...so good. ..love this place...bun man is good too...bun cha ha noi....yummy. ..yummy"}
{"text":"So good!!!! Great service. I asked for white meat pho and they made it for me even though it wasn't on the menu. Great food and great service."}
{"text":"I really like the food here, but unless the owner of the restaurant is here, you get really bad service. Once we get our food that's when the service ends... We even have to walk to get our check, not drink refills or anything...."}
{"text":"The pho was amazing as well as the fried shrimp and pork egg rolls. They come with lettuce, cucumber, mint and basil to make a wrap. Yum! The brisket in the pho was very tender and the broth had great flavor. This is family owned/run and the service is good and friendly."}
{"text":"Our family came here for dinner. Food was good in comparison to other Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas. Not happy to see when the bills came out was not same price listed on the menu. Everything was like $1-2 different than what it said on menu. Hopefully next time it won't be happening again."}
{"text":"Surprisingly the flavor for the broth is great for a bowl of pho . Most places is pretty bland ... They have great customer service . Food came out fast . No complaints . Great place to enjoy a bowl of pho ."}
{"text":"FOODIES, if you want the best Bun Curry, Pho, and Ca Canh Chua (VNese sour/sweet fish soup), and fresh vegetarian dish, you should check this place out.  I came to Vegas last week for a convention and came here for our team's dinner which was arranged by our team leader.   Needless to say, our leader is a VNese foodie who knows how to COOK very well, so I trust her taste and went along to have my dinner at this restaurant in this Asian Food strip.  Bottom line is the whole team (made up of multicultural group) loved the food.  My daughter was crazy for the Bun Curry (Fish Curry with rice noodle) while my hubby devoured the ca canh chua.   While I inhaled the egg rolls, I also vacuumed the vegetarian dish down my tummy.  Our friends (VNese and Indian) were equally enthusiastic about the food and cleaned their bowls if Fish Curry.    The fish curry was delicious with just the right touch of potato, fish, curry, and sweetness while you eat it with the noodle/bun.     The Ca Canh Chua was Sooooo YUMMMMY. It was light, sour, and had enough fish and freshly cooked tomatoes, tomatoes, and some other Vnese vegetables that I don't know how to pronounce or write :(  Hubby ate it with rice but I ate it with Bun/rice noodle and it was most delicious.  Oh how I love thee Ca Canh Chua.    As I write this, my daughter hovers over my description and reminds me to tell everyone to order the FIsh curry with Noodle :)  IT IS THE BEST THAT SHE HAS EVER EATEN!!  She is VERY PICKY when it comes to curry because we have the BEST in San Jose and Santa Clara.  Sorry Aunties, Pho Sing Sing won on the Fish Curry.  Too bad that I have to find it in LAS VEGAS!!!!!!!!!   :(  I have not visited the Asian trip at my last trip to Vegas (5 yrs ago) so I cannot say anything before.  I was SHOCKED to see SOOOO MANY Chinese, Thai, Korean, Vietnamese, ...ese restaurants.  Had my leader not found this restaurant, I would not able to discern which restaurants to try.      On a side note:  I always take time to talk to the owners or waitresses whenever I love their food.   IF you find that the food is da bomb, take the time and let them know how much you appreciate their craft.    I find that most often, they are harried or trying to multitask that made them ignore you.   When I go to Asian restaurants (unfortunately), I have low expectations of any eye contacts or service :) hehhehhe.    I am lucky, however, that most owners love to talk to me and hear my unsolicited opinions :)"}
{"text":"Too bad I couldn't give this a zero star.  I ordered pho with rare beef, and the soup wasn't hot enough to cook the beef.  The flavor is off, way too much cinnamon.   Service was horrible,  we had to get up to get our own highchair and it was so dirty.  We came here due to high rating, but was so disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is pretty close to what you'd find in Orange County where there's a plethora of pho places.  The taste is very similar and they aren't stingy with their most whatsoever.  Definitely did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese place to eat in Las Vegas, you must try it for yourself."}
{"text":"This is definitely good eats!!!  Best Bun Bo Hue I had compared to other bland one like Hue Thai & some other Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas.  I tried mocha with grass jelly per owner' s recommendation and I loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Best pho in town! authentic Bac pho.  You can def. taste the spices that most pho should have but don't have.  Food portion is really large.  They don't carry diff. sizes.  Chicken wings are amazing as well.  Almond Coconut smoothie is good after a long night :)"}
{"text":"If you like Vietnamese food, try this one. The banh canh  cua is so good, and the service is excellent! We definitely will come back again and again!"}
{"text":"Best customer service here. She took the time to explain the menu to me and everything. Best part was that I wanted to take a drink to go and she asked if I had ice at home/when I planned on drinking it because she didn't want my drink to get diluted too much. She ended up giving me a separate container of shaved ice bc I just moved in with questionable ice supply. Food was delicious, I had pho. Soup had great flavor, will be back."}
{"text":"I had to stop at 168 market to get some things and decided to stop and try this place since its fairly new. Very small and family owned, clean, and everyone was friendly, and I'm sure the owners wife waited on everyone, very nice lady. My soup came out hot, and in a timely manner, I wasn't disappointed! I would definitely come back! They also sell boba drinks here as well, a plus in my book!!"}
{"text":"Foods taste excellent especially the broth. I will definitely come back again next time when i come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Came across this lovely restaurant using Yelp and I must say its one of thee best Vietnamese Pho place I've been to. Food was delicious, restaurant was clean, staff was super courteous and friendly. Oh by the way, their water tasted refreshing unlike many restaurant tap waters."}
{"text":"Over priced. Small portions. Mediocre taste. Subpar service. Wouldn't visit again. I don't understand what the rave is about this place. Don't be fooled by the high praise like I was."}
{"text":"Great spot. Pho Sing Sing's got it. If you have a car or want to pay for a cab, go for it.  We rolled in right at 10am, and it was empty.  Service was fantastic and they let us hang out for as long as we wanted.   The pho broth is solid, and so is the summer roll.  I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place since my last Vietnamese food was back in Hawaii. My #30 Com Tam Bi Thit Nuong Cha was really good but I got hooked with their mango smoothie. The server said it was natural product not any powdered mixed and so it was, kinda addicting. I will go back for more with their smoothies."}
{"text":"Decent pho to be found here. Not the best in town, but worth adding to the pho rotation. (Photation?)  They seem to be a little skimpier on the ingredients than other places, but maybe it's just me. Their beef tendons have never been undercooked, though, which is all too common. The pho broth is tasty.  The bun bo hue was tasty enough, but I was surprised to discover it contained neither pig's feet nor a blood cube. Stick to the pho.  They do boba tea and smoothies, too. The boba green tea is good, but I got a smoothie once and it was so sweet I couldn't even finish it. I swear I could feel all the sugar crunching between my teeth."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  The Pho and Bun ga is some of the best I have had.  The Thai tea is so-so, I use Archi's as the barometer for that.  Service was good and the place was super clean.  This is my new go-to place for Vietnamese."}
{"text":"The sweet and sour soup is on point.  The fish hot pot on point.  The fresh squeezed orange juice on point.  I felt like a home cooked meal.  I thoroughly enjoyed the meal."}
{"text":"This review is soley aimed at the pho they serve here. I am far from a pho expert of any kind, but the pho broth here is really solid. I come from So Cal and I am quite familiar with SGV's Pho Avenue (Garvey Ave.) and a number of spots down in the OC Bolsa area, and this place's soup pair up with some of the good spots out there. I use to frequent the more popular 24/7 Vietnamese restaurant, but over the years the quality of their pho (their other menu items are still good) has gone down.   The flavor of the soup is really nice and I think they use a bit more star anise, so the soup has a nice mild spiced flavor at the end. The herbs they serve are pretty fresh too. I can eat a bowl of pho here without dumping any plum or sriracha sauce (IMO, the excess use of those sauces in the soup masks the quality of the broth).  As for the service, I can see why some people may complain about the service because of the language barrier. However, I can only speak on my numerous experiences there, and the staff here have been delightful. The mom is super nice and very considerate. I remember one time I took my friends here after a summer pool party and my friend was barfing outside in the parking lot. She came up to me and asked me if my friend was alright and came out with extra water and tea before we even sat down. She even ask my friend if he wanted to have less noodles and more soup (obviously, he needed a lot of fluids than solids :'D). This may not seem like a big deal, but she was being extremely considerate.  The restaurant itself is kept pretty clean. I judge an establishment a lot on their maintenance of their bathroom. In my opinion, if a company cares how comfortable and clean their bathrooms are, they really care about their customer/client's as well.   All in all, this is my go-to spot when I need some pho in my life and would recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Good food!  Friendly, efficient service!  What more can you ask for!   We had the Hu Tieu Nam Vang, Bun Mam, and an appetizer sampler, which was just enough for 3 people.  Yummy, too!  I didn't try it, but they have oxtail pho, fish noodle and a large variety of Boba Tea's.    Next time!"}
{"text":"Not great at all!! There were three of us and we each ordered a different dish. All of them did not taste like the minimal standard as they should. The poor waiter could not understand nor hear us correctly even we were very polite and nice about his slowness...I would not come back unless they change the cook!!!"}
{"text":"My fav pho spot in vegas !!! friendly although im not asian lol.  The stock itself is very delicious. You get your bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Im actually pretty new to the whole Vietnamese food thing, but I have found that this place tastes different than your regular 24hour pho place, in an amazing way. Im honestly not sure what it is, but the broth is on a different level. The wings are spicy, but oh so worth it. Jelly drinks are yummy. I will be back to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"I never written a review before but I must for this particular pho restaurant. We went there for lunch and when we first walked in the entire place was smokey (my eyes were burning!)!! The pho was salty and the egg rolls weren't good at all...no flavor! I had the BBH (spicy beef noodle soup) and it was ok. I thought this place would be good but it was a big disappointment! Service was decent. I saw the table next to us was complaining bc they saw that we got our drinks before they did and they were seated and ordered ahead of us! My husband refuse to come back ever and he's a easy eater!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious! The atmosphere is very comfortable and it's kid friendly. The staff/ owner is very friendly. i ordered their specialty pho and it was perfect. The broth was delicious. My kids had shrimp spring rolls and they were pleased. They also have some boba drinks!  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Favorite pho place in Vegas... hands down!!!! We have been eating their since they opened on spring mountain. Now that they moved to rainbow/Sahara we are still going there atleast once a week! The pho broth there is  my favorite by far! If you like spicy and I mean real spicy ... be sure to ask for the grounded Thai chilies!!! No one else serves it like that or even whole chilies sometimes in town."}
{"text":"We have eaten here 3 times after they moved the restaurant from jones and they still have Really good food. The  fried egg rolls look and tastes homemade and are really good. Also the spring rolls were fresh and delicious and so was the peanut sauce. The pho's I have ordered were delicious . And the Bún tht nng was very good. The pork was not fatty at all. The fish sauce is really good here also. The service is always good and they are really friendly here. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place! 2nd time here in one week and both times satisfied my cravings. First I tried the banh canh (#22), then I tried the bun bo hue (#28? I forget). Both of these soups were flavorful and delish! Haven't found a place better than Pho Sing Sing for these soups so I will def be back! Plus customer service is great (which is usually not apparent in most Asian restaurants)."}
{"text":"The best Pho soup we have had!!! People are very nice and friendly. Delicious fresh fruit smoothies. Awesome chicken wings!!!!!! Everybody who reads this must go to this place. Very delicious!!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had never tried Pho before so we decided to look up a pho restaurant with high ratings. This establishment popped up so we decided to give it a try. When you walk in, it's more a seat yourself type of place and the owner brought us menus. Most of the menu options came with pictures but absolutely nothing sounded appetizing; we didn't want to be rude so we said we would order drinks (boba and smoothie style drinks) so at least we patronized instead of just coming in, not getting anything and leaving. My friends both ordered Bobas and I wanted to order a strawberry smoothie. Before ordering, I asked the owner if she uses real strawberries in the smoothie or if it's a purée. She condescendingly responded, \"I only use real ingredients. Nothing artificial.\"Ok.. So I watch her make my smoothie with a strawberry purée that she pulled from the fridge and she throws in a couple ACTUAL strawberries. Lady, don't lie to my face and make me feel stupid for asking what's in your product.  The smoothie was sooo sweet from the artificial flavoring that it was unbearable to drink and after we paid I threw it out. If you're looking for a nice sugar rush, order any of their smoothies! Honesty is key and had I known there was going to be mashed up, sugary strawberries from a box put into my drink, I wouldn't have ordered it."}
{"text":"\"My mom makes the best pho\", my co-worker said. And he was not lying! This is their restaurant, and it is the best pho in Las Vegas right now. Try the seafood egg noodle soup or sing sing special pho. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What a great new Pho restaurant!!  Try their Pho soup! It's amazing and not loaded with salt.  You can taste all the amazing flavors in it.  One of a kind.  I'll be coming back for more and more!"}
{"text":"I came here after researching the yelp reviews. As I am on low carb diet, I asked for pho but without noodles, only meat and vegetables. This has never been a problem before, in California or in Vegas. The lady, who I assume was the owner, made a huge fuss about it, and wanted to charge me extra for it. Every other place, and I have been to a lot of Pho restaurants, has easily done pho without noodles, and given me extra veggies at no additional cost. After a lot of discussion, she agreed to get me the noodle-less soup. The broth was decent, a bit too much cinnamon for my taste. The meat was sparse, only veggies were onion and cilantro. Rest assured I shall not come back or recommend this place to anyone. And after years of reading Yelp reviews, I finally joined as a reviewer to debunk misleading glowing reviews and give props to places that actually deserve it!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time when in Vegas. It was a bit far from the strip but it was in a large lot with plenty of parking. The staff is nice and attentive. Their quality of ingredients was better than others places and the serving size was pretty big. It was around $9 for pho and vermicelli, which was a bit more than I expected for far off the strip pho place. However, I felt the price was justified, as I got more brisket and meatballs in my pho than many other places I've been to. There were some egg rolls with pork vermicelli and those were wrapped in rice paper. I personally like the thinner wrappers myself but that's just a personal preference. Pho broth was flavorful. If the was closer to the strip, I'd probably go back but otherwise, didn't think it was worth the longer drive out there."}
{"text":"Pho Sing Sing is very good.  The Banh Canh is especially superb.  The owner / chef is so friendly and sweet."}
{"text":"Tried this phi restaurant for the 1st time yesterday & I sure will be back. We ordered the pho combination, the soup was so flavorful and the meat was cooked to perfection almost like butter melting in my mouth. My son also ordered their freshly squeezed orange juice and wow! Best orange juice I've ever tasted. My toddler enjoyed it very much. I am also a huge fun if their peanut sauce for the spring rolls. It was so good, didn't taste like any other bland peanut sauce from different pho restaurant. Great customer service too. Thanks, we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Today, I am really happy when find out an exactly Vietnamese cuisine restaurant. I see their food made by their love for cooking. Their food tastes so good, clean, and fresh. I love Vietnamese food more and more. Especially, they have so many special unique Vietnamese food I haven't known before. Thank you for your friendly service! For me, Pho Sing Sing is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Replaced an old pho restaurant that was a favorite for a lot of viet families..   Came here on X'mas day for lunch. Pretty busy. Lots of canto people, surprisingly.   Service was quick. Food came out fairly quick. Tea is given in a pot, like a normal chinese restaurant. A lot of viet places tend to give tea in a tall plastic cup.   I had ordered the combination pho. Broth was normal? Nothing too msg filled or flavorless. Fairly good amount of toppings and meat. Think more tendon is given here compared to other pho restaurants.   Not a bad place. Would like to try their other stuff one day."}
{"text":"Amazing little cafe. Very friendly staff. And my very favorite #20 on the menue. Loved it for years..."}
{"text":"My first visit after their new location. Needless to say, food was still very good and service was still very friendly. The price is a bit steep, but the quality of food is excellent. Definitely must try their Spicy Satay Beef Noodle, so delicious! Their egg rolls are yummy as well."}
{"text":"Poor food, poor service. Waited a long time for a rice plate  to arrive and the Pho came without bean sprout/mint/lime side. To make the experience worst, this restaurant charged for hot tea. Dined at numerous Vietnamese restaurants in the past, never charged for a cup of hot tea. Ridiculous! Wouldn't come here again!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few Pho places around town. This place didn't let me down. Great portion size. Very yummy and well priced. Lot of families come and eat here so you know it's homemade approved. Two thumbs up for this yelper"}
{"text":"We came here after a festival for a recovery Pho. I'd been going to all the different spots in Vegas, but this one had nice reviews and was only 3 blocks away. We got the Pho Tai + the well done brisket.  It is an unassuming restaurant but the pho broth and service was wonderful. The definitely deserve a check in. The broth was full and dark, with only a slight hint of anise.  You can also tell they didn't cut the beef broth with chicken broth. Amazing and great price."}
{"text":"This place is great for anyone looking for canh chua, cm gia ?ình (family dinners to share). Wonderful family staff!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. My boys and I loved it. Everything was delicious. The chicken fried rice was delicious and the fruit smoothies are divine. Recommend this place 100% Great service as well."}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to try this new Viet restaurant in China Town.  We were extremely happy that we did!  The restaurant is located in the 168 Market complex.  It is kinda meshed into a sea of grocery stores and other businesses within this complex.  Think of being in a forest looking for that one tree.    Once you find it, inside, it is a bit small, quaint, and simple.  Just like I like it.  After speaking with the waitresses, we found out that it is a family restaurant that is run by several sisters.  Below are my ratings for service and food:  Service - I give it a 3.5 stars.  We came during the busy lunch time.  And, because they were still refining their service process and procedures, it was a bit slow.  Unlike many of the Viet restaurants that we have gone too, they were very friendly, polite, and apologize for the speed and wait time.  Food - definitely a 5 star here.  I ordered the wings as an appetizer and Banh Canh (Seafood noodle soup) as the main course.  The wings were excellent.  It looked like it was fried and dipped in some spicy, sweet, tangy sauce.  It was absolutely delicious.  The only critique that I have is that the wings need to be larger.  They were sort of \"boney\", but TASTY!  Now, for the entree, Banh Canh... Oh my!  Wow is all I have to say.  Outside of my mother's cooking, this was probably the most AUTHENTIC vietnamese Banh Canh that I have ever had.  They got it absolutely right.  I wish there was more.  Overall, our restaurant experience was very good.  It definitely made our list of top Viet restaurants in Las Vegas.  And, we will return!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good Pho. Price is about $9.99 which we at first thought was a little much based off places we're used to in San Diego but turns out the portion is huge. Lots of broth, meat, & noodles. Flavor is good. Shrimp spring rolls with peanut sauce was super fresh. We'll probably be back to try their Oxtail dishes."}
{"text":"I tried Vietnamese food for the first time here with my Vietnamese friend. The place was clean, while the staff was very friendly and nice. I thought the food was very good, but I really can't comment on the prices because my friend ordered for me and paid, it was his treat. I hadn't eaten Vietnamese food before so I didn't know what to order. I trusted his judgment which turned out very well. I'll be coming back here again."}
{"text":"A bit expensive but well worth it. A couple bucks more but not a big deal.   I'm from Orange County and there are many pho restaurants to choose from. I'm pleased to say that this can definitely compete!   The pho here has the most incredible al dente rice noodles. I don't like it when the noodle is overcooked on the broth and becomes mushy. The texture is perfect. If the broth is all important, the noodle is next.  My only gripe is that the sexy female graphic on the logo doesn't manifest herself as a server. It's just done in true Las Vegas tradition.  Thank you and please open up shop in Orange County. We got over 40k hungry Vietnamese people."}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese restaurant i've ever tried in Las Vegas. I ordered \"bun mam\" & it was so good like in Vietnam, my husband ordered banh canh, he said it was as good as his mom cooked at home. This placed run by family so they treated customer as relatives, so I strongly recommend this place for people that's looking for an authentic vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I usually go here for their Bun Thi Nuong combination with meat,eggroll and shrimps and extra veggies. Today i got the same thing and the veggies was so dried and dark. The noodles dried, you can tell its old. After digging the veggies up i found a long piece of hair half black and half blonde. They need to wear hat or put hair nets while preparing foods. Im so disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"Being from LA, I try not to take my food snobbery to other cities outside of my hometown. With that said, this place was below my expectations. My parents and I came here for Pho on a Tuesday around 10am driving back to LA. There were about four other customers in the restaurant since it was still before lunch. All of us ordered Pho with rare beef and well done brisket. I would generally expect something like Pho to be out in front of me within five minutes, but Pho Sing Sing had other ideas. Twenty minutes later with the place still near empty, our Pho finally came out.  My bowl of Pho soup tasted a little strange almost gamey. My parents also noted the same strange flavor. Perhaps the beef was old? Regardless, I was hungry and ate everything. As for my Dad, he found something strange when he was chewing on the noodles. He picked out some plastic from his mouth about the size of a half-dollar coin. The plastic was dyed slightly yellow from the oil and soup base. I think the plastic could have come from the noodle or meat packaging.    For those of you brave enough to order a bowl of Pho here, tell the waiter that you'll have the plastic bits come on the side and that you'll put that particular condiment in the bowl yourself if you feel extra hungry."}
{"text":"Just a review for late-night boba. Visited the 168 Market nearby and popped in around 9PM for drinks. Heads up about the $15 card minimum, ouch!  The two of us ordered 3 drinks, taking the third to a homebound friend on our way home- we marveled at how different and great each drink was! Opted for a taste of the traditional with the milk tea boba, the healthy with the super creamy avocado smoothie boba, and the downright weird with a grape smoothie boba, which was really more like a slushy but with an actual grape taste instead of that fake-kids-medicine flavoring I was initially expecting.  Service was a bit on the slow side, but they are a full service restaurant and they did have a group dining in for dinner, so perhaps it was just a timing issue, but the lady who helped us was very polite."}
{"text":"A great bowl of Pho. Clean, friendly, and great food. Average prices. My regular spot. Haven't had a bad dish here yet. Service is always on point. I think it's starting to catch on, because it is getting busier. Still no trouble getting a table, though. Legit af."}
{"text":"One day, my boyfriend and I were really craving canh chua, which is Vietnamese sour soup. A quick yelp search led us to pho sing sing! Now, whenever he comes to visit me, we always make sure to get some canh chua. It is just the right amount of tartness that awakens your palate and makes you want to come back for more.  We've also had the ca kho (braised catfish) and house special wings. The ca kho was a little too salty but if you eat it with the soup like they traditionally do, it's all good. I actually really liked the wings and the sauce they had for it. But I did not feel like the price was right for the amount of wings you got.  I am taking a star off because every time we've gone now, things are a little different. It's never consistent. Sometimes rice comes with the soup on the house. Sometimes rice is an additional order. Sometimes they like giving you the nuoc mam (fish sauce) and garnishes on the side. And sometimes you don't get a side of garnishes. LOL but my boyfriend and I like this place so much that it doesn't matter, and we like to think that this restaurant is just keeping us on our toes."}
{"text":"Damn! This place is on fleek! Haha. I ordered the chicken wings and wow was it amazing. The spring rolls and the peanut sauce was to die for. The pho was good too. Helped cure my hangover. I highly recommend this place the service was good and it wasn't busy at all. 5 stars. Try this place put, you won't be let down."}
{"text":"I went in for a quick bite at around 4pm. Also checking it out before bringing my family here.  When you enter, what are prominently displayed high above the counter are smoothies, not pho, do they have identity crisis?  They don't take debit card or credit card. I think that all restaurants must take debit card and credit card for any amounts, it is a \"must\" service for customer, especially in going-cashless age of today. Any one that doesn't take them gets 2 stars for service, max."}
{"text":"The sister was missing Vietnamese food after her trip to Vietnam. After reading a positive review in a local paper, we decided to give it a try. We were blown away by how flavorful the broth was. We ordered fish noodle soup, bun Cha hainoi and rare steak pho. The food was prepared by two sisters. Will come back."}
{"text":"Best foods. Clean and nice restaurant. Come back for 2nd day for 3 days trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Really good food and surprisingly warm customer service for a Viet place.   They had fresh coconut juice in the actual coconut! And a selection of other drinks like the avocado smoothie... If I didn't have a limit to my stomach, I woulda kept ordering."}
{"text":"The 5 stars speak for the quality of the PHO! Other details would receive a different score- but all I care about when judging Pho places are the Pho.  My husband and I were out and about and suddenly had the PHO urge. We decided to try a new place out so we checked the map on Yelp and fell upon the doorstep of Pho Sing Sing. It took a good while before we got served, but it didn't seem there were too many people staffed for service, so we were patient. We ordered Pho as soon as pop got to our table and were graced with one of the tastiest broths in Pho I have EVER had in Las Vegas. They also squeezed their own fresh orange juice- that was amazing as well.  So...Key points to remember when coming to Pho Sing Sing.   AMAZING BROTH- PHO'NTASTIC PHO!!!   FRESHLY SQUEEZED OJ  Be patient...it's a mom and pop shop that seems to require extra patience for service stuff.  If you like really sweet treats you will love their flavored beverages."}
{"text":"This place is awesome with great service. Everytime I go there the owners are very kind and greet you like you're at home. The pho is amazing and they have lots more options if pho isn't for you. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place has incredible food at low prices. I've been there twice. The first time, had the sea food chow mein- blew my damn mind! Second time, had the sea food pho soup- again bomb. Granted the service is not especially great being that I think the ladies don't speak English too well but the restaurant itself is nice and clean with a border line up scale feel. But who cares when you're serving the hottest  most delicious dishes in town! Definitely recommend. Tell' Eddie sentcha"}
{"text":"I went here based on the review of #vegan pho. There is no vegan pho. Staff did try to pass pho off as vegetarian, but it contains meat stock. Review is based on trying to sell me something I couldn't eat by passing it off as something I could."}
{"text":"I don't usually yelp but this place is fucken bomb. Best pho ox tail around"}
{"text":"Wow, this place was really disappointing. The service was very pushy, the pho was in the bottom 5 of all Vietnamese restaurants I have ever been to. The bun Bo hue was terrible and the cha Gia was very skinny and stale. Truly a waste of $. I will stick with Pho So 1 when in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Standard pho that was skimpy on the noodles (most inexpensive item in the bowl). Really? Anyhow the broth was pretty average. I always taste it before adding anything. One thing they have going for them is that it came out relatively hot but not piping hot. It cooled down quite a bit when adding the veggies.   I also tried the pork skin spring rolls. They were pretty good and nicely wrapped. I hate it when some places have inexperienced people making their rolls that litterally fall apart when eating it.  The price is on the high side for Vietnamese food that is just average given that I have only tried 2 items on the menu.  What really annoyed me was hearing the owners bitch in Vietnamese about a group of 14 that sat on 3 seperate tables to another group dining there that must be regulars and only tipped 7.50 for a $87 bill for one table. Each table paid seperately and were out of towners.  The other people said that maybe the other 2 tables though the table that tipped did it for all of them. The owner just snubbed and said they did not mix it up when they clearly paid seperately.  I never speak Vietnamese when I go to any Vietnamese place and can get away with it since I clearly look Chinese which I am. It's amazing how rude and how much shit talking Vietnamese do when they don't think people can understand them. The group of 14 were Vietnamese also. So why did they expect anything more? I was born in Vietnam and have been around the culture enough to know that Vietnamese generally are shitty tippers. They usually are frugal people and I am not sure why the owners would think any different being in the industry for as long as they have."}
{"text":"Coming from OC, there is A LOT of pho places so I wasn't able to come across any good ones in vegas until now. I really enjoyed the service & authentic vietnamese food this place provides. Everything is up to par :) Must try!"}
{"text":"I go here all the time with my girlfriend and friends. The owner and workers are always so friendly and attentive. I order the #8 Pho Tai and occasionally the egg rolls. So far ive never been disappointed and neither has anyone i brought!"}
{"text":"The older lady and man that own the shop makes wonderful soups. If you're nostalgic for home-made soups your elders used to make.... this is the place!"}
{"text":"Decided to try out this place one night at work with my boss. Got 2 #7's & a side of egg rolls. Total was $28, not sure how that happened but whatever I paid and left. Got back to work & I didn't expect that I was gonna have to make my own soup. Everything was on the side so it took 10 minutes just to put it together. Taste isn't bad but ginger is extremely strong. Over priced & nothing special. Egg rolls were disgusting. Won't be back"}
{"text":"This place is by far, the most UNDERRATED pho shop in Vegas! I love this place! I cannot fathom my admiration for their food. This place checks all the marks my list. Food. Price. Service   First of all, let's start by talking about their broth. It's amazing. It's not watered down and certainly does NOT lack flavor. I think this place has the best pho, Vegas has to offer! Their pho is unlike any other; with flavors so strong and adherent, it's perfect!  We ordered pho gá (chicken pho), bún (a vermicelli bowl w/various toppings), pork and shrimp spring roll, and a rice plate. We got a little order happy. But that gets me going to the next thing   Price!  This place is exceptionally priced. They should honestly be pricing higher by how good their pho is. I've been to places where pho is priced at $20 dollars or so and they do not come up to par with Pho Sing Sing's pho. Their pho is the epitome of pho, itself.   After we ate our meal, the owner walked around and talked to us. She asked our genuine opinion of the food she prepared for us. She not only makes it sound easy, but as she talks about her food, you certainly feel the home-y aspect pho should bring to you. It's the love and time it takes to prepare pho that makes it so special.   Overall, this place is a GO-TO for everyone. Unfortunately, I feel as if it is so underrated compared to pho shops in Chinatown. This pho is superb and hits all the right spots."}
{"text":"I ordered rare beef and tendon Pho. It was good, but my beef was in big pieces that made it difficult to eat. Same problem with the tendon. It took them awhile to take my order, but the food came out quickly. I never got my water refilled and had to go to the counter to request more limes and then go back for my check. Will not return."}
{"text":"Pho sing sing was such a waste of my time. I should have known from the time I stepped foot in the door.i asked the waitress if the chicken wings were spicy and she said she can make them without sauce for the kids since they can't handle spicy. Her suggestion..so I say yes. Plain wings no sauce. Awesome. Chicken wings come out full of sauce and she says don't worry. Sauce no spicy. I taste first.lady is a liar! Ok. I  say. Instead of taking it back and making her make fix her mistake. I tell her we will keep it and just make another order for the kids.next batch comes out decent. Next we order ca kho tho and canh chua. She asked if we wanted to add meat to our ca kho tho.ok sure. Why not. Another one of her suggestions... fish comes out and there's no meat. Not a single one. I ask her and she says. \"Oh. Well just eat it like that. We can't put meat in it now.\"if you are suggesting all these things, why can't you get thw order right.? Ok. Time to pay and we ask for the check. The lady says ok be right there. She proceeds to the counter totals us up. Then yells across the room and says you come here pay.wtf? Food was just ok for all the bad service here. Never again."}
{"text":"This is our second time eating here and the food is amazing, taste like home cooked food. We live near by so this will be our go to place for fresh home cooked food. The chicken wings are so good and night we had the oxtail fried rice that was delicious."}
{"text":"Ordered #14 and spring rolls. Everything was delicious. It's very authentic, fresh, rich in flavor, and the full of meat and tendon. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Love this family owned restaurant! The service was fantastic and personal. During our stay in Vegas, we went there 3 times and tried different plates and they all came out perfect! Better than what I expected to find in Vegas.   My favorite was Bo Nuong Xa (lemon grass grill beef), hu tieu My Tho (very authentic), Beef Pho - beef was tender and the broth was just right! Also had crab and shrimp Banh Canh (udon noodles)- cant complain! Everything was great and couldnt be happier to find such family owned restaurant.   We also order smoothie drinks and they were made with REAL fruits instead of powder."}
{"text":"We just love this little place. The pho may be the best I've ever tasted. As we were nearing the end of our massive bowls of incredibly delicious pho, the chef came to our table to ask how we enjoyed our meal. We were generous with well deserved praise, and I asked if she used a traditional recipe. She replied that it was her father's recipe, and one that had been in the family for generations. This little place, not fancy but very friendly, is well worth visiting over and over and over again."}
{"text":"Decent by far not the best. The vermicelli noodles were undercooked. If you order the brisket pho you will only get three thin slices  in your bowl. But it did hit the spot after all night of drinking."}
{"text":"Awesome! The hubby and I were in town from L.A. We were craving pho, so we found this place. Sooo glad we did! The pho tasted fresh and delicious...I would say much better than most Pho in L.A. We will make sure to go back to this place every time we're in town."}
{"text":"It's sad to see this place is always so quiet. It's actually a nice traditional Viet restaurant with good flavor broths for the Satay Noodle and Pho. The rice dishes are also flavorful. The place is clean and the owners are nice. This is my new go-to for Viet food. Best part is that it's away from Chinatown."}
{"text":"Delicious bowl of pho! Very tender beef in the Pho Tái - actually surprisingly tender. Perfect amount of fat in the beef cut I guess! Jalapeños were a little weak, maybe they should upgrade to serranos? Nice broth - not salty. Asked for extra vegetables, and it was worth the extra $1: broccoli, orange bell pepper, bok choy and carrots were all included.  A sign on their drink cooler says $15 credit card minimum, but when I tried using a card the hostess said they use Square and her \"phone is completely cracked\" - whatever *that* means. Cash it is then?  Enjoyed it a lot. Come here if all you want is a bowl of pho with not much atmosphere. The mirrors on the walls actually kind of freak me out. Keep your eyes on your food and you'll be OK."}
{"text":"Been searching for a good viet restaurant in Vegas since I move here and haven't found anything til I stumble upon pho sing sing . Pho is great , very flavorful. Broken  rice dishes is pretty awesome too But the banh canh is to die for .. Very authentic! Just like the way mama make it at home. Now when my friends ask me what's the best Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas I can  say pho sing sing!"}
{"text":"Foods ok. But the women that work at this place are not very nice!! When someone has a business i expect good customer service. If your looking for good customer service don't waist your time coming here."}
{"text":"very good authentic vietnamese food, the service is great! Little slower when its very busy but they make it happen with what small staff they have"}
{"text":"I'm Vietnamese and a vegetarian. This is the first authentic Vietnamese place I've found that has the best food! I will definitely be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Pho Sing Sing is sooo good! Before leaving Las Vegas, we stopped by Pho Sing Sing because we wanted something soupy to cure our hangover :) I'm Vietnamese so I typically don't order pho when I go to Vietnamese restaurants because I prefer homemade pho. So I opted for their banh canh. Wow, it was sooo flavorful! I It was one of the best banh canhs I've ever had! It definitely hit the spot! My husband, who is Chinese, opted for the pho like usual. I tried the broth because I was curious. Surprisingly it was really good! It tasted really fresh, and I could tell there was definitely no MSG there! I normally don't care for pho, but this time I kept alternating between his bowl and mine. The best of both worlds :) I definitely recommend Pho Sing Sing. It tastes like fresh, flavorful, homemade cooking :) We definitely left Vegas extremely satisfied! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"wanted some Pho after a foot massage-- since we're from LA, we yelped and picked Sing Sing-- ordered Pho #11 #13 and fried egg rolls-- pretty good! friendly staff thus good service-- not a lot of customers eating in but lots of pick-up orders!"}
{"text":"This place has the best summer rolls In town! I usually order shrimp summer rolls that come with a sweet chili sauce and the tofu summer rolls that come with a peanut sauce. Their sauces are sooooo good! On point flavor with the peanut and sweet chili. The rolls are big! If you are vegan or vegetarian you could come here as just get the tofu summer rolls as a meal! I love this place for their summer rolls! So if you're looking for some good Vietnamese summer rolls, this is the place!"}
{"text":"I am a tourist coming to Vegas at least twice a year, and I always come to Pho So 1 for Vietnamese food but on fourth of July, Pho so 1 was so busy so I decided to try this place out based on reviews on Yelp. I can say this is my most favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas so far. I had Hu Tieu Nam Vang (the Cambodian style of noodle soup) and it was so delicious. Very authentic and tasted just like ones I had in Vietnam. My picky eater 1 year old love the noodle too.   Hubby had Satay noodle and he liked it a lot. The beef was so tender and flavorful. We also tried fish cake which I love so much, so crunchy. If you are not a fan of fishy dish, this is not the dish for you. I had milk tea which is so good. The servers were so nice and funny.   Besides, they also have Special menu that has Bún Mm, h tiu cá, bánh tm, oxtail ph. I would definitely coming back for mo authentic food."}
{"text":"Food:  very authentic and flavorful Vietnamese cuisine.  The noodle soups are tasty and the egg rolls are made in a unique way to emphasize crispness.  They are also full of good ingredients.  Finally, the fruit smoothies are very nice, especially with the aloe boba.  Service:  is friendly, attentive, and courteous.  They are one-the-spot and pay attention to customer needs.  Ambiance:  is clean and organized with booths, as well as big and small tables.  It also has a family/relaxed atmosphere that is welcoming.  Value:  is average for a Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Good menu for a small pho place that include some items not offered at mamy other pho place like Beef sate noodles and a duck noodle. Great flavor without being overly salty."}
{"text":"The customer service is ridiculous because the server has no service skill at all. I ordered a Pho special TO-GO, the soup and the meats are cold. I called to the restaurant, the server said she though I will eat it at home, so I can microwave it. She also mentioned  most of customers would do it that way. WT Pho... \"most of \" is not equal \"all of \", at least she needs to ask the customer first, before she put in the order."}
{"text":"Pleasant service. VERY clean.  Offered white and/or dark meat for grilled chicken entree which was juicy and fresh. I found this place by accident and have put this place on my list of favs."}
{"text":"Low on taste.  High on price.    I was craving pho & fried egg rolls with the rice paper wrap.  Couldn't find many places in Vegas that serve up those kinds of egg rolls.  So, I talked my husband into taking me here.    Before coming, we decided on what we wanted because we anticipated the usual Viet-style service  - which is to give you the menu & zero time to peruse it before demanding your order.  And sure enough, our waitress did exactly that.   I changed my mind about the pho because I could not smell any pho aromas at all.  Not a good sign :/  I ordered just the egg rolls.    Hubby ordered banh mi, but was told \"don't have\".  Ummm ok... So he settled on chicken wings & taro smoothie with boba.    The smoothie came out first.  Boba was over cooked & mushy.   Egg rolls came next.  They had either been refried too many times or had been left in the fryer too long because they were extremely oily.   Chicken wings came out last.  They were unseasoned except for a drizzle of the sweet chili sauce that you can buy at any Asian grocery store.  Very bland dish.   Our 3 items cost about $25 total.  That's steep for Viet food.  Were we overcharged?  Idk.  Doesn't matter though because we won't be back."}
{"text":"It is a short drive to get to, at Sahara and rainbow, but worth it. I got the egg rolls and a fresh Taro boba no pearls. Both were 5 stars. Customer service is so good. Super friendly, super clean, nice ambiance. I hear they have the best pho and oxtail rice, so I will try that on next visit. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant with my son yesterday (Sat) around 2pm.   When we went in, 2 people there (assumed they were owners?) were taking lunch, but was greeted and seated immediately.  I read some review here saying it's \"authentic\", and that's why I wanted to try. The thing is, I don't know how authentic pho supposed to taste like lol Never visited Vietnam or had a bowl of pho there. So if I was told this is authentic pho, all I can say is \"okay\" :D  Simply based on my preference, broth was tad a bit sugary. But besides that, there's no harsh saltiness, good depth in broth, fresh garnishes, plenty of meat; it was overall pretty good.  One thing I appreciated the most here is, when ordered, I only ordered one pho, and asked for extra bowl so I can share with my son. When the extra bowl came out, it was accompanied by a pair of food scissors  if you're a parent, you know how much this small consideration was appreciated.  Good customer service! Good food! I will stop by again :)"}
{"text":"Lovely family owned restaurant took the time to make a delicious plate for me near closing time. The meat, the noodles, the herbs, the fish sauce, brought me back to Saigon. Will return with more stomach"}
{"text":"Today my wife just got out of surgery. That's why  I wanted some good soup but I don't really know where to go. I've been to pretty much all of the Vietnamese places around. So I turned to Yelp like I normally do if I can't decide on a place especially a restaurant. So we checked this place out. And let me tell you guys, this place did not disappoint us. They have some unique flavors of boba drinks. Their broth for the Pho is the Bomb! One of the ladies looking like the owner explained to us the difference of her broth from the rest! We enjoyed our late lunch a lot! Service is excellent because they personalized it. They paid attention to all our needs. We will be back for some more Very Good food! Thank You! Pho Sing Sing!"}
{"text":"Empty on a Sunday morning so we were able to sit anywhere. Prices are decent, a bit higher then what I'm used to... (I'm from OC) $10.99 for Banh canh, $8.99 for pho tai, $9.99 for bun bo hue.   Friendly service and no weird tasting water. We asked for small bowls to share the food because we wanted a little of everything, and they gave us 3 which is great because I find that a lot of places will always give you not enough bowls. The Banh canh came out first and the owner was super sweet and told me (in Vietnamese) to eat it before it gets cold and that the other dishes were coming out shortly. Everything came out really hot, fresh veggies, lots of meat and delicious broth for all 3 dishes.   My sister didn't like my Banh canh but I did. She enjoyed her bun bo hue and her bf said the pho was good.   Definitely come here if you don't want to deal with the wait (and tap water) at other pho places in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Excellent service great food. My girlfriend and I are not very experimental when it comes to pho so we stuck with the pho tai. The broth had an excellent taste and the soup was fresh and hot. Even my girlfriend liked it and she is super picky. The standout though was the smoothies they're really freakin good I ordered the taro which tastes like cookies and cream and my girl ordered the strawberry and banana which was really good to she swore it was the best smoothie she ever had which is funny to me cause I know she loves her smoothies and ice cream. Overall great place I will be back."}
{"text":"Very good place to eat, highly recommend! prices are very reasonable. I always take out, last time I was there they made a mistake on the order call them back and let them know about the mistake they  replaced the order l'm very satisfied"}
{"text":"What a contrast to Pho 87! (please see my review and DON'T patronize such jerks!) Pho Sing Sing was very friendly--no trouble to put a few veggies in the large $9 bowl for no extra charge. Tasty broth, which I understand is MSG free, and tasty meatballs, brisket & veggies. Totally recommend this spot. I'm going to try their smoothies too, which look amazing!"}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas you must stop by!! The owners are so friendly and everything is delicious!! I can never decide what to order because I want everything! You must try the banana with coconut if they have it!"}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas, I order coffee glass jelly, hu tieu nam Vang"}
{"text":"All the employees here are always so nice. The pho broth is bomb here! The oxtail... Not so much. It wasn't tender enough. It's way overpriced too. The rare meat is also not that rare. It's kind of chewy. I still love this place though. I'll just get meat balls next time. Lol   I think you're supposed to pay at the \"counter\" but they don't make it that obvious. For starters, there's no real counter. I was looking around for the cash register after waiting wayyyy too long for the check, then waiting wayyy too long for someone to collect my method of payment. They should at least put up a sign. Sorry if I missed it.   I will continue to come back here though. I really enjoy the pho broth and how nice the employees are."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not well known by many tourists, hidden away from other well known Vietnamese restaurants on Spring Mountain road.  Serving very good authentic Vietnamese food, clean restaurant and very friendly service.   Highly recommend"}
{"text":"A wonderful little pho spot! It's clean, the food's great and priced well, and the service is lovely. What more can you ask for? I'd recommend it to anyone in the area that's looking for some delicious pho!"}
{"text":"Living in the heart of Little Saigon (Westminster, CA) I'm accustomed to very good Vietnamese food. I'm a Bun Bo Hue and Banh Canh addict. So on my first trip to this restaurant I ordered the Banh Canh... All I have to say is EXTRAORDINARY! I usually have to add fish sauce for flavor to every dish... First spoonful of this Banh Canh, I was surprised that it had more than enough flavor to please the pickiest taste buds! I definitely recommend this on a cold, gloomy day or any day in fact! By far THE BEST damn Banh Canh I've ever had!!!!  Okay, on to the Bun Bo Hue. Like I said previously, I love lots of flavor in my broth, this soup was everything beyond my expectations. I usually add extra chili paste to this to make it even more spicy! But without the extra chili paste it was perfection. Squeeze lime! And you're all set for a belly full of happiness! :D  THIS WILL BE THE ONLY VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT I WILL DINE AT FROM NOW ON! Go now or your stomach will be mad at you. ;)"}
{"text":"I Will never eat here again, first off I like start by saying that when I came into the restaurant around 9pm all the employee were all eating (5ppl total) and as they ate they took my order and credit card (very unprofessional) nevertheless I order a bowl of veggie tofu Pho to go and as I got home and got comfy I noticed that half way threw my meal I found a small roach... I was so disgusted that threw up, Awful moment I will NEVER again will I eat here !!"}
{"text":"My favorite pho restaurant! And I'm Vietnamese! Have to come here at least once a week for the Bun cha ca thi la (dry). Their egg rolls are the best I've had in Vegas, they use rice paper wrap instead of regular egg roll wrap so they have a little chewy texture which I loveeee! The pho broth is very tasty All the ladies there are nice and friendly! Highly recommended for anyone want to have good Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"As we walked in we saw the \"cash only\" sign and started to walk out since my wife and I only had about three bucks in cash combined. One of the employees said they could take credit cards after we told them why we were leaving. How convenient. Obviously, they just don't want to deal with credit card fees. I can't fault them for that, but it's not exactly a business practice I like.  Our lunch consisted of the goi cuon ($4.95) -- shrimp and pork spring rolls that were missing any sign of pork. The bun cha gio ga nuong ($7.95) was decent. egg rolls and charbroiled chicken with noodles. The portion size was plenty but the chicken lacked flavor. Adding plenty of fish sauce helped a little. The broth of the pho tai ($7.95) had plenty of flavor and was the highlight of the meal.  Service was excellent and friendly. They didn't have a problem with me sharing the bún with my son and even brought out a separate bowl with noodles for him. Located at Jones and Desert Inn, it's closer than other Vietnamese places so chances are I'll be back."}
{"text":"We've tried many Vietnamese restaurants in the Las Vegas area, but we have now found THE BEST !! Pho Sing Sing has it all !! The food and reasonable prices are only surpassed by the superior service.  Located in the Chinatown area of Vegas, plenty of parking, clean and comfortable.  We could not be more pleased ! The 5 star rating is WELL DESERVED !! P.S. Don't even consider leaving without trying the Taro Smoothie !!!!"}
{"text":"My  husbands friend CC recommended us to try Pho Sing Sing. What an amazing experience since I am just now becoming familiar with this delicious cuisine. Pho Sing Sing is new to our neighborhood and what a joy to have them right around the corner. It was cold out and I was craving something warm and delicious. I stopped in and ordered the vegetable Pho! It was great! I can't wait to try more amazing dishes. The staff was really sweet too! I am going to tell all my friends about this lovely little Pho restaurant that is sure to impress!"}
{"text":"We recently moved to Las Vegas and once again started our search for the best Pho.  I must say we have been very disappointed with the pho places we have tried. I have been selecting based on Yelp reviews and some have had decent pho such as Pho So 1 but fall short with the horrible service.   Pho Sing Sing hit on all cylinders. Nice clean place with a good atmosphere and very welcoming upon entry. The service was great and they didn't disappear to never be seen after delivering the food. But the most important thing is the Pho. It was easily the best I have had in a long time.   The broth really stood out as broth that was made with care. The meat in the broth was all so tender and of high quality.   I was surprised to find they were only open 7 months so if you haven't tried Pho Sing Sing you should"}
{"text":"Loved this place, the waitress knew exactly what I would like. Will for sure return. My bf ordered the pho bc he as sick. It sure did the trick! I ordered the fried rice and orange chicken. It was amazing. Love it. It is a far drive but it is very worth it"}
{"text":"Parking: large lot.  Ordered my food and the lady got it wrong. I ordered egg noodles rather than rice noodles, she argued with me for a bit, which is why I am giving them 3 stars. I found the food extremely delicious though, the hue satay was really good and then dry noodles was really flavorful.   Credit card only if you spend a minimum of $15."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here regularly for their hu tieu sate and banh canh tom cua. Happy to find this place when I first moved here (helps with my Cali food cravings). I also love their egg rolls appetizer and durian avocado smoothie.   Good service and friendly staffs."}
{"text":"We love the new location. The pho here is the best I've ever have. My husband and I really enjoy the food and friendly service. I highly recommend Pho Sing Sing."}
{"text":"Bomb food. Slow service. It was busy when we came in around 2pm but it was great. The pho, the springrolls, eggrolls, fried rice and vermicelli were all so tasty. No more driving all the way to springmountain for pho loveee it!"}
{"text":"Best smoothies ever!!  Vegetable soup is also delicious for those cold winter nights!"}
{"text":"Good reasonable asian food, kinda pricy but this is vegas. My favorite was bot chien."}
{"text":"FOOD: 4 SERVICE: 5 AMBIANCE: 4 VALUE: 4  A surprising find in a non-descript strip mall. It's not very big, and from the outside, it appears to be just a run of the mill Vietnamese Pho restaurant. However, once inside, we were greeted by a Caucasian guy speaking perfect english, promptly seated and offered drinks. Turned out he was the husband of the owner. But, he didn't stop there, he came back and asked us what we wanted, explained the menu items and checked back on us often.  We ordered the following:  1. Egg rolls: these were wrapped in rice paper and deep fried. Served with plenty of lettuce, mint leaves, pickled carrots and cucumber slices. Very delicious, crispy and stuffed full of tasty meats.  2. Sing Sing Special Combination: this is their special Pho which means every kind of beef, raw/cooked/tripe/tendon/balls, served with thin rice noodles in a savory, flavorful beef broth. You can really taste that the broth was made the right way with beef bones and me at.   3. Spicy Beef Satay: served with either rice or noodle. We found that it was unusual to find satay in a Vietnamese restaurant, but the owner assured us that it was a traditional dish where his wife came from. As the name suggested, it was more than a little spicy, but the satay sauce and roasted peanuts really enhanced the flavor of the tender slices of beef.   Great food, great service and fairly inexpensive, what else can a couple of hungry tourists ask for?"}
{"text":"Very good. Bright clean friendly place. Eclectic mix of tunes playing in the background.  I had the grilled chicken, pork, and egg roll bun. There was an awesome tangy chile sauce on the table and they make their own fresh.  Also they have a huge boba bar with all fresh fruits, veg, etc.  One of the owners checked on us twice and then came over and chatted with us when we were done.  Will def come back."}
{"text":"Very good service but the food quality could use improvement. I always order bum (vermicelli) with grilled pork and eggroll. The noodles were stiff a.d the eggrolls tasted old. On the upside, the boba was delicious."}
{"text":"Wow. I need to write more words but \"wow\" sums it up lol. Best pho I've had ever. And I've been everywhere. Right next to my work it's so convenient. I'll keep coming back. No doubt"}
{"text":"My family was craving pho and came here for lunch.  Service was not the best and food was average.  We probably won't come back."}
{"text":"It's my fourth time coming to Pho Sing Sing. I'm partially biased to Vietnamese cuisine because I had the wonderful opportunity to live in Vietnam for a couple of years. I would like to tell you now, this is by far the most authentic Vietnamese restaurant I have ever had in the United States. The Cha Gio, Goi Cuon is made fresh, unlike the other restaurants I've eaten at. The Pho Sing Sing special broth is spectacular - not salty or too much anise, it's perfect. Their portions are generous even their noodles (Ask my husband how I can just inhale noodles). My husband had their pork chop with kimchi and picked vegetables on the side; note - their Vietnamese omelette is to die for!!! We also had their dessert, made from beans, sticky rice - FINALLY A VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT WITH DESSERT! So good. Besides that, I love the whole family atmosphere they have. Rose, one of the gracious owners of this restaurant is so friendly. She took care of us. I truly believe in making your meals extra special, Rose gave us the best customer service. :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the pho here. I found the broth to be extremely flavorful, the portions were decent and the prices right.   Service was standard for a Vietnamese restaurant, nothing great or bad.   Overall, I'd say this will be my go to pho place."}
{"text":"We ordered #22 and #24 which are Udon noodles w/crab, shrimp & pork and egg rolls & BBQ port vermicelli.  Excellent and tasty food.  Friendly staff but never got H2O refills.   Service was a bit slow and dishes were not served at the same time.  Regardless we would still return."}
{"text":"Every time I go here it hits the spot. The Chicken Pho is always my go to and I can't get enough! The service is outstanding. Definitely one of my favorites."}
{"text":"It is a small restaurant I ordered the special combo pho, and my friend ordered a vegetable pho. The broth on both pho were absolutely delicious. You can taste all the subtle flavors that were used in the broth. You don't even need to add anything to it."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the most deliciously authentic Vietnamese food in Vegas. Imagine if you were in the country in Vietnam and a family invited you over for some Sunday dinner comfort food. This place uses real broken rice to deliver the best Com Tam dish ever.   Com Tam is a famous comfort food dish in Vietnam and this dish is superb and beyond authentic on every level. It is number 29 on the menu \"Com Tam Bi Soun Cha\" which consist of the most delicious shredded pork, a perfectly seasoned pork chop, egg meatloaf over fluffy melt in your mouth broken rice.   There are so many places here in Vegas that do not know how to cook this dish and use regular steamed rice instead of broken rice. Here at Pho Sing Sing they nail it authentically. Order it, you will not regret it and be in total foodie nirvana.    My roommate ordered the number 25 which is the eggrolls and charbroiled chicken vermicelli. It was amazing and such a huge portion.  We also ordered the Pho Dac Biet and split it. OH MY GOD it was incredible. The broth sends you straight into flavor heaven without all that MSG ickyness. It is so good!!  So glad this restaurant exists. It is truly a gem and makes me really happy to have such incredible tasting Vietnamese Food by people who truly know how to cook it."}
{"text":"1) The food wasn't that good. Usually Vietnamese food is pretty reliable, but this just didn't taste right. The soup was too oily, and the meat was seriously lacking.   2) The menu options are very limited, and a little odd. I asked if the seafood noodle dish had an option to get chicken instead (very normal for most Vietnamese restaurants), and he said no. Then he said, \"so you don't want the pork heart in it?\" It didn't sound like a joke. He did end up putting two slices of chicken in as a favor, but that was just strange.   3) The owners were babysitting their kid or a family friend's child... they lifted up the child so the kid could stand on the counter and play with the stuff that was higher up. This is the counter for food and she was stepping all over it with her shoes after walking all around the filthy floor. Not okay."}
{"text":"If you want real authentic Vietnamese food this is the place to go to. We started with spring rolls and egg roll. They were  very yummy. Had the Ox tail Pho. It was very GOOD!!! A must have!!! The Best pho I had in Vegas. Hubby had the Spicy beef noodle soup ( Bun Bo hue). He said it was very tasty and good. My mom had the seafood noodle soup (Bun Mam). Just to let you know this soup have a very strong smell. It's supposed to smell like that. She said \" It was very delicious. Made just right. Have to be a true Asian to enjoy this.\"  I would definitely come back again :) New Location on Rainbow and Sahara"}
{"text":"Pho tasted blain, no flavor . Not good at all.  You can't split the bill, ok I can accept that but the service was horrible."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a Pho spot in North Las Vegas so we ventured down to Sing Sing and we are extremely impressed. The food is delicious, the portions are huge, service is fast and very nice.   We have found our new go to Pho spot!"}
{"text":"Overall great food and nice service, it's pretty clean inside too. I usually order their combination pho soup and their egg rolls which are so good. And their variety of drinks are delicious, I really love their Vietnamese coffee. I did put 1 star off because you have to spend $15 to use a credit card while most places require only $10."}
{"text":"I met five friends from out of town here for lunch.  Pho Sing Sing was chosen based on the Yelp reviews.  I ordered the spicy beef satay with rice noodles.  The pho broth was good but it didn't live up to its spicy descriptor.  I added a fair amount of Sriracha but that only added some spiciness to the dish.  I enjoyed the peanuts and sesame in the pho.  One of the people in my group said she tasted MSG the rest of the day.  I couldn't discern that but she knows better than me.  With the number of pho places, this would not be my first choice in the future."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good Vietnamese food for being off the main stream of Asian restaurants on Spring Mountain."}
{"text":"Food was not that bad just lack of service and didn't seem like they cared for the business or wanted the business. I got a bad vibe from server and the place was empty with me and another table."}
{"text":"I just came off my patrol unit graveyard shift. I have been here before and felt I needed to share this location with yelp. I normally go to the spinal rehabilitation center around the corner for my neck and noticed they where  \"out to lunch\" so I thought I would come over here and grab a bite before the spinal Officer reopens.  When you first walk in it is very warm with a relaxing vibe. Settle on the eyes after a long  night/morning shift.  I was not sure where to sit but then a kind gentleman \"employee\" said I can sit any where with a welcoming smile. I loved how quite it was for the time I needed peace. When he served me the meal I was not quite sure what I wanted but knew I was going to get the shrimp spring rolls they are very delicious.   But if you do not like sticky foods I'd advise to stay away. Still!! I love them very much because it is a light dish with vegetables, sticky noodle, carrots, shrimp and a sticky roll. The sauce?   The sauce is to die for. Man let me tell you the taste is just perfect. Not bitter, hot or tangy more sweet and nutty. Loved it!  And then I got sautéed beef w/ Lemongrass & Onions.  Wow just wow! Not to much vinegar or lemon it was a beautiful blend.  If you like food that pops in your mouth you must come down here. The staff is very polite and helpful when you are indecisive with your order. Lol  This will forever be my place until they go out of business which I hope they NEVER do.  Thank you for your service Pho Sing Sing!"}
{"text":"Wow !!  I didn't check the price when I 1st visited here but today I check the bill after I paid . For 2 people $31 !! Really !?  I got  a Beef pho , my husband got Cajun shrimp with steam rice . Really over priced..."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Vietnamese restaurant in town! I highly recommend the oxtail pho and oxtail fried rice! It's amazing"}
{"text":"Best Bun Mam , banh canh cua... chè dau trang in town... best service . We will go there again and again"}
{"text":"This place makes a great pho! I really loved the broth! This is what makes a great bowl of pho, right?  Deep beef flavor and a pronounced hint of spices used in making the \"liquid gold\", ie. cinnamon, clove, star anise, and others. I thought this was not a salty bowl of pho, which is often the case at a lot of pho spots, so I was again, pleasantly surprised with this bowl.  I got the Pho Chin Nam Gan Gau: Which is Rare Steak, Flank, Brisket and Tendon.  Brought to you with the usual suspects of Thai basil, sprouts, sliced rounds of fresh jalapeños, and lime wedges. I like to add them all, but it is completely customizable, along with various homemade chili pepper sauces and hoisen.  My girlfriend got the meatball soup and gave me a couple of them!  I noticed that the special of the day was ox tail pho, but I had already ordered by then, which is a true shame because back home, I always get the ox tail in my pho .  No worries! I was completely satisfied with the bowl I had and am ready to hit this up again next trip down here!   This place is Jake Approved!!"}
{"text":"No wait but not sure if it's a bad or good thing. Service was top notch.  Prior to coming here, we went to two different Vietnamese places and they were so packed that even those who were seated has been waiting at least 20 minutes for their food (was told by the female sitting with her bf waiting for food - total wait was an hour for them) once i heard that. no thank you and lets move on. We came across Pho sing sing and were seated immediately with the server giving us suggestions on what is popular. Ordered banh canh and it was a party in my mouth, flavorful and not salty at all. Some of my friends ordered rice plates and the portion was decent especially coming from guys who works out on a daily bases. They can eat and for them to say that was filling and good. Pho sing sing - mission accomplished!"}
{"text":"In my ongoing quest to find good pho in Las Vegas, I've finally found a second success.  Pho Sing Sing is located in a pretty large plaza on Jones near Spring Mountain. It shouldn't be overlooked, although I managed to do so for a long time. Perhaps I was put off slightly by the association of the name with a certain correctional facility in New York, but my mom recently cleared up my misconception my informing me that it was also the name of an old restaurant in Vietnam. With other dinner plans in the neighborhood falling through, it was an easy plan B to come here instead.  I went straight for the pho dac biet ($8.95). My order came out within a few minutes, which is a good indicator that they have a huge pot of piping hot broth waiting in the back, like any good pho restaurant anywhere should. The bowl was plenty large, and the tray of Thai basil, bean sprouts, sliced jalapeño, and lime wedges was reasonably sized. First taste of the broth definitely made me happy, and a squeeze of lime didn't change my liking of it too much one way or the other. The varied selection of meats, including thinly sliced beef, fatty brisket, and beef meatballs, definitely hit the spot with tenderness and savory flavor, and the noodles weren't anything to complain about. Cilantro and onions, also standard, completed the experience.  I'm putting Pho Sing Sing up there with Kinh Do on my list of pho recommendations for Las Vegas, and I have to give it the same rating to indicate that it's also among the best in town. It's definitely worth a visit if you're a homesick California transplant or even if you're a casual eater who mistakenly thinks that Pho Kim Long is any good at the namesake beef noodle soup (hint: it's not). The only minor quibble for me is that it's a few minutes farther from the highway than Kinh Do is, but that probably isn't relevant to all my friends in Summerlin."}
{"text":"I'm so addicted to their seafood banh Chanh. Best in town especially with fresh ground red peppers.  I came here with my family weekly to order banh canh."}
{"text":"Was craving pho today.  My boyfriend n I came to eat here.  So I order him XL bowl cuz he's a big guy n mine regular.  When it came out, the bowl was the same size but different style of bowl.  Regular was $8.99 n XL was $12.99.  What a joke.  Last time eating here.  Service:  they just drop off your food n never heard of them again.  What a service.  Yup a typical Asian restaurant I guess.  Eat your food n beat it."}
{"text":"The food was ok, I got same soup bowl which I always like it, but it had less meat then pho so 1. I like pho so 1 better, grilled beef was sweet and tasty. My BF ordered rice, which was pretty good though."}
{"text":"We were driving around looking for Pho in Las Vegas. We went to Pho Sing Sing based on the recommendations on Yelp. I had vermicelli noodles with chicken and egg rolls and my wife has the seafood noodle soup. We also had Shrimp Summer Rolls and a Taro Boba Smoothie. The food was very good and the service was excellent. The owner told us that she's a former singer that's why it's called Pho Sing Sing. By the way their Boba drinks are excellent. For example, on the Taro Boba Smoothie which we really loved, they don't use Taro powder like most Pho shops. They said they actually cook the Taro themselves and blend it in the drink so the drink does not get too watery or too sweet. It was in a local crowd so Pho Sing Sing was a good find-we'll be back on future trips to Las Vegas. The restaurant is only a few minutes from the Down and the Strip/ I-15- lo at Spring Mountain Road. This is in an area with Asian Plazas with Chinese Hong Kong/Dim Sun, Korean BBQ restaurants and Asian grocery stores etc. Check it out."}
{"text":"My friends and I were looking to enjoy some pho and spring rolls this weekend while being in Vegas. After reading a couple reviews we finally decided to drive and head down to this place. Shortly, after we arrive we were seated and our waiter quickly left without giving us any menus to look at. So we sat down patiently waiting until he noticed. (This went unnoticed for a couple of minutes) Finally he came back and placed menus on or table and did NOT even try to offer us any kind of drinks or water!!  I ordered a chicken pho.. unfortunately the broth had absolutely no taste alone. The shrimp spring rolls on the other hand were delicious! After receiving our food, no one ever came to check if everything was ok or if we needed something.. All of us had already drank up our water, and no one came to offer a refill either. My group and I are not ones to yell for service or look around to find the waiter. The service was definitely lacking. It was time to go pay, and the lady had already calculated the amount on her register, without knowing that I told her it was going to be separate orders. She did not hesitate to roll her eyes directly at me and make it obvious she was annoyed. (Which made no sense because we had told our waiter they were going to be separate orders to begin with)  Anyways, I felt that I overpaid for what I received and will not be back.  I hope if you're from another state, you don't waste your time in this place."}
{"text":"If I could leave no stars I DEFINITELY would!! So, I thought I'd give this place a try after reading a few reviews... VERY STUPID IDEA!!! I walked in and was the only customer... Ordered the #7 Pho Dac Biet... As soon as it was placed on my table, I had to ask for limes, Beansprouts, Ice Water and even Napkins... I tried a spoon full of soup broth before I added anything, and it tasted fine... As I added my limes, beansprouts and sriracha I started to mix it all around... As I was mixing I noticed something floating around.... As it rose to the top of my soup I found a dead COCKROACH bathing in my food... F@#king GROSS!!! I Stood up furiously spitting out what broth I had in my mouth, and almost throwing up from being nauseated... Manager or owner comes by and asks what's wrong and I immediately took out my phone camera out and said LOOK there's a cockroach in my Pho... She immediately knocks my phone out of my hand and kicks me out... Wow!! No apologies, no explanation, no NOTHING!! As soon as I left, Nevada Health District Called... I HIGHLY SUGGEST NOT EATING AT THIS PLACE!!! Unless you like EXTRA Flavoring... LMAO"}
{"text":"Delicious Bun Mam, Hu tieu Nam Vang, bot chien. I really like it, I will be back again."}
{"text":"Pho in vegas has been a hit and miss lately, ranging from places that were good, but has gone down in flavor, to just down right \"what the pho is this\" type of deal.  I thought I had tried most of the pho places in vegas, but with no way of going more downhill in my hopes than before, I thought, \"you can only fail if you don't try.\"   The pho broth was actually good...but as someone else wrote, there may have been a lot of MSG since I was parched soon after, and downing 2 glasses of water during your meal is telling.  The egg rolls have that rice paper exterior, which makes for a unique but yummy egg roll. Pho So 1 is the only other place I can think of that uses the same type of paper.   More importantly, the interior of the egg roll was amazing. I've gotten quite tired of egg rolls that either aren't crispy enough, over-fried, or just bland. The sauce was a bit strange tasting than what I'm used to (more salty than sweet), but, it was a good run today, and I am gonna say that this place is ranking at the top in the pho broth department compared to a few other places. Is it as good as OC pho? HELL NAW.   I give a SOLID 4.5 stars for now."}
{"text":"yay, a vancouverite can relate to them, as they opened a new one in Vancouver, BC a few months ago.  Kudos for family restaurants that spread their wings internationally."}
{"text":"The restaurant is called Pho Sing Sing but you shouldn't come here for the Pho. You can order the Pho if you'd like, there is nothing wrong with it, but where Pho Sing Sing shines is with its other regional noodle dishes.   This is one of the few Vietnamese restaurants in town that serve Northern style Vietnamese noodle dishes. I unfortunately didn't take note of all the names of the regional dishes, especially since I went the extra step and googled a few things on the menu to figure out what they were before I ordered them.   Come here if you are looking for a greater depth of options in your Vietnamese cuisine. It's located in the same plaza as Wendy's noodle cafe next door to a Taiwan deli. So much good food in this little area of Vegas!"}
{"text":"Came here cause I saw they had banh canh which what I was craving for. Food came out fast and the soup was delicious. The workers were friendly too. I will come back here for more Vietnamese food :-)"}
{"text":"Horrible, we will not return.    Pho Dac Biet = nothing special about the special Pho Tai = where's the beef (tai) Jalapeño and sprouts was old  Com bi thit Noung cha gio= meat was cold had to ask for new plate.  Meat could have been from last night - Yuk!  One last note, cash only"}
{"text":"I have a radical idea for this business. They should only sell egg rolls and that's it. They should have combinations of egg rolls order like a chicken strip joint. 3, 4, 5 combos. They should have egg roll sandwiches and dessert! Ok you get my idea. They make amazing egg rolls. And yes, all they other items are top notch!"}
{"text":"We are from OC, California. And pho/ viet restaurant are everywhere in OC but this restaurant is as good as OC. We came here for Christmas and so tired of buffet.  Our friend recommended to us. Omg so good.  Best pho in town We ordered  pho  (best) so good Banh  canh ( so good) But thit nuong (good) Com tam bi cha thit nuong (good) Hu tieu satay (it was ok, unique) We liked 4 of 5 dishes. Will definitely come back next time we are in vegas."}
{"text":"You can find Pho Sing Sing in the 168 market plaza on Jones/Spring Mountain, but you have to go deeper in to the plaza. It's a small little restaurant located right next to a HK cuisine restaurant (I think called HK Star?)  I'm a fan of this pho place as it really has the mom & pop shop feel to it. Everything feels and tastes homemade and the pho broth is perfect and great. The prices are not to steep either and I really like their spring roll appetizer... it tastes freshly made (which in Vegas I have found that most places have it pre-made and out for a very long time).  This is definitely my go-to pho place and they are almost always never fully so there are always seats!  Do note that when you come you should plan to either pay in cash or use venmo if in a group because there's a $15 minimum charge on credit cards."}
{"text":"tasty authentic vietnamese food. I got cha ca and it's the best cha ca I ever have. The waitress is very friendly and informative."}
{"text":"We went here because we've been here before, I think.  This is in a typical Asian strip mall in Chinatown, Las Vegas.  The food was decent and caters towards Asians.  I ordered a Beef Tendon Pho dish (I think #13), my husband ordered a pork dish with rice (#30) and my daughter ordered a vermicelli noodles with pork and egg roll (#24, I think).    We also ordered a black jelly mocha drink, an order of egg rolls, and spring rolls to go.  The food was alright.  My beef tendon pho tasted a little different than I'm used to, like it has some lemongrass.  It wasn't too bad though.  The egg rolls looked different than what we're used to, like they had acne.  But we were told that is the authentic egg rolls and they were gluten free.  The food was attractive, colorful.  We didn't know they didn't know they only accepted cash, no debit or credit cards.  So we had got a $3 charge to go get some cash.    The service was good.  Blake was our server and he gave us better service than I would have expected from an Asian person."}
{"text":"Very good authentic food and nice lady owner! Must go to Vietnamese restaurant when you are in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Oh boy! The food is bomb. First time here, their Bun lieu is very tasty, Bun mum is so good.  Highly recommended if you are in Vegas. The service is excellent."}
{"text":"Found this really good hole in the wall pho place when I was craving it for breakfast.  It's definitely a well maintained mom and pops managed restaurant located in the same center as 168 Market.  The owner was very kind and he took my order. I wanted to try that Nem Nuong Cuong (grilled prom sausage spring roll) but they didn't have it here. However he suggested I tried another grilled pork spring roll and it was SO good! Perfect flavor of marinated, thinly sliced meat wrapped with a nice charcoal grill taste. Highly recommend it. I also got my usual pho tai with bo vien.  Noodles came out al dente, but perfect once it sat in the soup and cooked itself to the perfect consistency.  Good big portion. Soup was tasty. The rate steak and meatball was a great texture-- not too dry. Definitely will be back! Great service!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the flavorful pho broth here, no condiments needed to be added.  Just a little squeeze of lime and it was perfect!    The Banh Canh is also very good.  It tastes homemade and they are generous with the portions.    For appetizers, the chicken wings were extremely flavorful!  I like how crispy they were.  I definitely recommend the drinks here also.  They have a selection of different types of dessert drinks.  I had the Honeydew shake and it was delicious!  Creamy and flavorful.    Overall, I was very happy with my experience here.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I've been to many Vietnamese Restaurants looking for real authentic Vietnamese Cuisine. Me myself being Vietnamese it was hard finding a spot that's close to home cooking. The way Moms already cooked it.   After coming inside with family, we were greeted and seated with care. Felt like I was going to an Aunts house for dinner lol. Place is clean & the many options of smoothies caught my attention. I ordered the Rice Plate since it's my most favorite meal. & wow...it came out fresh off the grill and prepared to perfection. I didn't get a chance to take a pic since I choked down right away. That's when you know the food was good.  I'm glad to find a place close to home in terms of meals. Will be coming down. Anything on Spring Mountain Rd are all \"Fast Food\" versions of Vietnamese Cuisine. If you want real authentic food. Come here! Underrated and the definition of a hole of the wall. But those spots are always the most unique and best places to dine!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! My wife and I were visiting family in Summerlin and we wanted to try a new place! It was very very very cold outside and it happened to be January 1, 2015! So we were in the mood for some hot soup!  Pho Sing Sing did not disappoint! From the warm welcome by the owner himself to the amazing Pho and specialized chicken spring rolls they made fresh just for our special request, I can't recommend this place enough! You must definitely try it when you're in town!"}
{"text":"I don't eat Pho a lot but, when I do, I'm very picky. I don't like eat the noodles a lot. I eat a little. My main thing about Pho is the broth and Pho Sing Sing's broth was AMAZING I went to Pho Kim Long and it was my biggest regret of Las Vegas. Pho Sing Sing gave me better service and was more friendlier then Pho Kim Long. I wasn't rushed to order or given a bad attitude when I got there. Pho Sing Sing, you guys are the best!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and every time the food was amazing and staff is very friendly. My favorite is the egg rolls (ch giò) and bánh canh tôm cua.  My bf loves his bún ch giò tht nng too. It's small and hidden but food is on point !"}
{"text":"Lousy attitudes, not really care about what we order. I heard more cup, spoon, and chop sticks dropping. Kind of like accident happening.   We order fresh spring rolls.. OMG, so tiny! Smaller than Philippine longanisa with only one small piece meat and one small shrimp.  My party and I ask for some lemon/lime, server walked away with \"WE HAVE NO LIME! NO LIME TODAY!\"   WHAT KIND OF PHO RESTAURANT WITH NO LEMON/LIME!?  In case anyone wondering, There is a large \"Asian 168 grocery store\" near by the restaurant in the same shopping center.  Over all, food is not impressed. Seafood noodle has only one piece of shrimp and one piece of squid, some beef-like meat!  Vermicelli cold noodle with no taste chicken/pork and tiny egg rolls even longanisa is bigger than that.   I highly not recommend this pho restaurant whom ran out of lime!  DO NOT COME HERE IF YOU NEED LEMON/LIME FOR YOUR PHO!"}
{"text":"Wow! Stumbled upon this place, we were looking for some pho saw there sign and just went in and I am so glad we did! Besides are local pho place in California this is the best pho we have ever had! I judge good pho by the broth I feel the less hoisin sauce and Sriracha I have to put in that's some good pho!  They aren't stingy with the meat either another great sign!   There egg rolls were amazing great flavor. I'm knocking off a star because they're milk tea and green tea were not great.. No flavor but wouldn't deter us from coming back! If your hungover after clubbing and need your pho cure this is your place!"}
{"text":"I started going here at the original location on Jones and Spring Mountain. I finally got a chance to go to where they moved to on Rainbow and Sahara and I literally forgot how good it was.   I think they have the best Vietnamese egg rolls ($7.99) - they're wrapped in rice paper and fried (which is my favorite way) and their chicken wings ($8.99) have a fish sauce type sauce on them which is so flipping good.   We got a rice plate ($10), oxtail pho (I think it was a little over $10), and bun bo hue ($10), and we gladly finished all of it. A big plus is their veggies for the pho are always super fresh, just like the ingredients they use for their food.   I loved the old location but this new location is cool - a little hidden - but the food is still really flipping good. The ladies are always so sweet and it's one of the best places to get pho in Vegas. Even my Vietnamese boyfriend (picky AF over Vietnamese food) loves it there.   Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Went to this place a while ago. This place was a bit far away from Chinatown so I didn't think it was going to be that good.   Yeah actually location is not that big it's very small quaint and very clean. The lady that helped us was very friendly she made a lot of suggestions.  I'm not a huge pho fan, but it was cold and I was craving some soup being a vegetarian it's hard to find places that have vegetarian pho, so this is one of the places that I found. I like their pho, the veggies were fresh and the broth was delicious. It's a bit pricey but nothing too crazy.   The thing that made the most impact was their mango boba, it tasted delicious it was freshly made and I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have to agree with a previous post that the price here is high. Pho is okay. The price level does not match the service or food at this place and therefore my 3 star rating is reflective of this. The high pricing point is a turn off for me to return or recommend this place especially with the service level being mediocre."}
{"text":"had Hi tieu nam vang( Cambodian style seaford), very good, Bang canh tom cua(udon noodle soup/ real crab meat shrimp + pork. Nuoc mat hor e(passion basil seed jellydrink), must try."}
{"text":"My family recently stayed in Las Vegas for 3 days and wanted to have some Vietnamese foods on our first day. We found Sing Sing on Yelp with good rating, and we glad we did come and try.  The Pho is excellent here. I am a big fan of Pho. And being a Vietnamese, I am very critical about this dish. Pho at Sing Sing was beyond my expectation. My sons are 9 and 4, and they also love it. Both of them and I ended up eating only eating Ph twice during the 3 days we were there. I am sure if we'd stay longer, we will be back again. My wife and my Mom tried \"Hu tiu\" (other noodle soup) and \"Com tam\" (Broken Rice dish), and said they are delicious also.  The restaurant is small, but very clean. The service is very quick and friendly. The owner (I think) is really nice and friendly which make our meals more comfortable and enjoyable.  I am sure every time we go to Las Vegas, this is the place we will be coming for Vietnamese foods."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and boy was it amazing! The vegetables were fresh and washed properly, and the place was spotless. We ordered pho tai and the broth was delicious as was the entire entree. The chicken wings here are to die for, freshly cooked and the meat was fuckin great!"}
{"text":"Pho Sing Sing is a family owned and run restaurant. You can tell they take pride in serving high quality authentic Vietnamese food here.  Be aware that the Pho does have msg, like almost all Pho places. There was a yelp tip that said no msg here, I asked our waiter about it. He said he didn't know, so I asked one of the cooks who said they do use msg, but not a lot.  I tried the spring rolls and several vermicelli bowls. Everything was delicious. The vermicelli noodles were perfectly cooked, the bean sprouts and other veg was fresh and crispy, the meat was nicely trimmed and marinated, and the fish sauce was perfectly balanced.  So far this has been the best Vietnamese I have had in Chinatown, it sets a much higher standard for how good this food can be. I will definitely be coming back to try the other dishes."}
{"text":"The Pho Tai here is awesome! The restaurant is very clean and the staff very friendly and attentive. They take cash only so come prepared. Also had the egg rolls which were very tasty!"}
{"text":"This was our first time eating Vietnamese food and we really enjoyed it!!! We had egg rolls and chicken wings for appetizer both were good. Main course was beef with rice and chicken with rice both very good!!! Meat was very tender and flavor was great. But most of all this is a family place and you can feel the love when you enter the door. Service isn't even the word we felt like we were a guest in their home. My family thanks you for a lovely dinner."}
{"text":"Best in Vegas and absolutely worth the drive away from the strip and Chinatown. The food is better than other popular Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown, and renown Caesar's and Palazzo. The pho broth was boiled for 16 hours, authentic and rich. The meats were perfectly cut and did not overpower the noodles. I loved that their pho came with fresh chopped Thai chilis too (unique to their restaurant). The eggrolls were superb with chicken, pork, shrimp, all in one, and comes with a variety of vegetable lettuces that added a sense of freshness to the rolls. This place is a must try!  As for service, the restaurant is ran by five sisters who were short handed. I almost got up and left but glad I didn't. A little patience goes a long way here and they were so sweet and accommodating."}
{"text":"I rank this restaurant Top 5 Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas.  Authentic style Vietnamese.  Nice atmosphere.  Reasonable price for Las Vegas.  Good for sit down or take out.  The owner Cindy is very very nice.  She treats you like family.  Overall - As good as it gets."}
{"text":"I drove here and I refuse to dine at places that are cash only. Accepting credit card is a convenience for the customer. This place doesn't respect customers."}
{"text":"Pho is fresh, soup base is hot and tasty, service on par for the older guy and woman, the younger one needs more training in customer service, place is roomy and bright, portion to price ratio is fair, will recommend..."}
{"text":"Good pho! I stumbled across this looking for Sylantro (which has moved or closed). It looks like they'r in the process of redoing the sinage outside, but the dining room was newly refurnished and the food was good."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese Restaurant. My family and I enjoyed the food here upon our visit to Vegas. Will stop by here again next time."}
{"text":"One of the few times where I trusted yelp and it has disappointed me. My coworkers wanted to eat pho before heading to the IBS show and I found this spot on yelp with good reviews and was open at 9am so we gave it a try.   We were in a rush so I called ahead and ordered our food early so it'll be ready when we were there but the guy on the phone didn't speak Vietnamese... He said the owner wasn't in yet. He only knew a few words in viet. He sounded like a douche over the phone and was a little rude. That should have been the first red flag.  When we arrived, it didn't seem like a Vietnamese owned restaurant. More like a Chinese restaurant... Another red flag.  The guy that served us as friendly but he was middle eastern? He did pronounce the food names correctly in viet though... I give him that..  As for the food, my husband ordered the pho tai Bo vien with tai on the side. The beef came out first before all the food? Weird... And it was more pinkish grayish instead of bright red... Another red flag...  My coworkers order Hu tieu nam vang kho and it was okay. Some of the meats that came with it didn't belong in there... The garlic in the side looked light green?? Strange?   I ordered the Bun Bo Xao and it was okay. Not bad. Beef had some flavors but the meat was a little dry.   One thing that was better was the egg rolls. It was cooked fresh and crunchy.  Overall, I've had better. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I've been to Vegas several times and had never tried this place out until today! My only regret was I wish I knew about this place in then past! Hands down the best place to get your pho fix! Had the bun bo hue and it's as authentic as it can get! Really good! I would totally recommend anyone that is around come to this place! Love the environment, really friendly staff and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Just had a vegan pho with their homemade hot sauce and I will forever go to this spot. Not only is there food always delicious, fresh and homemade .. but their staff is so nice and friendly ! I recommend this place to anyone !!"}
{"text":"So after looking for a place for good pho I finally found it! I got excited and decided to order quite a few items off the menu, plus I had my family with me and we were hungry. First let me start with the reason why we came here, the Pho. I ordered Pho Ga & my hubby ordered the combination Pho. The bowl was huge and the portions of meat and toppings did not disappoint. I have to say hands down the pho broth here is AMAZING!! It's so hard to find a good broth but look no further, because they have it here!  We also ordered fried rice, chicken fried rice to be exact-- amazing as well! The taste of this rice reminded me of a place we frequented back home and that place was known for their fried rice. The portion was very good as well.  Next we ordered two types of rolls, fried spring roll and fresh spring roll. I am not sure if that's the correct name for the fried one but that's how I've always known it as my whole life. Both were delish and both were devoured. I have to say, the peanut sauce for the fresh spring rolls was on point!  So I know at this point I probably had enough food but I'm a huge fan of chicken lemon grass so when I saw it on the menu I had to order it as well. The flavor of this lemon grass was the best I've had in Vegas, a prefect mix of spicy and a good amount of the lemon grass flavor.  Before we left we ordered some smoothies with boba to go. I had the almond coconut, my kids had the banana and peanut butter-- I tried all of them and they were all delish as well. I could clearly taste the flavor of each and it wasn't watered down like some other places. Th boba was also fresh and soft.  So that ended my feast and I can say I have found my Vietnamese food spot and I will definitely be back and recommend Pho Sing Sing to all my friends!  Oh and I can't forget the service! Exceptional!! Very attentive, very nice and very welcoming!"}
{"text":"Good pho, and the bbh was pretty good too, if only a bit milder than most other places. Service is fast and courteous."}
{"text":"Needed a place to get some pho at 9am on a Tuesday in the morning and this came up during my search.  I would give this place 3 stars for the food and service here.  If I saw anything that would make me lower my rating, I will do so in the future.   I don't know how it is in the afternoon or at night for the food & service, but for the morning...It was on point.    Got a bowl of hot pho here.  The usual rare beef and beef balls.  My lady got the bowl of the usual also.  I would come back here again when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Extremely good food and wonderful friendly staffs. Our group had the Bun Mam and Mi Vit Tiem and they are super delicious. Highly recommended and will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Always looking for a new pho place to try I knew this was next on my list. The place was pretty busy on a Saturday night at 8:30 pm so that was a good first sign. We received menus immediately and ice water. Pho tai is my go to but I decided on pho with flank and brisket this time along with the usual rare steak. The boyfriend had bun bo hue his favorite. We also ordered egg rolls to start. Very crispy and piping hot. Could have had a bit more meat but it comes with quite a few pieces so no complaints. Bowls of pho came out not too long after that. My bowl of pho was piping hot which I appreciate you could see bits of pepper floating and it was served with lemon. Waitress said limes were too expensive at the time so that was a bit of a bummer but the bowl was so good it didn't need much. Usually I only add a squeeze of lime and jalapeño to my bowl because I love the broth.  I don't like to add hoisin or sriracha to my bowl and it shouldn't need it if the broth is good. This is probably one of the best bowls I've had in a looooooooong time. I can't say enough about how much I loved my bowl of pho. Dip the meat in hoisin and sriracha and I was in heaven. My boyfriend also loved his bun bo hue. I would come here again and again it was PHOnomenal."}
{"text":"First time here and boy, its was good. The Nam Vang Dry Noodles was bomb!!!  Customer service was really good. They were really attentive to each table."}
{"text":"When I think of the ambience and food of Pho Sing Sing, I am reminded of the pretty great and authentic Vietnamese restaurants in Westminster, CA.  As you walk in, you are greeted with friendly staff, then immediately seated.  Throughout your dining experience, you will probably be asked once or twice about how everything is going - which is a bit uncommon for a Vietnamese restaurant or, perhaps even just small-business Asian restaurants in general?.  Anyway, the staff is very charming, and makes you feel welcomed.  I ordered a rice dish, which consisted of grilled pork chop, shredded pork skin, an egg cake, pickled daikon and carrots, thin slices of cucumbers, and nuoc cham (dipping sauce).  As complicated as this dish sounds, it's actually fairly simple, yet the chef(s) manage to make everything taste great, especially the smokiness of the pork chop.  Now, a lot of Vietnamese restaurants have their own recipe for nuoc cham, but Pho Sing Sing's is one of my favorites - just a smashing blend of saltiness, sweetness, and sourness.  This dish also needed more pickled daikon and carrots; I remember it having only about a handful of shreds.   Their bot chien (fried rice flour cake) was good, too. I am not a huge fan of this dish, cause I think that a lot of places make it taste bland.  However, I was surprised that I actually quite enjoyed this dish.  The rice flower cake itself was semi-crunchy, which I think is supposed to be like that - I mean, it's cooked and mixed with a scrambled egg.  Their dipping sauce for the bot chien was a good compliment to the dish as a whole.   I've also tried their dessert drinks as well.  Their basil seed drink is perfection in a cup - it's semi sweet and just tastes like liquefied jello (not in a gelatinous state) mixed with basil seeds. TRY IT!  Their mocha jelly drink was good as well - like if you were in the mood for a drink that kind of tastes like an iced chocolate milk drink and a cappuccino with jelly floating around, then I would say order this drink.  Their che 3 mau was deliciously amazing, too (it's pretty much like halo-halo). This review is getting quite long, and I'm not too sure what's in this dessert \"drink,\" and I won't even tell you to order it.  But, if you don't, then you are missing out.    Anyway, this is a great new Vietnamese restaurant.  Give it a shot if you are ever in the mood for a new Vietnamese restaurant. I know I will be back just to try out how their other dishes taste.   Also, a tip:  they have a cash only sign, but they do accept cards through Square, I believe.  You will just be charged $1 extra."}
{"text":"Pretty good beef pho.  I like the stocky soup, real flavorful and u can see the beef bits.  The pho noodles were chewy not overly cooked.  My only tiny beef with the beef noodle soup is that i only got 3 slices of beef and 6 whole beef balls.  Skimped on the more expensive stuff.  And kind of stingy on the fresh veggies too."}
{"text":"I give 4 stars because the food here is very good and authentic! This place looses a star because the service can do with a little bit of help. It is not on the menu and there are only certain days that they have the bot chien voi truong, which is fried rice flour cakes with eggs. It is so delicious. Honestly it is the best one in town. I am always disappointed when they don't have it.  The bun rieu is amazing! It's the best restaurant bun rieu I have ever had in my life. The best one is home nade, of course. But wow. The bun rieu really blew my mind. Bun rieu is my favorite food in the entire world. It is a tomato based soup with little puffs that are similar to small dumplings made of crab and shrimp, and it usually comes with some pork, tomato wedges, and shrimp. I love how generous that they are with their portions of the dumplings and noodles. I love the broth. It is so good. I definitely reccommend this dish! I have also tried the bun thit nuong cha gio, the vermecelli noodles with grilled pork and egg rolls. DELICIOUS! The best egg rolls I have ever had. They taste jusy like how my parents make them. I love the food here! The only downside is that the servers will take your order and bring your food then leave you alone. They won't double check to see if water refills are needed. And when I need something I always have to walk up to the counter to ask in order to get their attention. But the food is great!!!"}
{"text":"In search for the best Pho Tai in town!  After a strong recommendation from a friend, I decided to give Sing Sing a shot :)  Pho Tai ($7.95): Rare Steak Noodle Soup. SOLID bowl! Good mix of fresh, crisp, and oily broth. The noodles are a bit thinner and taste softer/fresher than most others. The steak itself cooks super fast in the broth but remains tender/flavorful.  The broth itself is a little more subtle than my favorites in town, but it is a very good bowl and worth a try!  Also tried the Thit Nuong ($3 on menu but actually $5). Very good grilled pork, cooked perfectly with crispy edges and 100% edible, non-chewy fat. Only thing I can complain about is the price...they say $3 on the menu but charged me $5. Not a huge deal to me, but this could be a problem for others. Also, at $5, this would be the MOST expensive side of grilled pork I've ordered in a Vietnamese restaurant.  Also, I was given incorrect change (even at the higher price).  Obviously it could be an honest mistake, but I am put on edge after the last minute adjustment to the price of the food as well.    Just keep it in mind when you drop your check."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants I've been to! The spring rolls were perfect! The shrimp tastes fresh not fishy. I ordered the rare steak pho... There's this delicious hint of cinnamon. Everything is super fresh and the restaurant is clean. The staff is so nice. The chef lady even came out right away and asked us how our food was!"}
{"text":"now that I've eaten here. it caught us off guard that the food would be good but it actually was. they also have good boba here nice soft texture. my wife also agreed so let's get to the meal.  egg rolls 4/5-perfect sized egg rolls that have a unique crunch to it and what I love about their egg rolls they give you a lot of vegetables I love the pickled daikon and carrot which they provide here with the lettuce and mint of course. gotta love the sweet fish dipping sauce too!  pho dac biet 4.5/5- that's a big deal because this is now my second favorite pho place to eat. the broth is awesome it's light, yet so flavorful and their pho soup was hot which is how it's supposed to be. sometimes restaurants get scared to serve it too hot as in temperature but it's supposed to be. they come with rare steak, brisket, tendon and meatballs. very good  bun lemongrass beef and onion 4/5- vermicell noodle with lemongrass beef and onion pretty decent dish if you have had bun it has similar qualities of all bun cold noodle with meat and the sweet fish sauce.  milk tea with boba 5/5 and coffee smoothie no boba- great smoothies and drink the milk tea was so good and boba was so soft I would definitely come back just for the boba.   overall it was unexpected but great meal you are now my #2 go to pho place..I'll be back for sure:"}
{"text":"Yum!! We wanted to find a pho place to eat to cure the boyfriends hangover after NYE and went here. I've been here before once but it was 2 years ago. This was our first meal of 2018! :)   The owner is super nice and the place has plenty of parking. Lots of tables and booths, surprisingly it wasn't too crowded probably because we came a bit earlier and people were sleeping off their hangover from the night before.   I got the Bun Bo Hue and the bf got #12 pho. The Bun Bo Hue was delicious - the perfect blend of spices. The broth was sooo good and they don't hold back on the meat either.   The pho was good! My boyfriend liked it but as I didn't try it I can't say much.   I also got the matcha tea slush is which was pretty good. I normally like my drinks overwhelmingly sweet but this one wasn't too sweet - but still good!   I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My friends and I ordered pretty much everything on the menu.  Our group was huge so we got to try each other's food.  We ordered our items to go so it took a little long.  When we got our order and left, we later realized some items were missing.  The staff had called us about the mistake and apologized.  They threw in some free coffee for our troubles.  The staff were really nice and friendly.  I got the Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong - Charbroiled Pork and Egg Rolls - I never could go wrong with this dish.  One of my faves.  I tried all of my friends' food as well.  They were good, others decent."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly folks.... fast service..... everything I am looking for in a lunch restaurant.  I will have to try again for dinner!"}
{"text":"Really nice and clean place. The pho is even better than Pho so 1 and I think I can comfortably say that this restaurant may have the best pho in Las Vegas.   The special lemonade was too acidic for my taste but the mocha with coffee jelly is delicious!"}
{"text":"So we were suppose to try the lobster pho across street, but got into the wrong restaurant, and it ends with good experience.  We had the fried chicken wings and pho combo. The wings are skinny but the Thai spicy flavor is tasty.  Their beef noodle soup is very sweet and full of beef bone flavor. They sprinkle black peppers in the soup, so if you don't like black peppers, ask them.   I think this is a good and authentic place to eat pho. Highly recommend.  P.S: they charge $1 for hot tea, so if u don't think it's reasonable, get a water instead. I've seen reviews complaining about that. To me, it's quit reasonable. Every restaurant has their own rules N charges, we either take it or leave it right!?"}
{"text":"It's bulking season for me so, I took an empty table for 4 which got me a funny look from the server. I'm hungry and I want pho...and all the food. Don't judge me.  It's a small Vietnamese restaurant in the same complex as 168 Market. It's clean and doesn't smell funny. But you get the same cold treatment that you would expect from any Asian restaurant.  Cha Gio: Egg rolls with shrimp, chicken and pork. Hot, crispy and meat-filled fried rolls you wrap in lettuce and dip in that vinegar + fish sauce goodness. 4/5  Pho Tai Nam Gau: Beef vermicelli noodle soup with rare steak, flank and brisket. The meats were a bit too fatty compared to most places and I'm not a fan of animal fat. However, the broth was good. Next time, I'll get something with with just the rare steak (pho tai). 3.5/5  Bun Cha Gio Ga Nuong: Vermicelli bowl with egg rolls and charbroiled pork. I love this and pho. It's really tough to pick one over the other so, I had both. I was supposed to save this for dinner but I'm not a procrastinator so, I ate it like there's no tomorrow. 4/5  For all the food I got, I only paid about $27."}
{"text":"I went there today, and ordered a watermelon smoothie, after I got my food I didn't hear the blender, so I reminded the waiter. I guess they forgot. When I went to pay, I just paid. But later on realized they charged me for 2, oh well I guess I won't go back there again."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out for dinner one night with some friends. One of my friends said their duck noodle soup was really good and I've been trying to find a pho place that I can stick to and honestly love.  So I decided to order pho of course! With beef balls and rare steak, which is typically what like to order at a restaurant. Two of my friends ordered pho while one ordered the duck noodle soup and the last ordered their beef satay noodles.   The broth was okay. It seemed normal to me. I think the flavor could be a little stronger? The broth was really light to me. At least the broth wasn't sweet! Sweet broth makes me want to pour a jar of sriracha in it to cover the sweetness. haha. The noodles seemed kind of overcooked. I actually like my beef balls to have tendons in them and theirs didn't so I was a little disappointed in that. The rare steak wasn't all that impressive to me either.   Service was okay however they did forget one of our orders. Friend ordered an avocado smoothie but it never came so she just decided to cancel it.  Overall, it was okay. I do want to go back to try some other stuff.. probably not their pho though."}
{"text":"Pho is one of those foods that to me it's almost impossible to mess up.   Like chicken fingers or a grilled hot dog, as long as the basic components are there, even if they're not cooked 100% to my liking I'll probably still be able to finish it off and be content.  So I often see reviewers, including my favorite reviewer of all time Tetsuro P go on about the nuances of a particular pho broth, and how different one might be to another, but to be honest my delicate palate just must not be able to distinguish those nuances.   I've had bowls from a place like Sing Sing where it's a labor of time and love to make the broth, and bowls that were whipped up in 10 minutes flat using pho cubes from 99 Ranch and enjoyed them equally.   Essentially I'm starting this review by telling you my tastebuds might be pho-tarded.    As such, my driving force on whether or not I really enjoy a pho joint is cleanliness.   Pho So 1 I had always heard was one of the best bowls in Vegas, and I did enjoy it a hell of a lot, but the 5th hand smoke lingering in the air since presumably the days of Mad Men and the fact that I feel the need to sanitize my hands every 5 minutes I'm in there bring it down a notch.   If I'm in Vietnam or when I've visited Hong Kong and Taiwan, I'm very much willing to put these things aside for the pleasures of great food, but when I can get a bowl of Pho down the street at a cleaner place and with my lack of Pho-sensibilities, I go clean over dirty any time.  Enter Pho Sing Sing:   very clean, doesnt reek of smoke, and serves a bowl of broth with noodles, beef, and other things I've never really known what they were, plus they provide sauces and the typical bean sprout/jalapeno fixings I require.   That's all I need really for a pleasant Phoxperience.   Everything tasted great, but unfortunately as I said before I couldn't really distinguish it over many other Pho bowls I've had.  Pho is just delicious, period.    They do the \"stack of spoons\" and \"shared chopstick\" method of utensil delivery which I'm not a fan of (though everything seemed clean), and service was very friendly but a little shaky.   I ordered the combination as I'd said and my friend ordered the Pho Tai, and when the server brought mine out he put it in front of my friend.   I told him I ordered the combo, and he looked at the bowl he brought out and said \"yours is coming next\".    3 minutes later the Pho Tai came out and we had to switch them.   To be fair the tendon and other discerning characteristics of the combo pho were somewhat hidden, but I still found that a bit sloppy.  Tighten that up and they'll be well on their way to 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Sorry had to change my review because I came back to eat dinner here again because I missed the iced mocha jelly, my husband had pho and I had the vermicelli and a soda but when we got charged the man charged us $10 over and we didn't realize until we left as we recalculated our order.. So as a tip make sure they don't over charge you by calculating your order before you pay.. I was very disappointed...:/"}
{"text":"So I was looking for a closer spot for some pho. Just hate driving all the way to spring mountain. So I looked up pho restaurants and came across this one. As soon as I walked in I was greeted and seated. Customer service was awesome!! Ordered pho combination and spring rolls. Oh man they were both on Hit. The pho had a great taste! Won't be driving to spring mountain for pho!"}
{"text":"I love the bun mam here, it's so delicious...everyone here are very friendly and funny... Love this place totally come back soon."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short and simple, I visited this restaurant twice.   First time, I thought the food was just ok, so therefore satisfactory.   On my second visit, I ordered food to go.  One of the dishes was a $13 catfish dish, the other was a $13 shrimp dish.  When I got home, I noticed both of the relatively small containers were less then half filled. I thought could this have been a mistake? But I doubt it because it happened to both dishes.   Anyhow, I found 3 small slices of catfish wrapped in foil, barely enough to fill 1/3 of the container... My guess is I got about maybe 4 oz of catfish for $13.  NOT COOL!!!  Same goes for the shrimp dish.   Anyhow, I posted pictures for proof.  Avoid the take out."}
{"text":"I walked into this place and was treated horribly. I wasn't greeted, the larger parties took priority and despite there being plenty of tables to seat me, the waitress brought me a rickety foldout table. It was disgusting, well-used and pulled from the kitchen."}
{"text":"While I was looking at Yelp, I saw that Pho Sing Sing had 4 1/2 stars and it was located next to my favorite Chinese restaurant, Hong Kong Garden, so I decided to try it. My friend and I decided to order egg rolls and pho. The egg rolls weren't the best that I've tried in Vegas and were kind of bland even with the sauce. The pho wasn't anything special and my friend found what looked like a nose hair in her pho, but the owners said it was just hair from the beef but changed her bowl of pho. I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair. When we got the check, they did not charge us on the pho, but while we were handling the check, we saw a cockroach on the wall. Disgusting! I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"One of the very best vietnamese restaurants in Las Vegas !"}
{"text":"Good flavor Pho, and love the egg rolls"}
{"text":"Delicious!! I eat pho at least 1 time a week. Came across this little gem and thought I'd give it a try. Had the chicken lemongrass with rice. Best I've ever had! I will be back!  Thanks for the great service and food!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite pho restaurants in Vegas! It's a little mom and Pop spot that has all the traditional dishes and tastes very authentic. Their bun bo hue and banh canh are my faves ! The drinks and desserts are really good too , they are not overwhelmingly sweet. The owner is super sweet . She reminds me of my mom .. very nurturing and easy to talk to. We came here after my gf had her wisdom teeth pulled and she went out of her way to cut the noodles for us so it would be easy to eat."}
{"text":"Food had no flavor, pho barely had meat it in, poor service. Barely touched my food and went straight to Pho So 1."}
{"text":"Man delicious pho.   Good amount of beef slices as well.  The soup came hot so that's a plus.   Ordered number 12 came fast and the sprouts basil look fresh."}
{"text":"Great dinner with 10 members of our family.  Pho was terrific, great spring rolls, service amazing--very personable.  Will definitely return next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent pho! We are visiting Vegas from Alaska and although we are staying on the strip we had to venture off to have some phò. This place didn't disappoint. We hunt out phò at any city we visit and surprisingly this was one of the best we've had so far. I ordered #15, the brisket and meatball phò. The broth was flavorfull and clean, and you could taste the aeromatics but they weren't overpowering. The meatballs were plentiful and the brisket was tender and tasty. It also wasn't overly salty and I didn't get that salt bloat I sometimes get with other phò's I've tried. The service was great, nothing to complain about there, either. We will for sure be visiting again the next time we are visiting Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place probably taste better after you have been to The Source nearby but I thought the food was just average.  The Pho did not overwhelm me with its broth.  The service lacked in speed and friendliness.  However, I may like it better the more I go there."}
{"text":"FRIDAY before Palm Sunday and NO MEAT today, so we stopped by nearby and ordered Mi Sau Shrimp and Yellow noodles with fish soup.  The menu lists many of my favorites, so I'll just have to come back, I said to myself and try some of these when we are around Sahara. (I wonder if the Lemon Grass Chicken will be to my liking), anticipating a new found restaurant!  I must say the soup was so flavorful and the Vietnamese Chop Suey was delicious. 1 star for courteous, 1 star  for clean, 1 star for flavor!  PROBLEMS: My veggie with shrimp was soaked with gravy and did not come with rice or any carb.   The seafood noodle was 70% soup.  They asked if we preferred water or tea without telling us it was NOT FREE.    I AM UPDATING MY REVIEW: Got home and I had to go to the bathroom right away. THIS MORNING,  we both suffered from diarrhea. MUST BE SOMETHING IN THE FOOD.OR IN THE PREPARATION !!!!!!! Sorry, won' be coming back."}
{"text":"So excited that they just moved into my neighborhood. We came in for a late lunch and loved it. The broth for the pho was outstanding! High quality beef that tasted very fresh. We started with the egg rolls and would highly recommend them as well. Everyone that helped us was very attentive and made us feel so welcome. I have been hoping to have a restaurant that I love move into this area and have finally found it. They deliver within 3 miles too, so I can be as lazy as I want to be and enjoy their yummy food."}
{"text":"I ventured off the beaten path from my regular pho spots and decided to dine at Pho Sing Sing. I recalled a best pho thread on Yelp Talk and several people said the pho here is pretty darn good. My friend and I ordered eggrolls, spring rolls and pho tai. Eggrolls had a different kind of wrapper and was really really good. The spring rolls were wrapped fresh and had a nice chewy consistency. Even the shrimp inside tasted fresh. The pho was beyond my expectations. It had a nice light, clean broth and the tai meat was tender. Plenty of meat and perfectly textured noodles  I'm sold on the pho alone but the customer service will always keep me coming back. The ladies/owners that run the place were so kind! All 3 ladies that helped us exuded joy, kindness and genuinely wanted us to enjoy our experience. I felt like they were my Vietnamese aunties goading us to enjoy our food. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Originally my friend and I were going to Pho Lan to give it a try since its her name, but it was closed on Sunday. So a quick Yelp check offered up this place which I'd never been to. When I did get there, I realized I had been there before...a couple times, but when it was under different ownership. Not sure when this changed hands.  My friend ordered the Pho, I went with the shrimp and pork spring rolls and lemongrass chicken over rice. I sampled the Pho and it was pretty tasty and looked like a decent portion. The lemongrass chicken was very flavorful, although a touch dry but you could tell they had grilled it on order. Spring rolls were weird because one was huge, and the other small. Decent flavor a little light on the pork but good. Thai tea with boba was a bit too sweet for my taste, and too much ice in the cup.  Overall, it was decent, and like its predecessor, I would come back. Still have a few more places to try though.  One note - Cash only and there's an ATM at the CVS Pharmacy nearby."}
{"text":"I recommend skipping this place in the future.  5.24.2015 down to 2 stars I brought family this time to show off how good this place was. However, was met with disappointment. Super disappointed that the quality has gone down. Egg Rolls are still good. Meat cuts are still good. Pho noodles came out too soft. Soup base came out bland like it had not been prepped properly... so I reached for the fish sauce. Had to add fish sauce--but their cut out on the bottle was so big that i nearly dumped half of the bottle into my bowl. I tried to fix it by quickly scooping out the excess sauce--which turned out ok. I tried to ask for a replacement but all the workers were way too busy in the backroom to respond to me. So i just ate the meat cuts. We also ordered a grilled meat dish. The moment it cooled down, the meat became crispy and sweet like candied meats. Not a fan. Service was mediocre. The waiter messed up on our order and forgot that two members of our party ordered food. Our food came out but half of our table's food didn't. After waiting awhile, we asked and it turned out that their orders were not it. So then their food came out toward the end of our meal. Tried the drinks too -- Stop here and save your money. Basil seed drink and the matcha tea shake. Basil seed was way too sweet like syrup out of a can. Matcha tea had way too much cream and not enough matcha--it's like drinking a cup of half and half in shake form."}
{"text":"I am trying Pho  rare steak, flank and brisket!! With a passionfruit smoothie and a mango smoothie!! Trying to get my vitamins in this sun!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend & I stopped here on a very cold and windy day and we're glad we found this place! Definitely a go to spot for pho. Everything was different from the regular pho places we've been to. We ordered fresh spring rolls & egg rolls which were amazing. They looked different, but were filled with flavor. Then we ordered rare steak and brisket pho, and rare steak, flank and brisket  pho. The broth was THE BEST I have ever tasted. I usually add all the condiments, but with this, I didn't feel the need to. I thought I would ruin it if I added anything else because that was how good it was! On top of that, the service was excellent. We were treated like family. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Been here now about seven times.  Every time it is spot on.  Consistency is the key and this place is clean, peaceful and the pho is amazing.  This is my go to pho place in Vegas. I was yearning for a slice of back east andI found it.  If you are looking for the best pho in town look no further."}
{"text":"Great place to try Vietnamese food! #30 was an amazing dish. Don't for get to try them out!!"}
{"text":"Great pho, very delicious and large portion. Super nice service, very polite and honest staff. Will be definitely back the next time we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly staff.   Just remember to check with the wait person about the ingredients if you are allergic to peanuts.  We make a special trip across town just to eat there."}
{"text":"I am really disappoint. definitely won't come back again.  I come in with my little sister the other day, I ordered myself a special pho, told the waiter clearly that I don't want any green onions, i really hate the taste of it, but when the waiter brings the food, it don't have green onion, that's good, but it also missing cilantro and regular onion.   So, I ask him, can I have some cilantro? he pause a bit and went back to kitchen, few seconds he is back, and guess what he told me? he told me:\" sorry we DON'T have cilantro\"  I know HE WAS LYING but I didn't say anything because my little sis is with me that day. also when we half way done with our meal, the other customer order a pho and I SAW HIM CARRY WITH CILANTRO to serve them.  what can I say? that's not a busy day, only us and another table, he or the chef didn't wants satisfy the customer is fine, or maybe the owner didn't care either, I will definitely won't recommend this place and me and my friends won't come back again!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! This restaurant serves the best Vietnamese egg rolls in Las Vegas. My husband and I ordered the pho and beef satay pho and it was very tasty and full of flavor. The staff was so nice and friendly. I highly recommend this restaurant:)"}
{"text":"Cash only!  I would have ordered more, but I spent the last of my precious cash for a hair cut plus tips earlier.  So after making sure I had enough to cover what I ordered (Shredded Pork, Charbroiled Pork& Egg Loaf with Broken Rice), I waited patiently for my food. Leos L was not as lucky, and had to make a run for 168 Market before they closed (which turned out to be a good thing, as he scored on some end of the day dim sum specials).  Anyway, service here is average.  They are nice and promptly delivers the food once it is prepared by the kitchen, just like most other restaurants.  The food was just A-OK as well.  I have had better and I have had worst.  Room for improvements?  Yes!  But the broken rice plate that I ordered was decent, and I cleaned my plate.  Portion was average. Enough for the average diner.  What I think can be improved upon (how they prepare the grilled pork on the com tam and bun dishes).  One of the things that Leos and I both agreed on during this meal is that there are a lot of Vietnamese restaurants here in Las Vegas. Pho Sing Sing, being a Vietnamese restaurant does an okay job at it.  But we both wonder is being just okay enough?  Or does a restaurant needs to offer something special that they alone does very well to keep customers coming back for more.  That is the $150,000 question.  As for me, I will come back to check out their pho menu, but for com tam (broken rice) I already have a favorite in town.  Besides the typical Vietnamese pho restaurant menu offerings, they serve boba as well.  A-OK.  (Former location of Taiwan Kitchen)"}
{"text":"This 3 star review comes from two vastly different experiences. The food was absolutely fabulous. I'd say the food was a 4 and half star. I absolutely loved it, but the service I recieved was horrendous. I walked in and the place was pretty busy, so I'm not going to hold it against them that I had to wait for someone to approach me and seat me. that was the start, I was essentially left alone for about 10 minutes until the waitress came and took my order, at which time she brought me the water I asked for the second I entered. My food was brought out to me, and not a word was said or even a look at me. It was almost as if se didn't want to be there and I was an annoyance. While eating, it took a superhuman effort to get the waitress' attention just to get a refill on the water. It wasn't very pleasant The food, on the other hand was da B-O-M-B. I started off with the chicken wings and fish oil sauce, and needless to say it blew my socks off. The chicken was perfectly fried, and the sauce complemented it perfectly. In fact the only bad thing was that i burned my tongue because I'm too impatient to let it cool down. For my main appetizer, I decided not to get pho, but actually to try their broken rice because thats one of my favorite things. The pork was delicious and tender. I almost licked the plate clean is how good I loved it. but in the end, as much as I loved the food, the service left a bad taste in my mouth. As someone who knows how restaurants work behind the  scenes, I tend to give a little more leeway for bad service because I know waiters get busy and they are generally doing what they can. This though, was a little too much. No check to make sure everything is fine with the food, not once did she ask me if i needed more water. I understand that she had other tables and large parties, but I am still a paying customer and I still would like to feel welcomed when I go out to eat. I'm very undecided on whether or not I'll return here"}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday brunch after a long night in Vegas. Read some reviews on Yelp and thought this place would provide us with some hangover cures. Totally did not disappoint!  I had their banh canh with crab meat while my buddy had their vermicelli with shredded pork. Both dishes were amazing!  The staff members were even more amazing!  They were friendly and attentive. We even considered to come back again on Monday before heading back to la."}
{"text":"I loved this place pho was awesome taro smoothie was good as well but the service was slow no body going around filling waters . Sucks because I really wanted to love this place . Everybody was nice tho I just hate when places let that slack everybody was talking and looking at computers and tablets kinda sucks when their was only 3 tables when I was their"}
{"text":"This is the Pho restaurant that most of the Japanese people in town recommend, so I decided to try it out a few months ago and now my coworkers and I meet here regularly.   I've noticed at 2am some nights when I'm driving by Pho Sing Sing, that the lights in the kitchen are still on and someone is preparing the broth for the pho. The manager of this restaurant informed me that there is always someone around to make sure the broth is perfectly supervised. Special attention is put into the broth at Sing Sing, the type of attention that the other Pho restaurants neglect due to various reasons I will explain later. The heat that the broth is boiled in must be at a specific temperature or the taste will deviate. Sing Sing prides themselves on consistency, and makes sure that during the cooking process, the heat never exceeds or falls below the standard which produces the most quality broth. For a more bold taste, the bones still have the meat on them when boiled along with various spices such as Saigon cinnamon, ginger, and a particular secret spice recipe that Sing Sing has developed. This method of intense cooking removes any reason to put MSG into the broth. The reason why all the other pho places(most particularly Pho So 1 and Kim Long) pack their broth with MSG is because they absolutely have to in order to serve the gigantic crowds that rush in 24 hours a day. Yes, because the 24 hour Pho restaurants never close, they need to rush the cooking process or they will run out of broth. This is the reason the Pho usually tastes very weak, and to mask some of that weak taste they use MSG. Pho Sing Sing absolutely does not use MSG. But, who cares about that...Japan has used more MSG(Ajinomoto) than any other country in the world and they also happen to have one of the lowest cancer rates in the world, and they live longer than Westerners. There actually has never been any study that proves that MSG is detrimental to an individual's health. But regardless, Sing Sing does not use it at all due to the reasons I mentioned.   They serve oxtail here but you gotta come early because they sell out. The oxtail is boiled for over 20 hours, so the meat literally falls of the bone. They also give you a ton of steamed onions with it. There is nothing else like oxtail with srirachi, hoisin, and onions with your pho.   The reason why Pho comes out in less than 5 minutes at other restaurants like Pho Kim Long is because it's cooked ahead of time. That's also why all the noodles stick together. The reason why it takes a longer time here is because they cook the noodles when you order it, just like at Ramen-Yas. What I like the best about the noodles at Sing Sing is the medium-firmness from being cooked at the moment before serving.   Pho Sing Sing is the only Pho restaurant I have ever been to that actually has good service, or even service at all. I love Pho Little Saigon but after the server brings you your Pho, you never see another living person again. Same sh!t goes on at Kim Long and especially at Pho So 1.   By reading yelp reviews, it's hard to determine which Pho restaurant to go to. Like I mentioned in my \"Pho Saigon\" review, there is a \"PHO WAR\" going on between Vietnamese restaurant owners who sabotage each other's businesses with fake reviews. Also, other races of Asians tend to be ignorant of each other's cuisine. For example, Many Chinese and Koreans will complain that Miso Ramen is too salty, and Shoyu ramen is not salty enough. They don't realize that in Japan, Miso is meant to be extra salty, and Shoyu is meant to have a subtle flavor.   What I am trying to say is that every single Pho restaurant on LV yelp has a very low rating(3 stars), but that is not a reflection on how good the places really are for various reasons."}
{"text":"Came back for Bun Bo Hue, but the broth wasn't as flavorful like the first time I had it."}
{"text":"Looking to try a something new in the area when the pho craving struck. I came here with a friend who was in the mood for some bo kho.   I ordered the rare steak and brisket pho and the order came out quickly. I enjoyed my meal and the atmosphere was nice. The broth was flavorful.   The service was a little spotty but since we were chatting it wasn't to frustrating. If we were in a rush, I can see it getting on my nerves, overall I enjoyed my meal. My friend wasn't a fan of her stew and i would probably stick to their pho and vermicelli bowls in the future."}
{"text":"Delicious homemade pho recipes.  This place was a little hard to find, but the food was fresh and delicious.  I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and fantastic service!! The food was everything Pho should be and the servers were beyond excellent. They were fast, courteous, and even took custom food orders. When my friend added too much cream to her iced coffee, they brought her a replacement at no charge. The chicken wings were also so tangy and delicious!! We will visit again!"}
