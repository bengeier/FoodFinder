{"text":"Came in at lunch and the place was better then 1/2 full.
We received quick friendly service. The prices where great for the site of plates you receive.
And man where they quick after ordering the food for 4 of us was at the table in under 10 min. Hot and very tasty!
I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Better than a greasy spoon, not as healthy as other restaurants in the area. Don't order the Ceaser salad! Burger"}

{"text":"Great Food ,Really good Wait Staff Fast Service"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying Angelo's, and overall it was a great experience. The staff was friendly and the food was tasty. 
I had the Pork Souvlaki Dinner, and the meat was nice and tender. 
Also, the portion was very big, I had to save half of it for later even though I was very hungry to start with."}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive server. The Slovaki Lighter Fare was AMAZING and the spinach omelette delicious"}
{"text":"Service is slow.
Coffee refills are nonexistent.
Food was not bad from what I saw but I can't be sure as I never got my meal.
Very overpriced for breakfast.
Hard pass!"}
{"text":"Angelo's offers a wide selection of food.  Their menu includes (but are not limited to) all-day breakfast, burgers, stir-fry, sandwiches and appetizers.   Being a lover of breakfast food, I immediately went to the breakfast section.  Aside from the classics (bacon, ham, eggs, etc.), the restaurant also offers French toast, pancakes and omelettes; there are plenty  of choices to choose from!  

I settled for the Meat Lovers (pictured below), which consisted of bacon, sausage, and pea meal bacon along with three eggs, homefries, and toast.   The entire portion was generous and absolutely delicious; the eggs were cooked to perfection, the meat was not too greasy, and the homefries were perfectly seasoned with God knows what, but it was amazing.  I was satisfied after the meal and didn't feel sluggish or too full.  Definitely coming back here in the future!"}
{"text":"Now I can only really speak to the meat lovers breakfast dish (which, judging by the other reviews, seems to be one of their more popular items), but boy was it good.

The homefries were soft inside and had a nice crunch on the outside (deepfried I'm sure). The peameal bacon, which is something I've never really been a fan of, was also amazing too (kind of like it had been deepfried as well actually, but no complaints here). Anyway, it might not be the healthiest dish you'll eat all week, but it's got a solid amount of protein, will keep you full 'til dinner, and everything's brought to you with top-notch service.

They also had a few good-looking dessert items which I would have liked to try but after breakfast there was simply no room. Will definitely be back if I'm in the mood for a solid, traditional breakfast."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Angelo's today with a client.

There's quite a variety on the menu and the prices are reasonable.  My client had a chef's salad with a side of chicken breast.  She said it was good.  I had a burger with a side of fries.  The burger was good as were the fries.  I'm not a fan of fries and the only other sides were a salad or lentil soup (it didn't appeal to me). 

Service was quick and efficient.  Our order was taken within minutes of sitting down and the food was delivered very quickly.  Our server was friendly."}
{"text":"Great home style food. Great portions great variaty of different types of foods, like to  try new things on the menu all the time."}
{"text":"Fast food, but everything seems to be bagged or canned. Old diner style food.

Ordered the prime rib sandwich piled high, gravy. Too salty.  Good price for the amount of food portions huge!

Bruschetta had an odd pepper to it, not enough basil or garlic, bland. Soggy bread,

Veal with spaghetti, if u want to load up on pasta best choice, meal for days! Tomato sauce tasted jarred.

Milk shakes arent bad

They use ipads to order which is convenient.

Place looks tacky and old weird combo! Lol"}
{"text":"I went with my baby and family on Thursday and the food wasn't bad but omg the service. We finished eating breakfast and the waitress gave us our bill without asking. We asked for a second refill of coffee 4 times to 3 different waiters! To top it off my 6 month old daughter spilled a glass of water on the table and on the seat, the server saw and left a cloth on the table to clean it up ... seriously, rude.  We felt like we were being rushed and weren't being served anymore so we decided to leave. While at the front desk I noticed I didn't transfer enough money on my debit card to leave the tip on it but I had cash in my bag, so I was going to leave it on the table. Then the waitress starts saying rude sarcastic remarks and giving me the stink eye for not leaving her a tip. Like seriously, first of all we haven't left yet, second of all you don't know what I'm doing, and third of all you shouldn't even expect a tip. I ended up giving her $10 for a $40 meal to shut her up. I was so upset, she completely ruined my day. NEVER coming back to this place."}
{"text":"I had a western omelette and my wife had a. mushroom omelette for breakfast. 

Portions were ample and potatoes were delicious and hand cut bread was Texas toast and not the cheap stuff

Service was very good and the menu had a wide variety of items to choose from 

with ample parking with a Tim's and an Esso station across the street"}
