{"text":"Service was great,  after a good game. The soup provided before the burrito is super good"}
{"text":"No flavor. Rude service. And I gave it  a couple of chances. Tried their asada, beans and rice once. The second their quesadilla. Still did not manage to satisfy on the 3rd try."}
{"text":"Muy buena la comida, excelente servicio (las muchachas son muy amables y atentas), el local es pequeño pero en optimas condiciones, la carne asada es lo mejor del menu, recomendable 100%."}
{"text":"Just came to buy a burrito and paid almost $8 for a carne asada burrito, first I thought that's kind of pricey for a pinche burrito but when I got to the office and tore into it I was like damb this is really good stuff.  Well worth my hard earned cash, I will definitely be coming back. Muchisimas gracias por el super servicio en la ventanilla y más que nada una carne asada con un auténtico sabor a México.  Definitivamente regresaré !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and the staff was really friendly even at 2 in the morning. My group placed a large order that took a bit to get ready, so they gave us chips and salsa to munch on while we waited.   All the food was great and would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Favorite mexican restaurant by far. Very friendly staff. My family always picks this place when they want real mexican food. Best menudo and  tripas burritos. The area is isn't the best (27th & Indian School Road)  but the food is worth it. I will be recommending this place to all my friends."}
{"text":"I tried these guys several years ago and never left a review. Earlier in the year I started working near this run-down corner of 27th Ave and Indian School. La Korita is the shining gem in this neighborhood that is often overlooked for great food.   The staff is super friendly to my all-gringo vocabulary and I admire their hard work and dedication to traditional Mexican values in quality and service. The food is as authentic as you will get, or at least the parts of Mexico I have been to.   My favorite is their Machaca Breakfast Burrito. Machaca is super tender re-hydrated beef jerky. It is gently cooked in egg and I promise it will bring back pleasant memories of what beef used to taste like if you are over 50.   Yesterday with short notice I was able to negotiate a complete catered party order for $100 bucks saving me time, money and unhappy party animals. The food was amazing and they just made 10 new customers. Drive Thru is open all the time, enjoy."}
{"text":"Open 24/7. Close to ASU downtown. Menudo all week. Better than fili b's. Easy decision"}
{"text":"This place has to be the worst Mexican restaurant I've ever been to, the foot is mediocre at best and then they scam you with out you knowing it. They charged me $16 for a chicken chimichanga when it was $10 which in itself is ridiculous. My advice is find some where else but if you must pay with cash they can't be trusted, also the worst customer service ever."}
{"text":"Because our favorite taco place by Charlie's bar wasn't open, we came here one night to give it a go. The service was amazing. I got the beef taco plate. The Spanish rice was delicious. My bf got the carne asada fries and it was okay. I think it got too soggy with the beans on top. Overall, pretty good. 5 stars for service and flavor"}
{"text":"I've been to many Mexican restaurants in Mexico and the Southwest... This joint is clean, maintains a super friendly family operated business, and doles out amazing carne asada burritos. Their salsa rojo is to die for. If you're in the area (not the best locality), it's a must visit for some damn good Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place was so good. They had a salsa bar, with fresh ingredients, the food was amazing. They have homemade corn tortillas. I absolutely loved it. Bring your Spanish if you visit for a smoother outcome. If you don't mind spending a little bit of money, order their fajitas. You will not regret it, nor will you be able to finish your meal in one sitting."}
{"text":"Great food and service! They were very kind and are open 24 hours which is really convenient and the food is great!"}
{"text":"This place has quality food and exceptional service. I really enjoyed their torta de asada. There is a very friendly staff who makes you feel welcome and appreciated. For a nice quick authentic Mexican meal stop by Taqueria la Korita."}
{"text":"Amazing! I honestly made love to my Carne Asada burrito. The service was amazing, although spanish is definitely preferred. Great value and great quality."}
{"text":"Decent tacos. Delivery guy kinda took a while. Uber eats is very convenient. I was just too hungry to wait. Keep it up guys! Awesome job."}
{"text":"I ordered a drink, a burrito and two tacos. I got a burrito and one taco. I had to ask for my drink about 3 times and had to return to the restaurant for another damn taco.  Besides that she charges me for the nore expensive tacos when I asked for the small ones. She even assured me that the price on the screen was accurate. Service is TERRIBLE. Food was good. It was cold by the time we ate it and it didn't take us long to get home. Only reason you should go here is if you're pregnant and have a craving for decent Mexican food and bad service at 4 am. Or if you go when they make it fresh."}
{"text":"Just one of those things. How I ended up here, it just ended up that way? It was early, was more hungry then usual. Didn't have time to get a bowl of cereal at home. So on my way to work I was deciding whether I should stop somewhere to grab a bite or just get to work. The closer I got to work the more I was talking myself into grabbing something to eat. So, I seen this little place. Had a 24/7 sign lit up. AT 6:00 AM, there isn't many choices to grab something.  So I pulled into the drive through. I really wasn't that impressed with the breakfast burrito selection. They only had three? Machaca, Bacon and Eggs, and Chorizo. I was going to order the Machaca, but I was more in the mood for Chili Verde. So I asked if I can order off the menu, I asked if they can make me a Chili Verde and Egg burrito?  Note: When I was a little hombre and visited my grandparents in Arizona. Grandma fed us chili verde all the time. Growing up in the years, chili verde was my favorite meal and to this day it still is. Now back to the review! So after asking them for the request, they said no problem. And of course I added my 6:00 AM diet coke with the meal.  First, the burrito is a very decent size. I took the meal to my office. They wrap the burrito in a foil so it was still very hot when I started eating it. Kind of funny, their chili verde actually reminded me of how my grandmother use to make hers! It was very good. Had a nice kick, was to soggy, and had plenty of pork. I like two kind of chili verde. My mothers, which is more mild but explodes with flavor. And my Grandmothers, which has a nice kick but still have enough flavor.  I was diffidently surprised by this place. Did not expect how good their chili verde was. They were very nice to allow me to order off the menu. Very gracious about this and will come back to dine in at a later day."}
{"text":"I ordered a carne asada quesadilla which was actually good BUT the service was so unorganized. I ordered at the drive thru speaker. Although I could barely hear her she did repeat my order back and told me to come to the window. When I pulled up to the window I waited a few minutes and a lady opened the window. I tried to hand her my debit card and she gave me a confused look and said \"do you need something? \" I said \"yes I just ordered. \" She said \"You ordered over the phone?\" And I said \"No, I just ordered at the drive thru. She asked what I ordered and closed the window for literally 10 mins. I was just getting ready to drive off and she opened the window to get my payment. Of course after I paid, I was pretty much obligated to wait for the food so about 5 mins later she finally opens the window and gives me my food. This was at 4:45pm on a Wednesday and there were no cars in the lot and no other cars in the drive thru for the whole transaction so I'm not sure what the hold up was but I probably won't be back with so many other options in the area."}
{"text":"This place is a little piece of Monterrey Mexico right in the heart of Phoenix. Great food, amazing customer service all the way around! The chicken burrito is delicious with some of the best beans I've ever tasted. It's not about fancy decor here just good Mexican food."}
{"text":"If it's open 24 hours think twice, I should of.   Ordered the chilaquiles and they included the food poisoning free!  Don't mind the bloody gut, that's your immune system getting stronger!"}
{"text":"The food is good but service is crap. The lady who usually takes the orders is nice but the kitchen staff needs help. I go in today and order a chicken quesadilla and it took 25 minutes no lie. A lady came in ten minutes after me and got her huge meal first, then when I asked for my money back and to forget the quesadilla they tell the kitchen lady to make it, twice. . . I wait and wait and wait.... then they tell the kitchen lady I'm mad. Yes I'm mad. That it took 25 minutes for a quesadilla when there was only one customer who came in AFTER me."}
{"text":"Everything is great about this place, nice staff, lady up in the front was very helpful and recommended me to try out the fries custom ordered and turned out really good."}
{"text":"La mejor comida mexicana en Phoenix 100% recomendado la carne de mis tacos asada a las brasas todo delicioso y el servicio excelente muy limpio el lugarcito vuelvo mañana y todos los días!!"}
{"text":"They do have good food! I've had a carne asada burrito, carne asada chips, numerous tacos, I just think that this place is too high priced for the area. It's not like it's in the Biltmore District where rent is higher, this is right on the hoe stroll! Come man, your prices are out of line with the venue, then on top of that, you want to charge me to use my debit card?!?!   Isn't odd that my hubby only come in when we have no food at home, so we hit y'all up!   Let us know if your going, maybe we could roll up together"}
{"text":"Muy buena comida, excelente sabor y calidad. Los burritos y tacos son de los mejores de Arizona y la atención es muy buena. Lo recomiendo sin duda alguna."}
{"text":"The food at this place is great. The lady that works at night, her name Elisa , she by far has the best customer Service skills, I hope she gets paid a lot if not hope you see this and decide to pay her more. Every time I come she always is extremely helpful and extremely kind and makes Every visit a great one ."}
{"text":"These are the best tacos I have had here in PHX since moving from LA. I love the salsa bar with all the choices they have. The manager is great she is always there to make sure you're having the best food at all times."}
{"text":"From the charismatic love you receive to the excellent service, this is by far the neighborhood eats that are always convenient to imbibe upon. 24 hours a day and Jessica is a pleasure for gringos to speak with.   Did I mention the food was amazing.  I'll definitely be returning...   La Rasa!!!"}
{"text":"Taqueria La Korita has some of the best Mexican food in the west valley. The customer service is amazing and the quality of the food is high. You should definitely try it if you're on this side of town and if you're not, then making the drive is worth it."}
{"text":"Not bad, a little dry, but tastey. If it was in a better part of town it would be very busy, but as it is, it's still a good place for a quick bite. The staff was helpful and courtesy, and knew their menu. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Holy sh*t this place is 24hrs?!! honestly is a gem! I'm from California and I usually visit of Phoenix often so I usually to look to Yelp for good places to eat. Now there's loads of Mexican joints within a mile radius and I've tried to go where the locals go...damn did I hit the spot! I am currently eating their food and I felt compelled to write them a review right now actually since they deserve the recognition. I'm gonna be honest, the extremely nice woman at the counter was helpful and she aided me through using the $5 for $10 deal (which is an absolute steal!) She did however try to get me to write a review after I used the coupon right then and there but I had to try the food first and I am not disappointed at all! Honestly, my first bite into their al pastor taco was some of the best I've ever had. A waft of that sweet pineapple and its sweetness marinating their meat is something that's definitely gonna have me running back before I leave. I had also gotten a shrimp taco which was delicious as well. I'd have to say the huge plus about it would the the amount of shrimp they actually put in the in it. Lastly, I had their carne asada burrito which I can tell it is grilled carne asada cut into chunks since I can still taste the tinge from the grill itself! This wowed me the most and the size of it was quite generous considered I had the beans on the side. The beans also had such a nice texture to it, it was almost like it's half mashed so not mushy and it definitely isn't your traditional refried beans.  I am definitely coming back here when I'm in town! Their salsa bar is legit, literally everything I've been hoping for since I've visited AZ!"}
{"text":"I've had a chorizo breakfast burrito and the enchiladas rojas here. Both were quite good and seemed pretty authentic. Waiting staff was nice and funny. Not a great neighborhood but if you are around this is a good place for a cheap meal."}
{"text":"Big ass burritos and a bomb salsa bar. Kicks it over a bertos any day. The salsa verde is a must try, watch out though as some are pretty spicey!"}
{"text":"Muy rico, consomé torta papas fritas y jamaica  lugar chico y tranquilo, la limpieza es muy aceptable a pesar del entorno. La porción es suficiente y económico el problema fue que en el vaso de jamaica tenia mas de la mitad de hielo y olvidaron una parte del pedido"}
{"text":"I would give a four star for quality, but its so expensive for a 24hr Mexican spot. It already starts at $7 for a carne asada burrito that only has onions and rice. Literally wanted to add 1.50 for cheese and 1.50 for beans to a burrito! Dollar a piece max and I better be getting my money's worth at that price. Just said forget them. 2 dollars for a Mexican soda is typical. Charged 50 cents to use a cc. They are very slow, even when there's nobody there, so don't go in a hurry. When the burrito came out, it looked decent sized as its a long burrito. But I felt like the burrito I got was more tortilla then filling. The steak was very good, rice was good, the salsas were good. Problem is I know I could have gotten a better deal at several other places. I17 was blocked off or I'd have ate closer to home. Was stuck in the area and it was closest. So, If you're in the area, have time, and don't mind spending too much, eat here. If any of those three are a no, you have your answer."}
{"text":"I needed (yes needed) some mexican food. This place was on the way home and totally satisfied my craving. I got the carne asada burrito and was not disappointed at all. The only reason I am giving it three stars is because of the service.   It took three people in the drive through to take my order. The guy on the speaker in the drive through came on speaking Spanish so I ordered in Spanish (I'm fluent, besides carne asada burrito is not difficult to say whether you speak Spanish or not) Then he told me to hold on or come to the window (in English). Then when I got to the window and he saw I wasn't a native speaker, he grabbed some one else to speak to me in English. Then another person came to the window to explain to me what would be coming inside the burrito (like it's rocket science).   Never felt so insulted before. And there is no need for me to return. There's plenty of other  competition to explore in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The cashier was friendly & knowledgable. The food was good a bit pricey for fast food.  I had the chilaquiles they were dry not enough sauce.  My husband had the red menudo it was tasty. She gave us a taste of the red mole sauce it was good. As we were leaving a customer got a plate that looked yummy. We are going to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Wonderful all around! Not the best neighborhood but you definitely get great food to make up for it. My friend was in town and staying at a local motel and he wanted to meet here as it was close by. When we walked in, the server offered us a taste of their cucumber water which we promptly ordered because it was so delicious! It was Taco Tuesday and we got great deals on dollar fifty tacos that were filled with great ingredients! I can't say good nothing's about this place. You will find all sorts of good, well priced Mexican food here!"}
{"text":"Place seemed friendly,  all good. But I didn't like the burrito. It was lamer then a 90 yr olds kneecaps. Beans were watered down in my burrito. It just ruined my appetite. I wanted to just leave it and roll out but I finished It because I paid for it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican spots in AZ! Just down the street from my house and open 24 hours! $1 Taco Tuesdays!!!! Great food and customer service! Always good on amount of meat you are served! Only thing is the area it's in (not the best)"}
{"text":"Amazing food made here with intent to showcase homemade Mexican food. Cabeza torta is amazing, bean burrito, lengua taco and verde chile plato were all amazing.   The service is so great from a smiling waitress.the manager came out to chat and see how our food was.   The free soup served upfront was really unique and tasty. Choose the red salsa to add a kick."}
