{"text":"The food portions are horrible for the money you pay for lunch. They went up on the prices and the portions gotten smaller. The seafood lunch special was 14.99 to only get 2 pieces of small shrimp, 4 baby scallops, 3 baby nail  pieces of lobster. They give you more vegetables than anything and you dont even get a cup of fried rice. Poor quality food, poor quality service and the customer service manager sucks. She is rude and mean when you tell her about the portions of the food. I wouldn't recommend nobody to this restaurant and they need to be closed down. Its even nasty in there. Dirty unclean carpet."}
{"text":"I grew up in Beachwood and went to the Samurai restaurant all the time as a kid. Now the Samurai is a Benihana, and I moved to Willoughby Hills. I tried Yukiho restaurant and really like it.  First of all, it is located in a little strip mall at the intersection of SOM and Euclid Avenues.  Turn into the mall and drive straight to TJ Maxx.  Turn right and it is the last space in the mall.  I ordered the chicken and shrimp combo meal. They came with a small salad, soup, fried rice and cooked veggies. The meal was very similar to Benihana but at half the price. I loved the food and will be back regularly."}
{"text":"Pretty nice restaurant and change of atmosphere than the larger crowds at wasabi or similar restaurants. Food was tasty and will visit again!"}
{"text":"They have now skimped on everything, even the sauce, even the rice, even the appetizers (they literally give you babyfood portions), even the air. They don't even do the fire in front of you anymore and they cut the show short on the lil baby volcano. BS! I want the old Yukiho back :/"}
{"text":"Amazing little Japanese place... they excel in hibachi... the gentleman who does the grill is quite skilled... Sushi is okay to good..."}
{"text":"Loved this place for years! Does not get enough recognition. It's better than most of the \"popular\" hibachi places in the area. The workers are sweet and you don't have to wait very long for anything. Also, the food is delicious and reasonably priced. I always get the chicken and shrimp hibachi combo and I always ask for more of their sweet white sauce which is addicting. I recommend Yukiho to all my friends!"}
{"text":"So yummy ! Me and my family have been coming here for years ! All the staff is so nice and the food is so good !"}
{"text":"I don't think this place gets as much attention and recognition as it deserves. We've been here twice and enjoyed it both times. No the decor is a little lacking but the food is decent and it's a great value. The staff is friendly. I'm giving only 4 stars because it was a while before we were greeted and our drink orders were taking on our last visit. But we were greeted and seated as soon as we walked in. This place doesn't seem very busy but I say it's worth it. 2 hibachi dinners and a Mai tai that came in a pint sized glass for $35 you can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Old, dirty, no atmosphere, food is just ok, seems like the staff doesn rg care about making money. Was probably an estate deal and just gives them some pocket change. Could be so much more. But you can't make people want!"}
