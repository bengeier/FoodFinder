{"text":"I go here once a week. I dream about it...the food is so delicious. Also, what a bargain for $5. Kind, accurate service, fresh everything. No aftertaste. I feel so good for the rest of the day after eating here. Best kept secret downtown!"}
{"text":"This is one of the top five things I miss about working downtown, along with the main library, Teahouse Noodles, Vincenza's and walking to do errands.  I will confess that the special brown rice with chicken is my favorite. Brown rice, chicken, peanuts, veggies and a really tasty sauce add up to a fantastic lunch.  The owner is quite kind and affable and has a strong emphasis on customer service.  You can get a really great lunch here for about $6."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! You need to have cash though, so be prepared. This is one of my favorite lunch spots. Cheap in price but excellent quality - food made to order, food made to order...I had to say it twice. The man at the counter (need to ask what his name is next time) who takes the orders is very nice. There are daily specials that you may order any day - a bonus in my opinion especially if this is your first visit. I wish I lived closer, I would visit more often.  The place is located downstairs in the old Arcade, so the seating is cafeteria style if you choose to eat there."}
{"text":"This is one of the best food counters downtown. The portions are generous with vegetables, and the price is right, at $5 per dish. Try the \"curry\" which is actually a Singapore noodle dish."}
{"text":"Before my company moved to the Flats, this place had been my favorite lunch spot for about 2 years. It's cheap, fast and delicious for the price you pay. Doubling the meat for 99c is a steal."}
{"text":"Inexpensive food prepared extremely fast and provided with exceptionally friendly service."}
{"text":"I just ate Zen for the second time and they just keep it consistent. The food is very good, very fresh and comes very fast. And excellent lunch choice for the downtown crowd Monday thru Friday. And the prices are very good. You can lunch for under $5 if you just get a water. The service at the counter is very good, very polite and friendly.  I would recommend Zen for anyone looking for a real good lunch in the downtown area. They are in the Arcade almost under the stairs.  Be prepared, it is cafeteria style seating shared with other resturants so don't expect linen tables cloth.  As was stated in other review CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Vegetarians beware!  Prior to today I would have had nothing but positive things to say about this place. Very inexpensive and very good tasting food. Can't be beat.  The guy normally at the counter wasn't there so I placed my order with one of the ladies in the kitchen. I specified (as I always do) that I wanted tofu.  Now I am not bashing this place because she got the order wrong and made it with chicken instead.  None of us are perfect and that is an acceptable mistake.  What made me upset is that when they finally gave me my meal they had obviously just picked out the chicken and stirred in some tofu. They did a poor job of it too as there were at least five pieces of chicken still in it. I am not a vegetarian but I used to be so I understand that as a vegetarian you DO NOT WANT CHICKEN served with your tofu. Honestly if I had to wait five more minutes for them to just remake it properly I would have still given them a five star review. When a place takes a shortcut like this I simply cannot spend my money there anymore."}
{"text":"Wow, can't believe for as long as I've worked downtown, I've never visited Zen Cuisine!   I visited today for the first time and I will absolutely return.  I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken, which was cooked to order, with nice crunchy bean sprouts, and other veggies with white rice.  The portion was very generous, and tasty, especially for $4.59!   I learned while waiting for my order that they also offer brown rice and wheat udon noodles, I'll remember that next time.  The gentleman taking orders was SUPER nice.  I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This small, unassuming stand on the bottom floor of The Arcade (and hidden around the stairs in the food court area) uses some of the best and freshest ingredients you will find among restaurants in its class.  The dishes are made-to-order and generally leave you feeling much better than your usual (oily) mall Chinese fare.  On top of that, the gentleman behind the counter taking orders is extremely nice and is definitely focused on giving his customers a positive experience.  The food is fairly inexpensive:  The brown rice with chicken and a can of Diet Pepsi (along with a free styrofoam cup of ice) will run you $7.07.  More often than not, he pulls the extra 7-cents out of his own tip jar (I told you he was nice), so be sure to return the favor at some point with your own generosity.  The menu is pretty basic:  Your typical meat and rice (or noodle) combinations and also some noodle soups.  Also, all of the daily specials shown on the signs behind the counter are available every day.  As for downsides, if you can't get a table along the main walkway, the drab back area of The Arcade isn't exactly an inspiring area to eat lunch, but there is plenty of space available.  As others have mentioned, Zen Cuisine is cash only.  Finally, while the ingredients are remarkably fresh, I think the overall taste (and particularly with the teriyaki chicken) lags behind my current downtown Chinese lunch favorite, Master Wok in Tower City."}
{"text":"Great food, and the price is right!  All of their food is from local farms, and they have a variety of options.  They have daily specials, but you can order them any day of the week (they don't mind!)  Everything is made to order and tastes incredibly fresh.   Warning - Cash only!"}
{"text":"Fresh food, nice owner, and great price!  Super option for a healthier lunch in Cleveland.  I feel good supporting this business."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last week with some coworkers.  The food was fresh and really good. I liked the variety of available options, from rice dishes to noodle dishes. The prices are very reasonable.  I will return!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and excellent service!  This place is an absolute treasure and I will be back. They offer brown and white rice- I got the teriyaki shrimp. The sauce was light and sweet- very good and the vegetables were fresh and retained some crispness- not at all over cooked like a lot of places. I enjoyed my meal and the proprietor said of you want something not on the menu just ask! They may have it anyway or can make it. Best lunch I've had in a while :-)"}
{"text":"It is located at the lower level, to the right of the stairs of the Euclid entrance in the Arcade.   Service is friendly,  food is of good quality. Portion is relative small. Plenty of seats available nearby."}
{"text":"I love it here. It is not gourmet, but everything I have had is delicious. I always get the vegetable noodle soup bowl with tofu because it is only $5, big portion and its healthy. The guy running the place is always kind, patient  and moves the busy lunch line quickly. Just remember to bring cash"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots downtown. Their noodle soups are inexpensive ($4.99 for my chicken), tasty, and healthy, and the portion sizes are generous. Also offered are rice dishes and \"daily specials\" (everything is available every day at the same price, so I they're not really specials). Service is fast and friendly. They also use locally raised chicken, a nice touch. If you work or are visiting downtown, I recommend it. It's in the lower level of the Old Arcade, so it takes some poking around to find, but the food and getting to ogle the Arcade while you're eating are worth it."}
{"text":"This is one of the best lunch spots downtown for take-out! I love their focus on healthy ingredients, a rarity for a food court establishment.   Once, I could see into the back kitchen, and saw these sweet elderly ladies chopping up piles of colorful produce - this was in stark contrast to  the deep fryers and greasy grills in other Arcade eateries.  The food is simply wonderful!! I love the noodle soup. The broth is miso-based (perfect for vegetarians) and has lots of delicious buckwheat noodles and fresh vegetables. The fried rice with tofu is also delicious.  Two things really stand out to me about this place, other than the healthfulness of its delicious food:   1. It is REALLY inexpensive. I think the fried rice (a big portion) is only about $3, and the soup is $5 or less.  2. The owner is one of the kindest people I have ever met. He isn't overly friendly or chatty, but just seems to be a person of great humility and character.   His is the kind of business downtown that I really root for. I hope anyone who finds themselves near the Arcade for lunch will give this a shot."}
{"text":"It's in the arcade under the stairs. I went here twice while visiting CLE and both times it was decent. The prices are great, and the food was fresh and tasty. They have daily specials for $4.99. They were also very friendly =)"}
{"text":"Okay I liked this place way more than I thought I would.   Healthy Cantonese cuisine? ....but why she asks?   In fact this place doesn't self-proclaim to be healthy, but you can see from all their offerings that they are a notch above what you'd expect from a food court Chinese stand. Whole wheat noodles, brown rice, fresh vegetables.... it's everything your friendly neighborhood Chinese takeout restaurant isn't, and in a very good way. Their menu is very simple, basically just a rice option and a noodle soup option, along with their daily specials.   I have to give a shoutout to the gentleman working the front at this place, I think Jennifer W. describes him well; he's humble, patient and kind. I wouldn't describe him as overly friendly, but he offers the best kind of customer service in my opinion. Once you see him you'll know exactly what I mean.   As for the food, it's not overly flavorful. It isn't really truly Cantonese for this reason, but I love that the meals here are filling without being overly greasy or heavy.... and for FIVE DOLLARS. How could you possibly beat that? I actually didn't even think there was a place in the city where you could get a tasty, filling and nutritious meal for that cheap.   I ordered the noodle soup with chicken and it was perfect. The broth was quite mild, nothing too flavorful, but also not overloaded with MSG. The best part were the oh-so-crunchy vegetables... snap peas, green onions, even julienned cucumber along with tender pieces of white meat chicken. I truly think you can't go wrong here. I only wish that they weren't cash only, but really it's hard to complain when almost all their lunch specials are $4.99."}
