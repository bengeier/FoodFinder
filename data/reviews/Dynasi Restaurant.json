{"text":"Great place to go for breakfastpancakes, cooked breakfasts, coffee. Friendly staff and cater well for children. You may need to book during busy periods but I've never had a problem getting a table. Plenty of parking out front and seats a good number inside."}
{"text":"The glory days are gone. The place is now tired and worn. Even the sign is broken and sagging. Very average all day breakfast. Terrible coffee. The whole place reeked of industrial cleaner which made enjoying breakfast difficult. I ate fast and got out of there. The owners are finally selling out to developer and they stopped caring years ago."}
{"text":"Friendly little breakfast diner. Fantastic food, affordable price, and excellent service. Lots of parking space, and lots of room inside. The decor is a bit old-fashioned, but it adds to the atmosphere of the place, which is quite comfortable altogether. The location is a bit remote, making it one of Oakville's best kept secrets!"}
{"text":"Fabulous and unpretentious family restaurant!  The friendly servers are fast and attentive - even better than some high-end spots. Portions are huge and tasty. I had the Monte Cristo, which is like a French toast sandwich with smoked ham and cheese inside. It was served with a generous helping of homefries. Yay, homefries!!"}
{"text":"Dead atmosphere, limp everything, in attentive service with no customers as an excuse. It was cheap-ish, and I still felt robbed."}
{"text":"This is your classic greasy spoon breakfast that's being swallowed- up by the rapidly developing North Oakville.  It provides simple, un-complicated family-friendly food that leaves both your belly and your wallet full.

Nothing about the french toast, pancakes or waffles really \"wows\" but you don't go there to be \"wowed\", you go there for an uncomplicated, no-frills meal."}
{"text":"Personally, I do not like this place. Some rave about it, I find it a real greasy spoon and the quality of the food poor. But that's me.

I get stuck coming here with a group sometimes for work and the one fussy guy in the group who likes his food to not have any taste, really likes the place.

Go figure."}
