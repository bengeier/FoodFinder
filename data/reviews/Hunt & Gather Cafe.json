{"text":"We were welcomed as soon as we walked in.  We ordered Chicken wings.... 10 chicken wings and boy were they fabulous.  Ordered the Cuban Sandwich.  Great great great sandwich with Garlic fries.  So nice to have this place in the neighborhood.  Give a try..."}
{"text":"My best friend and I decided to try something new Friday night, so we stopped into \"Hunt and Gather\" and what a TREAT!!!! Not only was the service phenomenal, but the food was healthy and amazing!  We had the chicken screwers and the chicken and rice bowl with pico and plantains. . .  And the combination of flavors in both plates was perfect!!!  Not only will we be going back weekly, we will also be sharing our experience with friends. Thank you Mida for your wonderful hospitality!"}
{"text":"This place kills.  The food is totally under priced.  I told them so.  The 10$ pizza? Wow.  The 10$ burger.  One of the best I have eaten.  The girls, owners, are really fun.  Just try it."}
{"text":"You need the Hunt & Gather Café CUBANO SANDWICH in your mouth RIGHT NOW! STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING. This was the best Cuban sandwich I've ever had. PASTRAMI ON MY CUBAN! My prayers have been answered! I got one on my way out of town and was totally blown away. The seasoned fries were also spectacular... some of the best I've had in Vegas. I used to live around the corner for about 10 years, long before there was any shopping center, and I have to say that every time I go back, something new, surprising and good quality has popped up in that area. Hunt & Gather Café is a great new addition to the restaurant scene in Centennial Hills and I'll be back again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place is the best kept secret in Vegas!  Amazing food, great atmosphere, eclectic music selection, terrific service.  I had the Cuban sandwich, which had just the right amount of pickles.  My husband got the Guinness carnitas, which totally melted in your mouth!  We went with another couple; he got the special - a burger made with venison and chorizo and topped with a fried egg - WOW!  She got a smoked turkey leg and friend plantains.  Oh, and we had fried frog legs as an appetizer - divine!  If you're in the north, this is a must, and if you're not, make the trip.  Will definitely be back often."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!! The Cubano sandwich goes hard!  Good to pickup. Atmosphere needs some work."}
{"text":"Service is really good but couldn't make me go back because the food was not very good. I was super confused by the atmosphere & menu. It's like one person came up with the decor & name, and another person was in charge of the menu. So strange!!   As far as the food...dissapointed is a pretty good way to describe it. I had high hopes after reading on the to-go menu that \"they\" were vetrens to the service industry. The burrito was big, but pretty sure the sauce is from a can (yuck, I might as well have made it then), no flavor on the chicken and was mostly cold.   The salmon sliders were so-so. But I could have easily whipped up grilled salmon and onions on a toasted slider bun myself. The side dish of corn was chard and hard. Two bites were enough for me. As a former server, I would have defiantly inquired why it was uneaten and offered a replacement. But, hey I guess that comes with expierence!  And lastly the $3 corn soup...pretty sure it made me sick for the rest of the day!   That's the 4th restraunt in that same location & they are gonna really need good food to keep the doors open. There are too many good places to spend your money, hope they pull it together soon. Wish them luck, but we won't be back for seconds!"}
{"text":"Everything we have tried so far is amazing. The food is fresh from scratch and DELICIOUS!!!!!  Love to come here with friends and family."}
{"text":"The food and service at Hunt and Gather Cafe is fantastic. I have ordered different things from the menu each time I have been there, and each time the food has been fabulous. On Valentine's Day my husband and I each ordered the ribeye steak and both of our steaks were outstanding....the best that I have ever had in the 40 years that I have lived in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with my wife and two four year olds while waiting for a business to open. Very pleasantly surprised! You can't tell much from the outside but the food is really exceptional. Had the burrito which was outstanding and my wife the \"Cubuffalo\" that she really  loved. Even the kids meals were a hit which is rare. I hope they stick around because we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I got the grilled tacos with chicken and they were awesome. Lots of deliciousness and nice and spicy. The sangria was also am-ah-zing!! Went here on a Saturday afternoon and it was empty, so it was nice to study"}
{"text":"Had the Cuban sandwich along with the spinach dip and both were fantastic! The wine selection is limited but very good! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I dined here last night. I live nearby and am always hoping to get a great neighborhood restaurant. It's finally here!!! Please check this place out. The decor is simple, it could definitely use some more, to spice it up, but the food was perfect. I wasn't that hungry and ate my entire plate because it was so good! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Quality of food is just crap. Customer service is terrible as well. Upon walking inside, there was no greeting. The waitress seemed preoccupied and was rushing everything. On top of the horrible customer service, the food was lackluster. I do not recommend eating here"}
{"text":"I just went there for lunch with my brother, and it was delicious! We had a great experience there and the service was very good. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it was a bit of a long wait for the food and the music was really loud. Nonetheless, we had an excellent experience and I cannot wait to share it with friends & family!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  We had the Cubano and Dominicano sandwiches. The sandwiches were cooked well and perfectly seasoned. The cooking skill really showed through, with flavorful bread and meats melding perfectly.  We also had the spinach humus. The pita bread was cooked like a Cubano adding mountains of flavor. The humus itself had an interesting mix of spices. The spinach leaves should have been pureed into the humus, as it takes away from the texture, but this was a minor gripe.  Excellent new restaurant I would recommend a visit."}
{"text":"So I have to start by saying that I think they either had their friends and family write these reviews or paid people to do it.  Lets start with the restaurant itself.  Its the old location of Verdi's Pizza. Which Iwish never left because they had the best deal on pizza! But Hunt and Gather changed it up a bit.  The environment is ok.  Its relaxing. But can definitely use some upgrading.  The menu..oh my gosh! ok so I understand the name of the restaurant is \"Hunt and Gather\" but really! the menu is all over the place! They have ribs, pizza, Mexican, Dominican, I didn't know what type of food was their specialty.  The look of the menu was very irritating!  I know they just opened and may have a few hiccups that need to be adjusted but man! Looking at the menu made me want to get up and leave.  Now for the important part; the FOOD! I ordered the burrito that is covered in enchilada sauce and my boyfriend order the tacos. we both got the steak and not the chicken... Now what most people usually complain about is not having enough meat.ppssshhh... here! they give way too much meat I want to throw up! I couldn't even finish my food. my boyfriend said his tacos were deccent, but upset that the tortillas wasn't big enough to hold all the meat. we literally had all the meat outside our tortillas. the flavor for the burrito was a 5 out of 10. with way toooooo much cheese on top. I felt my arteries getting clogged.  so would I ever come bac? maybe in a year to see what has changed. maybe..."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!! I don't think I could say enough good about this place!! From the awesome, friendly, curtious, and wonderful staff to the amazing, delicious, flavorful food!! I got the cucumber delight salad; it was light and fresh tasting I loved it!! I also got el burrito; huge and spicy!! Will definitely be returning as often as possible!!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit and I was very disappointed. I had the mammoth burger..it was dry, grainy, and lacked flavor. The bun was great...garlic fries were so-so. My husband had the burrito...it was dry and tasteless. Service was good and the sandwich I had on my first visit was much better. Prices are too high for a third try."}
{"text":"Service was great! And the food is delicious! Fantastic selection of a variety of dishes!"}
{"text":"Saw the review on yelp thought we would give it a try, I must say they lived up to the reputation.  My husband had the Libre Cubano which was delicious I kept taking bites of it.  Sweet Potato fries the best I have had in a long time.  Spinach salad was fresh and filling.  And don't forget the sangrias, the reason we came, spot on!  We can't wait to come back and try the pizza."}
{"text":"If you want great food and great company, a chill ambiance and refreshing brews, come here! My husband and I feel at home when we eat and hang out here. The menu has a variety of food to choose from and their specials are always a hit! My husband and I go and want to try everything on the menu (because everything we have ordered so far is yummy!) so we order different things to share and we leave satisfied each time. Some of my food recommendations: turkey burger, wings, calamari, Thai salad, consome soup, pollo con arroz, fried plantains, Cuban sandwich, pizza (the one with carnitas as a topping! The Huntsman). There are just so many things!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and terrific hostess. Had the the philly steak and cheese, which came w/ side salad. Total w tip: $16 and some coins. I wouldn't recommend it. For that price, esp when considering what kind of philly s&c you can get at other place for that price, there wasn't nearly enough meat on it - ea bite was lots of bread/little pieces of meat. The salad was tasty, but it was offered on the same plate as the philly and the ranch dressing ran & soaked into the bread ...now, I do like ranch, but I prefer just mayo on my philly. I'll go back one day to give it another try (as some of their food pics and descriptions look and sound very inviting), BUT, I'll nvr have their philly again.....unless, that is, the significantly overhaul it.   Stopped by 29 Sep"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I've nearly tried everything on the menu in the last year and have LOVED every single menu item!! In addition, I've referred multiple friends and every one has enjoyed the food as well!!"}
{"text":"Always fantastic food!  Very friendly atmosphere, feel like part of the Hunt & Gather family each time we eat there, it's great.  Never have to wait for a drink refill, but not so attentive that you feel interrupted, highly recommend this H&G!"}
{"text":"This being my second visit, it was my intention to capture a photo of the delicious Cuban sandwich and fries. I failed to get a picture during my first visit, for some (un)known reason.  (Un)Fortunately, it all vanished again before I could snap the pic. *See Check-in photo*    'Nough said!"}
{"text":"Good little place to eat for the whole family. If you want Mexican and something wants pasta. You can have both. And your kids can have pizza as well. They only have beer and wine but priced reasonable"}
{"text":"A quaint little cafe in the area. Service was excellent. Super friendly and helpful waitress.   We had the Cubano sandwich, grilled steak tacos and kids pizzas. Also started with the spinach dip with pita. The dip was the best I have had in a long time. Even my kids ate it despite the spinach!   The pizza was awesome with good quality cheese spread heavily over it.   The tacos had so much flavor that I demolished the dish.   The Cubano didn't disappoint.   Definitely recommend trying this hidden gem."}
{"text":"The story of two waitresses that one day opened their own restaurant.  In this economy no bank would give them a business loan yet their dream lived on.  They did not come from affluent nor wealthy families.  Yet these two women went against all odds and realized their dream of opening Hunt and Gather.  With the influences of Caribbean and Latin American backgrounds they have blended flavors,  and styles.   I've enjoyed the rib eye,  cooked to perfection,  toasty on the outside pink on the inside.   Arroz con pollo,  very Caribbean. Good!   The guiness carnitas flavorful and smoky.  Let Ignacia know about gluten sensitivities and she can accommodate some of her dishes to fit your needs.  The gluten free pizzas are amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow. This place blew every expectation we had. It was a Saturday night and we were the only couple in the place. So naturally service was outstanding, but even if it was busy, I imagine it would still be great.  We started with a few beers, then got the elk sausage. It was smokey, spicy, juicy and just the right texture. I had the \"Pack a Punch\" salmon slider. It was the best fish sandwich I've ever eaten. Again, perfectly smoked salmon that was salted soooo well, topped with tasty onions. I almost licked my plate clean. My GF had the Philly and it was equally great.  The elk sausage and salmon slider combined with a HUGE mug of Moose Drool Brown Ale is something I will try to have every time I'm back in Vegas.  This place was unreal and really a surprise to see it so empty in a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Excellent variety of food, there's something here for everyone. Try the yucca fries. I've heard great things about the Cuban sandwich, but I haven't tried it yet. I'm glad I stumbled upon this place!"}
{"text":"Love the wide choices of food. Great selection of healthy items also. A lap good size TV's to watch sports"}
{"text":"Stopped in at the Hunt and Gather Cafe today off the whisper that a fantastic Cuban sandwich could be found here. I was greeted immediately upon walking in, offered a seat and asked about a drink. The drink was served in a mason jar with an iron handle for a type of rustic look.  The establishment was clean throughout and well maintained. NFL network and other sports related channels were on every tv screen accompanied by upbeat music.  The menu had much more than I anticipated. Plenty of venison based dishes as well as a fantastic array of Spanish dish choices.  The Cuban sandwich I ordered was amazing! Much larger than I had expected and with a good portion of garlic fries on the side. The taste I was expecting for the sandwich was spot on and very fresh. All in all, I had a fantastic experience at the hunt and gather cafe."}
{"text":"Exceptional food. Frogs legs? Yum! The corn chowder was super tasty, as was the sangria. My friend had the Cubano and said it was awesome. I had the carnitas torta. Also, very good. I think it was just missing a tangy sauce to accent the meat. Maybe a flavored aioli, instead of just mayo, or a fresh made salsa. Garlic fries were good, would've liked a bit more garlic. Overall, really great hidden gem. Eclectic menu that was very high quality. Would like to try brunch sometime."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here. The Cuban sandwich is the best in town. We tried the venison tacos and they were absolutely amazing! If you're looking for good food that is different from everything else being served in town, come check this place out. This is going to be one of our regular stops now."}
{"text":"Places like this are rare in Vegas...  Small restaurant with a delicious variety of dishes.   The Cuban was amazing.   The Cajun chicken Alfredo was buttery and creamy!!!  You have to try the spinach dip."}
{"text":"Nice new place to dine. Friendly folk and a LOCAL business come support them. I should have finished this review off a couple months ago. The hummus is great and the food we have was very good quality."}
{"text":"We saw all the great reviews on Yelp and decided to try it, since finding a decent place so close to home would be fantastic!  Well, it was good.. not great, but not bad. Now for the breakdown:  Ambiance.. really, there isn't any. Nothing on the walls but some color and a couple of tvs showing the same sports channel. No moose head, despite what someone else posted. Not a single poster, print, etc. Seats were comfy enough, and we had our choice as nobody else was there when we arrived (8ish on a Monday night).  Our server was great.. cheerful, prompt, friendly - no issues there.  Prices were good, we ate an appetizer & two meals for about $40.  Now for the main event, the food, since that's what a restaurant is about:  First, we ordered drinks.. a Sangria for hubby and a Pepsi for me. Hubby said the Sangria was fantastic. I can tell you that the Pepsi was just that, not as good as a Coke but what can you do? ;)  Then we got our appetizer, shrimp cocktail. Only.. it wasn't a shrimp cocktail, it was more of a shrimp ceviche without any acidity and barely a watery taste of cocktail sauce. We kept trying to doctor it with stuff on hand, limes and salt/pepper.. best we could get was \"meh, it's edible\". This was the #1 reason for the lack of points. If they would increase the cocktail sauce, then perhaps we could forgive the chopped up shrimp.. but, as it is, waste of money and calories.  Then the entrees...  Hubby got the Guinness Pork Carnitas.. amazingly juicy, tender pork served in mass quantities but with only 3 small tortillas.. ratios were way off. I tasted it, it was good.  I got the shrimp tacos.. it came with two of those small tortillas covered with a monster amount of the same chopped up shrimp from the appetizer, only with different seasonings (small amount of spiciness, which I thought was just right), and one small wedge of avocado on each. After removing about half the shrimp, I could almost fit it in my hand. It was good, but needed something.  Oh, I know.. perhaps the mango salsa that was listed on the menu but was never served? Who knows, might have made the difference.  Overall, it was okay. We'd be willing to eat there again, but we won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Amazing sangria!! Homemade tortillas which remind me of my grandma from Mexico. The shrimp tacos were fresh and spicy!"}
{"text":"Ohhh K yes I am a little loose on throwing up a 5 Star rating but when I like something and have a good experience they are going to get everything they deserve!!! Fast Friendly service with equally as amazing food taste and presentation! Keep up the GOOD Work!!!! The Bambi burger was fantastic who would have thought Bambi and Arnold(from Green Acres) could be such a great combo!"}
{"text":"This was a cool joint that has been around for a year and a half that I would not have know about had it not been for........yelp.    Located in a complex in a cool part of town that I thought I was familiar with, given the name..I thought I was going into a lodge style feel sort of establishment.  Not the case!  There is almost a lucha meets Alaska sort of vibe...again...I was confused.  WTF is PW talking about?!  Hell, I don't even know...but when you see a moose head and glance a menu, and it says burrito and taco, but the place says \"Hunt & Gather,\" a thing that I have only in the past four years come to really know the meaning of....just come and check it out.  Came during a weekday when the GF and I came to check it, I found there to be a mellow vibe.  I was torn between a \"Mammoth Burger\" but asked about the Cuban sandwich.  I asked for a recommendation...and was told to get the \"Libre Cuban.\"  In retrospect, I should have got  the burger.  The Libre was a tad dry.  BUT!  The GF's turkey tacos.....This brought about the \"Great White\" effect.  GW effect is your eyes roll back in your head and mine did.  The tastiness still haunts me.  Pizza or elk meat, squid or edamame, burritos or quinoa......massively confused but equally excited....I am coming back!!"}
{"text":"This place is small but cute. The spinach dip is amazing (because they put cream cheese in it) and the fresh garlic pita chips that go with! My friend had the ribeye which was a very good portion of food and delicious. I do recommend trying the sangria while there."}
{"text":"Writing a bad review is never a priority, but after salivating over the other reviews posted and the concept of the restaurant, I thought we'd give it a go. While it was very quiet and we had great service, the food was just very disappointing. I was so excited to try the garlic sweet potato fries, thinking there would be fresh chunks of minced garlic. Nope, garlic salt. I played it safe with the turkey croissant sandwich over the tacos, and blah. Deli turkey meat, gross. I would have never ordered if I knew I would be getting super sodium flavored deli turkey meat. My husband went for the special of the night which tasted straight from the Indian restaurant. Not at all the flavors he was expect or wanted. His chicken looks so clearly machine cut, straight from a frozen bag. Disappoint. The spinach dip which was raved about was absolutely delightful. However you couldn't eat too much because the pits it was served with had so much...yup garlic salt all over it. I had to wipe some off just to stomach it. Id say we'd love to come back and try something else, but we probably won't."}
{"text":"Not that good. Very awkward. No temp taken on weird tasting burger, so it came out well done. Music kept cutting out and changing from Mexican to 1950's jams. No dessert or coffee offer. Order-taker service. That's pretty much it. Weirdest dining experience I've had in years."}
{"text":"Ok, I am in my third trimester of pregnancy and I am ADDICTED to their arroz con pollo and plantains. Like, I just paid $30 to have that and a salad delivered from GrubHub and it was worth every penny!  We've dined in once too (I had the same thing) and enjoyed the food and customer service. One of the best restaurants on this side of town for sure!"}
{"text":"My family and I came here for the first time and must say it was much better than expected. Ordered the turkey burger, Guinness carnitas, Libre Cubano sandwich, and a salad. I am cuban and was skeptical about the cuban sandwich..it was DELICIOUS. My husband loved his carnitas and the food was just really good. We came around 8 and it was not busy which we like..love that it's around the corner from the house..will def come back..oh and most important..the Sangria was yummy."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  Awesome place to eat and hang out!! My wife and I really enjoy the elk sausage and yucca fries but my wife's favorite is the Cuban sandwich which is the best I have ever tasted!!  Mayra and Ignacia are so much fun and make the place even better.  My wife's cousin and boyfriend came to visit us and we brought them here and they enjoyed it so much that they stayed an extra day just to hang out here.  : )  Hunt and Gather has become our local place to hang out now!!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed in the over all experience. We were searching for a place to grab lunch with our son and had noticed this place a couple of times when we picked up Capriotti's. We checked it out on Yelp and the reviews were mostly positive. I ordered the wings extra crispy and they were cooked perfectly but lacked a lot of flavor. One thing that always strikes me as odd (and a lot of places do the same) is that I do not like the drum stick style wings and only like the flats but they would not let me get all flats because they were pre packaged per order? Like I said other places do the same but still doesn't seem like it would be a huge deal to offer the customer what they wanted (even with an up charge). I also ordered the cucumber salad and it was decent. The one thing that really bothered us and kind of ruined my appetite is when they brought out my sons cheese pizza. Initially we thought it was a frozen pizza. It was soggy and had Mexican style cheese melted on top. When we scraped the melted cheese off we noticed that the pizza had been previously cooked and just had new cheese (on top of the old cheese from the first time it was cooked) thrown on top. Something else strange is that if your credit card has a chip in it, which most do now a days, you have to tell them what you want to tip before they run your card. The waitress did say \"if you would like to tip\" so she handled it the correct way but still the system should allow a tip to be added on the check like every other restaurant. The service was good and that's why I'm giving 2 stars instead of only one.   I really hate to write a review like this because I love to see small businesses succeed but I do not think we will be going back."}
{"text":"Every time we have eaten here it's been wonderful. Everything I have tried has been delicious & different than any other restaurant. Service is also fabulous."}
{"text":"I had the Dominicano sandwich. Delicious, it comes with sweet potatoes fries or plantains. Being the island boy I am I chosen plantains. The plantains were not as ripe as I personally like them but that is very subjective. Having grown up in Puerto Rico I can tell you that plantains are served in many ways and all levels of ripeness. That said I think the food was very good. The staff was extremely friendly and as for the 'Decor' as someone else complained about, I thought it is fine. Then again I go to a restaurant for their food first and foremost, and service. If those two are good then it doesn't matter where it is or how it looks, you will enjoy your visit."}
{"text":"Great small local restaurant. Great little place to go and have dinner with the family, or watch football. Food was excellent, we had the burger and philly and really enjoyed them. Service was impeccable, Mya was efficient and courteous. We plan on this being one of our new regular spots."}
{"text":"My friends have been telling me I needed to try this place and tonight I went and it didn't disappoint! Had the spinach dip for an appetizer. It came out bubbly hot in a little cast iron skillet. The cheese was creamy. Topped with fresh green onion and served with very fresh pita bread. I would highly recommend this dish.   Had the Cuban sandwich for my meal and it was loaded with meat. Great flavor and taste. The garlic fries it was served with were fresh and crispy. Amazing! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome new restaurant! As soon as I walked in the aroma from the kitchen heightened my expectations. I was not disappointed. Had the Dominicano sandwich; the serving of meat was so generous I had trouble finishing. Luckily I had their Sangria to help wash it down. The sangria, like the food, tasted delicious! Warm and welcoming atmosphere with a very friendly staff. Also their kitchen only uses olive oil, no cheap canola oil here. Great food, great drinks, great portions and a friendly, low key atmosphere. Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Best food in North Las Vegas!   Friendly atmosphere, with a great wine / beer selection and excellent wine cocktails! We tried the morejito that is a spin on a traditional mojito, and the sake to me! Both were made with fresh fruit and hand mixed!   Food was excellent as well. We shared the spinach dip that was to die for! Fresh spinach with creamy cheese served with warm pita bread! It's a must try!   We also tried the mammoth burger, that was made on a fresh bun, with fresh veggies, and a killer sauce! The combo of sauce and burger melted in my mouth!   Honestly the best tasting food I have ever had in Las Vegas!  This little place is a gem! If we didn't live in CA we would be here all the time!   Thanks for the great hospitality! We will be back on our next trip out!"}
{"text":"Great food, I mean really good! Chill vibe, family owned and they have large beers. Can't really ask for much more! Such a wide assortment of food. I have had the dominicano and burrito both excellent."}
{"text":"I had the Huntsman pizza.  Loaded with meat including steak, best pizza I've ever had!!!  And it was huge.  2 slices filled me up and I can eat!! Wife had gluten free and loved it.  Kids also had a pizza and also loved it.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Look a great new joint with amazing fresh food and great service! I watched a couple go ballistic on the owner because their food wasn't ready? She said are you ready and they said after we chill a bit with this beer! Anyways they where rude and owner was awesome! Try the spinach dip! Pizza! Cuban sandwich and try the salads!"}
{"text":"I'm a tad late in writing this review.    I am all about supporting small businesses and really wanted to love this place abs add it to a favorite in the far northwest.   However, the food was pretty lacking. My husband ordered the Jonny cakes and we had to send them back.  I've never had them  super sweet and as gluteny gobby as they were.  The rest of our party ordered the breakfast burritos and they ended up in the garbage once we got home.   They were kind enough to make my hubby something different but overall the meal was just meh.   I had high hopes as another friend came here before we did and was okay with the meal and then after we came another friend had a pretty awful experience with being ignored by the staff.   There are so few places in the far northwest to eat that are independently owned and you guys really need to step up your game if you plan on staying open for any length of time.   We came in on a weekend morning and were one of two tops in the place.  The service was okay but not top notch considering how few patrons were in the place.   Our favorite place LuLus is packed at the same time as well as some of the other small mom and pop places.    This may tell you that you need to reimagine your menu, change your customer service or something because if you have a good place in this neck of the woods you should have a lot more customers 24/7, and with the amount of off reviews ( I know you can't satisfy everyone) you should really work on the issues before the reviews and not after.  Because once one person tells someone to avoid you then everyone hears it and all of the follow up responses on Yelp won't make the difference.   The key is to get them in the door with good food and service and don't let them leave with a bad taste in their mouth.   Looks like I'll still be going to LuLus for my Cubano sandwiches !"}
{"text":"First visit. We ordered the dominicana (mostly because the cubano has mustard). Great decision to come here. The perfectly juicy sandwich was paired well with the sweet potato fries (the fries were a little overlooked). If you order the sweet potato fries, definitely get the house sauce and ranch to dip (the house sauce is like Arby's horsey sauce).   We'll be back"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here looking for something different. We found this on yelp. I got the el Dominican and my husband got the burger. We also shared the chicken tortilla soup. Every thing was amazing! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The waitress was friendly and helped us with the menu. We got the Spinach Salad and the Guinness Carnitas.  The beer was ice cold, and the food was great.  The homemade tortillas were wonderful. They had other interesting items on the menu we can't wait to try."}
{"text":"Place: just ok, too dark for my taste, lack of personality. Staff: absent & overwhelmed. Food: ?  30 minutes of my life wasted:  I went there on Friday at 7:30pm, the place wasn't crowded at all, it took the waitress 15 minutes to bring the food menu and another 15 minutes to bring the drinks menu.  The menus were incomplete, lacking,  no sides,  some drinks  ( seen on yelp ) were not on the menu. After 30 minutes wait, no one took our order, basically we were just ignored.  We decided to leave and go somewhere else. They are obviously understaffed.  Unfortunately we didn't get to try their food or drinks."}
{"text":"Great service in the restaurant and to go. The food is amazing, and so very fresh. This is our new favorite local spot!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly people that are warm and inviting.  The food is delicious with a Cuban influence.  The sangria is very refreshing at the end of a hot summer day."}
{"text":"Service was good and that's about it. The burrito tasted like it came from a can. Salsa had a weird vinegar taste and was the smallest serving ever. My mom got a beet salad, there were literally 3 tiny slivers of golden beets In there. The salad was nothing but a spring mix and cabbage, a whole load of cabbage. Pretty much nothing else. Disappointing cause I really had higher expectations for this place. Will say that the chicken was really good and better meat quality."}
{"text":"It is a very different type of restaurant. They don't have normal everyday food. If you want something different and unusual then it is a pretty okay place to try."}
{"text":"Service said draft beer was HH, whan Bill came charged 10 per beer.  Server lied and said that she never said draft beer was HH, only bottle.  Good is ok, but nothing great"}
{"text":"Found this place tucked in a strip mall where I get my pedicures and the name hunt and gather caught my eye so I decided to give it a try. I was hoping that the menu would have more veggie options because of the gather part of the name but sadly there are only a few options though I am sure i could ask for a modification to an item if I so desired. The place is like part bar, part booths and tables. Decor is a bit confusing and the big old moose head is a bit scary.  Both times I have eaten there it has been pretty slow, only a few other customers. The big screen TVs and loud music is a bit off putting to a quiet conversation you may want to have with your table but hey, its not a library. :) The menu is very diverse with appetizers, entrees of tacos, pizza, sandwiches, salads, pasta, seafood, etc. The servings are nice and big so you will leave full. Last time I went it was 2 meals and one drink for 28$. Service is quick and to the point."}
{"text":"We ate there several times, food was always good and service was excellent! It's a great neighborhood restaurant and will continue to visit!"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly. When we walked in the door it took a few minutes for the staff to realize that we were there.  Conversation at first was awkward but once the flow started we chatted for a minute.   The food was very tasty. I ordered the chicken fajitas And my husband ordered the guiness carnitas. We both really enjoyed our meals. They let us sample beer before committing to one specific. I would recommend trying this restaurant."}
{"text":"Good...kids liked their pizzas and my pita was good. Service was good, portions were good and not overwhelming. They have a great selection of craft beer for a small place!"}
{"text":"Wow Wow Wow. What a treat we found this afternoon. While waiting for tires on our car, we walked across Azure to the little shopping center to kill time. It was late in the afternoon & we were a little hungry. We stopped in Hunt and Gather for some lite fare. While pursuing the menu the Libre Cubano sandwich caught my attention. Our waitress assured us it was good so we ordered one to share. We ordered a small cheese pizza for our granddaughter. We moved to Vegas three years ago and had all but given up trying to find a good Cuban sandwich. Let me tell you, Hunt & Gather makes the best Cuban I have ever had! Incredibly flavorful and the bread was crispy and delicious. You could taste all the individual flavors of pork, ham, pickle and a light mustard. Most places cannot get the balance of flavors right. This place nails it! Home run! Touchdown! Slam dunk!  BTW the cheese pizza was quite tasty, too!!!!  We will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Food was very tasty. Still working out new restaurant kinks, but overall a good experience, we'll definitely be back. I had the grilled steak tacos, very tasty but a little spicier than I like (I'm 0-2 heat at Thai food kind of gal). Husband got the Chicken Alfredo and loved it. I tried some and the sauce was very good. He says the sauce was amazing and the chicken was tender and well seasoned. We also got salted caramel cheesecake and salted caramel gelato. Both were great.   The ambience still needs some work, but that's to be expected in a brand new place like this, I'm curious to see how they grow! The service was great, very friendly. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Just found this spot on Yelp.  We recognized the owner as soon as we walked in.  She used to work at Leticia's.  Way to go opening up your own business.  Great good, very nice and simple beer selection.  Your twist on the cuban sandwich was fantastic.  May try a happy hour stop for beer and a snack soon.  Great food and fairly priced."}
{"text":"The food was really bad, service was on par with the quality of the food.   We had the El Burrito and everything was overlooked and falling apart and tasted microwaved everything was burning hot and there were no temperature differences between the ingredients.  We then thought we would try the Lava Cake. The lava cake was on our table less than a minute after we ordered it and it was so painfully obvious that all they did was microwave the crap out of it.   The two girls that were there were either texting the entire one or on their personal laptop. It was such an awkward and unwelcoming environment we will never go back."}
{"text":"If a restaurant was judged on the food and drink menu alone, this place would get a 5.  Unfortunately, the decor, service, and ambiance pull the score slightly down. I've only ever seen one woman working, and even though you can tell she's doing her absolute best to ensure her guests are provided for, there needs to be a larger, more supportive staff.  Sparse decor makes for a difficult-to-describe atmosphere, wth neon signage and a large moose head, a handful of TVs tuned to sports or sports programs, and aside from the above-mentioned mount, no real reference to the cafe's title. (Park in downtown has a much more playful take on taxidermy you may want to check out, and while the food is not as good, is a more entertaining overall experience.) It has never appeared busy when I've been there, which is surprising, because the food is +A. I highly recommend this place to anyone! Just please exercise patience and courtesy."}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent.... The cubana sandwich was best in Vegas .... Only open three months, ..... This is a place to watch.... I for one am coming back!!!!!'"}
{"text":"Had the Cuban sandwich, wife had the chicken skewer on quinoa.  Food was delicious!  Took 2 turkey legs to go too!  Friendly service.  A variety of menu selections  (in a good way though).  Hope they succeed.  Yelpers please check them out!!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing place!! The new spot in Vegas that makes you feel comfortable and relaxed. The decor is amazing, never seen a moose head before!! And the food? By far some of the BEST I've ever eaten. Got to try the Artichoke dip and a glass of sangria! You will not be disappointed when you leave! Such a great place to chill!"}
{"text":"I don't think I will return, we came here based on the reviews on yelp.   Warning sign number one, there was a closed sign on the door.   Warning sign number two no one was in the restaurant at lunch.   The biggest problem was that after we ordered and got drinks we found out that the only things that we wanted from their great looking menu were not available. The waitress was jus ho hum about when we said we were leaving."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now and the food is great! You have a variety of foods to choose from of different ethnicities. They don't skimp on portions and it taste good. It's more like home cooking rather than restaurant food. The sangria is very good and you only need 1 ;) . This time around I had the carnita sandwich (I don't remember the name) and it had really good flavors. My son is 3 and they made him a smaller plate of food at our request. I ended up eating some of my son's rice on his plate and it was no ordinary rice. It had veggies and a small kick of spice.The employees even held/entertained my 4 month old while I ate my food, which helped a lot! We also ordered the cheesecake which was devoured within a few minutes!"}
{"text":"Well, we went because we like to support our local businesses and it had a 4star rating. Our first clue should have been that there were only 3 customers at 6:30 on a Saturday. The first strike was when the silverware came... after the salad.... It was so disgusting I'm sure the last person's DNA was still on my knife, then I had to poke thru the lettuce because it was old and wilted so a good portion was picked out. Then the entree'... Cuban and fries. The fries tasted and looked like they were cooked in warm oil, the Cuban was actually good, but rather greasy. The blackened chicken Alfredo... Huuummm..... Well the pasta was cooked in \"warm\" water. Almost every strand was stuck, more liked they were glued, to another piece. The chicken wasn't cooked fresh, rather rubbery in fact. The staff was fine, but the lack of cleanliness and the the fact that something as easy as pasta or French fries are cooked so horribly, especially on a Saturday night, we won't come back. We ran next door to cappriotti's and brought it home! Yummy!"}
{"text":"2nd time here. We NEED to come more often. We had the beef tacos this time. They are hands down the best we've ever had. Nice folks too!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Great fusion options - we started with the best shrimp cocktail we have ever had and some great hummus. The Cuban sandwich is unbelievable and the carnitas are fantastic. This place has a great vibe and the people are very friendly. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to find a place that had turkey legs. The online menu said they were $8, when we got there they were $10. Not a big deal if they're good, right. I was going to have one there & take one home.  It came with a little barbecue sauce & that was it! They're weren't even sides on the menu. It was cooked fine but was drenched with salt. Nobody bothered to ask how things were either, that's a real negative. Needless to say, I didn't get a second one to go. They did have Moose Drool Beer on tap, $7 for a pint though...Updated to 2. The owner responded in 3min, that shows they're trying."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and prices are very reasonable. Staff was attentive. My husband had the half rack of ribs and thoroughly enjoyed it. I had the grilled cheese. That's basically what it was. Cheeses on very thinly sliced potato bread and fried. They were slices of heaven. Very delish. Many other dishes we will be coming back to try. Recommend this little place to all those Centennial Hills Folks!"}
{"text":"My wife and I just had the Libre Cubano (Cuban Sandwich) and the Pollo Bowl... with PBR on tap.  All was awesome!  The Cubano is huge, pollo bowl is great flavor and comes with fried plantains.  The PBR is big and cold.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time at this neighborhood restaurant and I fell in love! Amazing healthy menu choices with large portions. They also serve beer and wine which is always a plus! Great atmosphere and the service was superb. I will definitely be coming back frequently.  We tried the turkey burger and the quinoa salad with blackened chicken and both were delicious! They're coffee was great as well. I will be recommending this place to EVERYONE!"}
{"text":"I love Cuban sandwiches, and they're impossible to find.  If you're like me, look no further. Hunt and Gather's Cuban sandwich is awesome. I used to have my girlfriend grab me one whenever she could, usually once a month or so. Now I've discovered that Hunt and Gather is on Grubhub and I'm ordering the Cuban sandwich embarrassingly frequently. It's really awesome, though.  The pork is well seasoned, well cooked, and they put plenty on there, the toasted bread is perfect, and if you're lucky you'll get a little pork crusted to the outside of the bun and get to enjoy that. It's one of my favorite things.  Awesome place for a Cuban. I haven't tried much else because once I find something I love I usually stick with it.  The girlfriend has really enjoyed everything she got while she was working as my delivery driver in the past."}
{"text":"We tried the Cuban and Dominican sandwiches and both were Amazing!!! A definite to visit again.  The service was friendly and hard working.  Not overly busy and the right amount of steady..."}
{"text":"I give them 5 stars for the frog legs! They are hard to find anywhere and this place is   right around the corner from my house. I have had them 3-4 times (the only item I have ordered from there) and they are yummy!!! Today I noticed they had tamales on the menu. I may try those next time."}
{"text":"They served me a  1/2 pound hamburger(so the menu said) that was as big as one from McDonalds!!  It really didn't matter I couldn't eat it as it was burnt and as dry as saw dust!!!  I sent it back and declined any thing else. Excuse was it was her first night in the kitchen!!!  No return visit. Also the music was so loud you couldn't hear the person next to you"}
{"text":"Hunt and gather is a hole in the wall everyone should check out. The food and the service is amazing. Come as you are very fun and relaxed atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I Got the blackened chicken Alfredo and it was revelatory. I recommend this spot 100% to anyone that's on the fence coming here."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! So sad its gone! I think it was just not the right location, because ALL the food was AMAZING!!!  Please find a new location in the Centennial Hills area... SOON!  Missing the Cuban sandwich, BEST in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed we really wanted to like this place and sad cuz it is close to home  extremely UNFRIENDLY  & poor quality food  I can buy a bag salad at the store The owner showed zero concern when she saw that our food was not being touched oh well it is what it is"}
{"text":"We went today to eat the cuban sandwich and ohhhhhh it was incredible!!!! We love it!!! Sangria and beer was delish too!!! We post it in facebook and every body start asking about it :)"}
{"text":"I had the best Cuban sandwich with nicely seasoned plantains I have ever had.  It was complemented with the homemade Sangria wine.  Several TV's to view your show of choice."}
{"text":"I order the Cuban sandwich with the fried plantains.  The sandwhich was  a very nice size and delicious. The roll had a nice hard crust with a soft inside. The fried plantains were delicious and sliced thick. Reminds me of my childhood. Very nice portions and a very decent price. I shall be returning to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"The best little hidden gem!!! We had the el Domenico Libre Cubano and the steak tacos they were all fresh ingredients and huge portions. So happy we gave this place a try we will be back regularly and tell all our friends and family to make sure they have business cuz they seem slow but they should be packed!!!! Oh did I mention the buns and tortillas had to have been made in house."}
{"text":"First try in this new spot.  Love the simple menu with the culinary flair and experience in the culinary background.  Happy hour specials off appetizers.  Will be back to try more items on the menu and re-review.  Nice bar set up with high end craft beers.  Homemade sangria in he mason jars a nice touch.  Had the calamari to start and it was perfect.  Awesome flavor and vegetables perfect for a light appetizer.  Next time I'll have more time to explore menu and favors.  Glad there is a new independent restaurant in our neighborhood.... Coming back soon for Cuban sandwiches"}
{"text":"Nice place with excellent food and fresh ingredients.  The shrimp cocktail was quite good, as was the hummus.  My wife enjoyed the carnitas, while I had an outstanding Cuban sandwich, and a huge Caesar salad.  The only issue I saw was that there appeared to only be one server, fortunately they only had us three and one more at the bar, any busier and it might have been a problem.  I hope they stick around, this location does not seem to produce many customers.  I believe it used to be an Italian restaurant named Verdi, which is no more."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!!!! found plastic in my turkey sandwich! I was chewing and felt something hard and pulled a piece of plastic out of my mouth.  They took it off my bill and the cook came out and apologized and offered to remake me something but no thank you! I will never eat here ever again.  Also they only accept cash and they don't tell you that until your bill comes."}
{"text":"I ate here with my family last night and was beyond impressed with everything!! We ordered a cheese pizza and kid burger for the little ones and they loved it. The burger was gourmet enough that any adult would love yet \"kid friendly\" enough for my picky 6 year old to eat. We ordered the spinach dip for an app and were literally scraping the sides at the end to get the last little bit. My wife ordered the Carnitas which were to die for, complete with homemade tortillas. My sister ordered the Pita Vita with bacon and avocado and it was probably the table favorite. I ordered the carne asada burrito and it was outstanding and was plenty to have the second half for lunch the next day. We ordered sangria and siracha beer and both were excellent. For dessert we had the cookie with ice cream, tres leches and regular cheesecake and all 3 were winners!!   We will be going here at least 2 or 3 times a month as it quickly became one of our favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Amazing food , I had a skinny chicken bowl, it was so tasty that I thought I was cheating on my diet lol , so glad that they have healthy options and it is sooooo good. The service is great! Lovely family owned business. A must try for sure"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from Grubhub for lunch. I got the Cuban sandwich. It was delicious! I had been craving a Cuban since the last time I went to Florida and I finally found a good one. Large portions I ate half for lunch and the other half the next day. It was even good left over! I'll definitely want to go in and eat I bet it's even better!"}
{"text":"Changing my review last night because we never had an issue previously. Also the owner got back to me and corrected the issue. I will try to order from here again.  Just ordered from here again and it was awful. They gave me virtually no sauce for the vegan bowl and it really needed sauce because otherwise it had no flavor."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in the north! My fiancé and I were happy to find such a great café near home. We came here last Saturday night and the place was pretty empty. It was nice and quiet for our date night. I ordered the sangria based on other reviews and I was very pleased. The sangria had a delicious flavor, slightly thicker than others I have had. I think it may have had some fruit puree in it.   My fiancé ordered the sake Bloody Mary and was a huge fan. He said it was pretty spicy, but he enjoyed it because it forced him to slow down and really savor it.  We also ordered the spinach dip, Cuban sandwich, and the burger. WOW! The dip was gooey like mozzarella was used in it. The gooeyness made it hard to dip the pita in, so I just spooned it onto my pita and I really enjoyed it like that. The pita bread was slightly crispy and flavorful.  The burger patty was HUGE and the so was the Cuban. We had to take most of it home because we were so full from the drinks and appetizer and the garlic fries it came with. We couldn't wait to eat the rest the next day!"}
{"text":"Quaint little place located in a strip mall. First thoughts sitting down and looking at the menu, combined with the decor, is that this place seemed confused. Weren't many people in when we were there but we waited an hour for our pizza to come out. Burnt, unfortunately. The staff was pleasant and the spinach dip was yummy but the burnt pizza (that lacked good flavor and had barely any sauce), really sealed the deal on us never coming back. We had two slices of our 18 inch pizza and took the rest home (to be polite). It went in the trash. See photo of burnt pizza before it met its trash can fate."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and fabulous food. It was our first time in and it just felt like home. The burritos were delicious. Perfect amount of heat without being overpoweringly spicy. Will definitely be back. The waitress was kind and checked in often. I was impressed by the way she juggled 4 tables including serving, clearing, wiping, etc without seeming frazzled or frustrated. I enjoy when people do not seem annoyed to be working!"}
{"text":"Low key and not too pricey, food is fresh and yummy. Nice meat selection and I like the neighborhood joint atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love that this restaurant is so close to home. The food is healthy, delicious and very reasonably priced. I ordered the steak skewer with quinoa and vegetables. The portion size was plentiful. I ate half and had the rest for lunch the next day.  My husband got a salad that he thoroughly enjoyed and ate every bite.  We went back again and he ordered the same salad and I tried the smoked salmon and crab salad. Mine was good but I prefer the steak skewer.  This is definitely our new favorite neighborhood restaurant. Give it a try for the food.  The decor can use an update. It has potential to be a very cute little bistro. Perhaps some beautiful drapes for the front windows and additional wall art. There is an interesting wooden structure hanging over the bar that could be improved upon; perhaps with different color wood stains or paint."}
{"text":"We love this place. Great service, super creative menu, good ambience! Tonight we had yummy ceviche and an entree from the specials menu - a pork verde dish that was outstanding! Love that there is a regular menu and then different specials each week, great variety. Try it, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I ordered the Cuban sandwich and the spinach dip. My girlfriend ordered the rock shrimp on special. All three dishes were very tasty! The meat in the Cuban had such great flavor. I would definitely order it again but, wanna try some of the other stuff they offer."}
{"text":"Very good. Nice selection off the menu. Lots of options from pizza, sandwiches, to salads. Good drink selection and nice staff. I would recommend giving this place a shot and try some different things off the menu. The smoked turkey leg and spinach dip are out of this world. Also if your down for a pizza that is filled with meat toppings try the huntsman."}
{"text":"By far our favorite restaurant in this corner of the valley! I just wish we didn't live so far away...  Always a pleasant time, always great service with good recommendations, a great beer and wine list plus innovative wine cocktails. The menu fits any mood we go in with: sometimes hearty but healthy salads, or superb sandwiches, or mouth watering pasta. Still looking forward to trying the pizza. We always start with the best calamari anywhere - and we've tried a lot! This calamari is perfectly cooked with a crunchy flakey breading, and as a bonus there are veggies too, kind of an American tempura! Or maybe it's Cuban or Dominican, there are lots of great influences in the diverse menu. And we have yet to find one we wouldn't order again!"}
{"text":"After weeks of wondering what this place was, I finally dined here today for an early dinner around 4 pm. We were greeted warmly by the hostess/waitress and seated immediately. There was one other table of customers, 4 young guys drinking beer. The waitress then took our drink order and even was nice enough to give me coupons to order online from grub hub. I ordered the Cuban sandwich everyone has raved about and it didn't disappoint. My daughters ordered a smoked turkey leg, chef salad, and the tomato bisque. We also ordered the spinach dip and that was the star of the meal. The freshly cooked pita bea is delicious alone even! Our drinks were refilled and once we were done eating the check never came. We sat for roughly 20 minutes as our waitress flirted with the group of young men there. My 15 year old commented that they were obviously drunk. (Kids can tell!) I turned completely around and faced her back as she kept talking with them. The conversation we overheard was plans for future parties together, and a message to be delivered to the bar tender Rachel. Oh then Rachel comes out from the back to tend to the bar and join in the conversation, all the while also ignoring my table. They didn't even glance in our direction for 20+ minutes. I finally had enough and stood up, walked over with my debit card and asked if I could pay. The waitress asked us if we wanted takeout boxes for our leftovers. I replied no thanks, we did but now we just want to leave. She says oh sorry and laughs it off, all the while maintaining her conversation with the drunkerds. She hands my card off to Rachel, who comes back to my table with the receipt to sign. She asked if we needed takeout boxes, again I explained we did but just want to pay and leave at this point. She said oh sorry about the wait. The bill I was given didn't even have a breakdown of the items ordered. It was a credit card receipt with just an amount. There was no place for a tip, and honestly she didn't deserve one so for the first time ever, I did not leave a tip for my meal. The only reason this isn't a one star review is because the food was actually fantastic, but so not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"PLEASE SUPPORT OUR LOCAL RESTAURANTS!!! This place is great. I had the Dominica sandwich, and it was so good, and so juicy, and the sweet potato fries were great. Don't let little gems like this disappear. Myra is one of the owners, and she is super friendly.  Stop in, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Their sweet potato fries are the bomb!  Everything here is very paleo based, so really fresh and not processed. The salads are huge, and everything can be altered. I have had their pizza's turned vegan just by not adding cheese, and subbing a bunch of veggies.   The space is a little small, but it is never super packed.  The staff is always really kind, and they take orders for pick up/"}
{"text":"This place is a true find in Las Vegas and specifically NW/Centennial Hills (Azure & N. Tenaya). Great food in casual atmosphere. Everything is super fresh and beer is always cold. Family friendly place, where everyone is always treated special.  The Mammoth burger is always juicy and fresh. Try the homemade humus in addition to other starters. There are many other items on the menu - all made to order - including daily specials that will fill you up and bring you back for more."}
{"text":"This place was awesome, they put some real love into the food and you can taste it! I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"First time here and we all loved it! My hubby and I split a chef salad (nothing spectacular, but love having a healthy option)!  We balanced the healthy out with a Cuban sandwich. So good! My son raved about the burger. The fries were yummy! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food... Pizza is phenomenal! The prices are more than reasonable and we've been coming here every weekend due to the other great food they serve."}
{"text":"This place had so much potential. Unfortunately they lacked follow through. Disappointed.   Everything was extremely salty. Sweet potato fries looked like they were dipped in salt.  The spinach dip was the best thing even though it was more a cheese dip than spinach dip. And the chips that came with it were stale.  The Thai salad tastes off. Wasn't anything special and had too much coriander. It over powered all other flavors. Seemed like a bowl of shredded cabbage with some wontons. Couldn't taste the ginger,  cilantro or any other Thai flavors.   The Cuban was so greasy and salty, I couldn't finish it. Plus no sign of mustard. And garlic fries it came with were just plain fries. They were crispy and cooked right but again, over salted.   The fish tacos were good. Tortilla looked fresh made, thick but fell apart trying to eat it.   Gave them two starts cause service was really good. Very nice servers."}
{"text":"$15 pitcher of sangria I dont think can be beat. Fried tomatoes weren't bad- tasted like fried zucchini. The hubs liked them after he got ranch. Spinach dip was good. Hubs liked his Cuban sandwich, mammoth burger was alright. We wouldn't come back for either of those however the spinach dip and sangria will bring us back to try other menu items  Cute little place. Bathrooms by only smell good but they look nice and have good tp!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple more times since my initial review. Service and quality of food have been excellent each time."}
