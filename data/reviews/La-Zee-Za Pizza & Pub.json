{"text":"Ordered a ham, pineapple, and mushroom for take out and when I got home, there was no pineapple. Called them and they said that they would make me a new pizza, but I really didn't feel like going out and driving down there again, so I just said forget about it. Other than that, the pizza had very little sauce and was so soggy that you couldn't even grab a slice without it falling apart."}
{"text":"Lets be honest you couldn't pay me to eat at the restaurant. It's not dirty or anything just not my scene. The pizza is stupid good. Like sensational. When you order shrimp you get lots, that's rare. Ask another shrimp lover. I drive way out of my way just to pick up from this place. Ham pineapple and shrimp. No need for extra cheese. PERFECT. Not a five star cause there are way to many numbskulls smoking outside the doors."}
{"text":"Damn! That pizza is hella good. It's pricey; About $30 for a 14\" pizza but it is a quality, quality pie. No shortage of cheese and toppings abound, it will feed 4 easily and you will love it.  Order take-out though, It's not classiest joint. But the food is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Food wasn't great, beer selection wasn't great either. I will honestly never eat here again, it smelt of old cigarettes and it was just all around a dive bar."}
{"text":"Pretty good neighborhood pub with great food!  Recommended!   They've got karaoke Saturday nights as well."}
{"text":"We go frequently on Sunday's for the music.  Great jam.  However today was the worst food I have ever experienced.  Ordered 2 beer plus a glass. Ten minutes later had to go to bar for glass.  Ordered beef dip sandwich 20 min later it came meat was dry, chips and gravy were cold. If the place was busy I could understand but at that point it wasn't.  Worst waitress ever"}
{"text":"Not the fanciest place.  Local watering hole with really bad 70's and 80's pop music.  Accommodated our request to turn on the hockey game volume saving us from the music.  The redeeming factor was the pizza.   Had a chef's mistake and a Greek pizza.  Both were excellent."}
