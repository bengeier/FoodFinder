{"text":"Needed a quick, local place to pick up a sandwich.  Clearly this is where the locals go. Large menu of sandwiches and salads from light to heavyweight. This is middle America and middle American food. Right on the money."}
{"text":"Best omelets around with large portion of tasty shredded hash browns. Friendly fast service and comfortable seating. Lenny's is our go to for Sunday breakfast. Looking forward to trying the corned beef sandwich as I've heard it's awesome. Joey is super nice and a great cook. If you enjoy good food served fast in a neat and clean local deli, go to Lenny's Deli."}
{"text":"I LOVE LENNY'S DELI.  First time back since the remodel. The inside is so nice now.  I love Joe's soups. Really homemade.   Great place to visit!รท"}
{"text":"We WANT to love Lenny's so bad but it's just not living up to it's potential. We've been there a few times for breakfast and lunch and it's been \"ok\"...if there are more then a few tables seated it takes a long time to get your food since it seems like there is only one cook in the kitchen. I love the Greek flare they put on everything and wish they'd do more of that...the hummus plate special they had once was awesome but I haven't seen it again. The restaurant itself is small and it's an eyesore to stare at the coolers and stations. It has a lot of potential and could have great food with a couple of tweaks...but with kids the long wait for food is what has kept us away."}
{"text":"Best corn beef ruben on the west side. Wether youre walking in with the family or grabbing something on the go, this is the place to go if youre in the area.   Local favorite, very friendly owners. Good prices for the size of your food. Right off 480, on the way to/from the mall, Walmart, target, etc... Shekit it out y'all."}
{"text":"Lucky me that this place is just a mile from my house.  Great, small local restaurant serving up hot good old fashioned American food!  They have great sammiches like their famous corned beef, reuben, club, gyro, chicken, and more! I love their fresh cut corned beef...so flavorful and tender, with generous portions of meat. (nothing crazy like Slyman's or Joe's, but just right!)   They have a good variety of burgers, wraps, and salads too. They have great breakfast options like the usual pancakes and assorted omelets. They're open all day on St. Patrick's day, serving up hot corned beef and cabbage specials and the usual sammiches.  They also offer beer battered fish fry specials during Lent. Check their Facebook page for specials!  The family that runs the restaurant is very friendly and the a few times I've been there for takeout, the chef (maybe the owner) personally hands me my order and thanks me for stopping in. He seems like a really cool guy.  They have a fairly small, but cozy dining room with one TV and the parking lot isn't huge, but they make do with the space that they have.  Stop on in for some great breakfast, a sammich, or some fried fish and support a great local restaurant!"}
{"text":"The owner treated me horribly!  He will not honor gift certificates that people paid for!!!  Last I knew it was illegal to not honor gift certificates that were paid for!!!  There was no expiration date and was purchased on Dec 2013.  Just over a year old and they were closed for months which took up some of that time!!!!!  I even called and asked first to be sure and they lady said yes I can use the gift certificate!!  Then upon arrival the owner came out and gave me a hard time about it so, I said he can keep it!!  I will never go back!  This was just downright rude and if they don't want to live by the law, they should at least put an expiration date on them!!!!"}
