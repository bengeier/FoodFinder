{"text":"Random street food right in front of shoppers drug mart! 

They have the popular red bean fish desserts and many other small eats that are decently priced, and great to top off the night, if you have just had another meal down the street. 

Most of their items are around $5 and is reheated or made to order. A few things to be aware of is that they are cash only, sometimes run out of the items that you want but stay open to sell other products, and sometimes they are just closed without notice. I've been there about two times when the cart was closed up."}
{"text":"Wish there were more stands like this in Toronto! The spicy rice cakes and the pork belly are divine. The red bean dessert I got was just okay, but a friend mentioned that it may be because it's usually the son who makes it and he wasn't there that night. Super cheap and close to Finch TTC station."}
{"text":"I spend 3 super cold nights a week every Winter shivering infront of this place waiting to sink my teeth into the cheapest food in North York.

Love it! It's pretty much a meal under $3.

Note- Cash only. You can get cash back at the Shoppers Drug Mart infront of the Food Cart - I bet that's what all the Koreans in the Shoppers line up are doing."}
{"text":"If they don't mess up your order they will accidentally overcharge you or you'll chip a tooth on a rice cake after 7pm. Not impressed with this place at all"}
{"text":"Oh man! I love Toronto a la Cart! Miss this shiet. Their spicy rice cake skewers & fish tempura balls. Mmmm... I need to try everything here. Seriously. I never knew spending only a buck or two on something could make me this happy."}
{"text":"I like to stop by whenever i'm in the yonge/finch area. 

My favourite items :

-pork belly
-rice cakes in spicy sauce
-red bean cakes :these are very crispy"}
{"text":"Love their red bean fish waffles! 
Cheap & yummy. 
Spicy rice cake & Fish cake are just OK. 
Very convenient location."}
{"text":"Had positive experiences both times ive been here.The servers have been nice and very efficient both times(were busy).

First time i went to pojangmacha i ordered their rice cake and 2 beef dumplings.Dumplings were alright,the filling was good but the tops were very hard and crunchy.Personally i would skip them next time i go.I got spicy sauce on my rice cake which was great the cake was chewy and the sauce had a nice kick.But i made the mistake of not eating it right away.So by the time i had walked to finch station and was eating it while waiting for the bus it was cold and didnt taste as good.

Went back a few weeks later and got the red bean waffles which were awesome.And you get 3 of them for $2.50 so you cant go wrong."}
{"text":"Awesome Korean street food. Everything there is delicious and you can't go wrong no matter what you order. The spicy sauce is pretty spicy, so be careful if you're not into spicy things that much. Always fast to get your order out and it's always fresh. The red bean waffles are amazing and are always hot when you get them, they're not just sitting out forever."}
{"text":"This my favourite Korean snack cart! It is soooo good. My to-go snacks are spicy rice cake and the squid balls. If you can't handle spicy, you can also get a teriyaki sauce to go with it. Honestly though, everything from here is so good. Go get some!"}
{"text":"I LOVEEE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVEEEEE POJANGMACHA!!

red bean waffle is a #1 MUST TRY 

their SPICY RICE CAKE is awesome!!! a bit crispy on the outside and the spicy sauce tastes wonderful.

pork belly is awesome tooooooo!!! 

not a fan of their korean pancake though..."}
{"text":"This place just make me double pay for my order. I ordered 6 orders, they missed one and i went back not even 3 mins waited in line again. They ask for money again. It not expensive but the point of them charging for something they missed just pissed me off."}
{"text":"Yummmmm. The fish shaped red bean cakes () and the deep fried noodles wrapped in seaweed () was so satisfying on a chilly evening. Wish the portion size was bigger, but for the price, you can't really complain!"}
{"text":"Nice red bean waffle, not too sweet, perfect balance of crispy and chewy.
The material of the rice cake skewer and beef dumpling is okay, but the combination of sauses makes them tasty.
Fish cake soup is decent.
Rice cake&sausage has much better marshmallow-like rice cake, and you pay more as well.
I have tried all the others except pork belly, they are just okay.
Overall, great cheap bites for treat time."}
{"text":"I ordered red bean fish cake, odeng,kimali and fried rice cake ($6.50 total cost). I recommend the red bean fish cake, it was crispy outside and lot of red beans inside! Spicy rice cake was a must try for only $1! 
Odeng was one of the worst odeng street food i've tried, nothing comparable to Korea. kimali was just ok! I'll get more red bean fish cake next time im in the area. Good price and decent quality street food for what you pay!"}
{"text":"I never buy taiyaki from those overpriced crowded nightmarkets. The taiyaki here  taste way better and are cheaper. This food cart offers varieties of small snacks like rice cake, squid balls, fish cakes ,etc. the prices are all around 2-3 bucks. The portions are small since they are snack and which is fair for the price. Love to come here in winter, it is so cozy(minus the walking/ waiting in the cold part).
Would be amazing if they have soju and beer with  a few set of chairs and tables like the night markets in Asia(take my money(yo we need dai pai dong here in t.dot)

4/5! Perfect for people who can't eat much and want to snack on a bit of everything."}
{"text":"I come here just for the fishies. Which is the taiyaki red bean filling fish shaped waffle baked goods. $1.25 for 1, 3 for $3. Just get 3+, don't even hesitate for a dollar each.

They are usually made on the spot, you can see them filling each mold to be made fresh. 

The Hmart by Churchill also have the taiyaki. I found this stall usually makes it crispier, and thinner batter.

The street stall is right in front of Shoppers. This is one of the few stalls left from the old Toronto initiative to have more variety then just hot dog for street foods. While most stalls closed down - this one remains successful. I've been going to this for over 10 years now!!!!!

Cash only"}
{"text":"This place is great. I tried the beef and kimchi dumplings, rice cakes and the fish red bean dessert. The dumplings had a great flavor to them. The rice cakes are just absolutely perfectly cooked, and the spicy sauce on it was amazing. The red bean dessert was delicious and a real bargain."}
{"text":"The service is very rude and the food is just ok. The staff don't speak English very well. When i asked for a bag for the chicken breast to go, they reply \"no bag\" in a very rude attitude. The skewer is very salty, the red bean fish has too little stuffing, the fish cake is ok."}
{"text":"Always a great place to fill the void of Seoul street food! Affordable and yums.. definitely try their fish cake in broth to warm up"}
{"text":"Korean street food. Theres that guy that reviewed \"Cheap. Quick. Delicious.\" and he's not wrong. 

Always go for their rice and fish cake. The taiyaki is fresh. Perfect Yonge and Finch chill food."}
{"text":"Gotta get the taiyaki (~$5 for 3) and the spicy rice cakes (~$1)!

Edit: they raised the prices by 25%"}
{"text":"I was excited to come here

But the Red Bean Fish cakes were not what i expected
They were more crunchy, not much taste and pancake tasting whereas i was looking for the cake textured and soft  steamy sweeter red bean cake. 
Also ordered dumplings they were too hard though.. Not that good. 

But I will maybe come back to try the other food on the menu since the 2 workers there were very polite and nice.  Also they have a lot of variety , SO I am looking forward to try other things IF I DO HAPPEN TO DRIVE BY :)!!"}
{"text":"Il probably come here often because It's so cheap and convenient (right across the road from the subway). The foods decent... Definitely worth the price 

Cash only"}
{"text":"Toronto lacks good street food (unless you love hot dogs). This is street food done properly. Quick, cheap, tasty, fresh!"}
{"text":"I can't imagine how they could improve their hot, delicious, freshly-made waffles, baked in a vintage cast iron mold over real flames and stuffed full of a sweetened red bean paste that is perfection, and even the price is great!
Other items on the all-snack menu are rather pedestrian and range from \"not very good\" to \"just ok\", but the waffles are the best I've found.
They're open all kinds of crazy hours, on Yonge St. Just below Finch, in front of Shopper's Drug Mart, and are perfect for a late-night treat, and at just $3 for 3 crispy packed full red bean fish waffles, you really can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see a street food cart (hut?) set up in North York while driving past a month ago. While the street food scene primarily been hot dogs around here, this cart has upped the game by offering some of Asia's best snack food options. 

A permanent box set up at the corner of Yonge & Finch (just outside the Shoppers), Kim's A La Cart serves cheapie eats made perfect for the stumbling soju drinker. I was impressed with the selection of food, but I came for the fish cakes. Cute little waffles in the shape of fishies and stuffed with red bean paste, these are the perfect late night snack. They're about 6\" long, and you can order them three in a bag. If you're craving salty or savoury, there are other options as well, including pork belly, kimchi pickles, dumplings, and more. 

Here's to hoping more street food options pop up in the city!

Cash Only, obvs."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the area I've got to grab some red bean fish from here. So crisp and tender. As authentic as night markets back in Asia! The shop owner and her family is so warm and friendly. Would highly recommend trying."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's great when you're in the go and you want a small filler or a whole meal! It's really cheap and tastes great! the people inside are very friendly and very close to the finch subway station! Love their spicy rice cake on the skewer with their fish cake soup! Most items are a dollar :)"}
{"text":"Cute little cart to grab some snacks. First time trying the Fish Waffles and I love them! Cute bite size desserts. Very delicious when they are fresh and crispy! They are now $2.50 for 3, and if you are watching what you eat, can get one for $1. 

I've had other snacks here before, but I thought they were pretty average. It is pretty brutal to have to line up in the cold. But when it's warm it's alright. Will come back to try more varieties!"}
{"text":"This place is right up the street from my childhood home and it has been a longstanding favourite of mine for a tasty, hot, and quick bite to eat. My favourites are definitely the red bean fish and the spicy rice cakes! The pork belly is also delicious, and the broth with fishcake is wonderful as well. It is always one of the first places I bring people who haven't ever had Korean food or aren't from the area."}
{"text":"Love this place, they have the BEST RICE CAKE!!! Cuz it's crispy on the outside. ; )"}
{"text":"Food is really inexpensive and tasty. It obviously doesn't taste as good as the street foods in Korea but it is close. It reminds me of Korea so I love that. Only downside was that the worker was in a bad mood when I got there and it definitely showed. This place is convenient, cheap, and good so I recommend others to try it!"}
{"text":"Cute food truck located near Finch Station. I got 3 taiyaki (3 for $3 and 1 for $1.25) and they were still hot when I ate them. The edges of the taiyaki are and taste a little burnt though. However, compared to other taiyaki stores, this taiyaki is not filled with batter and more with the red bean filling."}
{"text":"A must try! It's a very cute Korean cart located in front of Shoppers Drug Mart that serves various 'sample-size' dishes. Everything is pretty cheap and tastes amazing. I'm obsessed with the red bean fish. It's 3 for $2.50! I'm pretty sure it's their most popular item too."}
{"text":"One of the fave street food for people in North York. Especially those live just upstairs.. like me.

Fish shaped red been waffle is my fave. $2 for 3 fresh made crispy waffle is such a steal. Pan fried dumplings look good. Tried the fish cake once too, not a big fan.
Pork belly Skewer is another famous product and OF COURSE, they have spicy rice cake.  
Just love street food more than anything. Want a simply tea time, grab a red bean waffle and get a green tea latter from Starbucks steps away, then your afternoon will be perfect. 

Welcome to North York again :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love their fish cake. Recommend the rice cake.. Teriyaki if you don't like spicy"}
{"text":"Oh my god their taiyaki is just amazing. I can't go to yonge and finch without getting it. Its honestly the best I've ever had and I wish they had more locations!!"}
{"text":"This food truck is right outside of shoppers drug mart and this is my go to place for Seafood Ball $2.25 for 4 pieces and fish cake with soup $1.25, one skewer. I love their seafood ball, as the inside has some chewiness  to it and the exterior is dry but inside when you bite into it, it's tasty. I can sometimes each 8 pieces by myself. They will ask you if you want spicy, I enjoy the spicy sauce, and it is not too spicy.

The fish cake with soup comes in a skewer, it's perfect for winter. Sometimes I come here before dinner or if after dinner I am not full, I will also come here for snacks. The flavour is always consistent for my two go to items."}
{"text":"Right in front of Shoppers but now closed due to winter. The red bean fish waffle is made fresh and perfect when you crave something warm and sweet."}
{"text":"Wonderful street food! Been coming back here for 3 years now.  love how simple the choices are too. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The food items are pre-made(maybe they make a huge batch during the busy hours) so the wait for food is not long.

For what you get and the price I think it's a bit overpriced, especially since it's from a kart, very small portions for the price.

The red bean fish dessert is delicious! 

If you need a quick snack, this is a great option."}

Pojangmacha Food Cart @Finch/Yonge.
Something about it reminds me of my past.

I do miss ASIAN street food culture.  : (
I do miss the lights, sounds, snacks."}
{"text":"I happened to be in the yonge and finch area and found this really cute cart. got the red bean waffle (3 for $2.50) and it's soo delicious; cute fish design that is crispy all over. Dough is not tough and chewy because they used rice flour to fry. Inside, the red beans are not too sweet, which i'm happy about. Seriously recommend.

Too bad i came here after dinner, or else i would've tried a lot more! Definitely coming back one day!"}
{"text":"I crave the crispy red bean waffle. Spicy rice cake & kimchi dumplings are rly good. I will definitely try their other stuff soon."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for this place. Each time I go past, it's hard not to grab a snack, especially as they're ridiculously affordable. 

$1.25 gets me a stick of odeng (fish cake) with a cup of steaming hot fish broth. That'd be amazing for winter. Also summer. I had this when it was like 25 degrees Celcius outside. Still good.

$2.25 gets me 3 pieces of gimmari (sweet potato noodles wrapped in seaweed, battered, and deep fried) with either sweet hot sauce or teriyaki. I got hot sauce this time. They were fairly generous with the hot sauce. The extra sauce went into my odeng broth. Extra yums right there.

My snack cost me $3.50. Not bad, given that this actually has nutrition in it.

Their red bean fish waffles are fresh, more often than not, given how many people buy them. 

I've also been to Red Bean Waffle House, which is also owned by them, but the atmosphere here is so much nicer because it's actually on the street."}
{"text":"I've passed by this cart over the last 2 years since I moved into the area. I really wanted to try it every time I passed by it but never had the chance.

Well last week before a Yelp Event, I decided to grab a few things to try as I was advised the Yelp Event food will be limited (it was not). 

Grabbed pork belly, beef dumplings, chicken skewer and veggie pancake.

I reallllly wanted to like this place but unfortunately did not. 

There was a guy making those fish shaped pastry things and obviously was busy but asked me for my order, I had a feeling he'd not remember since he was busy with the pastries but I told him it anyway. That led to a short pause as he kept doing his pastry thing, then he asked me again for the order cause he forgot (duh, stop multitasking), and he asked 1 last time, for a total of 3 times. Ok whatever, it's a cart I'm not expecting Scaramouche service.

How can I describe all the items? Luke-warm mehness. Pork belly tasted and felt like beef jerky, beef dumplings was ok?, chicken skewer was nothing special and veggie pancake was no crispy but flourey like not fully cooked.

Disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"This place is the bee's knees, the bomb diggity, the everything good wrapped into a little stand!

Sure the food is sometimes a tad bit cold, but whatever, It's delicious!

Everything here is so cheap! 

My favourites here are:

1. The Dumplings : Currently, they have 3 kinds, beef, kimchi and curry chicken. I can't decide between them, so I usually get all three. 

2. The Squid Balls - My friend is addicted to them!! They're so yummy is ridiculous!

3. The Red Waffle Fish - Definitely the highlight. Three well stuff fishies for 2.50. They're such a great snack!

I love this place. I will keep coming back over and over and over again."}
{"text":"Mr Kim is the last man standing with Toronto's failed La Cart program

He offers Korean street food at its best and located in front of Shoppers Drug Mart at Yonge and Finch and that means he is a popular attraction in little koreatown

I love his red bean paste filled waffles shaped like fish. Kim makes these fresh while you wait

He also offers 

Rice cakes
Tempura Fish Balls
Several styles of dumplings
Pork belly
Chicken on stick

Every selection is a few bucks and with a tenner you can enjoy a nice selection of Korean lunch items

There are a couple of parks nearby to enjoy your meal if your doing a foodie drive by

I have been here many times and have always had a great meal"}
{"text":"Everything here is worth trying. Good prices, great food and always made fast. Always consistent, friendly service, seems to always be open."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????hold??????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Little food cart just south of the SW corner of Yonge and Finch, located right in front of the Shoppers Drug Mart.

They have an assortment of small portioned foods on sale for cheap prices, such as a rice cake for $1, squid skewer for $2, small portion of noodles, etc. 

The item I believe they are most known for is their red bean-filled waffles, which come in the shape of a fish. They sell 3 of these for $2.50, or you can purchase a single waffle for a dollar. These waffles are made fresh when you order, and they are so popular that you will always see the staff making a fresh batch (they have a waffle maker that can make about a dozen of these fish shaped waffles at a time).

If you're looking for a quick, cheap snack and are on the go, Kim's is a great place to make a pit stop."}
{"text":"Good place: Yonge finch
Good price, so cheap
Good taste and clean

Would recommend to any one"}
{"text":"Love this place as this has good Korean night snacks that are super cheap and great to have with friends when hanging out"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for: cheap Korean street food that's premade from frozen (except the taiyaki that's made on the spot). The soups tastes like miso soup that you would buy from the store, very salty. All the seafood are very fishy tasting. Everything is drenched in either a spicy sauce or teriyaki sauce. The taiyaki was crispy on the outside and filled with red bean paste which would taste better if it were a tad bit sweeter. I did enjoy the Bulgogi, Kim-Mari and the spicy ketchup based sauce. 

There was no line up when we went, staff is friendly but there is a definite language barrier; I had to repeat my orders a number of times. My food was barely warm, maybe it's better during the rush hours. The soups, however, were piping hot!

I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. If I was in the area, had only a few coins in my pocket (items range from $1.25-$5), and was hangry, I would stop by again."}
{"text":"My favourite taiyaki place! Cheap. Quick. Delicious. What more do you need?

Whenever you pass by, do yourself a favor and order 3 taiyaki for $3. Thank me later."}
{"text":"To hell with the current food truck craze. I'm surprised to learn Yelp has an entry for this food CART, because it is friggin awesome and flippin cheap!

This is probably the only cart left from the miserably failed \"Toronto a la Carte\" food cart program the City ran a few years ago that is still in operation. It is usually set up in front of the Shoppers Drug Mart at Yonge/Finch. And it will blow you away with awesome Korean street foods for the streets.

All you need is a handful of change to try it all. Teriyaki rice cakes? Yummy! Squid balls? Omnomnomnom! The sauces they use pack a punch of flavours and/or spiciness. The old aunties serving the freshly cooked to order stuff to you are cute in the grandmotherly way.

The cart is convenient for transit commuters and office workers in the area. But not for lazy downtowners and hipster-foodies who rarely trek anywhere north of Eglinton. Of course they should, but I feel compelled to disclose they also have another location in one of the shipping container booths at Market 707 (Scadding Court CC, Dundas/Bathurst)."}
{"text":"The rice cakes were crispy and oh so good with the spicy sweet sauce, I regret not buying more. The squid balls were not very memorable but the pork was great. The fish cake soup was tasty too(esp in the winter haha), although I really wish there was more soup. The waffles were tasty but I think I prefer the ones at ktown closer to the city."}
{"text":"This little food truck has the best red bean waffle thingies (taiyaki) ever. If you are ever at the Yonge and Finch area, you NEED to try this. Sometimes however, the wait could go up to 20 minutes and that's why there's a Shoppers there to walk around in. 

Their other foods are great too but their signature taiyaki is just amazing. Value-wise, I don't think there's anything you can get that's as good as this for $2.50. Everything is super cheap and good.

Verdict: If you're at Yonge and Finch, go get some red bean fish waffle things. You won't regret it and if you need to wait, then just go to Shoppers ok.

That's all."}
{"text":"I think it's decent for street food but just okay. Quality-wise, the fish cakes taste like side dishes from Korean restaurants.

I always get the red bean cakes and they're fresh, softer and smaller than the usual ones you can get from a Korean supermarket. Pretty good price and easy to grab for on the go.

Bring cash and don't expect a receipt."}
{"text":"The hits keep coming. The pojangmacha food cart has added a couple more Korean street food staples. 

They've added one of my favorite Korean foods of all time \"wang mandu\". Wang means \"king\" and \"mandoo\" is dumpling. So. King dumpling. The food cart people have translated it to steamed dumpling. I've seen wang mandu translated by a very upscale Korean department store into English as \"big dumps\" so I'll take the generic translation vs a rather scatological scattered attempt at conveying the idea these are the \"kings\" of dumplings. You could get about six of these puppies for $3 in Seoul. Here they're $1 per. They contain, roughly, some kind of meat, veggies, and noodles. You really don't want to inquire too closely regarding the contents, considering these things were a way for Korean food companies to package up garbage and sell it in the frozen food section (http://yasuzaki.zero-yen.com/chaotzu/html/skorea_health_dumpling_040610120023.html).

The menu also indicates they've added samgyupsal to the menu but they were out when I was there this Devil's Night eve. Samgyupsal (\"three stripe meat\") is a kind of uncured bacon. I've personally never been a fan. It's the grease of bacon without the maple seasoned goodness. It's just a strip of hot texture in your mouth. It is, however, the ultimate Korean male bonding food. Where as Canadian males might bond over a pitcher of Export Ale and basket of wings, Korean males will bond over a table cooker full of samgyupsal and soju."}
{"text":"This little food stall has a nice collection of Korean snack foods that will fill you up for a cheap price.

With these stalls you expect fast quick and piping hot food. The food was definitely quick. Sadly my pork belly skewers and and fried rice cake looked like a pile of turd and some hot gun glue sticks. It wasn't even a hot pile of turd.  You would expect for a food stall that they would make your food to order...guess not 

However food is cheap and palatable. If it was hot I would even say it tastes good. For 5 bucks you can satisfy those hunger pains. Cheap enough to warrant another try."}
{"text":"The \"spicy sauce\" is delicious here. Although they seem to use it on every item on the menu. Rice cakes, dumplings, and soup noodles are my personal favourites."}
{"text":"I loved the red bean fish cakes, a great dessert to cap off the night after eating nearby. Freshly made, crispy outer layer with a fluffy red bean and dough middle. And so cheap also!  Bought 6 for only $5 - a great deal. Had a skewer of rice cake which had great texture and taste. Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Street food?! Food on a stick?!  Yes please!  I've been here SO many times now.  It's one of my favourite places to go for cheap food.

KIMCHI RICE POCKETS: Kimchi fried rice in pita bread with some green onions.  I asked for it without sour cream because I'm not a big fan.  It was a little bit hard to eat, and it was quite different.  Worth the $2.50?  Maybe not.
RICE CAKES (Dduk-kochi): Absolutely delicious.  They cook it just right that it's a tad crispy on the outside.  Spicy sauce is the best.  You can't go wrong with this for $1.
SQUID (Ojing-kochi): This is sooo good and definitely hits the spot.  However, I believe they just raised the price.
PORK BELLY (SamGyupSal-Kochi): BACON!?  You can't go wrong. So good.
My favourite... RED BEAN FISH WAFFLE DESSERT (Bunggeoppang): I love love love love love this.  It's sooo good.  Especially when made fresh.  

If you're craving for a snack at Yonge-Finch, THIS is the place to go."}
{"text":"This Korean food cart is located just right in front of Shoppers.  People queue here for the fish-shaped waffle. The red bean waffle is slightly crispy on the outside and spongy inside with the piping hot red bean paste. They have 10ish Korean street food in their menu. It's hard to conquer all their snacks at one time, but Kim-mari is a must try!!  The Kim-mari is so yum! Deep fried seaweed roll filled with glass noodles and with spicy sauce; superb! $2 for 3!"}
{"text":"Located directly in front of shoppers drugmart at Yonge and Finch, I frequent this food cart regularly, sometimes even driving 10 minutes just to get to it. The spicy rice cakes are a definite must try, as are the red bean waffle (taiyaki)! I honestly think the red bean waffle dessert is the best I've had in Toronto.  It is definitely worth the wait (as it often happens since some people order two or the orders at once! )"}
{"text":"One of Toronto's hidden gems I swear!!! I always have to make a stop here whenever I'm in the area. Korean street food -- noodle dishes, fish balls (spicy or teriyaki flavour) & more. Fast service and the people who work the cart are always so nice. 

I HAVE to get the red beans waffles every time I go. (Always freshly made)


(I am aware these photos aren't the best but since I found the business on yelp I will be posting another set when I visit again ^.^)"}
{"text":"Everything here is cheap cheap cheap. $1 for a lot of the things on the menu. For a quick snack I got the $1 fish paste on a stick dipped in soup. No idea what its actually called. Also got the $1 rice cake with some pepper paste sauce and the fried fish cakes with red bean paste - $2 for 3 fishies. After trying all these items I think the only thing I would come back for is the fried fish cakes. They are nice and crispy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside. And $2 for 3 fishes is a steal because I have seen these sell in Korean grocery stores for way more."}
{"text":"Stopped here to meet the BF for lunch, but the neat thing is that nothing is over $5.

 The best thing are their red bean fishies[taiyaki] ( 3/$2) hot and fresh and not stuffed with a terribly sweet red bean paste; perfectly balanced and a great sweet ending to lunch and for sharing."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this stand because of the reviews but I was let down. Yes, the price is good but the quality isn't really there. I don't even remember the protein I got, all I remember was that it was salty and lukewarm. I'm a fan of giving places a second chance so I would probably try this place one more time and I'll decide from there."}
{"text":"Been here so many times and they never disappoint. I wish there were more food carts. These make for great snacks to pick up on your way home once getting out of the subway. I love the taiyaki as well as the SPICY sauce in their rice cakes! I have no idea what there hours are like. I think they close during certain times of the year (winter?)"}
{"text":"Right on: Best fished shaped red bean waffles in TO.  Get a couple orders as I keeps well and make sure it is extra crispy. The rest of the snacks are nothing special."}
{"text":"Went with a friend as i had loved this place for many years. Told her how lovely this joint was and how great the food tasted (cheap and yummy!) 

Not so much for this time. 

Food was great but service was poor (lady who was preparing the food on the side was a complete b*tch even though i did NOTHING to offend her). First of all, the stall had one customer before me and no one else so it was not buzzing like usual, so there was no need for the guy preparing the taiyaki and the lady to completely ignore my existance for 5 min. Finally acknowledging me, the taiyaki guy is friendly and asks what i would like to which i tell him a chicken skewer, with spicy sauce. He asks me to repeat it a few times which is fine, then he repeats it to the woman who is supposed to make the food. She asks him \"skewer?\" and he says \"skewer\".  Then she asks \"spicy?\" and he says yes. Then she turns to me and says \"skewer? Skewer?\"  so i reply \"yes? 1 chicken skewer\". 
\"$2\"
So i give her the money.
She starts making the skewer and both staff members ignore my friend who also wants to order.
Then she gives me the weird looking skewer thing and i think \"maybe they changed things up... This looks nothing like what i normally have here\" 
I take a bite and its a squid. So i immediately tell her, and this lady SNAPPED and started barking at me. 
\"YOU SAID SQUID! I ASKED SQUID AND YOU SAY YES\" and completely making a scene. 
So i calmly tell her \"no,  i said chicken skewer.  Skew-er.\" mind you she has an accent so i understand if i misheard her squid for skewer but i specified CHICKEN  skewer? So how could i have messed things up? I speak perfect English so i do not have an accent on my part. 

\"well it'll be $4 then \"she says
I tell her no, its $2 which i PAID. I did not ask for the squid. So why am i paying for it just because she messed up? I offer her the skewer back for my order. 
\" I DIDN'T MESS UP, YOU DID!! YOU TOLD ME THE WRONG THING!!! \"she berates. 
Wtf?? The taiyaki guy talks to her to calm her down and tells her to just make the chicken for me. 
She takes a lukewarm skewer, dips it in the spicy sauce and just tosses it on the counter (no napkins or anything) and DEMANDS i give back the squid skewer which i was more than willing to do. 
Then she starts ranting to the guy in Korean saying how the hell i could hear squid for skewer and it's all my mistake blah blah blah. 

Because my friend was here and i had gotten what i ordered, i chose not to start anything and left. 

This was a complete embarrassment for people of both sides and frankly speaking i did not deserve to be treated that way. I was completely civil and polite with her, and it was unfair to be treated like a liar and an idiot in return. I would have recorded the full thing on video to post but as i have enjoyed from this cart before and did not want to blow this out of proportion, i chose not to. But if i see that woman going off on a customer again the next time i pass by I'll be sure to record it and post it online for the world to see."}
{"text":"The best waffle fish with red bean filling outside of Korea!  VERY mashisayo.  Popular place - and for good reason.  Very reasonably priced and good pojangmacha-style umshik.  Bungeoppang -- mmmm ... mmmmm ..."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 items, 2 of them were not fully cooked (centre still frozen)..yikes!!! not returning for sure"}
{"text":"I love buying the fish waffles here. Since I cannot eat 3 waffles in one sitting (no discipline & will try), I usually purchase 1 for $1. It is always so fresh and delicious. Even in the winter (-30 temps) the lines are long at this place and most are waiting for these yummy waffles. 

I have tried the udon/noodles here before but it was not cooked long enough and did not bother trying it again. Not a fan of the rice cakes either. Too carby (is that a word?). The pork belly is amazing and I love all the dumplings especially with the spicy sauce. 

Closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Food was good, very convenient location near Finch TTC southwest exit. I'm glad that Toronto has this permanent street food cart, like, really glad, I love everything street food. 

This review mainly for their service. Being a timid person that I am, I stood there for a few minutes to wait them to finish what they're doing so they will acknowledge me and give me a cue to take my order - that never happened. They saw me but they were just chatting with other staff. So I decided to just order ahead- again, no response, no indication that they had heard me so I didn't know what to do and just stood there awkwardly while they talk to each other. 

Meanwhile, another guy came to order and again, doing what I was doing before- waiting for them to acknowledge him. That never happened either and being braver than I am, ordered loudly for a few times until those staff finally responded \"OK\". The only time I was spoken to was when they tell me the price. I'm not saying good customer service is required, but at least don't make the customers stand there like an idiot wondering if they have ordered."}
{"text":"Good prices, good food but just a little chilly sometimes in winter standing in the cold :)
Builds the atmosphere I guess.

The red bean waffle fish is pretty packed with red bean and tastes great. Even one of those is pretty filling and can't beat being cooked fresh most of the time.

Also had the skewer of the rice cake in the red spicy sauce. Never had better rice cake skewers. Grilled to be a little cripsy on the outside and the sauce went well with it. 

Will try the other things on the menu next time. Cash only remember!. Usually can find a quick street parking spot but watch out there are a lot of parking cops, at least they appear whenever i plan to stop by."}
{"text":"Ultimate street food destination on Yonge and Finch. Get their Kimari - deep fried seaweed rice rolls and their noodle soup, which comes in a cup. They're open till pretty late too!"}
{"text":"F*CK yeah, this place has fish-shaped waffles stuffed with red bean paste! 3 for $2. 

The waffles are cooked in a fish-shaped waffle iron, very similar to the walnut irons at Hodo Kwaja.

4 stars just for the novelty value. But they were pretty tasty and served piping hot!"}
{"text":"The best and most fresh red bean fish cakes dessert ever! A little pricey. There is always a line up. They are starting to have more dishes to offer which is great. Hope they will add more desserts!"}
{"text":"Mm so nom nom good -stuffs mouth with fish shaped red bean waffles- Mmmmmm.. Delicious hot red bean waffles, pork belly skewers, and squid balls!

Came here on a freezing Saturday night with no lineup and no wait time. They had a special for $2.50 - 2pcs pork belly & 2pcs squid ball. It was amazingly flavourful!! Looove the red bean waffles. Crunchy on the outside and full of sweetness inside. 

Portions were small but it's about the right size for the right price. I don't think it can get any cheaper. 

Hooray for street food/street cart/street snacks etcetc!"}
{"text":"This food truck is conveniently located close to where I live and I go there way too often to purchase their red bean waffles. 3 for 2.50!!!!! Who can resist? Everything is super affordable and tastes pretty good too! Probably my go to place in the Yonge/Finch area."}
{"text":"I always wondered how they can operate in such a tiny space! The food they make are hot and ready when ordered. I got the odeng (fish cake) and it was really good, first time trying it street food style, especially the soup that came with it. The pan fried rice cakes were chewy but delicious. I will for sure try their other menu items!!"}
{"text":"This little cart serves a list of korean staple snacks. Very affordable and convenient for on-the-go or just to satisifes those tastebuds.

I absolutely love their Red Bean Waffles as many yelpers have expressed their contentment. Crispy on the outside and sweet on the inside; filled with a read bean paste. It is also in the shape of a fish, how cute! 

Their rice cakes with teriyaki sauce and the spicy sauce was mediocre. But I mean, it is grab&go food and you do pay for what you get. I found it to be a bit on the tougher side rather the tender side however, it was acceptable with the sauces. 

The Rice Cake & Sausage skewer pretty much taste like how it's advertised. Again, rice cakes were on the tougher side and as for the sausage, it was made well. Sausage had flavour, similar to a pack of sausages that you'd get from the grocer. Like the rice cakes, you get to choose to have it with a teriyaki sauce or the spicy one. 

Haven't tried all the items yet however, winter is approaching and I will be back for their soups and dumplings!"}
{"text":"The red bean fish waffles are the best! I
Best served fresh and warm. Everything on the menu is affordable. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I would rate this place a 4 star if I were to rate just the food since they serve decent food for cheap.

However on my last visit (a couple months ago), I got ripped off.
I order 3 fish cakes, and their squid balls.
They told me that their squid balls were going to take a while, so I asked if I can get the fish cake when they're done making the squid balls.
They agreed, and they told me to wait for 5 minutes.
After 5 minutes, they gave me the squid balls and not the fish cake. I told the lady that I also got the fish cake but she disagreed. After a few back and forths, she finally gave me one fish cake and told me that I may have ordered 1 but not 3. And since they don't keep a record, there was no way for me to prove it.
I liked the place but I was disappointed by their service."}
{"text":"This is SO SO SO Neat!! A food cart in the middle of the street in North York selling Korean snack food!! 

I don't believe my eyes when I saw the food cart on the sidewalk and I scream with delight \"Karl!! This must be the Korean thing you yelp about!!!!\"

So cute with the little gold fish cake maker and they are light and crisp and warm for $2/3! Thanks for Lauren M for sharing! I think they are better than the one at Green Mart!

There are also other Korean snack food that all reasonably priced. I for sure will going to back to try them all!

I wish one the day there will be one for Thai, Chinese and other Ethnic food cart appearing in the Toronto area instead of just boring HOT DOG stand!"}
{"text":"Really cheap and delicious snacks! I've been coming here for almost 8 years now every time I pass by the area and it's never to disappoint (except when it's closed). I usually get the spicy fried rice cakes!"}
{"text":"Amazing prices for amazing Korean snacks! Will always stop by when visiting In the area! Love the pork belly / red bean waffles / and Kim mari. Good stuff 

It's $3 for 3 waffles and $1.25 each 
$2.25 for the pork belly"}
{"text":"I felt being discriminated after the experience tonight. I was buying 12 red bean waffles and the selling guy said they only have 4 and that was it, so I bought 4. After that ,I heard the person behind me was requesting for red bean waffle and selling guy sold him couples of red bean Waffles. I am still wondering what is going on and what was the problem to sell me more than 4 red bean waffled???"}
{"text":"My go to place for Korean snacks. Very good, affordable, and very tasty. Wish there was one closest to downtown."}
