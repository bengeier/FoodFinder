{"text":"Wow !!! Pleasant friendly English speaking waitress at a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown,. Amazing! The best in my experience. Always ask about daily special dishes first."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since I was on a student budget. Above average food, good value, kitchen slow at times. Waitresses are always friendly and efficient. will continue to come back with my family and friends. Pls, Love the fresh live seasonal seafood!"}
{"text":"The food here is good and I've ordered from here a few times, but I won't be ordering from here again. I found a strand of black hair and a dead cockroach in my fried rice. Disgusting! Had to throw out$50 worth of food. I looked them up on DineSafe and it looks like they have a history of infractions, including inadequate pest control!"}
{"text":"My daughter has grown up loving to eat here. The waitresses know her and her love wonton soup.  Very Tasty food, Great take-out. Reasonable price."}
{"text":"Nice servants and tasty dishes. Loved their ginger onion stir fried lobster, marinated steamed free run chicken, steamed fish, bbq pork(char siu), ong-choy in bean curd sauce and green bean with meat stir fry. The crab steamed seafood rice in lotus leaf wrap was just ok. Bbq duck was average. Other veggies and appetizers we've ordered was fine but none of them was much impressive. The in house dessert of the day was mung Bean sweet soup, it was good. Overall the restaurant is worth trying. Recommend their green run chicken and lobster!"}
{"text":"I never understand why my mom love their lobsters so much, this is her go to place for lobster. Their lobsters are really just mediocre-average. Everything else tasted decent, quite greasy, nothing stands out. I have to admit I really enjoy the taro tapioca dessert at the end of the meal.  Great service, decent food, price is fair. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"I was looking for an affordable and calm place for lunch. I stepped into this restaurant and greeted very gently. The Chicken fried noodles with vegetables was delicious. Will visit there again. Highly recommend for students and families who are looking for a calm environment.  P.S: Cash Only :)"}
{"text":"Food was delish!  Very inexpensive for the portion sizes as well.  Went during non rush hour (linner) and the owner/waitress was very nice and friendly, had a nice conversation with her.  Located right in the heart of Chinatown."}
{"text":"Took awhile for me to get around to this review as my experience of this restaurant was on a Friday night on the Canada day long weekend.  Was in the area again on the weekend and before I gave this place one star I wanted to make sure it was the right place.  So like most the joints on this section there is absolutely nothing fancy about the interior or anything amazing about the ambience, it is all about the food and I give this one star based on the one bite I took out of a beef curry before I got up and left.  Arriving early morning around 2am we randomly chose this place as it was not busy apart from one group of 6 already there.  We sat down, ordered our dishes quick and myself opting for a simple beef curry.  Mine was the first dish to come out and to be fair it was a very large portion so I offered it to two others to help themselves but after taking my first bite I had to spit it out into a napkin.  The beef was rotten and the rice was completely off, after advising my friends to stop eating there share I decided I was not going to return the dish and ask for anything else so I quietly told the waitress lady the problem and politely told her we are going somewhere else.   I will not be going here ever again"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery tonight. The delivery took 70 mins to arrive and when I got that plastic bag, the driver just left immediately. I was confused until I find out that everything in the bag--including 2 congee and 1 beef dish--are all messed up. Its like I'm not holding my dinner but a garbage bag with disgusting liquid inside. Then I called them ask them to redeliver or just give my money back. THEY REFUSED!!!!! and told its ALL THEIR DRIVER'S FAULT, it has NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM. SERIOUSLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WORST RESTAURANT EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"That Umbrella Guy @ Rol Jui.  Came for lunch. It was pretty empty, which probably isn't a good sign compared to other chinese restaurants downtown at lunch time. Could be the weather, but today is pretty nice.  Service is alright. Lighting is a bit dim to me but that's because I would like all the lighting I can get for pictures since my phone isn't good in low-light.  They advertise $5.99 cash-only lunch specials which comes with a free soup.  Ordered the chicken fried noodles (with vegetables ?????), cause I like the crispy egg noodles that cantonese restaurants make.  Chicken was really salty, and the vegetables were really greasy but still had no real flavour. Noodles were nice and crispy, but that's about the only thing I enjoyed.  The free soup is a bit difficult to judge. It sort of tasted like a pork-bone based soup, though the colour was very opaque, the flavour was very light and you could taste hints of water added afterwards. I'm not sure if that's how it's supposed to taste but it wasn't anything special.  Portion size was massive (enough for two, maybe three), but flavour wasn't there. They also charged $7, which does not seem consistent with the advertised price. I just assumed they included tip.  Don't know if this kind of experience is only with their deals."}
{"text":"Very plain dim sum, nothing fancy at all..was a bit disappointed.  As Yelp describes it: \"A-OK.\""}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Rol Jui through my girlfriend's family, it's here that we've been coming for years to have family dinners for all sorts of special occasions like birthdays and holidays. The restaurant is always filled and the food is very consistent.  Dishes always come out piping hot, and are always tasty. Though I don't always know what the dishes we order are called, I have no problem going through eight of them over the course of a dinner. Even with so many dishes going through the kitchen, service is always great and fast. They've never gotten one of our dishes wrong either which is pretty amazing now that I think about it.  Some of the dishes I first tried at Rol Jui include salt and pepper pork chops which are fried and spicy. They're a common dish at Chinese restaurants, but some serve them with extra fatty or boney piece of pork, Rol Jui's are great. I'm also a fan of the Lemon chicken, and the tapioca desert.  If you are looking for a Chinese restaurant for two people, or 10, then Rol Jui is great."}
{"text":"I really do have a food crush on this place!   I have eaten in this restaurant several times and always have had a good experience.    I love the plastic table clothes, I love the lazy susan and I love the staff. Service is quick and the food comes out quickly too. Staff have always been friendly and helpful. This feels like a family place. The restaurant is clean. I love that the menus are on the walls.    Food - fresh, hot and tasty. The crispy ginger beef is delicious, as are the curries, stir frys, dumplings, sweet and sour. Fried rice dishes are huge! Portions are big, you could easily share a main dish and fried rice between two people.   I need to remember that this place does take out!   Definitely worth a try, certainly one of my preferred places to eat in Chinatown"}
{"text":"This is the Chinese restaurant we always go to.  We really enjoy the Lemon Chicken, Cantonese Noodle Dish, Ginger and Onion Lobster, and Seafood Soup.  We have had probably 5 other dishes and they were all very good as well.  Service is always good (may be because we are regulars) and the beer is cheep.  We got the discount card and always get a percentage off our meal when we pay with cash.  I am taking one star off for the plastic tablecloths."}
{"text":"No where else in Chinatown would I risk a parking ticket for takeout.  Upon entry it looks like any other Chinese food restaurant - with those elusive Chinese only menus on the wall which make you wonder if THAT menu is cheaper and the suspicious yet intriguing tank full of lazy/half dead lobsters.  But don't let that fool you the food here is pretty great. I highly recommend the crab corn soup or the spicy fried squid. The service is quick and friendly and this place is open late!   Its also large and pretty stroller friendly, good to bring a couple in there and the waitresses really love babies and pregnant women!   But if you aren't in the baby way and you're looking for some eats after last call - order their \"cold tea\" which is code for beer in a tea pot."}
{"text":"First off, I have walked by this place many times on Dundas as I head towards the Spadina parts of China Town. Finally decided to give this place a try for dinner one time and because of it's convenient location we came here for dinner again tonight. This is a very lay back Chinese Restaurant with a wide range of choices on their menu. We ordered their dinner for 6 people off of one of the Chinese menus. I think the prices were very reasonable. It was only $89.99 for six items and it comes with soup of the day and Chinese dessert - and this was the seafood dinner for six option. From the six dishes we ordered there was one dish that was Vancouver Crab and steamed fish. Overall great value for what you get and the portions are huge. In terms of the food quality, I would say it good. I think this has become another default dinner place option when we want to get good Chinese food downtown."}
{"text":"Toronto is a tough town for late night eats, but Rol Jui definitely fit the bill! Good food. Fast service. Open late. Fast. Friendly staff. Popular but not too crowded.  Last Saturday night after 11PM was my first visit to Rol Jui, but it won't be my last. We ordered and started getting served within minutes. And the food was good and plentiful!  Recommend: Hot and sour soup. Beef short ribs. Sizzling shrimp hot plate.  Seriously good, fast service, and very nice staff. I will be back."}
{"text":"food was not fresh at all! i ordered one vegetables with meat, the vege was sour. lobster was not fresh too. never go back there anymore"}
{"text":"Amazing Cantonese Chinese food!  Great for seafood lovers as well as those who aren't.  This place smelled so good just as soon as we walked into the place and every single person in our party loved each dish we ordered.  My favorite was a tofu dish and one son simply couldn't stop stuffing his mouth with the fried shrimp while the other was hoarding the dumplings because they were so good.  This place was super yummy with lots of options that will make any type of foodie happy.  Our party consisted of vegetarians, meat eaters, seafood lovers, non-seafood lovers, senior Chinese folk who love authentic Chinese food and young Chinese Americans who are pretty Americanized. ;-).  Anyhow, in our strong opinion, this place deserves 5 stars for its delicious food.  It's a pretty sizeable place too.  Not huge but not a hole in the wall.  Just try the place out and you will thank us!  :-)"}
{"text":"so my wife and i had been around this area just the night before or so and we were looking for somewhere to catch a bite.  there is this other place in the city called rol san http://www.yelp.ca/biz/rol-san-restaurant-toronto  which is also chinese and has the same font in its logo.  so we figured if you cant get the first sibling better to date their sister and so we walked in.  so we sat down towards the back, across from the fish tank and were given tea.  now my wifes a vegetarian and i take forever to decide what i want.  she was going to  get a mixed vegetable dish which i could share and some vegetable fried rice, which i could also share.  (my wifes so generous.)  she also got a spring roll.  i didnt.  i didnt because i got the special of the day as an appetizer.  never before, i say, never ever before, have i been treated so attentively at a chinese restaurant before rol jui.  this was almost to a fault.  right when we sat down they were suggesting to me what i should get, whats really good, as if ive never eaten chinese food before.  (harumph!)  well good that they pursued (only closers get coffee!!!) because they sold me a plate of one abalone.  now, kudos to me, for trying it when i still had no idea what the hell it was even after i tried to get them to explain it to me several times.  and kudos to them for making it taste tasty.  abalone is an edible mollusk.  when its one the plate, it looks like a big pig nose but without the nostrils.  now before i got it, they came over and gave me a fork and A KNIFE.  i thought (harumph!!) not only do they think i need a fork instead of chopsticks (whitie!!) but i look so dismal that they cracked open the box of steak knives just so i would know how to eat.  well indeed, a fork and a knife was needed.  without it, you can picture a scenario of two things:  either i manage somehow to pick the abalone up with my chopsticks, only for it to go flying across the room to land in someones blouse or simply to drop on my lap.  the other scenario is using the fork and trying to take a bite, but needing my wife to help me by pulling the back of my head away from the abalone so i could extract a bite.  needless to say...it was tough and needed a steak knife from every angle.  AND IT WAS GOOD.    after that i plunged into a dish of shrimp in lobster sauce.  (now thats something that is better about being the only carnivore at the table.  if you can manage to choose a dish that you love...THEN ITS ALL FOR YOU.) ...jeez...i sure feel bad about saying that now...food is only good when you can share it (slap on the wrist jimi).  as i write i remember that i also had an ooey gooey soup...something like chicken and fish maw soup...which i now understand after looking up \"maw\" in the dictionary, to mean that i had fish jaw or fish throat soup with chicken.  go ahead say it.  ewwwhhh.  well all that was on the table was really tasty, especially with a little of that sinister chili sauce dripped on it.    to round out the night they tried to sell us a membership card!!!  20 bucks for ten percent off for the rest of your life!!!!  we opted out, but were impressed nonetheless."}
{"text":"Since my friend took me to this place months ago, I have become regular visitor. The food is always delicious, fresh, and really yummy. The service is fantastic. The staff is very friendly and welcoming.  Plus, absolutely love their steamed fish and free range chicken."}
{"text":"An authentic Chinese restaurant.  There were huge menus on the walls with mouth-watering pictures of menu items.  Maybe because it was we were all Asian, or maybe because we ordered in Chinese, but the waiter didn't offer to suggest anything to us or offered us forks - which I think is probably more of a positive thing.  The service was good for a Chinese restaurant, the waiters asked us if we needed white rice and served the soup for us when it came out.  We had the seafood & fish maw soup, spicy beef and scallop & veggie dish (all with white rice).  It was all very good, and reasonably priced.  I would recommend this restaurant.  The reason for only 3 star is that there was not one particular thing that popped out, when compared with other Chinese restaurant's I've been to.  I also don't like how there are bugs in the red vinegar (but this is very typical of the vinegar in Chinese restaurants that keep the vinegar on the table).  The decor is also not that nice, but better than most Chinese restaurants that are owner owned."}
{"text":"Delicious chicken dumplings!  Deliciously pan fried with the correct crispness and flavor.  The waitress was exceptionally friendly.  We stumbled upon this gem while walking through China Town.  Would go back again."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever! Seafood is frozen when advertised as fresh. Dishes were oily and covered with msg. Staff were pushy and rude. Had to ask three times for tea and the restaurant was empty. Sounds of arguing amongst staff and kitchen made the experience very uncomfortable. When received the bill I was charged for phantom dishes and had to argue for corrections to be made. Was denied washroom privileges after meal even as a customer! Won't be going back ever."}
{"text":"Greeted by enthusiastic waitresses as my friends and I stepped into this restaurant one evening.  Menus on the wall, plastic tablecloth, seems like a typical Chinese restaurant.  Their kitchen is in the basement, and food is transported via a dumbwaiter.   We ordered Beef and Choi Sum, Braised Pork with Preserved Vegetable, and Eggplants with Minced Pork en Casserole.  The meal came with complimentary Pork and Vegetable Soup, and Red Bean and Tapioca for dessert.  All the dishes were delicious, although the Braised Pork tasted a little different than what I'm used to.  It was less spicy and had spinach underneath the meat.  This dish took a while to make, so make sure you put this order in when you first arrive, as our friendly waitress suggested.   Meal was satisfactory, price was great, staff was welcoming, will come back for other dishes in the future."}
{"text":"Fine, fine Chinese seafood restaurant.  I was there at relatively off times 1:30 and 3 pm and it wasn't crowded.  The staff were friendly and attentive.  The waitress also described my choices as among her favorites, but then...  On one visit I had the Steamed Lobster with Ginger and Onions, the Crab and Fish Maw Soup and the Stuff Crab Claws.  All wonderful.  On the second visit Steamed Sea Bass with Ginger and Onions.  Also excellent.  They have a pretty extensive menu but since this restaurant specializes is seafood that's what I wanted to try.  Chinatown in Toronto is at least as good as its counterpart in New York.  Lots of choices.  I will return."}
{"text":"Fuck is Susan ever lazy.... but if you like Lazy Susan you'll love Rol Jui. Open most nights until 5am, this is easily my go late night (early morning) to china town eatery and as you've guessed it they have lazy susans on their tables.  The place seems pretty ghetto once your start to deconstruct your surroundings. We have faded pictures of food blown up and mounted on the walls, the white garbage bag table cloths and the giant fish tanks with mammoth fish that often throw themselves against the tank (and scare the shit out of me every time!) The best or worse part is the cleanup... the waitress just grabs all four garbage bag table cloth corners and carries the plates and utensils in a makeshift bag-cluster to the back room (seriously I wish I could do this at home!)  Now on to the food, which is delicious! I usually get the squid and crab corn chowder. The portions are large and made for sharing so bring friends and don't sit near the fish tank if you get startled easily!"}
{"text":"Anywhere where Lazy Susan dominates the scene is A OK by me.   I popped in here after an event with some buddies and ordered way too much of the good stuff. We were a motley crew of two big dudes, a pregnant lady, a small lady and a vegan. We went through the gamut of the usual goodness from hot and sour soup, to dumplings, to veggies, to fried rice, to meat dishes and back again. All of it was decent, and the staff was lovely.   My favourite part of the evening was when a table mate ordered a vodka soda, and the language barrier made it slightly challenging. Our server then went and brought over a bottle of vodka to make sure she understood and free poured her drink. Awesome."}
