{"text":"Food is ok, price is right. Very good service. It is not the best Italian food but is certainly a very good option if you are on the run.  Tiramisu is actually very good! Apple and blueberry cakes are also a must try!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food! I had soup, vegetarian sandwich and coffee... It's been a while that I didn't enjoy such a fresh and delicious sandwich... The coffee was really good. I didn't try the sweets and cakes, but they looked delicious. The place is small, clean and casual. If you decide to walk along the river and have a nice breakfast or lunch, or some tea or coffee, I extremely recommend it... :) It also has a very decent free wifi... :)"}
{"text":"Eatalie is probably the best spot in Lachine. Their sandwiches are a must and their coffee is quite good!"}
{"text":"The food here is super good, the owner and head chef is a super cute old Italian guy. I'm not much of a fan of Italian food but this guy LOVES to cook and loves having people in his little restaurant. Everything here is handmade for no reason other than I think he just really really likes to cook for people. Meatballs, marinara sauce, cookies, bread and everything else that would be super easy to cut corners and cheap out on, is home made here.   There is a lot of staples that never change and are always good. However he is always trying something new and something delicious. He loves giving away these free samples for feedback when you buy lunch here. It's always a fun experience having sit down lunch here or grabbing a low cost sandwich to go!"}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday for brunch. Sandwich is exceptionally good. Portion is big, the 6 inch is enough for two girls to share. Got a nice view of the river and the park across the street from the terrace."}
{"text":"Imagine you are taking a stroll along the St Lawrence river in Lachine on a beautiful spring day. You feel like having a good cappuccino and suddenly you find \"Eatalie\" (a somewhat suspicious pun) on a side street. A small Italian place wit a few tables and a large display counter, they obviously cater to a transient crowd that a drawn by the affordable option of this place with affable staff.  I had my cappuccino to go but could not resist to pair it with a just-in-time filled cannoli and that made up for perfect mid-day snack. They advertise that they will offer Italian style (soft serve) ice cream soon (late spring 2015).  A good stop in the area."}
{"text":"If you want to gran some great food and have a picnic on the lachine canal this place is perfectly located to do that! Stop there yesterday picked up their chicken sandwich and you have such lovely choices as toppings for your sandwich. My fiancee loved it and hes quite the critic with food. So that was definetly worth the stop and the money. Got some fries to go with and a nice homemade strawberry cheese cake was sweet and delicious. They also have Brio drinks which is nice to see as a little Italian treat. They forgot to give me my pizza that i asked but the sandwich saved the day we were able to share it and save on the calories!!! Lovely place to stop at for a quick bite and sit down on their terrace."}
{"text":"Wow. Just had the worst experience at this restaurant where I go regularly. As I was about to pay my $60 order (some to go, some to eat on the spot), after repeating it a few times, I asked the cashier about the price of one item, which seemed more expensive than at previous times. She answered rudely, pointed to the board and asked whether I wanted to speak to the manager. I said of course not. But he came out and asked what the problem was. I politely asked whether prices had gone up and he rudely answered that no they hadn't and returned to the kitchen. As I was about to pay I said that I felt like they were being a bit rude. The cashier said that I was being rude so I said I would like to cancel everything and leave. The manager came out and yelled that he didn't need my money and that he had to turn down business since they were doing so well. Wow, I have been going there ever since they opened, and this is pretty much the worst and most random experience I have ever had. Clearly, never again."}
