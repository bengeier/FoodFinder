{"text":"This is the best mexican food place no doubt I would recommend this place to anyone they have the best shrimp burrito they are one of the best things I have tasted in my life 
The only thing that sucks it that they only accept cash and it is small place and it is not fancy or nice but good food no doubt"}
{"text":"Great food, really nice waitress, and great pricing. The Torta was delicious and my friends got the giant Burrito Macho which they really enjoyed. Doesn't look like much from the outside (we drove by it the first time by mistake), but has plenty of seating and was a great lunch."}
{"text":"This place is quickly becoming my go to after work spot  to get some good home style Mexican food. It's a \"no frills\" hole in the wall , mom and pop, home style type restaurant. I hope that made sense. Everything they make is fresh and made with lots of care. Bring cash cuz they don't take credit cards at the time of this review."}
{"text":"Wonderful tacos. My favorite was the carnitas but the other two I had (birria and pastor) were delicious too. Nothing fancy about this place, just tasty inexpensive food. The lone salsa was great; mild yet flavorful."}
{"text":"Delicious food and quality stuff. The pastor tacos are amazing. The only down side is the salsa. I know some people like the style, I think it has mango or something in it, but to me it was awful. If they had another option for salsa, like a good traditional red, this place would be an easy 5 stars. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"El Burrito Grande, which translates to The Large Burrito, has the best Mexican food in the South-of-I-10-&-West-of-the-17 quadrant. The place is tiny and tucked off Buckeye with a very small parking lot. It's hot inside and the decor is pretty much reflective of the industrial area in which is operates. But the food is excellent and the service is friendly. It's funny because, if you head east a few blocks, you'll always see the rush of yuppies coming outside their downtown perimeter to 'go ethnic' for weekday lunches. I've sat in the restaurants and heard countless times, often from a young professional with a pastel dress shirt and a lanyard displaying his laminated ID card, that \"I know it doesn't look like much but this place has the best mexican food!\" 

Except those places don't have the best mexican food, EBG does. It's just that they're another 3 minutes from Pastel Professional's office and he's only got an hour lunch break, not 66 minutes. 

Tortas, wet burros, tacos...you name it. Their salsas are great and their grilled vegetables are always on point. I'd make a destination lunch of EBG but, at least, if you are in the area then you should consider stopping by and sampling their menu."}
{"text":"First time here, definitely coming back, fabulous burrito!!!  Exceptional tortilla!  I had the chile rojo-  tasty, not very spicy but they have great salsa on the table.  No sign out front, its the pink building.  Nice people and pleasant atmosphere."}
