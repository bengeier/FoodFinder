{"text":"This place is great if you don't like acidic coffee. Personally, I can't take caffeine very well because it literally hurts my stomach when I drink too acidic coffee, so Nespresso is a good fit for me except for the large price tag... But I tend to go once in awhile to let myself indulge.  The classic espresso that my hubby always gets is superb. I say this because the crema in the espresso is phenomenal. Their indulgent coffee creations are great even though it's really expensive - the cup is actually really big, almost the size of a grande/venti at Starbucks. You can pair your indulgent creation with 2 macarons/pastry for an extra $2, adding up to ~$10.  The foam on top of your indulgent creation/cappuccino is really like no other at Nespresso. It's legit foam; it holds its shape very well but it's still very delicate at the same time. If you're on the fence about buying a Nespresso machine, give their boutique cafes a shot before making your purchase! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"When you first step in, you are greeted by their forever tall ceilings and open spaces. You can sit wherever you like, or wait until one of their hosts escorts you, whichever you prefer. One of the reasons why I love Toronto's Nespresso boutique in Yorkville is because it has such a high ceiling! Personally, I love high ceilings because they can really change up a room's atmosphere and style. It makes me more relaxed.  The waiter or waitress brings some ice water with lemon for you to drink while you look at the menu.   If you're familiar with Nespresso's coffee lines, they offer all of their types available which differ based on the intensity, key aromatic note, and size of cup. There is also a decaffeinated version for those who prefer decaf.   According to my husband, the coffee tastes amazing. Since we don't like acidic tasting coffee, Nespresso is a good fit for us. The price of the drinks at Nespresso are more expensive than those at independent or local cafes, but we tend to still go  to Nespresso for a variety of reasons.   As for me, the dulce le leche coffee was great. I usually get their hazelnut hot chocolate coffee, which is equally good, but sometimes I prefer something with caramel instead of chocolate. This dulce le leche coffee was perfect. For serious coffee drinkers, it wouldn't suffice. As my husband always says, \"too sweet!\""}
{"text":"It was a cool place, coffee was made to perfection. Ordered the yogurt with fruit. The Carmel drizzled over was a nice touch of sweetness.  I own one. Can never get my froth like theirs. Maybe cause they use real cream. But......  No \"to go\" cups....  Still got my Caffeine on."}
{"text":"Lunch: mediocre soup that lacked squash flavour but delicious croque Madame sandwich.  My friend'a quiche was also stellar. The ambiance is light and airy and modern. The service was attentive and unobtrusive. The coffee was good but didn't knock my socks off and for $5 really should come with a chocolate or similar treat. I would come back for a get together with girl friends and the experience."}
{"text":"Nespresso just opened in Montreal, same concept than in New York.  The place is stylish and you can have a coffee at the Bar on the ground floor and then buy your pods at the boutique on the first floor. First the coffee is excellent, it comes from the small pods and you can have some nice food as well. Seconf, you can buy the machine for your home (it is their objective of course) and then buy your pods online or in the location. A good place to have a good espresso, latte or Cappuccino , the only small negative, you can feel from the service that the place is new."}
{"text":"Cafe with beautiful decor with a Nespresso shop at the back where you can purchase the machines and pods. The shop also offers complimentary espressos and cappuccinos for you to try and I must say they taste just like getting them from cafes! There's no limit to how many you can try either, so I was able to get a taste of couple flavours which was great. My friend purchased two packs of pods at around $8/10 which we both think is pretty reasonably priced.  We wanted to try out the cafe as well, but unfortunately there was a wait and we didn't have enough time. Am definitely planning on coming back to try that out."}
{"text":"This place had the audacity to charge me $5 for an espresso that a machine made completely. Was the drink terrible? No, but it wasn't good. And whats with all the guys standing around in suits? Nespresso pays these people to just stand there and pretend like they're guarding a bank. They dont even have cups to let you take your coffee to go. I don't get the appeal to this place. I will say though that the service is very friendly. But please, Save your money and go to zaza."}
{"text":"I've had the Nespresso Citiz Frother Combo with N36 wooden case, since it was launched and it's simply the best residential unit out there when combined with the high-quality 100% recylable Nespresso capsules. I'm digging the sustainable-organic-coffee-limited-edition capsule, right now! If you ask me, \"Do not buy any other residential unit for this price range\". I rate the PRODUCT: 5 STARS. ONLINE SERVICE, DELIVERY and SUPPORT: 5 STARS. Don't bother with the 2 Star boutique upstairs! It's a waste of time, unless you absolutely need a specific Nespreso product for a last minute dinner party (i.e. like more accessories or a display case). Usually women, experience more bitchy service than men at this boutique- for what reason? Your guess is as good as mine. But generally speaking, the service is... well... un service de merde, because you never know how it will go (50:50). So, as my mentor used to say, \"Don't knock something, unless you can offer an improvement\". So, here it is: Buy your Nespresso machine from Deco Decouverte, it comes with free assorted capsules to hold you off until you order your N36 wooden case which comes with even more free capsules, then order online what you need based on your preferences. The delivery service is impeccable- your product will arrive in 2-3days tops: no joke. And the service support is extremely friendly over the phone- I had an irregualr issue with my milk frother and they just sent me a new one. No questions asked. And to top it all off- here is the ultimate tip: twice a year, Deco decouverte offers a limited-time 10-20% coupon on ANY item in the store. Two years ago I landed on a 20% coupon... guess what I used it on? The guy in-line behind me freaked-out and bought one himself when he saw how I was applying it. It's all about the dealz!!! [I have nothing to say about the bar downstairs- besides: nice chill terrace in the spring/summer, with overpriced food/drinks (but then again, it wouldn't be a nice, chill Cresent St. terrace if it wasn't expensive to sit there. The crowd of customers is a tad stuffy, so make sure you go with good company to distract you from the pomp-fest, if u do decide to hangout there]"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite coffee shop/dessert all time with my girlfriend!  My dream is to open a small cafe! And this place always amaze us with variety of selection of expresso and latte!  And their dessert?! It is homemade that makes it too good! Almond tart? So good Pear tart with caramelized pear on top? One of my favorite   Can't wait to go back with my girlfriend!"}
{"text":"You can't do better than Nespresso...nice place delicious coffee...staff a bit slow with taking orders and delivering the bill, that would be my only complaint."}
{"text":"I love my espresso machine and the coffee but the staff in this shop behave like snobs and it's unnecessary. They aren't selling $4000 hand bags they are selling coffee. These people need a serious attitude adjustment. I'd rather order on-line."}
{"text":"Funky coffee place in yorkville. Definitely worth going in  To see how they transformed movie theatre into store front. The food could have been a little tastier ."}
{"text":"In a sense a partially hidden gem, the Nespresso Boutique is a welcome rest stop from museums, shopping and more intense Bloor West street. The café is located behind Bloor street near Cumberland and close to the 'rock pile' and park. The staff are excellent and give you space and time to enjoy your coffee.   The decor is sophisticated on many levels and yet comfortable casual.  Even the sound experience has been acoustically tuned to provide calm ambience in the midst of an otherwise charged area. A great place with friends or family for coffee."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  Sitting at the bar, we got to witness the barista at work and man, did he take the job seriously.  You would think that just pressing a button to make the coffee would make things simple, but the care used and combinations created made for a fine art.  You get the full selection of Nespresso coffees for each of the desserts so the possibilities are endless.  I went for the simple espresso, after being guided through which kind would best suit my pallet.  My friends went for coffee ice cream blends, and I have to admit I was a little bit jealous.   They ambiance was elegant, and the patio was beautiful.  A great place for visitors to the city to take a break from sight seeing, or for regulars to take a classy break from the day."}
{"text":"Fraîchement arrivé à Toronto, la boutique Nespresso a décidé de s'implanter dans le quartier huppé de Yorkville. On dirait une bijouterie, un magasin de luxe, un café interplanétaire, le hall d'arrivée d'un aéroport ... Mais on y vend du café, des machines pour faire du café, des capsules pour faire du café.   Mais où est donc mon ami Georges Clooney ?"}
{"text":"Why would you go here for Espresso when Caffe Art Java exists in Montreal?  Ya, please serve me some espresso from a pod...good? lol"}
{"text":"I went there to have my breakfast a very quite atmosphere there was outdoor tables & the place inside was so pleasing about the food there wasn't a variety chooses however,the coffee was awesome and strong taste. I really enjoyed the place."}
{"text":"Well I am not a big coffee drinker but I just love the Nespresso Cafe in Montreal. Unlike a typical cafe's, I found this place more unique with their elegant interior and colorful furniture. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Want to feel like a prince or princess even if you can only afford to dress like the peasantry? This place is for you.  I'm a biker at heart and come in jeans and leathers, and they greet me just as delightedly as they do Yorkville hoity toities, with smiles that are really genuine.  The manager, a man with a French accent like warm, sweet, pure maple syrup, and the face of a (lightly-bearded) cherub, is happy to go to the trouble of grabbing boxes of things to show to you or talk to you about the latest flavours. The sparkle in his eyes says he loves what he does and the ease and happiness on his staff's faces and in their interactions says they like working for him.  I don't feel the need to speak on the espresso/coffee. That's really a personal taste and I happen to love it.  Their café food is really just meant as a showcase for the espressos/coffees, but what a gorgeous and yummy show it makes! Ingredients are natural, high quality, and with artistic presentation. It's a delicious joy. My personal favourite is the Croque Monsieur,  lovely thick-sliced sweet ham on challa bread with a truffled sauce, and Gruyere cheese melted to the outside of the bread. I always get the soup option with it and am never disappointed or left hungry.  Prices are, well, Yorkvillian, but reasonable for what you get.  Be clean, be kind, and have a wonderfully special time, feeling as appreciated as any Ritzy-Bitzy High-Dinky-Doo better'n'you that walks in off Cumberland. ;)  Also know that if I take you here sometime, I must think VERY highly of you. I reserve this for only the VERY BEST people I know and care about. :)"}
{"text":"I received a machine as a gift. The staff here is so rude and snotty it's ridiculous. Like, you sell instant coffee, get over yourselves. Also my milk frother broke and they were of no assistance. I hate companies that don't even try to problem solve. Lazy arrogant staff. Would it kill you to smile?!?!"}
{"text":"Nespresso Bar is an elegantly decorated, brightly lit, large coffee shop in Yorkville. It offers numerous couches and seating areas, catering well to groups of 2-4 people. I don't recommend working at this place as it is busy and quite loud.   The customer service is excellent as all the staff are very effecient, friendly and knowledgable on the coffee.   The food is mostly all French. It's pretty good and is a little pricey.   Finally, the drinks are quite good. They offer their premium 21 Grand CRU coffees, espressos and espresso based drinks. Since they're premium beverages the prices are a little steeper ($4-8.00)  OVERALL Atmosphere: elegant, brightly lit, busy, good for social meetings  Prices: Coffee is a little more expensive than Starbucks ($4-8.00)   Cuisine: French cuisine  Customer Service: Excellent - efficient and friendly"}
{"text":"Had a croissant and coffee for breakfast as  I was shopping nearby.   The seating is super comfortable and the service is excellent. The prices are very reasonable and competitive. It's the same price or cheaper than starbucks with better food and seating.   I frequent the nespresso boutiques often to restock on capsules and the service is always excellent, the same can be said at the cafe. Always treated like a VIP unlike many of the other places on blood."}
{"text":"Absolument magnifique ! La boutique Nespresso du centre-ville est situé sur la rue Crescent, au coin de Maisonneuve. Au rez-de-chaussée il y a un café où vous pouvez vous faire servir des cafés et boissons à base de café-capsules Nespresso. À l'entrée, il y a toujours quelqu'un pour vous accueillir et vous diriger.  Au 2e étage, c'est la boutique en tant que tel. Vous débarquez dans le monde ultra classe de Nespresso. Le mur de capsules colorées vous montre la qualité, la variété et l'opulence qui caractérise la marque.   Vous pouvez essayer les grands crus et les nouveautés durant votre magasinage (servi par un vendeur tout droit issu du vieux continent)  et même tester certaines machines qui sont en exposition. Vous pouvez acheter la machine elle-même, des tasses, pots de rangements, étuis, soucoupes, etc. Aussi, c'est ici qu'il vous faut ramener vos capsules usagées pour qu'elles soient acheminées au centre de recyclage.    Lors de l'achat, on vous créé un compte avec vos informations et vos saveurs préférées, de sorte que si vous voulez acheter pour votre conjoint ou autre, Vous ne pouvez pas vous tromper !  Vous pouvez commander par internet ou bien en boutique.  Mon seul bémol est que c'est très petit. C'est TOUJOURS plein. Veuillez prévoir 20-30 minutes d'attente pour passer à la caisse les jours de fin de semaine."}
{"text":"Coffee is always good, the service is great and the sweets they have make for a perfect afternoon coffee break if you feel like spending just a bit more on your coffee."}
{"text":"Fancy Nespresso boutique is here! You can recycle your capsules at the door. You can go to the far back to purchase your goods and try their coffees for free. The front of the building is all cafe style so just seat yourselves and wait for someone to bring you a menu.  Most of their coffees start at $7.50 for hor or cold. They serve breakfast goods and lunch goods. Their macaroons are $2.50 a piece or $13.50 for half a dozen or you can order a dozen. Their lobster panini is pretty good for under $15 you get a panini with a lot of lobster and choice of salad or soup.   Great service, treat you like a high end coffee drinker. I would definitrly come back for the food, surrounding and service :) coffee though i can make at home since I have teo machines ... haha"}
{"text":"Overrated. The flavoured based drinks are nice, but far too expensive. As far as actual coffee quality...blah. Way above average for pod based coffee but nothing compared to the real thing. Far too expensive. I'd take an independent coffee house that sells a decent manually freshly ground and roasted flat white or americano any day!"}
{"text":"Service WAY too slow. Staff ignore customers! Left a bad taste in my mouth, even more so than the subpar coffee."}
{"text":"The coffee is very good and the presentation is usually very nice. I have ordered some food before, but I recommend just a coffee break. The staff are nice, although some I've found to be less than adequately attentive. It depends who you get. It is expensive, so if you know that going in, you won't get any surprises!   The atmosphere is what I enjoy most at this particular location. It has beautiful decor and lighting; very classy, and it makes you feel that way as well!"}
{"text":"One of my fave places in montreal to chill with friends and pretend to be rich and not have to work. The drinks are a bit more expensive than other coffee shops, but the quality of it and the nice decor of the place compensates for it. They also have food such as macarons, verrines, salads, etc.   If you have free time with your friends or a date but dont want to go to a normal coffee shop to chill, this place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"The drinks are ok (expect higher end pricing being in Yorkville). Service is amazing. But the internet sucks! So if you're planning to do work that requires internet, don't bother here.  The wifi doesnt connect well. And when connected, some sites dont work. It keeps redirecting to the Nespresso landing page to connect when I'm already connected and other websites are working. I even showed this to staff and they said they don't know what to do about it."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. Pricey because of location but loved the drinks and the macarons. The environment is perfect for patio season and the staff is just on point. Not overly friend as it is yorkville after all but not too snooty that I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Came here around noon on a Sunday. It wasn't too busy. At the end of the day this is still the Nettle company so I don't know why it's so pricey.   Pros: - Nice ambiance   Cons: - Pricey for the quantity offered."}
{"text":"Uniformly charming, with a mid-century modern sensibility. Despite the potentially frosty nature of that aesthetic, it manages to be both warm and clean in feel.  The coffee itself is quite good and if you ask very nicely, they'll do a decent impression of a Cubano-style espresso. So far, it's the best one that I've had in town."}
{"text":"You won't find finer food and coffee downtown with this ambience and value. The city's young and less young professionals make Nespresso a go-to stop on their afternoon outings downtown. An addition to a great afternoon at the museum or shopping at Holt Renfrew nearby."}
{"text":"Nespresso, you so yummy.  Pretentious or not, I dig it. This place is swanky, classy, and sophisticated. Yes, you are going to spend at least $5-6 on a coffee, but take in to consideration the variety, the ambiance, the area, the experience... and it could be worth it. If not, well, there are a bunch of great cheap coffee houses elsewhere, too.  Their food is quite good as well, having only tried their Salmon Tartare and Caesar Salad, I must say I have never been disappointed. Their tartare is served with a syringe full of balsamic and olive oil to eject over the salmon, which is a pretty interesting touch I have never experienced elsewhere. Their macaron's are good, and they offer a variety of other sweet goodies to sample and/or order.  The place is very sleek and clean, and the servers are attentive and kind. If you happen to buy your espresso capsules from there, then they store your information in their system, making the process quite easy and convenient for future purchases - they recycle the capsules too! Their espresso makers are top of the line, ranging in prices and styles according to your needs. For any fix ups or replacements on machines, they work hard and efficiently at taking care of your needs."}
{"text":"Nespresso cafe used to market their coffee machine pods.  It's cavernous once you go inside, something you don't realize at all from the outside storefront. They also serve yummy pastries and other dessert items. Great fast service."}
{"text":"I prefer Nespresso coffee over Keurig or Tassimo, and it's exciting that it's now so accessible in Toronto. After trying a couple of samples at the Nespresso Boutique Store at the Eaton's Center, I was curious to see what the sit-down cafe in Yorkville would offer.  Located on Cumberland, the new Nespresso Boutique Bar is about 14,000 sqft. It's a very modern, open-concept cafe with a separate sit down and coffee bar area, as well as the boutique at the back with all the different machines and coffee capsules. This is not your typical cozy European-style Cafe where you grab an espresso and ponder how your day will go. Did you forget this is Yorkville? This must be the new place to see or be seen because at $7 a latte, I hope the paparazzi are outside waiting to snap my photo.  Don't get me wrong--the space is beautiful, the staff is lovely and aesthetically speaking--It is wonderful; however, I wouldn't come here regularly for the coffee or for the lattes. Perhaps I would come to sample--for free. They have got nothing on \"real\" coffee spots such as Sam James, Lit or Fahrenheit Coffee."}
{"text":"I do visit the Nespresso bar quite regularly because I have a machine at home that requires the pods, but it doesn't end there. When you walk in to the nicely designed cafe you are greeted with a smile and the host there is SO good at what she does.   The coffee bar provides snacks and drinks and they are made with perfection.   Their take away cups are the best I've ever seen, how they make money on those, I don't know!!  The only downside is that it is hard to get a table on a rainy Sunday afternoon (as I recently found out) all in all, the service is fantastic, the coffee is expertly created and the space is very well designed"}
{"text":"Very happy with Nespresso! What a beautiful interior. Makes for a very relaxing and luxurious atmosphere. Full service and a great menu!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out last night for the first time, and was pleasantly surprised. First, the interior decor is stunning - a mixture of contemporary and urban design, with a little sleekness to boot. They also have a small terrace if you prefer to sit outside.   Our waiter was extremely attentive and as this was my first visit, he took the time to thoroughly explain the menu and various types of coffee. I took the waiter up on his recommendation and ordered the Macchiato, and was NOT disappointed. I ordered the 'light' version and found it to be a perfect blend of both milk and coffee, without being too coarse. Frankly, it was delicious. My only 'complaint' - if you want to call it that - is that there was too much foam. Since I forgot to request no foam, I don't blame the waiter :)  They have a fairly extensive coffee menu so if you're a fan of coffee, you're sure to find something. They also offer food service, however since I didn't order anything, I can't comment on how good the food might be.   An additional perk for me is that they serve Point G macarons - WOOHOO!   Great place to chill on your own or with a few friends. Check it!"}
{"text":"The staff is always professional. There is a great selection of coffee and food. We went there for breakfast and everyone was satisfied. The smoked salmon bagel and the bircher muesli were incredible. The bircher comes with a delicious blueberry muffin - make sure to save some space for the muffin, it is absolutely worth it."}
{"text":"Awkward encounter. The person making my drink sat there talking to a customer rather than making my drink. Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I am a total nespresso junkie, so need to come here on a regular basis to buy capsules to get my fix.  The sales boutique is on the second floor, with capsules, machines and accessories.  I've always gotten excellent service every time I've been here.  Sometimes there's a line for capsules, but they bring you coffee and chocolate while you wait  which definitely makes you less impatient.  Downstairs is the cafe, I've never tried the food but have had delightful fancy coffee drinks there a few times.  It's very elegant and the service is good."}
{"text":"Nice place to come and chill over coffee and a snack! The staff are really friendly and the area is spacious. My partner and I had coffees and shared a BLT and soup - they offered to split it on two plates for us. The pricing is average, not bad considering the area and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"So classy, so beautiful, so enjoyable. We went for a morning breakfast since I had a voucher card from the Taste of Toronto festival earlier in the summer. This is the first time that I got more than what I expected with a voucher, how unexpected! It said two coffees and two pastries, but the server invited us to order anything from the breakfast or even the lunch menu, since it was nearing 11 am. For a cafe in Yorkville, I was thrilled that we were treated so nicely. Because of this, I'd definitely consider visiting the Nespresso Cafe again to stock up on pods for family members, or to enjoy a fancy drink with a friend. The prices for food weren't outrageous, and I really enjoyed my grilled cheese with figs and balsamic vinaigrette. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Simply my favorite coffee place in Monteal and I really do enjoy their light original breakfast combinations!!! Ambiance and decor is amazing. As long as you don't mind the staff giving themselves an attitude"}
{"text":"What a gorgeous relaxing oasis in the middle of Yorkville. I usually visit the store twice a month to buy pods and the relaxing atmosphere to sit and have a wonderful coffee is beautiful the Decour is very modern and loads of seating."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Gorgeous decor and interior. I was here with someone in the even around lunch time and it was the perfect place to go for a classy quick bite. Walking in, we didn't know what to expect but this is a full-service cafe style establishment so just go in, grab a seat and they will come to you.  ------About the service------ 5/5 fantastic waiters. Very professional and courteous; only checking in to see how everything was doing and was extremely polite. Tip them well !   ------About the food------ My first intent when searching for a place to eat was something that would not be heavy on the stomach. This fits the criteria very well, and then some. We ordered the avocado salad and the quinoa salad. Both were fantastic and refreshing. I ordered the quinoa and she ordered the salad (which is more refreshing in my opinion.) They also had a wide range of espresso drinks, all looked good but I went with the chai coffee (5/5). Very hot to pick up but no regrets. They provide you with extra sugar but they made it perfectly anyway so none was needed.  Overall, a nice place to chit chat/relax on a lunch break or even a lazy sunday. Would come back again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Love this place.  This is where I get my hits. Those pods keep me alive.   I haven't tried the cafe downstairs so cannot comment.  99% of the time when I am there, they give me a free espresso when I'm waiting in line. If they don't give me one, I ask for one. That is why I am taking 1 star off - because to get 5/5, it has to be perfect.  I don't notice a pretentious air about the place like some reviewers say. It is just the Nespresso brand that they are selling and they do a very good job. It is so tight and together.   I like watching the Nespresso propaganda on the screen behind the counter - the video advertisements. Today there was one of a blue bird dropping an orange pod into the machine. It was nice and made me happy.   Some people don't go to the store and order online. I like to save the shipping fee and get the free espresso each time I come here and step into the Nespresso world just for a few minutes."}
{"text":"Gosh I am IN LOVE with this place.... Relaxed atmosphere, don't feel like I am rushed to leave, big windows letting the sun shine in. Just everything.   When I first walked in, I was unsure of whether I walked into a hotel lobby or a coffee shop - the place is grande, with luxurious decor and couches, and was instantly welcomed with friendly staff. It even had an iPad lounge (reminded me of the airport). Half of it is a sit down place while another half is a boutique shop for Nespresso machines. I was seated in a two person table and was given cold lemon water to enjoy while browsing the menu.   Their drink menu was clearly dedicated to coffee and it took me forever to decide on one. My boyfriend ordered the iced coffee (topped with two scoops of vanilla ice cream and chocolate bites)... yes, he was drawn by the idea of ice cream on coffee. I, on the other hand, ordered the hazelnut hot chocolate ( both priced at $7.50), Both drinks came with a mini swiss chocolate (which was delicious!) After trying both (although not the wisest choice to mix cold and hot drinks together) , I was completely satisfied with both our choices. At that time, we haven't eaten lunch yet so we ordered two entreees - the quiche with the side salad and the chicken pesto wrap with a side soup (averaged around $15/ entree). Oh.. also, glanced the menu and they had macarons for $3 (would not get because Morocco Chocolat and other specialty cafes  around the corner) and desserts such as coffee caramel brulee (hoping to during my next visit!).    Overall the food was good (but nothing spectacular and incredibly overpriced) , but I would definitely come back to try out more of their coffee choices!"}
{"text":"The MOST pretentious coffee shop I have ever been to. Unlike most of their newly launched stores around the world Nescafe has decided that they would serve both coffee and some food. The coffee comes in pods, the Nespresso pods. The wait staff snooty. I ordered a Machiatto Latte, and was served a Machiatto. When I mentioned that what they served me did not look at all like what I had ordered, I was told \"the menus are printed in Switzerland and the items are not going to be exactly like the menu. I was offered a replacement Machiatto. I drank it to keep the peace, and it was comped. The prices are more than the Cafe de La Paix, but as the waiter proudly exclaimed most of our patrons are Europeans. Overpriced, snooty, and the so called food is nothing other than garbage. Stay away in droves."}
{"text":"Excelente servicio, buena variedad de cafés valientes y fríos. Y un servicio insuperable. Recomendado!!"}
{"text":"Nice place. I went here with a friend because I got a promotional card of free coffee and pastry for 2 ppl at some event.   I had the Bagel and Lox ($12), which was really good and filling. Its Atlantic smoked salmon on a multigrain bagel with cucumbers, shallots, capers, and dill creme cheese. $2 cheaper then the Smoked Salmon Bagel ($14) at the Drake Cafe. Yeah, I love my salmon bagels. Lol. Sooo good and hard to go wrong wherever you decide to dine.   For my drink, I ordered from their speciality menu, limited edition for the holidays. I forgot the name but I will post a picture. My drink was huge but needed a bit of sugar, which they even provided. They also gave me a little Nespresso chocolate which was nice.   I would definitely visit again, I just wish they provided wifi and had more seating. It gets pretty packed in the mornings."}
{"text":"I only give four star because of the lack of WiFi in the boutique. But all the experience was 5star. The coffee was really good, latte nice and tasty. Small selection of deserts but really good quality. Pricy of course but when you walk in you know that it would be pricy. The place is really nice and elegant."}
{"text":"I haven't tried the drinks and food there but this is my rating for their customer service. Came in to buy the Nespresso capsules for my machine at home. There was even a gentleman at the door as soon as you walk in that greets you. They were so helpful and even offer a me an espresso."}
{"text":"The drinks are great. The espresso they make are from the Virtuoline tho... I would prefer the Originaline though. Service is fantastic and food/dessert is well above average. The drinks itself beats anything Starbucks could offer. I would prefer Nespresso every day of the week.  The food is just average at best. Had it been better I would have given it the full 5. Or if food just wasn't an option, maybe also a 5. But the whole overall experience drops to a 4 because food is just average."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a breakfast or brunch place to check out and you forgot to make a reservation or do not want to stand in line, this is a great spot. Their food quality is decent and the old theater high ceilings are awesome (used to be Cumberland theaters).   Great place for brunch/lunch  4.5/5 *"}
{"text":"No need to talk about the Nespresso coffee it speaks for itself as for The dessert  they are just yummy and the staff are very friendly. Just love this place"}
{"text":"This place is stylish and it's like a hotel's lobby lounge. I was greeted by friendly staff once I stepped in.  There are leather chairs and cafe tables on one side and ipad bar on the other.  The chairs are comfy and big enough to put coat and handbag.   It is a great place to relax or chit chat with friends but the drinks and food are a bit pricey.  Drinks are ranging from $5 - $10.  Macaroon is $3 each. They also serve hot food like quiche and sandwich.   I went there on a weekday afternoon.  There weren't too many customers.  We waited about 10 minutes for our coffee and dessert.  There is a showroom for the machines and pods at the back.   The staffs there are very knowledgeable and professional.  You can look at this place as a grand retail shop with a cafe. This cafe is for drink-in only cos they don't have disposable cups."}
{"text":"Wow. I was here today, and their deserts are amazing. The staff are friendly, and it has a warm and comforting atmosphere. That being said, the service can be slow, and they are usually out of popular macaroon flavors. Overall this place is great, and I would come back any day!"}
{"text":"What can I say .. It's Nespresso :) The quality well it's  Nespresso !  Defiantly a place to check out. If you go upstairs u can order the caps and machines. Sometimes you can try different coffees.  I did find the price to be a little high but it is Nespresso !  I found it quiet and relaxing but u think a coffee place that offered a place to sit would have wifi !  I guess the only high tech in there is there machines .."}
{"text":"Je n'avais même jamais remarqué qu'il y avait une Boutique Nespresso sur la rue Crescent, c'est par hasard, que je m'y suis rendue pour que mes amis puissent s'acheter leurs petites capsules pour leur machine. Je dois vous dire: Mais quel accueil chaleureux! À peine arrivé, il nous font déguster l'une de leur nouvelle capsule dont vanille et caramel, le tout amené sur un petit plateau avec sucre, la petite cuillère en argent: la totale quoi ! Personnellement, je ne suis pas du tout une amatrice de café, je n'en consomme d'ailleurs jamais mais là, avec leur dégustation, ils ont la tactique de vente parfaite parce que j'achèterai bien la machine pour me faire mon Nespresso le matin.  De plus, on peut consommer sur place, tout en grignotant un petit truc, d'ailleurs j'ai repéré leurs macarons!  Au lieu, d'aller chez les habituels Starbucks, Second Cup, Van Houtte,...  si vous avez la possibilité d'aller à la boutique Nespresso, n'attendez plus !"}
{"text":"Nespresso is a classy coffee shop. The prices are a bit higher than normal coffees you could get from other cafés or coffee shops around the town but it is worth to try! At least once!   They have wide range of various coffees with different dosages everyone could choose what it is right for them. They have both cold and hot beverages. I got dulce de leche latte and really liked my choice!   The desserts are beyond excellent! I got warm apple crumble pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top! It was so yummy way above my expectation! The garnish of the plate and the pie itself was pretty nice! I have not tried any food there so I have no idea about the taste and quality of them.  The place is very clean and well decorated. They have comfortable couches and the servers are friendly, polite and considerate.   Overall I am satisfied with my experience. It is not an every day coffee shop as the prices are high but you have to give them a try once!"}
{"text":"Ehh, the espresso here was disgusting. The bitter taste lingered in my mouth for so long after each sip.  However, the atmosphere was really good and the service was good as well. The waitress was very friendly."}
{"text":"This is a lofty, modern cafe in the heart of Yorkville. I'm not a coffee drinker, but the teas and food are quite good. The croque Monsieur and quiche were both excellent, although the accompanying butternut squash-apple soup tasted like straight up veggie broth with olive oil poured over it - basically no flavour to speak of. Service is excellent and prices are more reasonable than you'd expect."}
{"text":"Came here in the evening just before close to try some of their specialty coffees. Tried the nutella and chai coffees. Both were delicious and interesting. Service was incredibly friendly and our server brought us extra chocolates."}
{"text":"A coffee shop for high society (or people trying to play the part)?  Maybe?    A lifestyle that the Swiss Nestle company is selling one small aluminum pod at a time?  Perhaps?  This was my second discovery experience at the Nespresso Cafe!  On the main floor is the restaurant/Nespresso bar lounge area. on this day people were enjoying delightful looking breakfast/brunch of different creations while some looked to be enjoying good conversation.  In the back of the first floor is a showroom type area of all the machines you can purchase.    Climb up the stairs into a second showroom area (of their expensive yet sleek-simple) looking accessories and the place to buy your grand cru's.  As I got to the top of the stairs there was a greeter who was asking what I was looking for.  I responded with \"buying capsules\".   There I was told to go to the counter where a young lad helped answer my questions and allowed me to sample the special 2012 cru (Hazelnut).  The advantage here is you can buy one sleeve (of 10 capsules) or as many as you want yet ordering online you are help to the minimum of (5 sleeves of 10 caps which comes with a $7 delivery fee).  Since I don't plan to be here all the time I bought 6 sleeves.  Service was professional and friendly but I can see why some people see this as \"hoity toighty\".  If you can get over this aspect and enjoy the atmosphere you can really have a nice place to come for a java fix or light meal!    I shall be back to re-fuel in the future!"}
{"text":"On a short visit to Montréal I made my first stop was a  visit Nespresso Boutique and it was a great experience, the staff was very helpful and knowledgeable... The food and coffee was amazing... I would definitely recommend Nespresso and I plan to come back on my next visit."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed in the service here. On our first trip to Montreal, me and my husband walked in Nespresso because he wanted a quick espresso. We noticed plenty of staff behind the counter, yet no one greeted us. I ended up asking if we order at the counter or have a seat since no one spoke to us, however, the girl at the register announced that, since they were closing in 10 minutes, they would not serve us. Crazy because we would have been out of there fast since he just wanted a quick caffeine boost, and for them to give us no greeting and not offer us service was very distasteful. Not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Impeccable and friendly service. My cappuccino was perfect and the croissant was heated up very nicely."}
{"text":"I love Nespresso and no matter where I go it's always delicious!!!  I love their coffee I own one of their machines and I love it... Service is always super nice..."}
{"text":"Was walking around in Yorkville and realized that I needed new pods for my machine! I was greeted by a nespresso concierge .. Which made me feel super fancy! She asked if I would like to sit in their café or or make my way back to the store. The cafe and store makes you feel like you're in a cute cafe in Paris ... Spotless, beautiful high ceilings and the staff are beyond helpful! I was helped by a lovely staff member be let me try not 1 but THREE new Nespresso pods, each cup was served with a chocolate, milk, sugar and in a lovely plastic cup.   If you walked into Starbucks you would never get to try a full cup before purchasing one.... Only in nespresso do you get this kinda of customer service. I purchased a few be pods and walked out feeling so happy. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine bought a Nespresso machine and has brought it to the office. I tried one coffee and loved it!! So I went online and looked up for the closest Nespresso store to me. I was excited to learn that there is one located near me, in Yorkville. On a Sunday afternoon I walked over to this store and got in line (the pods can be purchased at the back). Once it was my turn, I was kinda lost. There were so many options, and so I had a few questions. But sadly I got stuck with the worst sales person in the whole store! She looked annoyed, was not particularly eager to answer my questions, while around me people were being treated to coffee, shown around, given an education on the different options.....and I can't figure out why I was getting the crappy service. I was there to buy lots of coffee! So I played it safe and got 4 boxes of the regular coffee - not the flavored one - cause I did not know if I would like it. But in the end, after I paid, and out of sheer frustration, I asked if I could sample a flavored coffee.  Though not excited by my request, my sales person walked me over to the coffee machine, put in the pod quickly and then took off. Another sales person saw me standing there waiting, and she came over to say hi and offered me sugar, milk and a napkin. Now that's service!   Let's just say that Nespresso coffee left a bitter taste in my mouth. I am gonna go back to my old coffee."}
{"text":"This is a place to visit ONCE if you haven't been to a Nespresso before. Grand decor, even grandeur (read expensive) coffee makers at the back of store. Coffee is very average, some are rather tasteless. But what bothers me MOST is the service--pompous service!!! I have been there twice. The first time I came across a rude staff and though it was my bad luck and wrote it off. The second time I am almost convinced that it's the culture in the store. The body language when they are serving you. My goodness! These people think because they work at Yorkville give them to behave that way!!! I almost wanted to go all American and yelled at her at her face!"}
{"text":"Come here if you wanna be bougie and aren't bothered by spending extra $$.  The interior is posh-looking, with comfy tables on the first floor and a Nespresso store on the upper level. The staff were all friendly and attentive to the customers, not your average coffee shop experience.  They have a wide selection of coffees, espressos and lattes and a pretty impressive food menu. I didn't try the meals but had two different pastries (salted caramel and raspberry chocolate) which were served warm and were delicious.  Yes, it was a little more expensive but it was definitely worth it. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Love coming here for coffee... such a great location!"}
{"text":"Great service upstairs with the pods and machines. They were very interested in helping us get the best deal.   I've had an awesome salad in the cafe (the beet with goat cheese), though the almond milk lattes have been very bitter."}
{"text":"It was a beautiful boutique/Cafe--I was waiting for a friend and needed to buy some Pods so I stepped in and looked at the availability of espressos and pods, made my purchase with an English lady who appeared to be uptight but she was very very helpful!  She helped me trying out the new Brazilian blend and in my purchase.    After making a purchase I decided to try out their chocolate flourless torte while waiting for my friend.  Service was impeccable!  My friend when he came got a latte and it was a very pretty picture perfect looking latte--quite impressed.    It was a bit 'pretentious', if you will, but the space is lovely.  On the pricier side of things and nicer than a Starbucks but still, service was wowza!"}
{"text":"Fanciest Nespresso boutique I've been to! There's a cafe downstairs and a patio outside where people are sipping away and enjoying their drink and treats. Rue Crescent is a good place to people watch as it's full of bars and restaurants so there's always people in this area.  The second level is the actual retail store where you can buy all your pods at the counter. Service is always exceptional and friendly. yeah, it is suprisingly friendly at the nespresso boutique even though it can come up a bit snooty. Always great to stock up on pods if you don't have one in your city and save on the delivery fee. They always offer a free espresso and it's a great way to try a set of flavours."}
{"text":"Everyone is complaining that this place is pretentious...well that just happens to be one of the reasons why I come here!  I love the lay out of the store, it's always clean and they let you sample whatever flavours you want downstairs before you buy. The queue is crazy on the weekend so come on a week night if you can to avoid the mayhem. You can bring the capsules back for recycling and they keep all of your info on file so there is no need to remember anything, which is perfect for me.  Nespresso has made me a nicer person in the morning so I for one love this store and their product."}
{"text":"Oh my god! Loved this place. I drink Nespresso at home and had never come across the bar. Good food to go with world-class coffee, very good service, fantastic space and a Nespresso store in the back to take pods home. Wish I could go here every day!"}
{"text":"Rating: 4/5 Food/ Drinks: 4/5 Service: 4/5  Very well designed and aesthetic coffee shop that fulfills your inner craving of coffee while providing you with an elegant and peaceful environment. A lot of coffee shops I have visited are too busy or too crowded, but Nespresso seems to have allocated enough space so that you aren't elbow to elbow with someone else sipping on a coffee. Instead, you can sip your coffee or latte in peace while chatting with others comfortably and admire the architecture of the 2-story building! Tips: look up, its beautiful.  Food/ Drinks: I got the Dulche de Leche coffee - it was blissful and smooth. A little too sweet as it was more difficult to make out the coffee flavors, but it was overall very enjoyable. I also indulged in a salted caramel macaron which was made well but seemed did not seem as fresh. I believe they have macarons frozen and taken out, so the quality isn't as up to par with upscale bakeries.  Service: Their service was very smooth - they seated us and were very accommodating with checking up and help with them menu. Even for Nespresso, they realized that the coffee shop isn't a place to upfront sell their products so they didn't try to bother us about buying their coffee beans or other products which is appreciated. Overall very friendly, but nothing to rave about from any other coffee shop."}
{"text":"One of my favorite cafes and boutique. I have been a loyal Nespresso customer for over 5 years. I was introduced to this brand back in Barcelona in 2009. I waited a few years for this place to open here in Montreal.   The service is impeccable, the product is amazing. I give both the boutique and cafe two thumbs up. Love the ambiance and simply never disappointed.   For all the coffee lovers out there, you won't regret owning a machine or stopping by the cafe for a great drink. Oh yeah, their macarons always hit the spot. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My review is less about the actual Nespresso bar than the company itself.  I have been drinking Nespresso since 2006, I was on a trip to Paris and the apartement we rented had one, the rest as they say is history.  Now a little about the product, the machines have been hit or miss over the years, (we have purchased mutiple ones to have in different homes 4 in total) D290 is the best one, the others have all broken down at one point or had issues.  I must say that the service in getting these machines replaced has been very efficient and quick.   The delivery services work very well also, my mom lives in a little remote place outside of Quebec (it is so remote they actually do not have an internet provider yet!!!)!, and she can order her nespresso pods online and have they are delivered with 48 hrs, so pretty good.  For those of you who travel, I have found that the cheapest place to buy the pods is NY city, I save about 10 Cents per coffee, so it is worth loading up when your there.  I figure that it is not cheap but for someone like mtself that has a once a day coffee habit it is worthwhile, the fact that I have not seen a coffee bean or grind laying around, and that fact that it is the perfcet coffee with crema each time is what makes me a huge fan.  Valerie  As for the stores employees, I must say I find them all kinda full of hot air, and I can see why people think they are snobbish, but I think that is the image Nespresso wants.  For my part they are always easy to deal with because all I ever  say is gimme 10 sleeves of black,  10yello,10 kaki.....blablabla."}
