{"text":"Good food. Poor service. Server would only give one extra napkin when he was asked for extra napkins. In addition, it was hard to enjoy the meal because there were so many gnats flying around."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in parma! We always get take out from here. Great egg rolls, orange chicken, sesame chicken and egg foo young are some of my favorites. Outstanding service and very nice lady's working the phones and desk."}
{"text":"Sichuan chicken over rice is yummy.portion is huge good for 2 people.service is very good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese restaurants! The Pad Thai is delicious! Food is always made perfectly."}
{"text":"After moving into the area I tried several terrible Chinese food places before I found this one. From the outside I wasn't really sure what to expect but I'm glad I took the dive. I've never had anything bad from Jackie Chen's (in all fairness I tend to stick to the same things). I've recommended this place to several people and they have all enjoyed their food. I've always taken food to go so I'm not sure what their sit-in experience is like. When I order to go my food is always ready quickly and hot and tasty when I get it home.  The best Chinese in the Parma/Old Brooklyn border area."}
{"text":"The best Chinese in Parma. Well-priced. I do wish they served pints/quarts but it's cheap enough so fine. Food is always ready on time and much more flavorful than the other Chinese places up the street. Nice that there's a dine-in too."}
{"text":"Jackie Chen's serves good honest Chinese food for the American palate. It wasn't high end; the decor was so-so but it's a step up from a take-out place. For a quick lunch I don't mind stopping in but it's not the sort of place I would take a date or decide to go after thinking \"Where should we go for lunch\". It was good enough to go back, though."}
{"text":"Generals chens chicken was amazing, crispy and delicious, lomein was good, portions were huge we got 3 meals out of it, we ate there and we were the only ones, the guy behind the counter seemed surprised we wanted to stay and not take out but food was great"}
{"text":"The food is really good and the portions are large. It's probably the best Asian takeout in the area."}
{"text":"We ended up trying this out on Friday night.  We were slightly worried about the fact that we were the only ones there...but our worries slowly disappeared.  The whole time we ate, a slew of people came in and out for take out.

Overall, we really liked this place.  The food wasn't greasy and the portions were great for what you paid for.

We got chow mein, general chens chicken and monglian beef.  Everything was delicious.  We will definitely be going back on a more regular basis."}
{"text":"Huge portions!! Super yummy!! Hubby got General Chen's & I got Sesame Chicken... Both had white meat (not the yucky brown chewy meat others use!). The Crab w Cream Cheese Wontons were top notch too!! It's also nice that you can order online... No wondering if they got your order right or understand your specifications!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place the other day and like most Chinese restaurants, the portions were large and worth the price.

Their egg rolls - both meat and vegetarian were awesome.

Their duck sauce tasted a little bit like ketchup but I still ate it / still enjoyed it. 

The place is so cute on the outside and inside. The customer service was good - my boyfriend said they were very friendly. 

Large menu with a good variety of food.

This is going to be our Chinese restaurant from now on!"}
{"text":"A new gem in my arsenal! I love this place. If it weren't for my husband who works in Parma, I would never have stopped here, based on the street level appearance. The food is so good. Service is what you typically get at this kind of restaurant, not the best, but it is SO made up for with the food! I haven't had a bad meal here!!! Crab rangoon - yum! Egg Drop Soup - yum! Sesame Chicken - yum! Hawaiian Chicken - yum! I could go on forever :)"}
{"text":"Last 2 times I went here, it was good. This time, I made a large order and it was ready in 10 minutes. Last 2 times, I waited about 25-30 minutes for my food order, to go. The food today was OLLLLDDD like an old sack of balls, and dry. NASTYYYYYY. never ever going back."}
{"text":"Really good food! Glad we found it! Just wish they would sell al la cart for my friend. Also wish they served beer."}
{"text":"Super good Pad Thai. Gigantic portions. On the downside they use canned baby corn and water chestnuts and they don't rinse them before using so it ruins the entire dish if you order a dish with both of those included."}
{"text":"There's not to many places that are good but this one is pretty good best in in parma"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food around. sweet n sour chicken is excellent huge pieces of chicken. the won ton soup is the only one I'll eat. no icky after taste like all the fast food places have."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  My fianc√© introduced me to Jackie Chen's about 5 years ago and I've been hooked ever since. I've tried other Chinese restaurants and nothing compares. We recently moved and it takes us almost 20 minutes to get to Jackie Chen's but the drive is worth it!"}
{"text":"Tried them tonight, good quality and large portions. I like this place cause they don't use a ton of oil like allot of other places. I will be trying different thinks on the menu here shortly, I got the Mongolian beef this time. Yum"}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off for at least 10 years. Sure there's been a few misses but, it's a great spot. I miss the sushi tho.
Stopped in after a busy day as it's right off 176. They were backed up but, the lady at the counter was as friendly as could be despite the insanity that included multiple carry out orders, and 3 dine in tables. One, dumped a full plate of food on the floor and left it and a cluttered table behind. Zero attempt to clean it up themselves. At least scoop it off the floor ffs!!!
I hope they left a decent tip.
Anyways, I did wait a bit but, it's a Friday night, they were busy and BOY WAS IT WORTH IT!
It took me maybe 15 minutes to get home and it was still smoking hot!! Had to let it cool!!
Fresh crunchy veg and great flavor!!
A++++
Pics are of kung pao tofu !!"}
{"text":"We tried several dishes today.  Bourbon chicken is very good! General chens is awesome. The potstickers were good but dough was under cooked. Tried the Pad Thai but we did not care for it."}
{"text":"absolutly love this place!..I ave been to every chinese place around,and this one i would compare to dragon gate,king wah,pearl of the orient. That good! and its in parma!!!!..i order only from here now!"}
{"text":"Absolutely best food and value Chinese food in Cleveland.  Whole white meat \"general chen's chicken\" amazing sweet and sour chicken, generous portions and great customer service.  Well worth the drive to pickup rather than deliver!

5 stars for their amazing veggie fried rice! Unlike any other Chinese places in town."}
{"text":"I know good chinese food. This is good chinese good. Egg rolls above par, sweat and sour sauce is out of this world. Crab rangoons and egg rolls are best with it. General chens chicken is the greatest fast food chinese dish ever created. CRISPY white meat chicken smothered in sweat spicy sauce. Yes, even covered it that amazing goup, it's still super crispy. Simply put...amazing stuff!"}
{"text":"BEST CHINESE PLACE in CLE. Service is always phenomenal you can order online and have your food waiting for you if you would like to dine in on your lunch break, or carry out etc. The food is fresh, and taste of highest quality. Inexpensive for the amount of food you receive and the quality. Since I discovered this place a year ago, I do not go anywhere else. Highly recommend veggie fried rice - so fresh, vegetables are crunchy and great, and the chicken egg roll. Check it out. 5/5"}
{"text":"My favorite place to go for chinese. General chens chicken is by far the best but also love the sweet and sour chicken, war su gai chicken,  beef w broccoli and their chicken egg foo young is soooo good. Best pork fried rice in town. Nice portions. Love thid place"}
{"text":"While we were sitting and waiting for our order, a man in pajama pants came in and ordered something called a \"General Tso's Domination Platter\". My boyfriend insists that the man misspoke or I misheard, and there's no such thing. I want to believe that this is an actual menu item, and I fully intend on ordering it next time. 

This place is awesome! Everything I've ever had here has been delicious, but it had been a few years since my last visit. Jackie Chen's was one of the only places open on Christmas Day, so we decided to get takeout. Everything was super delicious and really inexpensive and fast!"}
{"text":"Best fried rice around!! Huge chunks of veggies in it and it is so delicious. Not your typical generic Chinese food. The ingredients are so fresh and I've never been disappointed. Plus a nice bonus is the takeout containers are great containers to save and reuse!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for dinner. Friendly staff, tasty food and nice customer service. We've ordered a few different items and they've all been fresh. We've dined in and ordered out."}
{"text":"Jackie Chen Asian Diner is the sister restaurant to Jackie Chen Dragon Towers in Kamm's Corner. This location is more of a faster s d casual dining experience. Still has delicious food, with a friendly staff."}
