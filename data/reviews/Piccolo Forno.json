{"text":"For my money - and you'll have to spend some - best in the city. House made pastas, scratch sauces, brick oven pizzas (creative ones too - pistachio pesto, romano cheese, basil, mortadella, burrata - wow).  I know people b*tch about about the waiting and limited reservations - ok, so if that's a problem, don't choose to go to one of the best restaurants in the city on a Friday or Saturday, prime time dinner rush. They are open 10am -- 11pm Tues- Thurs, too.  In terms of actual pasta and pizza - probably the best I've had. Stacks up with anything you'll find in the North End."}
{"text":"I love quality Italian food, especially homemade, flavorful pasta, and this place exceeds my expectations every time. You can always tell the quality of what you're eating when you take a bite of one of their dishes. For the fresh bread they serve upon arriving to the unique appetizers and craveable entrees, I try to come here as often as I can. BYOB is another great aspect of this restaurant. Their tiramisu is the best I've ever had in my life, definitely try it! They get quite busy on the weekends so arrive with time to wait."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant, terrible dining experience. I went to give a try after reading so many positive reviews. When I got in the lady at the reception sat me down really quickly (it was 4 pm so quite open). Then the waiter came and told me they are on a time constraint, okay, I'm fine with that too. To help quicken the process I ordered the soup straight away. Then this was where it went wrong: he rushed back and ask me what to order, after 2 minutes I sat down! I used another minute and ordered an appetizer and main course. Surprisingly,The main course came first! The food turned out to be fantastic so I let that go. Then the appetizer came, also pretty good. I went by myself so I got a small table, and having both appetizer and main dish on the same time barely left space for anything else. Then while I was working on my food, the waiter came to ask if I want anything else. I ordered a cappuccino, and specified \"after when I'm done\". And it came in 1 minute. Good job in getting things down, at the wrong time! Now with three items on the table and a plate and basket of bread (which, btw, is stone cold), the table got too bloody busy. Maybe he didn't hear me asking to serve the cappuccino at the end, but he would if he wasn't rushing! Any waiter who is not trying to push customer out of door should know to serve it last!  In a restaurant like this I expect to enjoy my food, and I can totally see how I should be able to do so under so much stupid pressure.  Oh by the way, I asked before I left, they didn't have a clear reason to be rushing. And it looked like I was the only one that was treated that way."}
{"text":"Very good classic Italian dishes with a few innovations thrown in. We particularly enjoyed the gnocchi, the lasagna (a bechamel/ragu combo that tastes a bit like Greek pastizio), the wild mushroom tagliatelle, and the spinach/carrot rolled thing with pesto sauce. The spinach/carrot was the highlight. The restaurant draws in a mixed crowd of older/younger diners and was a nice place to take my parents.  The only negatives were a seat in the back by the bathroom (completely negates a good ambience) and slightly unfriendly service. The polenta appetizer is also lackluster. This is a personal thing, but I was disappointed that the only dressing they had for salads is a basalmic vinaigrette. If, like me, you hate basalmic vinegar, there goes half the menu.   The pastas tasted fresh-made and all the sauces were good. The lasagna was huge--consider splitting.  On a Saturday night, we waited for about 50 minutes for a table (arrived at 7) so either go early on the weekend or plan to wait. They take your cell phone number so you don't have to hang around outside, which is great because there's a cafe down the block."}
{"text":"Lasagna tasted like chef boyardee, very unimpressed. On the other hand my wife said the cannaloni with chicken was awesome and our friends enjoyed the pizza. We will try it again."}
{"text":"Not impressed by this place at all and the wait was really long.  Service was average, decor/atmosphere was average, prices were ok, and the food was disappointing.  I ordered a lamb ragu pasta, but got something that tasted like chicken noodle soup.  Pizza was ok, but nothing memorable and definitely not worth the wait.  Only good thing was that it's BYOB."}
{"text":"One of the best place I have been in Pittsburgh. Small but was able to go to a bar across street while waiting for table. The food was amazing. I enjoyed every bite of my seafood salad to the amazing pizza."}
{"text":"Love this place! Every meal we have is delicious.... pizza, pasta and salads. The wait can be long because it's so good... we go around the corner to Grapperia and enjoy a drink while we wait."}
{"text":"The lasagna! Still thinking about this food 2 weeks later!!! Seriously delicious, excellent service, great ambience. I'm a lover of Italian food, but sometimes pasta dishes can get monotonous. Well this place has turned Italian good on its head and has some of the most creative and delectable dishes. We decided to get a couple pizzas and a few pasta dishes and do tapas style so we could all taste a variety. Get the lasagna- it was the best I've ever had and unlike any I've had. My table also loved the mint risotto special (I'm not a mint fan), and we also got the mushroom tagliatelle which was good. Honestly, anything you get here will be great but go for the lasagna as a must."}
{"text":"The person answering the phone was rude, unhelpful and arrogant.  I refused to proceed further after that experience.  Lots of great Italian places in the city...who needs an attitude.  Is it worth that plus the risk of no seating, no waiting area, no wine list.  I think not!!"}
{"text":"Truthfully I'm not a huge fan of Italian food so i came here kicking and screaming upon the request of a friend and was not at all disappointed. The service was great and the food beyond excellent. If you have any doubts get their lasagna which will certainly blow you away!"}
{"text":"Really disappointing. Don't understand what all the hype is? I went a second time because it's in my neighborhood and everyone deserves a second chance. I'll be nice and just say the food here is  pretty awful. They have a beautiful wood oven and no clue how to make a proper Neapolitan pizza. The pastas were over cooked, over sauced and the lasagna tasted like some pre-made frozen dinner. The service was rushed, borderline rude and impersonal both times."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The atmosphere in this place is pleasant and subtle; not too loud, not to bright, but just romantic in a way. I had gone here with my boyfriend and his family. There were 6 of us and although the place isn't very big itself, we still had tons of space at the table we were sitting at.   Piccolo Forno is a BYOB type of restaurant, and they offer to open it for you, which is very nice. They have plenty of options on their menu such as pastas, pizzas, anti-pastas, and paninis. All are reasonably priced. The service is great, the food is amazing, and I would definitely recommend coming here if you want great quality food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Plan to wait  at least an hour for a table on a weekend night.   No reservations.  Great service.   Great food.   Byob.  Great pizza."}
{"text":"AMAZING. Every time I've ever gone here, it's been fantastic. There's generally a wait in the evenings, but it's absolutely worth it. With the addition of the wine bar in the back, they have the whole package. Do yourself a favor and get their lasagna! My husband swears by their pizza.   We love the staff there. Always so friendly and helpful!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go, always great food, whether it's for a pizza or a dish of pasta. It is consistently good food and good service. I also like that it is a BYOB place and they have a parking lot."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best place to eat in Pittsburgh. My mom and I visited recently and loved it. Bring your own wine is a great idea and makes for a reasonably priced night out. The food isn't just your typical pizza and pasta, offering some new dishes I've never heard of. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe I am lucky enough to review this wonderful little restaurant first on Yelp!  I have known about this restaurant for many months, but just have never made it in...  until tonight!    Luckily, my friend and I decided to come here.  It was a Friday night and at 6:45 pm, there was already a line and a 30 min to 1 hour wait.  We headed over to the bar which was catty-corner and waited for them to ring and let us know our table was ready.  We were happy that the wait was closer to 30 min and soon, we were happily trying to decide what to order.  I should take this moment to mention that they are BYOB (I love BYOB).  $4 corkage per bottle for wine and $2 per beer.  We finally decided on the Bruschetta (5 large pieces of mixed standard, olive tapenade and roasted red peppers) to start with, a good choice although I heard the Melanzane is wonderful.  We both got the lasagna, which everyone raves about (deservedly so, as the pasta sheets are obviously freshly made and is just as good eaten cold as it was hot).  Happily, a salad came with the entree - yay!    I sadly did not try their dessert as I was to stuffed from the amount of food we had eaten.  All that above for approx $20 per person (tax and tip included) plus leftovers!  What a great deal!    BTW, the pizzas looked (and smelled) sooo delicious and were made right on the floor.  This is what I am trying next time.  If you are in the mood for Italian food and want delicious food coupled with great service, great prices, and a good ambiance, you definitely need to make it to this restaurant.  I am almost scared that my review will make it even harder for me to get a table next time! -------------------------------------------------- I've had the pizzas and dessert.  The pizzas are quite good (Il Pizzaiolo is still supreme though) but forget the desserts.  After 2 tries, I am totally happy to fill up on my entree and forgo the dessert.  Reservations for 5+ people!"}
{"text":"What a place! Located in trendy Lawrenceville, piccolo Forno had a cozy decor, although it was a bit loud. We showed up in t shirts, which probably wasn't a smart move.  Now, onto the food:  We started with the meatballs, which were a bit plain but were nonetheless tasty and served with a delicious pesto.  For the mains, we had the prosciutto pizzas, with mushrooms and arugula, respectively, and each were delicious and cooked to perfection. The best entree, in my opinion, was the boar pasta, which was flavored excellently. Long story short, I'll try my hardest to come back when I'm in Pittsburgh next."}
{"text":"Completely overrated food and atmosphere, but the tiramisu with lemon flavor was amazing!"}
{"text":"Food: Piccolo Forno offers traditional Italian dishes, but it also offers numerous unique takes on Italian cuisine that seem both authentic yet new.  You can order lasagna or also get pasta dishes like you've never seen.  Both dishes we ordered were unlike anything we had tried at other Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh.  There are plenty options for vegetarians but also meat and seafood.  The soup was delicious and came with a giant roll in it, soaking up the soup.  The rotating desert options are multiple variations on the same theme (a bombe), which is basically a hard chocolate covered ice cream/cake ball shaped contraption (awesome), but they also have gelato/tiramisu.  The portions are large (enough to take home), and we were beyond full with soup, dinner, and desert.  The pizza is rumored to be good, and looked/smelled good, but we didn't try it.  Price: The prices are surprisingly affordable, with no entree over $20.  Our entire check for two came in at under $55 (two soups, two entrees, one desert, two coffees), cheaper than some lower quality places in the city.  You get your money's worth in terms of food quality and quantity, no doubt.  Drinks: BYOB.  Tables around us were drinking everything from bottles of wine, to bottled beer, to cans of Busch.  One table even had an entire bottle of Jack Daniels on the table they were passing around.  Atmosphere: The seating is tight, with tables packed close together.  You have to tread carefully to get to the bathroom without tripping over another table or knocking someone's drink.  This also leads to a pretty loud dining experience, because the place is always packed.  The dining room is simply decorated and there's not an eye-sore to be found.  A bigger dining area would probably be an improvement (see below).    Service: They do not accept reservations for a table less than 5.  So for those with less than 5 in their party, you fight through the mass of people at the front door and get on the list.  There is always a list.  We were offered a 2+ hour wait for a table of four, two of our party backed out, and we still waited over 90 minutes for a table of two.  We have drove to Piccolo Forno in the past at least 3 times, learned of the wait time, and went somewhere else.  Your best bet is getting on the list, then going to a nearby bar for a few drinks.  But once you do get seated, the service is quick and friendly.  The menus, food, and drink refills come early and often, likely to get you out of your table and someone else in it.  (+): Unique, delicious, and affordable take on Italian food with good service, if you can get a table  (-): Thats a big \"if\", and booze and a bar would make the waiting less painful  Would I go back again? We'll at least try."}
{"text":"We had our (smallish) wedding in the upstairs party room. Nealey was amazing and really helpful as we planned the wedding. Our servers were rock-stars, the space was gorgeous, and the menu was delicious and huge. The owner's mother made our wedding cake. It was one of the best cakes we have ever had and it was giant. The servers handed out monster-sized pieces and everyone took some home too. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"In sum, for those that don't have the time to read the whole review. The pizza is superb- order anything else and it is hit or miss.   I struggled on how to rate this. I REALLY want to give this place 5 stars. When the cooks prepare the meals correctly the food is absolutely amazing. Heck, one is tempted to eat the plate when they are finished. However, this is not the case EVERY time one eats here. I've eaten here 5 times in the past 6 months.   The lack of consistency is truly a travesty. I suppose if I dine here again, I would only order pizza. Pizza is the only item that  one can reliably eat a delicious pie every time. However, most other dishes are left longing, longing for someone to take the time to consistently season and prepare them properly EVERY TIME the dish is prepared.  I know others are bothered by the noise, well, it is noisy. I cannot dispute that. I can't say that the noise level bothers me too much. A few others have commented that the service is so-so. I would agree. Like the non-pizza dishes the service is also hit or miss.   I hope the owners carefully read the criticisms I offer. I want to love your restaurant, but when I order a dish one week and its amazing and the next week it is terrible- how can I justify giving this restaurant a rave review or be willing to even return? There are too many solid restaurants in the Greater Pittsburgh area to roll the dice on restaurants that are unable to consistently preform well."}
{"text":"Wearisome waits, lingering lushes, surly service, hapless hostesses and mediocre meals. Bottom line, Piccolo forno has quickly gone from great to ghastly.   My parents used to enthusiastically shuttle me to this restaurant when I would come home for the holidays to try some of their signature pizzas and pasta dishes. I admit I would always crave the tuscan beans a little bit on the way in the door. Then something strange happened. My parents started to be reluctant when I would ask to go there, saying that the waitstaff treated them rudely and really spoiled the otherwise good food.   Fast forward to our last visit, (likely my 10th time and my parents' 30th) and my dad started grumbling about the \"joyless\" manager before going in (a rather sour bald man)--I knew there was going to be trouble. I usually chalk these things up to senior moments but my dad is a service connoisseur--and very sensitive to slights. After being told we would wait for 45 minutes (which, again, is pretty stunning for a place in Pittsburgh on a Wednesday night), we checked in at 30 and the hostess pointed our table and the party was paying, and said we should be seated shortly. After the table paid, while we were standing there, the group asked the restaurant to open another bottle of their BYOB wine while we waited like fools for 45 more minutes. I'm sorry, but it is not a good business strategy to be miserable to waiting customers and so obliging to customers lingering around over a second bottle of wine that you're not even making money off of that the waiting customers leave. You want to be a real Tuscan restaurant? Take reservations and plan out your evenings. You want to be a little piece of New York in Pittsburgh? Don't take reservations and tell the lingerers to move along. You want to be a Pittsburgh restaurant for a long time? Don't treat familiar faces with scorn and act as if there were no other options in town. What a shame how bad staff can ruin a great place."}
{"text":"We had a wedding reception at Piccolo Forno about a month ago. We could not have picked a better venue for our intimate reception. Nealey, the restaurant manager, helped us plan the event across 8 months. She is very helpful and flexible. On the day of the reception, she and Charlie made sure all of our guests felt comfortable. Everyone LOVED the food and raved about their curry flavored rabbit pasta and tiramisu. Great food & great service!"}
{"text":"Went here last Friday with a friend that was visiting from Florida. We were able to grab a table outside as soon as we got there and avoided the 30 minute wait. We had the polenta appetizer (tomato topping is especially good!) and shared a margherita pizza with sausage and the lasagna. Pizza was good, nothing fabulous though, but I would have preferred one of the specialty pizzas (my friend isn't very adventurous when it comes to her pizza toppings). Lasagna was also good, but perhaps a bit too heavy for a hot summer evening. Service was sloooowww. Overall experience was good. I would go again, but probably order some different things."}
{"text":"Pizza was great - myself and the other 3 diners all got pizza and loved them.  Appetizers were not memorable but the side salad was also great.  BYOB is a major perk but the wait (2 1/2 hours on a Saturday) can be a little trying... However we didn't have reservations, so I guess that's expected, and enjoyed some beer and chips at the cantina.  I still prefer Ill pizzaiolo in mt lebanon but this is a good second."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian meals for affordable prices.  True Italian fare like it is meant to be.  Try the Insalata di Finocchio with the shaved fennel, oranges and red onion -- so refreshing!   The Lasagna Toscana melts in your mouth -- nothing like the congealed ricotta and sauce lasagna most restaurants try to pass off.  My husband loves the braised rabbit.  Wish they had wine but it is worth remembering to bring your own bottle just to enjoy the fare.  This place gets crowded and doesn't take reservations so get there early!"}
{"text":"I finally made my long overdue first visit to Piccolo Forno last night. The place was surprisingly busy for a Tuesday, which boded well for the quality of the food but poorly for the prospect of ever dining there on a Friday or Saturday. Fortunately there were a couple of tables available and my companion and I were seated right away.  We started our meal with the speck and mascarpone pizza, which came highly recommended by our charming and attentive waitress. The pizza was by far the best I've had in Pittsburgh, which may seem like damning with faint praise given the lamentable quality of the pizza in this town, but this pie was truly excellent. The crust, a common failure point for most local pizzerias, was perfect: fresh and airy with just the right amount of char on the bottom. The sauce was flavorful and properly balanced with the creamy mascarpone and savory speck.   After we devoured the pizza we decided to try some pasta, opting for paccheri with tomato and ground boar ragu. The pasta was fresh and well made, but I found the ragu fairly pedestrian. Not a bad dish, but far from the standout that was the pizza.  For dessert we shared the tiramisu, which I'd read on Yelp was delicious and generously portioned. While I certainly cannot argue with the latter, I must disagree with the former. What little coffee and chocolate flavor the tiramisu had was overwhelmed by an excess of orange zest or perhaps liqueur.  All told, I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner at Piccolo Forno and look forward to trying more of their fantastic pizzas (though it will be hard to resist ordering the speck and mascarpone again). I'll also be sure to bring a bottle of wine to take advantage of their BYOB policy, another point in PF's favor."}
{"text":"great food, the butternut squash ravioli was excellent! It's BYOB which is great, but it's on the small side, so expect a long wait on peak hours"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, great price, good service.  Seems like it is an upscale flatbread pizza place because I had the wild boar pasta dish and my wife had the lasagne and neither was that great.  I guess we expected more but I would prefer a good old Italian style tried and true lasagne to one with a different type of meat--maybe the boar.  My dish tasted like pulled pork in noodles with hint of barbecue-not a good combination.  Menu did not have any decent pasta options other than pizza."}
{"text":"I dined with fellow Yelper Kimberly B a few weeks ago here.  As she noted, even though we arrived relatively late, there was still a wait, so we headed across the street to Franktuary to have a drink.  I didn't mind the wait so much with a beer in front of me, and the 20 mins or so went pretty quickly.    The pizza we ordered (4 cheese) was excellent, as was my main - Tortelli.  The meat inside was nicely seasoned and flavorful, and the pasta shell was perfectly done.  I love BYOB restaurants - especially when they have great food.  Nicely done Piccolo Forno!"}
{"text":"This is without a doubt my favorite restaurant in the city. The food is elevated and has some really well crafted flavors but the food and the restaurant/staff itself always feel like home.  I could eat here every night."}
{"text":"The best. Great food, great service, great atmosphere.   Anything you select wont disappoint !"}
{"text":"Different styles and flavors from Pizzaiolo, but a great rival. Will not be disappointed with any of the pasta or pizza selections. BYOB is also a plus."}
{"text":"Ugh.  No reservations and an hour wait at 7:30 on a Tuesday night??!!  Someone needs to inform management that this is not Mid-Town Manhattan."}
{"text":"Warning! This place is NOISY.   Even on a Wednesday night!  I mean \"Excuse Me.\" \"Huh?\" \"What?!\" \"I CAN'T HEAR YOU!\" \"Wait I thought you said COULD eat seafood!\" kinda loud.  The noise factor definitely put a end to most normal conversation.  Add to this the fact that we were seated directly behind  the hostess stand and practically in another table's lap.  I could have taken names for reservations as well read the texts on the the other table's Iphone!  Food was good-Marinated&Roasted Veggies which were good.  My date and I split the Quattro Stagioni.  Different toppings-artichokes, mushrooms, prosciutto and roasted red peppers-pleased different tastes.  I'm generally easy to please when it comes to pizza and I really enjoy wood-fired pies.  So I was happy with our pizza and meal in general. However, the noise and lack of room made the evening hard to enjoy.  Our server was good but when he got a larger party he disappeared.  Leaving us with  our teeny table too crowded with plates and our drink glasses empty.   Somewhat aggravating evening as far as trying to relax with good food.  Maybe give Piccolo another whirl.... ugh...note when searching the website you might need to hit the mute button!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food in Pittsburgh and personal favorite of mine. There's always a wait to get seated but plenty of local spots right around the corner to grab drinks. You can BYOB too. Strongly recommend the pizza and ravioli."}
{"text":"Not sure why people like this place, the food here tasted like gross canned food.Yuck. If u wanna serve me seafood pasta, please make sure that it does not stink. The spaghetti ordered by my husband seemed like Canned pasta sauce and boiled   Spaghetti. The quantity of food, my god! wow who eats that much food! It might be the worst Italian food I have ever had."}
{"text":"The location and seeing are great.  The food was all ok, but nothing spectacular.  It all looked great, but in the end it was a bit forgettable.  The polenta appetizer was disappointg.  The Lamb Ragu was ok, but nothing special.  The atmosphere almost pulled it up to four stars, but in the end, the food just doesn't justify it."}
{"text":"Dishonest hostess; terrible attitude.  Rule #1: customer is always right.  Something is off here. They create seating availability and duration out of thin air and won't take reservations for parties less than 5 or more we came to find out. Having disgruntled customers due to dishonesty isn't worth squeezing few more servings out per night. Very greedy and short sighted.  Wife was hungry and craving Italian. Doing the sensible thing on a Friday night, we called to see if they could seat two. The host says no problem, we can. Great, we walk there. We walk there and ask for indoor seating and are told 15-20 minute wait. Hmm bit disgruntled, but you said 10 minutes ago you could seat us. Oh these things happen, it's tough to tell when there will be seating. Lie #1.  No waiting area, we stand out on the stoop for 20 minutes. No call, nothing. I go in to make sure they haven't forgotten about us. Hostess says we got tables outside, give us some more time to clean it up. Thought we told you we would like indoor seating. Oh, the tables inside are chatty and difficult to tell when they'll leave. Lie #2.   Frustrated, I confront her about lying twice and that had she been honest my pregnant wife would be eating now instead of waiting on the stoop. Again, I get the same snarky attitude and run around. Having lived all over, you'd swear this is the only restaurant and only incompetent hostess in the country incapable of managing customers for a dinner.   Now desperate to eat a piece of bread or anything my wife agrees to outdoor seating. A kind waitress comes out and asks us how we are doing. Frustrated and on edge, hopefully the food will make us forget this. Instead of easing the tension, she decides to regurgitate the same defense as the hostess.   We order and wife eats a bread slice or two. Wife too hormonal and in tears, I throw a few bucks for the bread, and we go elsewhere. Fortunately, we were able to go elsewhere nearby and salvage the night.  The competency of the hostess should be reconsidered."}
{"text":"If you're going to go out to get wood fired pizza or handmade pasta in Pittsburgh, this is the place to go.  I'm going to tell you all a secret here - Piccolo Forno has a wood fired pizza oven that was built in Italy. It was shipped to the US and installed in this building with a small forklift by the owner of the previous restaraunt occupying this space. Here is another secret - All the pasta is made by hand. All of it. It is not bought down in the Strip district, or shipped from some warehouse somewhere. It is hand rolled, cranked and pinched just like your mom would make at home. If you're lucky enough to have a cool mom like that. ;)  The pizzas here are cooked in this amazing hardwood fired pizza oven, they are approx. 10\" which is the size of the plate they come on and they have a handful of options - Quattro formaggio (the four cheese pizza), Salsiccia cipolla (sausage and onion), Quatto Staggioni (four different toppings on 4 sections of the pizza), Proscuitto Funghi (Cured ham and seasoned mushroom) and the always classic Margherita pizza. There are also two versions of beautiful calzones avail served with sauce inside as well as on top. Occasionally there are specialty pizzas that pop up with toppings such as ramps, speck and duck if you can catch them. Traditionally, you are supposed to eat the pizzas with a knife and a fork, but hey this is Pittsburgh and we do what we want here, right?   The pastas change seasonally here. Sauces include a rabbit, wild boar, and a hearty Bolognese. Trust me, this stuff is amazing. You'll want to wish you could buy quarts of the stuff to take home.   The tiramisu is made onsite and is a real treat. There are awesome gellatos avail as well.   Piccolo Forno is a byob restaurant, so grab a bottle of wine or a few beers before you head over. They do get busy during typical weekend times (Fri and Sat nights), but they take reservations. Although they have space I would caution against parties of 8 or more since it's a small cozy place. The servers and FOH staff are really great and easy going, even when it's busy. If you get a seat in just the right spot, you can watch the pizzas and the fire inside the oven.   It's-a good!"}
{"text":"Large portions and great limoncello for dessert!"}
{"text":"piccolo Forno is an Tuscan style-Italian restaurant on Butler Street in Lawrenceville which is only minutes from the Strip District and downtown Pittsburgh.  In the last few years, Lawrenceville has steadily worked on dusting itself off and dragging itself up from the tired run down town it was in years past.  There are now shops, cafes and restaurants and they are starting to outnumber the empty buildings.  I chose this restaurant on a blind whim from a list of restaurants and I was well rewarded for it. piccolo Forno,which means 'Small Oven,' is small and intimate but a large corner is devoted to it's namesake.  The piccolo forno is tucked in the back right corner where it's plied by chefs wielding long handled wooden peels to whisk pizzas in and out of the oven.  The walls are exposed brick with a golden yellow back wall that matches the wooden chairs snugged cosily around the tables.  When the tables are full it can get a little loud but the blended voices of other diners actually helps to create a sense of privacy around one's table.  It's common in restaurants around here to be provided with a basket of bread before the meal comes but not in piccolo Forno.  Here, they ask if you would like bread with your dinner and if you are amenable it is brought out only a minute before the entrees arrive.  It's possible that some would be put off by this as it's not the expected thing but it is very nice not to fill up on bread beforehand.  piccolo Forno has many things on the menu to choose from: salads, panini, pizzas and pastas.  Rick had the Tagliatelle con Sugo di Funghi  (Tagliatelle Pasta with a Mushroom Sauce).  I only had one bite of his but it was creamy with the earthy taste of mushrooms almost! but not quite overwhelming the pasta.  I chose to try something entirely new to me and even Rick was surprised and questioned my choice: Stracotto di Cinghiale con Fettucine--Braised boar with vegetables and fettucine pasta.  Many of the Italian cookbooks I've read usually have one or more recipes with wild boar and I've been curious ever since.  The meat was tender and the flavorful sauce coated the fettucine and vegetables with a slightly sweet taste that I couldn't identify.  If I can find some where to obtain wild boar for cooking at home I will have to go looking for a recipe and perhaps then I will find out what the seasonings were.  I visited piccolo Forno a second time to try a few other things off their menu.  Polpete Toscane were small beef & pork meatballs in a green sauce that unfortunately left a little to be desired.  The sauce was bold and flavorful but yet not enough to cover the blandness of the polpete.  Salt and pepper improved them enough to finish but not enough to order again.  piccolo Forno offers thirteen types of pizza on its menu and of course has the option to customize your own.  The Prosciutto e Rucola features crushed tomatoes and mozzarella and when it comes out of the oven it is topped with prosciutto and arugula.  The arugula is plentiful and a lot of time is devoted to piling it back on the pizza as some spills off with every bite you take but the peppery taste it adds to the pizza is worth the 'rebuilding.'  The outside edges of the crust were crisp with a chewy center but the inside of the pizza lacked a bit of firmness and would have benefitted from a few more moments in the oven.   Those who are familiar with New York style pizza would simply flip up the nose of the pizza and carry on.  This restaurant is not your typical Italian-American fare and should you walk in with that expectation you will find yourself disappointed.   The waiters are sometimes slow to attend one's table but a notable element of Italian dining is a delicious meal slowly enjoyed with friends and family.  I say take a deep breath, lean back and enjoy."}
{"text":"PF is a unique, tasty boutique for italian food in a city full of italian restaurants. I have been here several times and each time had a fabulous meal. I have ordered several different pizzas from the menu and they are incredible! The ingredients are fresh and the cut is extra thin (which I love). I am also a huge fan of their bruschetta appetizer. I asked them to substitute the last time that I went to switch the two roasted red pepper pieces for extra olive tapenade and they obliged with no issue. I haven't tried too many of the pastas, but they look fantastic when they come out.   As far as complaints go, the one thing that bothers me is that the staff at the front always makes me feel uncomfortable. There is a bit of an air about them, but that seems fairly common for the Lawrenceville area. The tables are pretty close together, but the decor is warm. Overall a great choice for a night out, especially since its BYOB!"}
{"text":"I don't like pizza and pasta. I was worried that when I would go to Italy, I wouldn't have food to eat. Then someone reassured me that as long as I liked PF's pizza, I was good. And I LOVE their pizza. Their bianca is my fave - with proscuitto, olives, artichokes, gorgonzola and mushrooms. It has thin crust, no pizza grease and lots and lots of flavor. Really as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"For a quick trip down memory lane, this is the FIRST restaurant that my fiance and I ever went to in Pittsburgh, this was about two months ago.  We had driven 2,600 miles across the country and wanted wood fired pizza, so a bit of Yelp research landed us here.    We have been back a couple of times since our first visit.  Honestly, I really like, (bordering love) this restaurant, it is BYOB so be forewarned.  The vibe is always bright and cheery, and the atmosphere is popping, always busy and fun to people-watch.    I LOVE the Speck pizza, the mascarpone cheese does it to me every time.  The last time we went we also tried a mushroom pasta, and honestly it was just kind-of meh.  The mushrooms tasted like they were canned, and the flavor was kinda bland.  The salads are HUGE though, definitely enough for 2-4 people, and our was really fresh and delicious.  Also, because we rarely make a reservation on a Friday or Saturday night, typically the wait is between 1-1.5 hours.  Don't be discouraged, there is an awesome little bar right across the street that you can wait at until you are called on your phone.  Pretty nice, huh?"}
{"text":"Amazing food, if you can get a seat.  And if you can't get a seat, don't complain.  Not being able to get a table because the food is so good isn't the best reason to give a great restaurant one star.  I waited for two and half hours IN WINTER - though mostly a block down in Espresso A Mano - to get a table. And it was worth it.    Service was on point and even though we were near the door, the place was so warm from the wood burning oven and being packed with people, we were never cold.  It's BYOB, so pick something up at the wine shop a few blocks away near the intersection of Butler and Main.  I had the Rabbit with winter vegetables over parpadelle, it was fantastic.  The fresh pasta was cooked just right so that it wasn't eaten away by the moist rabbit and vegetables.  My girlfriend had the risotto, it was good, maybe too large a portion though I'm not sure that's a bad thing."}
{"text":"LOVE Piccolo forno, even with the wait.  I usually don't go to places that don't take reservations (although they do for larger parties), this place is worth the wait.  The service is friendly, even when the place is crazy busy.  The best wood-fired pizza!  Just a great neighborhood place to go any time and get delicious, reasonably priced food.  BYOB is a bonus!  Could use a little more sound-absorbing decor..."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food, very reasonably priced, warm and cozy atmosphere. Had the baked eggplant appetizer and shared it with my husband. Cooked perfectly, wish I could have eaten the whole thing myself! Then my fennel salad came--it was wonderfully refreshing, only with the vinaigrette was a little more zingy! My husband had the house salad which looked fresh and delicious. I wanted to order all the salads--they were so unique. I ordered the tuna/caper pizza for my entree, it was excellent--the right balance of flavors! My husband was not a huge fan of the braised boar pasta, mostly because it had allspice or cinnamon in it, but he at in anyway. Our dessert of peanut butter chocolate something or other was great, as well. We will definitely be back again!    We had ressies (6 of us), they took us right on time."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Extremely fresh. Nice staff, intimate setting. Anything on the menu is good."}
{"text":"Ambiance: This place was extremely loud and crowded, my party of 6 was cramped into 2 tiny tables, but I could not hear the person across from me without yelling. Plates were constantly crashing into the floor.  Service: We had 2 waitresses, but somehow still managed constant empty water glasses, didn't get our bread basket until we requested it (even though every other table had it) and the front service was also rather rude.  Food: The appetizers themselves took almost half an hours to arrive. Taste was okay, polenta was bland. Bruschetta was nothing special. The pastas were the REAL disappointment. The mushroom ragu tagliatelle and lasagna was way overdone. I was looking forward to the 'house-made pasta' but it was just soggy and limpy. There was very little flavor in the mushroom ragu. The maccheroni was cooked okay but again, taste was very bland. The Cavatelli with the sausage and spinach was the only thing that tasted good, but my friend who ordered it came away with a terrible stomachache the next day. The pizza was nothing special either. ONLY good thing was the serving size. They were HUGE. But since everything tasted so terrible it was more of a hassle to try to finish it off when I got home. (I split it into 2 meals). The dessert tastes good, but is overpriced, and what can go wrong with gelato?  I'm open to all kinds of food but this was just not good food. I certainly do not understand why it was so busy. We had been so excited and made a reservation quite in advance due to the fact that our friend who tried to go before without one was told there would be a 3 hour wait. Avoid this place if you're looking for hearty italian!"}
{"text":"Piccolo Forno is a great Italian place...and I'm not a huge fan of italian food.  it still won me over, with a great atmosphere, good foods, and my favorite: BYOB!  The food here has a lot of classic stuff, the usual pizzas and pastas, but there are some real winners:  The rabbit and pork pasta dish is awesome, and pizzas here do deliver for their increased cost.    Service here is good one you sit, but don't expect to walk right in and get a table...it's no secret this place is good, and you'll wait for it.  I've waited as much as an hour and a half."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night and loved everything about this place. The atmosphere was fantastic and I loved that it was BYOB. The corkage fee was very reasonable and the service was excellent. Will definitely be back in the future."}
{"text":"If you have a child that likes pizza or pasta, bring them here bc they will like it.  Service during peak hours is unacceptable.  Pizza is customizable and there is no alcohol."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Overall on the small side, with a few outdoor tables on the front sidewalk and seating for about 30 inside.  There is a open cooking area with a wood-fired pizza oven in the back though I believe the main kitchen is in the basement.  The seating area is modern and a nice balance of casual but classy.  Drinks: BYOB! Yay!!!  Food: I love the food here.  They have a plethora of fresh, seasonally inspired ,pasta dishes.  I have tried several, usually an option with seafood, and have never been disappointed.  Also, their pizzas are amazing.  I have usually gone with one of the prosciutto pizzas put also recently enjoyed the pistachio and mortadella pizza.  Service: During each visit we have always had attentive, knowledgeable service.  Overall: Piccolo Forno is my favorite Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh as it offers a wonderful combination of great ambiance, delicious food, good service, and reasonable prices.  Tip: I like stopping by Arsenal Cider right up the hill on 39th street to get a growler of cider to bring to dinner.  Also, they typically have a long wait on Friday or Saturday nights so be sure to have someone put your name in early or be prepared for a wait.  Fortunately there are several good bars to sit at nearby including Piccolo Forno's new offering \"Grapperia\" located right around the side on 38th street."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I expected better. I went out of my way to eat here during a trip to Pittsburgh in May. Not sure what all of the fuss is about. Salad was soaked in dressing and the pizza was mediocre. I wouldn't come back here. I've had better frozen pizza from Trader Joes."}
{"text":"Piccolo forno is, hands down, the best value for food in the city that I have come across. I've been half a dozen or more times since I moved to Pitt and Piccolo Forno has never disappointed me. If you've never been before, at least one person at your party should order the marscapone y speck pizza to share with the group. It is simply delightful.  Portions are extremely reasonable- I'm a normal sized, younger man and I'll eat 6/8 slices at dinner and not leave hungry. Prices feel extremely low (13-15) for a pizza of such insanely high quality. BYOB makes this place the highest value restaurant I can think of.   The only downside of the restaurant is that they do not take reservations. They will, however, call you so what I've always done- either in a group of 2, 3, 4, or 6, is to place the reservation and head across the street to round corner cantina to enjoy a drink while we wait. I recommend you do the same as the wait will often be 30-50 minutes if you arrive during prime time."}
{"text":"There is a difference between an authentic Italian restaurant and an Italian-American restaurant. This is the former. It is one of the best examples of a restaurant as you would find one in Italy. The wood-fired pizzas are excellent. The atmosphere is quaint and casual."}
{"text":"Really a 3.5 stars but since this is the first place I went on a date 4 years ago with my new wife I'll be nice. This is BYOB so bring lots of wine/beer. The servers are friendly, the hostesses are not.....maybe Bc too many people come and dump their names and expect to be seated soon, but they could be a little more respectful. Went for a birthday party with 7 people so we ordered quite a bit off the menu. The antipasto plate was solid except they could have included some better cheese. At the boar pasta w a ragu sauce which was pretty hearty meal except a little bland. Had to use some ground red pepper flakes and salt to get some better flavor. Also I had a couple of slices of the mortadella pistachio pizza which was hands down the BEST part of the meal, absolutely delicious and a must try. For dessert we split all options, but the cappuccino Tartufo was the best. Overall another solid experience. Their pasta dishes could be more flavorful in terms of spice but they make up for it with their pizzas."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Lawrenceville and one the best Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh. I've been here many times and it never disappoints. This is one of the places that jump started Lawrenceville's renaissance. A gem."}
{"text":"Lunch was a plate of artisanal cheeses and cured meats, a salad of roasted cherry tomatoes and the sweetest, freshest mozzarella, and a margherita pizza. The pizza itself was a revelation. With Piccolo Forno's pizza, the crust is no longer a delivery system, but is so thin and flavorful it is actually a significant part of the pleasure of the meal. And the toppings are so fresh and first-rate. Nice service and very reasonable. And where else in the US can you have pizza this good and walk down the street to have espresso as good as they make at espresso a mano? A small slice of Italy in Lawrenceville!"}
{"text":"The pizza is to die for! Worth the long wait on the weekend."}
{"text":"A tasty Lawrenceville bistro indeed.  We have visited the restaurant twice and not been let down by the menu.  The pizza was done well, though the sauce was a bit on the sweet side for my taste.  My husband had a very inventive and tasty vegetarian crepes dish that was pure mouth-watering.  The squid ink Spaghetti neri is pretty good--fresh and well seasoned.  Our service was impeccable.  I didn't much care for the atmosphere, though both times we've been stuck in the back portion of the restaurant, which made me feel as though I was at some Panera somewhere...when I am paying $20 a plate + drinks and appitizers, I do expect a bit more ambience than that."}
{"text":"Being fairly new to the area, this was one of the first restaurants recommended to us. We arrived early on a Saturday evening and did not wait to be seated. What ensued was a FANTASTIC dining experience that we're still talking about over a month later. We started out with the Crostini di Polenta-absolutely delicious, especially with the grape tomatoes. I had the Focaccina Cruda-the ingredients were so fresh, they tasted like they had just been picked! My fiance had the highly Yelp-reviewed Lasagna Toscana-PHENOMENAL! It was quite literally the best lasagna either of us had ever tasted. We indulged in the tiramisu-it was a unique twist (I think they put in some type of lemon oil or mint?)-delicious. Paired with our favorite Keuka Springs' Gewurztraminer, this is the best Italian restaurant we have experienced in Pittsburgh. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"WOW!!! This place Rocks!!! The food, the atmosphere, the service, all GREAT!! They have terrific Pizza too!  BRAVO!!"}
{"text":"MMM...This was a great experience for my friends and I. Everything was spot on, the entire experience. On a side note if you do make a reservation, which we did, They are very forward about letting you know that they will not seat you until your entire party has arrived, and there is a time you are expected to be completed with your meal. I can appreciate the fact that this is the way they run their establishment. When our entire party of 8 arrived we were seated promptly.   Shortly the server arrived and greeted us and offered to open our bottles of wine. As well as informing us of all the specials for dinner. I ordered an appetizer of Torre di mellanzan, which is a small but delicious eggplant appetizer and the night special butternut squash and apple risotto. The risotto was cooked perfectly and was very flavorful.   One thing I would really like to emphasis was how awesome the waiter and service overall, we had was. I have had some really weird experiences with service lately. The waiter was friendly and everything came out together piping hot and for there being 8 people in our party I see that as a heck of an accomplishment. The dining room did not have an empty table and this dude knew how to make the guests happy. Since our party was large they automatically added an %18 gratuity. I still added an addition $5 on to that because I thought the service was exceptional.  BYOB is also awesome with only a $5 fee per bottle. This place was also very appropriately priced I was shocked that the bill with the included gratuity averaged around $52 per couple.  Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Having been a 3 year Pittsburgher, I cannot remember a time I left Piccolo Forno without a smiling face. Yes, it is not the best place if you have a problem with waiting outside and yes, it is not ideal for groups more than 4.  However, the food inside is very well prepared and you always get what you pay for.  The prosciutto+arugula pizza and the melanzane al forno are my personal favorites.  The bruschettas are always fresh and the insalate rucola just has the perfect balance of bitterness, crunchiness and acidity.  Hands down It is the best BYOB in Pittsburgh.   I always trust Piccolo Forno with my guests and hey, my girlfriend loves it too!"}
{"text":"this place has some amazing pizza, doesnt get any more authentic than this place!!! go check it out!!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in all of Pittsburgh. The margarite and picante are the two best flavors"}
{"text":"Piccolo Forno has some of the best Italian food in the city of Pittsburgh.  My husband and I have frequented PF many times, and have introduced many of our friends to this fabulous restaurant as well.  Every time that we have visited PF, be it for lunch or for dinner, we have had nothing short of outstanding service from the hostess to the servers.  The restaurant owner has even been on site several times, and is always very friendly.  Their appetizers and salads are big enough to share with another person.  Their wood fired pizzas are delicious.  If you're looking for just a pepperoni pizza though, these pizzas might not be for you.  My favorite is the Speck & Marscarpone.  Their pastas are delicious as well and are homemade.  Piccolo Forno is a great BYOB place that everyone in the city of Pittsburgh should check out at least once!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic but unfortunately the service was disappointing. Waited 15 minutes for water. Never received cheese or pepper on top of my pasta after I was offered some. I had very high hopes for the restaurant and left a little let down."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and have enjoyed the variety of offerings, the seasonal menu changes and even in-house gelato creations.  We always do family style and have a great variety of dishes each time.  We have frequently introduced new people to the experience here."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I typically order the same thing over and over at restaurants, but at PF, I ALWAYS want to try something new.   Their pizzas are amazing-- I highly recommend the mortadello e pistachio. It's the perfect blend of sweet and salty (I know that it sounds strange for a pizza, but trust me, it works).  For all of the times I have been there (at least a dozen) I have never had a bad experience with a server or wait time for food.   I also recommend going during off hours. They get packed for lunch/dinner and don't take reservations unless you have a larger party... Though, any amount of time is worth the wait for their food!"}
{"text":"Want to come back here to try the pizza, as their oven did not look like a joke. But I thought the pasta was ludicrously heavy-handed.  House made fresh pasta. Nearly impossible to go wrong when that's your starting point. It doesn't need all that much else. Decent olive oil, a fresh herb or two, non-Velveeta cheese....there's just no reason to go throwing the entire cabinet at it. It's hard to argue with a more focused approach, unless you are on a higher plane of cooking sentience (and if you are, by all means go nuts!)  The cavatelli was a red pepper bomb.......herb-blanketed anarchy. The canelloni was so creamy, so remorselessly decadent that I found myself craving some Olive Garden fettuccine alfredo to lighten the meal (that said, the very first bite was pretty god damned good). But if you brush all the stuff off from both dishes you're left with some nice fresh pasta, cooked well and showcasing impeccable texture. So for that reason alone this place doesn't fall into stay-far-away territory."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going here for 6 years and we love it each and every time. Consistently delicious Italian food! One of us always has to get a pizza, and the other pasta. The lasagna is definitely the best I've ever tasted. The prosciutto e rucola pizza and the tortellini are two other standbys for us. For starters, get the affetati (meat and cheese) or the fresh seafood salad. The best time to go is definitely for lunch or on a weeknight, unless you have some time to spare."}
{"text":"I first came to Piccolo because a girlfriend worked there, it soon became a favorite. Summer or winter, I love this place. I always pick at friends' plates and love what they get. But I cannot stop ordering the lasagna. It has this distinct cinnamon sort of flavor. I have had dates, girls' night, and my parents to this place and everyone has been a fan!"}
{"text":"A coworker and I went here for lunch when I was in down on business. the inside is small and can get quite packed.  We sat by the fire burning oven that they put their pizzas in so we knew this place was legit.  not a huge fan of their \"no substitutions\" rule, but I found tow items on the menu to try.  I tried their soup of the day which was like an Italian chicken noddle soup--ravioli instead of noodles and dark meat chicken in a broth with carrots and other veggies.  the ravioli was a little bland and the chicken was overcooked.  I also got the pear salad, which was delicious.  The ingredients were fresh and the pears were slightly cooked so they were soft and sweet as opposed to crunchy. my coworker got a pizza, which was generous in size.  It was some sort of veggie pizza.  I thought it was interesting that different parts of the pizza had different types of vegetables sliced on the large side (instead of lots of veggies finely chopped and spread out on the top of the pizza).  It made the presentation look awesome, but I'm not sure if I would have liked that taste wise.   Service was good but we also came when it wasn't too crowded so that was nice."}
{"text":"For the sake of ratings I gave Piccolo Forno a 4, but it's really a 3.5.   Piccolo Forno has a pretty decent little Margherita pizza made in a coal fired oven and their salads are big, beautiful, and tasty. I've not found better in Pittsburgh but I haven't finished searching yet."}
{"text":"The restaurant is small and clean and the servers are super friendly. They're usually slammed on the weekends, but our table of three managed to get a table within 40 minutes.  Our server was wonderful even while busy, our food came super fast, and it was EXCELLENT. The server Sofia was very knowledgeable about the menu and very attentive to our table.  Do yourself a favor and get the braised rabbit. It was excellent!   Plus we got the peanut butter gelato with a caramel center for dessert. It was heavenly."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!  We've never had a bad meal. Warm and cozy, great food, and friendly staff.  They really try and get to know and recognize you if you've dined there a few times.  Yummy wood fired pizzas, delicious pasta... and to top it off, BYOB."}
{"text":"Piccolo Forno has to be, hands down, one of my favorite Pittsburgh restaurants.    Before I get into the love-fest, I have to say the initial thing that annoys me: you can't make a reservation unless your party is of 5/6 or more, and you can't get a reservation for over 10.  That said, it's a small place and you can generally get a drink across the street at Round Corner Cantina or Franktuary (I'd go with the former).  But, onto PF.  It's byob. This is key.  The salads are very good and well-rounded.  I highly recommend the seafood salad or the insalata miste.  The appetizers are also very nicely done.  There are two types of bruschetta, one a tomato-based and one an olive tapenade.  I'm particular to the olive.  They usually have a decent meat and cheese plate as well, with excellent cured meats.    It's been a long time since I've had pasta there, because the wood-fire cooked pizzas are too difficult to pass up!  My favorite is the Pizze Cappriciosa, which has prosciutto, artichokes, olives, etc., and topped with fried egg.  The fried egg really makes the dish, which is an excellent blend of salty and savory, which balance out the natural acidity of the tomato sauce.  I'd even say the darned thing reheats really well, too!  Other great pizzas include the Funghi, Quattro Formaggi, and the Quattro Stagioni (four seasons), a past favorite of mine.  I've frequently had very good service here as well.  I would highly recommend this place to any Italian food lover!  I easily think it's one of the best \"Italian\" places in town."}
{"text":"This would have been a 5 star review if management seated incomplete parties when it is raining and the vestibule is at most 5' x 5' ... with customers leaving and coming.  Highly recommend reservations.  It is BYOB.  Most tables had bottles of wine.   I had heard prices were high.  I totally disagree. The prices reflect the variety of ingredients served not seen in other restaurants.   Read the menu online ... and google the ingredients that are unfamiliar.  We had the roasted beet and insalata mista salads.  Lots of spring greens and the balsmic dressing ... we were dipping our bread in the dressing.  The cheese platter was very good.  For dinner, we had spinach raviolis.  90% spinach with a thin noodle covering ... divine.  Three pizzas: 2 add your own ingredients and 1 from the menu.  The menu pizza had pesto, an unfamiliar cheese (recommended by our foodie waitress), mushrooms & gooey egg. I held the egg.  We all agreed our meals were excellent.  Tiramsu and gelato rounded out our meals.  We (5 of us) left satified not stuffed and suprised how reasonable our bills were.   We will definitely be back.  A ~10 car parking lot is next door ... plan for street parking."}
{"text":"Pretty good Italian food. We had the Lasagna Toscana and the Macchheroni something or other. The Lasagna was my favorite,  the Maccheroni wad a rigatoni dish covered in bechamel, and could definitely have used more veggies,  such as brocolli or asparagus.  I prefer lots of veggies with my pasta to offset the carbs, and for some reason,  they don't offer many veggies in any of their pastas. It was almost like you had to choose - pick protein,  or veggies,  but you can't have much of both. I found that strange.  Overall,  the quality was definitely there,  and I will go back to try the antipasti di mare and the tiramisu for sure. One of the better places in Pittsburgh that I have tried."}
{"text":"This was my go to pizza place in Pittsburgh. I usually order pizza to go from here because I live so close. The prosciutto e rucola pizza is delicious."}
{"text":"We had a nice lunch at Piccolo Forno on Saturday around 3:00 pm, which is a good time to go since the eatery is on the small side and fills quickly near dinnertime. After reading all the rave reviews about PF, I had it built up to gigantic proportions in my head and of course was a bit let down but mostly due to my own food choices. You see, I'm too Americanized in terms of my Italian food experiences, and Piccolo Forno is much closer to authentic Italian than I'm used to.  We were seated and ordered our drinks. They serve Coca-Cola products and I ordered iced tea, but it tasted like the tea container hadn't been cleaned well enough so the tea tasted a bit off...so I asked for water. Could just be a  fluke. We next ordered an appetizer and salad to share. We ordered POLPETE TOSCANE: baked meatballs of beef and pork with a fresh herb green sauce. These were unusual in that they were rolled in something like an herb. They are not like traditional meatballs. They were interesting to try, but we would not select them again. We next shared INSALATA MISTA: mixed greens with sliced radish, carrot, tomato, and cucumber, tossed in a balsamic vin, topped with shaved Parmigiano. This was good, but I felt the balsamic was too sweet. My husband really enjoyed the flavor.  For the main course my husband ordered SALSICCIA E CIPOLLE pizza: Crushed tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, sausage, onions and roasted fennel. The crust was super thin and crispy - really a treat. While he looks forward to trying the other pizzas, he said he would definitely order this one again and he thoroughly enjoyed it. I ordered the TAGLIATELLE CON SUGO DI FUNGHI: porcini and wild mushroom ragu on tomato tagliatelle with shaved truffled pecorino. This was not to my liking, but was a very high quality meal with handmade pasta. Could not ask for more, just wasn't the best dish for me, as it turns out. I think next time I'm going to stick with a delicious pizza cooked in their authentic Italian wood fired pizza oven.  For dessert my husband ordered the Bomba and I had the Limoncello Tartuffo. My husband enjoyed the light Bomba with caramel center, while I felt the limoncello gelato was too tart for my taste. Next time I'm looking forward to getting the Tiramisu.  The service was timely and pleasant and the restaurant had a fresh comfortable atmosphere. There are no steps to get into the restaurant but there are two steps to get to the farthest tables in the back or to visit the restrooms. There is a small iron handrail on the left side of these steps. There is on the street parking, but also a small lot across the side street that is shared with another business. If you go during the day, you very well could find parking in this lot for free!  This is a lovely authentic Italian restaurant with homemade pasta and delicious pizzas. When I find the best dishes to order for my taste buds, it will be a grand slam eatery for me, I'm certain."}
{"text":"I can't believe it's taken me this long to eat here, as Piccolo Forno has been a pretty popular place here for about a year and a half now.  Anyways, I finally made the trek out to Lawrenceville this past week.  Fortunately, I was able to walk right up at 6pm on a Friday and get seated immediately.  Couldn't believe it, as I've heard this place usually has a decent wait on the weekends.  I ordered the Quattro Stagioni pizza, which was cut into four separate sections topped with prosciutto, mushrooms, roasted red peppers, and artichokes.   The sauce was sweet, and there was just the right amount of cheese on it.  This isn't a take out style pizza where people seemingly always want more cheese.  I liked it a lot.    Also had the Spinach Canelloni with Gorgonzola Cream.  This was excellent.  Creamy, rich, and baked perfectly .    In all, I had a great first time eating here.  The food is very affordable and you can BYOB ($5 dollar per wine bottle).  A little lacking in atmosphere as the interior is pretty plain and the the restaurant is small, but it's tasty and familiar food.  I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Get the spinach ravioli but not when you're very hungry because it's not that much food. It is amazing however!! The butternut squash soup is also really good and every pizza I had was great. The pizza is similar to Mercurios in shadyside which is good."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to eat there for a few years, and I've tried at least 4 times... And every time I went I was told that there was a one or two hour line... Ahem, pizza's good but not that good, and anyway the kitchen closes at 11:00pm. The nice host was always appropriately saddened to give me the news.  But on Wednesday, at my 5th attempt, I got a table. So folks go there on wednesday.  We had two pizzas: 4 cheese and ham/mushrooms etc. The second pizza was very tasty, the 4 cheese one just good (one of the cheeses was a bit too sweet). Overall, it was a very enjoyable dinner. The tiramisu was excellent, surprisingly light.   The menu includes some antipasti (we did not try any but they looked good on our neighbors' tables) pizzas and pastas. Fairly simple menu. nothing fancy.  The waiter was also very nice this evening. And it's byob so it's appropriately nice with your wallet.   I am not sure I'll be back soon, but if I happen to crave for a pizza and if it's early in the week I'll eat there again."}
{"text":"Average.  Pizza ok, crust flimsy inside crust.  Pasta dish average.  BYOB is cool.  $5 corkage is reasonable.  Pricing in line with what you get.  Friendly service.  Not worth the wait on weekends. No reservations they told me but also noticed they were holding a table for a 3 - top while we were dining."}
{"text":"Boy is it hard to get a seat at this place.  On my first visit we went as early as possible on a Friday evening and waited about 1.5 hours. They only take reservations if you have a party of 5 or more. This time around we had a group of 8 but could only get reservations at 9 pm on a Friday. We knew ahead of time that you entire party needs to be present before they will seat you however the party ahead of us ran over and we weren't seated until about 9:20.  The food here is worth the wait. I recommend their pizzas. They are baked in the brick oven with fresh ingredients all at a reasonable price.  I ordered the bianco with fresh tomatoes and mozzarella-just scrumptious and large enough to take a piece or two home. It tasted just as fantastic the next day. Others in our party ordered the pasta fagioli was looked delicious.  I was a little disappointed that they were all out of their specials since it was so late but I guess that is to be expected. This place is BYOB and they do charge a corkage fee of $5 per wine bottle and $1 per beer. Our waitress was very friendly and did a great job with the large party of 8.  The inside has such a warm and cozy atmosphere, makes you feel like you are in your Italian Grandma's kitchen!"}
{"text":"Great pasta! Great portion size. The tagliatelle with orange zest was really nicely done."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed with my meals here, and had an exceptionally good meal last night.  The wait staff is always super, except the glass of ice with spoon I was given for my wine to chill it when I was looking for a chiller.  This was really funny actually.  As always the pizza was great and tried a new pasta dish, Cavatelli with sweet sausage broccoli rape and red peppers....I may never order a different pasta dish from here ever again it was that good.  This is probably the only place in Pittsburgh to get top of the line Italian food and walk out the door paying $35 for a dinner for two."}
{"text":"This food is great. I have to have a pizza every time I come here. They are packed with so much flavor. My wife loves the lasagna. I also like to try many of the pasta main courses and I've never had one I didn't like. The only downfall for the food is their processed meats are cured with sodium nitrate. Most processed meat is, but there are many better alternatives that a good restaurant can explore. Hopefully they can explore this option in the future. Even Trader Joes has a Prosciutto not cured with sodium nitrate. So it's possible.   The wait staff is really nice. The down fall is you can't make reservations for small groups. We usually have a 1 hour wait time for 2 people. There are a few bars near by to pass the time so I'll let this slide."}
{"text":"Pretty typical nuovo Italian restaurant.  I can always appreciate the brick oven and the salad was pretty good, but nothing else really stood out."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for some time. Unfortunately, I forgot it was BYOB and came unprepared.  My bad.  I was greeted by the hostess as soon as I walked in.  The atmosphere is lively, a little noisy due to the brick walls, etc, but overall I really liked it. in the back of the restaurant you can see the wood buring pizza oven.   I had the Soup of the day - Pasta Fagioli  - a vegetarian verion.  Very good and served hot.  I ordered the Proscuitto and Funghi Pizza with fresh mozzerella.  Delicious.  The service was very good, the server very pleasant.  I felt the food was quite athentic, having vacationed in Tuscany a few times - it really reminded me of that style of food.  I plan to return as there are several intersting dishes to try, including the home made fresh pasta dishes.  Next time I will remember to BYOB.  Try this place - you'll like it!"}
{"text":"In our nine years of eating out 2-3 times a week in Pittsburgh, my husband and I had our best meal so far last night at Piccolo Forno. We dined with another couple and all shared our meals with one another. It was so good, we couldn't identify a favorite.   Tender, flavorful braised rabbit, octopus so tender it bit like bread, pizza fired at 650 degrees with a perfect chewy crust.  The new bar addition a few doors down by the same owners has an interesting array of digestives and grappas. I told the bartender I liked specific flavors and he made me a custom, amazing after-dinner cocktail.  Made our night so special!"}
{"text":"Very popular and delicious Italian spot in the center of Lawrenceville. Semi formal, expect to wait for a seat. The best plate is the lasagna. Unfortunately it was sold out last time we went to eat it. Super bummed. The pizzas are very good. BYOB is convenient. Eat it."}
{"text":"First time here and we thought it was EXCELLENT!  You can't add or substitute...pasta comes as is and same with salad but we thought it was very tasty!!  Staff was very friendly and service was good also!  Menu changes often so if you like something the next time it may not be on the menu is disappointing but...that just means you have to try another delicious pasta dish!"}
{"text":"Piccolo Forno has truly wonderful food, most especially the handmade pastas! It's got a nice welcoming atmosphere to it and I've had excellent waitresses the two times I've gone. Disappointingly, I have had abysmally rude hostesses both times I went (different women) and begrudgingly put up with that for the fantastic pasta. Fortunately, my waitresses have been lovely and one of them even got our food to come out quickly because we were in a rush. This is a BYOB establishment, though I believe their corkage fee is $6 (I remember it was on the higher side). A huge drawback is that they do not take reservations for fewer than five people and don't even use the No Wait app, so you will inevitably find yourself waiting a long time if you come during peak dinner hours (no matter the day of the week). In a head-to-head, I would recommend Piccolo Forno over Senti, another Italian place a few blocks away, also with homemade pasta, because I have found their food to be better, so that's my recommendation if you are in the area and looking for great pasta! I will definitely be returning (though crossing my fingers the rude hostesses will be gone)!"}
{"text":"Rules I've discovered in life... when the pasta is made fresh and in-house, 9 times out of 10 you can expect an unforgettable meal. This rule definitely applied to Piccolo Forno!   Let's start with the service - hostesses were friendly and attentive. We had about a 20 minute wait and they advised us that Piccolo Forno also owned the bar Grapperia, which was about 30 steps away. We decided to walk over and grab a drink, but before we were able to place our order, the hostess called and said our table was ready (winner!).   Once seated, our server Charlie was AMAZING. Very friendly and passionate about the menu. Gave us some great recommendations and was extremely aware and cautious of my daughter's nut allergy when he was walking us through the menu.   I ordered the Spinach Ravioli with Sage Butter (so good), and we had the Crostini di Polenta, Quattro Formaggi pizza & Tagliatelle con Ragu di Agnello for the table. Everything was prepared perfectly and deliciously.   A lot of new places in Pittsburgh are taking a more daring approach with wild and exotic menu items, but Piccolo Forno uses quality ingredients to prepare simple and delicious homemade foods and you can't go wrong with that.   Pro tips: Don't forget your wine or prosecco! Since they are BYOB."}
{"text":"Piccolo Forno has interesting pizzas with a good crust, pastas with some creativity, and a nice atmosphere. Better Italian food can be found in Pittsburgh, but reasonably priced entrees, coupled with BYOB, makes for a nice meal with friends on a reasonable budget. An appetizer and entree will run about $20 per person. Make sure to reserve a few days in advance; it's often hard to get a table if you walk in or call the day of your meal.   If you are with a group, stragglers beware. They zealously enforce the \"all members of the party must be here\" policy on seating."}
{"text":"We were so lucky to come here during a time there was no wait, considering that seems to be the consensus of the reviews. If you know me, I'm constantly on the hunt for delicious wood fired pizza. Some friends told me their favorite pizza of all time was from Piccolo Forno so I had to see what it was all about. My husband and I ordered the Quattro Stagioni pizza, Pappardelle con Coniglio alla Garfagnana (braised spiced rabbit with pappardelle pasta), tiramisu and... Gosh for the life of me, I cannot remember the name of the dessert I ordered. It was a cappuccino gelato ball, really.   Anyway, the pizza had four toppings on four different areas of the pie, making it a nice sampling. The pizza was pretty good. Not too salty and pretty well balanced. My favorite topping was the prosciutto and my husband's favorite was the roasted red pepper. The mushrooms were my least favorite as they had a very strong smokey flavor, which I'm sure many might enjoy. Although the pizza was good, I liked the pasta more. All their pastas are made in-house which is really impressive. The braised rabbit and sauce of our pasta dish had a comforting, curry-like flavor which was perfect for a cold day.   Now. Onto the star of the show. The dessert!! My cappuccino gelato ball (I wish I could remember the name of this!) was AMAZING. As if plain gelato wasn't rich enough, the ball had a filling and was drizzled with caramel and chocolate syrup. I may come back just for this! The tiramisu was nice and light with an orange flavor. The entrees were good but the desserts were great!"}
{"text":"I came here for a yummy pasta lunch on a very cold day & doubt I will ever be back. A friend recommended this place and I didn't consult Yelp until I had already ordered.  Since I came at the end of the lunch hour there was no wait. The waitress was friendly enough and brought me water right away. I couldn't decide between the baked rigatoni with eggplant, the cannelloni with spinach and prosciutto or the mushroom tagliatelle so I asked the waitress to pick. She chose the baked rigatoni & I was excited to try it.  Big mistake. Yes, the portions are huge and sitting in front of me was huge bowl of gooey cheesiness that looked wonderful. The problem is that is had no taste. Really, there was no discernible flavor, only texture. I could not believe how something so cheesy & oozing with beschamel could offer nothing. There was also a massive shortage of eggplant, which I rooted around for and found very little of.  No matter how good everyone says their pizza may be, if you can't make a decent dish of pasta I'm not interested. With all of the Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh there ain't no way I'm coming back here."}
{"text":"The meatballs appetizer was trying too hard.. the meatballs had a nice texture but no flavor.. the pickled vegetables under them were lip-puckering they were so sour..  there were too many competing flavors with all that plus pesto   Mushroom pasta sauce badly needed salt noodles were a little too al dente.. pizza was alright.. wouldn't make a special trip to go there won't care if I ever go back!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food family has ever tasted....everything was wonderful, from  Lasagna and pizza to gelato....it was all wonderful"}
{"text":"We were in town for work and myself and 3 coworkers went here for lunch.  We arrived at about 12:10.  The restaurant was small and clean.  The server wasn't overly friendly but that was only the start of the problems. Two of us ordered the same thing, and the third and forth ordered different things.  The waitress returned to tell us that they were out of what the two of us ordered, and what else there were out of, which was about 6 other things. The sandwich I ordered came with a bean salad.  I passed on that.  My sandwich came cold and drowning in pesto.  She never returned to ask how things were so I didn't have the chance to send it back. When she came back to bring the checks we all had empty glasses.  At this point I let her know that it was cold. She didn't apologize or anything, just took my plate.  She ended up taking 20% off my check. Considering I ate half the sandwich and didn't get the bean salad, I figure she should have charged me only 20%."}
{"text":"I love Lawerenceville. Just saying.   Normally I have my BYOB radar on but I totally dropped the ball because I forgot to bring some vino.  We got a drink at Roundcorner instead when we were waiting for our table.  They called us when our table was ready which was nice of them so we could take our time at the bar  Huge windows, exposed bricks.  The place is definitely cozy. We got a table in the middle of things. Literally in the middle of the restaurant so there was a lot of hustle around us.   The menu is really pasta and pizza heavy which isn't normally my game.  I am more of a seafood kinda lady but I put my carb conscious mind to rest and ordered a pasta dish. The pasta was in a light red sauce with shrimp and capers.  It was definitely delicious.  I also started with a butternut squash soup with was rich but not too creamy. Yum.   I think the service was good but I honestly can't remember and I normally do. So I guess thats neither good or bad.   Pro: Cozy, BYOB, delicious pasta   Cons: I wish they expanded their menu to actual entrees  Overall: If I am craving some pasta I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"As a foodie, a two hour wait would turn me away, no ifs ands or buts about it! However the friends I was with said they were well prepared for this type of wait, since they have been here before. So we checked in our wine, since the restaurant is a BYOB, and headed to the Round Corner Cantina for some pre-dinner drinks. I have to say the bar across the street must make bank, since people seem to wait for this restaurant and directly head to the bar.  When our two hour wait, which I have to give it to the hosts, their quote time was pretty accurate, was over it was on for me to finally see and taste what my friends have been talking about.  Their interior design reminds me of a little Italian place, especially with the open wood fired oven. Ugh! it was beautiful, like Tuscan Italy beautiful. And the atmosphere to go with it, just flowed, the waitress was hip and knew her stuff.  Now I knew we were going in to have their pizza, but I did get a chance to look at their website prior to our arrival and noticed that they have salads, pastas, appetizers, and desserts that may be worth trying one day. Actually I'd love to head back to try it all, that's how I feel about this place. It's definitely a hole in the wall, hip spot for all ages. We ordered their bruschetta, which also offer's roasted pepper spread and olive tapenade. They were perfect, a perfect start to the pizza's we ordered. Quattro Formaggi, which is their white pizza topped with four cheese, ricotto cheese, gorgonzola, fresh mozzarella, and crotonese.  We actually ordered two of these, and yes you could individually taste each cheese, absolutely amazing especially being baked in their wood fired oven. Our other pizza, which was just as amazing, Salsiccia e Cipolle, crushed tomatoes, mozzarella, sausage, red onions and fennel. And didn't we devour them all. It was such a perfect night, each pizza you could taste each individual ingredient, and that's not a bad thing because they all balance each other out. Ugh I'm hungry thinking about it. I give this place a thumbs up all the way. I can't wait to head back and try many of their different menu options."}
{"text":"I rave about this place every opportunity I get.   The food is fantastic and more than reasonably priced.   My friends and I visit regularly and have only ever had one issue with the service. I haven't seen that server since then, so they must keep a good eye.   Desserts are usually either house made or flown in from Italy and delicious.   Easily one of my favorite places in the city."}
{"text":"Piccolo Forno is good.  The restaurant sits on the first floor of a handsome old building and the dining room is well-appointed and complimentary to exterior.  I received excellent service during my Tuesday evening dinner.  I also give Piccolo Forno a few extra points for being a BYOB (just be sure to plan ahead).  Piccolo Forno has a great menu, and I would like to try a few more of their dishes (the rabbit, in particular).  I ate a lot at Piccolo Forno: bruschette for the first course, linguine with mussels and shrimp for the main, ice cream for dessert, and coffee.  I appreciated the fresh pasta, the sauce was tasty, and mussels tender and flavorful.  The bruschette was a poor choice on my part -- the out of season tomatoes were watery and bitter, which, when simply seated atop toast, makes for a bland dish.  I enjoyed the dessert (Dream Bomba I believe it was called), but a few fresh, housemade dessert options would perfectly compliment a fresh pasta dinner.    All in all a solid restaurant that I would be comfortable recommending to friends."}
{"text":"Piccolo Forno is a lovely venue with great food. The atmosphere is warm and inviting. It would be an ultimate date night location if only the wait wasn't so long. I kid you not...nearly 2-hour wait. If you want good food, you have to be willing to work for it! If possible, try to make a reservation, but I think there's a group minimum.   The food though was great! There's something on the menu for everyone. For those seeking something simple and light, I recommend the Margherita Pizza with extra basil on top. The crust was thin, almost like flat bread, but the freshness of the sauce and cheese was divine--probably the healthiest pizza I've ever devoured. It was decent size and can easily be shared between 2 people. For those seeking a little crunch, I highly recommend the Lucchese Panini, which comes with prosciutto, roasted peppers, mozzarella, pesto sauce and a side of beans. The combination of flavors and crunchy texture of the panini was on point. For those more adventurous, the Spaghetti Neri con Gamberi (spaghetti with squid ink) might be an option. It's definitely interesting with a hint of fishy and reminded me of the ocean--something Queen Ursula would whip up in her kitchen. I enjoyed the first bite of the squid ink pasta, but it's not something I'll be able to finish. End dinner with some tiramisu, meant to be shared because it's huge!   Overall, I really enjoyed my meal at Piccolo Forno. I am willing to return again in the future for another dining adventure here. The wait was pretty bad, but totally worth it for the experience!"}
{"text":"This has been the best meal we've had during our visit to Pittsburgh.  The lentil and sausage soup was excellent, and the tortelli bolognese was exquisite.  We dine at many fine restaurants, and this was outstanding.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We went here the day before Valentine's Day. It was a long wait, but we went across the street to Cantina while we waited, so it wasn't bad. The place is super small, but the food is amazing. We had:  Bruschette- this was really tasty and filling Crostini di Polenta- I don't really like polenta, but this wasn't bad  Rotolo Trecolori- Loved this. It had great pesto flavor, but also you could taste the spinach, carrot, and roasted peppers. Great dish."}
{"text":"Several of my friends rave about this place.  My first attempt to eat there was before a Saturday night jazz concert.  The wait was two hours so we passed and ate at Luke Wholey's new place.    On a subsequent Friday night, we were able to be seat immediately.  I was a little taken aback by the size of the place.  It is tiny and thankfully, most diners appeared to have bathed that day, because you practically rub shoulders with other diners (strangers?).    My dining companion has dined here several times and is one of my friends who raves about the place.  But then again, she absolutely raves about any salad with walnuts.  But I digress, she recommended the salmon ravioli which I ordered along with the beef and pork meatballs as an appetizer, oh, as my antipasti choice.   The meatballs were delicious.  Easily could be made into an entree choice.  Disappointed that we had to ask for bread and what bread is offered is hard and not replenished.  I was disappointed with the salmon ravioli.  It was incredibly salty and I am usually a saltaholic who adds salt to practically everything.  The salty taste made it difficult to savor the taste of the salmon.    Would I go back?  Probably, I'm anxious to try their pasta, especially the lasagna.  I am a big seafood eater and I would like to see more seafood items on the menu.  As we left, waiting customers spilled onto the street and people were circling looking for a parking space.  We could barely exit the parking lot before someone swooped into our newly-vacant space."}
{"text":"The place is really crowded and loud. Wait times can vary upto 1.5 hours. We waited 30 mins. I had the eggplant /cheese for appetizer (excellent!). Spinach Ravioli main course (excellent too!).  However, they need more veggie options. The reason for only 3-stars is that the wait staff are way too busy to even get you more water or anything. You see them once to take the order and once to get the food. We had to wait to find them to get our bill. Food is great. Again, this place gets very very loud. You are allowed to bring your own alcohol. Parking is in a lot near the restaurant (its free)."}
{"text":"I went to Piccolo Forno last week with my boyfriend for an anniversary dinner. We went on a Tuesday night around 7 and were expecting to wait a little bit. It was pretty crowded but we were seated right away. Our waiter was friendly and quick  We really enjoyed the food. We started with the Affettati appetizer. The meats and cheeses were delicious. My boyfriend had the Cannelloni di Carne, which was really good. The walnut beschamel was delicious. I had the Rotolo Trecolori, which was a beautiful dish. I ordered it primarily because I was so interested in the appearance after looking at reviews online but it was completely worth it. The light crepe and vegetables paired so well with the rich gruyere sauce. Even the leftovers the next day were good.   We also got dessert, the bomba (caramel center in peanut butter gelato all covered in chocolate) and chocolate gelato. My boyfriend is not a huge dessert person and raved about the bomba. I thought the chocolate gelato with hazelhuts was very good too.   I thought the restaurant was really cute. I liked the oven being visible in the back. I wish they took reservations because I'd love to know I'd get a table quickly, especially with winter coming but it was good to know you can get seated quickly during the week. I definitely want to try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"This is a family favorite when they're in town. It makes sense, because my parents like this style of pizza and don't really have access to it where they're from. They eat it up, literally.  I however, have not been all THAT impressed. The pizza is okay but not great; I feel you can get better thin, bricke oven pizza elsewhere. I actually prefer their paninis. Their desserts are a bit gluttonous and, while I'm not a huge fan, once again, my family is.  Piccolo Forno seems to fit the mold of that restaurant you take the easily impressed. It's lighter on the wallet than some of the better restaurants in the city, but unique enough that your company feels like they're getting an experience.  The service is just okay. The servers are all very friendly but I have, on more than a few occasions, been left without a refill on my water. Such an easy gesture should be second nature to a server so it's a pet peeve of mine."}
{"text":"Went here because an article recommended their wood fire pizzas. I had the cream of mushroom soup, which was excellent, but the classic margherita pizza fell very short. The crust was gummy, soggy and a little over cooked. There was very little sauce and plain shredded mozzarella instead of fresh mozzarella and no fresh basil. I will not be going back for pizza but to be fair, didn't try some of the pastas that sounded excellent."}
{"text":"Went here on my birthday months ago but I still think of how good the food was. I had the wild boar pasta. amazing. We also had there version of a caprese salad so good! In fact the food was so good I had to order a pizza to go as I had no left overs to take home. I also enjoy that's it's BYOB. I took a nice bottle of wine and I don't think they charged me a bottle fee. In the end. I can't wait to go back. Only issue would be parking sucks on butler street during peek hours."}
{"text":"Food was very flavorful and the proportion was great. I thought the proportions would be small after reading yelp reviews but the actual proportion of pasta was more than enough for me. The pizza had a very thin crust which was great. This place is also BYOB which is always great!"}
{"text":"Very creative pies.  Try the pistachio pesto.  They have a proper brick oven where they fire up their pies.  Pasta also good.  BYOB is a bonus.  Friendly but efficient service.  What's more to ask?"}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburg last night visiting friends and was told that we were going to \"try\" to get a table at the \"best Italian restaurant\" in Pittsburg. Needless to say, I was excited when I found out that they had hand tossed pizza and hand made pasta. We arrived and only waited 15-20 minutes to be seating while I was eyeing every plate that I could. The aromas were amazing. The atmosphere was very laid back...oh, and I must mention that this restaurant is BYO! (A modest $5 corking fee). We brought our own wine!  Now, for the meal. The only difficulty is that they were out of butternut squash for the evening but that didn't matter because literally everything sounded amazing. We opted for the margherita pizza with prosciutto and basil to start and a basic salad. Both were unbelievable. Now, this isn't your average pizza. This is definitely a treat. Then we ordered our pasta. We opted for the spinach-filled ravioli and the roasted eggplant rigatoni. These were absolutely divine!!! The portions were hefty and the flavors were still on my tongue when I woke up. It was that good. I would make this a must for anyone visiting the area!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian I've ever had.  I was there for a dinner party, so I can't comment on the regular service, but the food was excellent.  I highly recommend the prosciutto and mushroom pizza, and the meat sauce on the pasta is incredible.  These guys could charge a lot more for this and still make it worth a trip there; as it is, I think the place attracts a cool clientele that might get a bit stuffy if they charged more."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza here is the Quattro formaggi-so much cheese to love. I love that it's BYOB, but it's a little tricky to get in here. Go as soon as they open for your best chance."}
{"text":"I've tried the pizzas and the lasagna.  I really love the pizza and need to have the lasagna again to really decide - it has an odd sauce that's tasty but not usual and wee bit heavy.  The pizzas are simply delicious and fresh.  The appetizer to get is the eggplant stack -- fantastic and interesting flavors.  This is a great place to do lunch on a weekday when you can lounge and linger and really enjoy your stay - the evenings can be noisy with brick walls and wooden floors.  I sat outside once and the traffic wasn't all that bad but we did have a gentleman stumble out of the Round Corner Cantina across the way who shouted \"F*** YOU\" very loudly and then mumbled apologies when he realized there were four tables of customers watching him.  LOL!  I say try this place if you are on the fence.  I will def go back again."}
{"text":"The most tasty and authentic Italian dishes and pizza in Pittsburgh! I hesitate to review this place because too many other people already know how good it is and now it's not unusual that one must wait for a table. But PF is good enough to wait for as long as it takes!   Service is above average by friendly and knowledgeable staff. Parking can be tough, but they have a small lot on the Strip side.  Their pizza is excellent.......bruschetta is great.....Lasagna very tasty....good salads! BYOB your best bottle for this very special place."}
{"text":"Piccolo Forno is our go to for Pizza in Pittsburgh.  They have tons of great options, the ingredients are always incredible and the pizza fresh and delicious.  They have good options for pasta and salad as well. Great for take out food, also a nice place to go with friends and family."}
{"text":"Poor customer service.   Although the food was good. My bf likes their pizzas. Pastas are very soft and I like mine al dente. Waited much longer than the anticipated wait time.   We waited for a long time and when we finally sat we were the only ones eating in the restaurant.  We also had to wait 20 minutes to get our waters. There was no explanation for the long wait and staff was not so friendly in general. This was the second time eating here in the same week (my bf really likes pizza) and we unfortunately had a similar experience the first time."}
{"text":"Entertained a small group of clients last night and received nothing but rave reviews for our choice of this restaurant.  The pasta is world class and the selection is quite unique and diverse.  My wife had the spinach ravioli and it just melted in her mouth.  The food, service and desserts were all exceptional.  Our server was very friendly and assisted us with some great suggestions.  I prefer a BYOB as I am very particular about the wine I drink.  The corkage fee was quite reasonable and the relaxed atmosphere lends itself to enjoying great food, great wine and good friends. Check you attitude at the door and enjoy an extraordinary authentic Italian meal at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"First, the quibbles: holy crap, it's loud in here! The (beautiful) brick walls definitely work as amplifiers, which turns an otherwise sweet, stylish interior ambiance into a bit of a sound box. And I'd have to agree with other reviewers who have noted the aloof, minimal attention given from servers. Ours put our check on the table in passing without even looking at us.  The menu, however, is delicious, and offers rich pastas (we had the rabbit pappardelle and vegetable cannelloni)  and what looked like inventive, tasty pizzas. On my next visit, I'll for sure give one of those a try. BYO as well with a $5 corkage fee--still far cheaper than paying in-house prices for booze."}
{"text":"Best authentic Italian pizza in Pittsburgh, hands down.  And it is BYOB!"}
{"text":"We love this place and have never had such a poor customer service experience. Since it was just my friend and I we were treated as a nuisance, and rushed out. Sadly, I do not want to ever come back here again."}
{"text":"Oh the joys.  B Y O BBBBB.  What a special pleasure.  This is a lovely little place in Lawrenceville.  That tells you a handful of things.  On Butler street, so hard to park, but you will find something after you troll around a bit.  DOES NOT take a reservation, if you come on a busy night during the main dinner hours, expect to have quite a wait.  I believe you can call ahead and put your name on the list, but am not 100% positive about that.  THE FOOD has consistently been excellent.  All of the pizzas are interesting and delicious.  There are rotating seasonal menu items, and usually a special risotto every night.  Ask your server to be honest about what to get, and you likely will not be disappointed.  I have always succumbed to their desserts, only to be soothed into a post-supping coma, never into a ranting rave of disappointment or dejection.  Piccolo Forno has continuously maintained a high degree of quality in regards to service, food preparation and authentic italian ingredients."}
{"text":"I came after work on a weekday because I heard it fills up quickly.  I kept hearing how the pizza was the best.  I ordered a pizza with pep and mushroom.  Was it the best pizza in the city?  No. Top 3?  No.  I probably ordered the wrong thing.  My dad got a pasta dish that he raved about.  I should have gone that route I suppose."}
{"text":"Just had dinner there yesterday and it was great. Started out with the pizza special of the day and a salad for the appetizer table-share, followed by the pasta entrees. I had the tagliatelle funghi, but I was a bit envious of my dining guest who had the ravioli - it looked delicious.  Don't skip the dessert course because you'll never get this high quality, unique selection anywhere else."}
{"text":"My first visit to Piccolo Forno and I will return. I was there with a larger group. Eight of us...which I'm sure would always require a reservation especially on a Saturday night. BYOB and corking fee is very reasonable.   I had a the prosciutto e rucola pizza and it was tasty. If there's arugula on a dish, I'm pretty much going to get it. The crust was sooooo thin and light, bright crushed tomatoes and who doesn't love prosciutto?   Our service was outstanding and the atmosphere is great. A little loud, but that doesn't bother me. Great place to meet with friends or an intimate date night, too.   Other dishes at the table included a lasagna, ravioli and gnocchi that would \"gnocchi\" your socks off. Those have to be on my menu next time."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are so many positive reviews.  The food is horrible.  I got the gnocchi semolina.  Giant under cooked piles of mush cornmeal or something. The braised beef short ribs on top of it was slimy and had an awful taste to it.  Two bites & I was done.  Luckily, the server was kind enough to take it off our bill.  But from his comment, they must have a problem with these \"gnocchi\" being under cooked.  Husband had the lasagna.  2 thin slabs of lasagna which he ate, but wasn't impressed with.  He cut off a small piece for me and it ran all over the plate.  Not very good.  Most Italian restaurants that we've been to give you a nice thick, meaty piece of lasagna.    Place is very small and extremely noisy.  All you keep hearing is the clanging of plates.  Stay away!"}
{"text":"Yummy Italian food. Standouts were the bruschette and stuffed calamari (this was a special appetizer, not on the regular menu). Mussels were okay. I ordered the cavatelli di limone as my entree. Flavors were good but I didn't like the texture of my pasta. For dessert we tried the tiramisu and (?) orange ginger gelato, they were both just okay.  Estimated wait was 1 hour on a Saturday night (around 6:30pm), actual wait ended up being 1 hour and 45 minutes. Ambiance was okay. It was  loud, and I felt like I was yelling at my dining companions all night.   I would probably come back, on a weeknight when it is less busy."}
{"text":"Impeccable! Fabulously fresh and delicious with sumptuous spices. Take it from me, I'm pleasantly plump."}
{"text":"the shrimp pasta had huge pieces of shrimp and was just a huge portion overall... everyone in my group enjoyed their food and desserts"}
{"text":"Went here on an impromptu dinner date with one of my friends and I must say it definitely lived up to the expectations I had from all of the things I have heard from it. When you walk in, the smell is amazing from the oven. The pizza was really good and the gnocchi was homemade and amazing as well. I will def. be back here!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I went on a Tuesday and got in around 6. There were plenty of tables and it was a gorgeous atmosphere with beautiful lighting.   I had the Ravioli con Burro E Salvia. I thought it was absolutely delicous and the portion was perfect.   I would put them as priced right for what they offered. It's a nice place to meet with friends or to go on a date, not breaking the bank but with class.   I only gave them four stars because I felt like I was being rushed out at the end. There were people waiting at the door, but I wasn't quite finished and my waitress was grabbing to wrap my plate. She was very nice and helpful with options, I don't think I had bad service at all. I think it's just best to keep in mind that if you plan on going during rush hour you will wait. If you don't want to wait, go earlier or later.   Overall, enjoyed Piccolo Forno!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was just okay. The food was ok but nothing great.  It has an intimate romantic atmosphere, but the food was lacking.  The portions were small and the waitress was very brisk and unfriendly with us, although she was very talkative and outgoing with the tables around us (it was quite obvious given the tables are about 6 inches apart in this place).  I wouldn't go back.  I would give the Grappa Bar next door a try though!"}
{"text":"Two words. Fresh pasta. I am there. I had the ricotta cavatelli with sausage and rapini. It was delicious. Because my friend and I started with the charcuterie plate, I was full after eating half of my pasta. This was absolutely perfect, because I was able to enjoy the pasta again the next day for lunch!  My other favorite thing about this place is that it is BYOB. How perfect! I can't wait to go back and try the pizzas!"}
{"text":"I would have given Piccolo Forno 5 stars if I had know that it was BYOB.  I REALLY needed a glass of wine the other night, and I was very bummed when I had to stick to Diet Coke.  The pizza crust  is delightfully crispy and thin, but the sauce is a bit too sweet for my liking.  I would still go back and order again.   Most of the specialty pizzas feature prosciutto, which one of my personal favs but my dining companion does not indulge in swine.    Next time I'm gonna try one of the pastas.  That's right, you can look forward to seeing this face again, Piccolo Forno.  Be warned and ready."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pasta place around. It's a smaller restaurant but I've never had problems getting a table without reservations. I've had rabbit (so tender!), squid ink pasta, and lasagna, all of which were delicious and hearty. I recommend the squid ink pasta the most, it was cheesy and so satisfying. BYOB too"}
{"text":"One of my favorite BYOB locations in the Pittsburgh area.  Offering a variety of simple and flavorful Italian food.  You can not go wrong with the.  I have never had a bad meal.  The pizza and raviolis are my favorite!"}
{"text":"BYOB!!!!  Delicious homemade pastas, great atmosphere.  I had the smoked salmon raviolis - so good! Want to go back to try the wood fired pizza.  There were quite a few things on the menu that appealed to me so I know I'll be back.  Prices were very reasonable. Dessert was caramel wrapped in a peanut butter gelato that was then wrapped in a chocolate shell - OH. MY. GOD. The only problem was I had to share.  Will definitely be back!  There is a bit of a wait - it's not a huge place and they only do limited reservations for larger groups (5-8) so either prepare for a wait (on a busy Fri. night it was a 90 min wait) or eat later in the evening when the crowd dies down a little (we went at 10 - no wait)."}
{"text":"This place knocks my socks off every single time.  Pizza, pasta, you name it, and it's going to be amazing.  And I love that it's BYOB...always a wait, but always worth it.  I'm a vegetarian and always find something beyond the usual here...so so so good."}
{"text":"Delicious. And BYOB. Worth the wait...go to the bar in the back, they're great!  The pizza was AMAZING and the pasta...well, YUM. JUST GO!"}
{"text":"Be prepared for a wait.  Why?  Because it's a damn good restaurant with amazing food at prices that are extremely reasonable for what you are getting. Service was fine when I went.  Everything about this place is just fresh.  BYOB if you want.  And a tip for those who are forced to wait: go across the street to Round Corner for a bit.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good salads. I did not have luck phoning in my order for delivery. Will come back for full dinner one day."}
{"text":"Four star pizza and service for sure! The pizza tastes very fresh and authentic. As someone who has had pizza snobbery ever since a trip to Italy several years ago, I have a special soft spot for a pizza that tastes truly Italian and I think they hit the nail on the head here. The service was friendly and attentive, though I did not like the fact that they will not seat until the whole party arrives, even with two people. The pasta was pretty good, I tried the Stracotto Di Cingiale Con Fettucine, but honestly I would say stick with the Pizze, that is definitely your best best. BYOB with a classic corking fee and not necessarily a great place for groups. Decent place to split a pizza with an attractive someone and a bottle of wine and call it a night."}
{"text":"Utterly delicious. I recommend the Crostini di Polenta and the Florentina Panini"}
{"text":"Meal = AMAZING. Service = GREAT. Host Staff = Snobby. Table location = THE WORST. Thus sums up our visit to Piccolo Forno. The food was sooooooo good, and honestly, I'm no fan of Italian. However, from the Butternut Squash Bruschette, to my main entree of Salmon Ravioli, topped with a \"Dream Bomba\" dessert (peanut butter gelato in a chocolate shell), everything on the table was perfection. Our service was attentive and informative and joy was had all around. The only slight annoyance of the evening is that the host staff was on the b*tchy side and the table where we dined should not be a table at all. Pressed between the back wall and a coat rack, it was really uncomfortable, and I didn't appreciate the host asking my mother in law to scoot in further so people could pass by to the restroom when there was literally no room for her to move. Tables and attitudes aside, it was a wonderful evening! You still got it, Piccolo."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  A nice quaint and cozy atmosphere when you walk in.  Not a ton a tables, with plenty of space between them so you are not listening to your neighbors conversation.    The menu features some salads, appetizers, panini's, plenty of brick oven pizzas and tons of homemade pasta options.  Yes, I said homemade, made from scratch pasta, which is fantastic.  We opted for the margarita pizza and the pappardelle with roasted rabbit.  The pizza is a delicious thin crust, with plenty of cheese and basil...the better half loved all the basil on it, though I found it to be too much...she wins.  I did enjoy the pizza, nice crisp crust on the outside, nice good chew on the inside.  The pappardelle was fantastic.  A nice sized portion too, not too big and not too small.  Pasta was good a tad al-dente, which is perfect for me.  The staff was friendly, providing us plenty of insight into the menu, including some of her favorites.  A really nice stop on Butler street.  I would certainly go back as the menu was quite appealing.  I saw several other pasta's that I would enjoy trying."}
{"text":"I like. Here's my take:  GOOD: - Quaint and fresh inside - All the pastas are house-made! - The lasagna!! - The Insalada Mista - Servers are warm and helpful  JUST OKAY: - This is a fairly small space so they do run out of tables. There is really no space inside to wait for a table ether  - They don't serve table bread   So there we go. The lasagna is fab, as is the ravioli."}
{"text":"Had a good pizza here and enjoyed sitting outside on the sidewalk. Be forewarned that this is a BYOB restaurant."}
{"text":"Read the nyt article and we were excited to try it, since we were in Pittsburgh. First of all, expectations were very high. Imagine, after the article, we expected lines around the block and a sublime experience. We split the pomodoro, e bufala (caprese by any other name) which was competent, but spare us the attitude when we ordered it as a caprese. Kath had the tortelli bolognese, sauce was good, pasta mushy (overlooked to blob consistency). I had the quatro formaggi. Which we are going to herby name quatro blando. No zip no zing no pizzazz.   Ok, the tab was reasonable, but the experience was unmemorable. Curse of the top drawer press!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food in Pittsburgh! A friend and I stopped in on a Thursday night around 7 p.m. and were seated almost immediately. This is a small restaurant so I recommend coming in on a week night or early on a weekend so you don't have to wait (they only accept reservations for parties of 5+). It is also BYOB!   After being seated, we were greeted by our waitress, Julia, who was warm, welcoming, and proved to be very knowledgable of the menu. We started with the Quattro Formaggi (white pizza topped with fresh mozzarella, Gorgonzola, crotonese, and ricotta cheese) and each ordered a pasta dish. Our pizza came out within 10/15 and was AMAZING. I recommend that particular pizza if you're looking to start with a pizza, as it is very light compared to the others. Our pasta came soon after (they definitely give you time to enjoy each course) and smelled and looked great. I had one of their permanent menu items, Tagliatelle con Agnello in Umido. The lamb was cooked beautifully, tender and flavorful - overall the pasta dish was excellent. And very filling. My friend had the wild mushroom ragu pasta dish which also had great flavor. (Tip: they do not bring bread to the table with your entrees, but on request, you will receive the most buttery bread!)   We ended our evening with a desserts to share - Tiramisu and the Limoncello gelato. The piece of tiramisu was huge, and delicious. If you are not crazy about the espresso flavor, this is the tiramisu for you! I personally love the flavor, but my friend isn't a huge fan and really liked this it. And the gelato was very refreshing and tart. Overall, our experience was extremely enjoyable and relaxed. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and good service! It little hard to park nearby and the restaurant is always full though."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, appetizers great also. Never had the pasta but I saw many people ordering it.  Our waitress however was terrible. She managed to convince us within the first 10 seconds that she rather be anywhere else but there. I have seen miserable waitresses before but nothing like this one. She seemed annoyed by any question or request. It seriously made me want to leave. But I really like their pizza, so I stayed and battled through her crappy attitude. Next time if she's still there I'll make sure to ask to be seated in someone else's section. She charged us corkage fee for a beer but didn't open it nor offered a glass for it. She has short hair and wears glasses in case you wonder; I don't remember her name. Maybe the owner decides to clean up his closet b/c customer service does matter. Or at least tell the stuff that smiling and being nice is mandatory. If this was my place I would be furious to know that my stuff is disrespectful to customers."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night around 6 pm and about half the tables were available in a lovely surprise. Got the appetizer involving some charcuterie (pepperoni and prosciutto) and cheeses, which was tasty. I ended up with the cannelloni di carne, which was an excellent dish filled with pork and prosciutto and squash and my dining partner got the tagliatelle con ragu di agnello, which really had a lovely lamb flavor all over the pasta. The service was helpful and polite and would return again for a special dinner. The real question is can I really limit myself to one entree next time?"}
{"text":"Very crowded and noisy at 6 pm on a Friday. We were seated right away, but both our chairs were in aisle ways, Patrons waiting for a table were bumping into us while we ate. We had the pasta special, butternut squash ravioli. Very salty, not really edible. Butternut squash soup was very different from others; it was not cream based. There were a couple pieces of squash in a soup that was mostly kale. My appetizer, the sweet red peppers with breadcrumbs and Parmesan was superb! Tiramsu was outstanding, The waitress with a piercing in her nose was disgusting in a classy restaurant.....loose the piercing when you are serving others. And please do not take my used fork from my appetizer and put it on the table for later use......get me a new one!  Yuck!!!"}
{"text":"I just don't understand the great ratings.   I really wanted to love this place.  I like the feel of it inside and the service is pretty good.  I have had the pizza 4 times because I really wanted to like it, but it is very bland.  I don't think people in our region have had good pizza, so this seems good to them I guess.  I haven't had other items, except a salad for a starter.  The salad was very good and I might go just for that, but really wanted to find a good pizza place in Pittsburgh.  Oh well."}
{"text":"This place is a bit small but the atmosphere is great.   This restaurant is B.Y.O.B. and we had a few minutes wait while our table was being set up so my sister asked if they could open our wine to let it breathe while we waited.  They were happy to accomodate which was great.  For an appetizer, we tried their Torre di Melanzane (which was pretty tasty) as well as a Prosciutto e Funghi (tasty as well!) . We selected Lasagne (divine!) and the Tagliatelle con Ragu di Agnello (tasty but I wished I had selected the Lasagne!).  No room for dessert as I happily finished my entire entree!  I'd definitely be back, but would order their Lasagne...  *N.B. You can only have reservations if you have a party of 5 or more."}
{"text":"Really excellent food at very fair prices.  I love eating at Picolo Forno!  First things you should know is that there are no reservations, unless you have a party of 5 or more.  It's very loud, it's BYOB, and the food is fantastic.  I had the Cavatelli con Salsccia e Rapini, which was amazing and I will order this again.  People rave about the Lasgna, although I don't think that is their best dish.  I love the Crostini di Polenta, it's a perfect appetizer.  The Bomba is always a fun dessert."}
{"text":"I'm actually not fully confident in my ability to write this review without drooling on my keyboard...   Piccolo Forno is, in short, AMAZING.  Being the half-blooded carb-loving Italian that I am, I had heard great things about this place before finally checking it out a little over a year ago.  The first plus is that its BYOB. Sure, they charge a corkage fee ($5), but unlike most restaurants with a liquor license, you can have the wine/beer/liquor of your choice for a much smaller price.   The food... oh the food.  I highly recommend starting with the Affettati plate (meats and cheeses) to tide you over until the real games begin.  As for the main courses, my favorites are the salmon ravioli and the tagliatelle with mushroom ragu.  Even once you're stuffed beyond belief, you'll find room for juuuuust one more bite.  Their pizza is also phenomenal.  My favorite combo is pepperoni, basil and ricotta, but you'd be hard pressed to find something that DOESN'T taste good.  The only downside is that they don't take reservations for parties of less than 5, and they get rather busy in the evenings, especially on weekends. Be prepared to wait, but also to be pleasantly surprised once you make your way inside.  Worst case scenario, just pop open your bottle of wine to pass the time!  I've found the best time to go and not have a wait is on Tuesday or Wednesday evenings.  Each time I've gone on one of these nights, I've been seated immediately with my party of 2-3 people.  Buon appetito!"}
{"text":"So I should say first  this review is based solely on the service I received yesterday....   I love their food. I've eaten here probably about 20x in the past few years, I even has my bachelorette dinner here and enjoyed it every time.   However, yesterday I went for lunch with my 5 month old and my friend with her child. The restaurant wasn't full, in fact it only had one other table occupied with another mom and her toddler. My waitress seemed annoyed that I was there. She slammed drinks on the table, curt responses and a general unpleasant feeling. I can handle all that, but what really pisses me off is when I turned discretely away from the dinning room, draped a blanket over myself and child to nurse her she made appalled faces. Come on people! I'm not having sex on a table, I'm feeding my daughter!!!   Not sure if I'll return which makes me sad because I really do enjoy the food and atmosphere and it's a shame that this waitress made me feel unwelcome.   And FYI I still left a decent tip because I'm a nice person."}
{"text":"Maybe 3 stars if I didn't have high exectations based on other reviews.  The food just wasn't that good."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Pittsburgh, friends took us here and it did not dissapoint. We brought a bottle of wine and had a slow, relaxing, delicious dinner over the next couple of hours. I had the mozzarella/tomato salad, the mushroom pasta, and the tiramisu. My entire meal was perfect, the staff was attentive, and the ambiance was lovely. I can't wait to go to Piccolo Forno again."}
{"text":"If you enjoy giving your taste buds a treat, try out the pizza here. WOW. Piccolo Forno is a great date night spot. The wait was way shorter than projected, so we had to leave our beer at Cantina to catch our table ((sad face)) but BYOB, good apps and great pizza was worth it. The atmosphere was great and service was good. Definitely need to try it out."}
{"text":"What can I say about Piccolo Forno that hasn't already been said in all the wonderful reviews on this page?  My husband and I go here several times a week since our business is up the street.  Not only do they have the best food and ambiance, the staff there is just so great.  Always service with a smile.  Whenever I go there, I always know that I'm going to have a great meal and a great experience."}
{"text":"Finally able to enjoy the great food at this wonderful restaurant.  The good news -- which, from the recent reviews, isn't really news -- is that PF now takes reservations for parties of five or more.  Our group -- six -- didn't know that, but we were there early on a Friday night (6.00p) so we were able to get seated within 15 minutes.  My wife and I love Italian food and we CRAVE fresh-made food in restaurants (not the pre-cooked, bagged, frozen and steamed stuff served as the chain restaurants or delivered by food service companies to local bars).  We found BOTH at PF.    We ordered a couple of appetizers: the bruschetta and the cheese/salami plate.  Both were fine, about what you'd expect in any of the local Italian eateries.    Salads and soup followed.  The salads were delicious.  Fresh greens, tasty house dressing.  The carrot soup was spot-on good.    For entrees, we ordered a variety of dishes.  A friend selected the eggplant salad as an entree.  I'm not a fan of eggplant, but she loved it.  Several pasta dishes appeared on the table.  The pastas were cooked perfectly, the variety of ingredients in each dish were not \"mashed\" together but retained their individual flavors.  I ordered the prosciutto/arugula pizza (I know, boring!) and was surprised to finally see authentic Italian pizza in Pittsburgh.   Just like the pizza I get when I'm in northern Italy.    A couple of desserts hit the table, but I didn't try them.    I love the business model at PF: fair prices for the food and BYOB.  We walked out of there on Friday having spent only $30 per person (including a 20% tip) plus the cost of a bottle of wine that each couple brought from home.    I've seen the complaints about noise.   Honestly, we found that part of the charm of the place.  It also allowed us to be as raucous as we wanted to be.    I'm so glad we finally made it for dinner.  We'll be going again, soon.  And I scoped out the Round Corner Cantina across the street.  If we go there and have a bit of a wait in the future, we'll go to the Cantina and have a drink."}
{"text":"piccolo forno has been a part of my family's rotation of restaurants since it opened. regardless of the fact they offer a concise, simple menu, we have no problem returning time after time.  the handmade pizzas are definitely the main attraction here, but the pasta and salads also great.  while the menu is modest, there are always additional specials which seem to fit in with exactly what you were hungry for."}
{"text":"Piccolo Forno is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The prices are great.  BYOB means I can bring whatever I want to drink, though I have to plan an appropriate quantity of drink.  Piccolo is upscale Italian.  Every meal I've had has been amazing.  I've had their panini's, their pizza, and several pasta dishes.  Their desert is amazing.  The tiramisu is huge and awesome.  Make sure to make a reservation."}
{"text":"Plus one for the BYOB and good company, plus one for the sidewalk table....  And then....I try and love the food as much as every one else does, but I just haven't had this feeling yet in all of my visits here. I'm still going to blame it on the things that I order though (calzone) because the gnocchi dish my friends got was outstanding.   We were a little annoyed that we had to ask for bread....when all of the tables around us had it already, but we lived. :)   So my word of advice would be, go for the pasta, not a calzone and you'll be happy!"}
{"text":"I feel like I wouldn't be doing anybody any favors if I didn't lead this review off with some down and dirty facts. Fact number one, our server was wonderful, but the greeter at the front door had the personality of a senior employee at the DMV. Show up with your entire party at one time, or wait for them in your car. Speaking of cars, fact number two, there is off street parking available for patrons, free of charge. Third fact, most important fact, BYOB... they do charge for a cork service, so bring your own chilled wine and they'll gladly serve it to you.  You may be wondering how this little joint, full of so much difficulty, is deserving of a 5 star rating. It's simple, I can say beyond a reasonable doubt, that I may not have know what real food tasted like, until I tasted the food they serve at Piccolo Forno! That is not even close to an exaggeration! From foods that I can barely pronounce, to the gelato crafted in house, anything you get here is guaranteed to please! I will certainly jump through the hoops to return to this classy little hole in the wall every opportunity I get! Oh yeah, the prices are actually quite reasonable. Be sure and grab an appetizer as the portions are well controlled."}
{"text":"Fantastic! They get busy pretty early and make sure that you hear the specials, the specials are amazing! Both my dining partner andI were more than happy!"}
{"text":"It's a contest between Piccolo Forno and Il Pizziolo for who can deliver the best Italian Wine Bar style pizza. Not necessarily a meal like we might expect, this is snacking pizza.   As a city, we've come to tolerate Mineo's as a standard, even though that pie would have done best being served in 1985 at Pizza Hut. Piccolo Forno doesn't approach pizza with the same regard as a heavy, greasy comfort food, and the overall build is far lighter and more dignified - like it should be.  If Il Pizziolo's is a little wetter, Piccolo Forno's a little crunchier. Satisfying in a pinch, the pizza here shows signs of a temperamental oven and was presented with an unevenness in the cooking. I want a char on the bottom; not a spotty blackness. Sauce and cheese to cover the margherita were good but not particularly notable.  I won't call it bad, but I can't say I'm altogether impressed. I would certainly eat it again, but for the price, in Pittsburgh, I expect something a little more to weigh me down."}
{"text":"Piccolo Forno never disappoints, but tonight I had an even more exceptional experience. My husband and I arrived so hungry that I must have spaced reading the menu. I (a vegetarian) looked down at my meal when it arrived, and noticed there was meat on my plate. This was 100% my fault, the waitress brought me exactly what I ordered. I felt silly, and debated eating around the meat, but my husband spoke up and explained our situation. The waitress immediately apologized (again..my fault) and offered to have the dish re-made without meat. It came back fresh, delicious and super fast. This is the kind of courtesy that you hope for at a restaurant, but don't always achieve. Piccolo Forno once again earned my affection tonight!"}
{"text":"By far my most favorite Italian spot in the city! I find myself going here for every special occasion to get a margherita pizza. It's the closest one I've found after living in Italy! It's a BYOB so we always grab huge amounts of wine and stay for a while. I'd highly recommend checking this out with family or friends. Be sure to reserve if you have a party greater than 6. You'll have to wait most nights if you're a small party, but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I do not normally like pasta and a friend convinced me to try here. They make all their pasta home made and you can defiantly tell. The food was amazing and we got to sit outside in November. Wait staff was exceptional and on point even though they were very busy. I will definitely add to my available options for dinning."}
{"text":"Top to bottom, stellar. First time here and I had heard rage reviews about 2 items.. the pizza, and the lasagna. Naturally i had to get them both. Our table split a margarita pizza with ricotta and hot sausage-- seriously life changing. I sort of wish I had just gotten that as my meal so I could eat it all myself. But I didn't, I got the lasagna and it was ridiculously good. My wife got the tortelli (I believe it was called) it's sort of like tortellini, sort of like ravioli, but also- tremendous. Our waiter was very pleasant and had answers to every question we asked. Two huge thumbs up"}
{"text":"Ravioli stuffed with squash was very nice. Great atmosphere. Friendly service. And most importantly BYOB!!!"}
{"text":"Love their pizza! We only go there for the margarita pizza it's amazing me and my husband were full from one pizza which costs only $12 if you're hungry and you want good and delicious pizza but don't want to sell an arm and a leg for that this is your place!"}
{"text":"Initial thoughts: I've heard really great things about Piccolo Forno, but based on my experience, it's not really worth a try.   Parking: There is a parking lot a block or so in front of the restaurant that can be hard to notice if you're driving on the other side. Avoid street parking costs and park there for free!   Wait time: I came around 3pm on a Monday in February so there was no wait. The restaurant had only a few tables occupied.   Service: The hostess was fine. She told us to sit anywhere, and came around a few times to take our order, refill our glasses, and bring us our leftovers in to-go containers.   Main dish: We got the \"Butternut squash tortellini with amaretto brown butter sauce\" and \"Squid ink spaghetti with rock shrimp and squid.\" Both were subpar. The tortellini itself was good, but the sauce was pretty unappetizing. It was too sweet and didn't match well flavor-wise with the already sweet butternut squash. I felt like someone overloaded the amaretto extract, and it was just not that great. I would've like the tortellini by itself. The spaghetti was okay - somewhat bland and lacked both salt and herbs.    Cost: Around $20, more or less, for each dish. For this price, I expected much better.   Ambience: Casual Italian dining. Somewhat small.   Overall: Just okay. I don't think I would go back here based solely on the food. If the food was better, I would reconsider."}
{"text":"The two of us went for dinner around 9pm on a Friday and got a table after a short wait. The atmosphere was very loud and lively; just what we were looking for that night. Being our first time there, we wanted to try the pizza and the pasta. We split a pizza with prosciutto and mushrooms and the baked rigatoni with eggplant and cheese. The pizza was phenomenal. The pasta was good, but really paled in comparison. We definitely plan to go back for pizza. Dessert items were all different types of gelato, which initially was not clear to use from the way the menu described it. We got the lemon, and it was really good."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant only downsize was busy so you have to book a reservation well in advance. Loved we could bring in our own wine. Service was good and pizzas large enough to share."}
{"text":"Really wonderful food. Service left a bit to be desired, though."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! We were lucky to get a table on Black Friday for 8 of us because they were totally packed when we walked in. We waited across the street for drinks and got in about 45 minutes later. By then it had emptied out quite a bit and the noise level was low and the service was fantastic. I'd definitely recommend at dining during \"off\" hours.   Everything we had to eat was absolutely awesome, but the lasagna was my favorite! The pizza and the bruschetta were the other popular ones at the table. The rabbit pappardelle wasn't as great as the other pasta dishes, but this is definitely a new Pittsburgh fave!"}
{"text":"Took my boyfriend here for his birthday; we were looking for some classic, quality Italian cuisine and were pleasantly surprised by the stylish ambiance of the place. Food was fantastic - forgot it was BYOB - but was a bit soured on the place when the waiter brought our bill with a \"here's the check, sir.\" I know the convention is for the male member of a couple today, but considering I was taking him out the gendered language qualified as faux pas. After making a big show of taking the check myself, the waiter picked it up with a not much better \"thanks guys\" (eyeroll)."}
{"text":"This is a great place to enjoy genuine wood fired pizza, as one would in Italy.  The menu is fairly limited, but the pizzas are delicious.  We were surprised to learn how child friendly the place was.  They provided the kids with some dough (not money, dough), to goof with while waiting for the meal."}
{"text":"I really have mixed feelings about this place.   Maybe a 3.5, but there were some negatives that can't push it above that.    On one hand... - I would totally go back for the mortadella and pistachio pizza.    That was by far the winning dish.  The risotto was good, but way too heavy for me to really crave again.  The lemon cavatelli was great and fresh, though slightly too lemony for my taste.   - The portions were large.  Most of us could only finish half of what we ordered - hello leftovers!   - The service was good overall.    - l like the BYOB concept (though see below for a caveat here).    On the other... - It was SOOOOO hot and stuffy in there.  We were all sweating all the way through our meal.    - They don't take reservations except for large parties.  I just hate that in general.   It is compounded here by the fact that if you have to wait, there's no place to do it.  You have to stand outside or go somewhere else.    - Their corkage fees are ridiculous.  $5 per bottle no matter how many bottles you bring.  Charge me a buck for the wine glass and call it a day.   So annoying.    - The ground boar ragu was not my favorite.  If I'd ordered that, I've have been disappointed by the very gamey taste of the dish.    - Our party of 8 was sat at a table really meant for 6 - another peeve of mine.  It was pretty crowded overall and the people that sat along the aisle kept getting bumped by people headed to the bathroom.    Overall, we had fun and everyone enjoyed the meal.  But the negatives are kick this out of my go-to category."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try Piccolo Forno for dinner. My friend and I went tonight (Thursday around 7pm) and got seated right away. It's BYOB and reservations are for groups 5 and more - so tonight was the perfect night to go.   Our waitress Julia was very informative and was able to answer all our questions (regarding the most popular pizzas and pastas)   We started with a pizza to share. We split the Quattro Formaggio (a white pizza topped with fresh mozzarella, Gorgonzola, crotenese, and ricotta) - it was delicious. It was the perfect pizza pie to share for an appetizer. It was light and refreshing.   For my main course (I went with Julia's suggestion over the traditional lasagna) - I tried the Fettuccine con Sugo di Funghi (porcini and wild mushroom ragu with porcini funghi and grated truffles percorni) - it was amazing and i would definitely get this dish again. My friend got Tagliatelle con Agnello in Umido (the braised lamb dish) - she let me taste it and it was out of this world. It was amazing.   For dessert- I opted for the Limoncello gelato (it was the perfect ending to this meal) - My friend ordered the Tiramusi (it was so good I'd order it next time as well)  Overall, I enjoyed my Thursday night at Piccolo Forno and will be back again soon."}
{"text":"If you've been to Piccolo Forno once, you love it. You know you do. Such a great place complete with a terrific atmosphere, amazingly fresh and authentic Italian food, and its BYOB!! What more could you want? Oh, yeah, the crowds not being there, I get it. But here's a hint, go early. But those that go are in the know. There's a reason people flock here. It's that good.  We've been a few times and are always anxious to go back. Yep, we've had pizza of all sorts (with our wine), pasta of all sorts (with our bottle of wine), soups and salads (yep, you guessed it, with our wine) and EVERYTHING has been amazing. The salads are imaginative and filled with fresh ingredients. The pasta is delicious and varied to the point you can get braised boar or braised rabbit with it if you're so inclined. The spinach tagliatelle with the tomato and olive lamb ragu is a clear winner. Or you can try one of my favorites - the Tortelli - yummy dough pockets filled with a blend of pork and beef in a spectacular Bolognese sauce. And the pizzas? Wood fired delights that are covered with fresh mozzarella and a selection of toppings that would make your Italian grandmother envious. I like the Margherita with the option of adding prosciutto, speck, tuna, and gorgonzola.  Eat here. Bring lots of wine. Sit back and enjoy. Oh, and save me a seat."}
{"text":"Had a delicious lunch on Saturday sharing the salad with tuna and pasta in a white veal ragu. Both were excellent. As for dinner, come early or  be prepared to wait, or bring some friends and make a reservation (only accepted for parties of 5 to 8 people).  People,sitting next to us were regulars and claim they make the best pizza in town. I will be back to try it the next time I'm in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I had extremely HIGH expectations for this place. I have heard great things from people, but today my expectations were dropped to the floor almost instantly.   We walked in and were seated immediately. I noticed that their menu items change due to pictures on Yelp from 8 months ago not being on their menu today. Our waitress took sometime to come to our table and when she did come over I sensed that she wasn't going to be the most personable waitress and boy was I right. She was pretty rude when it came to us asking questions about the menu. My mom asked if she could omit an ingredient from her meal and she was rude about and said no they can't do that. Why is it that big of a deal to leave something out? I asked if I could have cavatelli instead of cannelloni with my salsiccia e rapini that had sausage and rapini with red pepper beschamel and gruyere cheese. I know that it was a menu item a while back but instead of filling the cannelloni it had cavatelli noodles. That couldn't be done either. Something as easy and swapping out pastas, whatever. We waited a while for our meal to arrive and my mom received hers before I got mine because apparently the kitchen made the wrong thing. Figures. The waitress asked if we wanted bread in the mean time, shouldn't we have gotten bread from the get go? Not when our meals came out? The food was mediocre. My mom said her risotto was on the salty side. Another waitress had to come to our table to ask if we were finished because our waitress was behind the counter eating. She boxed our food up in the back and then never brought it back out for us...so we asked if we could have our food so we can leave. Overall, this was an unpleasant experience and it all stemmed from terrible service."}
{"text":"Awesome spot for Italian in Lawrenceville. It's small and doesn't do reservations, so expect to wait with a drink at the bar across the street. The restaurant is byob. The food is incredible and very reasonably priced for the portion and quality. Romantic and fun, definitely recommend. Pizza is awesome, pasta is fantastic. You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Fantastic meal!  I had the lasagna, and it was a great portion size. I'm the type who wants to leave a restaurant full and not thinking about what kind of cereal I am going to have when I get home. Here, I couldn't even finish the meal! And it was hot when it was served! Very fresh!  Great ambience! The staff was extremely friendly! Went for my sister's birthday and they were very polite and took our cake and chilled the wine. The restaurant is great inside also with a modern, friendly atmosphere that is perpetuated by the great staff.  Affordable! Nothing on the menu is over $20. For 7 people, the bill was only $160! And it is BYOB with only a small corkage fee of $5 per bottle (not cup like other restaurants)."}
{"text":"Excellent Italian cooking, very popular with Pittsburgh locals. No reservations, and there is ( am told) always a queue at dinner time at this very popular, excellent Italian restaurant. But you can leave your name and cell phone number and repair to a coffee and tea shop a block away, to be called when your table is ready. (The wait was an hour on a weeknight.. The food is VERY good and well worth the wait. Helpful and attentive wait staff, able to explain the menu. Bring your own wine/beer."}
{"text":"I get it!  This place is REALLY popular and always has a wait!  I totally understand, but that doesnt give the hostess a reason to be RUDE!   My group of 6 called ahead to make reservations for dinner on a Saturday but the reservations were all filled.  We decided to go anyway and knew we would have to wait.  We walk in to put our name on the list.  The hostess was extremely short and seemed like she didnt want to be bother with walk-ins.  \"We are packed on Saturday nights, and it will be an hour and half wait.\"  We were fine with that. \"We book up months in advance for weekend reservations.\"  Ok, we get it, still fine with waiting. \"We dont have a waiting area, so you have to give your number and Ill call you. \"  Totally expected this, not a big deal.  (Imagine this with a huge attitude, as if this is the only restaurant in the world that is ever packed)  My group walks across the street to round corner for a beer.  You can imagine the surprise when 20 minutes later the hostess calls and tells us our table is ready.  We quickly finish our beers, pay the tab and run over for our table.  Well......we walk in and she is surprised to see us.  She says she made a mistake and called the wrong party.  WHAT?!!  We just \"chugged\" down our drink and \"ran\" over here because we didnt want to loose our precious table and \"you made a mistake.\"  She didnt really apologize and sent us away again.  We walked across the street to Frankutary.  They have a very nice selection of beers on tap.  Then the wait was another hour and ten minutes.   The good news is, when we went back the manager greeted us.  She apologized and brought a pizza to our table immediately.   (Which is good, because I had 2 beers on an empty stomach, I was ready to eat!) The waitress was really nice and got our orders in promptly.   The food is really quite good!  The pasta is fresh and cooked perfectly!  The pizzas are thin and crisp.   Really too bad that some of the staff needs an attitude check!"}
{"text":"In a word.... LASAGNA!  Love the BYOB, love the service (minus the mean lady I spoke to when I made a reservation, even her confirmation call was rude and nasty and not friendly), love the overall experience.    Prices are more than reasonable for the portion size... we had 4 dinners, 3 salads, corkage fee, an app for under 90.00.  The waitress was fabulous and when we had  spill was there in no time with a rag and helping clean up.    I had been here before with a less than stellar experience, but this time (on a pleasure dinner, not for work like the previous visit which can explain why I was less than happy) it was one of the best experiences I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Set out for good Italian food and was not disappointed.  At least half of the menu is pizza, but tonight we were in a sampling mode, so we chose appetizers and pasta. Half our party started with an antipasto with meat, cheese, and a delightful addition of mustard seeds. The other half had an asparagus appetizer with burrata and pesto. Mmm to both. Tried the cannelloni, spinach ravioli in sage butter and tortellini in bolonaise. Tender homemade pasta with fresh ingredients that compliment rather than overwhelm. BYOB Good service with a sense of humor"}
{"text":"I have really mixed feelings about this place.  I could definitely see someone who is into the type of vibe this place provides giving them 5 stars.  I just was not a huge fan of several aspects of Piccolo Forno.  I went here because I wanted homemade pasta.  I will say that my meal, the spinach ravioli was very good...not great, but very good.  The appetizer of bruschetta was also good, as was my wife's pizza.  Having said that, there are a few things I did not like.  One, there is no customization options with any of their pasta dishes.  If you simply want their homemade pasta with regular tomato sauce, they won't do it.  This seems odd to me with how many people nowadays who have specific food types they eat or avoid.  Another thing that I did not like was how limited the menu was.  There are very few options for the appetizers, pasta, and pizza.  Finally, I did not like the atmosphere.  It was way too stuffy and I felt like my wife and I were being too loud.  If you are into a place that has very select food, where people spin their wine in their glasses trying to look cool, while whispering to each other...maybe you will enjoy it here."}
{"text":"Uniquely authentic Italian food.  Specials are okay.  Menu doesn't change much.  Highly recommended that you at least try the place, but do yourself a favor and don't go when it's crowded.  Weekend evenings are usually overflowing (for good reason) and the hostess is not at all accommodating.  We go there a lot for weekend lunches and weeknight dinner.  Certainly one of the top five Italian spots in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Yum!   This spot serves up some delicious Italian and its BYOB.   I'm a creature of habit when I go here.   A bowl of pasta fagioli and a salad.  The soup is hearty, meat free and HUGE.  The salads are also massive.  If you are looking for a side salad, you are out of luck.  Ask your date to split it or you won't have room for your meal.  I follow up this healthy start with the Dream Bomba.  Gelato in a chocolate candy coated shell with peanut butter and a caramel center????   Who could resist topping their meal off with that?    I also recommend their pizzas and the homemade risotto which is creamy and delicious.  It's not a huge place so at dinner time and particularly weekends, be prepared for a long wait (and not in the restaurant because there isn't much standing room.)"}
{"text":"I came here for a friends birthday. I got the mushroom pizza and it was really good. everyone enjoyed their food. Love that it is byob! I just weigh they would do call ahead or use no wait to avoid long waits."}
{"text":"If there are down sides to the restaurant they are these...no reservations, and no wine menu.  The workarounds are relatively simple:  put your name on the list, then go next door to Grapperia to grab a cocktail or two while you wait, then bring a bottle next door when you return.  This worked really well for me, but did have the unforseen side effect of pigeon-holing me with a dish that would pair well with the wine I'd selected (it had a dragon on it that breathed fire, and the fire had \"burned away\" part of the label.  It was a Pinot Noir, which is a decent wine if you have to pick one, but if we're really being honest I picked it because of the label, which kicked ass.)  Next time around...and there will be a next time (the food was really good) I'll peruse the menu first, then whilst awaiting my callback...I'll pick a wine that pairs with that dish.  Because of the Pinot though (and also because it sounded good) I picked the  Pappardelle con Coniglio e Funghi...Braised rabbit with pappardelle pasta, roasted tomatoes and wild mushrooms.  At $17, I thought the price point was really reasonable (I know pasta isn't generally super expensive, but I still thought it was sane).  It was earthy and had a nice balance of pepper to it.  Paired well with my flaming dragon wine (the name...I don't remember the name, but that dragon is burned indelibly into my mind like the label from the bottle).    Service was casual and well-informed, prompt and courteous.    Ambience was clean and casual, well-lit, cheerfully...Tuscan?  Someone who knows stuff will have to check that.  I thought of Tuscany.    Dessert was a very well executed Tiramisu.    A nice experience overall."}
{"text":"I could see my waiter scream inside his head when I asked for just water. It turned out fine for him. I ordered the pomodoro e buffala salad which was amazing. Tortelli was awesome and I really enjoyed the bolognese sauce. We were not rushed, due to the tame lunch crowd, and enjoyed our coffee."}
{"text":"Yet another restaurant on my want-to-visit-before-I-leave-PGH list, I was able to check off Piccolo Forno the Sat. before last.  I was on a bike ride with a friend and we planned to stop by, and we managed to time our arrival at 5pm--my preferred time to avoid the Sat. crowds.  At the time of our arrival, we were seated immediately with no wait and were able to enjoy a leisurely early dinner as the crowd begun to surge in half an hour later.  We started off by splitting an order of bruschetta ($7), which intrigued us with its interesting ingredients (mint chevre, basil pesto, etc.).  Both of us especially enjoyed the one with the snow pea relish, which was pickled and made a nice complement to the chevre.  The pesto one was alright, but nothing too out of the ordinary, and we both actively disliked the one with the red pepper tapenade (this shouldn't surprise me given that I'm not a huge fan of either red pepper *or* tapenades).  Props to the owners for creating such interesting and varied bruschetta rather than just serving up the same old tomato-based version that every other Italian restaurant in town serves.  For our entree, we ordered the mortadella e pistachio pizza to split ($17).  Despite having sampled a *lot* of pizzas of different varieties (traditional American, Neapolitan, \"fancy,\" etc.) around PGH, this pie is my favorite one I've tried in the city.  The pistachio lends a really unique earthy yet sweet/savory flavor to the pesto, making it unlike any other version of pesto I've ever tried.  Its unique flavor is complemented by undertones of saltiness from small cubes of cured mortadella, as well as the texture and subtle creaminess of fresh burrata mozzarella.  The only aspect of this pizza I found wanting was the crust, which was on the doughy side and lacked the characteristic crispness I enjoy in pizza crust.  Nevertheless, I'm willing to overlook this shortcoming due to the perfect marriage of flavors and textures endowed by the toppings.  For dessert, I tried a scoop of strawberry basil gelato ($2).  Its texture was creamy and its flavors were subtle yet delicious.  It's the type of dessert that grows on you rather than the type that captivates you at first bite but quickly overwhelms and tires your taste buds.  Initially, my dining companion said it wasn't his preferred type of dessert, but after savoring it for a moment, he quickly came around and really enjoyed it.  Aside from the food, we were impressed at how well run Piccolo Forno is.  All of the small yet significant aspects of the dining experience, such as clearing and bringing plates at the right times and bringing pre-organized split checks, were on point, as was the service.  It's quite clear why they're such a well-respected and attended restaurant in the PGH dining scene despite the plethora of new entrants in the Lawrenceville market.  Needless to say, we were quite impressed and would definitely return--if only I weren't moving out of PGH so soon.  4.5 stars."}
{"text":"Place is as good as Italian as I have had since moving to Pittsburgh 2 years ago. I used to work for a guy who was straight from Italy and his food, to this day, is the best Italian food I've ever had, but PF comes pretty close. Fresh homemade pasta. Excellent gravy. Really good meatballs, although I would of liked some red gravy to go with the meatballs, the pesto that accompanied them was quite delightful. I will absolutely be back. Next time I'm trying the pizza. Looked nice and thin for those of us who love a nice thin crust."}
{"text":"Piccolo Forno, I heard so much about you. And yet I have a fear of bad Italian food so I avoided you and avoided you...and eventually I just had to bite the bullet and make a visit to the most talked about Italian joint in town. Could it beat the reigning champs of my Italian heart, Dish Osteria and Il Pizzaiolo?  The answer was no. The pizza here claims to be authentic, but it is not so. The crust is decent, though it could use a bit more char. Where it really goes wrong though is the sauce, which has a strong oregano taste. Generally, authentic Italian pizza uses just crushed San Marzano tomatoes and basil...and I'm not a fan of oregano, so I prefer when places just stick to that simple recipe. It wasn't the worst pizza ever, but it's not as good as Il Pizzaiolo in Mt. Lebanon, which is the only place in the state that is officially VPN-certified to make authentic pizza. If Piccolo Forno is the best pizza you've ever had, take a trip down to the suburbs and prepare to have your mind blown.  The pasta, on the other hand, was really delicious. The Maccheroni con Melanzane (basically Italian mac and cheese with eggplant) was creamy, cheesy, and awesome. Again, it doesn't compare to Dish, but I really liked it nonetheless. If I come back, I'll definitely skip the pizza and go straight for the pasta menu!  3.5 stars...but I'm rounding down because there is way too much hype for this place and ultimately the pizza was a let down. Not worth waiting 1-2 hours as others seem to have done, but we went early around 5pm and there was no wait at all, and still many empty tables by the time we left."}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza here is outstanding and so is the pasta. A great spot for a conversational dinner or pizza to go. Love the eggplant pizza"}
{"text":"This was my second time here and I can say I was extremely satisfied. I had the Capricciosa pizza which was truly delightful.. Light, crunchy and full of flavor. I also had  their special of the day which was an incredible ravioli dish.. Possibly one of the best pasta I've ever had."}
{"text":"After years and years of looking, I found a place that makes lasagne just slightly under as good as my mom's homemade one. That's saying a lot.  We also tried the Quattro formaggi pizza which usually I don't like/go for since I'm more of a ~tomato base~ kinda gal but this was excellent!! We also tried the tagliatelle con sugo di funghi which was 10/10. I wish our stomachs would have let us try more from the menu but sadly this was the end of a meal I wished wouldn't end.   Great atmosphere and service too! Even if the wait is long, it's worth it! You can go have a drink across the street and they call when you're up. I would definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The food is always very good, but it is a pain that they do not take reservations. On the night before thanksgiving I was eating with some friends and the manager was very rude. We were the last ones in the restaurant, but it was by no means late (10:15). If the manager has asked us to leave politely we would have been perfectly ok. However, she was very rude with the way she asked us to leave. I was entertaining friends from out of town. Frankly, it was embarrassing for me that a \"popular\" restaurant is Pittsburgh closes so early and was so rude to us."}
{"text":"Always one of our favorites - a great Lawrenceville gem when you're craving wood-fired pizza. Super tough to get into, so recommend that you go early or later since they don't take reservations for parties less than 5. Evening rush started at 5:45 when we were there last Friday.   Recommend the lasagna and any of the wood-fired pizzas. Most pizzas have arugula or cold meats, so often we'll skip in favor of margherita or built our own with add-ons like eggplants, ricotta cheese or an egg. Mmm delish! Pizzas are the perfect size for two people to split.   Also BYBO, which is always a plus!   Space is tiny and there's no lobby so you'll have to wait for your table outside or you can grab a drink at Roundcorner Cantina or Franctuary."}
{"text":"This place tried punking out my family cause they're Irish. Making them wait 2 hrs while seating everyone else. I wouldn't eat here again cause I could just go get some Ragu on the cheap"}
{"text":"Nowhere near as good as I had expected with the reviews that it has!  Very very loud atmosphere you can barely hear yourself talking and the food is definitely nothing to write home about!"}
{"text":"Very quaint BYOB, usually always busy during dinner.  Was a bit disappointed during my last visit.  Lasagne was overly salty and the other pasta dish was not warm.  I almost asked for it to be reheated but didn't want to be that person.  Pizzas are excellent and service is always on point."}
{"text":"I love Italian food and Piccolo Forno for their food. The ingredients that this restaurant uses are always fresh. You can't go wrong ever with Piccolo Forno for lunch or dinner.   I highly recommend trying the pizzas. The sauce is just amazing. Probably one of the best sauces on Pizza in Pittsburgh.  They do have great appetizers and pastas and entrees. I've never had a bad meal here.  Great for kids, romantic date nights, groups, and taking your parents out to dinner!  It is BYOB so make sure you bring your alcohol of choice. There is a bar right behind the restaurant called Grapperia and you can buy a bottle of wine there."}
{"text":"Good food! BYOB. Probably won't return here again because as we (party of 5) were finishing the last half of our bottle after dessert,  the host came over & said \"I'm not kicking you out but we have another party waiting for this table so....\"   It was awkward & unprofessional & left us all with a bad taste in our mouth.  No one likes to be rushed out after a nice meal!"}
{"text":"The food at Piccolo Forno is fine, but not spectacular by any stretch. We tried the quattro formaggi and the mortadella e pistachio pizzas, both of which were good but slightly greasy. The biggest problem with the pizza is that is wasn't hot. Oily pizza does not taste right when it is cold. Clearly, the kitchen had management issues. Beyond the pizzas coming out as cold, it took 10 minutes for 3 more of the dishes at the table to come out after the pizzas, and then another 10 minutes for the last dish to come out.   Out of the dishes, I'll note that the tagliatelle con ragu di agnello had such an odd flavor combination that it could not be finished, and the gnocchetti di crescione was bland. Otherwise, we tried a couple of the desserts. Interestingly, the chef adds lemon flavor to the tiramisu. It must turn people off so frequently that the waiter gave us a heads up; why would the chef keep an unusual dish that the waiters need to warn you about it?   Lastly, I'll comment that our waiter, who started off attentive and helpful, was dismissive and bordering on rude by the end of the evening. It was the sort of 180 turn that makes you wonder: Did the chef just chew him out behind the scenes? Did his girlfriend just text him to break up? It was unusual, and there certainly wasn't anything that we could see that accounted for the change."}
{"text":"This place was worth the wait. It took about 45 minutes to get a table which was understandable. (We went on a Saturday.) We grabbed a drink across the street and they called us when our table was ready which First of all, I would prefer rather than waiting around and secondly, there is no where to wait.   All of the staff we spoke to were really friendly and helpful. I debated between two dishes and was glad I let out server help me choose, it was delicious! She highly recommended the Tortelli and we got a meat and cheese plate to start. Everything was filling and so good.   It was BYOB so make sure to take a nice bottle of wine with you.   I will say they cram as many tables in as possible. It is a small place and you don't get much room.  But other than that, this is a new favorite of mine."}
{"text":"My husband and I had are small, intimate wedding at Piccolo Forno in December 2016. Spectacular service. Unbelievable food. Our guests had an incredibly enjoyable experience and were delighted with the food and tiramisu. We adore their staff! They were so accommodating and kind. If you are thinking of having a private event here, we highly recommend!   We have also enjoyed Piccolo Forno for lunch/dinner and have always been pleased with food/service."}
{"text":"I also lucked out and was seated immediately upon my arrival! I didn't realize it was a BYOB place (being new to Pittsburgh, this continues to astound me...). Anyway, it was all good because the waitress told me there is a bar right next door where I could walk over and get a couple of beers and bring them back. When I returned, she poured my first beer in a glass and stuck my second in the refrigerator. I thanked her and said that made the $3.00 corkage fee worthwhile, but she explained there is no corkage for the bar next door sine they own it. So that is great, but if they own the bar, why do I have to walk over and get my own drink? Weird... Anyway, I ordered the Insalata Di Rucola and Speck E Mascarpone pizza. Everything was delicious and the service was excellent. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great BYOB Italian restaurant. Very trendy crowd. Hipster nation. lol. But come early, they don't take reservations. Which is so annoying!  But the food is great. The pasta is home made! Not out of a box."}
{"text":"Went here for a quiet lunch on my birthday and was blown away by the food, staff, and authenticity of the whole restaurant. This will become a nice date night dinner or a place I bring my parents when they come to town!"}
{"text":"I noticed that when you first look at the reviews here you are inundated with positive. I'm writing this because I think that this restaurant is the most overrated place I have ever experienced, and this is mostly due to rave reviews that I read here. I understand that everyone has different tastes, however I disliked certain things here enough that I felt it was only fair that another view point was offered, and I wish that someone had talked me out of trying it.   Our service was fine (not exceptional, but fine - and honestly it seems that good help is hard to come by these days because I always thought that if you work in the service industry you go out of your way to be pleasant and accommodating, however this seems to be an outdated concept now almost everywhere). We arrived before the dinner rush so I have no complaints about a long wait and was surprised how quickly we were seated. I found the restaurant to be beautiful with a nice atmosphere.  I really, really hated the food. So did my boyfriend. This was our first time so we did try a variety of things. Someone did previously mention on here that the lasagna tasted like chef boyardee, BUT to be entirely spot on I have to add that it is chef boyardee with nutmeg. The only reason I could imagine someone liking this is if somehow subconsciously they are comforted and happy because it tastes like childhood. It is not, however, something I would expect to be served in a restaurant. The boyfriend echoes these thoughts, though he was also displeased with the texture.   I was super excited to try the mortadella and pistachio pizza! Now I did not realize that this is not a red sauce-based dish, and so if it does specify that on the menu then that expectation not being met is entirely on me, however I envisioned a regular pizza with bits of meat and pistachio on it. This was a very oily, pistachio-mixed-with-pesto-based pizza with a few chunks of mortadella. It was sweet. (I do not like sweet pizza.) I do happen to like pesto, and occasionally use it as a pasta sauce, however this was so drenched in the stuff that I did not finish a single slice. Boyfriend also ate only one slice, and neither of us could have been bribed into eating more, though I doubt anyone in the history of eating pizza has ever said that after just one piece.   We did order soup, which was decent. We also had the antipasto appetizer, which consists of cured meats, cheeses, pickled vegetables, and toasted bread. This was mostly decent, however I found the meats to be oily and one of the cheese selections was sliced provolone. I was expecting something a bit....more. Personally I think cheese plates should include either very delicious, rare, or unique cheeses, but this had none of those.   2 stars are given for the restaurant itself, being byob, and because there was nothing *wrong* with the service. .5 stars for the food. My overall perception is that people are giving more stars because they think they are *supposed* to like it. If offered the same food in a different environment I would wager we would not see the same reviews. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The main problem with Piccolo Forno is the noise from the harsh acoustics.  It is SO LOUD when the place is full!  Unpleasant!  I was there on a cold Saturday in May at 10pm and the place was packed and very noisy.  (Most Pittsburgh restaurants are quiet or even closed by 10!)  Don't go there when it's busy if you're looking for a calm ambience.  Going at off hours or on a slow weekday or eating at one of their outside tables (if you can get one) would help.  The food: The salads are large, excellent, and beautiful.  The pizzas are very good (though I don't think they're as good as when this place was called Regina Margherita - crust not as good?).  The last time I had tiramisu here it was very good, though not as good as at Lidia's in the Strip.  Service, during this Saturday 10pm visit, was disappointing: waitress took away my fork with my salad plate and I missed my microsecond window to get her attention."}
{"text":"Piccolo is amazing! I love the ambiance, the  service rocks, the food is delicious. My all star list includes- chicken liver pate, bruschetta, the arugula salad, spek and mascarpone pizza, lasagne, and the sage ravioli. But really I've never had anything that I didn't like. The wait is long. The restaurant is busy. I love it! Bring a bottle of wine and enjoy."}
{"text":"This is the only place I have ever eaten in the U.S. where the food actually tastes like it does in Italy. ESPECIALLY if you get anything that's a ragu or bolognese style sauce.  This may be my favorite restaurant in the Burgh. If nothing else, it's at least my favorite Italian restaurant.   I've had half a dozen or so pasta dishes off the menu as well as a handful of their pizzas and appetizers. The only thing I've ever ordered that I was unhappy with was a fairly loaded down pizza that included a fried egg. The center five inches or so of my crust wasn't really done, though under the weight of all those toppings, I understand. Every other pizza I've had has been perfectly made.  The pastas are all from scratch, as are the sauces and they have a depth of flavor that is simply head and shoulders above anything else you will find in Pittsburgh. The atmosphere is lovely, though tightly packed. Get here early on a weekend night for dinner or be prepared to wait an hour or two. (Totally worth it, so head across the street to the Cantina or down a block to the coffee shop while you wait, they'll call your cell when your table is up.)  Extra bonus, this place is BYOB. We love to come here with friends and bring a few bottles of our favorite wines from home. This cuts the cost of a night out dramatically and by bringing a bottle of our favorite wine, you can pretty easily escape this place for around $50-75/couple with salad, entree and a shared dessert. Amazing pricing for the quality of what it is.  Close your eyes and point at the menu and order whatever it lands on. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"good food - reasonable prices - BYOB - our waitress was very knowledgeable of the items on the menu"}
{"text":"Dinner was fabulous!! We went early on a Saturday night around 5, which was the perfect time! They were busy, but there wasn't a wait for a party of 4.  The menu was unique.  The pizza oven is upstairs so you can watch them being prepared.  The kitchen is in the basement so they bring the meals up with a dumbwaiter.  We started with pizza as an appetizer which I recommend for sure!.  We had the featured pizza of provolone, mascarpone, prosciutto and sweet corn--delish.  We also tried the Capricciosa, which was also very good.  Next we had the house salad which had mixed greens, gorgonzola, red onion and tomato with homemade balsamic vinaigrette.  Nothing that out of the ordinary, but good and a nice light course.  I ordered the braised wild boar over fettuccini and it was awesome. It was wild boar braised in a thin red-wine tomato sauce with some carrots, celery and onion then tossed with homemade fettuccini noodles.  I did detect a slight hint of cinnamon or anise maybe?  Something a little different but not off-putting. It was so good, I'd order it again for sure. It was pretty big too.  I took more than half home and had enough for lunch today. My boyfriend had the lasagna he said it was just alright.  It had a lot of layers and he said the pasta was overcooked and a little mushy.        The service was also great, I felt like our server was prompt and professional...but we felt a little rushed...we we were still finishing one course and they were already bringing the next which is an issue only because the tables are so small.    I can't wait to go back!!   I'd definitely recommend.  It would be great for a date night or a girls night out."}
{"text":"I have always wanted to try this place, and let me tell you, it lived up to the hype. We sat outside on a beautiful evening and getting to bring our own bottle of wine was a definite plus. We had the small antipasto plate which was excellent. We also split the Vitello in Bianco pasta, which is seasonal for spring and summer. It was good, except the parsley rigatoni has sort of an odd taste. Would have preferred it with a wheat-based pasta. We also ordered the quattro stagioni pizza that came with mushrooms, artichokes, prosciutto and red peppers. It was excellent. Lots of flavor, and the crust tasted just like a wood-burning pizza should taste like.   We will definitely be coming back, and can't wait to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Amazing as always.  The squid ink spaghetti with shrimp brought back fond memories of Venice.  The pizza we had as an appetizer was thin and delish.  Service was wonderful.  BYOB which is always a plus.  My favorite Italian in Pgh which is saying something.  It's crowded for a reason.  Worth the wait."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 stars for the taste of the food only (not the staff/operations etc.) because the food is really really really good.  And I only had the pizza so I can only imagine what the pasta tastes like, I'm looking forward to going back and finding out!  But a friend that I was with had their pasta and said it was one of the best meals she's had in really long time.    Ok now a separate rating of 0-1 STAR for poor restaurant management.  This place is really popular so expect a wait.  We went on a Saturday night - we must have been masochists b/c we had to wait for an 1 1/2 hours.  But hey I get it and I'm not complaining about the actual wait time.  I will complain about the inability for the restaurant staffers to move/turn tables quicker.  There were so many (not just one or two) but several tables that were done eating but were not budging from their seats.  Dozens of people were waiting to be seated.  And I get the whole lets just sit a bit after our meal, but sitting for longer than 15 minutes when there's a huge wait for other patrons is totally unacceptable and rude.  I feel that it's the restaurants responsibility to politely approach a table that's done with their meal but just lounging around to encourage them to leave.  It's also in the best interest of the restaurant if they're in the business to make money.  Faster tables turned = more groups seated = more $$$$.  Just a friendly, \"Is there anything else you'll need tonight and thanks for coming\", would probably be sufficient to subtly suggest, \"Get the hell out of here\".  But no, the staffers refused to do anything about it, and they were also getting annoyed about the groups that had been sitting for 45 minutes or longer after eating.  But I'm not sure why they refuse to do anything about it.  I feel like if they were to fix this issue, this restaurant would be one of the best in the city.  It's just poor operational managment!  Once we were seated our waitress was very attentive and friendly so I'm not criticizing the service, but the operations of the place."}
{"text":"Some of the best gourmet pizza in the city! Consistently good and great atmosphere. Love it!"}
{"text":"The pizzas here are quite good.  I ordered the prosciutto e funghi pizza, which was very good.  A balanced portion of prosciutto and mushrooms.  The crust was also very tasty.    Service on the other hand was a little too pushy for me and seemed to be rushing my group.  That is just a no-no in my book.  Also, they were SOOOO fake nice, it made my skin crawl.  As in, they were smiling, but they seemed totally annoyed that they had to take our order and bring us our food, aka do their job.  Hence 3 stars instead of four."}
{"text":"Delicious! Started with the meat and cheese tray which was absolutely great. Had the lasagna--noodles just melt in your mouth. Pasta made fresh. We also got the pizza that had 4 different types. The mushroom section was my personal favorite. What makes this place even better is that it's BYOB! You bring it, they cork it for you. If you are in this neighborhood you've got to try it!"}
{"text":"Small, cozy, Italian place that feels classy and relaxed at the same time. The quality is great, with the menu containing some unique ingredients. We started off with the mussels, which were the best I've ever had. We got the smaller size and it was plenty for two of us. They were flavorfully prepared in a way that didn't overwhelm the taste of the mussels themselves. For dinner, I got a gnocchi dish that sounded amazing on paper but which in reality was underwhelming. The gnocchi themselves were good but the other ingredients tasted like they were randomly tossed in. The ingredients were good- just didn't really mesh together. Still giving 4 stars though because based on the mussels and the sounds of the other dishes, I have a feeling the gnocchi was a one-time miss"}
{"text":"Best lasagna EVER.  Period.  And it's BYOB so you don't have to break the bank to drink a great wine with your meal."}
{"text":"Great italian restaurant in lawrenceville! Small dining room and reservations for parties of 6 or more only.  BYOB! Get there early to get your name and number on the list and head to a local bar for a drink before dinner. Round corner cantina is across the street!"}
{"text":"I ate here not too long ago with friends. The wait was an hour and a half on a Saturday night at 7 PM. This was not unexpected but very frustrating since they do not accept reservations for a party of 4 like ours. The decor of the restaurant held nothing special, a bit crowded but still comfortable.  With the wait, we had appetizers elsewhere. For my entree I had the braised boar with vegetables on top of fettuccine. It tasted fairly good but I was expecting more, especially after such a long wait. I was also able to taste the pasta squares in white wine and artichoke duck sauce which I was not particularly fond of. For dessert I split a lemon gelato that was very good. The saving grace of the restaurant for me was that it was BYOB and not terribly pricey.  The bottom line is that I would not pick this as a place to eat again although I would go if others wanted to. The best part of it for me was the gelato and the fact that it is BYOB."}
{"text":"Excellent! I had the spinach ravioli with sage butter sauce and it was incredible! You can't argue with homemade pasta! Just wish I had room for dessert...   Will definitely be back. Looking forward to trying their pizza next time."}
{"text":"Oh yum, yum yum. Tastes just like Italy and the pictures on the walls made me think of  when I lived in Florence. It smells and tastes like the real deal! I would say dress casually, but you can snaz it up a bit without looking like a weirdo and it's BYOB, so we just walked on down to the new wine store on the street and grabbed a bottle. The wait was about 25 minutes and they actually called our name as soon as we walked back up from the wine store. Perfetto!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant experience ... since there were 5 in our party we were able to make a reservation. We were seated right away and the restaurant was busy. It is BYOB and this was evident at nearly every table. Our server was Charly... let me say this.... his upbeat personality, professionalism , knowledge of menu and charm elevated our dining experience . He loves what he does and it's evident, although twice he tried to toss some papers in the trash and twice missed, I guess that's why Pittsburgh  does not have an NBA team.  The pasta with mushrooms was excellent as was the pizza... the lasagna was tasty but did not seem as fresh as the other items.  Great ambiance , reasonable menu pricing and good food makes for a successful evening."}
{"text":"I had to have been here once before but let's say my recent visit was my first (and certainly won't be the last!).  I came with a group of 8, which I believe is the maximum that can be seated at a table and we had a reservation.  Without a reservation I'd be very surprised that you could dine here on a Saturday night.  Every single table was taken and people walking in were told the wait was well over an hour.   Wait staff was great and they went to extra lengths and feats of strength to open our bottle of champagne.  I think they finally ended up opening it by brandishing a sword. Nevertheless, they were up for the challenge and bubblies were all around.  So yes, if you didn't sense from that description, they are BYOB.  And the cork fee is very reasonable. I had a delicious ravioli that left me very full.  Many at my table enjoyed their thin crust pizza, another had lasagna and was quite satisfied.  Prices are really reasonable, service is good, and Piccolo Forno is a great place to go with friends.  Just call ahead!"}
{"text":"Piccolo Forno has been on a long list of restaurants-to-try for a couple years, and I finally came here on Saturday evening with a group of girls. The restaurant did not disappoint!  Our group of 5 arrived at 5pm, but the restaurant already had a 75-90 minute wait. We were told that a table of 4 would only be 40 minutes... However, we had 5 of us, and there was nothing that we could do to change that! Instead, we decided to spend our long wait at the nearby Arsenal (which I highly recommend doing).  I guess there is only one table for 5 at the restaurant... I'm not sure... but when we went back at 6:30, we were told that the table had been occupied for 3 hours. To avoid waiting even longer, we just squished at a little table for 4.   The waitress quickly brought a small basket of bread and butter. It was absolutely delicious! I don't know where their butter is from, but just know that it tasted heavenly. Plus, I loved that the restaurant is BYOB. Some of the girls brought bottles of wine, which were immediately popped open. We were charged only one cork fee of $5 - what a deal!  We shared two appetizers. I am completely blanking on what one of them was... eggplant maybe?... but the second was, I believe, the Affettati, which was a small plate of meats and cheeses. Though the Affettati was tasty, I don't necessarily think that it was worth its $10 price point.  I was torn between the pizza and the pasta, but when I saw some tasty-looking ravioli options, I just had to go with pasta! I settled on the Ravioli con Burro e Salvia (spinach-filled ravioli drizzled with sage butter). It was absolutely incredible. I just recently dined at a highly rated Italian restaurant in the Theater District in New York City, and this pasta absolutely destroyed the three pastas that I tried there.  I can't wait to come back and try some more food. I have a feeling that after trying some more food - and a little less frustration over wait time - I'll be moving this 4 1/2 star review up to 5 stars."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice, but have had pleasant experiences both times.    I have had both the pizza and the pasta and I have to say...I enjoyed the pasta more than the pizza! The pizza is great, but the fresh pasta I had was even better.  I ordered the tagliatelle with mushrooms.  The best part about this dish is how it is unlike anything I've ever ordered.  I find that  when pasta and mushrooms are served a restaurant will cover the dish with some creamy sauce that adds nothing and takes away that great mushroom flavor.  Not here!  The dish didn't really have a sauce-the shrooms were probably cooked in wine, which gave the dish a great taste.  I could have eaten the entire thing if I didn't want to take part of it home and figure out if I could cook something similar myself!  We had the polenta appetizer, which was something great to split for a table of 5.     They have made some changes in the restaurant to deal with the noise, including adding these \"noise shields\" on the ceiling and wall.  It was definitely much quieter my second time there.  I had to take off one star for the same reason as many other reviewers: the front of the house/service.  We had a reservation for 5, and they let us sit down right away even though only 4 of us were there, which is uncommon here.  But, we were told we only had the table for 2 hours.  It would have been 9:30 by the time we left, and this was on a Wednesday night.  I know that some people like to linger in restaurants for all hours, but in a busy place like this I think the diners understand their table is in high demand.  The prices are reasonable, the corkage fee is $5.  Be prepared to wait some time for a table on a Friday or Saturday."}
{"text":"At last, Yelpers! I've finally had the pleasure to experience Piccolo Forno! I should get a badge just for that! ;)   We arrived on a Saturday night and only had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. I was amazed by how awesome the customer service was as the hostess was extremely friendly and offered to hold our wine for us since it's BYOB (My fav! $5/bottle). They call you when you're table is ready.  The place is relatively small, but it gives you a very intimate and cozy feeling. At times it seems a little crazy, but you can still hear the person across from you without having to yell. Tables are far enough away as well so you're not hearing conversation from the couple next to you.   Our server was very polite and made us feel very welcomed. She explained the menu to us and was super cool about everything. She suggested some good items as well.   The food was incredible. We were undecided on what to do for an appetizer and after seeing all of the amazing pizzas come out we went with that. We ordered the Bianca which was just a plain cheese and tomato pizza. I don't know how something that is \"plain\" can taste so good! It literally melted in your mouth! Not something you hear too often about pizza. We devoured it. Next up, I ordered the Rigatoni con Pesto as my entree. Heaven! What I thought was so interesting was the fact that there wasn't too much sauce on the pasta, yet it was so flavorful! A little truly goes a long way here. It was the perfect blend of not too dry and not an overkill with the sauce. The pesto taste wasn't overwhelming either. Bravo!   My only complaint is that the portions (specifically with the entrees) are a little small so I do recommend ordering an appetizer. Four slices of pizza and my meal (... and of course a bottle of wine!!) was plenty to fill me.   I can't wait to return and hopefully bring some new people along with me! I love showing people awesome gems like PN!"}
{"text":"I did not dine in so l will speak solely based on the food alone and not service ... I will however say I do like their set up inside its very nice and intimate ....  I ordered their homemade Lasagna Toscana Traditional layered lasagna with fresh pasta, meat ragu, and beschamel cream sauce which was amazing the serving size was huge and the quality was awesome! I love how they changed it up using  beschamel cream sauce. I also took to go the tiramisu which was very good as well...  Check it out u can also byob"}
{"text":"Amazing. Seriously. I'm currently on a quest to try everything on their menu. The lasagna is life changing (only a slight exaggeration).  Go! Immediately and byob  something you love."}
{"text":"Worth the wait. Good service once your seated and some of the best pizza I have eaten, in any city not just for Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Be prepared for Corkage fees! $13! One pizza was $11 by comparison. Our first time, party of 4, since it's BYOB we brought our favorite beverages: I bottle wine, tiny bottle Prosecco (twist off lid we opened ourself)and a bottle beer. Charged $5 for each \"wine item\" consumed and $3 for the bottle of beer we brought. =$13. Told us the fee was for the \"privilege of bringing drinks\".  If we shared 1 bottle of wine it would be $5. Food was good."}
{"text":"Fabulous homemade pasta, fast service, awesome atmosphere ... nothing not to like! I'll come here all the time for the best byob experience in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Don't let the \"1 hour wait\" scare you away!  Most people give up, as they did the night we went allowing us to sit down in a mere 10 minutes!  Love the location, I think Butler St is where good food happens.  Brought along our own bottle of vino to enjoy some good Italian food.  Seeing that big oven, we knew we had to get a pizza- the Prociutto e Rucola (prociutto and arugula).  It was delicious and we devoured it.  My only qualm is that it was not as THIN as I would have preferred.    Indulging in some pastas, i got the pappardelle with braised rabbit and he the spaghetti with mussels and shrimp (there's a better name for these but I am not Italian enough to write them out).  Everything was tasty, service was quick, we will be back!  Note for the fellas---it's a great date place!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  But a little crowded.  It's BYO, so BYO your best!  This is a great place for a date, it's intimate even when crowded, and the appetizers are delicious.  They also do take out, which is great, and they have some of the best, maybe the best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh.. not to discount the pasta though.  I loved the lamb Mediterranean."}
{"text":"Piccolo Forno is in my shortlist for favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. It's small, intimate atmosphere lacks the pretentiousness that one might expect at first glance, and the prices are very reasonable.  I've tried so many items on the menu and I've never been disappointed. Some of their dishes are almost too rich, but that's less of a complaint and more of an observation, as I've never left without feeling satisfied with my meal! If you want to guarantee yourself a great meal, get the lasagna. You'll be craving it again and again after the first bite. You simply can't beat homemade pastas, either.  Even as I sit here trying to think of one of my less memorable meals, I can't remember one. The pizzas are excellent, the salads are large and good (especially with their simple oil and vinegar dressing), and the appetizers always please the palate.  It's a perfect date night spot, as much as it's a perfect casual place to stop in for lunch or dinner. The wait can be rough during peak times, and reservations are typically only for larger groups (6 or more, if I remember correctly), but it's one of the few restaurants where I'm willing to suffer through a wait.  So, if you're looking for great Italian food, good service, and a nice BYOB place, be sure to make Piccolo Forno a priority!"}
{"text":"yup as good as it gets. Not from Pittsburgh so was looking for a fun place for dinner this fit the bill.  Amazing food and staff.  Brought our own wine and had a fabulous evening.  On the way home had an opportunity to talk to a few locals as soon as we mentioned Piccolo Forno the response was always overwhelmingly positive. Most said that is their FAVORITE Italian place in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Ahh, Piccolo Forno. Thou patriarch of old. Thou partial establisher of Pittsburgh's restaurant scene. At last I eat of thy wonders and partake of thy morsels. I am honored to dwell within thy walls and eat from thy table. It has been the desire of mine heart for many lengths of time.   It was actually pizza.   CAPRICCIOSA: Crushed tomato, fresh mozzarella, mushroom, artichoke, olive, prosciutto cotto and egg.   And  QUATTRO FORMAGGI:  White pizza topped with fresh mozzarella, gorgonzola, crotonese, and ricotta cheeses (no sauce).   I couldn't get enough. Best pizza I'd had for A While. The cheeses were AMAZING. So was the crust. And every other ingredient.   I had high expectations for Piccolo Forno and they were definitely met. But I would hate to detract from such a fine dining experience with an excessively wordy review."}
{"text":"Hey.   Ok.  The restaurant that started the lawrencevile revival.  It's all about integrity and innovation and expertise.  They bring it all together here.  My advice come hungry with your best bottle of heavy Cabernet (that's what I like).  Something red unless it's a fantastic white.  And do a three courser.   App.  Mini flatbread pizza and main dish.  You CANT go wrong when it's this right."}
{"text":"Delicious. We went for lunch on a weekday so it wasn't crowded. We ordered a pizza with speck and mascarpone, and lasagna bolognese. The pizza was really tasty; the crust was thin, crispy, and chewy with good flavor, the toppings were good quality, and the sauce was really nice with a fresh tomato flavor. (In fact, it inspired me to change my own pizza sauce recipe at home!) The lasagna was amazing. The layers of fresh noodles were perfectly tender and the meat and sauces had excellent flavor. I really look forward to going back and trying out more items."}
{"text":"there's a reason it is always so crowded, it's just that good. make a reservation or expect to wait.  byob and very affordable, there isn't a better option for gourmet Italian in PIttsburgh."}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely tasty and rich, from soup to dessert.  Definitely not a same-old pasta factory."}
{"text":"So I liked Piccolo Forno.  I really did.  Very tasty.  But I haven't quite figured out why people are willing to wait 90 minutes for it.  Puzzling mystery.  We knew this would happen, so we put our names in around 630 pm on a Saturday, and got seated about 8 pm.  Fortunately we had enjoyed several cocktails at Eclipse Lounge down the street in the meantime, so we were in very good spirits.  Also, the hosts take your cell phone number, and even gave us a courtesy call when the party whose table we were going to take was \"eating dessert,\" so we knew we had about 15 minutes left to wait and had time to finish our cocktails without needed to chug them and run out the door.  Piccolo Forno is small and bustling.  People gather to wait in the front, so it can be a little crowded getting in the door.  Once seated though, we all felt relaxed and happy.  We opened a few bottles of wine ($5 each corkage), and I have to say much as I love BYOB, I hate this corkage fee thing.  Ugh.  Maybe I'm just spoiled, but in other cities where I've lived, BYOB = no charge.  So, I got a house salad which was a nice, simple starter, and then at the server's recommendation, I ordered the Stracotto di Cingiale con Fettucine.  That would be braised boar with vegetables over fettucine pasta.  It was quite yummy.  Obviously fresh pasta, tender meat, and a reasonably generous portion for not much money.  The boar was seasoned in an interesting way, almost a bit sweet - sugar?  cinnamon?  not sure.  But tasty.  Couldn't finish it so it went in a box, and I look forward to consuming the rest of it shortly, probably tonight.  Gratuity was included since we had a party of 7 - two girls split the check, and then we gave them cash.  But I've since heard from the two girls that the restaurant overcharged them - randomly adding $15 more to each check, even though gratuity was already included (clearly stated on the receipt) and we can't figure out why they did that.  They're planning to call and get that figured out, but it put a bit of a damper on our impressions of the evening.  So it's a tasty place with good, fresh food.  But to be truly honest, when you have to wait 90 minutes and pay to BYOB, and the check gets messed up, it isn't exactly a perfect evening out.  So if you don't mind waiting and paying to bring wine, I'd say go for it.  But the food didn't knock my socks off enough to make up for the logistical annoyances.  If I'm waiting and paying for my own wine, I'd like the food to be outstanding.  And we aren't quite there, in my opinion."}
{"text":"The food is very bland and unremarkable. Very nice interior, a cozy and attractive place to eat. However, besides the bruschetta, nothing noteworthy about the food. Add some salt or different spices."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night. I had the salmon ravioli. I ate half and didn't want the rest to take home. Good but not great and I still tasted it this morning.. My wife had the lasagna which was awesome and huge! Really it's big enough for 2. The waitress forgot to bring back the leftover lasagna to take home. We also shared the baked meatballs with a pesto sauce. It wasn't what I was expecting as far as meatballs but it was really good. Overall nice  dinner and everything was made fresh. So 4 stars for now. Next time I'll try another dish"}
{"text":"While I cannot comment on the food, I must say that I have never been so insulted by an establishment in my entire life.    I was extremely excited to go to Piccolo Forno for my birthday as I have had my eye on it for several years, but just haven't seemed to be able to find the opportunity.  I will admit that the decision was made a bit last minute, so I wasn't surprised when they said that they were booked for reservations.  They did say that I could come in and put my name down on the list and wait, so I opted to do that and head over to Round Corner Cantina for a couple drinks and appetizers.  When I first arrived at 7:15, they had previously estimated that the wait would be about 2 hours, and I appreciated it when they gave me a call at around 9pm to let me know it would be another 45 minutes and to find out if I still wanted to wait.  I told them very clearly that I would still like to wait, as my party seemed relatively content at the time.  About an hour later, when we went over to check to see how much longer it would be, the hostess informed us that someone had called and said to cancel the reservation sometime after they had called me to confirm I would still like to wait.  Huh?  I told the hostess that there was no way this had happened as everyone in my party was still waiting.  She flatly told me that there was nothing they could do and that the reservation had been canceled.  One of the other hostesses started looking around the restaurant, trying to figure out if there was any way to fit my group in, but the original hostess shot her down and said there was no way we could possibly get seated (it was already past 10pm by this time).  There was no apology or anything, and I left extremely upset.    I am not certain if it was another patron looking to get a seat sooner that called, or if one of the employees was looking to get home earlier and didn't want to deal with a group of 8 at a relatively late hour.  Regardless, I was extremely insulted that they did nothing to try to remedy the fact that we had been waiting for a table for over 3 hours.  We ended up having to go to a bar in order to get food since it was already too late for most restaurants, and it pretty much ruined everybody's night since we all were so hungry and grumpy.  While I was looking extremely forward to trying Piccolo Forno since I had heard so many great things about their food, I will never patronize the restaurant due to the rude and insulting customer service."}
{"text":"Delicious! My boyfriend and I have gone here several times & are never disappointed! I stick to the pizzas simply because I don't like to try new things. However, he orders something different each time and has never been let down. The one thing I will say is the service isn't the greatest. The waitress' always seems to be hanging around instead of taking care of you but the good food makes up for it. That's why I am giving 4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing Italian food that tastes like... Italian food. Not \"American-Italian\". I have never had a bad meal. Favorites are any of the salads, the lasagne, the rabbit pasta and all of the appetizers. The outdoor streetside seating in the summer is pretty good too. Best of all, it's BYO."}
{"text":"SETTING: Simple and intimate ambiance with a warm and inviting atmosphere. I really like the dark red tones, brick walls, and hardwood floors.   FOOD: Garfield would love this place because Piccolo Forno does lasagna like no other. I love lasagna and have had a wide spectrum of quality. I've had frozen dinner lasagna (regretfully), Olive Garden lasagna (pretty okay), and also lasagna from other nice Italian restaurants (not bad). BUT, Piccolo Forno's lasagna (have mercy!) is the clear winner here.   What makes this lasagana so incredible? No question, it's the beschamel cream sauce instead of the heavy ricotta cheese. The lasagna just melts in your mouth! Furthermore, the size of the dish is generous. It's always a struggle deciding if I should take the rest home and enjoy it for another meal, or enjoy it longer and finish the dish!   SERVICE:  Professional. However, PF always gets very busy, so sometimes it does get a bit difficult to flag down staff.  IMPRESSIONS:  I've had lasagna here for a few times, and I could never order anything else. That's how good it is. I just can't muster up the courage to try something new when I already know the lasagna is heavenly!"}
{"text":"I am thrilled to update my previous review with a more positive experience.  My friends and I made another attempt at Piccolo Forno and after an hour wait, we finally made it in.  Was the wait worth it?  Yes, but I was getting hangry...  As we snacked on our appetizers - Bruchetta and Affettati - my hangry side subsided and I was able to savor the delicious cured meats and creamy cheeses.  Okay maybe I'll give this place a fair shot.  Then our entrees arrived - Prosciutto e Funghi, Tortelli, Cavatelli con Salsiccia e Rapini, and my selection Agnolotti di Piselli - sweet pea filled agnolotti with pancetta and wild mushrooms.  TASTE EXPLOSION!  The bright green sweet pea filled agnolotti were the perfect complement to the savory mushrooms.  The crispy panchetta provided the textural and salty flavor needed to complete the dish.  Did I lick the plate?  No, but I was close.  Dessert?  Well sure, why not?  When in Rome... House made Tiramisu and other sorbetto arrived at our table... but didn't stay on the plate for long.  A perfect ending to a perfect meal.  My only complaint is the wait time.  In most restaurants, hanging around after the bill is brought is fine.  However when people hanging out, not ordering additional items, and sipping on their BYOB - these patrons are costing you business.  There either need to be more tables or an increased sense of urgency to move tables.  We were told a 30 minute wait.  It turned out to be an hour because our 4 top table was taken by 2 diners who decided to chat for 30 minutes after their meal.  Yes it's a causal and intimate atmosphere, but these customers are costing you money.   The only thing preventing me from awarding Piccolo Forno from the coveted 5 stars is the wait time.  By the way - this is a BYOB establishment."}
{"text":"I just love Piccolo Forno so much, it warms my soul.   I've been here quite a few times over the years and have never had a bad experience whether it was just 2 people or large groups.  Yes there will be a wait, yes it will be long on weekends, but that is why you have 2+ great pre-dinner drinks options across the street and around the corner.  Just be prepared for the wait, get a drink at Cantina, take a deep breath it will all be ok and you will soon be drunk off a margarita and in lasagna heaven.  The food.  I always start with a Pizza.  The pizza is the best authentic Italian style in the city.  My mother lived in Italy for years and I've been a few times and this is the closest I have had to the streets of Italy.  My favorites: Prosciutto E Rucola or the Speck E Marscarpone.  Prosciutto and arugla is my life go to pizza, but the Speck and Marscarpone is a unique change.  Sweet from the cheese, salty from the speck, my mouth is watering.    Pasta.  Oh sweet homemade pasta.  I've had the rotolo which is very good.  The spinach ravioli with sage is also good.  Tortelli is good, but not my favorite.  Where my heart starts to race with excitement is the lasagna.  Many have said it before, but this lasagna is just IT.  Sidenote, I would like them to bring back the maccheroni with eggplant.  That was always my dining partners choice for ideal sharing.  Regardless of your party size, what people are ordering, one person must get the lasagna."}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food in Lawrenceville. Street parking. Not a very big place so I recommend a reservation if possible. We came early at about 4pm on a Saturday so we were seated right away. Our server was polite and friendly. Prices were pretty reasonable and I think our total bill for four people was about $75 not including tip.   The Fagioli, Tonno E Cipolle salad was full of flavor and he perfect balance of lettuce to toppings in my opinion. This was large enough to share with my husband. I then had the margherita pizza which was also full of flavor. Pizza was 8 slices I think and enough for two people to share or to have left overs!   Will definitely be back and can't wait!"}
{"text":"Nice.  Food was fantastic, and the place itself, it very cool."}
{"text":"We went to Piccolo for our friend's bachelorette party- they reserved us a table in the back  (so it was pretty private) and we had the most amazing time roasting our bride to be!    I ordered the butternut squash ravioli and my only real regret was not being closer to the other bridesmaids so I could steal their food. I definitely want to take my husband or family back so I can try more of their specialties.    Combine that with their BYOB policy and the price is right- a cheap date night!!"}
{"text":"I had the best panini of my life at this place! The wood burning oven that toasted it must have made all of the difference. BYOB is always a plus, as you can roll in with your own bottle of red to share for a romantic weekend lunch/dinner and leave with an affordably delicious bill and beyond satisfied appetite."}
{"text":"Rustic Italian food at its very best!   There is a very good reason Piccolo Forno remains a regular in Pittsburgh's Best Restaurant list.    The food was simple yet incredibly flavorsome! To start, we ordered three appetizers to share. The best was the Polpete Toscane (three baked beef/pork meatballs with a fresh herb green sauce). The fresh sauce helped cut through the richness of the meatballs which simply dissolved in your mouth. We then ordered mains and I selected the Agnolotti di Piselli pasta. It was absolutely delicious!! The sweet pea filling in the angnolotti was contrasted cleverly with salty pancetta and woody earthiness of wild mushrooms. It was a remarkable combination that I did not expect. We circled our mains around the table and everything was really enjoyable. Of mention is that they make both their  pasta and pizza dough in-house and, boy, does it make a difference! We ended the meal with Tiramasu and Lemoncello Gelato e Sorbetto. The Tiramisu had the surprising but delicious inclusion of orange liquor. We devoured it within seconds! It is a definite must if you still have the tiniest modicum of room left. Finally, the feast was ended with the Limoncello gelato which was a perfect cleansing finish to a very decadent meal.  We made reservations for 5 at 6.30 pm but arrived a little sporadically as it coincided with the middle of a torrential downpour. They were kind enough to alter their policy and seat us as we arrived. Our waitress was very attentive and had a great grasp of the menu as she had tried nearly every dish on the menu (speaks for itself!).   We all thoroughly enjoyed Piccolo Forno and departed with content bellies. I can't wait to come back and make my through the rest of this incredible menu!   Overview: Appetizers -- Crostini di Polenta, Polpete Toscane, Affettati Salad -- Fagioli Tonno e Cipolle salad, Antipasto di Mare salad Mains -- Prosciutto e Funghi pizza, Lasagna Toscana, Spaghetti di Casa con Gamberi e Cozze pasta, Rotolo Trecolori pasta,  Agnolotti di Piselli pasta Dessert -- Tiramisu, Limoncello Gelato e Sorbetto Drinks -- BYOB, $5 corkage per bottle   Bookings -- 5 or more, all must be present before being seated Price -- Great value for quality and portions. Pasta $15-19, Pizza $11-15 , Salad $ 8-11 Service -- exceptionally attentive and very helpful"}
{"text":"The space is very quaint (translated small) with exposed brick walls.  Menu options include pizza, salads, panini sandwiches, and pasta.  Note, no alcohol on the menu but I've read in other reviews that it's a BYOB kinda place.  I ordered the Margherita pizza (tomatoes and mozzarella) while my husband ordered the Piccante pizza (sausage and hot peppers).  While I appreciate the wood-fired oven thin crust, I must take issue with the Margherita pizza. Yes, it advertised crushed tomatoes.  I guess my brain didn't translate what that meant, though -- basically, a cheese pizza.  Oh, and basil? That, you had to order as an extra for $1.00.  Am I not correct that by definition the Margherita pizza comes with basil???  Add injury to insult, there was about one sprig of basil per slice.  Personally, I want my Margeherita pizza to come with sliced tomatoes and more basil (included in the base offerings). So, hmmfph.  Also, as a side note, I needed to ask if they took reservations for a future engagement.  Per the server, they do for parties from 5 to 8 people.  It's a small venue so fair enough.  Will I be back?  Maybe, but I'll definitely try something other than pizza."}
{"text":"Sometimes Pittsburgh feels like a food/cultural wasteland to me, and then I find places like this. I've recently been trying to explore the local Lawrenceville eateries and get out of the same old Oakland/Shadyside/Sq. Hill venues and it's definitely been a good thing. This is by far the best Italian food I've had in the burgh. In fact, I went to Joe Mama's for late night a few days after eating here and everything just paled/felt lame in comparison. Piccolo is first of all, one of the cleanest restaurants I've been in in the city. Second of all, it's relatively priced ($11-$15 for pasta entrees, $11-$13 for pizza), and third of all, the pasta is amazing! At least the dish that I had was. I'm still having dreams about it. I forget the name but it's basically a cheese gruyere pasta with the softest meltiest eggplant at the bottom. Never enjoyed something entirely vegetarian so much. I also loved the small, cozy and intimate atmosphere (okay it would have been intimate sans the drunk part of 8 right behind us. this definitely seems more like a date place than a group of friends, and on that note, it is also byob). Tucked away in that busy little building with people eating outside, it felt almost reminiscent of eating at a local east village restaurant.  Also, while you're waiting for a table be sure to check out the numerous boutiques down the street such as the newly opened PageBoy salon/store."}
{"text":"We were finally able to eat here, but went for lunch. The last three times we tried to go for dinner the wait was 1.5 hours. It is a small quaint restaurant. The server was attentive and efficient. We ordered a pepperoni pizza, it was actually a cheese pizza and we added the pepperoni, can't remember the name. The pizza was very good, probably the best we've ever had. We split the lasagna, the portion size was big. It was good, really enjoyed the homemade noodles. However, the downfall was the nutmeg spice that was added to it. You could smell cinnamon as soon as it was delivered to the table. It was also cold in the middle. It looked hot when it arrived, you cold see steam, when you bit into it, it was cold. Most likely reheated. Overall, we enjoyed our visit. We will be back, glad we didn't wait for dinner, the menu is exactly the same for lunch."}
{"text":"Bonkers amazing for the price point. We usually like to come here for lunch on the weekends - as early as possible, because it gets rather hectic. I haven't ever tried to beat the dinner crowds, because I've heard it's so hard to get a table here in the evenings.  We usually like to get an appetizer, a pizza, and a salad to share - never lets us down, although I will say that their pappardelle and coniglio (rabbit) dish is also amazing. We've had most of the things on the menu, and I can honestly say that nothing has ever let us down. We like the funghi and prosciutto pizza the best, although the one with arugula is crazy delicious as well.  We haven't ever had bad service here in the many, many times we've visited, and I think it's because we are visiting at less busy times. This would definitely be a difficult place to bring a large party to, unless you had worked out reservations well in advance.  Love it. Will be back. Often. Hope you enjoy it too... but not too much, because then it would be hard for us to get in!  Ah, I almost forgot - parking sucks if you can't get into their small lot across the street from Round Corner Cafe. Be willing to hoof it a bit, but it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"We ate there on Saturday night 9-6 with another couple.  Service was terrific - kudos to Charlie!  My wife and I had the pasta fagioli soup to start, which was awesome.  She had the spinach ravioli and I had the eggplant \"mac & cheese,\" which were both prepared perfectly.  We finished by splitting the terrific tirmasu.  And we got out of there for $60 before the tip.  We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"AMAZING food. Please expand so that the wait time every time I go isn't 1hr+!"}
{"text":"I was recommended by a friend to try out Piccolo Forno. Although she gave very nice reviews about the place, it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. Their pizza, on-point. We ordered the four cheese pizza and I enjoyed every single moment of it. Their pasta and lasagna? Not so much. I could taste the tomato paste very strongly and it was a bit liquidy too. I really like Italian food and I love every pasta, but this one did not cut it for me.  What got me angry at Piccolo was the customer service. I felt mistreated and some what looked down upon. Our waitress was very straightforward and even a little rude. You would think that at a nice place like Piccolo, they would train their waitresses better.   I don't know if I'll be going back any time soon, but maybe I will once I start craving good pizza."}
{"text":"Two thumbs up for the food (the beef and pork tortelli is awesome and the tiramisu was gigantic...even for two people, but the polenta crostini was a little dry) and the BYOB! I wish they would reserve a few tables each night. The wait can be maddening. Therefore, I HIGHLY recommend that you go early."}
{"text":"First off, we waited 90 minutes for a table for two. The wait wasn't too bad because we walked around Lawrenceville, and the hostess gave us a call when the table was ready. Also, Piccolo is has an accommodating BYOB policy and will keep your wine in a stool while you wait.  Food wise, we started with liver patee. It was served with peas and pickled red onions. I think the items complimented each other well. (This appetizer was reminiscent of ones I am accustomed to having during Russian dinners). For the main course, we split a brick oven pizza with prosciutto and mushrooms. The ingredients were fresh, the cheese was pure, and the prosciutto was served cold (as it should be). My only complaint was that the pizza wasn't as crispy or charcoaled as I like.  Lastly, the restaurant was dimly lit giving it an intimate ambiance. I liked how the kitchen was open and you could see the chefs cooking the food."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my dinner here last Friday night. I chose the restaurant due to its Yelp reviews and it's proximity to the hospice facility I'd spent day and night at for the precious few days. I'm not much of a drinker but I wanted a glass of wine, a decent meal, and a bit of fresh air. I got pretty much all of that here.   For wine...it's BYOB. If you're not from the area, that's a bit of a challenge. There is a wine bar next door, Grapperia, at which you can purchase a bottle and Piccolo Forno won't charge their corkage fee.   The restaurant was crowded with young families (with young children), 20-30s aged groups, older couples, and a large wedding/rehearsal dinner group. Even though it was not yet 6 pm, there was an hour wait for an indoor table when we arrived, so we chose to be seated outside (immediate seating at that moment but it filled within 5 minutes of our being seated).  The menu is limited, with some fairly heavy pastas, but they seem to make well the small number of items offered. Everything was fresh and delicious. The burrata with seasonal tomatoes was delicious: bright tomatoes and a creamy fresh burrata, which was heavenly with their focaccia (served on request, with butter). The tagliatelle with mushrooms was surprisingly toothsome, with fresh (housemade) tomato pasta. The pizzas are definitely popular here, so we ordered a margherita with pancetta added. The crust was nicely crisp and golden, with a chewy quality, and both the pancetta (not too salty, with an interesting smokiness to its flavor) and the mozzarella were good. It was more food than two people could consume, but they packaged the leftover pasta and pizza for us, thoughtfully adding in plastic cutlery and our leftover focaccia.  There was some trouble with people driving by and yelling obscenities about \"yuppies\" and an unstable man stopping at our table and accosting us verbally (yelling that we would never be truly \"rich\" like he was and trying to get us to give him our wine). It made us a bit uncomfortable, but this wasn't the fault of the restaurant or its staff.  It just let us know the neighborhood has probably been through some changes recently, possibly displacing people. My daughter and I needed a place to take a break from the sadness of our vigil at hospice, and Piccolo Forno provided that."}
{"text":"This restaurant is usually busy on weekends and even most weeknight dinners and for good reason. The wood fire pizza is great. I've always had good service as well. The negatives are not the fault of the staff but of the owners I presume. The \"no substitutions\" is really off-putting for me. I don't eat any kind of sausage and some form of sausage is on most pizzas. They will take it off but refuse to replace it with mushrooms or any other type of product. I understand you think your recipes taste the best but you run a restaurant and need to take into account the dietary needs of others. I also disagree with reservations for 5 people or more. Either take reservations or don't. My husband and I shouldn't have an hour wait because 3 parties of 6 made reservations and can walk right in."}
{"text":"BYOB with gourmet food at a remarkable price. The service is consistently perfect, as is the housemade pasta."}
{"text":"Amazing - great atmosphere and food. Love the BYOB. The food is well done. Their staff could be a little nicer. Sometimes when we call to ask about how long the wait is they aren't always nice over the phone. Happy with the food though."}
{"text":"Never ever ever will this restaurant disappoint. I continue to come back here time and time again. It is always my first thought when I have friends or family coming into town. Ambience is warm and lively; food is always cooked to perfection; staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the menu; and best of all, it's BYOB. Best quality food at affordable prices. Don't forget to stop in for a drink at their Grapperia bar located behind Piccolo. Their bartenders serve up some of the best drinks in the city limits. You'll find some unique cocktails made with balsamic vinegar or lavender, to name a few; great craft beer; and of course an extensive wine list. Perfect spot for a date or dinner with a group of ten. If you live in Pittsburgh and haven't been here yet, what are you waiting for!?"}
{"text":"Excellent!!! Always a great meal!!!  We have family that visits from Columbus Ohio just to eat hear."}
{"text":"Overall I didn't like the experience that much. The bruschetta appetizer was very good, the best part of the meal. I got saussage and fennel pizza which the taste was ok ok. We got tiramisu for dessert which wasn't very authentic. They added lemon to the cream or something like that.  The waitress was kinda all over the place as well. She forgot plates at the beginning and then brought my food 10 minute before my friend's so mine was just sitting there getting cold."}
{"text":"As an Argentinean guy, used to eat very good Italian food I have to say they do an outstanding job. The food is creative and yet traditional! We had an amazing dinner there and it wasn't expensive at all!"}
{"text":"The only way I have been able to describe my dinner from tonight is the best Italian meal I have ever eaten out.  It was simply amazing.  Honestly, I ordered based off of one of the pictures that was posted on Yelp.  I was so entertained by the look and presentation of the Rotolo Trecolori that I forced myself to order it, and I am so happy that I did.  The crepe that the spinach, shredded carrots, and red peppers were wrapped in was perfectly light.  The combination of flavors and the addition of the delectable gruyere cheese sauce were what made this plate so memorable.  I cannot wait to come back here.  It is going to be hard to not order this plate again!"}
{"text":"Simply put, this is one of Pittsburgh's BEST restaurants. No questions asked. Unlike many \"Italian\" (yes, in quotations) restaurants that serve Italian-American, Piccolo Forno serves the real deal - Italian food straight from the mountains of Tuscany.  Everything is homemade here - from the pasta and soups to the pizza. And you honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I always really look forward to having a meal here, whether its a casual \"stop in\" lunch with some friends or a more formal night out with my wife.  The food is great, and the service is top notch. This, without question, is one of Pittsburgh's true gems when it comes to authentic Italian food."}
{"text":"We ended up here by chance... Just walked down to Butler Street without definite plans.  Round Corner was packed, so we decided to see about the wait here.  It was 9pm on a Saturday night.  The hostess told us it was only 10 mins, so we decided to stay.  It was a warm night, so we opted for the outdoor seating.  My boyfriend and I decided to split a caprese salad and pizza.  Every smell coming from the other tables was so amazing, I couldn't wait for our food to come.  We were not disappointed!  The salad was fresh and yummy, and ohhhh my was the pizza good.  We couldn't help but polish off every last slice!  My only regret was not bringing a bottle of wine since it is BYOB.  Next time (and there will be many \"next times\") we will be better prepared.  HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"BYOB, tasty Italian dishes, wood fired thin crust pizza......all those make me happy and the way they are done at Piccolo Forno makes me a very happy girl! The atmosphere in there makes me feel very cozy and comfy  with all the exposed brick, open kitchen & watching all those pretty luscious smelling pizzas come whizzing by is pretty fun, too.   Knowing there is a possibility of a wait, we've always hit Piccolo Forno a bit early and gotten seated immediately. Hope I haven't just sabotaged myself!  I learned in Italy that I should always order the spaghetti with shrimp and mussels (in Italy I got clams, too). I was definitely not disappointed doing this here! Although you may have to treat your shirt for red sauce stains, but if you brought red wine you might have that even if you ordered white sauce.  On another occasion we've also split the fennel salad (very tasty) and the Quattro Stagioni pizza with 4 separate ingredient sections with artichokes (also an Italian staple, yum!), prosciutto, mushrooms and roasted red peppers. This pizza was amazing. We ordered this same pizza at Pi Coal Fired and  Piccolo Forno blew it away!  We're looking forward to working our way through the rest of the menu here - with a great bottle of wine of course!"}
{"text":"This is italian cuisine executed to perfection. Definitely the best if not top 3 BYOB's in Pittsburgh area. Although I have only dined here once, I always find myself wanting to return and try other menu items!"}
{"text":"I think I'd actually give this a 3.5 if I could.....So I really enjoyed my dinner at Piccolo Forno. Our server Sofia was wonderful, some of the best service I've had in a while. My boyfriend who drinks like a camel was never left with an empty glass or even a half empty glass for that matter. But, I think I was expecting like the most amazing meal I've ever had in my life. My expectations may have been too high.  We came in a little after 5 on a Friday night. Piccolo has been high on our list to try and we were already in Lawrenceville so I said let's just go now. We'll never not have to wait again. So in we went.   I know that this place was on the top 25 restaurants in the city so that probably made more people travel to Lawrenceville than normally would have seen this little gem. But the table decked out in full fur coats that had a member who couldn't get off the phone to eat his meal was a little absurd to me. This place serves pizza paninis and some pasta. It's BYOB. Showing off your \"wealth\" and important status made me laugh.   We ordered a Margherita Pizza as well as the Salmon Ravioli. The pizza came out super fast. It was great, I really enjoyed it and would love to try one with some toppings next time. I wasn't a big fan of the ravioli. Had I searched the yelp reviews for salmon I probably would have swayed away from this decision. The salmon seemed smoked, which I'm not a big fan of and I think if I'd seen it on the menu I would have stayed away. The salmon taste was overpowering.   So next time I'd bring some wine (which we didn't have) and order a few pizzas to try out different types.  Also, to the gruff server standing behind my boyfriend who upon seeing him stand up to go to the bathroom harshly said, \"what do you want\".... that's probably not the best way to greet someone. Just saying..."}
{"text":"A lower Lawrenceville staple in my book, serving up delicious Tuscan-style thin crust brick oven pizza and various other dishes like soups, salads, and pasta.  But, more often than anything, I come here for their pizza.  For this style of pizza, Piccolo Forno makes some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh, second only to Il Pizzaiolo's (among the places I've tried).  Because I live a few blocks away, most of my experiences here have been stopping in for a quick soup or panini during an off-hours late lunch or getting takeout pizza.  The food is consistently delicious, and I have tried a lot of the menu.  My favorite items are the Torre di Melanzane (eggplant/tomato/mozzarella appetizer), the Salciccia e Cipolle (sausage pizza), and the lasagna.  I've enjoyed several of their soups, including an amazing butternut squash, and paninis for lunch.  When it isn't crowded or busy, the service is absolutely satisfactory.  But yes -- it does get VERY crowded sometimes, particularly Friday and Saturday nights, and any night there is a big event going on in Lawrenceville.  On very busy nights, it is PACKED, and you may have to wait up to 1-2 hours for a table, depending on the size of your party.  They don't take reservations for tables under 5, so if you are planning to dine here on a Friday or Saturday night, plan to arrive much earlier than when you expect to eat.  They will call you when your table is about to be ready, so you can spend the waiting time browsing the many cute shops nearby or grabbing a cappuccino at Espresso a Mano.  Many of the negative reviews here seem to have been affected by the long wait and crowdedness/popularity of the restaurant.  Is the food worth the wait?  It's hard to say.  My advice is to either avoid trying to dine in during peak hours on Thurs, Fri, and Sat nights, or plan for the wait and do something fun in the neighborhood, or get takeout.  You won't be disappointed by the food!"}
{"text":"The entrees and pizzas that I've tried have been exactly the best food I have ever had.   More than one slot in the best ever. #1 and #2 and #3 - all here. All at this one establishment.  I don't particularly like Italian food.   They take an old, \"Oh, I've heard that one enough times,\" type of cuisine and turn it into a sparkling, elegant, and majestic novelty. It's not a twist - it's a new implementation entirely. The baking and cooking of the carbs and meats turns the breads, pizza, rotollo trecolori pastry element, lamb, speck into an odyssey of texture.   So: get as much food here as you can.  I've never been more pleased to interact with a piece of inanimate material than the first time I ordered here, four years ago. I don't like things, high-end physical things - I prefer consumables.   I don't really like consumables either, but the really good ones get me sometimes.  This place gets me every time. Gets me happy. I do not regret a single unit of currency spent here.  I think the atmosphere is ideal. It's warmly lit, all light-toned hardwoods, with a big brick furnace in the center for baking in and an exposed kitchen. The bathrooms are ravishing. The tabletops are clean and comfortable.   p.s. BYOB. Wine place around the corner sells phenomenal wines, and wines and spirits is only a ten minute round trip walk, so if you are with somebody who isn't afraid of a short jaunt pre-dinner date, that works well too.  p.p.s food : Rotollo trecolori - the texture of the softest pasty you've ever had, and yet totally vegetarian. Made of blended roasted peppers, spinach, and carrots whipped up and packed tightly into the lightest, puffiest, yet still barely cohesive pastry shell. The sweetness of the carrots, the softness of the roasted red peppers, and the bite and warmth of the spinach each adding something different to their respective pastry shells, creating a series of three cloud-like pastry veggie objects with a progressive nature. The sauce it comes in - very warm, warm viscous green. Adds a slight brocolli warmth to each bite, and a bit of butter. Amazing.   Pizza with marscapone or ricotta on their sublimely dry sauce on their pizza with speck - soft, then the speck a slight bit chewy, then the slight crispiness on the edge of their overall soft pizza creating a kind of looping event out of each bite, an excellent experience, all flavors a soft savory, the mouthfeel being unbelievably in control. Amazing.  Appetizer, meatballs of some kind - comes with a pesto. This pesto is very light on the nuts, and it creates something that allows a sense of cleanliness in this sauce that is warmed overall by the meatballs themselves. Top quality, new, inventive - like a high-end appetizer should be, but so often fails to be. Amazing."}
{"text":"Here's my tl;dr for this place  Great sandwiches and coffee Some of the pizzas are questionable, some are very good  Pasta is good but isn't great Long wait times for dinner almost always"}
{"text":"The other reviews tell it best, the food and atmosphere are electric. What's more is the story behind the restaurant...the owner was only 22 when he opened. In a time when it's so difficult to run a business, these guys manage to constantly re-invent the menu and continue to be a catalyst for the Lawrenceville neighborhood business community."}
{"text":"I have worked a block away from Piccolo Forno for 7 1/2 years and never thought of stopping in until today...on my lunch break.   Whenever I ride past Piccolo Forno in the evenings, they are usually brimful to the point where the restaurant's well-heeled clientry are well-nigh spilling out onto the sidewalk as they dine, and that's when they're not peevishly running in front of your car without looking both ways to get inside the place. Combine that with my rock-and-roll hours, and getting a table at PF hasn't exactly been convenient for me. Geniunely, my long-time nearness to PF and its perpetually bustling nature after dark has often caused me to forget its existence. At best, it had over time plainly become \"that Italian place down the street I never get to go to,\" much like the defunct Tambellini's of my native Brookline used to be; I've passed it a trillion times, but I have no chance of eating there.   Last night, I got the crazy idea to try PF for *gulp* take-out. After all, it said here on Yelp that they offered it. So I checked out the online menu. Pasta would be too much hassle. Pizza would take too long.   A-ha! They offer panini! It's a sandwich. I might be able to manage that sans employment suicide,\" I said to myself.   \"Besides, they never appear to be busy during daylight. This may work.\"  As 4PM approached, my back tingled, my stomach gnarled, my hands were washed of grime, and I marched over to Piccolo Forno.   The tales of snobbery, rushed service, and counterfeit cordiality have been burned from my mind for as soon as I entered (infiltrated?) the establishment, I was greeted by a twentysomething kid with curly hair, a downy moustache, and a white t-shirt. Behind him was a brick oven that contained smoldering orange coals and resembled the face of a jolly fire giant.   \"Hey man,\" I said, \"you guys do take-out, right?\"  \"Yeah bro. You on break?\"  \"Yeah, I work a block down. Listen, I need something quick to go. Can you help me out?\"  \"Of course, man,\" he reassured me with a smile and a mild laugh, already reminding me of some of my better co-workers.   I was handed a menu, and quickly I scanned it for panini, trying to remember just what I wanted to sample, finally arriving on something called Lucchese  \"That one.\"  \"Ok man, good choice. 6 minutes. Sit tight.\"  A young woman came over to ring me out and about...10 minutes later I got my food in a plastic shopping bag.  \"Thanks bro. Enjoy,\"  I returned to work with 20 minutes to spare--plenty of time to enjoy my lunch, which I enjoyed for the most part.   The Lucchese is a Camaro of sandwiches. Within a half-dome of ciabatta bread softened by pesto I found prosciutto, roasted peppers, fresh, oozing mozzarella... a sliver of Arcadia. One could complain that the prosciutto was a little scant, but this isn't the kind of ham one piles 2 inches thick a la corned beef. Prosciutto is too fragile, too subtle in its balance of sugar and salt, too aromatic for gluttony. It is rare, it must leave you wanting more, and it did in this instance. The roasted red peppers were almost unnecessary but welcome. The milky mozzarella, which formed beautiful strands as I pulled the panini from my teeth, made the panino legend, complimenting the prosciutto fully.   If I had to deduct a star, it would be for the absolutely dull lima bean (?) salad that needlessly came with the sandwich. Only some scallions could be found amongst the beans, and no olive oil or seasoning was detected in the drearily mild dressing. It was the gustatory equivalent of an awkward silence after a tryst. Aside from that misstep, this was a minor marvel of a midday meal. Molto bene!  P.S. On my end, the service was mannerly, amiable, prompt, and thoughtful. I was even offered a glass of water as I waited for my takeaway lunch.   P.P.S. Oh you know the goonies at work were eyeballin' my food.  \"Didju get dat at Subway? When'd they start sellin' 'em wit dat weird ass bread?\"  P.P.P.S. The damage? $7.50. Not bad if you ask me. Hey, the Wendy's down the road will beat you for more. That's no lie, either."}
{"text":"Piccolo Forno was not at all what I was expecting. It was very loud. All the dish/glassware was disgusting. Our wine glasses were dirty, and as we asked our waitress for clean ones she placed two plates on the table, which we noticed were also dirty. My boyfriend's fork also had to be replaced due to food grime. The table next to us were two construction workers who were way too comfortable and loud for our liking. We assumed they knew the owners/manager or would have been asked to quiet down. The food was ok. Over priced for sure. My boyfriend's pasta was undercooked so he asked for bread (which I should add we had to ask for, while it was given to the construction workers) and just used that to eat the sauce around the pasta. I have heard really good things about this place, but I am not likely to return."}
{"text":"Love the BYOB.  Had brick oven pizza's made in the back of the restaurant Food is fresh and hot.  Of course you need to like the brick oven style of pizza.  Sauce was not my favorite for some reason maybe to bitter?  Not sure?  and seemed to lack flavor.  Staff was nice.  Did not get to try the pasta. Salad and tiramisu were good."}
{"text":"So good!  We wanted a good meal in Little Italy, and this was fantastic!  They have a BYOB policy, but there is a wine store nextdoor that did the trick.  Delicious food and excellent service.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We had dinner at one of their outside tables on a warm evening last week while visiting Pittsburgh. We chose this restaurant after reading the reviews. Being from Canada, we are not used to BYOB's - wish we had planned better and brought some wine. That would have made the meal perfect. It was pretty awesome as it was though. We ordered the Margarita pizza for our six year old and it was very good. We devoured it. I had the Crespelle di Funghi which was very good but rich - the waiter warned me. Portions are large - I could only finish about a third of this dish. The BF had the braised rabbit pasta on the waiter's recommendation. The pasta was clearly homemade - very tender and cooked perfectly. The sauce was fabulous. We didn't order any of the salads but I wish we had - they were huge and looked and smelled delicious. We went there on a Saturday night around 9 and it was busy and very loud inside. Outside was much quieter. I would highly recommend this restaurant for great Italian food in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"My husband and I booked our rehearsal dinner at Piccolo Forno, and we loved it! Nealey was so easy to work with, and helped us create the perfect evening. Everyone loved the food, and the rustic, beautiful upstairs private room. They are also BYOB which helped us save money. We hit one snag in the evening (there was a confusion on the menu, we had ordered 2 vegetarian dishes that were not served), and Nealey fixed the issue immediately and refunded us for a portion of the meal.  I would definitely recommend Piccolo Forno for a private event, but also for dinner in the city!"}
{"text":"BEST FOOD I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE! this place is DELICIOUS! everything is handmade while you wait, and all the ingredients and flown in, fresh from Tuscany. Once we told the server it was our first time, she gave some history about the place. Its BYOB which took us by surprise, we really wanted some wine, and be prepared to wait, it was an hour wait on a Friday night. Absolutely delicious, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love the BYOB!  Better pizza than overpriced Il Shitzaiolo in Mt. Lebo.  Great big yummy salads.  BYOB.  Cool neighborhood.  BYOB."}
{"text":"Really amazing food, and vegetarian friendly.  Really was surprised to find this place, which reminded me of a great restaurant in the meatpacking district in Manhattan, at about 1/3rd the cost.  Never been there when it's been crowded, but the service is often appallingly slow.  I'd go there much more often - and bump this up to five stars - if it weren't an ordeal to get the bread that other tables seem to manage, or a refill on my drink.  If you have extra time, aren't in any hurry, and want great Italian that doesn't rely on marinara sauce, go now."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and there is typically a wait. The restaurant is small and has a very cozy vibe. Unfortunately, if you have to wait to eat here, there aren't too many places to explore and I would consider the area largely unwalkable.   Still, I think the pasta here is made properly and the pizzas are satisfying. However, I think they charge way too much for the amount of food that is served. Usually I pay $30/person when I visit Piccolo Forno.   I do like the BYOB! This has given me a chance to buy different wines and has reminded me of my days traveling through Europe."}
{"text":"I have only been here once but was pleased with my mascarpone and spec pizza and fennel salad.  The pizza should have been baked at least another 2 minutes because my crust was on the raw side.  But I like a crispy crust that holds horizontally.  I don't know but maybe they don't make it that well done.  I want to go back and try some other salads and a pasta.  I thought the service was very good.  I sat next to a couple of guys who were pretty obnoxious and gave the waitress suggestions on how to improve the menu and she handled it very well."}
{"text":"Four stars based on the pizza only. The pasta dishes leave something to be desired and are bland in flavor for the most part. The spaghetti with seafood was almost under  al dente and bordered not cooked all the way .. And I LIKE my pasta al dente. The mushroom pasta dish is bland, and the eggplant appetizer also left something to be desired. Go for the pizza, but go elsewhere - maybe to Il Pizzialo for the fresh pasta."}
{"text":"The blonde hostess is extremely rude and inconsiderate.  She started the evening off in a bad way, however the remaining shaft was good and the food was good.  I would not recommend this restaurant to others..does not matter how good the experience is if one person ruins the experience it is hard to enjoy the experience.  I would recommend the hostess be fired!!!"}
{"text":"Wild Italian boar over hand-made pasta, and one of my favorite salads!  Lawrenceville is the new best place to eat near the Burgh."}
{"text":"I like the restaurant. I am going to have to go back to actually taste the food. Work lunch was not impressive. We didn't have pasta. Who has a party at an Italian restaurant and not have pasta as a selection. Salad, weird sandwiches, and tomato soup or whatever it's called."}
{"text":"The food is great; the service/management/staff are terrible.  I'm with everyone who thinks the service here is pretentious and sometimes downright mean. PF, why must you treat customers so rudely? You are not a Michelin restaurant; you don't get to have \"seatings.\"  We had the same issue some other reviewers. Most of our party arrived at 7pm, but I was late. They wouldn't let them order. Thankfully, I texted in my order. They reminded my group repeatedly that they had another group at 9pm. Guess what? The 9pm group never showed, and the whole \"rush through dinner\" thing was mute.  Also, the food arrived in staggered courses. If you're going to have these strict seatings, then you should time the food to arrive together. My pasta is getting cold while I'm waiting for my friend's pizza, but I'm nervous that I won't finish by the 9pm required finish time so I feel like I should start eating. It's awful.  There have great pizzas at Porch and Mercurios and great pasta at Dish and Girasole. Don't put up with the rudeness; go somewhere else.  When the 9pm party didn't show, we ordered dessert. The dessert ice cream bomb is ridiculous good."}
{"text":"While in town visiting family, my mother insisted we drive from Cranberry Twp into Pittsburgh to have dinner at Piccolo Forno. We had a party of 4, so our quoted wait was only about an hour. We were able to wait in the bar around back and enjoy a beverage.The space was small and it's BYOB (which we knew in advance so we brought our own wine), but is was really pretty with the exposed brick and low lighting. Our waitress was fantastic and I wish I could remember her name.   Two people in our group ordered pizza and they each looked delicious. My mom said that their pizza was some of the best she's ever had. I'm more of a pasta lover, though, so I ordered the Cappelletti di Taleggio - cheese stuffed cappelletti, pistachio brown butter, brussel sprouts and balsamic.  It was so good I hardly paused for a drink and certainly scarfed it all up before I could offer anyone else a taste (whoops!)   We had a birthday in our group, which we casually mentioned, and our waitress brought us a piece of tiramisu (so good) and we also ordered coffees and limoncello gelato (delightful!)   Everyone in the restaurant seemed to be enjoying themselves and their food, which is always a plus. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and would love to return again when in town! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Cute little place. Yummy, fresh tasting pizzas and some amazing looking pasta dishes (never tried the pasta though). It's a small intimate restaurant, so I'd suggest making a reservation even on a weeknight."}
{"text":"Delicious! My only regret is not ordering the pizza. We brought our wine with us from The bar next donor, which is owned by the restaurant. The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice -comfortable seating, dim/glowing lighting, not too loud. And the food was excellent. We tried the lamb pasta, the fish special and the squash ravioli. For apps, we had the octopus and a salad. And for desert, we had tartfutto and tiramisu.  Everything was great and we we will for sure go back for the pizza, which looked delicious in the table next to us."}
{"text":"As a native New Yorker, I don't think I'm a pizza snob, but I am pretty knowledgeable; and Piccolo Forno's pizzas are among the best I've ever had anywhere. Very thin crusts, imaginative toppings, especially the excellent eggplant.  I notice some of the other Yelpers have complained about long waits on popular nights. Well, if a small restaurant has tremendous food, long waits on Friday or Saturday nights are inevitable. We went at 5 pm on Tuesday night...were going to a Pirates game at 7 pm...and were seated and served quickly.   In a way, Piccolo Forno patrons have the same problem as Pirates fans: Used to be you could walk up to the ticket window 10 minutes before game time and get great seats twenty rows behind home plate. Now you're lucky to get seats a hundred feet above the left fielder.  Produce a great product and more customers show up."}
{"text":"I called in last night to ask how long the wait was on a Saturday night and was told about 20 minutes. We arrived, put my number in so they could call when a table was ready (nice feature) and left. Within walking two blocks of the restaurant my phone rang so the wait was not as bad as it appeared to be in the reviews.  I ordered a small house salad which was simple and delicious and my boyfriend ordered the fennel orange salad, which was a huge portion. And then for our entrees we ordered pizza - prosciutto with arugula and the quattro. The prosciutto was absolutely delicious but the quattro was soggy in the middle from the mushrooms, peppers and artichoke which was disappointing.  The hostess was friendly and while there were no issues with our waitress she did not smile, which made her appear a bit cold but I guess that is just her personality."}
{"text":"GRAZIE! BRAVO! you guys kicked this 1 out of the park! i'm talking about the new year's eve dinner they had. 5 course meal for $60. we've been for other dinners as well as their normal menu, but this was FANTASTIC! 1st, we got our fav waitress sophia! hey girl! the entire team was working quick & as a team, each helping the other. as fast as they were working, so was the kitchen. the courses came at a nice pace. there was a vegan menu, but we're both meaties! they did get 3 courses the same as us. the 2 changed courses were chickpea ragu & panisse, &tomato tagliatelle with king trumpets. so, the 1st course was a porcini \"cappuccino\" with tomato biscotti & olive oil. it came in a cappuccino cup with foam on top. it played with my mind. it looked like coffee, but tasted oh so different! even after a few sips, it still got me! it was a very 'shroomy\" tasting soup. 4 stars! course 2 was an endive & pear salad with caramelized carrots, gorgonzola & pistachio. a salad, big deal! no! it was an awesome salad! i'm trying to make the caramelized carrots at home! 4 stars! course 3 was braised beef cheeks with cippollini onions, parsip panna cotta, sourdough with fig demi. this NEEDS to be on the menu!!! the meat was so soft, you didn't need a knife. the panna cotta. it was like \"buttah\"! it was like silk. we wanted to lick the plate clean! 4 stars! course 4 was squid ink tagliatelle with lobster, cauliflower, wild mushrooms & saffron oil. what can I say but yum! perfect! 4 stars! & finally, course 5 was a warm spice bread pudding with fig jam, honey, pistachio & goat cheese. O.M.G.!!! i'd bathe in this stuff! a lot of bread puddings are dry. not this! it was so moist. the cool thing was that they froze the goat cheese in sticks! it went with the pudding so well. oh, & a glass of prosecco from the house! if you never go any other time, try to make sure you hear about the new year's eve menu at piccolo forno, & GO!"}
{"text":"I had my graduation private party for 30 people at Piccolo Forno- it was wonderful. Domenic and his mother created a wonderful 4 course meal- they were very responsive to my requests, the service was awesome. I cannot recommend this place enough for any of your events. Lidias wanted a minimum $1500 for a reservation of 30 people in a non-private area, with tax, tip we came in below $1500 and had the whole restaurant of Piccolo Forno- wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Italian restaurant in the city! BYOB at $5 a bottle is a steal. Also there is a liquor store two blocks away, which usually takes up the time waiting for a table. They do not take reservations but the meal is always worth the wait, which has never been extremely long. I try not to go during the dinner rush, I like to eat a little bit later, so I avoid the very long waits.  The Lasagna is so amazing! There are so many layers and the pasta is so thin. There is also a beschemel sauce on it that just makes it so perfect! It comes out piping hot also and the ingredients taste very fresh.  I always have the soup of the day and it's always great. My favorite salad is the mozzarella and tomato. The salads are large portions, enough for two people to split for a first course.  If you have room for dessert, splurge on the Tiramisu with an epresso or black coffee. If you don't finish it, the staff will package it up for you to take home. My brother loves the gelato, he orders it every time.   The service from the servers is always great. They are prompt and visit the table often. They are knowledgeable about the menu offerings. I have a gluten intolerance and they happily accommodated this, and told me what I could order."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed everything about our visit here. To our knowledgable server (sorry I forgot your name) with personality. The lentil soup was tasty, the pizzas perfect, the appetizers, the dinners, gelato, cappuccino. Loved it all. We will definitely be back next time we are in Pitt. I also appreciate that they let me know it was BYOB when I called so I could stop for a bottle of wine on my way."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. This place was amazing. Wanted a nice dinner with some family after the holidays and heard about this little gem. Didn't disappoint. We started with the margarita pizza as an app. I highly recommend it. Not too filling and just enough to share (there was 4 of us) on to the main course we all had to try something different. I had the braised rabbit dish and it was the favorite at the table. We also had the squid ink dish and a braised lamb. All super good. However the highlight for me was the dessert. The cappuccino ice cream dish was hands down the greatest dessert ever. Could have ordered one more of those. The portion sizes were just right and the Service was amazing. We will be back and will recommend it to all our friends"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here last weekend! It's been on my radar, but always seem to have forgotten about it until now. We went at around 5:30 thinking we could beat a dinner rush since they don't make reservations. Boy were we off on that assumption it was a full house. We were told there was about a 70 minute wait, but they offered to hold our wine (BYOB) and would call when ready. This was made ok by Gapperia.  It was our time to eat at the time we were told our wait would be. We ordered a prosciutto rucola pizza and the butternut squash tortellini. The crust to sauce to cheese ratio was perfect! The homemade noddles I am still daydreaming about. Everything was full of flavor and fresh. We finished our meal by splitting a peanut butter chocolate gelato that was rotating in the menu which was amazing.   Our waiter was very nice and attentive. The decor is simple and tho it is very small inside you don't feel like you're on top of the table next to you. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I had dinner with three friends at Piccolo Forno this past weekend.  Since it was a Friday night, we had to wait about 45 minutes for a seat, and finally got one at a small 4 top near the front door.  Since it is BYOB we could get right to business on our wine while we debated over the rather large menu.  We shared two large, fresh salads and the bruschetta for appetizers.  The bruschetta toppings were extremely pungent! If you are into the featured flavors, load up!  My friend and I decided to share the Quattro Stagioni (Crushed tomatoes and fresh mozzarella with four separate sections of prosciutto, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, and artichokes) and the Cannelloni di Cinghiale (baked, boar and apple filled cannelloni with a pumpkin cream sauce, fontina, and sage pesto).  I thoroughly enjoyed the pizza, it was fresh, thin crust and the veggie toppings were roasted wonderfully.  I did not have the same feelings about the Cannelloni.  The sage pesto completely over-powered the dish to the point where I couldn't even finish my half.  I am not one to be turned off by herb flavors but something just did not work in this dish.   Stick to ordering the pizzas, that seems to be Piccolo Forno's strong suit."}
{"text":"I have been both with a group and just me and my momma. Both times I was treated to great food and a pleasant experience. I am confused why many places are closed on Sundays in the area. I tried to go after a matinee and was disappointed. Always check yelp for hours of operation!"}
{"text":"Went last night and was anxiously waiting our trip to this restaurant based on our Yelp readings. Lets start with the pizza was very good and the fact that you can bring your own wine for $5 is wonderful. But the downsides are the wait was excessive, 45 minutes. Also they do accept reservations, contrary to Yelp description and our looking at empty tables waiting for the reservations to come in. Our waitress was overwhelmed and kept on forgetting to bring us the staple items, like bread and cheese, but I do not blame her. The pasta dishes were OK not great. We had the cavatelli dish and the ravioli with salmon, again both were just ok, actually slightly salty. Dessert was very good. Thus overall three stars."}
{"text":"I've had pretty good pizza here before, but I certainly don't think it's the best pizza of it's type in the East End (Dinette is FAR superior). The appetizers are fine -- the brushetta is good. But the pasta. Oh, the pasta. It's all reasonably priced ($11-$16) and on a recent visit I decided to get the more expensive shrimp pasta.   Now, by the description it sounded like it would be in a garlic oil sauce with crushed tomatoes. It came with a thick paste of tomato sauce that was overwhelmed by capers. I like capers when they're an addition to the flavor, but these were the flavor. That and an extremely fishy taste to the sauce really ruined it for me. But if that hadn't, the terrible pasta would have.   I've never before had fresh pasta that I thought was inedible. Thankfully there was a generous amount of large plump shrimp to almost make up for the inedible pasta and sauce. But I left hungry. My dining companion's pasta dishes weren't much better. The gnocchi was edible but gummy and there was a salmon ravioli special that was overwhelmingly salty.  Also, the wait staff seems either rushed or inattentive. We waited for everything and my soup was forgotten.   I'm not wasting my time again. Dinette has better pizza and anywhere has better pasta."}
{"text":"I am not the type of person who seeks out Italian restaurants; I usually gravitate toward other food genres when given the choice. However, Piccolo Forno is one of my favorite restaurants in Lawrenceville, and I highly recommend it!  I've been to Piccolo multiple times, and I am always impressed with the service and the food. The restaurant is beautiful and has a homey Italian feel while still feeling hip. If you're lucky, you'll be seated by one of the large windows at the front. One of the things that I love about Piccolo Forno is the fact that it's BYOB. They do charge an uncorking fee, but it's nice to be able to bring your own bottle (or two!) of wine. Also, If you have a long wait for your table, I recommend going right around the corner to Grapperia for a cocktail. You will not be disappointed.  I honestly think Piccolo Forno has some of the best Italian food I've ever had. My favorite appetizer on the menu is the Torre Di Melanzane. It has layers of eggplant, basil, mozzarella, and other squash; it reminds me of a ratatouille, but even better. For an entrée, I highly recommend both the lasagna and all of the wood fired pizzas. This is not my highest-ranked craft pizza in Pittsburgh (Mercurio's holds that coveted spot), but it runs a close second. All of the pizzas are flavorful, fresh, and authentic. I particularly love the Speck E Marscapone pizza which includes tomatoes, mozzarella, marscapone, and speck (which is a type of cured meat). You really can't choose a bad pizza here, so get a few different ones to try and take home leftovers!  Piccolo Forno is a wonderful place for anything from a date night to a group celebration. Sure, you may not be able to just waltz right in and get a table - but that just goes to show you that the caliber of food at Piccolo is worth waiting for!"}
{"text":"GET THE LASAGNA!!!! The lasagna is my last meal if I am ever on death row!!!! You can bring your favorite bottle of wine and they will serve it for you. You can eat inside or out. I really can not say enough about this place. I should say bad things so people don't make it harder to get a table but this really is my favorite place to eat in the world. We visit family in Lawrenceville and are disappointed if we don't get that lasagna. I've had their pizza and soups and loved them. We always get the same thing... can you guess? Please open on Sunday's!"}
{"text":"The food is very good, but we will not return because of the uncertain wait times and lack of reservations ..."}
{"text":"Piccolo forno is one of those restaurants that people seem to rave about. I fortunately was hungry tonight and visited this nice little lawrenceville spot.   First, the hostess was very nice, you don't have to wait to hear your name called, they very practically take your number and call you when you're up...duh!  After a short wait we were seated. The place has a very nice feel. Brick walls, tall ceilings and simple decor make it feel high quality without being pretentious.  Three of us shared the arugala salad, prosciutto and arugala pizza, and tagliatelle in a lamb ragu.  I also had a bowl of pasta fagioli and to be honest, it wasn't good.  I never add salt to restaurant food and especially not soup but this needed flavor and fast. Good texture but more of an unseasoned bean puree to me. The salad was everything a salad should be, light, fresh, and a great way to start a meal.  The pizza was outstanding, thin, chewy, delicious fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, all topped with a heaping  dollop of nutty arugala. Yum. Finally the tagliatelle, first, they give you a huge, american-sized portion great for sharing.  The pasta was for the most part cooked properly, though I prefer it extra al dente, this was definitely al dente. The lamb ragu was just good, flavorful, but the lamb pieces were a bit dry.   The rest of the menu looks delicious and I look forward to trying other dishes. 4 stars due to eh soup an slightly dry lamb but we'll see what next time brings.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a few times now and always in a different situation (lunch versus dinner, group versus pair). It's grown on me a lot. Initially, the thought of a small restaurant without reservations really turned me off, but last time we went at peak time, we drove over put our name in and then headed to Mount Washington. By the time we were done there, our table was ready.  I like that they are BYOB and they don't charge a fee per glass, but rather per bottle. They are famous for their pizza but I actually think ordering that is cheating yourself because their other dishes are really great. Their pasta is amazing! The bruschetta is amazing, the lasagna as well. There vegetarian dishes are not cop outs either which is a big plus for my family."}
{"text":"I've eaten there twice now, and both times have been satisfying. I think I'd rate the dish I had the second time higher than the first. It was a pasta dish with a ground wild boar meat sauce, spiced with cloves, star anise and some other good stuff. I quite enjoyed it. The other two dishes ordered were similarly pleasing. The prices aren't inflated. One of the better Italian places in Pittsburgh/"}
{"text":"We get there. Reservations for six at 6. Half our party is there, half is on it's way. We tell them we're here. Can't sit until the whole parties there. I get that. But then the hostess adds \"we have a party at 8 PM that's sitting at your table and you'll have to leave by then.\" I get that, sometimes you gotta hustle.  We sit at 6:15 with our whole party. Our server comes up without even a GREETING and says, \"we have another party sitting here at 8 PM, so you'll have to be done by then.\" I don't get that....  That was just a little too much! I've never been anywhere that was so blatant about getting you outta there asap. I understand you've got to move people in and out, but don't tell us when we haven't even ordered a thing and are planning on spending money in your establishment! Even with taking our time we were done at 7:45 PM. Plenty of time to clean off the table for this important party.   Too bad because the food was good. The service left a little to be desired..."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing and the atmosphere is cozy and comfortable. I come here a few times a year and always get the same thing. I love coming for lunch on a Saturday, no wait and fast service."}
{"text":"Piccolo-Forno is a cozy italian restaurant.  I liked the exposed brick walls, massive pizza oven and stylized black and white photographs of the Mediterranean decorating it.  They also have BEAUTIFUL tiling covering the bathrooms, it's worth making a trip to the water closet just to admire it!  It's a small place with a lot of small tables crammed in, so some times it felt a bit claustrophobic, like you were going to accidentally trip the waiter or  bump the feet of the patrons next to you with your feet.  My wife and I ordered the polenta appetizer and meatballs.  The polenta was light and fluffy and was served with delicious toppings like tomato, mozzarella and olives, I'd highly recommend them.  The meatballs were small, bland, and bone dry, but fortunately came with a tasty side of pesto sauce that went well with them.    We knew we had to try the pizza because we'd heard so many good things, and it's one of the specialties on the menu.  For our main courses she got the quattro mixed topping pizza with red peppers, artichokes, mushrooms and prosciutto.  I got the lasagna.  The mushroom was served with the traditional italian style with thin crust, and a minimalist approach to adornments.  Admittedly, we like generous cheese and toppings, but in this case we both felt the toppings were to sparse and left the pizza feeling lacking  and was too close to just eating plain bread.  My lasagna on the other hand, was absolutely PERFECT.  It was so savory it melted in your mouth and the balance of pasta, meat and cheese was as good as I've had.  We got the chocolate bomb gelato for dessert which was average, but had a hard chocolate coating, which put a different spin on it.  The bill for 2 came to $65 without drinks, which seemed high given the hit or miss dishes and cramped tables.  I've heard so many good things I really wanted to LOVE piccolo forno, but despite my high hopes, I could only like it."}
{"text":"I am Italian and have been to many Italian restaurants in my day- casual and more upscale-and this place was not worth the trip.  The pizza was fair and the cheese runny;  the appetizer with meats (prosciutto)and cheeses (Italian?)  was dry and sparse and not terribly authentic. And $18 for a large- yikes!. . And pickled veggies and grapes?? What's up with that? The sandwiches were made with bread that was not really Italian or even crusty. I was really disappointed ! They did have a parking which was nice and I did like the vibe. Place looks great but the food does not live up to to that!"}
{"text":"Our party didn't order any pizzas so I won't be able to comment on them.  The food tasted ok but nothing to write home about.   This is a place where you would take a date but if you want real Italian food, you should go elsewhere.  Also, this restaurant isn't located in a upscale neighborhood but charges like it was.   I paid $19 for my dish and it was full of pasta with very little protein.  Who wants to eat a full plate of pasta?  My daughter ordered a pasta dish with rabbit.  There were only like 3 piece of rabbit meat and they charged $17 for it.  And the dish had no flavor.  I definitely will not return and I'll be searching for a restaurant that makes real Italian food."}
{"text":"This is the best Italian restaurant. I'm Italian so I can honestly say this is authentic and worth every dollar and every minute of a wait for a table. The menu is simple pizza and pasta. The price is right nothing over $20. It's BYOB for wine. I had the polenta appetizer. Delish! And the pesto with walnuts, green peas, and small little potatoes. For dessert the tiramisu was excellent. It's a nice restaurant with brick oven and white marble tables. As I said earlier be prepared to wait for a table. Boun appetito!"}
{"text":"This is a great BYOB. I travel to Pittsburgh on business a few times a year. I look to Yelp to find cool places because who really wants to eat (and pay) at the hotel restaurant all the time. I came across this place and I must say its a great find. The food is good, pizza not as much of a crunch as I would like but still good. The place gets very busy but still holds its intimate feel. Yes, from some of the other reviews it gets a tad noisy but not something so bad you could not hear the person across from you. I would defiantly be back."}
{"text":"The food and service was very good.  We split two pizzas among four people.  While waiting for our pizza we had two salads. Two bowls of pasta figioli which was very good.  My only complaints: 1. was the parking.  The side lot was too small.  Ended up parking on the street.  2. The menu needs to be rewritten to clearly explain in English what the food item contains."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Piccolo Forno in a long time mostly because I know that it's always packed and they don't take reservations unless you have a party of 6 or more, however the food is definitely worth the wait.  On my most recent visit I went to dinner there with a friend around 8:45 PM assuming that it wouldn't be crowded, but the place was packed to capacity and we had to put our name on the list for a table (it took about 20 minutes).  I ordered the Tagliatelle con Ragu di Agnello which is braised lamb with olives on spinach tagliatelle topped with orange zest and grated cacio cavallo.  The pasta was so fresh and delicious that you could actually taste the flour - I know that might sound odd, but I mean it in the absolutely best way - you could tell by the smell, texture, flavor of the Tagliatelle that it had just been made - it hadn't been sitting around and wasn't stale of overcooked - it was absolute perfection!  The orange zest added an interesting brightness to the dish, though I found it a little overpowering but overall the dish was delicious - the lamb was braised just right and was melt in your mouth tender and the olives were just the right amount of salt to give a depth and earthiness to the dish.  My friend ordered one of the hand-tosses pizze - the Quattro Stagioni which came with 4 different toppings (sectioned off) and she said that she could tell that the pizze dough was handmade that the toppings were all fresh and quality ingredients.  My only complaint is similar to what some other people have posted which is that the hostess was not pleasant at all.  She seemed exasperated that I wanted to put our names on the list and really seem to dislike her job, and unfortunately, our waitress wasn't much friendlier.  I'm sure this is just because the place is so busy and it's obviously stressful when there is no downtime for them but it's unfortunately part of their job to deal with customers and it seems to me that it should be a GOOD thing that the restaurant is so busy because that means job security.  I will definitely go back again, but I might try to go during an \"off\" time when I have a day off during the week, that's not also a holiday so that maybe they will be a little less crazy and I can enjoy the atmosphere without feeling rushed and cramped in."}
{"text":"I want to say first that my girlfriends and I had a lovely dinner here, but there are many elements that, if changed, would bring this place up to five stars, in my opinion.   First, the noise level is very loud. We were screaming at each other to be heard.   Second, the food was good, not great. I wasn't extremely impressed with the tagliolini. I also tried my friend's pizza, and the crust was soggy. Wood fired pizza soggy?   Third, where was the bread? I'm not a carb crazed person, but this was the first Italian restaurant I've been to that didn't serve bread.   The prices were very reasonable, and for that, I am grateful. The more BYOB restaurants in town, the better I say.  Service was to the point."}
{"text":"Excellent homemade pasta! The appetizers - polenta and verdure miste - were outstanding. The tomato mozzarella salad was great. We had the tagliatelle w mushrooms, fettucini w boar and seafood pasta. All were perfect! We loved the tiramisu w the lemon oil and the peanut butter icecream. This place is just perfect!"}
{"text":"Boy and I went to Piccolo Forno around seven on a Thursday evening. When we arrived, all the tables were filled and we were told that a table for two was a 25 minute wait.  Like other reviewers, we went to a neighboring bar until we were called back for our table. For the record, this does not bother me.  I more than expect there to be crowds and wait times when a business is small and popular!  Moreover, if one plans or calls ahead, it is easy to work around such things.  At any rate, the restaurant called us a mere 20 minutes later and upon our return, we were seated by a friendly host.     The menu offers many Italian appetizers, salads, pizzas, panini and pasta entrees. I looked around and realized most people ordered pizza. Boy and I each chose pasta, with him ordering the tortelli with pork and beef in a bolognese sauce. I opted for the salmon ravioli.  Boy's entree was delicious, but I was forced to do something I hate... return a dish. Something simply did not sit right with me. The salmon ravioli was tossed in a rather bland sauce.  I couldn't take more than a few bites.  Thankfully, our waitress was extremely gracious and let me pick something else (which happened to be the very tasty lasagna).  Even though we offered to pay for all three dishes, they did not charge us for the ravioli.    Something random I observed about the food. Piccolo Forno LOVES nutmeg.  Nutmeg is often used in béchamel sauce (which is in their lasagna), but I found it a tad overpowering as it was in all three pasta sauces we had.    Dessert was a delicious peanut butter gelato with a caramel center covered in chocolate. One of the better desserts I have ever had!   I will sum up with some pros and cons.   Pros:  The food was good (the dessert was better)! Service is friendly and helpful.  Cons: The restaurant is small, which can lead to noise and cramped seating. A little too much nutmeg.  Lastly, and this is just a silly pet peeve of mine, their website reminds me of MySpace in that it BLASTS music at you.    I'd like to go back and try the pizzas and paninis."}
{"text":"Great Place !!  Lots to look at and the food is authentic!!  We will be back for sure !"}
{"text":"Oh man so good. I think this is one of the best meals that I have had in a while. My wife is a huge fan of pasta and I can't blame her of course it's delicious. Piccolo is serving up some delicious food that you have to try.   I had the \"Rotolo Trecolori\" which was delicious. I don't know if I can describe the crape, spinich, carrot, pepper, cheese sauce goodness but trust me it was good. I was all like \"I got to learn how to make this\".   Anyway finished off the mean with a very decent espresso and chocolate covered ice cream and left very happy and full.  This is a take your friends from out of town type place which is just what we intend to do."}
{"text":"Piccolo Forno is a great neighbor joint.  We went right before the crowds started to come in.  When you first come you notice the well decorated and inciting atmosphere and see some of the kitchen in the middle of the restaurant.  The food was good, the portions were right and everything was fresh.  It isn't the cheapest place, but being BYOB helps it out.  It's definitely a place I will check out again - perhaps for lunch, some of the paninis looked great."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Very good food. Try the mushroom crespele. Or the spinach ravioli. Very fast and good service. Would like to try for dinner."}
{"text":"If only Piccolo Forno attended to the minor details aside from the truly delicious brick oven pizza:  - The rest of the menu. Nothing aside from the pizza was particularly memorable or even particularly well made, including a pretty uninspired house salad and an overly salty olive tapenade.  - Service. While the BYOB policy is great, and clearly what they're known for in the neighborhood, the service is aloof rather than warm and welcoming. Definitely leaves something to be desired.    - Flies. We sat by the window and several flies buzzed around us during our entire meal. Not OK.  The pizza did not disappoint, but overall it wasn't the experience I had hoped for."}
