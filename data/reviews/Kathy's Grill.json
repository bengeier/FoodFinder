{"text":"Kathy's grill is amazing. The food is always fresh and cooked to perfection. The home made burgers, the chicken dinners, bacon cheese dogs are just a few menu items that we get often and never disappoint. Would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Kathy's Grill is a welcome addition to the Dorset Park neighbourhood.  At the moment, they are still waiting for the permits to come through for seating.
The food is excellent!  I love the souvlaki dinner; the meat is grilled to perfection, the Greek salad and rice were very tasty as well.  Can't wait to try their home made lasagna - it looked delicious from behind the glass.  I have been a number of times, and will return again soon."}
{"text":"Best burgers in Scarborough. No doubt about it. The double homemade hamburger is perfection."}
{"text":"It has good quality food at great prices. They aren't stingy with the ingredients they put in their dishes as they aren't like any fast food chain out there. Worth a visit. I come by when I'm around the area."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and it wasn't too busy.

Pros:
- Seating area
- Parking
- Good service
- Food tastes good

Cons:
- Need ketchup containers
- no WiFi"}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly service, just like when they were at Harry's Drive-in.
Fresh salads and the souvlaki dinners with rice were my favorite.
They give so much food so I had to take the leftover home to finish.
It was unusual to have poutine with feta cheese but it was good.
Gyro was also my favorite."}
{"text":"No BS burger.  Nothing fancy.. no kale or aioli. You get to pick either a fresh homemade burger or something from frozen that's done over a grill.  It's tasty.  No secret menus.  You don't need a mortgage to buy one.

This is the type of local mom and pop burger joint I grew up on.. I'm done with all those other fancy schmancy \"gourmet\" places."}
{"text":"I would probably give this a 4.5 if I could.

Simple decor, only counter tops with high stools for seating. All of the people were very friendly. I ordered the double homemade hamburger with cheese and peameal bacon, as well as a poutine with feta cheese.

The burger was delicious. $3 for 2 thick slices of peameal back was well worth it to me. The burger patties were fresh, tasty and juicy. The bun was well toasted which gave my burger a much needed crisp.

The poutine serving was very generous. The gravy was good. My only complaint was that the gravy drowned out the feta cheese, so as I ate it, I could barely recognize the feta if at all.

The regular poutine is made with shredded cheddar cheese. No cheese curds here.

Overall, very happy. Want to try the souvlaki next."}
{"text":"The \"Opening Soon\" signs alluded me every time I stopped by my local Starbucks, wondering what this new restaurant would be like. Coming back from vacation and seeing it now open meant it was time to check out this new addition to the neighbourhood.

We walked in and were greeted by a lady (who I presume was Kathy) and noticed some familiar faces from Harry's Drive-In (who I haven't seen there in so long) behind the counter. According to some Google reviews, it looks like Harry's Drive-In is being run under new management and it looks like the former employees have opened up shop down the road.

The menu and pricing looked familiar too, with the burgers, souvlaki, and even their poutine made with cheddar cheese. They only had seating along the window with the high chairs, but they mentioned that they were still in process of getting more furniture for additional seating. Also, the outside area looks like it could accommodate for outdoor seating, but we will have to wait for the warm weather to see if it comes into fruition. 

I ordered the Gyros Dinner while my mother ordered the Pork Souvlaki Dinner. In addition to the salad, we were given a choice between fries or rice. For $10.50 each, we were given a FULL take-out container of fries/rice and salad, along with our meat; five slices of gyros for me and a skewer of pork souvlaki for my mom. The meat was moist and flavourful and with the sides it came with, it was more than enough for one meal and you could easily save the other half for later.

Unfortunately, they don't have the advantage of being located in the plaza or by the elementary and high school which I am sure drives business to Harry's. We went around the lunch hour and it wasn't too busy. Other than my mom and I, there was one student who stopped by and a construction worker who drove in and placed a big order.

To my surprise, the Starbucks next door has been doing well so hopefully Kathy's is able to achieve the same traffic as the Starbucks and become a permanent staple to the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Good tasting food, affordable prices, and the nicest staff and service!

Came here today before 6PM, and the place wasn't busy. We were the only customers when we entered. Thought I'd check them out based on the positive reviews on Yelp.

Got a regular hamburger, really good size for only $3 something, was a tiny bit salty. But over-all good.

The chicken souvlaki is a must-try, as the portions are huge and the chicken is really tasty!

One thing that's worth mentioning is the quality of their fries. The fries are not salty at all. Really tasty, and the gravy is good!!

The owners/staff are all nice - and when we forgot to order a side of gravy after paying, they just added one to our order with no extra cost.

Would gladly come back when we are in the area. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Tr√©s bon. Very good. If you are a fan of Harry's drive-in, you will enjoy this place.
The cooks from Harry's apparently left and started this place up."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a classic burger joint with excellent burgers, fries and gravy to die for, and the best onion rings, then look no further. I had a home burger banquet and onion rings and couldn't get enough!  Chicken souvlaki and Greek salad are also great. Family business, very clean, you I'll not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a top notch Greek Grill place like this for a while! This place lives up to expectations, believe me! 
I've been eyeing it for months from the windows of SBucks which shares the same parking lot, I don't know what took me so long to try it out! 
We ordered a chicken souvlaki dinner (Rice, roasted potatoes, Greek salad, chicken souvlaki, side of tzatziki) a small Greek salad, and an order of onion rings. 
All of the food was fresh and very visually appealing. Both salads were loaded with toppings and very fresh lettuce; no mushy brown lettuce here! The chicken souvlaki was very moist. Never had chicken clean breast so well done and that moist before, amazing!
We'll be back again real soon. Like, maybe tonight!"}
{"text":"Kathy's Grill is so yummy! Love seeing Gus again after all of these years! Great souvlaki on a bun, burgers and fries with gravy. The staff was so nice to our kids. You should definitely check it out."}
{"text":"MMMM....is all I can say. After several of my co-workers raved about this place, I decided to try it. I ordered the Greek Salad with the chicken breast. Totally worth the price! loaded with Feta Cheese and yummy dressing. A huge chicken breast. Not a cheap frozen season breast, but actually a full chicken breast. Very clean and accessible. I'll be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place.  I thought it was just going to be another hole in the wall burger joint but I was 100% wrong.  It's spacious, super clean, inexpensive and the staff were very friendly and helpful.   You order at the front where the food is assembled and go to your table or take out.  The food we ordered was super tasty and we will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly, portions are very large, and food quality is great. Good value for the price."}
