{"text":"A friend took me here b/c I was visiting from out of town and it was a blast. It's like a \"Paint and Sip Wine\" spot but 100x better!! They have tons of project options (including the original 'paint and sip') plus they serve coffee, wine, great craft beer, and pizza. Music was good, but it would've been cool if I could've plugged in my Spotify (although maybe not since some folks hate 90's rap). Honestly, if I had a place like this in town, it would be a go-to date night spot."}
{"text":"Had so much doing my first evert piece of art. Had such a great night at this DIY studio with Yelpers! I brought home with me my unique design . I would want to hold a ladies night and have some  and  while I craft."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Pinnovate and love that it is in the deep SE Calgary and not downtown as it sometimes is and that it is so close to my house.  Back in the spring I did a painting class here where they gave us a piece of plywood board and a stencil that said spring has sprung and we got to paint it and decorate it with anything- it was great!  Then just recently Pinnovate celebrated their first birthday party. At their birthday their was complimentary goodies from cobs bakery, complimentary ice cream or gelato from Fiasco gelato, pizza from coco brooks and coffee from rosso coffee roasters.  They also were making balloon animals. We could visit and tour the store and paint complimentary cards with water colors.  It was great!"}
{"text":"I love that Pinnovate has opened in my neighbourhood. I stopped in briefly to grab a coffee (Yay for downtown coffee businesses being served in the burbs) and checked out the menu and craft options. I will definitely be coming back for a girls night soon! I think Pinnovate does a great job of serving the people who want to do all those Pinterest type crafts but doesn't want to go buy all the materials for something that might not work out. They have easy instructions on the iPads which I briefly checked out and you can shop all the tasty eats, drinks and local products."}
