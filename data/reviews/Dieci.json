{"text":"Chef Jeff has done it again! Amazing food, amazing service-- we had the caprese salad, bread basket with three different incredible sauces, the rigatoni (to die for!!) and a pizza (also excellent!). We left full bellied and happy hearted. Dieci and sister restaurant, Ten, are the real deal! Can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! I would definitely recommend this to others! If you are a fan of fresh delicious Italian food, then go check this place out!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing service!!!!!   We love the chef.  Pasta machine imported from Italy!!!!!   Great bartender, amazing customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Great service and even better food.  Salad options are fantastic.  The staff and owners/chefs are very accommodative."}
{"text":"I would try to keep this place a secret but restaurants in the Esplanade have a hard time surviving and this one needs to stay!  Not only was the food amazing, the people there are great!  The owner and chef both chatted with us and you can tell how passionate they are about creating some amazing food. We had the bread with tomatoes, arancini, bucatini carbonara, a steak special and tiramisu. Literally every dish was amazing. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Dieci for an impromptu date on Friday night, and had a great experience. It was extremely easy to make a last minute reservation with yelp, and our experience was extraordinary. Our server was amazing, and all of the food was outstanding. We got the Parmesan and marinara bread, a side of burrata (I didn't want a whole caprese), lasagna, pepperoni and sausage pizza, and zeppole. Everything was extremely fresh and tasty. I'm eating left over zeppole for breakfast as I write this!"}
{"text":"Love. Love. Love. Simple food, but oh, so delicious. I had lasagna -- moist and flavorful. Hubby had the Carbonara --  creamy and mmmmmm. We shared the Italian Chop salad (salads are enormous) Our server was great and the chef came by to say hello.
Please give this place a try. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the Esplanade at the Biltmore. The shrimp scampi was fabulous. The home made pasta was so tender and delicious. A must try."}
{"text":"WOW. Hidden gem in Phoenix! This place just opened recently and I am expecting it to explode. The management and chef are incredible. They treat their people and guests so well. It is obvious they care about quality and taking care of people like it was their home. We tried the dessert special of the night which was a grown up \"pop tart.\" Words can't describe the flavor of the flaky crust and sweet raspberry insides. On the side was a strawberry ice cream glazed with balsamic with a little mint on top. Would HIGHLY recommend to anyone and I've eaten many places in Phoenix!!! Go go go!!!!!!!! Thank you Jeff and team!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem! We were greeted warmly, received impeccable service and the dishes we ordered were among the best pasta dishes we have had anywhere! Highly recommended! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"A-mazing! Caprese, arancini, bucatini pasta all fantastic.  Very friendly service from everyone (shout outs to Seth, Nicole, Brian)- and Chef Jeff stopped by the table frequently to chat and check in.  These people really care and it shows.  Twice before our dinner reservation they called us to let us know there would be a couple of large parties and it would probably be noisy. We didn't care at all, but the forewarning was appreciated and thoughtful. $7 house wine and a Negroni Bianco that should not be missed.  A new Biltmore neighborhood favorite."}
{"text":"My new favorite Italian restaurant in Phoenix. We went on a Saturday night, and it was surprisingly empty for being such an amazing restaurant. Fine by me- a shorter wait for the table and food. We had the rigatoni and the carbonara. Both were delicious! The pasta is homemade. The waitstaff were very friendly as well. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is tucked away, and you have to either work nearby or seek it out to find it. We ate there with our teenage sons on a Saturday night. The restaurant was busy but not full. Service was good. I had a grinder sandwich which I really liked. One son had a pizza which looked really good, and he thought was great. Son two had baked ziti which was very good and a large portion. Unfortunately, my wife's food was disappointing. She ordered a Caesar with grilled shrimp. The shrimp was fine. The salad was average at best. The dressing wasn't very good, and it didn't have any special parm or tasty crunch. I had the Caesar as the side for my grinder, and completely agreed with her. My wife doesn't order a lot of pizza or pasta, so not sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal here especially because of the chef. He personally came out to check how we were enjoying our meals. I loved mine which was the chicken pesto sandwich and a side of soup. Both were really good. My husband got the chicken parmesan which the server recommended. He wasn't very happy with it but was ok and he was just going to eat it. The chef insisted on remaking it and said he shouldn't just eat it if he doesn't love it. When it was remade it was better but he still didn't love it. The chef checked on him again and he insisted on making him a different dinner. We felt badly to complain again, but he was very pleasant and said we should love our meal. He made a spaghetti and meatball dish that my husband absolutely loved. I would definitely go back especially since the chef cares so much about his customers. We were very impressed. They own another restaurant in the same complex and we plan to try that one also."}
{"text":"Service was really good. Food was plentiful and nicely flavored. Could have used a bit more sauce on both my wife's and my plate but we like extra sauce on most Italian dishes."}
{"text":"After making a reservation well in advance, we were informed the day before our special dinner that they had two large parties and our reservation would not be honored. Oh, we could have a seat on the patio, in August! Sorry, but we do not patronize businesses who disrespect their customers."}
{"text":"5 for service, 5 for ambiance, 5 for the staff.  Well priced for the potions you get.  It's rare to walk out of a restaurant wanting to come back just because you like everyone and they treat you like a regular.  I loved that.  We tried: the bread basket, the bruschetta spread (tomatoes and balsamic), shrimp scampi, carbonara pasta and the forget about it pizza.  For me, and my tastebuds, I was underwhelmed.  The pizza dough was excellent and the ingredients were good but because of all of the cured meats, it was incredibly salty.  I love that they make their pasta in house but it's thick and starchy.  Carbonara wasn't quite right (perhaps the use of cream or butter or both which is a big no no in my Italian world) and the pancetta wasn't used for fat rendering so it didn't release the flavor it should have.  I personally prefer the use guanciale over pancetta.  The shrimp in the scampi were excellent.  Perfectly done.  The bread basket was a mixed bag.  Loved the rosemary bread but some of the others were too salty.  I love salt but it can be overdone.  Overall, I would give this place a try again because you leave feeling good and I think they will continue improve."}
{"text":"Delicious food! We got the bread combo and the arancini to start.  I haven't had arancini that tasty in years. I had the chicken parm, it was so tender I didn't even need a knife to cut it.  My wife had the soup and a steak salad and said both were delicious. The tiramisu was amazing.  All the portions were very large. 
 The staff was wonderful. Our waitress Natalie was sweet and very knowledgeable about the food and drinks. She even recommended a new way for me to enjoy my dirty martinis.

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this amazing restaurant amazing staff Jeff the chef was wonderful, our server was exceptional! The food was delicious from the appetizer to the main dishes! Highly recommended this restaurant"}
{"text":"Really excellent and attentive service from wait staff but frankly, the food was disappointing. After reading the reviews here I expected something at the level of Bianco or Cibo. But my pie (called Forget About It) had the taste and texture just marginally better than Domino's pizza. Seriously.
This pizza had a bunch of stuff piled on and I think that's what might've killed it. It was just too much overcooked meat on top of overcooked cheese, on top of mediocre dough. 
The tiramisu was amazing, however. Very large, not soggy at all, just the right texture. Not too heavy not too light. 
Their house cocktails are good and strong. Try the Ciao Bella if you're in the mood for something sweet and citrus-y with a major kick. 

The restaurant itself is nestled in the Esplanade complex. Since most of it is empty, you might think the whole place is abandoned. Not so. Find the AMC Theatres sign, and you're in the right area. 
Dieci has mostly just tables and chairs, no booths. Everything feels pretty small and cramped compared to many similar restaurants in the Valley. 
Overall neither me nor my guest were impressed by Dieci."}
{"text":"Be forewarned, this place is quite hidden; I don't think there is any signage from the road for it, or even out front of The Esplanade, where it is located on the ground floor.  We got lucky & just happened to turn the right direction after exiting the parking garage elevator.  
So, they somehow managed to lose our reservation, which seemed a bit irresponsible (& disappointing as I would not get my dining points)...but oh well, they were able to get us in promptly nevertheless.
We ordered a very nice assorted bread basket that came with various fun spreads... several of our party thought the pesto was the best, most flavourful we had ever had...just wonderful!  The bread basket is refillable (but probably not the spreads, FYI).
Everyone seemed happy with their entrees, from the pizza to the chicken parmesan; and my vegetarian daughter & myself were so happy to find that they had an interesting butternut squash ravioli topped with pine nuts...We thought it really lovely, though not exactly a generous portion.  Some of us got salads & were pleased to find that they make their dressings with olive oil instead of cheap soybean oil : )
We all shared an irresistible  dessert of Italian Zeppole, which was basically warm, deep fried donut bites with dipping icing...nice.
Our server was friendly & kept the guys in Coke refills (always a plus with our group)!
I also liked that it was quiet enough there to carry on a conversation easily.
Overall, Dieci is definitely worth a try...it is a pleasant & tasty evening out : )"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a hidden gem. Amazing food and drinks, great service and reasonable prices!
Can't go wrong with Carbanara or probably anything else."}
{"text":"This was my first time there and it was amazing . We all loved the fresh pasta it was light and very tasty. Everything we ordered not only tasted great but also looked great. Our server was  spot on and the atmosphere was comfortable and relaxing ."}
{"text":"I was hoping to give a higher rating.  The service was friendly and efficient and the chef came out to talk to us - always a class touch.

The $3 bread appetizer with diced tomatoes, olive oil, and basil was excellent and a generous portion size.

The baked rigatoni was okay.  I think if it had less of the ground sausage and more of the tomato chunks and ricotta cheese it would have been better.  As it was, it had a uniform dark meaty flavor to it.

My wife had the pork chop.  She said it was okay.  The standout was the polenta which was very good.

I think we will likely try again and see if we can find something on the menu that stands out more.  The service and ambience were very enjoyable."}
{"text":"The food was great.  Best calamari I've had with the peppers and dipped in their marinara sauce. The bread bowl is just carb heaven.  The chef offered to make my daughter Mac and cheese and that made her the happiest 4 year old.  Mac and cheese is absolutely the best we've had in the valley.  They need to put that on the menu.  Mushroom pizza is delicious.  Zeppoles great especially in that white sauce dip.  Drinks were good and cold.  And service was fantastic.  Forgive me as I slip into my food coma now...."}
{"text":"Excellent! Carbonara, calamari and the service is all top notch. The same owner owns TEN which is right next door."}
{"text":"A fantastic ultra thin hand made crust pizza with hot and spicy sauce. This place has the best Italian food. The whiskey was mixed perfect and the owner took great care of us too. Off to see Super Woman... this is a great place to eat first"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp and Dieci for bailing me out of a Valentine's Day jam. I didn't plan appropriately for the evening, so I just gritted my teeth together real sturdy-like and winged it on this selection. Besides the positive reviews, being able to make reservations within a two hour window right from Yelp was a \"A+++ will do business again\" moment.

The outdoor seating is limited, but its in a large, semi-covered alcove, so it doesn't feel confining. Musical selection included Bjork, Sneaker Pimps, Portishead, and Massive Attack (down tempo/trip-hop?), which I felt went well with the atmosphere. The volume was the correct setting as well, loud enough I could enjoy it and still carry on a conversation.

I particularly enjoyed the pesto, olive tapanade, and freshly baked breads, and the house salad with their homemade dressing! The wife and I split a shrimp and pasta dish, then ordered the tiramisu - also made in house! The food offerings were excellent and portion-wise didn't feel overpriced.

For me, this restaurant ticked all the boxes, and my wife enjoyed herself. Another bonus for the evening was that it wasn't a table turning, packed to the gills event. The chefs and wait staff were very attentive and accommodating. Great experience all the way around.

Nice work team!"}
{"text":"Loved the Calamari!  And they have a great happy hour.  Plan to stop here before or after the movie"}
{"text":"My girlfriend & I came in for lunch today and had a fabulous time. Brian is a true restaurateur and provided a phenomenal experience for us. Be sure to try the bread basket with the freshly prepared tomatoes. We will surely be back!"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix on vacation and found this place. Seriously the best Calamari I have ever had. We tried various small plates and everything was delicious. The chef is talented. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Jeff, the owner is very involved in the day to day management and is an amazing chef. He made us a special low sugar dessert that truly hit the spot. This is an upscale venue with a down home feel. Your can't find this vibe in many 5* places. This place is it!"}
{"text":"Carbranara with blackened chicken was the best I've ever had hands down, thanks to the handsome bartender who recommended it"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Home made pasta, incredible flavor and outstanding service. Do yourself a favor and go, it will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour and thoroughly enjoyed the food and cocktails. The best bread basket I've ever had along with a great marinara sauce. Generous portions and tasty entrees completed the meal. Will definitely add this to our list."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! Our waiter was very knowledgeable and personable. The pizza, pasta and cocktails were all delicious. We will absolutely be coming back."}
{"text":"First time here after eating at their sister restaurant TEN in the same plaza. Decided to try the pizza (Pepperoni and Sausage) which had great flavor and a good size pizza for the price.
For me, a tad too much cheese and a little on the salty side but overall very good pizza.
I'll be back to try their other food."}
{"text":"Delicious! Thank you to our server Nicole. Awesome service. Definitely recommend the blueberry lemon cocktail. I'm a picky drinker and can only tolerate smooth drinks. This drink was perfection. But drink at your own risk because this thing sneaks up on you lol"}
{"text":"Nicole was incredible! Totally made me feel at home. I ordered the bucatini carbonara, and I swear I wouldn't lie to you yelp, it's like HEAVEN in your MOUTH!

Best food and best service in Biltmore. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. The chef greeted us at the door and sat us, I had the pork chop and my wife had the chicken parm. The pork chop was cooked perfectly and the polenta was incredible. My wife's chicken parm was also cooked perfectly and the pasta (which they make in house) was amazing. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wife and I ate here late January a couple of weeks after opening.  She had the margherita and loved it. The calamari app was great - as tender as Donovans. Wife had the bucatini carbonara and said it was delicious.  I had the 'meat and a little more' pizza. It could have used a little extra sauce but it had very good flavor.  Service was great."}
{"text":"As big fans of sister restaurant Ten Handcrafted, we tried Dieci last night.  Wow, what an outstanding meal!  Between four of us, we had three appetizers, Arancini (3 huge crispy on outside, moist inside risotto balls served with red and pesto sauces), basket of focaccia, Italian loaf and Parmesan lahvosh with roasted garlic bulb, marinated tomatoes and pesto sauces and maybe the best calamari ever.  Very tender, slightly breaded and crispy on outside.  Stracciatella soup was delicious.  Entrees were shrimp scampi (five huge grilled shrimp and homemade papperdelle pasta.  I had bucatini carbonara with pancetta.  It was great and my companions helped to finish it.  Zeppole dessert was also very good.  These guys are for real!  Everything is homemade.  Three appetizers, three orders of soup, four entrees, drinks and a dessert, all outstanding, for $167.  We are going back soon."}
{"text":"I'd say this place is a little gem off the beating path. Location is pretty decent. Very quiet and personable. The food is amazing. Danielle I think was my waitress and she was very friendly and helpful with a wine selection for my date. If you're looking for a nice place to sit down for a dinner with someone I would go here. You don't have to get all Hollywood for this place either! Very casual."}
{"text":"3rd time here and was super good . This time I got the shrimp scampi hands down the best in town . They even have a vegan dish for my wife and she said it was the best . So if you up for pasta try this spot ."}
{"text":"The owner Jeff takes a lot of pride in his culinary creations. Great atmosphere, servers and mixologists. We love this place and Ten and will continue to visit! Thanks for a great birthday dinner last night we thoroughly enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant I have been to in a very long time! And I am a tough critic when it comes to giving reviews. The moment we walked in and waited to be seated, we were greeted by the chef himself, he had noticed that the staff was a little busy at that exact moment and took the time to come out of the kitchen to greet us and let us know we would be seated shortly. Once seated, the waiter was very attentive and great about paying attention to detail. He confirmed our orders and made recommendations that made our experience even better. The chef came out several times to check on us and we had some great conversations. It was an absolute pleasure hearing his story and seeing the passion he has for what he does. The stracciatella soup was unlike anything I have ever had, Lasagna like Mama used to make (I can only assume as I am not Italian, LOL) and he finished us off with a fresh pot of French press coffee and hot/fresh zeppoli. It was outstanding! Two thumbs up and we will see you guys again very soon! Happy to have discovered yet another great little gem in our own back yard!"}
{"text":"This is a GREAT new Italian restaurant! Everything was excellent from start to finish. My sister in-law started with the \"Sage\" cocktail..It was very refreshing and tasty. I opted for the house white wine that our waiter recommended and I was not disappointed.
There was several items to choose from for appetizers. We decided on the Calamari which had a wonderful flavor and was cooked to perfection. We had the Bread Basket with the marinated tomatoes, roasted garlic bulb, and pesto. They were all so enjoyable and a great way to start the meal. My husband ordered the arancini appetizer which was amazing. 
Our main courses were the Pork Chops with polenta and mushrooms. My husband thought those were the best Chops that he had ever eaten. My sister in-law and I shared the incredible lasagna so that we could share a piece of tiramisu for dessert. Their tiramisu is a must! All the portions are very generous. The wait staff was outstanding. We will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Super customer service and every entree looked like art. The food was delicious! We will come here again."}
{"text":"We went for lunch. Service was great. Food was pretty good. Pasta and bread are made on site. The mussels are great."}
{"text":"The food was good but it's very difficult to find. It also took over two hours to get our pizzas and the restaurant was not crowded at all. Overall good but wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Ten, the sister restaurant of Dieci located just a few steps away at the Esplanade. Just like Ten, Dieci does not disappoint. 

Food:  The pork chop is a must try. It came with the most delicious polenta and the tastiest mix of vegetables. The chicken parm came in a hefty serving, definitely big enough for two people. The spaghetti was the perfect al dente, made in house. 

Service: Excellent as usual.

Price: Reasonable, worth it, and cheaper than most restaurants of its caliber around the area. 

We left Dieci already discussing when we would be back next."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this relatively new Italian spot at the Esplanade. It's a little tucked away but a neighbor to the Merc bar which has had some pretty good longevity. This is my neighborhood so I'm going to try everything and tonight was awesome. Greeted by the chef and a thorough explanation of the menu is always a good start. Since it's my first time here I have to try the classics. Arencini was piping hot and perfectly crusted. The sauce that came with was immaculately presented and delicious with bread. Of course the chicken parm; the best way to describe it? Homemade. Did not disappoint and I'll be back soon to try everything else. The ball and chain had the carbonara and I stole some of her pancetta. We took the tiramisu home and I'm writing this review as we are ploughing through it. Have to go she's eating my half.. well done Deici!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner Saturday night after reading the amazing Yelp reviews and Dieci definitely did not disappoint!  We shared the arancini to start and loved the creamy deliciousness of these little bites of heaven.  We decided to split the bucatini carbonara and baked rigatoni...such a great call as these dishes are complete opposites, but both so incredibly tasty!  Everything is homemade, fresh and flavorful without trying too hard.  The service was impeccable, but wish they could warm up the dining room just a little bit.  Definitely worth a visit and we're already planning our repeat visit!"}
{"text":"The best butternut squash ravioli I have ever had, hands down.  Their pesto game is also strong.  We topped off a delicious Italian dinner with perfect tiramisu.  Great service and something for everyone on the menu."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Too much to finish! Recommend the mushroom pizza and pesti bread."}
{"text":"Jeff
Is fabulous- knowledgeable, dedicated and a smart entrepreneur!  He is giving it 100% - superior service, amazing food and great wine list.  Location not intuitive-
Need more signage.
Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Sister restaurant to Ten (a huge favorite of ours), this place is also located under the AMC Esplanade theatre.   

We stopped here for drinks before while waiting to meet friends at Ten, but tonight is our first time eating here.  

We started off with the Donna Americana (a gin based fruiting concoction) and the Aviator (a gin-based blue martini type) drink.   Round 2 was the limonada and Mulo Italiano.  All the drinks were quite good, but the Donna Americana was the class of the bar.

We had the bisteca Marsala (w fresh, well cooked pasta and sautéed spinach) and crusted salmon special ( w risotto and grilled asparagus)... both were fabulous w the best part being the Marsala sauce."}
{"text":"Great food!  A bit tricky to find (as is every place in the esplanade). Nice ambiance and service. But I was really impressed with each food item. Great apps, bread, and entrees (I highly recommend the rigatoni)! Def will be back."}
{"text":"I recently visited Dieci for the 2nd time.  I don't make a habit of writing reviews after a single visit, because I know we can all have our off days.  

The restaurant is located in one of my favorite parts of the valley.  I'm glad to see The Esplanade regaining some of its former glory, and this particular establishment has much to do with it.  

The design and decor of the restaurant is modern and sophisticated, but not pretentious, still comfortably approachable. 
Both times I've been there, the guests were a diverse crowd.  That in itself, speaks volumes about the restaurant.  It's a destination for the financially affluent, as well as the gastronomically enriched \"foodies.\" 

My first visit, I was with my daughter.  She's 8, but being a foodie myself, she has a remarkably advanced palate.  We had the calamari starter, a pizza, the squash ravioli and zeppole dessert.  The service here is incomparable.  Everyone is incredibly friendly, prompt and attentive.  I've dined there on a slower day, as well as a ramped evening, and the service didn't change.  You won't ever have to search for someone to get what you need.

The food is delicious.  As I previously mentioned, on my first visit, I ordered 4 or 5 things from their menu.  All of it was plated and prepared exquisitely.  My 2nd visit was with a party of 14, and we ordered most of the menu.  I was with a group of food aficionados, so we all sampled each other's plates.  The breads on offer are epic.  The roasted garlic with oil is something I personally make at home to whet the appetites of my friends.  I again ordered the calamari, with the hot peppers.  I'll eat it every visit.  I've heard the from friends I've sent there that the mussels need to join my next order.

I believe that our group ordered every pasta dish that was available.  Each and every plate was presented beautifully, and cooked with the same attentiveness.   We had multiple appetizers, we also ordered at least one pizza.  I want to be as precise as I can be, so I will tell you, we sent our plates, boats, ramekins and baskets back to the kitchen clean and void of any scrap of food.

I really love this restaurant.  It's not old world Italian comfort food, even though they do serve lasagna.  It's a beautiful, modern,  American Italian eatery with unrivaled service and an impeccable menu.  I will be eating there, sending friends there, and entertaining clients there.  Dieci will surely remain in my rotation of favorite Phoenix eateries."}
{"text":"A New York Italian is the toughest critic for any Italian eatery. With its minimalist yet sleek atmospheric and a very fairly priced menu, this and place already rocks before you eat anything. My boyfriend and I shared the Arancini (Risotto balls) and they were some of the best I've ever had. We each had the Italian chopped salad for dinner which was too big for us each to finish. With prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, pine nuts and some chicken to add on - this salad was delicious and filling. The buttermilk basil dressing was phenomenal. Great service and a warm welcome from Brian topped off a lovely night !"}
{"text":"So sad to see Dieci closed :( Food AND service were ALWAYS fantastic. 
The entire center is 95% empty. The landlords make it impossible for any business to make it a go. All escalators have been shut down for months. No valet service either. If Morton's, Del Frisco's and Dieci can't make it...blame the landlords and owners of the center."}
{"text":"This place is MAGNIFICENT!  Fresh food super authentic and amazing service!  The menu is great and everything is so good it's hard to decide!  A great selection of wines and this place never disappoints!  If you want great authentic Italian that strives on taste, presentation and customer service, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Just finished a customer dinner at Dieci, and I was so impressed I'm actually writing a review. Arrived and everything was set up and planned. Execution and timing was beyond perfect! The food, oh my god, was sooo delicious! I was in Italy last year and this place blew me away! Best Italian food I've had in Phoenix. Looking forward to coming back and raving about it in the meantime!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food at this classic Italian. Pasta is to die for and made daily by the owners. Restaurant is pretty isolated on the ground floor of Esplanade Plaza Camelback Rd but it's well worth finding. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love Dieci! The red wine on tap and the mushroom pizza are my go-to's. Service is great with a friendly staff."}
{"text":"In an area with such incredible culinary experiences im left wondering how on earth could a place like this receive so many 5 star reviews?! The answer is it can't. 

It's not easy summarizing the lacklustre and oftentimes laughable service and product experience this establishment \"offered\" but I'll try.

When we walk in at 6.30pm the restaurant is about 1/3 full, offering several free tables. Despite that the waiter and, presumably, manager couldn't agree to which table we would be seated. Ultimately we were escorted to an unflattering table, which we thought was weird given we had made a reservation and mentioned this was our first time visiting. But no big deal.

Then started the comedy. Our waiter was an embarrassment to all professionals who take their job seriously. First we ordered drinks, my wife ordered a glass of white wine. She received a glass of red (keep in mind there were probably 15 people in the restaurant at this point, not busy. We asked them to replace the red wine with a white, and it took them 15 minutes to do that. Our clueless waiter came late to the party and tried serving the glass of white after it had already been delivered by his colleague. Meanwhile, my Figgy Cent, was nowhere to be found. It showed up at my table 30 minutes after ordered, despite a handful of reminders. The icing on the cake was another party, who came to restaurant after us where one gentleman received a Figgy Cents before myself. What the holy hell is going on, I thought! 

My party of four ended up getting each of our drinks in 5 minute intervals, which as you know is a real mood setter. Good news? Cocktail was pretty good once I got it.

The pasta was undercooked and doughey and the waiter brushed it off saying \"that's how it's supposed to be\", when it clearly was not.

We ended up leaving the restaurant early, almost in disbelief of what had happened. Maybe they had an off day, maybe there was something else going on. But I'll never go back and won't recommend it to others."}
{"text":"The food and handcrafted cocktails at this place are really good.  All the pasta is made from scratch on-site and veg is locally sourced.  Started with the combo dipping sauces for the bread.  Really good!  Had the caprese...also delicious.  Had the seasonal butternut squash ravioli.  Delicious!  Wife had the Ono fish with a side of butternut squash and noodles.  It was really good.  Friends split a Margherita pizza and it was so fresh and delicious.  The staff was very friendly.  Would definitely go back to the place.  Only issue we had was as the restaurant got busier the two servers struggled to maintain drink refills or even asking if we wanted dessert or coffee (we just got the check)."}
{"text":"The carbonara pasta was amazing!! Also the mushroom pizza was soo bomb.com!!! Definitely coming back realllll soon to try the rest!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Honest Italian American dishes.  It doesn't get any better than this.  The special boneless pork chop was divine.  Would have never ordered it but the waiter suggested it and we weren't sorry.  The chicken parm.... the benchmark for any Italian restaurant was the best I've had.  The chicken was juicy and flavorful, not overly seasoned and the marinara was perfectly proportioned to the delicious house made pasta that accompanied the dish.  You cannot miss the arancini (fried risotto), which was absolutely decadent as an app but could easily serve as a meal.  My husband and I found our new fave Italian restaurant and, yes it worth the drive from North Scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"My son found Diece while searching restaurants in Phoenix's Biltmore area where we enjoy frequenting when visiting the Valley of fire. We are already big fans of Ten which is located in the same complex but we were not aware it has an Italian sister!  We were full of anticipation and we were not disappointed. We were ecstatic! Owner Jeff was roaming around looking more like an employee. He came over to our table to chat when I recognized him from Ten.  He is always very forthcoming, friendly and interesting. We learned that his wife is Italian which was largely responsible for the birth of this sister restaurant.

According to my mother in law who was born in southern Italy and was with us, the clams they serve are the best she's ever had and believe me, she's had a lot of clams over 7 decades in both Italy and America.  While I have hadn't as many, I would have to agree.  They were fantastic and this appetizer would make a wonderful meal by itself.

The rest of our food was extraordinary.  Freshly prepared.  Beautifully plated and presented.  No pretension.  No fluff.  Just authentic Italian fare.

I just read that Dieci closed since our visit a couple of months ago.  That's very disappointing news but I am glad we got to try it at least once."}
{"text":"We stopped in for the Tiramisu, which I heard was amazing. I have a long intimate history with all things pastry and I have to say this WAS the best Tiramisu I have had in my 47 yrs.  The table next to us had the mussels- and that is the first thing I will get next time I go here! Service is superb and the Chef/owner is a doll. Will be regulars here now!"}
{"text":"BRIAN the server is AMAZING! Anything he offers just say YES. He recommended two cocktails that were incredible! The lasagna was brilliant! He's so lively and uplifting thank goodness we still have servers like Brian! I love the paintings on the wall with the vibe of the music playing in the background. The music plays in but its not blanketing! My boyfriend loved the Pork chop! Please come it's phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Dieci. Where do I begin. 

The Arancini balls are to die for. When I say, the two times I've been here I have wanted to order them in bulk, that is an understatement. 

I want to order five orders of these balls for takeout and eat it all for dinner. It is worth the trip just for these balls. 

On to equally important things, the service has always been amazing, the ambience is calm, and it's never too crowded for dinner. However, they do accept reservations - which is highly recommended for lunch time. 

This restaurant is slowly but surely becoming a regular for my girlfriend and I every time we want a nice night out. 

I highly recommend the Arancini balls."}
{"text":"For dinner on Monday. Very quiet with no waiting time. Very friendly staff. We had a Fried Calamari (excellent). Pork Chops (juicy  and huge portions with polenta) and a Rigatoni pasta (big portion and excellent meat sauce). Very reasonable price. Honest food. Will be back when in Biltmore."}
{"text":"This review is much delayed.  However, WE LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Not only is the food fresh and homemade but the service is amazing.  My husband and I have been here a few times and have never been disappointed.  I'm hesitant to write this since it's nice going to a restaurant on a Saturday night that's not packed, but please check them out.  Just don't eat carbs for a couple weeks and you'll be good."}
{"text":"My vegetarian girlfriend and I had dinner here on what we were told by our server was the first night the restaurant was open, and I could not believe it! Everything about the experience was fantastic - from being welcomed as we opened the front door to being thanked for joining them as we left. The food, the service, the drinks, the ambiance -- all home runs. We started with their selections of bread along with tomato and basil to dip and enjoy along with three unique Italian breads. We then shared the caprese salad, which was colorful, amazingly flavorful, and the mozzarella in the salad was flat out insane! It is the type of salad that even if you hated tomatoes and mozzarella cheese you would fight to the death for the last bite! My girlfriend enjoyed the seasonal ravioli with butternut squash, pine nuts and finished with a brown butter that was off the charts! She had to poke my hand with her fork a few times so I would stay focused on my rigatoni, which by the way, was incredible. Incredible. Then, to close things out, we ordered the tiramisu. This was so light and perfect, and could have fed a small army. Top to bottom, this place was on point! I have been in the food and beverage industry for some time, so I appreciate when a night out is great - but will extremely critical when things don't go so well. This restaurant has a great team -servers, bartenders and a very talented kitchen; all adding up to a joint you need to visit soon. And on top of everything, you don't feel like you're wallet was stolen as you walk back to your car. Nice job, dieci!"}
{"text":"I was craving Italian food, and there'd been some recently mixed reviews about a place I'd enjoyed on my last visit, so I set out for Dieci. It's in the Esplanade, which is this not-quite-mall that is largely deserted except for a large AMC. There are a few restaurants, though, and Dieci is one of them. It's comfortable, and service was excellent.

I began with the house salad (technically, a small, but it was still pretty substantial), which was tasty and well put together. I then moved on to chicken parmesan, which came on a bed of house-made spaghetti. In addition to the expected sauce/cheese, there was also a drizzle of balsamic, which took a little getting used to, but on the whole, everything was very tasty. Portions were plentiful (I think I left a spoonful of spaghetti just so that I'd feel less guilty when I went for gelato after), and the food was definitely quality. I'd certainly return if I were back in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is a classy yet inexpensive fine dining restaurant that was a small establishment to accommodate for a large party. My guests enjoyed this restaurant and the large portions. The bread and pasta were to die for and the waitressing staff were just darling"}
{"text":"Just got back from Italy, I wasn't expecting much from Italian restaurant in US, but I was wrong.

Amazingly good food, I couldn't stop smiling from each bite I took.

Started my lunch with caprese. First bite of mozzarella, nothing... but after chewing a few more times, wonderfully amazing flavor overwhelmed inside my mouth. It almost taste like 100% fat fresh milk from grass fed cows. Rich and and so creamy, milk flavor bursted inside my mouth.

Carbonara served here is a must have! Pasta had this perfect texture to it, so rare to experience this al dente textures around, I thought I could eat another plate of pasta. It was that good.

Mushrooms pizza used some kind of oil that mixed well with mushrooms and went so well with vinaigrette. Whatever the oil they sprinkled, enhanced flavor of pizza.

Tiramisu was a bit dry for my liking. I don't think I would try again. Service was not that fast either, but food was so good, I still rate this place 5 stars.

Parking validation is available. Just ask your server for it."}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch and it was excellent. I had the mussels and my husband had the grinder. It was enough for lunch and we had no leftovers. We can't wait to come back and try some of the dinner fare. Sarah was excellent and so much fun."}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING.  My boyfriend and I were visiting from Seattle and tried this place based on reviews. We started with the arachini and then split the Italian chopped salad - both were perfect. I had the carbonara and my boyfriend had a steak special - they were well seasoned and delicious. The servings were generous so if you're not starving you might split an entree. Our server was sweet and attentive. Will definitely go back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Moved to Arizona from Boston and have had a hard time finding good Italian food. Stumbled upon this place because of the great ratings it got, and boy did it not disappoint. 
From the moment we walked in the door we were treated like family. The staff was wonderful, Brian, Katie, and Jeff made the experience outstanding. 
Brian's vast knowledge of the menu and true passion for this restaurant really shows. 
We started with the bread combo. Oh my what flavors. The marinaded tomatoes were by far my favorite but the pesto is out of this world too. The bread is warm and super fresh. All three kinds are so different but each equally delicious. We also got the arancini balls. They were good, not the greatest I've ever had but good, would definitely get them again. The sauce they sit on had a little spice in it, not a lot but just gave it a little more flavor. We did find ourselves dipping the bread in that as well. 
We ordered a couple drinks from their cocktail menu. I forget what my mother got but she loved it. I got the sage, which was light and very flavorful. 
For dinner I wanted chicken Marsala but that wasn't on the menu, so Brian had the chef make me a specialty plate. The fact they would take the time to accommodate my request was amazing. It did turn out superb. My mom ordered the bucatini carbonara which was phenomenal. The little pieces of pancetta and that cream sauce it's mixed in was a dream. 
After sitting for a little while and digesting we decided to try dessert. The staff all raved about the zeppolis, so we ordered them. To us they weren't that spectacular. The sauce they came with was good, a little too sweet, and for me to say that is crazy because I love sweets. And I felt the zeppolis were a little harder than I would've liked. Brian insisted on us trying the tiramisu so we would leave in a good note. FYI tiramisu is not a favorite of mine at all. I didn't take a picture of it but it was huge and beautiful. The flavor was also phenomenal, they nailed it. Probably the best I've ever had, hands down. 
All in all this place is a must. It's a hidden gem. Once the word gets out about this place you'll be lucky to get a table. Great Italian food that makes you feel like you're dining with family. I look forward to many future visits."}
{"text":"Really great Italian food- the fried risotto is amazing.  Happy hour is well worth it.  Great service - very attentive!"}
{"text":"First time here and not disappointed! We were attended immediately & our glasses of water were never empty throughout our entire time there. The bread is delicious and fresh. The main course was out in a very short time, served by the very talented kitchen staff themselves. Honestly, I took my boyfriend out to eat here because of the amazing reviews on Yelp and was a bit worried, but I am so happy I did. Did I mention their taste in music is close to perfection? I thought it would be traditional Italian music or some Andrea Bocelli (not that there's anything wrong with that) but it was not and was pleasantly surprised the restaurant to be accompanied by new music that went perfect with the entire scenery of this place. 

If you're worried about parking, don't. They will validate your ticket for you! 

DEFINITELY coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service and definitely the place to be for lunch or dinner! This is the newest restaurant from the same owner as Ten (which is also amazing) and it does not disappoint. If you are craving Italian food and looking for a new place to try out, you just found it at Dieci!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent meal here! The house made margarita was perfect and they had wine on tap too! Calamari and caprese salad were good but the star of the show was the Bucatini Carbonara! Pasta was perfectly cooked and I hope to eat here again soon!!"}
{"text":"This is really good Italian American food. Their red sauce is exactly how it should be, the best I've had in Arizona. Try the mussels. Service was exceptional and the chef was on point. I'll be back again real soon."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! Visited Dieci after visiting Italy just within 2 weeks! It gave me hope for delicious authentic Italian food in the US. We had a halibut special over a salad that was mind-blowing. The portion was huge (just like food was in Italy). Service was friendly and quick!!! The tiramisu was to die for and to be shared... crazy huge portion to share but I loved every bite. Looking forward to returning!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and wine. Restaurant seems light on decor and ambience but the food, service and wine were perfect."}
{"text":"Probably as close to Fresh Italian pasta as you can get. My first time here. Took my parents...also food critics. My mom got the chicken parm. She loved the crispy chicken texture and moist chicken. The potions are enough to share. My dad ordered the pasta and marinara sauce. The pasta was al dente and delicious flavor. Very fresh. 
I ordered the carbonara. It was a perfect mix of favor, texture and portion. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Wednesday for happy hour before catching a movie upstairs. Very nice looking modern restaurant. 

We sat at the bar and ordered two cocktails and the meat and cheese tray. Gin martini for me, excellent! Cosmopolitan for my friend, also excellent. 

The meat and cheese board was really good. We enjoyed everything on it and it was quite large!  It was also on sale for happy hour!  Great deal! 

I can't wait to come back to have lunch or dinner.  

I am worried about the success of this place because at 6:30 on a Wednesday night, it was empty. There was one table of four seated and we were the only ones at the bar. It's really in a tough location, unfortunately the entire Esplanade is lacking in traffic besides the theater. 

I wish them much success!  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Best chicken parmesan I've ever had! And my husband loved the lasagna!! Can't wait to go back. Yum!"}
{"text":"Natalie was our server, and she is? amazing!  She was super busy, but made us feel like we were her only customers. Everything is delicious. Ordered the mussels and bread combo for apps, and will get that every time I visit from here forward. The tapenade and pesto are yummy! The salad is chopped! I appreciate that I didn't have to cut up my own lettuce in my salad. It is dressed perfectly with their house made basil buttermilk dressing. 

We ordered the shrimp scampi. To be fair, the pasta was perfectly al dente, but under-sauced in my opinion. Super-fresh pasta, but I craved more of that beautiful sauce.  Once we tossed it a few more times, it was better.  Honestly, the red pepper flakes were just not needed in my opinion, although my husband would beg to differ.

Tiramisu is to die for...

Funny thing is, my husband was winging it on Valentine's Day (we forgot to make reservations until last minute). Home run!"}
{"text":"So many things on the menu....so little time! My husband and I have dined at Dieci several times. Never disappointed. We always like to try something new. We have yet to dislike anything! Chef Jeff is a master in the kitchen. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Met the owner who was extremely personable and accommodating. The fresh made pasta was amazing.  Great service and amazing food.  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great atmosphere, awesome service. Can't go wrong with Dieci! They also have delicious drinks and it's close to the movie theater. I recommend their Caprese appetizer and their bread"}
{"text":"Dieci, tucked away in the unusually quiet Esplanade plaza, sits directly across the street from the much more lively Biltmore Fashion Park. The restaurant itself, previously housed the lackluster Solo Trattoria before they ended up closing shop.

The area, at least in the evenings, seems very dead - as has always been the case. In some ways, I expected Dieci to be a similar experience to what we had during its \"Solo days\" and was mostly correct in my assumptions.

It's mainly a traditional American-Italian restaurant that makes all of their pasta from scratch. During prime dining hours on Thursday night, aside from a couple at the bar that were finishing up, my girlfriend and I were the only ones in the entire restaurant. 

We started with a bread basket, which included a combination of three breads (focaccia, Italian loaf, and black pepper lavosh). You can then choose your dips/spreads. We opted for marinated tomatoes, pesto, and tapenade (which is basically pureed olives). This was mostly standard-fare stuff, with nothing really being particularly memorable of the lot.

Additionally, we ordered the arancini, which are fried risotto balls. Again, this is something we've had at many Italian restaurants and isn't really anything remarkably different than what can be obtained elsewhere. They were fine.

My girlfriend suggested a pizza, but I quickly reminded her that she should know better based on our past failures. Experience has taught us that any Italian restaurant that tacks pizza onto the menu rarely delivers in an area that's best left to the wood-fired specialists throughout The Valley. 

For pastas, we ordered the baked rigatoni, which tasted a bit dry, but not too bad. We also ordered what's referred to as the \"Ravioli of the Season,\" which consists of three raviolis with butternut squash and some brown butter. I've had something very similar to this at another Italian place within walking distance and just felt that it wasn't quite comparable. Or maybe we've just become too damned spoiled.

We opted to skip dessert, as their only two options, tiramisu and zeppole, are pretty much found in every Italian restaurant. I seriously doubt either would have blown us away.

Honestly, I don't want to be too harsh on this place. I mean, the server was friendly and the food was by no means bad. It was just standard Italian food that seems kind of pointless in an area that's already surrounded by some extremely popular Italian joints that would easily chew this place up whole and spit them out if they're not careful.

I doubt we'd come back, but I'd still suggest giving them a fair shot. But based on our various dining experiences, I just don't get the five-star reviews.

Sorry!"}
{"text":"I am confused as to why this place is so highly rated.  It was pretty terrible.  I had the sausage and pepperoni pizza.  It was really bland and not crispy at all.  My wife had the ravioli.  It was pretty terrible as well.  

Positive note, the wine was good and the service was good.  That being said, not enough for me to come back."}
{"text":"If you like fresh pasta, then you have to check out Dieci!

We came on a Saturday night and sat in the bar so we could watch the basketball game.  We had multiple servers come by to check in on us, and once we ordered and they realized we were sharing dishes, they even offered to split it for us in the back!  Quite a lovely offer, and we took them up on it which made our dining experience just that much sweeter. Also, the chef/owner made sure come by for a chat so it was nice to have him come by to ensure that everything was beyond satisfactory. The attention to details at service was definitely more than we had expected and was greatly appreciated.

And on top of that, the food was fantastic!  We split the Italian Chopped salad and the Bucatini Carbonaro and they were both incredible.  The Italian Chopped had such a nice combination of flavors from the fresh prosciutto, mozzarella and basil-buttermilk dressing, that I'm craving it again just thinking about it.  Also, the pasta was absolute perfection!! You don't see bucatini pasta all that often in this town, and this was sensational all the way around.  The carbonara sauce was to die for, nice chunks of pancetta and peas, and the pasta itself was the perfect vessel to soak up all that loveliness.  

If you're in the area and looking for a lovely dining experience with quality, scratch-made food, then Dieci is your spot!! :)"}
{"text":"Love this place. Indoor seating or outdoor. Friendly staff. Food very good. The strata mia cocktail is forward and not too sweet, perfect for Friday evening. The pork chop with risotto melted in my mouth and the tiramisu is house made, soaked in tequila and espresso, and ample portion. The flat bread appetizer filling in itself. The outdoor music needs a little adjustment."}
{"text":"Was out in AZ for business, born and raised in the Bronx on Arthur Ave and this hidden gem rivals any authentic Italian food you'll find."}
{"text":"What a find! Carbonara coma! And the house salad with basil buttermilk. Yummmm. Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"The homemade pasta (made from their $$$ machine from Italy) was amazing!! We had the carbonara and seasonal butternut squash ravioli and both were delish! Highly recommend! Great happy hour ($3 for all beers and $3 off a lot of the wine and cocktails and half off apps) too. :)"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant tonight! Wow! The best Italian food I have ever had in Arizona. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Great Service and Amazing Food! Staff goes above and beyond to accommodate off menu requests!!! Tiramisu is Delish, save room!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here on a whim before our movie. What a treat! We had the chicken chopped salad and charcuterie board. Both were amazing flavors and served quickly. The staff was on point and the owner came and greeted us and even offered a money back guarantee if we didn't like our cocktails. The Venetian cocktail was amazeballs. I am a margarita snob. I don't order well liquor and I don't order well margaritas or ones with triple sec. This drink was hands down one of my favorite margaritas around town! Try this place out!"}
{"text":"Calamari was a little soggy that we ordered, and the pesto based pasta dish lacked flavor / zest. While the staff was nice, I would not come back here."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try the brother to Ten Handcrafted and it didn't disappoint! I had the pork chops and my husband had the baked rigatoni and they were fabulous. Bretton the bartender makes you feel right at home and makes a great cocktail! BTW, going to be offering gluten-free pasta soon - can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Service is top notch. Chef delivered our food and said \"hello\" - super friendly guy. He's also the chef/owner at Ten (a few doors down).

Started with Caprese salad and simple salad. The small simple salad is 'uge. Caprese has *real* tasty tomatoes. We were off to a great start. 

My husband had the rigatoni - he said it was to die for. 
I had the chicken parm (I'm somewhat of an expert on this dish). Plump piece of chicken breast (unlike the usual flattened, dry filet). Plenty of pasta with a light tomato sauce and parmesan. I'd give it a 4 out of 5 (which, is a high mark from me for this particular dish). 

We accompanied dinner with a bottle of the Penfolds Shiraz. Yum.

Overall: excellent, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Not open until 10:00. Showed up at 8:50, because I'm considerate, and they stopped serving for the night. I understand that summer hours change, but please inform patrons if they do."}
{"text":"On a Tuesday night (?) Why not ??? We got the chef, Jeff, attention! Sum it up, food was absolutely delicious. Our waiter (Seth) was really friendly & helpful. Fresh air with gorgeous weather in the patio, not to overlook the hip and chic decors inside with a modernizing concept bar. Chef came out for a casual chat, it was definitely a nice & personal touch - learning a few new things about food, restaurant business, and the future in the area & Jeff's vision.
We were inspired !"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  I had dinner at Dieci earlier this week with two friends.  We started off with cocktails.  We all had the same drink--something with pear vodka that was different and delicious!  Then we had bread and pesto.  We all had pasta dishes for entrees.  One friend had the Carbonara.  It was delicious, but a little heavier on the garlic than I would have expected from that dish.  Another friend had the Rigatoni.  It was great as well, smothered in cheese, and the meat was delicious.  I had the Shrimp Scampi--WOW!  The presentation was beautiful.  The tagliatelle was cooked perfectly, and it had 5 large shrimp and a delicious sauce.  I will return time and time again for that dish!  Finally, the service was great.  Our server was very attentive and personable, and one of the owners talked to us a couple of times.  I'm so glad to have found another great restaurant in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Homemade pasta and great customer service, definitely give this place a try. Huge portions and everything we tried was delicious. Kind of off the beaten path, but worth it."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I drove all the way from California to have a peaceful mini vacation. He just loves nature, peaceful and quiet. We decided to make dinner reservations at this restaurant and I have to say it's the best dining experience I've had so far! Our waiter provided excellent service, I didn't catch his name, and the food was amazing! I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim because we were in the area. Planned on a couple cocktails and an appetizer. Ended up staying here for the full meal because everything was to die for! Definitely recommend the meat and cheese board, caprese salad, shrimp scampi and WINE!!!! :) can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has some of the best service I have ever come across. The owner of the restaurant is also the chef...he was very nice, helpful, accommodating and friendly! The food is all made fresh daily and to the order, even the pasta is made from a machine that has been flew in from Italy !! Come check this place out!!! Definitely coming back for the food and the service !!"}
{"text":"First impression, for a 4 1/2 star restaurant, on a Friday night, why is it so empty? We were sat on a high top and given menus, a couple of which had food stains encrusted on them. It's fine. The place is cute and the wait staff seems friendly. Besides that, this place has 4 1/2 stars so it must be exceptional. We order the bread basket and the waiter/ bartender Breton ( not sure how to spell that) explains how you're supposed to smoosh the garlic and spread it on your bread. I reach past it and grab one of the biscotti looking breads and it's delicious. I'm fairly sure given the chance I probably would have had 10. So we order wine and peruse the menu. I order chicken parm, which is my go to when I hit up Italian restaurants. My friend orders chicken pesto sandwich with pasta salad and our other friend orders rigatoni.  I'm going to be honest with my chicken parm, I can make it just as good, if not better at home. The other food is deemed to be good, but not enough to ever make the 40 minute drive out again. Breton was a fantastic waiter, even went the extra mile and picked food out of my friend's hair. He made cute jokes like saying their bathroom required a key that is attached to a hanger, that we would be safe from vampires after the garlic food we consumed, and some other quips that made our night. So, do I think this place deserves 4 1/2 stars? Probably not, the food seems it a 3 1/2, 4 at the MOST. But it's a cute spot and the staff treated us really well."}
{"text":"One word.... Yesss!!!

This is my second time here and I absolutely love this place! The ambience is on point, the staff are always extremely friendly.  The chef/owner Jeff is one bad ass chef and amazingly friendly.  He sat us right away when we walked in and made sure we were taken care of for the entire evening.  Seth was our server, and he was awesome period.  Very knowledgeable, sold us on deserts when we weren't even hungry.  

On tonight's menu:

*Pork Chop - Polenta, Wild mushrooms (very savory), Porcini Oil  

**officially the second person to hug the chef after him coming to ask how our entrees were!**

Cocktail:

The Sage - Plymouth Gin, Averna, Lime, Rasberry, Orgeat, Sage Syurp (very refreshing, excellent summer cocktail)

Strada Mia (OMG) - Redemption Rye, Bravo Spirits Amaro #4, Storico Cocchi, Vermouth di Torino

Dessert:

Zeppole - Cinnamon sugar, luxardo amaretto anglaise

For those of you who read my reviews, you know that I am a old fashion connoisseur.  This Strada Mia was incredible, full of flavor, different than an old fashion but the rye is superb.  I'm a forever customer and will come here as long as they will let me.  Please experience this place, music is great and it just has a fantastic vibe.

Cheers"}
{"text":"Idiots. 

First time visit was a bust. Read on...

My wife made a birthday reservation for us at 6:30 pm tonight (May 10th). 

Excited to try this place. Sadly we walked up to the door and discover that the place was closed because of a \"plumbing issue.\"

They had our phone number - but no one apparently gave a crap. Why is it so hard to be professional and follow up? The manager or owner did see me and my family outside - all bewildered as to WHY no one even had the professionalism and caring attitude to CALL us! My wife told them it was my birthday. 

You lost us. Service matters. Maybe business is so good that you don't need the business, but somehow I doubt it as the esplanade isn't a hot evening location.

*** Another reason to stay away? Just discovered the owners FAR right wing political views: 
https://www.eventbrite.com/e/book-signing-chris-buskirk-seth-leibsohn-american-greatness-tickets-35829821962#

So we ended up getting back in the car and had an INCREDIBLE & DELICIOUS meal across the street at Hillstone! Food was so solid there. In the end it was fortuitous as it made for a far better birthday there than in a sleepy/empty Italian restaurant in a quite deserted business building.

***UPDATE: NOW I UNDERSTAND THE REASON THE PLACE WAS \"CLOSED\" THE NIGHT WE WERE THERE. GOING OUT OF BUSINESS, KAPUT, DONE."}
{"text":"This is a trendy restaurant with a combination of Italian or American food. Handcrafted drinks are their specialty."}
{"text":"Amazing  service. Fun  and  great  food.  Dog  friendly  patio.  I  love  everything  about  Dieci!  thx  Jason  and  Nathalie  for  a  great  first  experience! and  the tiramisu  OMG!"}
{"text":"No major complaints about this place! Drinks comprised of the Figgy Cent and Italian Stallion and both were finished before we realized it, it was that good. The bread was accompanied by flavorful dips of pesto, olive, and garlic. The calamari had jalapeños and bell pepper and was fried to perfection. The rigatoni and carbonara were delicious...wishes we could've finished it all! The bartender was surprised that me and my girl friend ordered so much food and that was a bit off-putting but nothing to ruin the taste of the chefs' skills!"}
{"text":"Food were amazingly  delicious!!! Im soooo in Love with Calamari !Staffs were awesome"}
{"text":"Excellent! Owner / chef served us. Great service and great food. Can't wait to try his other restaurant  10!"}
{"text":"What a delicious hidden gem!!  A neighbor told me about this place as I would have never known from the road, despite driving past the area almost daily!  A true locally owned business, with Chef Jeff & family who owns and puts all their pride and joy in the business.  The chef came out to see how we liked our food, which I love.  Danielle, our server was fantastic.  We shared the Carbonara (incredible & RICH!) and the risotto special... to die for!!  Parmesan risotto, grilled shrimp, smoked scallops, grilled asparagus and a roasted red pepper carrot puree.  INCREDIBLE!!!  We shared a fresh, yummy salad as servings are hefty to share or delicious for left overs.  We had homemade tiramisu for dessert... 4 people could eat and get a buzz from the amount of brandy in it!  A few bites of this is all I need.  I will definitely be back with friends and family, and it was worth the splurge on gluten, sugar, dairy and wine!  I will also try their other restaurant in the same plaza, TEN."}
{"text":"While planning my girlfriends birthday party of 20, we had to make a last day change of venue and contacted Brian at Dieci.  From the moment we made first contact until the time we left, Jeff, Brian, and the entire staff went above and beyond our expectations. In addition to the restaurant being open and inviting, the staff is attentive to the smallest of details, the food is outstanding, and overall it is probably one of the best values for fine dining in Phoenix.  The location is a little tricky to find if you're not familiar with the area, but your search is well worth making a trip to this outstanding restaurant!  Well done Jeff, Brian, and everybody at Dieci!"}
{"text":"Absolute love for this place! Great food, great atmosphere, love the people! Perfect for a relaxing happy hr where you can laugh and great place to take clients for a lunch meeting."}
{"text":"Took another couple and we had a GREAT time.  The wait staff were all great and friendly and very proud of their new restaurant.  We enjoyed our signature cocktails and we had a couple appetizers before our main entrees.  The calamari was different and very interesting.  We loved the flavor.  Definitely a repeat over and over.  GO try it out you will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Not so much, this time. Maybe the difference is day of week. Last time they were packed to the walls.

Weekday evening this time. Prime dining hour. Place was very, very quiet.

We were greeted quickly with smiles and told to pick a table. I managed to pick the most wobbly table in the place but we survived. A dirty fork in my set up was quickly replaced and apologized for.

Entrees came piping hot and as ordered. However, they are not \"stand out\" from any other good Italian restaurant in town factoring in price to the equation.

Service was friendly. Should have offered up dessert. We'd have ordered zeppole (loved it last time) but we don't order unless we're asked. Cost the tab and the tip. Saved me the calories.

Other restaurants are equally good and not nearly as hard to get to (unless you are already there). Has to be a tough location to make work.

For me:
food 3.5-4 stars
service 4 stars
location 1.5 stars"}
{"text":"Im an Italian whose lived in NY and can count on 1 hand good Italian restaurants in Phoenix. Dieci's one of them. You can't go wrong all the meals our table ordered were great!"}

This food is literally to die for! The Chef is amazing and he comes out to make sure you are happy with his dishes. The look on his face says it all, he truly cares what you think of his place along with every bite you eat.  All the staff is wonderful but my personal favorite is hands downs Katie! She will tell you what to try, help you maneuver the menu and talk you into the most incredible homemade Tiramisu you've ever had.  Again, obsessed"}
{"text":"I was sad when Solo Trattoria closed. Now that Dieci's open, I'm less sad. The service is fantastic. Katie, especially, is worth singling out. I called down to Dieci from my office to order a pizza for a later time. To my surprise, when she said it'd be ready at 11:40 (like I asked), she wasn't lying! My pizza came out hot and ready at 11:40. Nice! She also said it would be packed with love, which, clearly it was. 

I got the Ends With a Vowel pizza, which is sausage and pepperoni. Delicious! 

Recommended, especially for a business lunch."}
{"text":"The food was descent but the service was not particularly good. 1 wait person for the entire restaurant, (who by the way did not have a clue about the wine list even though she said she was extensively trained on it!), does not bode well for excellent service. The pasta and chicken Parmesan were very tasty. However, the pizza tasted like something from Pappa Johns. Will probably not return."}
{"text":"After receiving a thoughtful note from this business's owner, I decided to give Dieci another try sooner than I may have otherwise (props to good business owners who know how to talk to customers!). I decided to go to Dieci for my birthday dinner with my family (second bday dinner actually, with the first being at Ten a couple days before....lol) and let me tell you..... Dinner here was a whole different ball game than hh. It was amazing! Everyone got something different, so I got to try many menu items.... There was not one bad bite! We started with their 'ends in a vowel' pizza.... This thing was legit. My mom said she would come back for that pizza alone, and I have to agree. It had the perfect savory flavor... The meats were crispy and a little spicy and the sauce tasted homemade (you know, in a good way). In fact, this restaurant makes most (all?) Of their sauces/dressings in house.... They even make their psta in house (or at least they do for the lasagna). 

Speaking of lasagna.... Their lasagna was legit. I LOVE a good lasagna, but it's harder to find than you'd think. This lasagna was 8 layers (I think) and had Bolognese sauce, ricotta cheese...even a layer of basil. It was fabulous. The husband got chicken parmesan and said it was the best chicken parm he's had in Phoenix. Their meatballs were awesome, the pesto chicken was super flavorful.... It was all good.

 I also have to give them credit for keeping their prices reasonable. The pastas cost around 15$, the pizza was closer to 12$ (and it was not tiny), the sandwiches were also about 12$ and came with a side.... We're talking reasonable, especially for the quality. 


Did someone say tiramisu? They should have.... This place has insane tiramisu. The slice we got was ginormous... Thank god we had 5 people to eat it. It was so good.... It did not suffer from any of the typical tiramisu downfalls (too dry, not enough espresso flavor, too wet and soggy, etc). It was fantastic!


So go friends....visit this restaurant.... Maybe hit up Ten for hh and then come here for dinner, you won't be sad!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Tucked away among the office buildings. A treasure worth finding. Chef is personable and talked with us about more than food things. Server also a great   conversationalist.  Food tasty! Had mussels and shared carbonara. The tomato sauce for mussels incredible and portion-huge.  Carbonara was rich with right amount of bacon and peas. Guided to right red wine.  Martini was exceptional with right amount of ice crystals.  Totally recommend. We drove over from Tempe area and worth the drive."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical as the restaurant was empty when I walked in, but I am so glad i stayed.  I had the pork chop with polenta and it was the best one I have had in years. Juicy with mushrooms on top and creamy polenta that was mouth watering. Staff was friendly and fun. Great experience and would go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"I tried this place again and can report back that other items on the menu are better than the salad I previously ordered.  I really like the stracciatella soup (chicken broth, spinach, egg).  It's simple but filling and delicious.  It usually comes with cheese mixed into the broth, but they were able to make me some without cheese which I really appreciated.  I would definitely order that soup again, and it matches well with the simple salad for a healthy and fresh lunch."}
{"text":"Came here last night and definitely enjoyed our visit!  Service was great (our server definitely had a sense of humor), the setting is pleasant and quiet, and the food was delicious.  Unfortunately, they were out of mussels when we came (and we were so excited to try them!), but the calamari appetizer was outstanding.  The arancini was superb (loved the combo of red sauce and pesto that came with it).  They also have a fun wine list - we ended up sharing a bottle of the Wild Horse Cab, which I had tried before at Coup Des Tartes downtown, and our group liked it so much that we ended up getting a second bottle.

Meal-wise, Mark H. and I split the lasagna and the recommended bucatini carbonara.  I loved the carbonara, but I think I might skip out on the lasagna next time and try something else.  It was good, but nothing special, and I have family members who make similar or better lasagna dishes.  One of our friends had the shrimp scampi, and I think I might go for that next time - it was delicious.

Overall, great service and a fun environment to kick back and enjoy a good meal with friends."}
{"text":"Visiting my son again and lst on my list was a return visit to Dieci and Chef/Owner Jeff did not disappoint.  He actually remembered what I ordered 4 months ago (who does that)? So why spoil a good thing and I had the same thing.  I told him the one thing I would have changed from my review on 6/14/17 was if Yelp offered a 10 Star I would have given him that instead of my 5 star.  Kudo's to you Chef Jeff and your lovely staff who are also incredible.  See you on my next trip!!!!"}
{"text":"I still cannot stop talking about this place! We were in Peoria for a baseball tourney. The team wanted a team dinner, Deici was ready to help accommodate us. We almost took up the entire restaurant. We are so glad we took a chance & drove out to the restaurant. The restaurant ambiance was beautiful, upscale & welcoming. We loved it from entering the place. We were treated so well, they didn't seem to mind we had 15 children with us. All of us parents wanted a good meal with a nice cocktail, we soon realized we had definitely come to the rt place. 

From the get go, they helped us understand the menu, all 44 of us had drinks & ready to order. We all couldn't have raved more to each other on how delicious the food was!! The timing was great, the seasoning impeccable & the service outstanding.  I forget the waitress' name but she was not only beautiful & polite but attentive!! We had found a gold mine. 

We are from OC in CA & my family & I are foodies. I love cooking & trying new restaurants. For the past month since we visited Deici I have been always referring back to this great restaurant wishing there was one here locally! 

Every dish we got was raved over! I personally tried the local beers plus the chicken Parmesan & my oh my it was delicios. And let me tell you I don't even like Italian!! So go figure! I had fallen for this place hook, line & sinker! 

Anyhow, to all you local Arizonians, TRY THIS PLACE!! 

Tell them Ana with SC REBELS from LA sent you. Lol! 

I can't wait to get back!"}
