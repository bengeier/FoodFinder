{"text":"Absolutely fantastic.    Great food, great atmosphere and a friendly attentive chef. 

Thanks for another awesome meal"}
{"text":"FOOD: Simple 2 page menu of appetizers, pastas, risottos, and mains (meat or seafood), with a good selection of wine. I had the mussels to start with the seafood risotto to follow. Everything was delicious! Especially try the tira-mi-su which was soaked in lots of coffee/rum goodness!  

SERVICE: slooooooooooow. We also couldn't figure out who was our actual waiter because we were served by about 5 different people. They must have realized we got bored of waiting because dessert was on the house. 

COST: About $10-15 for appetizer, $15-20 for pasta or risotto and $20-30 for main. Good portion sizes though. 

OVERALL: A classic italian restaurant with very tasty food. Simple and sufficient choices to satisfy whatever italian cravings you are having that day. Easy to find (queensway at royal york) with paid parking in the back (pay for at least 1.5 hours to ensure you have enough time to wait, I mean, eat). And if there's too long a wait, maybe try next door (another italian restaurant)."}
{"text":"Posticino is a cute little Italian restaurant easily accessible in south Etobicoke. While its choice of interior decor is both interesting and, well, Italian, (think wine bottles and paintings of nude females), this is a restaurant to come for the food.
I have been to this restaurant 3 times, first ordering a delicious plate of pasta with spicy sausage and creamy cheese melted straight into the sauce, a beautifully rare steak with blue cheese and pistachios crumbled over top the second time, and the third the veal marsala as part of a group set menu.

Service here can be slow. On a busy night be prepared to wait at least 20-30 minutes to be seated. Good waitstaff is hit or miss.

While they have a party room which holds 18, my 3rd visit was as part of a large group of over 20. Only 1 waiter was assigned to us, as well as the bar we assumed, and after having to double-check all of our orders not once, but TWICE, 2 orders were somehow still completely missed. 
All in all: good food, bad service. Swing by on a date night when you aren't in a rush to stop gazing in your partners eyes."}
{"text":"I came here for a rehearsal dinner while in town and had a lovely experience. The owner Tony and his staff took great care of us. The shared appetizers and desserts were delicious! Not too big, but just enough to tide over until entrees were served. I got the Vodka Rigatoni, and it was fabulous. I was sold as soon as I read it was a vodka cream sauce and had pancetta in it. Yum!

This restaurant has a lot of significance to our family as my late grandfather was a regular there. It means a lot to us when we can go there and enjoy a great meal like he used to. Definitely recommend to those looking for great Italian food in Etobicoke."}
{"text":"Somewhat small, narrow, dark, cozy, but traditional Italian for the most part in a good and standard way.  Maybe ten tables on each side, as the place is divided down the middle by a \"divider\" shelf with wines and solid portions that do block most of the view, at least to my recollection.  Some random artwork on the walls, nothing special, but as good an atmosphere as I would've created if I owned such a restaurant.
Service:  we were greeted immediately upon entering and brought to a table.  :)  Mind you, there were more vacant than taken, so anything less would've been bad service.  I think our server's name was mentioned at the time, but I forget.  Menus were provided immediately as well.  Didn't take long for the server to arrive and ask for our choice of drinks, when I ordered my usual white wine.  We'd hoped for the free bread and received it, as usual trying not to fill up, but did (as always).  The server was present enough during our meal to be good, but not annoying.  We did have to wait at least five full minutes or more for the bill though, when we asked for it.  I realize five minutes isn't that long, but at the time it seemed it as our section of the restaurant wasn't that packed.  (a few more tables filled up after we arrived, with the average age seeming to be around 50 or 60, and the majority appeared to be regulars/a good sign).
Food:  definitely decent.  I wouldn't go as far as to say it was excellent, because it isn't clear in my memory (writing this over a month after the fact, due to technical issues), but I do recall enjoying it enough to go back.  And isn't that the key?  Reviewing their online menu for a memory boost, I had the Caesar salad to start (always my favorite) and believe I was well satisified, although don't recall the portion size or ingredient details, etc.  The fusilli pollo was my entree, of which I also seem to remember enjoying enough to not complain about any of it.  However, I don't recall bringing home the often frequent 'doggie bag' so I am to guess that my serving size wasn't huge, but probably adequate.  Unfortunately, I cannot recall what the hubby had for his entree.  It was either the same thing as me, or his usual steak.  Since I've never been a big beef eater, I tend to ask his opinion on a scale from 1-to-10 on the steak, with 1 being worst, 10 being orgasmic.  I think again, he was definitely satisfied, and surprised by the fact that he was satisfied, after not having gone to this establishment after two+ years of living in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Just happened to be in the neighbourhood on a Wednesday night and I decided to try it out. The d√©cor is a blend of old school American Italian with some more contemporary touches, meaning plenty of Italian kitsch but cleaned up a bit. The staff are ultra friendly and talkative, so don't be in a hurry and enjoy the conversation. The wine list is excellent, naturally heavy on Italian wines, with very good regional coverage and price range.
The waiter brought me their version of gluten free bruschetta - served on cucumber slices - that was surprisingly good. Kudos on modifying a traditional dish to accommodate my dietary issues. I only had one dish - the porcini risotto - and it was very good. Unlike most mushroom risottos that use white mushrooms and then toss in a couple of the more expensive species to flavor the dish, Posticino's porcini risotto really is a porcini risotto. Deeply rich and flavourful with plenty of porcini and a hint of saffron, the flavor is fabulous. They use the steeping liquid from the porcinis to augment the risotto, turning the colour a rich chocolate brown and intensifying the flavour - mmmmmm! The only detraction is the rice itself - a little overcooked and lacking the nutty starchiness essential to the best risottos.
I look forward to returning and trying other dishes. Who knows, I might just up the mark from 4 star to 5 star on my next visit."}
{"text":"Far from being authentic Italian.  Overpriced for pasta dishes and the food is sub-par"}
{"text":"Snugged on the queensway is this quaint italian restaurant. For my fiancees birthday we wanted to try something local and support our neighbourhood. Having been on the queensway many times, we always walked by posticino but never had an urged to try until recently. Upon entering you're greeted by a super friendly host. Even on a Monday night the restaurant was busy! As we sat down, one server immediately came to our attention and poured us a nice cold glass of water.   The restaurant itself can seat probably 20 to 30 tables. They have 2 separate rooms and I believe a separate private room for big parties. 

Menu was not overly complicated or had too many choices. We decided to start with the fried calamari (a favourite!) And a caprese salad. The fried calamari was a little pricey at 19$ but the portion size was justifable. The caprese salad had a good amount of mozzerella and the vingerette and olive oil complimented the salad very well. A bread basket was also provided and definitely ask for their housemade chilli oil!!!!

For mains we decided to go with the mushroom spinach egg noodle pasta and shared their fish dish if the day (sword fish and artic char). Pasta was cooked perfectly to al dente and was sooo flavourful with the mushroom and the sauce. The fish was seasoned very well and had a very fair portion size considering the price (28$). The fish also came with a side of grilled veggies that were seasoned and grilled very well!

Finally for dessert, we opted to try their Tiramisu... and I have to say one of THE best Tiramisu we ever had before!!! It was so decadent and the cake/lady finger was soaked so well. I am still thinking about that homemade tiramisu to this day! It also came with some pineapples strawberries and blueberries drizzled with chocolate syrup. Yum! Definitely save room for that if you go!!!! 

Overall price is quite fair for what you get and definitely will be back to try other dishes such as their risotto and veal!!"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Calamari was very small portions for $19 not worth it.  
Expensive for what you get, small portions overall."}
{"text":"My friend and I live in the area and have always wanted to try this restaurant so we decided to go for dinner on a Tuesday night. The restaurant wasn't very busy but the waiters however made us feel as though they were and as if they were doing us a favour. 
The food was okay but really not up to par to justify their expensive prices. I had a caprese salad, and the lamb chops with one glass of wine and my bill came to 74 dollars which seems pricey to me for a restaurant on the Queensway. 

I definitely won't be going back after the service we were given. 
If your looking for Italian food In the area I would recommend Grappa or Rocco's Plum tomato."}
{"text":"Superb restaurant had the pleasure of eating there Saturday night had a wonderful fish the owners the chefs came by the table this is a five-star  highly recommend, I  Will be back"}
{"text":"The orange roughy pizzaiolo was perfetto... a savory glaze over a huge portion of delectably buttery-melty fish. One of my favourite places when someone else is paying."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant. Their pasta was really good and suddenly I have a thing for red wine now after having lunch here"}
{"text":"Posticino is an icon in the Italian restaurant industry.  Im sure you often hear the adds on the radio promoting this place.  In my eyes it needs no advertising as its food does all the talking.  I have probably had everything on the menu yet I never get sick of going there to eat.  GREATTT food great service.  All around 5 stars.  Please make sure to make reservation so you don't get disappointed as it gets extremely busy here."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been going here for years and have always left feeling extremely satisfied with the heavenly food and quality service!  

I really have nothing but great things to say about Posticinos! I recommend just about anything on the menu; but if you're visiting for the first time I say start with the Caprese, followed by either the Gnocchi Gorgonzola OR the Veal Marsala with a side of rigatoni vodka, and finish it off with a nice espresso! 


Be sure to check it out the next time you're in the mood for some delicious Italian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Definitely not going back. 
The food is small portions and the wait time for the food and service is horrible!
We ordered Calamari to start $19 - the portion is now half of the size as the picture posted by someone here from February 2016. Using that picture as an example, what looks like to be a pile of calamari, is really a pile of lettuce with small calamari rings and bits of octopus laid on top.
We ordered the calamari and our main course - Scaloppine di vitello Marasala at the same time at 7:30. The calamari took a bit of time to come, but okay it came in an okay amount of time.
Still waiting for our food....still waiting.. oh look the table over there who came after us is already on dessert....still waiting....oh look the head chef is out talking to some people he seems to be friends with over there..., and over there....an hour goes by....still waiting...oh the chef is out again socializing......it's  now 8:45 - and hour and a bit and oh finally our food comes!!!!  REDICULOUS!  
We were so hungry, our small meal was all eaten within 5 minutes and we were still hungry! 
The sauce used was horrible. It had a weird taste to it and was so dark. Not appetizing at all.
We had to wait another 20 minutes to get someone's attention who works there for a possible order of dessert and a drink, but that never happened.
Instead, we just wanted to get the heck out as soon as possible since waiting for the bill took another 10 minutes.
For a $100 meal for 2 people that wasn't filling and took 2 hours to be fully served....very poor service.
We complained to our server - he was a nice guy, but this was a very poor experience. 
He said \"I'm sorry our kitchen is busy\". We told him, \"well no, we seen multiple times the chef out and socializing. Tables of couples who got there after us ate their food, dessert, and left before us.\"
We were just very neglected and it was a very disappointing experience.

If you want a delicious, phenomenal restaurant...I highly recommend Rosa's Place (Weston Rd. and Langstaff)."}
{"text":"Omggg!!! People this is one of the best places that i have eaten in my hole life!!! Calamaris frittis espectacular!!! And then the veal chop its amazing out of this world for realll!! Its a peace of heaven in your mouth!! Thanks to the great service yordan, frank and lauren!!! U just made my night"}
{"text":"Love Italian food! The eggplant parmigiana is amazing here! Definitely going back there for that again. Everything we had was great and the setting was classy, newly renovated and romantic. Service was professional and catering. Nice little spot, would definitely recommend it for a date night. They also have a cute little wine cellar downstairs by the washrooms where you can host a party."}
{"text":"We found this amazing place after trying a few of our usual italian restaurants on Boxing Day but they were all closed, this one happened to be open. What a great surprise! Wine was amazing, food was great (we were 5 ppl and ordered gnocchi, risotto, and 2 kinds of pasta), and good service.

Will definitely recommend it and come back!"}
{"text":"Good for Date Night in Etobicoke

A classic Italian restaurant always involves guests of different ages. Having the laughter and noise is generally intrinsic with an authentic Italian experience. So Posticino is not really that kind of place. To begin with its expensive for family dining. The guests seem very reserved and there are lots of seats where one side of your party would be facing a wall.

Posticino would seem to be to be a good choice for date night in Etobicoke. Parking is easy and the food is good. Service was ok and a 4 top table somewhere in the middle of the restaurant would have helped.

If you don't like a lot of sauce on your pasta, ask them to go easy."}
{"text":"The service here was impeccable I wish I knew the mans name who served us however we were in last night and he meationed he was from Greece. He is a gem don't lose him! Food was good the wine and cheese board could use more variety in cheese and if you added olives to the board that would be amazing because your olives were amazing. Thank you for the complementary bruschetta! The only thing I would have to say is it's quite pricey. But over all good food great service I will be back"}
{"text":"Excellent for this $$ bracket great ambience, Ceasar ok, calamari great both pasta dishes were flavourful and the wine list was larger than the food menu. Terrific service , no music?"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with any of the pastas on the menu. I had the daily special seafood pasta and it was fantastic. Fresh shrimp, clams and scallops...past was cooked just right. Looking for a good Italian in Etobicoke, look no further."}
{"text":"Fantastic on all fronts! Food was a great mix of traditional yet flavours that were really outstanding, fresh and friendly service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food was OK. Too expensive for what it is.  Also $15 for a tiny arugula salad? Nothing especial IMO. 

The thing that was disappointing though was how slow their service was. It was a busy Friday night to be fair, but we saw people who were familiar to them getting served quickly and we had to wait 15 min first to get someone's attention, then wait for 30 min for a salad, and another 30 minute after that for a simple pasta."}
{"text":"I once read you can judge the quality of a restaurant based on the bread they serve. Posticinos bread and olive oil was a so tasty my meal was off good start. I ordered the Tatufuta salad, special fish of the day which was grilled swordfish with a side of pasta and vegetables.

The verdict

The Salad: a giant plate of mixed greens, sliced pears and cheese. Pretty much exactly what the menu says. my friends caprase salad wasn't that much better. 

The swordfish was ok, overlooked slab of canned tuna texture with grill marks served over cold veggies.

The pasta abbriterti was spot on, al dente, with great flavor and authenticity. At the end of the meal I was very satisfied and had dessert. This place is nice for local and offers good good at good value. In the end the bread was the best"}
{"text":"Posticino is my favourite Italian Restaurant in Toronto! Make that North America! I normally stick with whatever special they are working on but my favourite is their Bolognese when they have it and made extra spicy just for me! 

They have expanded over the last few years to make more room for the demand. Very reasonably priced for their great quality. Huge wine selection.

The owners make this place extra special. A great gem on the Queensway.

Enjoy!"}
