{"text":"We popped into this charming little restaurant last night after looking up a good place for dinner in Airdrie....and we were pleasantly surprised!  My girlfriend always has trouble with ordering a muddy Caesar...well our server,  whom made the cocktail, nailed it!  She ordered the Lobster bisque and I decided to go Stampede with Bison canneloni.  Awesome meal with great service!  We had a lovely view of the lake and left with thoughts of coming back! Please check out Peppercorn! We will be heading in for there lunch buffet soon too!"}
{"text":"Our family chose \"Peppercorn's\" for fathers day supper. I ordered the Trout special and my wife ordered Veal parmigiana, both were excellent. Others in our party of 14 ordered Beef Ribs, Seafood (Lobster, Trout, Seafood Linguini, Calamari, Prawns), Rib-eye Steak, Bison pasta's. Service was excellent, our waiter was attentive, food was served hot and in a timely manner. They even offer kids portions.  Service: 5 star (our waiter was excellent) Ambiance: 5 stars (casual to fancy setting, not noisy or too crowded, beautiful location on the water) Cleanliness:  5 stars (appeared new and very clean) Food: 5 star (excellent) Price: 5 star ($22. for the Trout special with rice, prawn's & veggies) ..."}
{"text":"We just finished a amazing dinner at peppercorns. I had the chicken breast, and amazing garden fresh vegetables.  You could taste the freshness. My hubby had seafood linguine that came with home made tomatoe sauce. He complimented the chef many times and how great the food way and that's not like him. Our waiter was so helpful and attentive but not buggy. We will be going back here many times.  You have to try the sauces!!."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here with my girlfriend and her family and  the food was not what we expected at all. I ordered the parmesean veal, it tasted like prepackaged frozen food - we later ordered the cheesecake for dessert which tasted expired. Service was good but the food was definitely not worth it. Way overpriced for the quality they serve."}
{"text":"To start,  The environment was alright. They placed my husband and I near a birthday party of 12 which was very loud so we could barely hear ourselves talk.  We ordered the bruschetta as an appetizer, it was tasteless. There was no seasoning, was pretty disappointing for the price.  The staff seemed friendly enough, mostly concerned with the group. I ordered the sea food pasta plate, again not enough seasoning, but in general it tasted okay. For the price of the meal, I would have expected much more.  Overall, I gave two stars because of the atmosphere being ruined by being seated by a group when other tables further were available.  The staff was friendly but more concerned about the group's tips than ours.  The food was under seasoned, over priced but acceptable.   I wouldn't personally recommend to any one to go there, there are a lot of better restaurants for far less money than there."}
{"text":"A very nice restaurant that features excellent service and knowledgeable wait staff. Appetizers were very tasty. I tried the Linguine Vongole with a special request which was accommodated beautifully. The serving was large and satisfying. The desert of suicide by chocolate was a bit dry and disappointing.  Overall, terrific service and good food."}
{"text":"When told I would be visiting Airdrie for a week on business, my hopes were not high for finding a good place to have a decent wine and a good dinner. But I was happily proven quite wrong! Peppercorns, a jewel of a restaurant tucked on a busy corner and backing onto a peaceful lagoon, was the discovery of the year! When traveling as a single woman and asking for a 'table for one', I often feel a distinct chlll from the server or from the ma√Ætre'd, as if  wondering if it's even worth their time to wait on this poor lonely waif.  This was not the case at Peppercorns. I was welcomed and offered a premier table overlooking the  water.  Once I ordered wine, the mood of the  server improved and the rest of the evening was a delight.  A fine Caesar salad began the courses and it was as fresh as I have ever had.  I couldn't resist the 'Braised Angus Short  ribs in Guinness Stout' and I did not regret my choice!  Succulent, tender, flavorful and accented with silky mashed potatoes and fresh baby vegetables, this was a dish that I will not soon forget!  Amazingly, I was offered a 'complementary' dessert at meal's end.  How good can it be, I thought?  But the maple flavored chocolate cake that arrived provided the perfect meal's end and if I weren't such a lady, would have prompted a good plate-licking.  At the close of the evening, the gracious restaurant owner (who had been on the floor all evening pouring water, changing linens) thanked me for my business. You are most welcome, Kind Lady, and  rest assured, I shall make every effort to return!"}
{"text":"A great resturant with some very nice servers. Brought the wife here for Valentine's day dinner, had a fantastic meal in a very full place that still seemed very intimate."}
{"text":"I enjoyed myself, somehow I didn't realize there's a nice view of the water from inside.   The food was decent! The calamari was cooked perfectly and the carbonara I had was delicious, although a tad watery. Would definitely try this venue again."}
