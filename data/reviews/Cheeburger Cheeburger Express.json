{"text":"Excellent food.  Excellent service.  Excellent milk shakes.  I live on the other side of town so I don't come here as much as I would like too.  Always enjoy my visits."}

{"text":"I ordered Cheeburger through UberEATS and will not do this again. Not only was the food cold when it arrived, but they also misplaced an order of fries and shorted me on the sides of fries I did order. When I contacted them to fix this issue, they said there was nothing they could do and if I would like another order fries, I could reorder them. I will not buy at Cheeburger again, nor will I use UberEATS based on how I was treated. I have pictures for those who want proof. Let me know and I will send them to you,"}
{"text":"I just left from this place, I ordered 10 Oz burger to go. They completely burnt my burger to the point it was hard to bite it.. wow. I waited 35 minutes for one burger and i got a charcoal patty. Not good..."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Use to come here because they had the best create your own shake menu in Vegas.   Now they only have vanilla and chocolate.   (No starwberry ?!?!) And a few different toppings to add in. You also order at the counter now which is fine and I'm assuming it's to make things easier for the employee but come on why change the one thing that made you different from other people(the menu)  My shake was served in a plastic cup instead of the diner feel glass. I loved this place because it felt like a real diner now not so much. I don't know if I'll keep coming here now."}
{"text":"Amassing service can't wait to try the food just checking it the menu is making me want everything"}
{"text":"First time at Cheeburger and they were having a fundraiser for Critical Care Comics, a local group that visits kids at hospital dressed as super heroes, very cool. I tried the pizza burger which was interesting. I would have liked a little more mozzarella on my burger, otherwise it tasted good. The patty had a great flavor to it as well. Also shared a huge basket of fries/onion rings. The fries are seasoned with salted & pepper but of course I also had to get creamy cheese sauce to dip in. The onion rings are thinner with a light batter that isn't all crumbly like most places. Topped off my meal with a s'mores milk shake that was super thick and creamy. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"So... What aren't there more of these in Las Vegas? Anyone? Bueller?  Seriously? How have I never known of this place? Not only is it decorated well... The service? Awesome... The food???! Wow fresh... The Banana Fosters shake? The best I've ever had... Seriously... Why does the south part of town get to have TWO of these and the rest of the valley doesn't get to share the wonder that is Cheeburger Cheeburger?   I'm mad at myself for not finding this place sooner...   Side not.. Each table has trivia cards, so nobody has to stare at their phones... I loved my experience here."}
{"text":"I came in hoping to get as unique an experience as the decor, but I was sorely disappointed. The food was average, but pricey. The service isn't all it's cracked up to be. I don't think it's worth it; save your money, you're better off going to McDonald's."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for quite a while with my grandchildren the servers were very personable and made the experience worthwhile. I was looking forward to the indoor playground opening so that we could go there and then come to the restaurant. We took our grandson for his birthday and we're very disappointed because the servers that we were so used to which gave the place the Atmosphere-that we were looking for were no longer there we will not return, what a loss.  The food is good but the servers made it worthwhile."}
{"text":"Best place ever. Stop what u are doing and GO RIGHT NOW!!! The owner is awesome and the servers are amazing. I can't remember the kids name for the life of me but he has a gentlemens haircut and likes pumpkin smoothies lol. Best burger place in all of Nevada!!!!"}
{"text":"Last night was national cheeseburger day so I took my family of 4 out for burgers and shakes. Man this may be a better location for them because they were slammed. We were luckly enough to be sat right away. We all ordered shakes and appetizers. The onion rings and zesty horseradish is amazing. I had Jenny as my server who is in training and is a total sweet heart my normal server is Curtis (which to the rude remark from another reviewer judgemental much? Tattoos and piercings don't mean your a bad person and no I dont have any.) anyways food was excellent as always for us. There was a small hiccup on a topping I asked for but Sabrina came by and asked if everything was ok I informed her and she had it taken care of right away and we weren't even her guests. We have eaten here many of times and its never just my waitress who checks on me. I have had the pleasure of meeting the owners Dahli and Jahed and even they will refill our drinks and anything else we may need. So pretty much it comes down to if you have a bad time its because your just a negative person or because instead of letting them rectify the situation you sulk in it. Ps dont expect McDonald's fast food it does take time for your food to come......loved the Tshirt raffle last night wish I would have won. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"We popped in for lunch this afternoon, maybe not the best place to choose since the food takes some time to come out and we were all feeling crazy hungry.  My husband & I both ordered our usual, turkey burgers w/ lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles along w/ pepper jack cheese, I added some coleslaw and he added some black olives & chipotle mayo.  We shared a medium basket of onion rings which was plenty for both of us and my son had the cheese burger kids meal that comes w/ fries, applesauce or baby carrots & a kid's drink.  My 3yr old finished his burger, it was pretty small.  We've visited a number of times so I can't say the food is bad but its kinda bland.  The turkey burgers & onion rings need more seasoning but ketchup helps.  Maybe they keep the food bland so you can order some of their signature sauces, which cost a little extra or maybe just to allow you to add on a bunch of their free toppings to flavor up your own burger.  Overall its not too bad, with drinks & tip, we spent ~$35 using a BOGO 1/2 off coupon from the 89178 magazine we received this month.  I also noticed they do offer some $6.99 lunch specials Mon-Fri 11am-5pm on a few menu items."}
{"text":"GARBAGE!!!  - first off, ordered online at 7:21pm. Said it'd be ready at 7:53pm. I arrive at 7:55pm. They don't have my order. Even though I have a confirmation email. The initial lady I talked to seemed too busy to even(even though there was only like 10 people in the whole place)talk to me so she shuffled me off to someone else. Never even got an apology. Then was asked if I'd still like to place my order. Will be another 10-15 minutes.   - wait 15 minutes. Was charged fully. No apology or compensation of any kind. Not even 'would you like a soda while you wait'  - get home. Cold, stale bun. Tasteless meat. Burger torn to shreds in togo foil wrap. Don't have the bacon I paid for. Said I was supposed to get 2 onion rings on it, got one soggy one. Speaking of soggy...disgusting soggy fries. Ordered cheese dip on the side: tastes like you took that cheap gas station nacho dip and watered it down.   I will LITERALLY never be back.   DO NOT EAT HERE!    ....AND I just threw up. Attempted to eat it anyway. Big mistake."}
{"text":"Came to this place for the first time tonight and will definitely be back! Food was fantastic and the service was great. Favorite is the loaded fries!"}
{"text":"Excellent service. The cashier Leanna was super nice and helpful in answering all our questions. She even kept checking on our table to make sure everything was ok. The burgers are pretty good but the side portions are way too small for a combo; almost half what you would get anywhere else. Bread is not the best but the meat tasted fresh and tasty. If you order and finish you get the traditional picture on their wall. Prices are very reasonable especially with the \"build your own burger\" option.  Fries should definitely be a bigger side for the deserved 4th star..."}
{"text":"Any one to order from a diner and takes it home to eat it should expected to be soggy.. Some yelpers here SMH.. This place is nothing but a \"diner feel\" to it. Me and my hubby actually like the new location better. Same great food!!"}
{"text":"My son and I entered the Restaraunt and they handed us a menu .  Before we sat down I told the waitress that we are regulars and we know we want to eat .  The waitress said she couldn't take my order because she was busy and we sat down to wait for an available waitress.  We were then ignored for 20 minutes , we weren't even offered water.  After we sat there starving for 20 minutes and noticed that the waitresses were only taking care of the customers that were already there we got up and we left.   I don't even want to give this place one star because today our treatment was humiliating."}
{"text":"Okay so I thought the bad experiences I've had from this company was isolated to their Eastern Ave location but I was wrong! So I ordered my lunch in advance through Eat 24 I get there and I wait a long time before  i am even greeted, finally the waitress tells me she will be with me in a minute. finally waiting a total of about 15 mins give or take the waitress asks how she can help me. I advise her I have a eat 24 order, she then picks up a piece of paper and say's oh i have not have time to enter it we have been busy. So im confused they can get the printed paper from the fax or copy machine and sit it next to the register but they can't enter my order? So I ask how long is it going to take she says about 10 mins. So i wait about 20 min's finally get my salad, now i am annoyed because I am going to have to scarf down the food back at work before i have to get back to my desk with all the time they have taken. I get no sorry's or anything from the 2 waitresses, then the Chef who has nothing to do with orders being entered apologized to me for the wait and that they were out of Carrots so I'm like at lease someone has good customer service skills and feel better walking out. Then when I get back to work the other shoes drops! I open my Salad and check the bag, I have no salad Dressing!!! Now I am back at work, no Salad dressing so i have to eat a dry salad and the chicken was over cooked. I am so disappointed in this company, I can't say location because it's more than one. I am really thinking about a long letter to their corporate headquarters, When I lived in Missouri i was such a fan because their service and food was amazing"}
{"text":"My burger was ok I expected fries with it at least but nope, my wife got sick from the chili loaded fries. Kids loved there food but we didn't think much of the burgers. Don't think we'll be back"}
{"text":"I live in the area and was craving a burger so I decided to try this place. I ordered a well done burger, fries, and a small cup of ice cream. It was empty so I received my food quickly. No complaints. The manager and employees were really friendly."}
{"text":"They have a great Turkey burger. The staff are very friendly there as well. Cheeburger sauce is awesome!  We order them from Bitesquad all the time. Food is still hot when it arrives."}
{"text":"Super slow service.  Can't image if the place was busy.  The burger was horrible.  Extremely dry.  The shake was good but the experience ruined everything else."}
{"text":"We had heard from our son that Cheeburger Cheeburger was pricey, but had a great burger, so we decided to check it out last Friday evening. As we walked into the blindingly obnoxious pink dining room, we could barely move our feet since they were sticking to the floor all the way to our table in the middle of the restaurant. The one who seated us had the most annoying voice, and we were happy when she finished extensively talking about the menu. We noticed right away that everything was a la cart and the totals that we were adding up in our heads equaled a nice dinner at Red Lobster. When our waiter came, his appearance was disturbing. He had huge gauges in his ears, many piercings, including a nose ring, along with his tattoos. How unappetizing. When he spoke with his hissing slurred speech, we said we needed a few more minutes and decided to leave. Never got to actually taste the food, but ended up having a nice dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"Never actually got to eat. Walked in stood at the counter to be seated. I was asked three times by three seperate people if I had been helped. Each one told me they would be with me in a minute. None of them ever returned. After 15 mins of standing there I left."}
{"text":"You have to try to deep fried mushrooms. They are so good when dipped in ranch. The atmosphere in this place is friendly and fun. And the menus build to custom order. So if you have someone in your life that simply cannot order straight off the menu they would like this dinner"}
{"text":"Nice 50's ambiance and selection of menu. And added bonus of sliders and shrimp. Moonshine glasses is a classic. Now let's talk about the shake selection....yummy!! Half price Monday-Friday 2-5pm."}
{"text":"Placed picked up order for my co workers and myself online, when I showed up to this place to collect the order they were totally unprepared and clearly hadn't even started making the food. When I told the employee that I had a pick up order she just said \"Oh!\" And I watched her pick my online order up off the printer. No apologizes no nothing. Employee just stood at the register for five minutes punching in my order without saying a single word.   I gave this place plenty of time between the time I placed our order online and the time I showed up to the door. Employees obviously don't give a fuck and didn't even apologize.   What's the point of pick up orders if I arrive after giving them 20 min head start and I still wait literally another 30 min for my food?   This place is fuckin' lame."}
{"text":"A real flashback. Big burgers great onion rings and zesty fries. Not fast good but worth the wait."}
{"text":"As the dutchess of two gyms and someone who works out near-daily, you wouldn't think I'd be a fan of this place... but it's perfect for date night because my guy can build his own burger and I can build a fantastic salad!  Burgers are perfectly cooked, and cooked to order, so don't expect it out in three minutes flat. Add on as many toppings as you want, most are free with charges for the obvious like guac and bacon. The 1/3 pound is their most popular, but by guy tends to get their 3/4 pound. Bun always seems to fall apart, not sure if this is because the patty is thick and toppings make it hard to bite or if they should upgrade to sturdier buns.  The Salad-Lovers-Salad is aptly named, and at $10 is a bowl packed with all your favorite ingredients, including several cheese options. You can make it as healthy (cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, pickles) or indulgent (cheeses, croutons, bacon) as you like. Protein is like $2 for grilled chicken, $4 for salmon. Even sticking to free ingredients, the portion is enormous.   They have typical burger-joint apps, sides, and shakes. The fries are skin-on with salt and pepper, and I really like them but my guy prefers their thin-cut onion rings. Definitely try their fried mushrooms, which are sliced (like fried pickles typically are) rather than whole, for maximum crunchy surface area. Pair this with one of their dips, the Sriracha Ranch is my fave. I don't do shakes but my guy swears their malts are top notch.  Service is attentive and friendly, so long as you keep the whole \"this is not fast food\" thing in mind for the timing. Old-school diner Decor features movie photos and props, tables have movie trivia cards for entertainment. Solo diners, grab a stool at the soda counter!"}
{"text":"If you want to waste two hours for an over cooked burger and terrible service this is the place for you! The loaded fries were good, everything else was mediocre at best. I have been wanting to try this place, big mistake."}
{"text":"Ok here we are celebrating my sons 19 birthday. It's a tradition we go to cheeburger, order the 2 lb'er. And make our selves sick. Been doing it for years. But this time we are in the brand new location. Pretty much same staff. Donna mixing shakes. O in kitchen grilling to perfection. Some of the servers are new and learning so I'll cut them some slack. The food was amazing, the burgers cooked as ordered. The fries and onion rings are to die for. I can see the new location will be a big hit for lunch and dinner. Much easier to park. I'm from Florida. We ate the first cheeburger when they opened. So I think I'm a pretty good judge of what the franchise expects. They nailed it. Thank you guys for making my sons birthday amazing."}
{"text":"Disappointing visit, I expected better.   I ordered online thinking it would save time as they advertise all food is cooked to order, wait time is usually 20 - 30 minutes. I ordered a Semi-Serious burger (1/3 lb) cooked medium on a Kaiser Roll, made it a platter adding onion rings and cole slaw, and a root beer for my drink ..the order to be as a 'dine in' customer. It was 7:23pm on a monday evening when I ordered and after being accepted online, I was promised the meal to be ready at 7:50pm. Cool...about 27 minutes, I can be there in 20 minutes...good timing, I thought!   Lotsa road construction on the way, arrived at 7:45pm; walked inside, it's a neat little place all lit up 50s style with rock n roll oldies playing on the muzak.. pretty big menu of burgers, fries, rings, shakes, sundaes and floats.  When walking in, I was greeted by a young woman who said hello and asked if I would be dining in or taking out. I had interrupted her conversation with a young man and a child who I assume were her husband and daughter.  I replied that I had placed an order online and that I was dining in..she looked me up in the computer and I paid for my order. She directed another woman to get my drink for me and offered me a seat and returned to her conversation.   Time went by, 7:50pm came and went .. there was no more conversation with me while I waited. At 8:04pm, the woman who seated me approached me saying they had no cole slaw, 'sorry, can I offer you a dinner salad instead?' No problem, a salad will be fine. Five more minutes passed and she returned with my food in a paper bag, to go. I mentioned that I did not order to go and she turned to the first young woman who was still immersed in her conversation with the young man and child, and asked 'was this a dine in?' ...what, she didn't believe me?   I unpacked the styrofoam boxes while she returned with a knife and fork so that I could eat the salad.  The disappointments continued .. my drink, in a styrofoam cup, (I shoulda got a clue then, eh?) was maybe a 16 oz drink that I paid $2.69 (there is only on size offered).   The dinner salad was nothing special, a couple of hands-ful of lettuce and some croutons with a few pieces of diced tomato.  The onion rings, a single order at 6 oz, consisted of 7 very small rings, battered in a tempura-like batter; the salad and the rings cost $3.99.    The 1/3 lb burger was oval, not pressed flat, so it, and the tomato, sliced onion, etc kept sliding out of the Kaiser roll.  The Kaiser roll was stale and dry and toasting it did not conceal this condition.  The burger, ordered medium, was grayish well done, dry, chewy and bland. I only managed to eat half of the burger before throwing it all in the to go bag and leaving.   No one spoke to me or checked on me after delivering the meal to me..so, being mistaken as a to go order, I guess they felt no need to check on me while I sat there occupying their table.   I don't expect they'll get a second visit from me... tsk, but, they were kids, maybe I expected too much...?"}
{"text":"I used to really love this place. Definitely used to be one of my favorite burger places to come and eat but I just went back a few days ago after not eating their for a while and I was disappointed. Something has changed on their menu, or maybe it's a new chef but the food has def changed. Milkshakes are still great but my food wasn't. :/"}
{"text":"the diner has a throwback theme and its nice for what it is but I found the quality of the food a little 'meh'. Chee Burger is like Five guys in the way that you can customize your burger with pretty much anything but the quality of the beef and the lack of seasonings made my burger almost inedible. Also my milkshake was pretty watery. The best thing on the menu seems to be the chili and it tasted canned. The only reason I am giving three stars is because of the mason jars filled with soda (those looked neat), my boyfriend is pretty obsessed with the place, and the fact that they give a free burger on your birthday. If my boyfriend didn't like the place so much I'd probably never return again."}
{"text":"Love their burgers and love their service! Very attentive and very friendly! I like that you can choose so many toppings! Been going here since thy were at their old location next to Pho Annie. Will continue frequenting this place and everyone I've recommended this place to lives it as well! Yummy shakes and love the atmosphere! Very cute diner!"}
{"text":"Cheeburger is a nice hole in the wall, it has an old diner vibe to it with a neon pink glow.   The food is what you would expect from a diner, good just somewhat bland. What's fun about this restaurant is how creative you can be with your toppings with little to no charge. Honestly, if you want a burger with options this is the place for you.  Eating gluten free is also an option. They have GF buns but sadly no dedicated frier.   Overall this is a fun place to get a burger and shake. Nice vibe with fun food. 4/5."}
{"text":"Worse experience ever! bad vibes rude worker, i wish i would of got her name but this happened May 14th 2017  around 4:15 pm. We walk in to the restaurant and no one even help us there was this older short lady in the front counter and we were just ignore after standing there for at least 4 minute she actually said hello and asked us oh i didn't know u were there, her attitude just straight sucked ass and she was rude almost gave me that feeling like she was racists tours us because of how she was treating us. it was going to be my first time there and we didn't even end up eating, we left because thanks to this stupid  lady ruined our  experience to try this restaurant for the first time."}
{"text":"Wow, did this place take a dive.  I guess its fine if you've never been here before and are looking for a decent burger, but for those of us who were customers back at the old location this place has tanked.  No more sweet potato fries?  Strike one. No more lunch baskets?  Strike two. Music so loud we could barely talk?  Strike three. Half the fries we used to be served?  Strike four. Cheap plastic cups? Strike five. Waiting in line to order instead of ordering at the table?  Strike six. Undertrained staff?  Strike seven.  The staff is nice enough, but this place used to be staffed with professionals not teenagers.    I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is closed for business has a sign saying thanks for the 9 years of great business thank you to all the cheeburger fans."}
{"text":"Alright you guys buckle your seatbelts because I'm about to give you all the information you need to know about this place. So I'm at work thinking \"hmmm I'm American I don't wanna drive and get food for later when I'm working...let me UberEATS.\" So I'm scrolling through to see places that can deliver me food and this place was an option. Never heard of it in my life; and neither have my coworkers. The pictures looked good so I was like \"alright let's see what's poppin\". So I place an order for a double cheeseburger with bacon, some fries, and an Oreo cheesecake shake. So I'm ready man I'm here at work about to get me some bomb a** burger and a shake like a true fat American. Homegirl from UberEATS comes with my food and I'm like \"gurrrrl\" and she's like \"gurrrrrl are you tracey?\" And I was like \"yeaaa gurrrrrl\".   So i open my food and see that i got like 13 1/2 French fries...I got the regular fries, but they were seasoned with some weird a** kind of seasoning like they had a kick of spice to them (not to be a stereotypical white person who thinks like orange juice and sh*t is spicy). But they were pretty good. They're portioned like a mcdonalds kids meal frie, by to be honest, I didn't really mind I was more in the mood for a burger. So I open the burger and it's pretty decent sized. They're small, but the patties are a little bit thick so it has a taller size as opposed to like a wider burger that most places have. The burger meat was a little suspicious to me...and the bacon honestly tasted like cheap great value pork. It was disgusting. I had to take it off and I'm a HUGE bacon fan. But let's get to the point of this review man and how this place ruined my life. About an hour and a half later, my a** is a fartbox. My bootyhole was releasing literally enough fart powder to pollute the air of a small country. So I look at the time and I'm off work in 2 hours. I look into a mirror and pep talk myself to not be weak. I can wait till I get home to go potty...ten minutes later my guts twisting and making me feel sick. I need to sh*t. So I call up the front and tell the people I work with that I need to be relieved to go potty. So about 10 minutes later I get relieved and bisssshhhh lemme tell u call me sonic the hedgehog running to that bathroom fam. So I get to the bathroom and my booty become shy and doesn't wanna go. Mannn I might as well just end my life there. I just got sick belly cramps from this place man and they not even gonna let me release and be free...my belly still hurting and I haven't left work yet, I'm off in 20 more mins...pray for my poor booty and poor stomach man and I'll pray for yours if you decide to eat here.  Ps,  They fu**ed up on my shake and just gave me Oreo instead of Oreo cheesecake smh"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Cheeburger Cheeburger since I've seen a few around town. Anybody who knows me knows I loveeeeee burgers and fries!!!   I really like the vibe here....50's diner feel. Plus they got vanilla coke!!! Any place that got your diner style vanilla coke...I have to order one! =) Got a regular hamburger with the usual condiments on it. You get to choose from a looooong list of what you want on your burger. They got practically everything you can think of: mushrooms, onion rings, diced garlic...etc. Unlimited choices of your fixins and sauces. Only thing you have to pay extra is if you want more than one kind of cheese. Also, my friend and I ordered a medium basket of regular fries....big enough for two adult females to share.   In my opinion, the food was pretty good. Although I asked for my burger to be cooked well-done but there was still a little pink in the middle. This would have been a 4 star rating. I can't stand seeing my meat even with a slightest tint of pink...thank goodness it didn't mess with my stomach. Despite that, this is definitely a repeat restaurant. It's a pretty good burger joint...so why the heck not?"}
{"text":"was good / nothing out of the ordinary but a cute place / I should've tried one of their shakes so this review is probably not fair but we had burgers and friends and they were A OK"}
{"text":"This place was great.  Our fam night every fri.  The dimise of this place waa going express.  Sad to see it  has closed."}
{"text":"This place has gone seriously down hill. What a disappointment!! The new menu and policy of this establishment is less than satisfactory. Don't expect much customer service, they won't even let you PAY for substitutions. I just got about 10 fries with my meal. I am very sad to say I see these doors being closed for good before too long."}
{"text":"This place had a cool nostalgic diner look to it and the staff was extremely friendly and welcomed my daughter and me. My rating is based solely on the food. I had a build your own burger with  cheddar and pepper jack cheese bacon sauteed onions chipotle mayo lettuce tomato pickle Salt & Pepper and the burger was still bland, there was nothing about it that made me excited. The atmosphere was nice and I could see how this would be a cool place to come to with friends, but it is not my first choice."}
{"text":"One of the worse dining experiences I have ever had. The burger was too small for the bun. The bum was burned on the inside and raw on the outside. I asked for A1, but whatever sauce they used was not A1. The fries came heavily peppered which meant my two toddlers could not eat them. It was so bad I could not eat my burger and ended up eating my kid's grilled cheese. Please don't waste your money. Stay away."}
{"text":"I'm kind of sad, but not surprised, to see this place has closed. For years, this was our family destination for all celebrations, birthdays, and the place to take family coming in from out of town. This was THE spot. We loved it. Then they suddenly moved to the smaller location. At first, it was still okay. But then they went to express--requiring we order at the counter. The options and quality went down too. It wasn't the same anymore and we stopped going.  My daughter is getting ready to graduate high school. I asked her where she wanted to go eat and she said she wished we could go to Cheeburger Cheeburger--the way it used to be. All the kids started talking about how they missed our celebration dinners at Cheeburger. It's sad they had to run it into the ground."}
{"text":"Call your order in beforehand!!!!!!!!! I've been waiting about 40 minutes for one burger and a shake to be made. What a mistake not calling the order in. Don't get screwed like I did. They take forever. Great food n shakes but they need to pick up the quickness"}
{"text":"Good food good service it's a fun family restaurant with that 50s diner feel to it!!!"}
{"text":"This place has changed a lot. Don't have a lot of the foods we use to order and the shake options went from 1000 to like 10. Apparently they're now a express location, Why did they change???? If you want an OK burger this is the place but honestly just go to in-n-out. The manager (I believe) is super sweet and nice though. I give her 5 STARS... place was clean and service was good but sorry to say, we won't be back."}
{"text":"Really good food, the best shakes and super friendly staff! Perfect for casual lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"Amazing shakes but the person taking our order (Donna) just called someone a \"retard\". Not a word that should be used, let alone in front of customers."}
{"text":"While I said I would wait until this place got better in reviews I came back. It wasn't better but also wasn't worst. My burger was cooked perfect but completely unseasoned. But the onion rings OMG were so good! Actually had horrible service"}
{"text":"Just found this place and love it! With a name like Cheeseburger Cheeseburger how could you go wrong. Retro 50's diner vibe. Very clean, very friendly, good value, and very tasty food. Unfortunately It is not real close to where I live or it would be a regular stop. That being said I will be making the effort to visit on a somewhat regular basis. They get it right!"}
{"text":"This is the burger join I have been looking for all my life! The food here is authentic and it tastes terrific. Way better than In-N-Out and I love in and out. I love the 19 fifties Diner theme. This is definitely my new spot ."}
{"text":"This place, for the lack of words, totally sucks now. I loved coming here for the shakes, but everything is cut in half now. The employees seem like they hate being there, so in return we received crap service. We walked in wanting a shake, we couldn't see the menu too well so the lady at the front pointed down which was nice and showed us where the shakes were listed. We looked for a bit, and decided we wanted the chocolate banana shake. She looks at us with such a straight face and says \"we don't have bananas.\" We replied laughing saying \"why didn't you tell when we were looking at the shakes.\" All she said was \"what,\" so disappointed with the menu and the clueless employee we left. This wasn't the first time we dealt with clueless people. We walked in another time, not aware of their closing hours and walked in to order a shake. Mind you, their neon open sign was on and the doors were unlocked, so we assumed it was open. The employee then tells us \"you can't order we are closed,\" so we questioned the neon open sign, and again just a blank expression. Sadly, both times we were never able to get a shake, and now we will never get a shake from that place again. I remember the servers being so nice, but since the express crap happened that all went down the drain."}
{"text":"The location is much smaller than their previous restaurant, but the theme & quality of the food is still the same.   It's a cute \"Diner\" themed restaurant.   I came in for take-out, but the food took a bit longer to come out than I expected"}
{"text":"The burgers were cooked well and very delicious but the fries were really crunchy. We ordered a birthday cake shake which was ok just had a bunch of sprinkles no cake pieces."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant twice in the last month.  I've had the 1/3 pound burger both times and my partner had the grilled chicken on the 2nd visit.  We've also both had shakes, fries, and pickle chips.  All of the food was perfectly cooked and tasty.  Although the items are made to order, we didn't feel that we waited an abnormally long time by any means.  While the food is really good, the service equally shines here.  We've had outstanding service on both visits.  All of the employees and the managers are friendly and serious about delivering a fantastic customer service experience.  The theme is '50s diner' and is done tastefully; not a ton of junk on the walls.  This place was also very clean and easy to locate and get to from Rainbow.  The milkshakes are wonderful, with over 500 flavor combination possibilities.  There is a milkshake 1/2 off happy hour Monday - Friday from 2pm-5pm for dine in only.    I look forward to more visits!"}
{"text":"Under cooked food and even worse service.   We ordered some food to go, the burgers were ordered medium and medium well. It doesn't matter what you order them they were rare and raw. We called them within minutes saying something and the manager was quite rude, when we got there the owner was rude as well, so I see where it comes from. We will not be back and this is disappointing as they are pretty much right around the corner from my house.   On a good note and the reason for a one star the mushrooms were good."}
{"text":"Very few people in the restaurant, yet they all were served before my party (which consisted of four starving kids) even though we were seated well before the other parties.  The kids' milkshakes came out long after the food.  The French fries were covered in pepper.  My son's requested medium burger was raw inside. Won't be back.."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a very long time and we finally did.  It's wasn't what I expected, which was just a regular burger place.  It's actually a 50's style diner!  I love that!   A variety of burgers with endless and free toppings and the hundreds of shake combinations will never bore you.   I've never seen so many before.  I definitely plan on going back for just shakes only.  The burger I ordered was good, and cooked exactly as I requested.  And I love love love their beer battered onion rings.  Good food and good service overall."}
{"text":"Best diner burgers ever. Love the onion rings and all the dipping sauces. Kaiser buns for the burgers are so good. Amazing !!"}
{"text":"So yucky... ordered on Uber eats before I checked yelp. Fail! I'm a believer of Yelp reviews- probably not even 6 minutes after I ordered I called to cancel the order. Supposedly the food was already ready and the driver was there to pick it up. What the what?! Why didn't I just go to the McDonald's drive thru if I wanted a pre made burger. After spending 30 dollars and unable to get any kind of support or refund from both the restaurant or Uber eats, my husband was willing to still try it. SO DISGUSTING, so soggy and definitely premade!!! I will never ever ever ever ever come back here or recommend it to even my worst enemy. BARF. frieS are gross too. Super soggy, not fresh. YOU HAD ONE JOB!!!!"}
{"text":"We had been waiting to come in to the new location so we thought what better day to come than National Cheeseburger Day! The only positive of our visit was being seated right away : (  We had a couple questions regarding the menu and our server Ashleigh seemed to be confused herself and was really no help. Food came and was good but the service just ruined everyone's mood that no one cared to stay and have shakes. Please improve on training servers and maybe we'll come back."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at a Cheeburger Cheeburger.  I got the Serious Burger (medium well) on a honey wheat bun.  It was cooked perfectly..no issues with it being undercooked.  My boyfriend got the veggie burger and told me that it was really good and it was crispy on the outside (which he liked).  We shared the loaded fries; they come with chili, cheese sauce, jalapeños and onions.  It wasn't anything above what you would expect from a diner chain for the price, but it was good!  The service was great! Alex was our server and she visited our table frequently to check on us and make sure we had everything we needed.  She was very polite and friendly - definitely added to the experience :)  We went for lunch and the restaurant remained only about half full.  It was pretty quiet.  The location is great..there is ample parking available and there are other shoppes around if you feel like doing any shopping while you're there!"}
{"text":"The burgers were excellent. Got the loaded fries but to me it was a little too loaded. :)) the only thing I don't like is the wait. But overall it was good!"}
{"text":"I have been to the old location of CheeBurger Cheeburger several times, in fact it was the first place I took my family when I moved to Vegas. This was a return trip to the new location. CheeBurger Cheeburger is back in the groove!  The service was great! My burger (1/2 pounder) was seasoned well and cooked right to my taste. The onion rings were lightly battered and full of flavor. The shakes were packed with toppings and served at just the right consistency. The only thing I didn't like was the fact my stomach isn't bigger, the servings were large.   I'm already looking forward to my next trip here!"}
{"text":"The shakes are great, but the food is mediocre. The burgers are pretty flavorless. I've been here any times, but this was the first time at the new location. It felt like they have trouble keeping up with a lunch crowd. We got our food quick, but it took a good 15min once we were done eating to get out check, and we never got a drink refill.   I don't really like coming here, but my daughter loves the chicken fingers and shakes enough that once a year I can deal with it."}
{"text":"Great clean place, 50's diner feel inside. The staff is nice and patient when u r ordering. You can make it own burger, fun. Just remember if u r in a hurry do not come here BC they are not fast, fast food.  The food is good will be back to try another burger."}
{"text":"I love this place! They will make anything you want, from their menu! It's all reasonably priced too. It has that great 50's diner feel."}
{"text":"This place was very very good. Haven't felt I have had my money's worth in a burger joint in a long time. I feel the fries for 2-3 were not enough for that many people and I finished them my self. Could have been we went 10 minutes before closing and could have affected our order with what was available. As for everyone complaining about time it takes for food etc. be happy your food is being cooked fresh. People LOVE to complain about things as if what they do in their job is perfect. This place I highly recommend . The food is fantastic! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"New location is great...best shakes this side of the Mississippi...but buns not good, hard dry...soft potato buns would be sooo good.  Tasty meat. Fries are great...onion rings are tempura style..light"}
{"text":"Ok I just confirmed it myself that all the reviews with 3 stars and below given are pretty much accurate.   We got here and ordered 3 kid burgers and 2 American classic with the works.  The food arrived and all the burgers were medium with a little pink except for one that was raw.  I sent it back and they refired it. I also asked why wasn't I told these burgers were cooked a little pink because if I had known I would have asked to have them cooked well done.  One of the employee said it is mentioned on the menu, which it wasn't listed anywhere on the menu.  just not a fan."}
{"text":"My gf & I ordered a classic burger & kids classic or whatever.  We waited for 22 minutes & then the worker said their printer is broken so no ones order was sent thru to the cooks in the back.  The cooks in the back can see through their window that there are 5 tables of people waiting.  A guy came in with a phone order & they said they haven't started his order so he asked for a refund.  The workers announced the printer malfunction situation & another 2 groups asked for a refund.  They offered us a free shake or dessert so we chose the birthday cake shake. It was creamy, good texture, tasted great.  5 minutes later, we finally got our food.  - The bun was way too big for burger patty. The burger tasted mediocre at best. Shake Shack, In n Out, & Five Guys burger makes this place a joke  - Fries were good.. tasted similar to Five Guys fries  - Serving amount was somewhat small.. definitely overpriced for how much food you get   \"World's greatest burger\"..... not even close haha"}
{"text":"Very very good apps, all hand battered. Fried pickles were very good, fried mushrooms also. Milkshake was very good also. Birthday cake milkshake. Fair style onion rings."}
{"text":"Walked in, (cool retro vibe) seated really fast then asked about ordering the lunch special ($6.99) that's on their website and was told they don't have the \"advertised\" lunch special? Right after telling us that, she said they have \"another\" lunch special that when added up equals the exact price as ordering a la carte? Back to the reason to visit, the burger was cooked VERY uneven: medium well on one end/ almost raw on the other. I believe I counted 12 fries in my meal ($9.99), it just tasted ok/nothing special. The best part was the milkshake that was pretty tasty, chocolate/banana ($5.95) After seeing the bill which is on par with a Restaurant featuring a \"RED\" bird, but doesn't compare to the quality of food from there, I'm probably not going back to this location anytime soon."}
{"text":"The turkey burger is pretty good. The side salad was wilted but quickly replaced with a fresh new salad. The server Carrie is a very sweet, attentive and efficient server. Not to mention she's easy on the eyes but a very hard worker and a good reason I would come back to dine. She gets 5 stars the other staff members were all kind and smiling even the manager as well. Best of luck in the new location."}
{"text":"This may seem a little biased, but I LOVED the place for what they were, and dislike the place for what they have turned into.   Now that they've officially changed the name, I know I \"should\" be rating this place based on what they are, not what they were (without any personal bias) but it's kind of hard to when they really just added to the same name while cutting the menu in half.   Their prices are what a restaurant should be priced at... but they USED to be a restaurant. As they are establishing, their not a restaurant anymore. They want to be looked at as fast food now (express). Here is the problem with that... They have $6 milkshakes... McDonald's is fast food and has $3 milkshakes about a block away. My gourmet burger I ordered here costed $10... in what fast food world?   I loved this place for the servers. Really. They made this place. But now their employees are forced behind a counter the entire time. So they are like really nice, friendly, personable caged animals. It's sad. I wish they let them be servers again. That ONE SINGLE THING would make this difference for me to make the cost worth it. But right now, it's not."}
{"text":"I'm revising my old review from a 5-Star to a 3-Star location. Here is why:  There menu cut down arguably more than half it's former selection. I love(d) their sweet potato fries. I love(d) shake options they have chopped, gutted, and removed half of. And the biggest thing I remember noting about this place that I love(d) was their wait staff. They had the friendliest, most proactive staff I've encountered in a long time. Now they have cashiers. Like, literally... that's it. Granted they are pleasant and polite, I loved engaging in conversation with the servers there, and it's not like the cashier's are dull, but they are stationed where they are supposed to be, doing their job.   This went from a restaurant to a fast food restaurant with no drive thru. This went from a place where the menu was infinity and beyond to finite... very finite. This went from a place that was like a second home with a second family that I'd frequent arguably weekly to strictly business.  Music is still oldies like the diner feel is and I do love that, food (while basic now) is still good. But the reality is there are other places I could be paying $8 for a burger that have the atmosphere I miss so much about this place.   That's all..."}
{"text":"Eek, wish my review wasn't going to mirror the other bad ones, but unfortunately it will. Just finished dining here. Quality and service has greatly gone down hill since the location moved to Warm Springs and Rainbow.  We waited for 45 minutes for two orders of fries and one order of Buffalo Wings. Our wait was nothing though compared to three different parties waiting on to-go orders. One poor Uber Eats driver waited FOREVER. I'm hoping he still got tipped.  Manager ran around the place spouting off one excuse after another to each waiting table. Finally, when it came time for our check, it was again a waiting game. I ended up just going and standing at the register to  see if we could check out there.   An employee took our cash ($20 bill for an $11 tab) and actually had the nerve to ask if we wanted our change back. Ummmm...yes! I'm sorry. You're NOT getting a $9 tip on an $11 tab with atrocious service.  Our poor waitress actually did a good job at keeping up on our table as much as she could within her power.  When it was all said and done, the last excuse of our dining experience that we were given was something along the lines of, our waitress had to go back and cook, and that's why we didn't have our check? WHY wasn't the manager back there cooking? Or at LEAST take over her tables for her so they're not just sitting there. Poor girl can't do everything, and obviously the kitchen needs some major help.  Anyhow, I don't see this location lasting long. Our experience was only one among many that we witnessed AND read on here, unfortunately after the fact."}
{"text":"Not what I expected. I assumed this was a drive thru fast food restaurant chain but it is actually a full service sit down restaurant chain. I would put them in the same group as a Johnny Rockets. They have the 50's style decor and friendly wait staff that Johnny Rockets has but that is where the similarities end. The Cheeburger Cheeburger burger absolutely destroys Mr. Rocket. I ordered the \"Classic\" on a Kaiser with American, chopped garlic, onion and pickle. You can select multiple free toppings ala Five Guys. Perfectly cooked medium, hand formed fresh beef that was wonderfully seasoned. This is a first rate burger. Accompanying my burger was an order of \"B.O.B\" aka best of both worlds which is half onion rings half fries. The fries were fresh hand cut and wonderfully potato-ey and the rings were nicely fired and seasoned. Overall, was dang impressed with my visit and I am shocked by all of the negative reviews."}
{"text":"I just walked out of this place. Service and people were fine.   Ordered a burger fries and drink. I knew something was wrong when the burger came right out. 2 bites and it was raw inside. In fact, it was not even hot, but barely warm inside.   The fries were so greasy I had to wipe my hands after each of the two I ate.   First and last time here.    PS. I'm writing this review while I'm at Farmer Boys down the street enjoying a burger and fries."}
{"text":"In-n-what?  Forget that noise! THIS is the REAL cheeseburger in paradise! Or South Rainbow I should say!  I love theme restaurants, or at least restaurants that are designed to resemble an era of the past, and Cheeburger Cheeburger does the ultimate throwback to the burger joints of the 50s!  I absolutely love their burgers.  Nothing but the best!  Absolutely made to perfection from the kitchen to your mouth!  With toppings galore and wide varieties of side dishes to choose from plus different sauces!  It's the ultimate burger bacchanalia!   Their shakes are equally out of this world and I am hoping to try more in the future!  Only wish there was one in Summerlin!  But for now, I'd venture out there to get a taste of these burgers ANYTIME!"}
{"text":"This was our second time at Cheeburger Cheeburger, our first at the new location. We won't be back.   While the service was good, the food was not. Both my husband's and my burgers were bland and flavorless, even with the addition of \"seasoning\" and toppings. If you base your restaurant on cheeseburgers , they had better be good, and these just weren't. The bacon was terrible... Hard as a rock - completely dessicated and tasted RANCID. I had to take it off my burger. I should have just sent the whole thing back. I mean, for the love of God, how do you screw up bacon!?!   Fries were unremarkable and soggy. The best thing we had was a bite of my sons chicken fingers. They tasted like regular chicken fingers, but compared to the three other burger meals they were pretty good.  My stomach is queasy an hour later... Hoping I am not going to get food poisoning from that nasty bacon. Ugh.  Just go somewhere else. No amount of toppings will ever make these burgers any good."}
{"text":"This has to be the BEST place to get burgers, I come here a lot and they never let me down. Not a big fan of onions but these are really fresh and good.   Go try the 1 pound challenge and get your picture on the wall"}
{"text":"Well, I liked the burger and the place. I guess the wait time is a lil high but good overall. Onion rings were awesome."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Cheeburger Cheeburger. I have always loved  places that let you customize your hamburger with a wide variety of ingredients. I ordered a half pound burger on a kaiser bun. I loaded on the ingredients! I made it a platter with onion rings and slaw.   When I got my order the burger looked amazing, the onion rings did not. The burger was juicy and packed full of flavor. I would say one of the best burgers I have had in a long time. The onion rings however were sad. They were bland, limp and just overall not worth my money. On top of that I received 4 rings. How does that count as a side? My friend ordered fries and their platter had an over flow of them.   The Cole slaw I got with my platter was average at best. Very little flavor. Should have gone with a salad instead.  Overall if you plan on going here to eat, stick with just a hamburger. Seems like everything else is less then par here. Wish I could get my money back for the platter upgrade!"}
{"text":"I have been to Cheeburger at least a dozen times, and now that they have changed it to be \"express\" I can confidently say I will never be back. I got maybe 12 fries with my burger, and for one burger combo (fries/drink) and an order of fried mushrooms to come out to be $20 is absolutely insane. You have to refill your own drinks, nobody checks on you... fend for yourself. My meal was tasty but it's hard to praise the food for the cost.   I don't see this business model being sustainable for very long, it's a complete change for the worse."}
{"text":"Wow is all i can say and not in a good way either!! We used to come here all the time before our conflict of schedule, now u order ur food at the counter, pay for it and u can leave a rip all before getting ur food?! Umm NO TKS!!  What happened to old fashion waiting tables for tips?? I requested a bunless- burger, it came out on Shredded lettuce & the size of a hockey puck.. Dry as all hell! Idk what happened to the Old crew, but this is the last time we'll b back.. you have a better chance getting decent food at McDonald or Burger King and that hard for me to say VERY Disappointed!! Save ur $$..."}
{"text":"Decor: Cutesy diner style  Service: Super friendly employees  Milkshakes: Amazing! I tried the creamsicle and loved it.  Burgers: I technically ordered a patty melt (which was alright) but holy moly... These things are HUGE!  Fries: Nothing really special. I got the chili cheese fries as pictured on the menu; I wasn't a fan of the chili."}
{"text":"Tonight a friend and I took our kids (7 total) here for a fundraiser for our school. Needless to say with that many little ones, we made quite a mess. Everone that was there working, were amazing in dealing with our kids and their mess. Plus the food was amazing! Good food and good atmosphere. We will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Damn....gave up In N Out for this...should have gone with gut instinct.  Ok the good the service was spot on I came in about 3:00 pm and one couple seated when I came in.  The bad...what I came here for...the cheeseburger...bland!!!  Dry and tough weird not what I expected I rode in from Red Rock casino and passed up my favorite spot for this.... the fries another mess they seem hard stale...sorry I wanted to like this place because I heard it was great ...unfortunately no Damn just got the bill almost $20.00 for this ouch Including $3.00 tip...smh"}
{"text":"All of the options to add to your meal are great. I had the veggie burger in a wheat wrap with sautéed mushrooms and onions, tomato and sriracha.  Yum! The fries weren't crisp and a little soggy but it the wrap and my boyfriends \"serious\" burger were good."}
{"text":"The customer service was swamped. They looked short staffed today. Poor folks. The food was actually good considering they were busy. I was hoping for a better experience since it was my first time here and heard good things. I want to return on a different day. I believe in second chances and off days."}
{"text":"I've been to the location on eastern before and I felt like the service and food was better at the eastern location. I believe the buns were different from the eastern location because I don't remember all of our hamburgers spitting out the pattys when I bit into them. The waitress told me she had to be out by 830 and she wanted to know if I could cash out before she leaves (prob just received my food about 10 mins before her asking). She dropped the check and it wasn't correct. 3rd times the charm, finally got the check. She told me that the shakes would be ready when I was ready to leave. She checked out and I didn't see her after. I always give 20% even if I'm put in that situation. (I'm a waiter myself. But I never ask my guests to cash out when I have to clock out, I'll just transfer the check to another server so I don't rush the guest.) Anyways.. Waited for the shakes, they were great but again I had to ask for my shakes from someone else because my server left and she was supposed to prepare them. So I had to wait another 10-15 mins after I was done and paid for my shakes to go."}
{"text":"I agree. I just went there yesterday. And what sucked the most above all those strikes is my son ordered the pounder, ate it and they didn't even have a camera to take a picture. And when you look at the pictures they have, they are in blk & wht. This place simply has no color anymore!"}
{"text":"The food was decent it was just a bit much to listen to Donna throughout my entire lunch hour complain about her management team and how they don't have a clue about running a restaurant.  How they have bad benefits, how much other people make at their jobs which is not nearly what she is making, yada, yada, yada, blah, blah, blah.  By the end of my lunch, I wanted to go home and stick my head in a gas oven.  Please people, keep the disgruntled employees in the back of the shop."}
{"text":"Good burgers, but don't expect quick service as everything is made to order.  Had the 1/3 pound burger and it was quite good.  All the toppings you could ever want are just about included in the price.  The shake menu is a little over the top as you could make over a 1,000,000 combinations. With all the options, it does take some time to figure out what you want.  Pricing is fair and the service is good, but with all the options, the food and shakes do take some time."}
{"text":"We got the Loaded fries which came with chili, cheese, jalepenos, onions and ranch. The large was enough for our whole fam to share as an appetizer, and they where tasty! I love how their burger menu is set up as 'invent your own' you can customize it how ever you want. Great family restaurant!!"}
{"text":"There should be a 0 star option. Thursday night-3 groups in the entire restaurant & 2 were in the end stages of their meal. We get seated right away and order the \"best of basket\" and 2 malts. Waiter disappears. Never comes back. 30 minutes later we are one of two groups left in the restaurant. No waters, no food, no malts. We finally asked the \"manager\" what was going on and he tells us the waiter forgot to put in our order. Totally inadequate service."}
{"text":"The shakes are great, the service is terrible.  Walked in, the 2 women ( one looked like she just rolled out of bed ) behind the counter were too busy to help.  One was on an ipad, the other took our order, but immediately said the other woman will ring it up and walked off.  Instead of putting down the ipad she fiddled with it for another few minutes (long enough where I wanted to walk out, but wanted the shake so I bit my tongue).  After she rang it up, they finally started making the shake at their leisurely pace.  I thought maybe it was me, but another client walked in and they didn't even acknowledge her the entire time I was there.  Fire these 2 immediately and hire someone who cares.  You will go out of business with people like that repelling your clientele."}
{"text":"What can I say....this was one of my favorite places to talk about but now they fliped it like a Burger.  I brought a client in to try this place after a massage @  840pm and they refused service and said they had no drawer. We managed to get our order in just to be served shi##ty food along with @$$hole service.  I have never been so embarrassed for myself and the crew that Mr Jahard has hired.  I've tried to reach the Mr J,  yet no one knows his schedual or he's at another store blah blah blah I will be stopping payment on this establishment and will tell all my clients to try another place with better service.  Rude service, bad training gets no where in my pocket book."}
{"text":"Food was great as always. wasn't sure if I would like the counter service now how service was faster due to this.  Service was great!  4 stars as they removed items from their menus.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Had to check out the place that omits the \"s\" from cheeburger. It has more of the fifties diner look inside. Decent menu but a little over priced for what it is. The service was friendly and food came out normal time. I had the macaroni bites as an appetizer then a cheeburger pick your size they offer four sizes and I got a side of a mix of fries and onion rings. Food was tasty bit tab was a little high in the end. I could have gone to a better sit down restaurant for the same money."}
{"text":"We greatly enjoyed our visit at this quaint 50's retro diner. Service was fast and pleasant. The options to customize your meal are virtually limitless. Over 20 free toppings/sauces/seasonings to add to your burger, along with choosing your patty size. Even more options available to customize your shake/malt.   We ordered chili cheese fries and out only disappointment with them was we forgot to ask for onions on them. They were delicious!! We also ordered sweet potato fries with a marshmallow cream dipping sauce... To die for!!! Our burgers were very generous with fresh ingredients. The only thing different I would do next time is order my patty medium well. Medium was too pink for my liking.   Additionally, our shakes were by far the best part of our meal! Add as many flavors as you like with a lot of options to choose from. I ordered a seasonally appropriate pumpkin and cheesecake shake. The regular was almost too much!   All in all, we had a delicious meal and wonderful service. We will be retuning and definitely recommend."}
