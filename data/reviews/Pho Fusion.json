{"text":"The food was excellent, well presented, served hot and extremely tasty. The restaurant is clean and the staff is very friendly and most accommodating. Highly recommended. Came here based on ratings and was not in the least bit disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is bomb, starting to become a regular spot for us.   Good selection, but at the end of the day the pho is best choice.   Highly recommend this place especially cold winter days !"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best bowls of pho I've had in Aurora/Newmarket area.  There was a short line when I went.  Super busy, but food was great!  Definitely my go-to Vietnamese restaurant."}
{"text":"Best pho in Newmarket. Hands down. I have tried them all. The service is friendly and  lightning fast.  All the dishes are delicious."}
{"text":"I was in Newmarket and wanted Vietnamese food. The place was clean and decor was nice. Service by the two ladies were good . I had pho and companion had vermicelli. The taste was good. The portion was on the small side. The price is about 15-20% higher than most Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto. Compared to other Vietnamese restaurants in Newmarket this is one of the better ones. I did not see the \"fusion\" in their menu or flavoring."}
{"text":"Food was delicious; has limited vegetarian options. We got there around 4:30 and it was empty; but within half an hour, it was packed with people.  Mango shake is also really good."}
{"text":"This place has good fresh food overall, but it could use some improvement on specifics.  On the down side, the shrimp on sugar cane was bizarrely salty, and dubiously non-shrimp tasting.  The spring roll didn't seem to have any glass noodles in it at all and the avocado shake was sweet and made me wonder if they were using powder rather than avocadoes.  The hot coffee with condensed milk was oversweet (it is always stunningly sweet but this was too much) and a bit gritty.  I didn't finish either the coffee or the shake. Also, the fish sauce tasted like someone had added a little vinegar to it.  On the other hand.  The trimmings on my bun included mint and peanuts.  The lettuce was fresh, the vermicelli was perfect, the grilled pork was scrummy.  The spring rolls TASTED great and were perfectly cooked.   The service was great and friendly and the restaurant was pretty busy for after lunch on a Monday.  So, I may give it another try sometime."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food and a clean environment.  A little slow because it's very busy, but definitely worth going."}
{"text":"This is my favourite lunch place. I usually have the rare beef and meatballs Pho and always have the California Roll style fresh roll. Since I normally order the same thing, I don't even have to specify what I want, I just tell her, \"the usual\" and she knows exactly what I mean. The staff is friendly and attentive. A few weeks ago I forgot my debit card there. I called and the lady that owns the place assured me that she had put it away for me. I went later on that day to pick it up and she returned it to me with a smile."}
{"text":"Absolute best pho restaurant I've been too. My personal favourite is the Mi Tom bo sate , it has a kick of spice if you enjoy it you must try."}
{"text":"Came in to order take out today for lunch, cause my fave Viet place was closed.  First thing you should know is that I am Vietnamese and I cook extensively - so, yes, I know what I'm talking about. Also, I do not write reviews because I have 3 kids under the age of 5 and do not have the time or inclination, but I was real angry today. Don't screw with my food.  I ordered: XL pho dac biet (with all the weird Viet meats), bun noodles with grilled beef and two orders of the veggie spring rolls.  Pho:  - the broth was flavourful balanced and had depth -  they did not separate the raw meat from everything else so my noodles were bloody (thanks for that.) - the cooked meats were cold so when everything was combined I had to reheat the damn thing which in turn over cooked the rare beef and made the broth murky - there is a shit ton of msg in the broth and I died of thirst afterwards - not enough bean sprouts and basil especially for an extra large order   Bun noodles with grilled beef: - the grilled beef was literally the size of my 4 month old daughters hand, and pounded and thinned out to within an inch of its life - oh they dressed it up real nice with lots of peanuts and pretty pickled red onion but I know a con when I see one. What little I had of it was pretty good though. - some of the noodles were dry and stuck together - sprouts and other veg was crisp and fresh and pickled onion was a nice surprise  Fried veg spring rolls - burnt in some areas - tasted meh - boring plum sauce for dipping  I also waited 20 mins for my dry old noodles and for them to ladle prepared pho broth into a container.  In conclusion, I suggest you never do takeout and always dine in, the better to shake your fist at them when you are not satisfied with your dish."}
{"text":"Service is fast and friendly. Had a rare seafood option for pho, which is great. Herbs and bean sprout were fresh, and broth was surprisingly flavourful. Would be back!"}
{"text":"It's taken me a long time to get around to writing this review, but after my latest meal there, I figured Pho Fusion deserves to be seen on Yelp!  This restaurant, like almost everything else in Newmarket, is located in a strip mall...there's a surprise!  Upon walking through the front door, the decor is very nice and very clean...a great start as far as the whole strip mall dining experiences go.  Pho Fusion is run by a husband and wife.  The wife (Gail, I believe) runs the front of the house, and the husband (Tom, iirc) is the chef.  Anyhow, I had never been to a Vietnamese restaurant, but all of my friends were telling me that I had to try pho, so I figured that the new place would get my business...I'm daring that way.  I've eaten there about 20 times now, and I will say that they use the absolute freshest ingredients you could ask for.  Everything I've tried (although I keep going back to rare beef pho) has excellent flavours and is very, very tasty.  The portions are generous...great value for the money.   The rolls are all fantastic.  I stay away from the deep fried and opt for the fresh.    The Pho is really excellent.  I always opt for the P01 (rare beef with rice noodle soup).  The pho is available in three sizes S ($5.50), M ($6.50), L ($7.50).  The large is a massive portion...but I'm not shy, and I always leave thinking \"Why can't you just order a small, fatty?\".  But that's my own personal problem.  Not being familiar with Vietnamese cuisine, they always answer my questions and offer helpful suggestions without ever once making fun of me or squirting hot sauce into my round eyes...for that, I'm very appreciative.  The service is always with a smile and I've always left Pho Fusion feeling that my business is appreciated...that is a nice change as well.  If you in Newmarket/Aurora and want to try out a great place with great prices, I'd highly recommend Pho Fusion."}
{"text":"We had some fun in Funnery park & cafe. And just checked out that this is the closest Vietnamese restaurant. And my comment on this is: great food and service.   The ladies who served us are very kind with smiles. And the rice noodles are so hot and yummy. My daughter and I shared one L bowl. And it us just a perfect size.   If we go to Newmarket again, this will be my first choice for lunch definitely.   Note: you have pay the bill in their cashier counter."}
{"text":"One of the places that I have gone back countless  times, great place if you just want a quick meal, nothing too fancy. Excellent customer service, foods are always prepared the way you request them to. Prices are reasonable for the portion of the foods. Recommend."}
{"text":"It took 30 mins for two spring rolls and two phos and two bubble teas. The food was not bad but service was too slow, and the bubble tea tasted too light."}
{"text":"Came for dinner wit hubby. We were excited to try a pho place in Newmarket.  Pho: broth a bit on the sweet side. Portions are good for a small and massive for an XL order. Beef is fresh. However, quite thirsty 30mins post meal.   Sweet and sour soup with shrimp: not really good in terms of how the ingredients are put together overall as the soup. Bunch of bean sprouts in a hot sweet and sour broth and fresh cooked shrimps(not bad). But seems like the everything had its own taste in the soup and cannot really taste unified as a soup.   Fresh rolls with shrimp: rolls were good but not too satisfied with the dipping sauce, seems blend and watered down in terms of its flavour.   Service: nothing to complain about until the end where we paid with Amex at the cashier and transaction was already approved and went thru, then the owner refunded it on her own and came to us and said she did not have Amex registered for service in the machine.  Insisted she already refunded it back into our credit card already, gave us the refund receipt and ask for us to pay again with another card. Not very friendly attitude from her when it is her request to ask someone to do her a favour to pay with another card that they have paid already and authorized in transaction done in another method / type of card. Because if the card went through then obviously it should mean the card should be accepted as a means of payment and available with this machine. Standing there debating with the customer when it's not the customers problem actually looks quite unprofessional on her side. Anyhow, that part took all the other points earned from the food/meal (4 stars)."}
{"text":"Sooooo good. Boyfriend and I shared a rice noodle soup with rare beef and the roll-your-own cold rolls with BBQ beef, sausage, shrimp, julienned carrots and cucumber, bean sprouts and pickled onions. Oh, and a spring roll. Everything was spot on delicious, highly recommend this place! :)"}
{"text":"Pho soup is deelish!!! So are the fresh rolls.  Their rice is so yummy too!  My go to for Pho!!!"}
{"text":"We came on a very busy weekend afternoon - the two servers were swamped doing everything from seating, busing tables, and filling take out orders. However, the food was tasty. I enjoyed the do it yourself rice wraps - lemongrass chicken, yum!"}
{"text":"The best pho in the gta. I'm lucky it's around the corner from home!!  We have been regulars of this place for years. Come early for lunch it fills up fast but the service is quick and you won't wait long.   There isn't one bad thing on the menu. It's all good but the pho is best."}
{"text":"Not just great pho, but rest of the menu is done well also. I like the won ton soup, and shrimp rolls in rice paper. Friendly service to match will be back."}
{"text":"I generally eat here once a week. The food is fresh, fast and delicious. I have had the pho, pad thai, grilled chicken with vermicelli, cold rolls, satay soup, and chicken fried rice and they were all fantastic! They are often quite busy at lunch time so go a bit on the early side if possible to avoid a wait."}
{"text":"Horrible service. They took the orders of people who came in after me.  Then they served people who ordered after me.  I felt like they ignored me because I was on my own. I waited for over 30 minuted then they said the kitchen messed up.  If you are going to keep your customers happy , hire more staff that know what they are doing."}
{"text":"We come here often for a quick fix of pho when in Newmarket. This place is is usually packed by 12pm on a weekday so get here quick.   I usually opt for a bbq pork vermicelli with o I like about it is they include mint and pickled onions/beets with the dish. Very refreshing.   The spring rolls are not my favourite but it's still good.  I've also tried their sate mi noodle soup and its good as well (it's made with a chicken broth, a little spicy and is served with egg noodles - which seemed more like wonton noodles)."}
{"text":"Nice lunch spot with friendly service. We tried cold shrimp rolls, fried spring roll and pho. Cold spring roll were very good as was the pho. Pho was very fragrant with a nice taste.   I will be back."}
{"text":"The pork summer rolls (called rice rolls on the menu) were the highlight of our lunch. The beef pho was good but a touch on the salty side. Friendly service and good value for money. I'm glad I found this place."}
{"text":"This Vietnamese restaurant serves one of the best egg noodle, rice noodles and vermicelli soups.. Try the sliced beef and shrimp noodle soup.. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great pho. It is Newmarket after all. Try the avocado shake as well. It is delicious without being overly sweet."}
{"text":"I agree with a fellow reviewer. This is one of the best Vietnamese pho restaurants in the area. I might even say it's worth the drive from Toronto (that's where I am from).   I've had the pho and bun here and both are great. They use fresh ingredients, and the flavours (for the pho) are close to perfect without being overpowering.  The noodles are cooked perfectly - not overdone and mushy like many other places I've been to.  I thoroughly recommend this restaurant. I need to convince them to open up a location in Toronto."}
{"text":"\"Pho-nomenal\" delicious pho is served here. I've been coming to this spot for a few years and it never dissapoints my soup craving. I usually get the \"house special\" pho which has rare beef, tendon, tripe and tiny beef balls.  Their broth is homemade with a rich beef flavour that is smooth and light.  A large bowl cost $8.75 and is satisfying. This is one of the better pho places in New Market/Aurora area. They are always pleasant in service towards customers. I've tried some rice dishes before and wasn't dissapointed but I mainly come here for pho. It's your basic pho kind of place most people  are accustomed to; where you help yourself to chopsticks and soup spoons. Typical Asian resto table layout. Condiments such as chili sauce, hoisen are there ready to squirt on your meal.  Place is small can hold maybe 50-60 people.  If you have never tried pho or Vietnamese food I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have to agree with Scott W., Pho Fusion is perfect. The food is very tasty and the service was very friendly. Very reasonable for two people to eat."}
{"text":"Love this place, we come here regularly. House special pho or BÚN vermicelli is what we usually get, love those dishes! The fresh spring rolls are also good. It's clean, service is not super fast but reasonable.   Add: one of the times when visited, ordered bubble tea with tapioca. It had a very strong burnt taste (what!?) ... tapioca was burnt but still used in the drink. It was bitter, even with all the sugar trying to mask the burnt flavour."}
{"text":"Yeah, this works for me!  I have been in for lunch and dinner, mostly when I want a bowl of Pho.  For the dishes that come in regular and large sizes, I can't imagine anyone being able to finish a large.  I couldn't finish the regular!  The soup is great tasting, with an iceberg sized serving of rice noodles just below the surface, and a healthy serving of protein on top.  I alway test using the Seafood Pho as a reference point.  Every morsel of seafood in the dish was perfectly cooked.  Judging a Vietnamese restaurant has been difficult because pho is usually executed well regardless of the rest of the menu.  However, Pho Fusion is a notch above the others.  I am now a regular!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Fresh and made to order. Staff are very friendly, and I am always craving their pho!  I go a couple times a month now! Always busy, so they know what they are doing and people like it! Prices aren't bad, you can have lunch for about 11$ and it's a lot of food.  Their spring rolls are excellent, super crispy and light.   One of my fave restaurants in Newmarket!"}
{"text":"This is one the authentic Vietnamese restaurants found in the neighbourhood. The favour of the food is tasty and the foods they make are traditional vietnamese cuisine. The portions and price are fairly reasonable.  The only two disappointing thing is that they don't  have fresh noodles which is one of the staples of vietnamese pho. Also, the drinks are overpriced.  Inside the atmosphere has vietnamese decor which is nice.   Will probably go there again. It is a convenient location for quick craving."}
{"text":"Tasty soup, good hours (10). Not sure what else to say, I would return; always a good sign!  Polite family run restaurant."}
{"text":"Yes, you can find decent Pho even in the boonies! This is usually my go-to place after a nice day on the slopes at Blue(if I make it back in time!). Nothing beats a nice bowl of hot and delicious soup after battling the snow and elements all day.  The Pho has a very good broth; hot, clear, delicious and not too overwhelming with the MSG. The beef is surprisingly rare even in this hot bath of soup. Other items like their springs rolls, fresh rolls and vermicelli are all pretty good as well. You are not going to find mind blowing, gravity defying stuff here but this place can definitely run with the big boys in town.  Looking forward to another season on the hills and Pho Fusion....Only if we get snow this year :("}
{"text":"I read about Pho Fusion a couple of days ago here on Yelp and decided to check it out with my girlfriend last night for a late dinner, and now I find myself back here for lunch the very next day.   Tucked into a strip mall on the southwest corner of Mulock and Bayview, from the outside Pho Fusion may not look like the most appealing place to stop for a meal. But like most things you can't judge a restaurant  by it's facade. Inside lies a simple but elegant decor and uncrowded seating for about 50.   The staff was polite and helpful offering advice on selections and the food service has been quick during both of our visits with the plates hitting the table within 5 minutes of our ordering.   Being perhaps the most unadventurous eater in the world both meals I tried the Pho Tai (Rare beef with Rice noodles) and been very pleased. The beef was delivered in piping hot clear broth allowing you to cook it to your own personal tastes and the noodles and bean sprouts were both fresh and crisp.   I highly recomend Pho Fusion to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"This was my first time in to Pho Fusion and I have to say that I'm impressed. Very clean and modern inside which is surprising for a strip mall restaurant.  I drive past this place all the time and never gave it a second look, until now.   I ordered H02, chicken and shrimp noodle soup.  Delicious and fresh.  Can't wait to come back here for more.  Update - I've been back here a few times since my first visit and I love this place.  The food is amazing.  Pad Thai is my favorite in town, as it the hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"Pleasant servers, good food. I tried their beef pho, dried noodles with dumpling, pork bbq, chicken with rice, all good. And they open til late too."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for pho in Aurora/Newmarket area!  I would say the pho here is better than the ones in Markham/Richmond Hill area for sure.  Soup base is clear yet full of rich flavor. We tried a couple other places in the area I think we like this one is the best!"}
{"text":"We happened to be up in Newmarket and I thought I'd search my trusty Yelp app to see what people suggested for lunch. We came here and were super happy we did! The recommendations were great - we ordered the cold shrimp rice rolls to start and we each had a small bowl of pho (I had the shrimp, boyfriend had the rare beef). The broths were fantastically tasty (trust me, I've eaten at probably 30 Vietnamese places in and around Toronto and this pretty much tops all of them), super fresh basil leaves, bean sprouts and lime to add to our pho. Service was excellent, quick, thorough and friendly. Prices were good. I wish that they had a location downtown so I could go there more often!"}
{"text":"Authentic enough to please my mother in law from Vietnam! Great place to have in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch while in Stouffville, Pho Fusion knocked my socks off with excellent pho sate.  I really just wanted a decent bowl of pho and they delivered that and some.  The broth was nice and clear but had lots of depth.  Noodles were cooked just right and the meat (brisket, rare beef and tripe) all tasted very good.  Only downside was that they didn't have culantro which would have made for a perfect bowl of pho for me.    I'm not often in this area but boy, if I am, I'll come back to Pho Fusion in a hearbeat for more of their excellent pho.  Thanks, Pho Fusion!"}
{"text":"Big menu.!!  Soups are excellent, vermicelli is \"where were you hiding from me all these years?\" - I fell in love.  Pho Fusion tops my soup and noodle restuarnt list. No long waits, very amicable staffs, and quite inexpensive."}
{"text":"We had the raw beef Pho noodles. Their large is the equivalent of what a medium would be. Broth could be more flavourful, as it tasted a little watered down. Vietnamese Shrimp spring rolls were decent considering the price.  The Viet coffee my friend has was too small, sour and lukewarm. Have had better elsewhere. Overall, decent place to satisfy pho cravings."}
{"text":"Best Pho I have had in a while! I had the shrimp rice rolls and the spicy seafood vermicelli soup.  The soup is absolutely delicious and the portions are reasonable for the price. The ingredients are fresh and simple, yet extremely flavourful. If you can really handle spicy food, you will find that their spicy soups are not really spicy and might want to add a little chili oil/ hot sauce.   The shrimp rice roll was fresh and delicious as well. There was good size  shrimps in there, which is always a plus. Peanut sauce is great too.   Service was quick and friendly, we were for seated right away."}
{"text":"Pho Fusion sets the standard for Pho for me.  The food is always fast, tasty, and very fairly priced.  I've been going to Pho Fusion for a very long time.  The owners treat everyone very much like family.  It is also a favourite of many of my business associates.  I must keep a gluten free diet, and I am able to have the Pho with no issues.  If you need to keep a gluten free diet, avoid the soy sauce, and the Hoisin sauce.  I always order the house special.  It comes with tendon, tripe, flank, rare beef, and beef balls.  They know how to cook tendon perfectly.  It is my favourite part of the soup.  I typically also skip the tripe.    I am able to have this soup as a high protein option as well by skipping the noodles and gettign extra bean sprouts.  The Pho is the best, the service top notch, the pricing is very fair, and the portions are large!  Plus they are great people to talk to as well."}
{"text":"Newmarket, Pho?!  Wow amazing.  Hubby and I stopped by here for a late night pho/soup binge - what with pregnancy cravings leading me all over the universe in search of soup.  The food was very good and flavours spot on.  Service was fast.    The place was packed - obviously there are many fans."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for Pho Fusion!  I was weary about trying pho again. I really didn't enjoy it the first time but a girlfriend of mine (with good taste buds) kept telling me how delicious is really is. She'd tell me all about the poison sauce, the add-ins, the raw beef... After a few weeks of this I decided I'd try it again. Well, first off, it's actually called Hoisin sauce. Apparently my listening ears weren't on. Second of all, it was actually really tasty.  I thought Pho Fusion was wonderful. The service was prompt, the presentation was appealing, the flavour was apparent and my company was spot on. I ordered a small shrimp pho & shrimp rolls with a peanut sauce. The small pho is enough for 1.5 people, honestly! I stuffed myself to the brim with soup and took the rest to go for lunch the next day. It is definitely better the first time around but I'm not complaining. The peanut sauce for the rolls was also really, really good. Be mindful the rolls are served cold but they too are filling.  For a lunch that really could've been my lunch + dinner, I paid $17 which included tax and tip. Jasmine tea is on the house. I noticed a lot of families dining in too which to me shows it's affordable. I also felt my order was pleasantly healthy.  Might you be asking if I'd return? For sure I would!"}
{"text":"I go to Pho Fusion fairly often.  The menu is very diverse.  Often I have a big bowl of one of the many delicious soups that they have. Tonight I had the lemongrass beef roll-your-own cold rolls.  There are lots of ingredients so you can customize them to your own personal taste.  There are carrots, bean sprouts, pickled onions, beef (I chose to have it not spicy, but you can choose the level of spice you want), cucumbers, lettuce, mint, rice noodles and two kinds of sauces. There are plenty of rice papers, so you could share this dish with someone.  It also came with a spring roll, cut in three pieces.  The restaurant itself is casual with families often dining there.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  It is a very comfortable place to dine.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favourite pho restaurant in Newmarket! The Pho is delicious! The small is a very good size. I also ordered the fried rice and I was blown away! Everything came out hot and fresh. Servers were really kind! I felt welcomed and can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"I heard pretty good reviews from my coworkers about this place so I decided to give it a try. It was busy when I got there so we had to wait a bit before we got seated. I ordered a small pho with beef, tripe and beef balls. The food came out really slow, and when it arrived I didn't get my beef balls. I told the waiter and he brought me a bowl of beef balls.LOL.  It was REALLY SMALL for a SMALL so I don't think it's worth the price.   The broth was a bit too sweet to my liking but was flavourful and not oily. The beef was good quality and not fat. I feel like the pho was a bit Canadianized, so it's not as authentic as I thought it would be. Food was around 3.5 stars.  The service there was super slow. We went there for lunch so we were a bit tight on time. I asked for a spoon, it didn't come until 10 mins later... I don't blame the waiter though, he was the only one working and the dining room was jam packed.  This pho restaurant is nothing special. Just an average Viet restaurant. I wouldn't go back as there are better ones in the GTA."}
{"text":"Decided to go North for lunch for a change.  Restaurant environment was nice, clean, quiet.   I had a large which was decently sized and tasty but priced a little higher that other Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"Today we were craving Vietnamese food, so we decided to try somewhere random and new. Found this place on yelp so we thought we would give it a try. I walked in and no body greeted us asking how many people we had. I literally was standing there for about 5 minutes until I could get the attention of the guy working there since he was looking my way but didn't say a word.... strange.    I ordered pho chay (vegetarian pho) in a medium, Hubs for the XL pho Dac biet to share w the kids. Plus a side order of the shrimp fresh rolls and fried spring rolls. Also another order of the grilled pork & chicken on rice plate.   I was surprised to see only 2 small spring rolls w/ very little fish sauce (no garnishing of lettuce & pickled radish and carrot) on the side. Fresh rolls were large mainly filled w noodles, dipping sauce lacked flavour.... disappointed. The flavour of the regular pho was more beefy rather than perfumed with the aromas of cardamom, cinnamon and fennel seeds. Tasted more like beef broth w noodles. The plate of grilled meat was ok, usually you would expect a hunky chunk of meat when you order these types of dishes but the meat was very thin and small portion. The vegetable pho was ok, lacked the \"pho aroma\" that most people associate a bowl A pho to but overall I enjoyed the mixed vegetables in the bowl of noodles.   Would I go back? No, probably not. Maybe just for the pho chay. If you are looking for an authentic Vietnamese place to eat- maybe try elsewhere. It really stands up to its name \"..... fusion\" maybe it was catered more towards non-Vietnamese people so the flavours are not as deep and rich like the true authentic way of making pho etc."}
{"text":"I never tried the Pho or Vietnamese food before, I tried the rare beef soup, and I like it.  The large bowl is indeed large, I couldn't finish it, and btw, the prices are pretty reasonable.  It is a bowl of very hot beef stock, with rice noodles and some rarely cooked beef slices on top.  As soon as you dip the beef in the soup it fully cooks which I found interesting!  It comes with some veggies ( sprouts, sage, onions I think) on the side that you would through in to blanch.  The stock tastes great, and the meet has no spices on it, which I'm guessing that's how it is done in Vietnam.  The menus has a nice variety, and on the Saturday I came in, the place had a good crowd.   The service is friendly and warm, and everyone gets free jasmine tee with their orders.   I will definitely visit again to try other items."}
{"text":"My Go to spot In Newmarket. The people are really friendly and the food is always on point. I have zero complaints and only amazing things to say. I love this spot and can't go to any other Pho spots compared to this one in Newmarket.   I usually get a rice dish, and a small Pho or even a rice dish and a large Pho depending the season, always leave this place satisfied and full and ready to sleep right after, without feeling like trash.   Love this place going to go next weekend"}
{"text":"Go here all the time. Quality of food is always good, food comes out very quickly, staff is courteous."}
{"text":"If your ever in Canada and in the mood for some authentic Pho or Chinese cuisine, this is the place to stop at. Guaranteed to go home full and happy. One plate along can't justify, taste so good you will be wanting more. I recommend the beef pho and spring rolls......."}
{"text":"A Cold Freezing Day  A Hot Bowl of Pho  I came to Pho Fusion at Newmarket with not much expectation.   Rare Beef, Tripe and Meatball Small Size ($6.95) was quite a good portion. Rare beef still rare and the hot soup was hot enough to cook it to medium rare right at my table.   Service was OK. They were a little busy inside the kitchen so I had to find someone so I can pay. Some of the chopsticks in the bucket on the table were a little dirty, with food particle sticking on them.  Not a bad choice if you feel like some Vietnamese when in you are in the area."}
{"text":"Really awesome place for pho in Aurora!! I always get the extra large bowl of pho to share with friends and family. Pad Thai is also very tasty. Prices are super affordable considering the large portions and fresh ingredients. The servers are nice but they tend to be quite busy as the restaurant is popular, so you gotta have some patience if they can't come to you right away."}
{"text":"I have a new found love for rice noodles with chicken and rare beef. Staff are friendly, prices are reasonable and the portions are fantastic."}
{"text":"Really great Pho in Newmarket area.  One of my favourite places in Newmarket Aurora area. Pho is authentic, tasty and love the sweet aromatic broth.  We ordered two rare beef pho's, one small and one extra large.  Extra large is really really big so next time would have done a medium or large but great value.  We started with their vegetarian fresh rice spring roll and it was very delicious and great peanut sauce.  Staff are Uber friendly and place is always busy as have some great Vietnamese dishes. Urge all fellow Newmarket Aurora peeps to check this out.  It's in a strip plaza, always clean and fresh food that's delicious."}
{"text":"Spring rolls frozen! Over priced for below average food! Poor services and server didn't understand our requests! Also server did not want to bring us plates to eat off and expect us to eat out of a tiny bowl! Unaccommodating and unfriendly! They also overcharged for shrimp in dish by $7 add on!"}
