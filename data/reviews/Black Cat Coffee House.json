{"text":"Local, friendly, tasty and community minded! This place is very low key and welcoming with a great selection of caffeinated beverages. The staff and the owners are also very cool with supporting their local community charities and go above and beyond to help out however they can. Has been a neighborhood favorite for myself, my coworkers, and friends in the Arcadia area. We especially like the punch cards!"}
{"text":"Great selection of coffee and friendly customer service. Free WiFi and comfy chairs make this place a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My big sister loves their chai tea.  They also allow the local high school musicians to play an open mic concert once a month.  This is a nice place to meet up with friends."}
{"text":"The drinks here are great, it's just that the atmosphere is weird. A lot of people studying and on their computers. I felt weird for talking to my friend as it was so quiet in there. But that was later at night, during the day it's very busy and can get cramped while waiting for your drink."}
{"text":"Great place to get work done while enjoying some fantastic coffee. I'm also a fan of the B-cat bomb. Protein, peanut butter, banana and espresso is a great way to power through your day."}
{"text":"I've tried a bunch of different coffee shops in the Phoenix area, and the lattes here are the best that I've found. I love it!"}
{"text":"This place has everything needed to be a hit.  The espresso is delicious, the sandwiches are homemade, yummy and reasonably priced, the staff is friendly and the environment comfortable.  It's also open until 10 which is nice for those of us who find ourselves tied to desks until 5 or 6.  And bonus - I was visited by one of the owners who sincerely asked if everything was as good as it could be.  Nice touch.  Their web site and social media presence seems to need some help but as they've only been open for 5 months it's understandable.  I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I was in the area and came here on a Sunday afternoon to get some studying donee. Black Cat is nice and cozy inside. There was plenty of seating available, and it wasn't too loud like many coffee shops, so I was able to be fairly productive. Also, the WiFi was fast and reliable, so I didn't have to wait an eternity to get things done.   The service was great. The barista was very friendly and gave plenty of recommendations for good iced tea flavors. I ended up going with the Pomegranate green tea, which had a nice sweetness to it, but was balanced well by the tartness from the pomegranate flavor. Especially on a hot Phoenix day, it was a very refreshing iced tea!  If you're in the area, I definitely recommend coming here to get some work done, relax for a bit, grab an iced tea or coffee, etc."}
{"text":"First time coming to this or any coffee house and I did not regret it. I went in for tea and I didn't know what kind I wanted. They walked me through the the kinds and flavors. I chose what kind I wanted and it was very very good. The were very kind and had smiles on the whole time. I liked the atmosphere as well. Music wasn't too loud or aggressive. Very mellow. A good place to read a book. Definitely coming back and recommending this place to anyone who asks for a good place for tea or coffee."}
{"text":"Black cat coffee is super cozy and warm feeling. You are always greeted and the folks who work here make it feel like a heartfelt experience. It's generally filled with low conversation; however you will notice that sometimes a young child with a family will come in. Generally, they are well-behaved and their parents are actively paying attention to them."}
{"text":"Good espresso and biscotti.  Nice neighborhood hang."}
{"text":"I seriously LOVE finding amazing mom n pop spots! Hot fresh brewed tea that tastes amazing on a breezy evening at a cute tea shop with great music softly playing in the background is soooo good in my soul.  The man friend also loved the breakfast sandwich! I could be here for hours! Definitely coming back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!  I always go for the Blended Coffee which is iced and has just enough malted flavoring!  Very nice baristas!  Local art for sale on the walls. Very reasonably priced, as well! I guarantee you will love it!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Not for selective coffee drinkers. Only one dark roast on tap, was served lukewarm. Ran out after one cup and another batch was brewed for my friend. Second batch wasn't properly brewed and tasted like, well, nothing. Brown hot water. They graciously replaced the coffee with a tea, but won't be back unless stopping by for a pastry."}
{"text":"Used to be good coffee shop with a good customer service, but since it bought out , the new owner keeps firing good experienced people and hires people that have no clue what they're doing. I had to wait 15 minutes to get a cup of coffee. He needs to stop offering molded pastries and expired food to his customers. It waste of time and money to go to this coffee shop."}
{"text":"This was my favorite coffee place for the last couple years.  Unfortunately it was bought out a couple months ago and the new owner is a joke.  He keeps jacking up the prices.  He got rid of the punch cards for a new system, and now he won't accept a $10 gift card I have with no expiration date.  I hate people who write bad reviews on places, but I felt the need on this one.  This guy is ruining my favorite coffee place"}
{"text":"I originally came into this coffee shop for a vanilla latte because I heard their espresso tastes really good.  I was greeted by this handsome young man that was really charming. He was very outgoing and I actually felt like he was interested in the conversation we shared. A drink called the Black Cat Bomb  with very inviting and vibrant lettering was advertised on a chalk board next to the register, and was explained as the pride and joy of the coffee house. He made me the drink and topped it off with a dome lid for extra which was a nice touch. The Bomb tasted great, but does seems like a once in a while drink. I will for sure be back for my daily coffee needs! Great experience!"}
{"text":"Great vibe. Great coffee. The place is dark and cool, out of the heat; you can really enjoy a hot or cold cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Here on a visit and decided to give Black Cat a try based on other yelp reviews. I thought it was very good! Nice decor and staff was very friendly. Didn't have to wait but I can image this place can get busy. I like the garage style open frontage and they have nice chairs to relax in while you drink your coffee and have a chat. I'm here for a couple more days so I'll be back....."}
{"text":"There are several reasons why I can never camp out at other standard coffee shops (e.g., Starbucks): I don't enjoy the food, or the coffee, or the crowd.  But then I came to Black Cat.  And now I don't want to leave.  I know what you're thinking: \"If it's not crowded, it's not delicious, and if it's crowded, it must be great.\"  No.  It just means that most people are sheep [who enjoy burnt coffee].  I have been sitting here for the past two hours, and there has never been a moment at which every single table filled up.  That means I could have walked in at any moment and found a table.  I wasn't hungry yet, so I started out with an iced apricot (white) tea.  No sweetener, and it is superb.  I read some of the other reviews before I came, so I knew to order a large.  Smart move.  I got hungry a few minutes ago and ordered the Black Cat Melt (Smoked ham, provolone, Dijon mustard, red onion, grilled on marbled rye) with a side of fruit.  I apologize for not having taken a picture, but I was hooked at the first bite.  This is a thick-sliced rye, toasted to a warm-but-not-burnt perfection (how did they know I like my toast this way?!); the Dijon mustard is a delectable mustard, and there is just the right amount of ham and cheese--not so much that I feel gluttonous, but not so little that I feel deprived.  And there is a banana on my plate.  And it doesn't have any bruises.  I'm in heaven.  While I was waiting for my sandwich, I took my headphones off long enough to hear some of the employees talking to a very talkative little boy.  He was having a ball.  Anyone who can engage a small child and simultaneously make a sandwich this perfect has my vote.  I plan to be here for the rest of the afternoon.  And I'll definitely be back again...and again...and again."}
{"text":"Very cozy and friendly people and service. I will be coming back to spend my money here. It's about the people not the corporations."}
{"text":"This place has the best toddy! I had gone to Starbucks earlier today and got the toddy with coconut milk and it was still bitter. I knew Black cat had smooth toddy and I was craving it for the rest of the day. I got a medium black toddy and it definitely didn't disappoint! So smooth you don't even need cream."}
{"text":"Pretty terrible. Coffee was both burnt and weak, and more expensive than Starbucks. Service was poor as well, but nothing stands out, just seemed like they were bored with their lives. At least they keep the cream in the fridge."}
{"text":"Best Chai Tea Latte around in my eyes.  A little sweeter then the norm but really hits the spot."}
{"text":"I think I have a new favorite coffee shop.    Black Cat serves one of the best lattes I've ever had.  The peaberry french press was perfectly roasted and perfectly timed.  Great cookies, awesome biscotti.  Modern, relaxing, comfortable decor.  Super friendly service.  Love it!"}
{"text":"My dog hates it when I'm on my laptop, so I love coming here with him when I need to work.  He gets to people-watch and there's a bowl of water outside for him.  Reasons I keep coming back: Thai iced tea, yummy mochas, tasty and freshly made breakfast sandwiches, easy parking, indoor and outdoor seating, punch cards that give you free drinks, and friendly employees."}
{"text":"I'd learned of this area before and was seeing a shop in the exact same strip mall. I understood I had to attempt it, I love black cats! I purchased a Thai Iced Tea and it was yummy. The cashier asked me if I needed a punch card (amazing, since most places I Have been to do not request and I find out later) and she gave me 2 stamps because it was my first visit. Too trendy. It is not a suitable place for me but if I was in the place I Had stop by and try their java. Super fine staff and there was lots of customers there loving themselves."}
{"text":"Love it. My wife is addicted. For me, the Vanilla Chai is amazing."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I used to live down the road and completely gave up starbucks for them!  the staff is very friendly and knows my name and usual :-)  This place is way underpriced!  the large (32oz) is 4.50 m (24oz) is 4.00  inc tax!  How awesome is that?!?  They have thai tea, lattes,protein shakes, fruit shakes, italian soda, if it's a non alcoholic beverage they have it!  The food servings are huge!  You order a bear claw and it's the size of your face!  and the breakfast sandwich is fresh made (they go make it) and ginormous (i eat half and am full!)     This place is tops!  Great food, friendly staff and awesome prices!    I recently moved from down the street to scottsdale (near buzzberry) and while i like buzzberry the prices can't compete (buzzberry 24 oz (large) is almost 7$ after tax! )  their yogurt cup is half the size but the same price.  Buzzberry is good and they serve lunch and dinner and are 24hrs with a drive thru but they are much more expensive!  I still drive to black cat whenever time permits!  :-)"}
{"text":"The drinks are really good here, but the food not so much.. I came here with a bunch of my girlfriends and we all got drinks and a pastry. The drinks were super good and yummy, but the pastries(croissant, cheese danish, muffin, etc.) were not good at all. They were dry and it tasted like they were sitting out for days. I was very disappointed with the food here. I recommend the blended drinks. But once again, do not order the food."}
{"text":"So I finally made it into BC Coffee.ice coffee did not wow me average at best.nothing much to eat.. Sorry three stars is as high as we go"}
{"text":"I started going to Black Cat when I moved back to the Valley in April.  I loved it!  Great service, good coffee and I was supporting local business.  Recently, the service has gone way down hill.  I never know what I'm going to get or how long I will be there when I stop in. In September it took over 20 minutes to get a medium iced latte. In October I ordered an medium iced skinny vanilla latte, got the drink and it was super light so I double checked that it was skim milk and was assured that it was.  Turns out the reason my drink was so light is because there was no espresso in it!  Just skim milk and sugar free vanilla syrup, which was gross and disappointing. Today they completely forgot my drink!  I was trying to be patient... there were two drinks ahead of mine and when people that came in after me were getting their drinks, I asked about mine and they found it on the back counter.  I was so disappointed!  I really like the coffee but the service is really bad!!   The only time I'm guaranteed great service is when Ahmed is there."}
{"text":"Not all lattes are created equal and black cat is doing it right! Hands down this is my go to iced latte home and you can't beat their prices. Perfect location for meetings and studying/working. I love that their front door is always open to enjoy our amazing Arizona weather."}
{"text":"They make a good cup of black coffee and seltzer water on ice. Very convenient location for Arcadians."}
{"text":"I go out of my way to come here because they have everything I want in a coffee shop: 1) great coffee, tea, and food, 2) friendly and genuine baristas, 3) fast Wi-Fi, 4) nice vibe."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and even better coffee and breakfast sandwiches. A very pleasant surprise. The guac sauce is legit."}
{"text":"Excellent french press coffee and the nicest service."}
{"text":"This was quite a nice little coffee shop on the East side of Phoenix. I met my friend there for a quick visit. It was a nice day , so we sat outside. Our coffees were great,nice and strong ,but not bitter. Customer service was very good , as well as they place was well laid out and clean. Quite busy as well for the middle of the day. So that is saying something. Since there is lots of competition around. Lots of Coffee and Tea drinks as well as Juice and water. They have Pastry and the usal fare that you find in a Coffee Shop. Nice vibe as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious coffee.  I have consistently received delicious coffee from here.  I will go out of my way, passing several other shops to be served here.  I typically get a Med extra shot whole milk iced latte with irish cream. . . . .SCRUMPTIOUS!"}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and don't have internet yet so I decided to come hang out and get a coffee. A friend had unexpectedly showed up so I decided to get a sandwich. It was an ok coffee shop sandwich..... A couple bites into it I pulled out a piece of a plastic glove, like they had ripped off the finger of the glove and laid it with the turkey. This was in my mouth. So effing GROSS! Only giving2 stars because the coffee was decent.  I do appreciate the apology email received from management."}
{"text":"Really love that I have a coffee shop I can walk to so close to my apt. Very nice small quiet place. I enjoy the art and there are usually people here studying or working. I like that they have a reward punch card so you can earn free drinks! I love their iced teas... Not too crazy about the coffees, they are ok. Also a great place to stop in real quick for a bagel or yogurt."}
{"text":"I happened to stop by during the monthly high school music night which was great. Really nice crowd of kids and parents. However, this is a coffee place and just that wasn't so great. I drink it black and, as a true addict looking for the next fix, am not picky but it just didn't taste right. Weird even. Bummer."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee shops in the valley. My drink of choice is the B-Cat Bomb and it's absolutely delicious. I would recommend anyone to give this local coffee shop a shot!  Love ya Tanya!"}
{"text":"A great cafe.  A welcome surprise to find in Phoenix.  Local, good coffee, friendly service, good ambience, free wifi.  That's what I'm looking for in a cafe when I'm hitting the computer.  I was glad to meet and chat with Don, the owner, both times I visited.  The prices are a little higher than that chain coffee place that shan't be mentioned, but if that's enough to keep you away, this place ain't for you anyway.  I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"The first time I went here I got a cappuccino and it tasted burned and most of it was foam.  The second time I went here I got a cappuccino and this time it was better, it had less of a burned flavor and more coffee this time.  Needless to say not sure ill be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place...their iced coffee with cream is wonderful!!  Their coffee is AMAZING!! The taste is like no other...it almost has this sweet quality to it.  They have huge cups that are great because I like to have biggest iced coffee possible!  They have a a great thai iced tea as well...you do not see that often at many places.  The people behind counter are so nice and friendly.  The first time I went there I spoke to the guy behind the counter for like 20 minutes.  He was awesome!  I wish it were on my way to work, but it definitely has become my weekend spot.  I go here about once a week!"}
{"text":"I don't usually make it to this part of town but when I do and I want coffee I usually come here. It's great to support a local business and they have really good coffee! Comfortable seating. Free wifi. What else do you really need?"}
{"text":"I went to Black Cat because there was no place to sit at work at Sip Coffee down the street. I know it is the summer time in Phoenix but it was really hot inside. Made it difficult to enjoy a hot coffee. It was also $5 for a latte, which seemed a bit excessive. Overall, would go back again, but I will not be making it a regular place."}
{"text":"Cappuccino wasn't very good. Zucchini bread tasted like homemade. Customer service was satisfactory. I will go back sometime for a different drink maybe cappuccino isn't specialty here."}
{"text":"I love having coffee and breakfast here, they are always really nice and the coffee and food never disappoints.  The owner is around a lot and is very friendly and talkative, he creates a great vibe in his shop."}
{"text":"Favorite coffee shop in Phoenix right here. Where do I begin with my love for this place? Their iced toddy is mind-blowing. No coffee has ever jump started my day the way this stuff does. It is smooth, delicious and full of caffeination.  This place gets major brownie points for having almond milk. Thank God I don't have to ever have another latte with dairy or soy. Their iced chai with almond milk will change your life and it makes their toddy that much smoother.  Their food is delectable. They have Tammie Coe everything and if you haven't tried Tammie Coe cakes, you're missing out. I haven't tried a cupcake, muffin or breakfast sandwich I didn't like (make sure you try a breakfast croissant sandwich with turkey bacon. Earth shattering good.)  Last but definitely not least, their customer service is epic. I have the best convos with these guys and they're always ready to suggest good teas to match my mood or go above and beyond to make my drink perfect. They're like my neighborhood friends. What more could you ask for from a place? The owners of BCCH have done everything right!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at BCCH. Such a relaxed atmosphere with good music. The barista was really sweet when I explained I had just moved to Phoenix and didn't know what to order. She asked me what I normally get and suggest the Iced Thai Tea. Bullseye. Will be coming back to escape the heat this summer."}
{"text":"Just did a quick stop for coffee on way to pedicure (my lady friend's idea.  I feel dirty admitting this).  Anyways, very cool venue.  Open air access to outside.  Plenty of seating.  Fast service and excellent coffee (I got a red eye, did its job in waking me up).  Definitely the kind of place I would hit up regularly if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"Really cool place with great ambiance. Kids were welcome (even though mine are a bit loud) and even though they were busy, they were friendly and made my drink to perfection. The number of choices is astronomical. I put Black cat up there with Grinders in the West side."}
{"text":"Was in here earlier this morning with my girlfriend as we just moved a mile away! The location is cool and they are pet-friendly (as in bring your dog inside so we can say hello to them -AND- we have a big ol' water bowl outside for your pup too!). Beyond impressed with the service we received from the two ladies and their recommendations were on point as I died over my large, iced vanilla and caramel macchiato! I didn't pay much attention to their selection but I can vouch that they could probably make you any combination of drink with their many, many options! Will be back and I'm now using my Starbucks gift card as a bookmark haha! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Glad to see a nice, friendly coffee shop open in Arcadia. Their big, open front doors are especially nice for sipping a coffee in the early morning during the Fall.  They use locally roasted coffee (Passport) and locally baked pastries. A nice selection of teas as well, including Thai iced tea, which I don't often see on coffee shop menus.  Staff is very friendly, but they are still learning and there are some consistency issues. I like cappuccinos and no two people there seem to make them the same way. But their official Grand Opening isn't until Halloween, and it always takes new places a while to work out the kinks. Hoping for great things!"}
{"text":"Black Cat Coffee House is one of the chill tiny coffee shops in Arcadia. They have good cold brew! They have seats and couches, so whichever way you want to chill with your coffee!"}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance! The vanilla latte is a bit sweet but still great. The best thing about this cafe is that it has a silent TV on during Sundays that allows you to keep tabs on the sports games without having to stop your reading. Multitasking at its best! Favorite coffee shop in Phoenix so far."}
{"text":"It's a nice and relaxing environment. I like how open it is and that it's close to where I work.  They don't have much of a selection when it comes to pastries but the vibe is great."}
{"text":"Woof! This cat has bark. On a nice day they keep the tall double doors open - lots of fresh air and that inside/outside zibe which more shops should do in Phoenix during the amazing weather in the winter months.   The Black Cat Melt wasnt for me. It was a underfilled and over salty. The coffee is very good. The WiFi is fast, over 20 on a speed test. Background music is pleasant. Great place to park yourself to get some work done."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to hang out, read a book, have a muffin & a latte. Aside from peak hours it's pretty quiet - lots of people on their laptops working or lounging and reading the paper.   Black Cat is truly a local gem. I adore most local spots but this is a nice break from the hipster snobs/atmosphere. It is simply homey. The perfect lil' hideout."}
{"text":"Ended up here on a slow President's day. Just wanted to try an Iced Mocha and it was good, lots of mocha flavor and choice of milk at the counter. The medium size is actually pretty big, so a small might work as well. They have a few rickety tables outside next to overflowing garbage cans, so you can sit outside, but most hang indoors. I like black cats, so this place is a natural, but I do not think any of pastries are baked here."}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop. I haven't tried the food yet but I can vouch for the coffee, the ambiance, and the music selection. If the food is decent, they'll definitely get a star upgrade."}
{"text":"I usually head to Scottsdale or downtown to study, but am excited to find a place in the Arcadia neighborhood that gets a good crowd, has great food, coffee & vibe, excellent service - and I don't have to fight to find a seat every time I go. I'm definitely going to be a regular."}
{"text":"Coffee was ok -- got an iced mocha. The ambience, however, was not of my taste -- punk/screamo music is not what I expect at a coffee place."}
{"text":"Great place. Nice vibe. Staff was extremely kind and coffee was yummy.   The only drawbacks is that their coffee sugar station didn't have any cream, it appears to be something you have to ask for. I suppose this is to prevent it from getting too warm.  Second is that they have 2 kinds of tables. Tiny ones that are more or less for one person and a couple of very large ones for 6 people or more. When me and my buddy wanted to pull out our laptops and get some work done, we couldn't fit at a small table (unless we each sat at different tables) so we decided to try one of the larger tables. The place was so busy that we felt awkward for using such a big table for just the two of us and we were getting a few snarky glances from other customers, so ultimately we just left."}
{"text":"Great coffee, fun atmosphere, friendly staff. I love coming here to study or to just hang out. I especially love their croissant sandwich. Yum!"}
{"text":"Everyone should try it at least once, odds are you'll be back again and again! The coffee is strong and the decor is industrial chic, the service is always fantastic! I honestly have nothing bad to say that's why I drive all of the way from Chandler, my husband teases me about how many coffee houses I pass on the way but I'll always be back for more black cat!"}
{"text":"this coffee shop better than brother coffee but that starbucks coffee worse worse than world yuck really bad and weak, love this black cat house coffee."}
{"text":"what a plesant suprise .. great new clean coffee house, FINALLY a selection of \" Sugar Free\" coffee drinks ! and they use local blends ,   fresh local pastry . and the Owners are awesome and there to greet you !  I'm a fan now... not another \" over priced\" coffee house, just right !     welcome to Our Arcadia neighborhood"}
{"text":"I was in the Safeway parking lot near this place and needed a cup of coffee. Instead of the run-of-the-mill Starbucks stop,  I wanted to hit up a local place.   As soon as I got in, I immediately liked the atmosphere. It's a nice, cozy little place. There was local art hanging on the walls. The place had some indie-rock over head which I liked too.  Whenever I go into a locally owned coffee shop, I've come to expect a stuffy, pretentious, hipster-like aura (i.e., LUX on Central Ave and Campbell), but this place was very inviting.   About a month ago I changed my diet to not include any flour, dairy or radically processed foods.   This meant that I had to say no to lattes and only drink black coffee. I'm allergic to almond and soy products, so I can't drink almond or soy milk lattes.  That's why I was  very glad  to see they offered rice milk lattes at a reasonable price! I'm glad I stopped here, because at any other coffee place I'd have to just drink black coffee. I was also very good.  They also had some pretty good looking treats on display, but sadly I couldn't eat any of it.   The staff was pretty nice too. I'd definitely come back to this place!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot to hang out and just relax in my neighborhood. I am currently away from Arizona and find myself missing the Black Cat.  I highly recommend giving this coffee house a try.  Very friendly owners and staff, great coffee and lunch / snacks."}
{"text":"I literally live around the corner and had not been to Black Cat yet!! I've heard SO many amazing things about it and have been meaning to stop in but a busy schedule got the best of me. I was craving a refreshing beverage today since our summer heat is in full swing and popped in to get an iced tea. Not only did they have iced tea, they had tropical!! MY FAVORITE. It was so tasty and their large was massive {watch out AJ's, you have some serious competition!}.   The employees were so friendly and even had me sample a new iced tea that they'll be coming out with. I can't wait to come back and order that one! :) I will also be back to try their coffee beverages as well. I believe I saw a flavor that had chocolate covered strawberry in the title?! UM, yes please! See you soon, Black Cat! {Shame on me for not getting in here sooner!}"}
{"text":"This place is so cute. Great coffee, great food, great people, dog friendly, love it."}
{"text":"I had a great first time experience at Black Cat Coffee. They are a local coffee shop located in the Arcadia area. My first impression is that the staff was just great. They were very informative and made me feel at home. I love the overall feel to the coffee shop and my latte was perfect. Black Cat uses local products and is very involved in the community."}
{"text":"If you enjoy tea they have quite an exotic collection of tea. I personally enjoyed a plane old Chai Tea which was made perfectly and wasn't too hit where I couldn't drink it at the moment it arrived. I didn't have a chance to try the coffee but I bet it's just as good as their tea."}
{"text":"Arcadia needed this coffee house!  Hava Java married Coffee Bean!  First, let me admit that I drink a lot of coffee, specifically flavored lattes.  Daily, sometimes more than once a day, I will visit Starbucks, LGO, Hava Java, or Carmel's.  Black Cat is similar to Hava Java: large patio doors that open up during cooler weather, inviting interior with artwork, music playing, and cute baristas.  Black Cat has more seating than the closest Starbucks at 44th and Hava Java.  It's way quieter than LGO or Starbucks.  It has able wall outlets vs Hava Java.  It has two leather chairs!  Which, if they put 2 or 3 more sets (or leather love seats) where some of the bistro tables are, would make me rate this SIX STARS.  I give it four stars because it recently opened and this business could go to 5 or 3 over the next 6 to 9 months.  If they pull this Hava Java meets Coffee Bean off, it will compete with the best of them.  Yay!  I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I like this place. I don't frequent the locally owned coffee shops as much as I used to but I will for sure return to this one. This place doesn't have the pretentiousness you find at Echo or Lux (ugh Lux) and that's what I like. I am comfortable when I walk in and the baristas are friendly. I also thought the prices were fair and they surprisingly have a good selection of pastries, desserts and even in-house sandwiches. They also have smoothies and blended drinks which is why I will be dropping by a lot in the summer. So if you want good coffee (or a smoothie) without \"the scene\", then the Black Cat is your place."}
{"text":"I was not impressed i had a blended coffee and they were out of half of what was needed for my order the guy who was there was not even interested in suggesting another coffee i might like he also had the BALLS to tell me that they were closing  That is just not the way you should talk to a customer"}
{"text":"Black Cat is a wonderful beginning to the morning. It's small but have indoor and outdoor seating for opening your laptop and checking emails with coffee and some sunshine.  Friendly staff and great coffees and teas. Also highly recommend a breakfast sandwich while you're there."}
{"text":"An interesting place.  The reviews were overwhelmingly positive, with a few dissenters.    My experience?  The baristas are friendly without being cloying.  I don't have a complicated coffee drink, but my black drip was perfectly acceptable.  The space is neat and clean.  The WiFi is crazy fast, which is a big plus for me.    Black Cat will be in my regular rotation."}
{"text":"Cute coffee shop in the Arcadia area. The coffee is tasty and the barista can make almost any kind of coffee you can dream up. This place is busy in the morning so give yourself an extra couple minutes. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"All I can say love Black cat coffee house best moracan mint tea in the valley of the sun!!"}
{"text":"Lovely ambiance in this Arcadia shopping strip. They did away with the traditional storefront and installed a beautiful accordion door that really opens the space up. This creates a lovely atmosphere for the patrons and as well the workers! Workers are super friendly and always have a smile on their face. Great coffee and pastries. This is a great neighborhood coffee house if you live in the Arcadia area, or work near by. I recommend the French Press  with the Vanilla Cinnamon Twist bean!  Will come here often!"}
{"text":"Adorable, friendly, innovative and with a great neighborhood feel. A cozy place to hang out or get some work done!"}
{"text":"I love the breakfast sandwich with turkey! The egg is fluffy and plentiful. Everything that comes in it is just right! I never get a chance to take a picture of this marvelous creation, because I get too excited and gobble it down..."}
{"text":"Will go out of my way for black cat! The espresso they use has really strong berry undertones that compliment any of the many, many flavors you can add to your drink if you choose. Baristas are really down to earth and helpful. And I can leave with a Giant iced drink, can't complain."}
{"text":"I came to this coffee shop because on Saturday at noon to study, and I am super glad I did because it has free wifi and tables with outlets for charging laptops and phones. There are also couches to sit on and relax if you prefer it over the woode and leather chairs. The music they played was very relaxing indie style tunes, which complemented the studying well enough for me.  I also decided to order their Turkey Bacon Wrap with Granola and Yogurt for lunch when I got hungry. The wrap was cooked well and came with a hearty amout of eggs and tomatoes. The yogurt with granola was smooth and crunchy, just the way I like it. The meal portion was very fair for the relatively cheap price I paid.  This is definitely a place I would return to for future studying!"}
{"text":"Ownership has changed here and for the better! About a year ago, the original owner Don sold it to some guy who had no idea what he was doing, and now it's changed hands again...but this time, these new owners are taking great pride in Black Cat and to giving their customers supreme and speedy service with a smile!   Black Cat continues to be a phenomenal place to grab your favorite caffeinated beverage, and they also offer delicious snacks and savories. The zucchini bread is outstanding. Be sure to try their Thai iced tea (which you can get with non-fat milk instead of cream if you're watching your calories like me)...super yummy! Their hot chocolate is also to die for.   The new owners also do a fantastic job and keeping Black Cat clean and cozy. They've brought in some nice new art work to spruce up the surroundings.   Black Cat is still the best independent coffee establishment in the Valley. Be sure to check it out! :-)"}
{"text":"LOVED their blended iced coffee. I watched the manager train a new employee and I could see he was very dedicated and passionate. He even told my girlfriend and I to taste our drinks and make sure we liked them since it was our first time visiting from Chicago. It doesn't get much better than that!!"}
{"text":"Coffee was super strong and like warm, but on top of all that the gal that I asked to have a different cup of coffee acted like she had to pack up and travel to Ethiopia.  She literally sighed and rolled her eyes.  Rumor is this small place is struggling,  now I know why.  I'll take my business next door or down the street, definitely not here where the coffee sucks AND the staff are rude."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just returned from 2 weeks in Phoenix.  The Black Cat was the closest coffee house to our rental. We loved everything about it: great coffee, friendly staff, quiet atmosphere, and good WiFi.  We did not eat any meals there but the available food looked tempting."}
{"text":"I moved to the area over a year ago. Not to bash the other shops in this part of town but I do favor black cat over all of them. The atmosphere, cleanliness, MUSIC, friendly employees/owner, and a great breakfast bagel keep me coming back."}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast I've had at a coffee house. two scrambled eggs cooked perfectly on an asiago bagel - assembled just right so I could eat it without a mess. Came with a small simple parfait. It was well presented, too.  The mocha was a bit too sweet for me. Personal taste, I like a mocha to have a dark and earthy flavor."}
{"text":"First,  let me disclose, I'm not a coffee drinker. (But tea drinkers - I got you, no worries!)  But, don't let that stop you from reading my review or disregard my awesome rating of Black Cat Coffee House.  I have my reasons, I promise!   Read on...   I LOVE this place!   After 8 years of graduate school visiting many, many coffee shops throughout Tempe, Scottsdale and Phoenix - this is THE place I've been searching for all my life!  (or at least my academic life!)    Free internet makes for a productive work day and with Over Easy next door, there's great people watching for the casual coffee-goer too!   So, why does a non-coffee drinking coffee-shop hopping academic have to say about this place?  So many things!  where to begin?    The tea choices...ahh, the tea choices!!!  It's as though I found the end of the rainbow - tea lovers rejoice, b/c this is the place to go for our \"pot o' gold\" (in the form of many, many delicious flavors of tea.)   My favorite:  Cactus Blossom.  I like it iced.  Get it. And I highly recommend you just go ahead and get the medium or large, because I suspect you'll love it as much as I do!   So many other delicious choices - even for people who aren't hardcore tea-drinkers - you'll even find something you love here!!!   Maybe the kiwi-strawberry iced tea as a cool alternative for the summer months?  or Passionfruit.    They also have many more traditional and non-traditional tea flavors.  So many choices, what to do??!?    Also  - my friends who are crazy coffee-aholics like to the coffee here, so while I cannot personally validate it, I would tend to believe them.   Second reason I love this place: the lighting!   As anyone who spends much time in coffee shops may have realized, often coffee shops are dark.  I like sunshine.  I do live in Phoenix, after all!   There are tables outside and inside, the doors fold wide open and plenty of light gets in, so even if you are slaving away over a paper or dissertation, you'll still soak up some Vitamin D and feel like you are in the land of the living.   Third reason:  I haven't eaten there yet, but I'm super impressed with food options.  Here's what I've discovered in my coffee shop days - the food is either uber healthy, made for the granola-earth biscuits out there who just rode their bicycle 60 miles in the 115 degree sun to stop in and pick up a green tea, 3 carrot sticks and a vegan cracker for dessert.  (nothing wrong with that, just not everyone's thing)  OR on the other hand, it's a giant double-sized triple chocolate cheesecake, massive bearclaw with a side of donut holes, and a caramel-chocolate-raspberry muffin, which has the caloric equivalent of 6 Big Macs \"super sized\".  So - if you want something more than a seaweed cracker, but don't want to gain 15 lbs from a muffin, this place gets it done.   You can choose from a variety of healthy food options, hot or cold breakfast/lunch items, and if you do feel like splurging - they do have some tasty pastries of normal portion sizes to try too!   Last - the staff are all friendly and welcoming.  The owner or manager (not sure) has personally stopped by each time I've been there to say hi and check in on how things are.   The place is immaculately clean and the music is mellow and relaxing. The hours are excellent.     Oh - and tax is included, so the price you see is what you pay.  That's a pretty cool difference from most places!   And drinks are affordable!!    So, stop by - I'll be the one basking in the sunshine in the corner -  just don't take my spot!   =)"}
{"text":"There's a cool cat in town and it's known as Black Cat Coffee House. All they need is some live jazz playing and they'll be set. I wouldn't have expected a cool coffee shop like this to be living in the Safeway shopping center, but it's a great fit! This coffee shop isn't big, but there's enough room to sit and do some work if you want. The menu is a good size for the coffee shop. They offer pastries, a hefty selection of coffee (including a tasty sounding Iced Toffee Mocha!), freshly made loose leaf hot or iced teas and even a couple meal options like a hefty salad or sandwich. I will definitely be back to try more items on their menu, but during my first visit, I enjoyed a refreshing (and quite large) iced tea. It was naturally sweetened and they have about 12+ flavors to choose from. I opted for a berry flavor which I liked. This is definitely a great spot to relax, work or have a meeting!"}
{"text":"There's a rush of high school students that show up at about 2 when the school across the street lets out. I would recommend not coming at this time or anytime after that. They are very loud and trash the place and sometimes the mess sits for hours after the kids have left. Generally speaking the staff does nothing about it. They have a little sign on the wall that says \"seating for customers only\" but don't enforce it.   Outside of that annoying bit, I really like the place. Small and quiet with a great atmosphere. They offer great teas and coffee for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Love! Barista was so nice and accommodating (I am dairy and sugar free) and was able to recommend something tasty for me. She brought out our coffee to our table even though other customers were waiting to be helped. Definitely a great experience - and great coffee! Will be back"}
{"text":"I have to add that this place is so chill and mellow and never too crowded. I get SO much work done when I come here and jump on the lap top without a loud crowd to distract me. Sundays here may become a weekly ritual!"}
{"text":"love black cat. it's cute, all the baristas are really sweet, they have a punchcard, they are pretty close to my house... the drinks are awesome! (i only get dirty chais and lattes)  i've had a breakfast croissant here, and it was super tasty and filling. yummmm!  my favorite mommy-alone-time thing to do is to grab a drink to go and enjoy it while i get my nails did at the salon on the corner."}
{"text":"I've been in here a couple of times and haven't been too excited about either visit.  On the positive side, the workers have been friendly and helpful.  The coffee is about average but each time my drip coffee wasn't as warm as I'd like.  On the negative side, the pastries are really weak.  I'm not sure where they bring the pastries in from, or if they are leftover from the previous day, but I've seen better at Costco."}
{"text":"Quite pleasant, and I don't even drink coffee. Starbucks rushes you. This does not. Unwind and talk. The prices were fair and the atmosphere was comfortable."}
{"text":"This is a great little place the problem I have is it looks too much like a Starbucks but it is nice lot of younger people college students using the wifi drinks were reasonable, sandwiches and desserts are good at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've come back a few times and have had great service since.  I'm gonna call my first visit here a fluke.  I love this place, I wish it were closer to my home in Ahwatukee.  Lavender vanilla lattes?  So wonderful."}
{"text":"Sorry for the late review guys, I'm a manny by profession and an at home chef so my free time is random. I do though remember well my visit. I ordered their house protein coffee shake. The environment is a little hip place, maybe too hip for me but to each they own. They were very professional and friendly and greeted us immediately. I took my order to go, so I can't really say much on how the atmosphere really sets in but I'll have to sit and relax there when I can. Good coffee, pretty cool place, I'll be back."}
{"text":"You know that movie where the guy hangs with the cute girl next door, who he likes and she treats him well, but still can't fight the allure of the sexier, fancier, stylish girl from the expensive neighborhood who treats him - not as well, only to finally realize he should have stayed with the girl next door from the beginning? That's how I feel about this place - the time and money I spent at other places was wasted and I should have just stayed close to home, where I was happy. I'm no coffee/tea aficionado, but I like it here, the staff is great, it's comfortable and the food is pretty good. My only \"complaint\" is that the WI-FI can be spotty sometimes, but after a router reset it's great. Save your time and money, come to this cool neighborhood coffee spot."}
{"text":"I was craving an almond milk latte and came across this highly rated spot on Yelp. The latte was bitter and the almond milk overly sweetened. The baked goods looked unappealing-- somewhat similar to Costco. If it weren't for the friendly barista, I would give this place a 1."}
{"text":"Cool place to study. Coffee is delicious and the service is top notch. Love the ambiance here. It can get a little on the crowdy end. I would have given it 5 stars if they had black cats welcomed me in."}
{"text":"I liked it the first trip. Got a thai tea and was happy with the service. Second trip ruined it all. Poor service. Horrible coffee. I wrote a review on their facebook they they promptly deleted."}
{"text":"I have to update my review from a 4 star to a 5 star.  You never know what you have until you can compare it to something else -kind of like dumping the nice, smart guy to see what else is out there because you think the relationship is just \"good\", but maybe not good enough.  You start dating a hot badboy and well, you realize the grass is not always greener on the other side. So what if they got six pack abs?! They got nothing to stimulate you mentally. You'd rather just be looking at them instead of conversating with them.  ha.  Well, what I realized is Black Cat is the nice, smart guy that I left thinking there was something out there that is better.  My review before was me being a high-maintenance snot.  After two months of trying different coffee spots, I always seem to go back to Black Cat.  I will make the drive just to get the coffee (10 minutes).  It's insanely addicting and the flavor is ridicuously good.  I've compared Black Cat's coffee to at least 4 or 5 different places and Black Cat is always ranked number one.    Now that the weather is nice, they opened up the doors to make the shop look bigger and open.  I only wish Black Cat was closer to home or maybe I can just move so I am closer to Black Cat...OR maybe Black Cat and I can move in together.    Love you, Black Cat."}
{"text":"Very cool, great energy, great feel to this positive space. That along with great coffee is a winner!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere/decor. Only issue I have is  the music was too loud to work comfortably in my opinion."}
{"text":"Great cold brew! Okay food. The times I've been there, there's only been about 2 people working, so service has been slow, which is a downfall for a coffee shop and people like myself who are most often trying to get my fix and run! :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and his roommate turned me on to this coffee house, as they use to live just down the street from it and I am HOOKED now! I just recently moved to the area and adore this place. My favorite is their Black Cat Bomb which is an incredible protein/espresso shake that is super filling and delicious. They only serve it in a large though so make sure you have a little room for an appetite as it does fill you up but it's a perfect breakfast for me to go with a side of fruit or an in between meal drink when I need a little boost.  Staff=awesome! Food=awesome! Seating=comfy and awesome! All around= AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I love his little spot! The s'mores coffee blended is amazing! I also had a breakfast sandwich here and it was very delicious and affordable. It was a sandwich someone actually made it was not frozen like Starbucks sandwiches. The girls are also very sweet. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is the go-to spot for my boyfriend and I (and I like trying different places when I can, so that's saying something). We often hang out for hours, I writing on my laptop and he surfing on their wifi. The drinks are much more flavorful than big chain coffee shops, and they are local, which I love supporting. They also have a few things other cafes don't have, like Thai iced tea! Atmosphere is excellent, good music (mostly alternative), and still pretty relaxed even when they're busy. Best when it's comfortable temperature out and they have the front window open. Service has almost never been a problem, and the manager always says hi. If I have any \"dislikes\" would be that they have very little food, but only because I don't care for sandwiches, but what we've eaten there was good quality."}
{"text":"I really liked the interior and the vibe of the place. The prices were great too. Even my cheesecake slice was fantastic. My friend's pomegranate green iced tea was delicious. However, the espresso in my caffè macchiato (called an espresso macchiato on the menu) was awful - very sour and medicinal tasting. I'm not sure if it was a specific roast or if it was because we went late at night (nearly 9pm) but it was simply not good. I'd have to try it mixed in a drink but nearly plain, it was undrinkable. I had to force it down just to not feel like I was wasting."}
{"text":"Another long overdue review. I've been going to Black Cat for at least 18mos and these cats (heh - see what I did there?) are true aficionados when it comes to coffee. Their expertise, knowledge of their craft, and what's required to maintain the equipment all shows in the final product - the glorious coffee that's handed to the customer.   The products are amazing - if you're accustomed to crappy, yet overpriced, espresso that's regularly burned and then served with a smile from a well-known chain, you'll be more than pleasantly surprised by the natural toffee flavor that shines through their espresso. Getting a latte? The flavor is perfect without piles of whipped cream, sweeteners, and other sugar-laden additives.   There's also comfy seating indoors, outdoor seating that's dog-friendly (so go ahead and bring your furry friend with you), free wifi, yummy food, and an amazing selection of teas for the days you might want something that's not coffee. Their hours can't be beat, either."}
{"text":"I was beyond surprised by the quality of the tea here.  All I have tried so far is the tropical ice tea ,it was seriously the best tropical tea I have ever had! I would drive across town for a place like this, its not in Scottsdale sadly but I will make the trip back again. I stumbled upon this place by accident when I was in the area for work one day. Kudos to this place for using fresh tea leaves!"}
{"text":"I was meeting a friend later on for dinner in the area, and wanted to find a coffee shop nearby where I could get some work done. Upon entering the Black Cat, I immediately felt a peaceful vibe. I ordered a medium iced vanilla latte, and it was incredibly creamy and amazing. The medium was a large anywhere else, so you definitely get a lot for your money! The natural lighting and fresh air from the open doors was great. I live in Chandler but spend an unreasonable amount of time in coffee shops, so you can bet I will be back here often!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here late and just caught the owner closing up. He was super friendly and made us a decaf latte even though he was officially closed. Thank you and wish you the best with this great coffee shop!!"}
{"text":"Small and cute, cooler inside than it first appears since its in a little strip mall. Nice employees and good coffee. Feels very local in a world of big corporate coffee places. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"This place is a little more pricey than most, which is fine if the product was exceptional, but I was not impressed. To me, the coffee tasted watered down. I did like the ambiance and there were no problems with the service."}
{"text":"I had heard of this place before and was visiting a store in the same strip mall. I knew I had to try it, I love black cats! I ordered a Thai Iced Tea and it was delicious. The cashier asked me if I wanted a punch card (awesome, since most places I've been to don't ask and I find out later) and she gave me 2 stamps because it was my first visit. Too cool. It's not a convenient location for me but if I was in the area I'd stop by and try their coffee. Super nice staff and there was plenty of customers there enjoying themselves."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly  I ordered a Lavender Honey cafe latte delicious! Atmosphere casual"}
{"text":"Atmosphere/environment: hipster, tables AND couches, good working space  Price: tax included in the prices (which I personally love). Super reasonable prices for the amount you are getting   Coffee: they have several different flavors to choose from (including sugar free options). I think next time I will ask for less syrup than what they normally put, but I usually like things a little less sweet than most people"}
{"text":"I've stopped by three times. The first time I had French press flavored cover. Brew was well timed and very tasty. I had a muffin that was fresh and moist.   The second time I ordered a latte and croissant. The latte was done well. The croissant, while it had a good bread taste, was not the layer buttery taste I was looking for. (Recommended Essence Bakery in Tempe as an alternate source.)  Third visit was perfect. Cappuccino and Biscotti. Coffee roaster is locally sourced from Passport in Scottsdale. Biscotti is from Bad Boy Biscotti in Gilbert.   Service was very friendly. The same person made my coffee drinks each time, and the quality was consistent. The atmosphere is delightful with the open doors or outside tables and background music that doesn't over power conversation.   I'm giving five stars. I've been very pleased on each visit and I'm glad they've joined the Arcadia neighborhood."}
{"text":"THEY CLOSE AT 8PM NOT 10PM.... The staff was very cold to us. The beverages were great and fairly priced. But I felt sort of rushed because the employees started cleaning the shop up like they were closing but they didn't close for three more hours according to Yelp. Great wifi."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the Black Cat Coffee House! My dad and I discovered this gem through Instagram about two years ago. On Christmas morning we wanted a coffee and found out that BC was open! Ever since then I have ditched starbucks and dutch bros completely, they just don't compare! I love that BC has punch cards so I can earn free coffees, and I also like being able to call in an order if I'm in a hurry. The owners (Don and Tima) are incredible and very friendly. Every time I come in Don greets me and plenty of other customers by name. They truly care about their customers here and treat them like friends. I would definitely recommend the Black Cat to everyone, not just coffee lovers. They have lots to offer! :)"}
{"text":"I used to love this place but I really haven't gotten a good coffee here in a long time. :( We walk here often on weekends and have even tried to order a few different drinks but we have thrown out too many to be visiting again. Too bad because we really used to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"This coffee place is the opposite way of where I need to go normally and I drive here still every morning! The coffee is amazing, genuinely good coffee. The workers are nice as well!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since my first review, and as said before, my 4-star would probably change to 5.  And it has.  The few times I've been here since, I've taken a client here and been here with friends.  My time here with my client is what brings me back to update.  Sometime last year I brought a client here to enjoy coffee while her peers went out to see a movie.  Since this place has a huge window for a door, it was very easy to get in, which is saying something since she uses a wheelchair to get everywhere.  The baristas were very interactive with her and asked HER what SHE would like instead of looking at here chair and immediately asking me.  They gave her options for her coffee (light vs dark roast) and really listened to her.  They even told her their names when she asked.  I wasn't expecting much coming here, but the service she received was amazing.  Thank you so much for making her night.  Also, thanks for the sugar-free syrup options.  I hope Amaretto joins them, but for now, peanut butter will do."}
{"text":"I just wanted to write a quick update- I've now moved to Colorado but came back in town this weekend, and this place hasn't changed a bit. Same awesome, artsy atmosphere, very friendly staff, and delicious (well priced- haven't changed in all of these years!) coffee and tea drinks. Thank you Black Cat for everything over the last years :) Keep it up, and I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Whenever I'm in this area and want coffee (and I pretty much want coffee all the time) I stop in here. I think the only thing I've had is the iced coffee, but it's good. The large is super huge.  The staff here is friendly and the prices are actually pretty much on par w/the large chains, which isn't always the case w/small local places like this. I usually just pop in and out, but there's quite a few couches & tables, and it seems like a good place to hang out and get work done. They also do punch cards towards free drinks, which is always a good thing."}
{"text":"Oh my word!! I absolutely love this place ! Not just the drinks, but the staff is exceptionally remarkable! I used to and sometimes still make my coffee but since my boyfriend took me to this amazing coffee house, I just been addicted ! I'm a coffee-holic and extremely am picky with my coffee . Here they make such amazing coffees and the best and biggest Thai tea you can possibly find ! If i could rate it a 10 star I totally would!!! Thank you Black Cat Coffee for starting or ending my day in such awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I love coffee but don't know all the fancy terminology. The staff here is always so helpful and really seem to enjoy their jobs. The service is amazing and the coffee is fresh and hot."}
{"text":"It's an average coffee house. The coffee is decent. The pastry I got was stale. The atmosphere is quite nice, but not well laid out. I'm just glad it's not a Starbucks."}
{"text":"I use to get my nails done next door and my highlight was to get a mint tea from Black Cat. Still the best mint tea ive had"}
{"text":"We came here after eating a large dinner last weekend. I love a hot mint tea after experiencing a food coma. My boyfriend got a black coffee which I tried and it was also delicious. I could see this being a great spot for studying or catching up with a friend."}
{"text":"I've decided: Black Cat is the best-kept breakfast secret. Their egg sandwiches (which you can get on a bagel, croissant or in a wrap) are out of this world. You get your choice of breakfast meat, tomato and/or cheese and they are HUGE. Paired with their absolutely delicious iced coffee, I'm not sure why the chumps waiting outside of Over Easy don't just come in here. (More room for us, hooray!!)"}
{"text":"Super chill spot to grab a (delicious) iced tea on a warm day--the apricot is recommended! I'd recommend the patio however, may be less mousey."}
{"text":"First time in and it was great. Excellent prices and incredible sizes. Got a Thai iced tea and it was above par. They have a ton of alternative dairy options. Check it out!"}
{"text":"I really dislike giving anything lower than 3 stars but I feel I need to address today's experience... I like coming to Black Cat Coffee House for the ambience, the thai iced tea, and the internet when I need it...  I have been here several times and have had enjoyable experiences However, today I walked in and found a seat near the coffee bar... I had some work to do and I got some water... I didn't plan on getting coffee or something to drink for a while, as I had drank so much coffee in the morning... The workers were nice and asked if I wanted anything, I politely told them that I was going to have water for now but then eventually get something a bit later... I sat down for about 10 minutes when another man came in, not sure if he is the manager or owner...  He came over and checked on me to see if I needed anything... At first, I thought he was being polite and exhibiting exceptional customer service, but really he was trying to make me buy something... a drink or anything... I get that I am here using the WIFI, but I recently told the workers that I was going to buy something eventually.... and as a regular, I feel a little uneasy about being forced to purchase something just to use the WIFI... I get it, as a small local business, you WIFI is not free and people shouldn't come in to just use it... So I am not sure if they get a lot of people who just come in for WIFI, but there are also signs that sort of say WIFI is for paying customers... So I think I got the memo... After this exchange I just feel a little weird and now I feel really pressured into buying something... As a small business owner, I think you live and die off of customer service and although I may be only one person, it just sort of rubbed me in the wrong way...  I will continue coming to Black Cat and hoping that I don't get pressured into buying something as soon as I walk through the doors... I do have the memo that WIFI is not free, so maybe next time I will just buy something and throw it away... just to make it clear that I am making a purchase...   3 stars is not bad, but I will give it a couple of more trys, which could lead to an updated higher review...  I guess it's time for me to get up and buy a Thai Iced Tea..."}
{"text":"With so many great coffee places in Phoenix, how to choose the right one for the time of day and your current mood is hard.  It was almost 6 p.m. when I popped into Black Cat with a group of four, all yelpers, all begging for a hit of caffeine. Our barista was on his game. He created a caramel latte for me with only one pump of caramel and almond milk. Great flavor and it hit the spot perfectly.   Tip: grab a punch card!"}
{"text":"Great spot! I've personally had iced tea and their incredible fruit smoothies. I even have a loyalty punch-out card that I remember to bring everytime. I hate those things, so that's saying a lot. Try their blueberry, strawberry, banana smoothie with a scoop of protein (boyfriend's favorite). Or mine: mango blueberry smoothie. So refreshing and lactose free. Healthy summer treat. The owner is there often and is a friendly local guy. The only annoyance is it's located just down the street from a high school. So don't hope for a quick drink right after school. Lots of high school kids ordering sugar filled frozen coffee drinks and with 1 or 2 people behind the counter, it could take 15 minutes to get anything more complicated than a regular coffee. But all in all, great place!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little shop, truly a place to go and hang out to relax and read, have a business meeting, or just grab your favorite beverage.  The staff is wonderful and friendly and truly welcomes you in.  I just adore this place"}
{"text":"Very nice staff. Cool vibe. Great area (Arcadia). Will come here again.  Coffee was good too"}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place after getting my fingerprints done next door. The garage door was open on this lovely spring day, and the big open hole in the shopping mall makes you go \"Oooh, what is THIS?\" and want to go inside, so in I went.  The mocha I got was amazing. The espresso has that nutty flavor and the chocolate was richer than most places. It was so good that I returned the next day... and the next day... at this point, I'm driving from Scottsdale out to Arcadia, bypassing at least 5 other coffee joints, just to go to Black Cat. It's that good.  On the subsequent visits, I got their toddy; WOW. I generally can't drink coffee with no sweetener, but this toddy was awesome. It wasn't bitter and was delicious with just a bit of milk. And the caffeine! I'm almost immune to caffeine at this point in my college career, but half of a large toddy kept me wide awake and productive from about 8pm untill after midnight. Schwing!  The atmosphere is really really cool; no hipster vibe at all, lots of young professionals working. They have dog water bowls outside, and yesterday there was a guy with his German Shepherd pup sound asleep on the floor next to him; it was adorable and so cool that they were allowed to sit just inside the garage door and nobody was spazzing out. There's art and music without being overpoweringly hipster snob. The staff are really sweet and laidback; the one guy says \"No worries!\" to everything.   They have a punch card deal too, and it's buy 9, get one free, not buy 10 like everywhere else. Winning!  The triple berry parfait I had yesterday afternoon is the only thing I'm knocking down stars on; it didn't feel as ice cold as a dairy product should, and that made me wonder if it had been kept at the \"safety zone\" temperature. The yogurt was kind of watery, not the thick consistency you'd expect, and some of the berries were mush essentially. It was delicious until about halfway through when it turned very acidic-tasting... and I got heartburn (which I NEVER get) after eating it.  I think I will stick to the very scrumptious-looking cakes and muffins from now on, because this parfait was iffy."}
{"text":"Since the ownership change, this place really sucks. I'm going to LGO. The place isn't that busy and it's been 10 minutes for 1 coffee and an iced dirty chai. Ridiculous. New owner needs to pay Don a consult an straighten out."}
{"text":"It's coffee o'clock! Whether it's the morning or a late night, Black Cat will fix your caffeine needs.  I was looking for coffee once day and stumbled into Black Cat.  Great little coffee shop to sit back and kill some time.  They have a great menu for both coffee and eats.  I have not tried a pastry but they look amazing.  The coffee has a great smooth, flavor.  The vibe is pretty laid-back and they have TVs to offer some entertainment.  I love that they offer punch cards...not a lot of places do that."}
{"text":"Great new coffee house in Arcadia.  Nice selection of offerings.  My Vanilla latte was delicious.  Thanks for offering low-fat products.  Saw some other patrons having some baked goods.  They looked appetizing. Service was great and the atmosphere was fun and inviting.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Cool barista willing to offer suggestions and then to make some very drinkable espresso concoctions. The atmosphere here on a Saturday late evening was quite eclectic.  This place is dog friendly, if you sit outside, and they even have a dog water bowl. Definitely worth a repeat visit, especially as it is open later than most coffee shops."}
{"text":"Very tasty coffee!!! They have a large variety of special drinks so if you're unsure you can just pick a pre made one. The service was friendly and helpful. They have art on the walls so you have something to look at while waiting on your coffee. They also have teas, some food, and pastries."}
{"text":"I definitely prefer to support the locally based economy.  But, $3 for a single cup of black coffee is a little much to ask...  Aside from that, it seems like a very nice little place."}
{"text":"Service was awful. I do not recommend, especially if you are grabbing breakfast on the go.   We waited over a half an hour for the girl behind the counter to make our breakfast sandwiches... she gave us our coffee on time but continued to serve people after us in line before completing our order... even when the shop cleared she just continued cleaning the bar and doing other tasks before even starting to make our sandwiches. We canceled our order and left. She came up with a lame excuse saying that the other worker didn't show up...doesn't mean you can't still complete our order. Because of this, we were late for work. This was completely unacceptable. Needless to say, we will never come back and give this company our business again."}
{"text":"This is a coffee shop with character. The owner is kind, keeps a clean shop, and makes a bomb Thai Iced tea from scratch.   Location: Like most places in Arizona, this coffee shop is located in a strip mall. There's a Safeway in the mall and a few restaurants as well. It's a great area to run errands in.   Atmosphere: It's a little dark in here, but not so much that you can't get work done. I generally prefer light and airy spaces, but Black Cat offers a different and just as appreciated environment. It's cozy here, and makes me wish that Phoenix had more rain so that I could curl up in a seat with a hot cup of tea, and listen to the rain drops.   There are also paintings on the walls done by local artists. The owner brings in new work every few months to change the mood.   Seating: there are high tops, and many low tables to sit at. I would go with a huge group, but 4-6 people would sit comfortably.   Drinks: I ordered the Thai Iced Tea- I didn't want a pre-mixed overly sweet drink however, so the owner made mine from scratch at the same price. It was an absolute STEAL. The only thing I would've had differently was putting simple syrup in my drink instead of the honey. I hadn't realized that there was simple syrup at the back of the cafe. The drink itself was strong and flavorful - a favorite for sure. $3.50 for a large.   ALSO: taxes are included in the price. Love it.   Service: the owner is a sweetheart, and apparently his wife makes the best playlists.   I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I had an almond milk tiramisu frozen coffee drink. They are only available in medium, but it was very good. They were very busy but the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"I went here today with my step mom for some coffee and it was surprisingly excellent! We both got the iced coffee and it was so good, I didn't have to add any milk or cream to drink it.  It was not acidic and was very smooth, with just enough coffee flavor. The feel here is nice, very relaxed. The prices are pretty average. I definitely want to come back and try a latte, but this place has serious 5 star potential!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday.  Nice place in shopping plaza with outdoor seating.  Coffee was good!  Worth the stop."}
{"text":"spent the whole day there working on my laptop. friendly ppl good music. chill atmosphere. flavors galore!"}
{"text":"Decent atmosphere. Friendly staff.   Cold brew was weak. The barista didn't know what a red eye was.   This is not a place for people who are really into good quality coffee, but it's better than some others."}
{"text":"Great service, clean quiet atmosphere and not corporate."}
{"text":"Black Cat was a great rest stop during a long bike ride. The wife and I made the trip over to OHSO from Peoria and ended up coming to Black Cat after seeing the long lines. The shop made a good cappuccino and great sandwiches. The staff let us refill our water packs (sorry we cleaned out your water twice!) and we were on our way home. I can easily see this being a rest stop for my 50-80 mile rides when I'd rather have light bites instead of a heavy meal."}
{"text":"Chill atmosphere with a cool theme.  Try an almond milk latte- the almond milk adds a perfect amount of sweetness so you don't need to add any sugar.  Also love the fact that they keep the doors open at night when the weather's nice so the restaurant is open to the breeze.  All they need is an actual pet cat to be the mascot of the store.  They'd get 100/5 stars from me for that."}
{"text":"I just quickly stopped in here on a whim to grab a snack to take with me. It was a pleasant little place where I just wanted to sit down for awhile, but my schedule wouldn't allow it. When I got home and had my bran muffin, it was to die for. Moist, lots of bran texture, and a nice glaze on it. In addition, it was huge, so I got to have the rest the next day!"}
{"text":"Always great service, great drinks, huge servings :) Every time we come we get a Vanilla Chai and a B-cat Bomb. Consistently top notch!"}
{"text":"Ok love this little, local coffee house.  Prices include tax & very are reasonable.  Try the iced chai latte!  They support local charities."}
{"text":"Wow -- I've found another great local coffee house! Being a grad student, coffee houses are my second home, and I much prefer the locally-owned type.   I found this place by accident one day on my way back to PHX from Scottsdale, along Indian School Rd. The name intrigued me and it was fairly hot outside, and a cold beverage was in order. The guy whipped up a perfectly blended mocha with coconut for me - YUM!    The interior is long and narrow, and kinda dark (which is fine with me, just mentioning it). The tables along the wall are the bistro/pub set type, which I really like. A sofa and a couple comfy-looking chairs are towards the front, along with 3-4 regular-height tables with four chairs each.   Black Cat has a frequent visitor program, so be sure to pick up a card at the register -- buy 9, get the 10th free. There's a little outside seating, and they have free Wi-Fi. Also, their prices up on the board already include AZ and PHX tax...I wish everyone in town did that.   Compared to other local coffee houses like Urban Beans that has a full-on breakfast/brunch/lunch menu, they have a couple of salad options and a few sandwiches. The baked treats in the counter look delectable. I'll definitely be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Such a cute shop! I wish I wasn't so far away though, the staff is always friendly and the drinks are great! I you don't like coffee they have a great variety of alternatives the staff is knowledgeable and it's an overall \"hip\" vibe. If you're near the Arcadia area check it out!"}
