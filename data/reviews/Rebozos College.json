{"text":"So one day I was asked to eat tacos allllll day, and to help judge 'Toronto's best taco' (for \"Taco Wars\"), and I can happy to say, ROBOZO's won!  I can tell you that their Beef Tongue taco is amazing and flavourful. And for those that say \"Ew, tongue!\" I would say- take a chance, it's delicious.  Anyway, this isn't meant as a plug for the show or anything, I just thought everyone should know they won this and you should definitely check them out :)"}
{"text":"There was a daily special for $1.50 chicken tacos, which is approximately half priced. They were very flavourful authentic tacos served with delicious salsa on the side. The nachos were also good, slightly spicy, also authentic style (not overly cheesy, lots of cilantro!) Will be eating here again to try the guacamole!"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food.... Would have liked a bit more spice, but I am a spice junkie.  The staff were very sweet.  Would go there again.  Excellent prices."}
{"text":"I came in as a world cup game was starting. The restaurant was almost empty. It took ca. 20mn for the staff to notice I was actually sitting there but that's ok because I was watching that game. I ordered a coke but no food. As my drink came the waitress told I HAVE to order food. As I said no thank you, i really don't want any food. But then the boss finally came to me telling i'll have to order food otherwise he's not making any money with me... Well, sure i'm gonna pay and leave then... The whole process took 45mn which was just perfect as I could watch the entire first half. Well i am just amazed how can you get kicked out of a bar/restaurant, even if you're ordering a drink (potentially could have been more) and not taking the seat of other customers... So for me, never again!! i'm pretty sure there are plenty of other friendlier bars in the area!"}
{"text":"Last week my girlfriend and I visited Rebozo's on College with a hankering for some Taco's. We arrived around 4ish and the restaurant was empty, which is no big deal because my stomach and I where in no mood to be waiting in a line. So we sat down and where quickly greeted and given menus by our server who also happened to be the cook and owner. The man's name escapes me but he was attentive and all around awesome considering he was filling all the positions at the time.  Now on to the food, one overall theme of this review is that everything was very very fresh. We started with an order of Guacamole and corn chips, both of which where plentiful and tasty. The salsa that came with the mild and the spicy where AMAZING. The spicy was really hot and packed with flavour, but that's kind of my style. And the mild salsa had a good kick and would definitely be a hit with anyone who doesn't like things too hot. If the restaurant sold it, I would have bought it then and there. As a definition of how good it was we had to get refills throughout the meal.  For main's she ordered a Chicken Tostada and I went with the Tacos. Now with the Taco's you get three in a serving. Something I really appreciated was that they have no problem letting you mix and match different types of Taco's for your order. So I got the Chorizo (Mexican sausage), Pollo (Chicken in tomato sauce and green sweet peppers), and Res (Shredded beef marinated in spices). The food came out rather quickly and we where soon stuffing our faces. The Tacos where amazing, all three. The standouts where the Chorizo and Res. All of which where very flavorful and fresh, both the filling and the tortillas. The Tostada was also quite good according to my girlfriend, I also stole a bite to see for myself and it was indeed!   A few bites and a few heaping dollops of Salsa later the meal was finished and I mean there was nothing left. We decided not to go for dessert as we where both quite full by this point. Instead I opted for a Jarrito, a Mexican soda. The Jarrito was amazing and I bought another for the road.  The pricing was very reasonable, $10 for the Taco's, $5 for the Tostada, $8 for the Guac (like I said there was alot), and $2.50 for the Jarrito. All and all a very awesome experience and I can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"Really great authentic mexican food. Try the cochinita pibil and the birria soup. Really nice!"}
{"text":"As you walk in you are welcomed with a lovely aroma of Mexican food. The owner is very friendly and welcoming. Right away he brought us water and was patient with our reviewing of the menu and ordering. Pricing is very fair. Will return when on college."}
{"text":"In a city with so many burrito options, there's no excuse for bad ones. I tried both the pork and beef burritos and found the meat bland, rice mushy, and overall bland and soggy.  To top it off, we were overcharged for our drinks. The waitress explained that the menu price for Coke is for cans (it only listed one price and we just asked for \"Coke\") and that the bottles cost as much as the imported Jarritos pops. I wouldn't mind the extra money if it were actually imported cane-sugar Coke but it wasn't. I wasn't going to fight over a couple bucks but suffice to say I won't be going back.  I was really hoping to find a great (licensed!) Mexican restaurant in the neighbourhood but sadly this isn't it."}
{"text":"Cute little place. Short list of tacos and appies. Good if you can't decide. I had the chorizo, tinga and beef tacos. They were all good. Very simple, dressed with a tiny bit of cilantro (could have been a bit more) and raw onion. Two hot sauces are brought to the table. Nice and simple here. I like it and will be back when I want a quick meal."}
{"text":"TIME is what you need when you come here. But it's worth it. Some may say the service brings new meaning to Lazy Mexicans -- but they are really just taking the time to make everything fresh! From the guacamole to the margarita, it's all done right before your eyes and it's worth the wait. The Tacos are good, and reasonably priced too. Just make sure you're not in a rush."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for authentic Mexican food. NOT La Carnita's! Food is priced fairly and they have beef tongue tacos! They also have amazing pork shoulder and chorizo tacos. Tried their guacamole and chips which was pretty solid too. Forget Sneaky Dee's and the like - this is the place you want to go!"}
{"text":"Wow, the guacamole. Wow, the guacamole.  Did I say I love Rebozos' guacamole?  It is made of avocado plus cilantro and a little bit of diced tomato and onion ONLY.  So undilute, so well worth the $8, so I am willing to trot all the way from Markham to downtown if I crave for guacamole.  My dining mate loves the tacos.   I am a fan of their burritos.  Their flavours are delicate.  Rebozos has a simple menu.  The pricing is very reasonable.  Most dishes are $10 and under.  Beer is $6.  Don't expect much on the interior decoration; there isn't much.  The original paintings are nice, though."}
{"text":"Hungry for some decent grub in the Bathurst and College hood, I jaunted with a friend into the near-empty Rebozos around 7:30 on a Saturday night, anxious yet kind of excited to dig into some authentic Mexican cuisine, having been hyped quite forcefully by a close Mexican friend as one of her favourite taco-joints in the city.  First off, we ordered the Guacamole and chips ($8). Arriving in a stone bowl, this was a well executed version of the much-beloved avocado dip, not too creamy and topped with onions and cilantro, we basically licked the bowl clean.   This Saturday night I had been craving a healthy dose of protein, and Rebozos certainly delivered. For $10 you'll get three tacos, which you can mix-and-match with a choice of full-flavored Chorizo, slow roasted Cochinitas pork, succulent beef tongue, slow cooked pork carnitas as well as chicken and shredded beef, which we omitted to try this night.  And these are certainly not your standard hipster-taco flour tortillas that are currently all the rage in Toronto foodie circles these days. Rebozos' corn tortillas are of a very pleasing consistency; chewy, yet addictive.   We finished off our meal, still floating on taco-cloud-nine, by sharing a hefty, substantial burrito with Cochinitas ($8), nicely grilled and sufficiently stuffed with rice, meat, beans, cilantro and sour cream.  Rebozos on College has yet to receive their liquor license from the city, but they currently have the requisite array of Mexican sodas, Jarritos and virgin cocktails.  It's always a pleasure to have a satisfying experience at a great restaurant before it gets buoyed by hype. I'm not sure this iteration on College will go through the foodie buzz machine the way Grand Electric and the nearby La Carnitas have, but I'll certainly be back for more, knowing that if I have to wait in line for tacos, they'll be good ones."}
{"text":"best tacos in town! mmmm, wish i was eating some right now. wonderful service too!"}
{"text":"The tacos are good. I expected more because the won the taco war. I am from Mexico and I had high expectations. My GF liked the food. The service was bad eventho we were the only ones there. the food was cold. Cold tacos are not tasty.   The place is worth to give it a try. The dessert was good. I might come back."}
{"text":"In a city with so many Taco spots springing up, I had high hopes for some no nonsense authentic Mexican food.  Imagine my crushing defeat when all I got were oily, bland, tepid tacos. The heartburn after was a nice touch. Save your money and go to El Trompo instead.  I award Rebozos no stars, and may god have mercy on their souls."}
