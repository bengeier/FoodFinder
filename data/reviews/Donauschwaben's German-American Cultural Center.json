{"text":"I used to come here quite often for lunch. I don't Come quite as often because every time I go there I am disappointed. Steve the chef left and the new chef really has a hard time with German classics. He really needs to learn how to make chicken paprikash. I had it last week and it was gross. It was a pile of shredded chicken tossed on top of Spaetzel. Very little sauce, no sour cream. The smoked pork chop used to be outstanding. The last time I had it, it seemed they just dumped apple cider over it and called it \"sauce\". It was awful. To make matters worse their prices have doubled in two years.  The beer is still good and reasonably priced and the wait staff is still good but I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"First time here, lunch with a couple of coworkers.  One of my friends and I like to split multiple dishes, so that is what we did.  I am also a sucker for pretzels, so I ordered one for the table to share.  Our server was very pleasant and accommodating to our group.  While the pretzel was cooking, our server brought out the soups and salads that were ordered with our meals.  The side salad that came with my meal had a wonderfully tangy Dijon vinaigrette dressing on top along with a nice selection of lettuce and grape tomatoes.  My coworker loved the chicken tortellini soup he got.  Nexrt was our Bavarian pretzel appetizer.  It was thin (in diameter) and the outside appeared overcooked as it was almost impossible to break pieces off...even though the inside was chewy.  It was a little strange in its consistency.  However, the beer cheese dip that accompanied it was delicious, so much so that i used a spoon to eat the last bit left over after the pretzel was gone!  The two main dishes we shared were the chicken schnitzel and chicken paprikash.  The chicken schnitzel was plump and moist with a mild dill gravy sauce on top that also covered the spätzle.  The chicken paprikash was full of paprika flavor and nicely creamy along with large chunks of chicken and spätzle.  I think i liked both dishes equally and would easily order either one again.  Most people don't know that Donauschwaben's has an \"every day\" restaurant available for lunch and dinner...now we do and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We often go there for lunch, and although I always order the same thing, Wiener schnitzel, I always leave well satisfied. The portions are large, the veal well-prepared. The waitresses are very friendly. The day we were there there were three German beers on tap. The atmosphere is quite Ethnic, with German music playing softly in the background. The only trouble is, they are only open for lunch. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went to this place Friday for the first time. Best to get there early, waiting in line for about twenty minutes. Once you are seated , they take your receipt and you are served quickly."}
{"text":"Oh the German-American Cultural Center.  I've been coming here for years.   If you're German, join & you can get all the benefits of being a member (read cheap beer).   I am just beginning a new adventure as a the singer for a German Band this summer & we rehearse here.  Should be fun!"}
{"text":"If I could give more stars, I would! The food and atmosphere are second to none. My favorite is the \"Schweinshaxe\" or \"Eisbein\", in English it would be \"pig heel\". You have to try it to appreciate it, because Deutsche Kueche just doesn't get any better than this! Good German dining available all year, but the above mentioned specialty is offered only about twice a year, and by special request. One time I put my name on \"the list\" and reserved 2 portions. On the day of my visit, I observed several patrons who failed to reserve theirs, and had to make a different selection. For anyone who wants to have a REAL German food experience, this is IT! - Praises also to the dedicated staff, who are attired in traditional German \"Folklore\" with Dirndels and Lederhosen, a nice touch! Frequent special events include the annual Oktoberfest, a MUST for anyone who ever got to experience the one in Munich, or always wanted to yet couldn't. A big piece of \"Heimat\" can be found here with the Donauschwaben! Many Clubs are available to the public, including Soccer for kids, a variety of Folk-Dance Clubs and German Language education at various levels are available to children and adults! I can recommend this place to anyone with or without German \"roots\"."}
{"text":"I love this place! We went for Beer & Brats night which I think they do about every other month. First I had two frostly glasses of Weissbier from the tap. I now have a new favorite beer! Then for  $5 you get your choice of five different types of brats on a bun. I chose the smoked brat and it was hot and juicy and popped when I bit into it. I love that. Then it's only $1 to pick your choice of sides. I chose the German Potato salad and I smothered by Brat with peppers and onions. Yum! The atmosphere in the bar and warm and cozy but we sat out on the patio overlooking the lake. Everyone is happy and there were a few older people around who had heavy German accents. What a wonderful place. We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"We all went out on 3/21/14, for their fish dinner, and we were very pleased, we got in quickly, and was served quickly.Kids really liked the fish and shrimp. Bring Check or Cash, especially for the bar. Its much easier. Its a very nice place and everyone is very friendly. We sat with a nice couple. You will be sat near people you don't know, but its all in the the fun of it all. I wish they would have given us sour cream for our only warm potato, hopefully it will be hotter the next time.    The Fish: Its still not like Buffalo NY fish fries but its close. I was hoping for beer battered fish.It wasn't, but its really good. Fries are   After dinner we let the kids play on their playground for a little since its a nice night."}
{"text":"I gibe this a rare 5 stars. They deserve more but only goes to 5. Been coming here for fish fries for approximately 4 Years now.  The food is awesome, the people are great, since it's  all volunteer they bring their children with them to help. Can't complain about  anything, these people take away from their family and personal time to come and present this huge lay out. By the way  they have a full bar as well, specializing in German product. We go jjst about every week."}
{"text":"Love me some fish fry! I have been going to the German Club for as long as I can remember (even though I'd proud of my Irish/Italian heritage). Best fish fry around!   Went for the first Friday in Lent to find out that their bar is \"members only\" now. Something to do with the liquor license and being busted, BUT if you ask the hostess lady who seats you to be your best friend, she will get you a beer. :) So ask nicely!   They are as Rodney said, from 4-8pm, I went around 6:30 this evening and there was no wait, however, don't let that fool you. You will most likely have to wait, but it's worth it. You order up front and then they seat you at a big round table. Yes, you sit with strangers, but it's what you make of it. I enjoy, the fish is great. For $10 you know you are guaranteed a good hearty dinner.   Highly recommend the German Club during lent for fish fry!"}
{"text":"Wie geht's?!  This place is great!  My Grandparents were in town so I played hookie from work and came here for lunch.  There were 10 of us and they sat us with no problem at all.  Awesome looking place with huge grounds, a pond and what looks to be a soccer field.  As we sat down she server showed us the beer list (we DO have our priorities ya know!)  They have great German/Bavarian beers.  More bottle selection than draft.  I cannot believe how great the beer prices are here.  2.50 for a Warsteiner Dunkle or Hofbrau draft??!!  If ya went anywhere else it would be twice that.  Yet another reason I like private clubs.  Everyone ordered different stuff...I got the chicken with dill cream, mushroom sauce.  Holy hell was it good and tender.  I tried the schnitzel and it was great also.  For sides we had salads, spatzle and cabbage...all were fresh and great.  Im by no means a cabbage eater but Im diggin the pickled cabbage here.  Food came in average time.  About 2 beers worth...thats how I judge the duration of elapsed time.  Mostly an older crowd, which I also like.  People were super friendly and everyone was giving smiles and interacting with other tables.  Kind of restores my faith in humanity a tad.  You dont get that much in Tremont or most of Cleveland for that matter.  After our food and great beers we strutted around the HUGE compound and checked it out.  They have HUGE banquet rooms and even an INDOOR soccer pitch!  I cant wait to slap on my leather lederhosen and watch the Krauts party down at one of the many festivals they have throughout the year.  Bis später!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite place for fish fry. The food is prepared well the cost is reasonable. The staff is beyond friendly and yet very professional."}
{"text":"The fish fry was good but not worth the wait in line for me. Food is served at large tables so unless you have a party of 10 or 12 you will be dining with others. That is not necessarily bad but our table mates were not up for a conversation. We ate and left."}
{"text":"Went here last night for the fish fry as it came highly recommended to me. First the logistics, this place gets busy. They serve from 4-8pm, we got there at 5pm and the line was long. You wait in line as soon as you walk in to order and pay. Then you take your receipt to a hostess who seats you at a table of 8 with others. You hand your waitress your slip and the process begins.   Meals included bread/butter, decaf coffee and water, which was at the table when you sit down.   I got the baked fish/fried fish combo with coleslaw and a baked potato. My husband got fried fish with fries. Everything was really good. The fries were probably the best. We also got dessert which was an apple crumb square.   Note - you do not get sour cream with your baked potato. It is $1 extra and you have to order it at the beginning.  They had vendors selling stuff in the lobby too like Girl Scout cookies, doll clothes, etc."}
{"text":"This place has a GREAT fish fry.  Definitely one of the best in Northeast Ohio.  It's a seasonal fish fry.  The atmosphere in this place is terrific.  It's a German sports club complete with a bar, indoor bowling alley, indoor soccer field, arcade, outdoor soccer field and a nice lake.  To use these facilities, you must be a member.  Fish fry is Friday night, as usual.  Get there early or you'll be waiting 30 minutes in a line that goes out the door.  They usually serve from 4 - 8 PM.  Once you enter the place, you need to know what you want.  They take your order while you're standing in line (there's always a line!).  Then they seat you at a round table and deliver bread and butter.  We usually walk to the bar to buy a couple pitchers of soda at this point.  Note: You will be seated at the same table with other parties.  After about 15 minutes, your fish dinner will arrive.  Eat and get the hell out so the people in line can get their fish on.  As far as the fish goes, both baked and fried are excellent in taste and texture and are always cooked to perfection.  The fries are top notch.  You also get a small side of cole slaw and maybe some apple sauce.  The potato cakes are the best I've had, but you have to order those on the side.  If you like soccer, there's usually a vicious indoor game in the basement on Friday night that you can watch for free after dinner.  Just keep your head up so you don't get beaned by a 60 mph soccer ball."}
