{"text":"Decent tap list, decent food nothing super outstanding. The service was a little slow and the band was terrible. I'd go back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Came to this location of On Tap after a long day at work.  I was seated immediately, and we got our drinks asap. The food wasn't anything to write home about and our waitress (Miss Brookelynn Estepp) was terrible.  We saw her 2 times the entire time we were there.  We were ending our meal and got our checks.  I paid my $50 tab while my fiancee tipped in cash (how we always prefer to pay at restaurants) I even tipped an extra $2 on my card in addition to his $28 cash.  So in total, we tipped Miss Brookelynne $30!  We leave and get in the car and I see that I have a friend request from our Waitress, Miss Brookelynn. I thought it was odd, so I ignored it.  Not 2 minutes later I see a Facebook post that she tagged me in, I open it to see that this waitress POSTED A PICTURE OF JUST MY SIGNED RECIEPT (signature and FULL name included) the posts says \"We don't tip $2 on a $50 tab (my name)\".  To which in any other circumstance I WOULD AGREE WHOLE-HEARTEDLY, but in this case this was not true I tipped $2 on my card, yes.... but there was a whole $28 in cash sitting there too honey buns.  So yeah, for posting my signature- on the internet as well as my full name to try to put me \"on blast\" I will NEVER again eat here or ANY other ON TAP."}
{"text":"I had a burger and fries and skipped the beverages.  The place was packed for a Sunday night and there was a lot going on.  My wife loved her salad, but I find that the bar  and patio seem to be great but the food just okay.  I will definitely go again to see what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"Work on that dryer station KM, toys were not crisp rather anemic... banana pepper breading clearly fell off in the fryer... good beer and all the stuff from the grill was tasty... slow service"}
{"text":"A very friendly and clean place to take my family to eat. Wide variety on the menu and everything we ordered was delicious! Definitely will come back again!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and will NEVER be attending this on tap ever again. I've never been treated so poorly as a regular who goes here twice a week. Pam the bartender is unbelievably rude every time I go in. Also my biggest problem is someone who comes in every week is all of a sudden told that my partner and I can't split a weekly special. Who tells you you cant split food you are ordering when you do this every time you come in. If this is a legit rule you need to educate all your employees and not just have one enforce the rules. Ridiculous. Manager Ron, also huge thumbs down to you and your management skills."}
{"text":"The new location has destroyed it. The customer service that was provided today was horrendous. We waited 35 minutes for a table even though there were plenty of available tables, then once we were sat we were told it would be another 35 minutes for food. The host was rude and threw our menus on the table. We have been On Tap customers for a while but that ended today. What a way to start Father's Day."}
{"text":"Last time I was in town I skipped On Tap because of the star rating. Tonight I checked it out and I really liked it. The beer list is profuse. The food was better than I expected. The staff was very pleasant. The bar seats were mostly filled - on a Sunday evening. I will return here another time- for sure. I liked the facility too. Easy parking. Nice."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the huge beer selection it would get 1 star. Lots too choose from for sure.   Food on the other hand was not great. Too many fried or burgers. Nothing seemed inspired.   I had potato soup and it was full of large wedges. No thanks.   The fish sandwich was just ok. Too much breading and not enough fish. The fries soggy as all get out and limp. Thinking they were under a heat lamp. Yuck!!!    If I had a beer benefactor I'd go back otherwise no thanks."}
{"text":"I went to on tap for the 4th time this year, Last Time Ever.  The slowest service, nice waitress but she was at the mercy of the kitchen. Same as each previous time.   The menu from 2 weeks earlier, had amazingly good spice dry rub/original on a grilled wing. I only went back for that item. The grill was open, the item was removed from the menu. They would not substitute. The grill was dead! They could have accommodated.   Will never spend another Dime there."}
{"text":"This might help clear up some of the confusion other people seem to have had about On Tap: Think of it as a neighborhood sports bar, y'all.  This is a great local watering hole: clean with a good selection and passable service. If you sit at the bar instead of a table, the service is excellent. They've been great when we showed up with like 9 people and no reservation on a Friday night.... we didn't wait long for a table or our food.  I'm from out of town and always ask to go here when I visit my family members who live five minutes away. We end up here multiple times during my trip and I have never had a non-firstworld complaint.  On Tap has an AWESOME draught selection (like 40+ beers, at least  of which are rotators) and the bartenders really know their stuff. The servers don't know the beer quite as well, but are mostly friendly and prompt. I always try something local that I've never had before and can't get back home, and I have never left disappointed--the worst thing that's ever happened, drink-wise, is that one of my four in a flight was meh. I feel like we watched a game of some sort at the bar the last time I was there, but I think the boys were watching it while we hens chatted.... I don't remember for sure how plentiful or how large the televisions in the bar are.  The food menu is like a novel.... it's about 492 pages and they're super flexible with substitutions. Don't like burgers? Switch it to a chicken patty. Don't like fries? Order mac n' cheese instead. Sometimes there's a nominal charge for a substitution, but if you don't like that.... try being less picky?  This place is super reliable and, while you won't discover an exciting new entree created by a Chopped champion, you WILL find well-prepared basic food that isn't pretentious and is served by someone who smiles politely. And you'll find lots of tasty beer. And I absolutely love that I've never encountered karaoke when I've been in.... that puts it in a small percentage of the sports bars I've experienced.  My best description of On Tap: nothing about it sucks and the beer list goes above and beyond. Next time I'm back in Ohio, I'll be back. :)"}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite spots in town. They had good food and good prices. Once they moved across the street to the new location the food quality went way down, and they seem to have raised their prices. It's a shame."}
{"text":"In the beginning I was excited to enjoy a couple beers and some food . I work in the resturant business so I get the craziness.  I walk in and sit at bar . I get greeted at around a 8 min time frame . Granted it's 3:00. After that I get a beer list . Order a beer and it's another 10 min before I find a person to just get a menu . I order boneless wings they get me bone in . Simple mistake that's fine . But with my boneless it's another 15 min wait for my food . I'm eating wings no napkins.  Prices are high . They charge a extra dollar to toss wings in separate sauce . The will nickel n dime you on that and there drinks ."}
{"text":"I was there last night with a group of people for dinner. I ordered the fried pickles and wings. Both came to the table hot and crispy. Even better than the meal was the young gentleman that waited on us. He was excellent and took great care of us. I appreciated it!"}
{"text":"The place is called 'On Tap', but it should be called 'Off Point'. Quite possibly one of the worst examples of guest service I've seen, which is odd because everyone I've ever met in Ohio is loads of fun.   It all started wrong when host told us we had to get up from table we sat at that was part indoor, part outdoor because we only had 3 in our party and it required party of 5. It was where I desired to sit. The place was about 28% occupied and I promised we'd get at least 5 beers to Jack our Bill up. But no, we had to move to this dusty 4 chair spot against a wall that was filthy.  I wanted to walk out, but to their benefit, I stayed (or apparently not because I'm posting this) and it was only because of their beers on tap.  Our server was mediocre to below average simply because she did not smile from beginning to end. Its the easiest thing to do to make a difference, and she managed to screw it up. She did not want to work today. I checked her service at another table to see if it was just us, but nope, she was just miserable there too.  The food was ordinary. The manager came by and asked how everything was in a prepared routine kind of way and I'm surprised the Hostess didn't tell him about our unhappiness right away. Or maybe she did and he's been hearing so many complaints already (he has to at this place - so unorganized) that he wasn't going to drag anything out that he didn't want deal with.  Meanwhile, no one sat in any of the tables we desired during our stay.   So, Burger ordinary, but burgers really take an effort to mess up. Beer as expected. Service poor, greeting and farewell awful. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Ate here with friends last eve, the place was busy and Hoping. I ordered the fried green beans for an appetizer, and they were delicious! I ordered the SBLT, which was a BLT made with Salmon, and I got fries as a side. My wife had the buffalo chicken salad. The atmosphere was loud, your typical sports bar with TVs everywhere, similar to BW3's. The food arrived in a timely manner, our server was had the free refills made up before you knew you needed another, and was very attentive. All of our group loved their food, and there were no complaints. Our bill for two people was $36+tip, which is about average for two people, I give this place a thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, bigger inside than it looks. I'll definitely be back to try the patio out. It reminds me of a place in Chicago we visited called the Ram, only on a smaller scale. Nice job on the place, looks great"}
{"text":"My second time at On Tap, took some out of town friends and requested a table inside. ..they sat us in the bar with all the doors open.  Asked for a table inside and the Manager said it would be 20 mins.  We sat at the table for 20 mins with drinks.  I went to the manager and requested to be moved.  He said no. Our meals took over 40 minutes. We waited so long no one was hungry.   I will not go back to On Tap and I don't suggest it."}
{"text":"Good place to have a beer and watch TV, but not a good place for a meal.  We had their signature dish, the Gyro.  We added onion rings in lieu of the french fries normally plated.  The gyro was served quickly, by an attentive waitress.  However, that was the end of the good part of the evening.  The gyro meat was bland, and the rest of the sandwich amounted to a huge portion of sour cream.  There were also a few onions.  The pita was dry and hard. Adding the onion rings topped the meal.  They must have been made hours before, as they were like eating cardboard.  Again, flavor was missing, and we left totally disappointed, never to return."}
{"text":"Thought a friend had scheduled a large group .... last minute was told never got the reservation ...."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! I had a turkey sandwich and loaded baked potato soup for lunch this week. The soup was watery and the turkey sandwich was not good. The best thing was the free popcorn. Our server had such an attitude. When we asked for refills, she again had an attitude. It's a shame, the place has so much potential. If they don't get the kitchen and the service fixed, this place won't make it."}
{"text":"Good place for a gyro,burger or wings. Lots of TV's and free popcorn. You get a lot of fries with your order and they always have drink specials . The menu has a great variety so if you have people with varied cravings this place should work."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple other On Tap locations, but it's been a few years.  My visit to this Medina location definitely felt like an upgrade from what I remember - not sure if that's due to the location or time since my last visit.  I found several things on both the food and drink menus that I wanted to try.  The Samhain Pumpkin Ale from Destihl Brewery is one of my new favorites, and I've tried a lot of pumpkin beers.  There was a private party going on in one side of the restaurant, and it looked like a nice space to rent."}
{"text":"It's Huge! Great outdoor bar fun atmosphere. A great addition for Medina! Look forward to my next visit there."}
{"text":"It's been the most frequented establishment during my stay here in Medina , Oh. The have lots of seating and televisions for sports events. The menu has some good burger selections at a reasonable prices. There home made fries are the only thing I don't care for so far. On Mondays they have a wing bar so all you can eat and Monday night football. What goes better with that than a beer. Well the have a large selection of beers on tap and you should have no problem finding one that you like or two or three. For smokers they have an outside area that's enclosed with televisions and radiant heat so it's still comfortable. And if you don't mind the elements they even have a large fire pit for gathering around and enjoying a drink and conversation with friends."}
{"text":"Recently went and ordered the wings. We ordered 50 pack and split flavors.  Wings were just ok except the garlic Parmesan which were awful. We ordered all the wings extra crispy and they were not. the garlic Parmesan wee under cooked, we sent them back and the next bath was the same.  We also ordered the hummus platter and also justvery OK. We did not say anything, just paid and left.  We use to love their food, but have noticed quality does not seem as important as volume.  Server was nice, but she seemed stressed when we asked about the beer menu.  She said it changes every 3 days and she never gets to learn it. I say leave the beer menu alone for awhile and improve quality of food.  They probably will soon be crossed off of our list."}
{"text":"Food is very good. But what I appreciated more than anything was the promptness of their staff, especially the bartenders. They were prompt and courteous, not spending to much time with one customer but surveying the bar and making sure all were cared for. Chelsea was great. Will soon visit this On Tap location again because of this."}
{"text":"Beer was cold and had great selection. Food was mediocre at best, service was good and people friendly. The problem started the next morning on the toilet for two hours. Do not eat here."}
{"text":"Had a really good oops gyro and fries. Service was fast and good. Fun, cool atmosphere with games for kids outside. Free popcorn while you wait, which was not long at all even though the place was packed"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I feel some of the harsher reviews are a bit unnecessarily critical. This is my first time going back to On Tap in years so this is also my first time at their new locations. My first time going to On Tap was about 20 years ago. The new location was very nice. It was a nice open floor plan and it was very spacious inside. The server we had was phenomenal. She was younger server but she came back several times to check on us and made sure that our glasses were never empty. The air-conditioning seemed to be on high which made my wife a little uncomfortable.  Luckily I had a spare sweatshirt out in the car. The food was good, not great, but good. I'll give this place a solid 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"been here a couple times. it's a nicer place than the one in Montrose and nicer than the old Medina location I'd visited as a youth. the first visit was ok but nothing special. went again yesterday with some friends and was unsatisfied with my food. Erin and Luke ordered the Veggie appetizer which was fine but i'd ordered wings. i'd heard the wings were terrific here but mine were tough and tasted old and like they'd been reheated. the sauce was fine but couldn't make the wings tasted good. i'd ordered 5 and managed to choke down 3 of them but couldn't bring myself to eat the others. also, this is a bar and there were kids - very young kids - all over the place. i just don't get that."}
{"text":"First time here and it was a Tuesday night. It was pretty busy as they were having trivia. The service was good and the food was good. I sat outside, very nice outdoor seating and bar area. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is for their new location in the plaza.  Went there the other night.  It's a fun atmosphere.  Would be a good place to watch any sporting event.  There is a good selection of craft beers, which our whole table ordered.  The problem was, our server was not familiar with the beers they had on tap.  The friends I was with drink these beers on a regular basis and know their stuff.  The server brought the wrong drinks twice!  My friend told him it was the wrong beer, but the server said it was not.  He didn't even try to make it right or fix it.  There was absolutely no effort in making sure his customer was happy with his beer choice.  There were a dozen different things he could have done to correct the situation but he did nothing.  The two at the table who got the wrong beer left quite angry.    The food was okay.  Bar food, nothing great.  Again, if we were there for a sporting event or something it would have been fine.  I wouldn't choose it for a dinner night out.  There aren't many other establishments in Medina where this is located so this place is pretty busy."}
{"text":"OMG - if I could leave 0 stars I would. Unfortunately, Yelp doesn't  allow that.  My party of 6 were there tonight, 12/28, and waited. And waited. And waited for service. After 20 minutes I got up and went to the host stand and said that I felt we had been forgotten. Host looked at me like I had 3 eyes and said he'd send someone over. No apology. After 10 more minutes with no service I went back and told the host that we were leaving. No reaction from him and I  went back to our table to go. At that point a server came over and said she'd take our order. No way - we were out of there. I cannot recommend this location - stay away!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 2 star because the view in back and the patio are incredible. It's hard to screw up a fixed structure or opening a bottle of beer. Otherwise if this is the level of food and service the rest of the chain offers then they are in big trouble. As far as I am concerned, the ambiance is the only thing keeping this place open. My wife and I were regulars at the original location in North Hampton (now Cuyahoga Falls). Since we moved to Medina 15 years ago, we tried the old location and it was disappointing. After they moved into the new location we thought we would stop in now and then for a walk down memory lane. So far we have given them four dine-in shots and two carry-out opportunities. All experiences missed the mark at one level or another. The final straw was our last visit. My wife who travels frequently and eats all over the country was adamant that she did not want to torture herself with the unhealthy, greasy food and bad service of our prior visits. I wanted some place fun... She ordered Broccoli Groovers, her all time favorite appetizer from back in the good old days. On her first bite she nearly sprayed her mouthful at me. The broccoli was rancid hidden under the freshly fried breading. Broccoli isn't that pleasant smelling to begin with but when I checked them out I was appalled that someone would actually dip a piece of veggie that nasty into batter and throw it in the fryer for some unsuspecting customer to eat. The couple at the next table even remarked they could smell it but apparently they had food issues of their own. When the waitress finally came around we told her about that, the bottom of my hamburger bun having turned to mush from sitting in the grease that drained off the mountain of fries and the flat draft beers. Instead of concern we were met with indifference. She told us she would check about having the Groovers taken off our tab. I was of a mind that a place with any pride would have been hanging their heads low and offered to comp the meal. The waitress returned with our check...and no deduction for the spoiled food. After waiting for her to come back, I chased her down. She called a manager who explained how all of the appetizers were hand crafted and could not imagine how this happened. I begrudgingly got the credit. This place has the feel of a restaurant with ownership that knows nothing of the restaurant business but wants a big return to pay for all of the investment in ambiance. The management appears to have been farmed out to people who lack the skill set to manage a kitchen and concern themselves only with keeping the bottom line going. The apathy the employees feel most likely is a top down thing."}
{"text":"Food is decent and the staff is attentive. The patio in the summer will keep you coming back!"}
{"text":"My family has been to the new location 2-3 few times. Kitchen is often very slow, even on slow days, and wait staff is always apologizing for it. Burgers are most always overcooked. Front-end staff is always superb and accommodating. They do have the awesome Pumpkin Spice Cider which is very hard to find!   The things they do well are onion rings and sauerkraut balls. Wings are still pretty good too, and the buffalo dip is great when they don't run out of it. Gyros are always skimping on the meat. Fries are cheap. My friends run restaurants and catering companies, and potatoes are cheap, so they still get these right thank goodness.  Biggest thing missing, though, is breakfast - BRING BACK THE BREAKFAST. They had it at the old location down the street. Vegas-style breakfasts were the norm and we made it there every chance we could to have mini-work meetings. Kids were free on Sundays, and my two 4yr old boys each got a pancake each and applesauce. I guess pancakes started rising in price because soon THAT ended (no matter we met our family members without kids) and those free pancakes started costing $1.50. Nevermind their drinks were already costing $2.00 each! Still, the breakfast was great, but it's still on the *NEW* menu?   I hope they read these reviews, because they're what real people are telling you about your business. Quality + Quantity = more people coming and more business income. I hope they aren't losing sight of the customer, but it seems they are. it might be turning into a bar anyway and less a family place."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere with a nice bar and ample selections of beer ,wines and food. Enjoyed the nice service and everyone was very friendly. Would definately come back. Will most definitely reommend this place . Thx DR MD"}
{"text":"What is everyone complaining about?  Same food as old place--excellent wings, good burgers, great fries.  And a beer selection to die for.  Service was fine on a busy Sunday evening.  Very good value for the money."}
{"text":"Wife and I had a mediocre meal of gyros here once, they were also out of the buffalo chicken dip at about 6:00.  We decided to give the establishment another chance, and went again tonight. We both ordered burgers, medium and medium rare. Burgers tasted like frozen burgers, both cooked well. Told my server (who was awful) and his response was \"yeah the kitchen does that sometimes,\" and walks away. Additionally the shells and cheese were so dried out that it had literally hardened into a single mass.  We will never return here again. There are plenty of options in area like Rocknes and Alexandria's, don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"I love their creeper and garlic wings..It is the best around here. They got specials everyday. $50c wings on thursdays and you get a free popcorn before you order... Awesome. I love this place. They have a nice outside setting too."}
{"text":"I don't see nothin wrong.. Great beers, music, and service. Clean.. Didn't eat but looked good. Would def come back!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and food.  Duck wings with siracha bourbon sauce is the BEST!!!"}
{"text":"Nice clean sports bar/Resturant atmosphere with decent bar food. The place is kind of sectioned off with a dinning area to the left. Bar area to the right and a middle dinning room then some sort of indoor/outdoor patio toward the back. It is a nice upgrade from BW's and I plan on trying it again. We could have just ran into some bad luck getting a seat in the dinning area that was basically empty and the older lady at the door was a bit grumpy. Overall good, I had a few wings tossed in creeper sauce and they had some kick. The kids loved having popcorn while we waited to order."}
{"text":"Gyros are good and their Mahi Mahi kabobs were excellent. It's a bar atmosphere and they have a really big outdoor patio.  On Tap has always been known for their sauerkraut balls and homemade poppers, don't leave without trying them."}
{"text":"This is our favorite bar to go to! Food is delicious and they have a large selection of beers. Great open concept so you can see the TV's no matter where you sit at. Restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly!"}
{"text":"Food was just OK, nothing special. Waiter didn t know drinks, didn t seem to care. My Margarita was lousy, watered down. Will not be back."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Half our order was incorrect. Waitress seemed confused when we brought It to her attention and tried to blame it on the cooks not reading the ticket correctly, it was the wrong sandwich and we were also missing an additional side. Took quite a while to get her attention for both refills and the bill. Took a long time for the correct sandwich to get brought out, but They did remove it from the bill at least."}
{"text":"Good place to get drinks. It's a local sports bar with a good draft selection. The food is decent. The buffalo dip is awesome."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and great atmosphere inside and out.   Small Greek salad was big and fresh.  Wish I could say same for Tap burger...was overdone but grilled onions on it were tasty.  Large portion of fresh cut potato fries.  I liked the fresh popcorn to go with my beer and bar atmosphere. Patio was full tonight also."}
{"text":"Back for another try.  Well the burger of choice was Scotty Burger.  Cheddar, Scotch Whiskey BBQ, Something like fried onions, on a interesting looking bun with large hole in top half.  The bun was not normal bun, nor pretzel, nor of any recognizable breed.  The fries were a little past done.  And the place was dead on Saturday at 12:30pm.  Mom stuck with an On Tap Burger (grilled onions and mushrooms).  She was not impressed and she like the place.  Again fries were left in just a bit too long.    OK positives..They have good sweet tea, and give you free popcorn!  The service was good but deliberate in pace.  Rating should be 21/2 stars, but that's what my reviews average."}
{"text":"This place has the best wings I've ever had. They were my favorite in the old building and remain my favorite wing today."}
{"text":"We went to On Tap Medina for dinner and drinks...the food was mediocre at best, the wings were tiny and the sauce was super tart...my cousin ordered the veggie burger and he said that the Burger King veggie burger was better, Burger King!...But the worst part of our visit to On Tap Medina was the drinks, we had 6 patron shots each and a few beers, and we didn't feel anything, I suspect they are watering down their alcohol or switching it out for the cheap stuff...Don't go here if you want have a good time, you will be disappointed as I was..."}
{"text":"This used to be a favorite stop for a nice meal - but no more.  The food quality has really gone downhill. Too bad. Last night I ordered a Greek salad with grilled chicken and pub chips to go.  How disappointing when I got home an saw the cold dry chickens that was on my salad. It looked like it was a previously frozen \"grilled\" piece of meat.  I ordered my meal online and also didn't receive the pub chips - when I called about it I was told they don't offer them anymore.  I asked for my money back and was told it wasn't an option. Again disappointing- time to try a new casual dining option."}
{"text":"When you ask how a customer how they want their burger cooked you should have an idea how to cook to order. Medium does not mean hockey puck well done.   I would come back for the beer selection and perhaps appetizers, but not for lunch or dinner. We may be back to try breakfast and hope it's better."}
{"text":"We ate here again yesterday late afternoon and it was just strange. Our waitress really couldn't describe the daily special and when my wife inquired about the different soups (which our waitress didn't know what they were and had to ask another employee)she stated that they can taste different from day to day because different cooks make them different ways! Huh? She seemed like a nice person but just didn't know a lot about the food being served. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with tomato and lettuce with fries but the fries were really dark and seem like they had absorbed a lot of grease. My wife ordered the salmon BLT with soup as a side choice but after waiting for a while we had to ask the waitress to bring the soup out before the meal (that's normal right?)The chicken sandwich was good and the salmon BLT was very tasty but it just seemed like a lot of effort on our part just to get a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Very nice place lots of space good customer service great appetizers and food and drinks plus you get free popcorn for your table stopped in on a Sunday I would have to come back for a Friday or Saturday to see what the atmosphere is like"}
{"text":"This is a clean restaurant. There is lots of beer to chose from but it's expensive for the area. I prefer the portage lakes location - well because it has a water view. Some patrons there had obviously had a little too much to drink and were quite loud. Food is ok. Wings are best item on menu. We got a sampler and wings. The fried pickles were breaded very poorly and yet still tasty."}
{"text":"Place is nice. One thing that would make it better is not to burn popcorn. That smell lingers too long and then I want to leave sooner."}
{"text":"I liked the olde location better it had a more  cozy feel . This place is just very generic atmosphere.  And who doesn't have Franks Red Hot."}
{"text":"I really want to like it. I'm fairly certain I've been to every On Tap location. This one is the nicest, which is a bonus because the old location had to be the smallest! The downside to that is that they are often jam packed. And since they are busy, they often make mistakes. Like, 9 times out of 10 something gets messed up or the service is slow. Maybe they're understaffed? I don't know, but they've been open here long enough to have corrected such an issue. So, 4 stars for food, 1 for service, therefore 2 stars overall.  I still like the food so we keep going back, but I know what to expect - something wrong and slow service. (Note, the service at the actual bar is better, IMHO)  We've also had carry out multiple times and I kid you not, every single order was missing something. I do not leave the parking lot without verifying my entire order is there. Nothing like getting home and finding out your kid's meal is only half there, and then they cry...it's not pretty.  So, now you know. Food is good, just prepare yourself. And if you order carry out, check that order before you even walk away from the hostess stand."}
{"text":"This was a great little stop for lunch on the way home from Medina. The server was knowledgeable and vet helpful. Great service and good food! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We went the weekday they have the 'make your own pasta' bar, and I was pleasantly surprised!  Yes, the choices are few - three pastas (shells, linguine and whole wheat spaghetti) and three sauces (red, pesto and Alfredo) - but I was still able to make quite the masterpiece!  Shrimp as one of the protein choices.  Around $10, including a beer!"}
{"text":"Been here multiple times. The service we had tonight was great with our waitress Lauren. One thing, I keep coming back and always disappointed about the food. I ordered the buffalo melt and the sandwich was way smaller than I thought it would be. It looks like they made up for the small sandwich with a ton of fries. I was still hungry so I ordered a bowl of vanilla ice cream and it was almost $3 for it lol I think I finally made up my mind I will not go for a meal but only a snack."}
{"text":"At the New (location) On Tap Grill and they are out of food.  Ran out of food on Fathers Day....really.  Place looks great but poor management.  Hope my next visit is better than this.  No excuse!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here was great! They had a daily beer menu to select from and huge selection of food to choose from. The staff was very kind and friendly  our waiter came up every 5 to 10 minutes to check to see how we were doing and refil our beverages. Food was typical bar food/pub food but good overall. Definitely recommend anyone stopping by through Medina."}
{"text":"This was a good place to go and meet before they moved. Yes the building is better, but the food is not the same and very expensive.  Had a business meeting there and ordered the broccoli appetizer for 5.99 it came out with 7 pieces of fried broccoli, cost almost as much as the wings.  Guess they need to pay the higher rent."}
{"text":"The food is cheap, my wings still had feathers, service is not good at all. They gave my friend the wrong wings and they took them back and washed them off, refried them and covered them in pepper and spices. My other friend ordered fried pickles and they came soggy. My girlfriends grilled cheese was not melted. The manager came over and said everything fine? And left quickly. The real kicker is I told them how bad the food was and they had to find out for themselves. But MY food was good that night. I do like their firehouse sauce but one sauce can only do so much for an establishment. Especially an establishment that nickels and dimes buying cheap food and doesn't look at the dollars they could be making by offering higher quality. Buffalo Wild Wings is right across the street and has better wings and service and sports."}
{"text":"We stopped by here on our way home from a day trip.  When we got there the outside isn't much to look at, but the inside is pretty nice! We decided to order the large appetizer and was overwhelmed when it arrived. The picture made it look like it was a large dinner plate size, but what they sat in front of us was the size of a fricken hula hoop!!  And we had ordered sandwiches too!!!  I got the \"Pork Chop\" soup, and it was amazing, sounds weird but it is well worth the weirdness of the sound.  I would recommend going to this place all the time! Maybe even everyday! :)"}
{"text":"As On Tap gets more popular their quality gets worse. The food is not too bad but I never thought it was amazing. The service is not great either. I would recommend going to Bistro 111 or Master Pizza just down the block."}
{"text":"Came in after an akron rubberducks game and paw patrol road tour.  Famished and dehydrated. Coors light 22 Oz on special, icy  cold-blooded delicious!  Ordered tuna melt, buffalo chicken panini, chicken tenders and homemade Sauerkraut balls.   Note to sauerkraut ball aficionados: these were not homemade.  Uniform and deep fried, also pretty spicy, not traditional.  Buffalo chicken sandwich tasted rancid- could not eat it, fries on the side were soggy and inedible.  Tuna melt was edible but a sad gray slop on a flatbread, I felt sorry for it but happy it filled me up.  A side dish of mac and cheese was a plop of starchy noodles, orange colored and remnants of a sauce long dried up.  Will not be back unless if I'm only out for drinks!"}
{"text":"Meh... I ordered a Gyro...Came out in a timely fashion and pretty big too which is a plus... Problem? Dry as crap!!!! I should'a  asked for extra tzatziki sauce but didn't think about it until it was half gone but I just threw it down...Enjoyed the fries tho and topped off with a couple of Stella's... It wasn't so bad but meat was dry and I got about 5 cubes of tomato which made for a lackluster sammich.... Try again soon and will update... Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is the second Saturday night in a row I have not had a good experience at On a Tap. A waitress came up to me very rude, must have been a Medina High School student or graduate! I would love to have taken her on but my husband wouldn't let me. And the bands suck!! Have no idea how to pick talent!"}
{"text":"Isn't it a health code violation to store personal water bottles in the same ice you make drinks with? Gross gross gross"}
{"text":"Terrible food, like, really really bad. Soggy fries, tasteless burgers, over seasoned and greasy chicken... You get the picture.  Service was mediocre at best, generally lousy. The server didn't even come to take our drink order for 15 minutes. She showed up right before we got up and left. The food took forever and I couldn't even get a refill on water. I absolutely do not recommend this place at all. If I could give it negative stars I would!"}
{"text":"The new building is clean and easier to get too. Great service and good wings."}
{"text":"What a great time we had here! Food was good and service was awesome! Erin was so friendly and made it so much fun!! We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"The only good thing I've eaten here are their French fries. It's a nice bar/restaurant get somebody to help with the food!"}
{"text":"This place reminded me of a pub back where I live in Northwest Indiana aka or the region. Any way the food is great and staff was wonderful. Especially loved live entertainment and outdoor games. Great job continue with the great work. I'll be coming back there when I have a chance. Thank you staff and management for making me feel at home with your establishment."}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant that I use all the time for business meetings. It's great for lunch. It's very clean, the servers are very nice, and the food is what I would consider better than normal barfood. I will keep coming back to this location as long as everything stays the same. They also have a very nice outdoor patio with corn hole and a DJ at night."}
{"text":"Save your money!  I read all the reviews online, yet I still have it a chance.  They inspired me to go to BW3 less than a half mile away. Trust I would have walked it with a broken leg.       Absolutely gorgeous building, and has potential to be great!  Bartenders seemed angry and I was bothering them even though I was 1 of 5 people at the bar.  Two bartenders I might add!!!  The food was worse than the service!  Management wasn't seen my 1/2 hour I will never get back.      I am a bartender in a busy place and I am extremely lenient on the service industry because people expect too much.  Not the case here.  I watched a 2 count for my margherita!?  Wha!!  Do not take the chance travelers, spend the money you have saved for your vacation or the allowance your company gives you somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have been here several times, with good food and service. Yesterday, my wife and I met friends there for lunch. We arrived and were promptly set up with a table for eight. Our waitress was very friendly and got our drinks. Our appetizer (fried pickles) were good. Our Oopa Gyro was average at best. The sweet potato fries were cold. My wife's fish tacos were ordered blackened, because we both like spices food. They were not edible. It was a mouthful of seasoning only. You tasted no other flavor at all. When brought to the attention of our waitress, her attitude was pretty much one of disinterest and she told us we ordered it spicy and that's what we got. We said something a couple times and were pretty much blown off. Not wanting to make a scene and ruin lunch, we left it go. Next time we meet this group, we'll drive ten minutes to Montrose. Better selection. Better food. I suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"Use to eat at their old location all the time food was great. The new location is absolutely horrible this was our 5th visit and 5th bad experience.  Every time we go there are 8 of us and no one has had a good meal yet. Very disappointing place use to be great i guess bigger isn't always better."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here has been excellent. I highly recommend the wings-the original sauce is my personal favorite. Also loved the garlic butter wings with a side of original. Get the wing platter to share! The buffalo chicken salad is great & comes with pita bread. Extensive beer menu including local and seasonal favorites. Patio is a hit in the summer and there is plenty of seating at the multiple bars here. They accommodate groups well as we often go after soccer games. The free popcorn is a perk."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers and wide selection of food. Great service and fun atomosphere. Id come back for a beer and the mushroom appetizer."}
{"text":"Place sucks. Came here for a quick dinner. They screwed up boneless buffalo wings. Didn't think it was possible but they did it. Slow service. Waiter was clueless"}
{"text":"Food is good, I like their buffalo sandwich. We went for lunch and sat on the patio, my three stars comes from asking the server to cut the volume on the radio just a little since most people (us included) are there for meeting and conversing. She said the manager responded they would do it and it never happened. Tell me no if it's not going to happen and we can move, however I left a little disappointed in that.   Three stars for sure because the patio is laid out well, things to do and comfortable. The service was quick and the food is well prepared.   Will definitely be back but would not go there for lunch meetings."}
{"text":"This place was not what I thought. I thought I was just another bar every time I drove past. So I decided to check it out and man this place is awesome! It kind of reminds me of yard house. The place was packed but the wait was worth it. They had a wide variety of food and drinks. Everything on the menu looked and sounded delicious. The wings and beer were awesome and the prices were great. Definitely recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Came in with my parents and boyfriend for a late lunch. It was during the happy hour and we ordered 3 beers and my dad's and boyfriend's beer was $2.50 but some how mine was $5.50 and when I asked why it's because they only offer their \"happy hour\" for domestic beers. Then they charged for their sides like onion rings and you only get 3 onion rings with your meal.. overly priced food and beer. Only good thing about this was that our waiter was very pleasant and even took off the charges for the sides but when you come in, beware that their happy hour isn't for everything..."}
{"text":"On tap is a hit or miss establishment.  You either hit a period where you can't get a seat or parking spot even if you parked a half mile away, or you find the open period in between the dinner rushes.  5:10 is that beautiful period. Hit or miss also extends to their dishes.  The hickory chicken panini? It was a hit. The chicken was cooked just right and the sauce wasn't over applied and not under applied. The loaded fries? A miss. Everything fried today was floppy, without a crunch.   We decided to eat outdoors today, it was beautiful weather and their well maintained porch area is worth that extra star. The only drawback was the smoking on the patio, it is a crowded area and the smoking really takes away from the meal.   The quick staff was also a plus."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop and have a drink or dinner with your kids. We stopped in for the former on a recent Saturday night. The bartenders were friendly and the beer was on tap and delicious.  We watched NFL playoff football on the big screen TV, which was nice. I didn't try any of their food, but the place was packed and everyone was eating. I will definitely be back for food as this is located very close to home.  There were lots of families with children dining in and I suspect that we will do the same."}
{"text":"We use to love On Tap before they moved but we just had the worse experience at their new location. The waitress was very rude and sarcastic. We waited at least an hour for our food. I ordered a side salad with my meal instead of one of the side offered for an extra charge. The side salad did not come out until all the other food came out so I was annoyed to begin with. Then I noticed a hair in my salad after a couple of bites so I hoped she would come back out so I could get another side as my meal came with two sides. She never came back during the meal and waited for her to come at least another 20 minutes after we finished eating. When she finally did we asked her to take the up charge off my meal since my salad had a hair in it and I only took two bites of it. No apologies just took check back and took the up charge off. Waited another 10 minutes for her to come back for my card. Now on tap of this beverages are not listed on the menu and charge you for every refill on lemonade without telling you until you look at bill. Finally the BLT ARE HORRIBLE. They should be called LT because there was maybe 4 small pieces on a double decker sandwich. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I went to watch the Indians play at the bar in the back- my service was more disappointing than the game. My bartender ignored me and the other customers at the bar. She was on her phone or talking to other employees. It took me 15 minutes to get her attention to tell her there was a piece of hair in my food. She rolled her eyes and took it half way to the back where I watched her physically take the hair out and bring the same plate of food back to me. I was disgusted and asked for my check. 10 minutes later she dropped my check off . Name on the check was Brianna D. I did not see any managers walking around willing to help either . I won't be back."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food left much to be desired. The chicken on my quesadilla looked gray and huge pieces of pepper? No flavor. Lettuce and tomato on the side looked old and they served it to me with gyro sauce. Hubbys gyro was ok. Pita barely Cooke/warm. My kids chicken fingers where pale and not cooked long enough. Beer and drinks were good. No reason to go back."}
{"text":"This is an okay place in medina to go have beers with friends in the summer. They have a good beer selection and a nice patio. Their food; however, looks and tastes like cafeteria food and is served on very cheap plastic plates. It is colorless, sad, and lacking any effort. It would suffice after a few beers but it's a horrible place to go if you're looking forward to having a nice lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"The service was fine and the food was not that good.  I got the cheese steak.....the description should have been called burnt steak-um with cheese.  Usually when you get a steak sandwich there is some steak mixed in, not here.  My wife got the turkey wrap and she wanted mayonnaise instead of ranch.  She was told that she would have to add it herself because the condiment was as on the table.  I am glad that we did not have to wait to be seated or I would have been really pissed."}
{"text":"Just tried the new location, thought we we would wait until the newness wore off. Very disappointing. The service was terrible. We were there on a Saturday for lunch. While there is more than enough staff on hand, looking very busy (talking to each other). What happened to you great seasoned staff? Most looked barely old enough to serve alcohol. It was impossible to get service. Our appetizer platter was delivered, no plates or silverware and we sat 8 minutes trying to get one of the young servers that walked past us to get there attention. Too busy talking openly  about a customer that was upset, unprofessional. I had to ask for a glass for my beer three times. Like the new location, food was good (not hot), but service is more important. I would have asked for a manage, but the only person that looked over 18, was seating guests. If she is a Manager, should pay more attention. Several customers were commenting on how the new On Tap missing it's old appeal. Have bee long time loyalty, don't want to go anywhere else... will try again soon and let you know."}
{"text":"Food bad service bad. Not coming back. Soup potatoe was not hot and tasted like it was sitting. Burger was cold along with fries. Service was poor. Told waitress soup was not good and she said they had a lot of complaints today oh well."}
{"text":"Had an awesome time food was great they have entertainment some nights inside in the winter and out side in the summer. Fun place for the family the new place looks really good and the staff cannot do enough for you. I am a local DJ and I will be working there in the new year so look out for even better time !! Starlight Entertainment."}
{"text":"Staff really hustled. Great sense of humor.  Got us a table for 7.  Live band was ok.    I got to try some different craft beers.   My blackened shrimp salad was pretty awesome.  Hubby ordered mac and cheese, but he got potato soup instead.  The fries are touted to be the best ever.   (After a few beers, they really are.)   You can order stuff to take away. Free popcorn. Lots of outdoor games to play.  Giant Jenga, corn hole, etc. Clean bathroom.   Lots of big screens inside for sports.  Something for everyone."}
