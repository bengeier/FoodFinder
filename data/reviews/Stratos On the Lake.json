{"text":"This place was pretty good, we went out to eat here with some friends and no complaints about the food.  The service was great.  Remember that Customer appreciation dayis the last thursday of each month...half off your meal with purchase of a drink."}
{"text":"We stopped there when we were looking for a different restaurant actually we couldn't find anymore (we didn't remember the name). Anyways, we passed by and I read the one review on yelp so we decided to stop.

We got there and the place was pretty much empty. The inside is very dated and could have been a little cleaner and better maintained. I almost wanted to leave right then.

Service was good. Quick and very friendly. The food was cheap and not great. I had the pork chop special which came with salad and soup bar(all you can eat). The pork chops had a nice flavor, but were a bit dry. They put way too much butter on the mashed potatoes. So much in fact that I couldn't eat them at all. It just doesn't look very appetizing if you have puddles of melted butter all over the plate. We'll probably not be going back there."}
{"text":"My Wife and I were visiting family and friends in the area and we went on the recommendation of a friend. This was Sunday Sept. 25th and the first thing when we went is was it was about 90 degrees in the place! I would have left but others said we would tough it out. Service was good but I had what was supposed to be Lake Erie Perch and if it was they were giant perch! It was OK but I don't think it was L.E. Perch. My Wife had liver and onions and said it was just fair. Price was OK but I would have paid much more for some A/C and better food. We will not return."}
