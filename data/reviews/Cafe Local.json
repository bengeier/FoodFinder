{"text":"We use to come here often for burgers and good confort food. On a sunny Sunday morning came for brunch with my son. Sat at the half empty terrace and waited 45 minutes for our simple order of eggs and sausage and crepes. When they finally came, potatoes were cold and eggs whites poorly cooked.  The lame excuse : \"we have too many clients.\" I wonder how will they handle it in summer."}
{"text":"I go to Cafe Local all the time, but summer only when the terrace is open. The place has a great atmosphere, people are cool, and the food is good.  Now sitting inside OR having breakfast is another story. The breakfast sucks - tiny portions, poorly cooked, and often cold. To add insult, they charge you $2.00 for a side order of a slice of toast. I understand there's a markup in restaurants, but I could buy the whole damned loaf for that. Would it have killed them to throw in another slice of toast for an $8.95 2-egg standard plate? Things like that are the reason the place is deserted in the first half of the day."}
{"text":"My sister lives in Montreal, so I make the trip from NYC to see her a few times a year.   We've been to Cafe Local for dinner and drinks on at least two prior occasions, and enjoyed both, but my most recent trip prompted me to write a review. Coming from NYC and being something of a burger fanatic, I like to think I know good restaurant food -- burgers, fries, salads. Having been raised in Canada, I like to think I know good poutine. Hell yes, I do.  Cafe Local satisfied my NYC craving for top-notch restaurant cuisine, while fulfilling my Canadian itch for poutine that only a trip north can deliver. We shared a tasty salad, my burger was awesome, and poutine (comes in a huge bucket, we got ours with sweet potato fries) was out of this world. To top it off, the service was truly charming and a nice wine list as well.  This place is a gem. Look forward to being back there again on my next northern quest."}
{"text":"\"Let me say before I go any further that I forgive nobody. I wish them all an atrocious life and then the fires and ice of hell and in the execrable generations to come an honoured name.\"  it was a rain soaked  and windy summer's evening and my thinning hair needed refuge from the elements,so i made my way to the closest eatery to distract myself from the forlorn rags of growing old.    the restaurant lives up to its name, it's indeed local, but on this particular evening i wished they set up shop in the middle of the sahara desert.   i took my seat, as i often do, alone in the corner, with a view of two other occupied tables before me, it was close to closing time. after much deliberation, i decided to go with the chef's special written on the small chalkboard, which was some sort of fish atop a bed of risotto with your choice of house salad or the soup du jour, ginger carrot soup.   the soup tasted like it was of the canned or condensed variety, just a watery pool of orange, pepper was the only way to find some relief. the fish was overcooked and dry, service and  space was nice, but can't make up for what they were serving.   of course, one must contemplate the merits of ordering fish on a menu dominated by sandwiches, but i'm of the belief that if it's on the menu, if it's coming out of that kitchen and given a price tag, it should be good, especially if it's a featured daily item.    the patio might lure my indoor complexion away from these walls for a pint in the summer, but as for now, if i saw it in the middle of the sahara desert, i'd say no thanks, i'll take my chances."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times for the sweet potato poutine. A must try for any tourist or vegetarian looking for this delicious local delicacy.   Portion is more than enough for one person.  The gravy is mushroom based and the poutine is perfectly spiced.    The only thing that would make this poutine better would be a combination of half regular fries and half sweet potatoes.  The sweetness of the potatoes sometimes is too overwhelming. However if you're into sweet potatoes, this is the only place in the city that makes it with them."}
{"text":"Nice spot in the Mile End to sit by the fire and have a drink. Clean, nice wooden details, leather couch, spacious but warm and cozy and well-lit, and for all that alone I'd start at 3 stars, no sweat. My guy friends enjoy the pulled pork sandwich here - it's got big hefty chunks of pork and a tasty sauce. For me, it tastes a little too much of the pork fat and the bun is a little heavy, but the man loves it. The fourth star goes to the staff who I find charming - recently there for lunch I was impressed by friendly touches, especially when we sat there for a while after having paid the bill and still had out waters refilled, and no sense of rush in the world."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely terrible. We ordered yam fries and the yam was RAW. Salad is stale and burger is way too salty. Not just their kitchen doesn't know how to cook,  they also have no fresh ingredient. Will never come back."}
{"text":"In the trendy jewish area of mile end, this place isn't so bad. when the terrace is open, it's even better.  I ate brunch/lunch here and while the menu was small, everything looked good. i especially thought the tuna tartare was nice. The portions on the poutine are great, and it's nice they have a sweet potato version. My friends say this place is great for drinks at night in this part of montreal.   But at the end of the day, it's nothing special. it's just another nice place in mile end."}
{"text":"Ce petit resto est situé près du travail et est le lieu de plusieurs dîners entre collègues.    Le menu est varié et satisfait tous les genres d'appétits. Le service est relativement rapide lors du dîner donc n'hésitez pas à y aller entre collègues!  L'atmosphère y est très décontractée quoique le décor aurait peut-être besoin d'un petit renouveau. Le personnel prend le temps de bien expliquer le menu et répond à toutes vos questions de façon très courtoise.  Selon moi, les plats à surveiller lors du dîner sont la salade locale ( à essayer avec poulet ou saumon !), le Mac & Cheese jalapeño (absolument décadent !)  et la poutine au rôti de porc barbecue émincé ( à se rouler par terre !). Les hamburgers sont aussi excellents mais malheureusement, il faut habituellement ajouter les frites en supplément.  Je compte bien y retourner encore, car c'est devenu un classique pour les collègues du coin!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for warm coloured walls, crown moldings and rustic, wood furniture. So when a restaurant has all those things ticked, I'd let myself be lured in, even if the menu wasn't out of this world inspiring (sometimes you just want something simple anyway, right?). And that's exactly what happened recently when me and three friends walked around the Mile End looking for a place to have dinner, and chanced upon Cafe Local.  The food was pretty good (I had a grilled chicken burger and the toppings were nice), but it was the service that truly melted me. Our waitress was very friendly, explained the menu well and basically took very good care of us. We lingered for quite a long time after we ate our dinner - we even played bananagrams -  but we didn't feel like they were trying to sweep us out of there.   I probably won't go back there too quickly to have another dinner, but if I'm looking for a place to hang out and have hot chocolate or drinks or something, it would definitely be in my top three picks!"}
