{"text":"First I am extremely happy there is actually a sit down pizzeria close by aside from P-Hut.  When you walk in the door, on the left is the counter for pick-up/take out orders.  On the right, is the entrance to the dinning room.  Looks like they are getting this set up.  Great mural on the wall, but the tables and chairs are standard.  So no booths.  On to the food.  So I have been here multiple times now, so that must say something.  First, love the Lasagna.  But, I have had it 3 times and every time I need to ask that it be heated more.  It is homemade (and awesome), but obviously they don't keep it sitting around hot.  But they do for some reason wait until the last minute to heat it up.  Hot on the outside, cool on the inside.  So I recommend it, but tell the to really heat it up.  Pizza and Stromboli are great.  Now I am a carnivore but there vegi ranch pizza is crazy good.  Their service is fantastic.  They also deliver."}
{"text":"When you see the Italian colors & a beautiful outdoor patio, you know you can't lose with great food & cold bottled beer.....  Italiano's Pizzaria is in Mantua, a rolling & beautiful suburb that's southeast of Cleveland, Ohio.  Mantua is located in a more rural area on RT 44 just north of I-80 and south of RT 422.  Italiano's has parking around the building.  It's a quiet, casual dining experience, typical of a small pizzaria & great for any type of crowd.  There was no waiting time.  The serving sizes were huge!  However, we were mixed on the food with a few suggestions.  Rigatoni (penne) homemade pasta dinner and Kamden's Rigatoni (penne) with Meatball & Kids' Juice Box were great with a fabulous original sauciness & positives on flavor.  The side of house-made meatballs were good but could use a bit more flavor flare to really hit.  Served with fresh made bread & butter that was completely amazing.  Italiano 1/2 Pound Burger with Capicola, Ham, Salami, Lettuce, Tomato, & Creamy Italian Dressing had potential, but it was a bit well-done, partially my fault for not mentioning how I prefer burgers cooked.  As a suggestion, I would prefer the meat only slightly cooked and not full-out fried.  The fried deli meats reminded me of childhood \"fried bologna\" .....lol.....  Note to self, when dining at an Italian restaurant, go for what they specialize or ask for what they're famous?  Trevor was an exceptional server.  The pizzaria's staff were all friendly.  Food prep was about thirty (30) minutes.  The food was professionally plated with generous pasta & equally generous sauce portions in what literally seemed to be never-ending bowls.  I would definitely choose Italiano's over any Italian chain, because the value was unbeatable.  Our family of four (4) ate, had plenty of leftovers, plus left a legit tip for Trevor, and all for less than $50.  I'd love to jump around their menu, because they had so much to offer!"}
