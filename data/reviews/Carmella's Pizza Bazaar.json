{"text":"I grew up in Solon, Ohio more years ago then I care to admit to, but it was still a small town then, and I and other old schoolers have fond memories of the excellent pizza at Carlo's Pizza Bazaar. Little did I know that it was affiliated with Carmella's, and I'm thrilled with the discovery!!  This pizza is outstanding.... The longer wait (45 minutes,)  ensures that this is a hand-crafted masterpiece. The crust is perfect, every time, the sauce has the perfect tang, and I'm drooling thinking about the sausage they use; spicy and aromatic REAL Italian sausage!! Well worth the drive from wherever you're coming! Mass produced pizza?? Fuggedaboutit!!! Carmella's is my go-to pizzeria."}
{"text":"~~~Ben's Crazy Reviews~~~ (read em here)  Wow! Where to start?   My good friend Jacob and I browsing all of Yelp for pizza (yum!). Let's just say we were your basic hungry young boys. Ya know the ones that are 23 and neeeeeed that cheese sauce and bread fix (pizza)? Okay. So we call and order two pizzas, medium. Wait our 30 minutes and then drive on this cold December night to get that zah (pizza). To say we were excited would be actually quite accurate. First thing's first. Interior and personnel were welcoming, fresh, and clean. Smiles and money exchanged; we were on our way.  TASTE TIME!!: Not bad. Ratio of bread/sauce/cheese is 10/5/8, which would be a good stat line for an NBA bench player. I liked the pizza but I can't tell if it was because I was young hungry boy or if it was actually good pizza. I'll guess the latter cause why not!!? 4/5 thank you!   PS it would be important to note that I broke a glass at my home after getting back with the pizza. It wasn't directly the pizza's fault but indirectly?? You be the judge hahahaha  -Ben"}
{"text":"Quality ingredients. This pizza never disappoints.  Take out only and cash only place.  But for taste - Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"This pizza is excellent. Growing up, we would drive from Bedford to Euclid just for a pizza from Carmella's Pizza Bazaar. It was always worth the drive and we would be happy the whole way home knowing we were going to have a great dinner.   This place has been around for a while and has a nice family feel to it. The fact that it has been in business for so long speaks to how good it is. I highly recommend everyone try the pizza ( I like the pepper and onion myself!) - it is well worth it AND reasonably priced!!"}
{"text":"It's greasy and delicious, with what almost taste like a butter fried crust. Sadly, this little mom-and-pop shop remains all but unfindable; with its obscure side street entrance, cluttered front window and a sign that is hidden behind an over-grown tree. In my two years living a mile away, I had never heard of Carmella's. As a strictly takeout operation, this nestled gem in the heart of decaying Euclid gets by strictly on word-of-satisfied-mouth.     The smells wafting from the cardboard box insisted that I sample my purchase on the short drive home. On first impression, the pizza itself reminded me of pizza hut. Even hot, the crust was a crunchy, buttery treat. On second taste, I noted that the Bazaar had taken their food-craft to a level beyond that achieved by the pizza retail chains that dominate the Italian-Takeout landscape. First, Carmella's sauce is immensely flavorful, with a sweetness that is balanced well with the spiciness of herbs. Refusing to skimp on ingredients, they have covered all of this with a generous mound of golden-toasted cheese.      This balance in flavors, ingredients and abundant toppings speak loudly of their devotion to time, attention and skill. It so drastically sets them apart from their competition that I would gladly raise a slice high in the air as a testament to the potential victory for Craftsmanship over Mass-production that mom-and-pops everywhere should aspire to.    As to their service, I have only ever seen one employee behind the counter. This man quick and personable; equally adept at customer service and the running of the ovens. He explains to me that his business strategy is to keep prices low, even if that means limited commercial exposure and requiring all payments to be made in cash. His greatest goal is to ensure that he can maintain the quality and low price of his product.     I've got to say, he makes it a hard strategy to refute. Even though I would like to see this establishment find its proper recognition, what he is already doing seems to have kept him a shining beacon for the last fifty years, as the sun has gradually set on Euclid as a town.    It is also worth mentioning that as pleasant as I found my car ride with the pizza to be, the real surprise came the next day when I discovered it to be just as delectable when eaten cold. Over the next 12 hours I toyed with the idea of reheating my leftovers, but was never able to overcome the immediate gratification of yet another slice fresh from the fridge.    Carmella's Pizza Bazaar...be it difficult to find, necessitating cash out of pocket, requiring that I find the time before dinner to take a drive, or all three...I have found these obstacles to be readily overcome for the sake of a quality experience. An experience demanding to be repeated in the very near future."}
{"text":"Love this place!   In business since 1957.  Awesome sweet tomato sauce.   The large pizza here is truly LARGE!   You can keep your cheap,  lousy $5 \"pizza\" places.    When I want REAL pizza,  I go to Carmella's!  Stopped by last night for the first time since moving out of town (3 years ago) and to my delight they're still making the same incredibly delicious cheesy pies! Bring cash though cuz they currently cannot accept credit cards.   Old skool!   Thank you Carmella's!"}
{"text":"This pizza is made with love Carmella's is a very good restaurant it's like a secret Hidden Gem in Euclid. I lived in Euclid for 3 years and never knew it was here. The pizza prices are normal and the ingredients are fresh. One of my favorite pizza spots."}
{"text":"Love this place. The pizza is phenomenal !! Definitely one of the best pizza places in Cleveland area."}
{"text":"The pizza has a 35 min wait but it is well worth it the pizza has a lil sweet taste to it with real hand rolled meat cheese melts and very stringy . At first glance you would drive by the place on the corner but once you are in you can tell they put time in to make you a work of art that will have you coming back for more"}
{"text":"Hmmm... So I saw this little \"gem\" one day on Yelp when I was searching for a new pizza place since Edison's Pizza is sooo far away from me and Angela Mia's is a luxury treat but I'm not always looking to take a field trip into the hood. I was shocked to see such wonderful ratings for this place, 5 Stars let me be the judge of that!!!  Until... I was on the elevator and I had to stop and ask a guy, \"Hey where'd you get that pizza? It stank so good!!\" And he said, \"Blah blah blah... Carmella's... best pizza in town!\"   Say what???  So I'm ordering one today. Pepperoni, Onions, Black Olives and Hot Peppers. It better be on point...  DISSAPOINTED!  Agh! I though that this would be amazingly good pizza and it was not! The crust is just wayyyy too thick, and annoying to chew through. It's too much bread and too little topping. Not at all worth the $18 I payed for it. I wish I would get my money back. This may be great pizza to some people but defiantly not to me. This pizza makes me appreciate the fact that this was my last fun food choice before I start on my new healthy path. I so looking forward to my salad after eating this pizza. I'll travel to Tremont if I want good pizza.   Also my hot peppers where more sweet then hot. Ew!"}
{"text":"Carmellas. What else needs to be said? Have been eating here since the 1960's when you could sit in a booth, play the jukebox and enjoy the best pizza in Cleveland. Same family owned since it opened and the recipe has not changed."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza joint of all time. My family has been going here since they were teens and it's still just as good today. The employees are wonderful and the pizza is fantastic. Prices are fair, the ingredients are fresh, and you can tell the pies are made with love. Long live Carmella's!"}
{"text":"This place has great pizza. I remember coming here after getting out at St Joe's and getting a large pepperoni and Sausage. Eight years later I still get the same pizza. The one important thing to remember is to bring cash. The staff and the owner are all very personal employees. Definitely going to be placing an order today as soon as they open."}
{"text":"Really good taste like homemade best pizza in euclid priced just right for the budget if you have not tryed you should try it you will not be disappointed at all"}
