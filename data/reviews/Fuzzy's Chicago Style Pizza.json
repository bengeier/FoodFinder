{"text":"I was very disappointed.  My wife I tried Fuzzy's based on the reviews and both of us found this pizza to be below par.  Nothing like good Chicago pizza.  We ordered a sausage and mushroom 16\" and I think we got 12 mushrooms and 8 pieces of sausage.  The pizza had lots of cheese but very little flavor.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've ever tasted ,  sometimes you eat something and one thing might be bad about it , but this pizza everything is bad the topping s sauce chee but especially the crust 
Just to eat it had to use a lot of parmasean and crushed pepper and ranch , 

Won't be coming back"}
{"text":"The hunt for a great local pizza continues.  When I hear Chicago style pizza, I think deep dish, ooey-gooey, rich and delicious.  This was the other kind, the thin kind, with a crunchy crust, and cut into squares rather than wedges.  We might have liked the crust if it had some flavor, but truly it had the taste and texture of a matzo cracker.  I don't think it could have been more flavorless if a deliberate effort had been made to make it so.  After the first slice, neither Hon or I ate any of the crust.  Well, Hon tried a few extra bites because he couldn't believe it was so tasteless.  The rest of it, we cracked apart and fed to the birds.

Despite the really awful crust, the pizza toppings had good flavor.  The sauce was tasty and there was just enough of it.  We got a large pizza with sausage, onion, tomato, and black olive.  All toppings were abundant, except the sausage.  Fuzzy was a little stingy with his sausage. Too bad, because it tasted great. The cheese was plentiful and tasted okay, but I have a feeling it wasn't 100% real.

The restaurant is hidden around the corner from the rest of the Albertson's plaza. We did take out, but there are tables for casual dining in and they offer delivery.  Service was quick and friendly and the menu has plenty of other options, such as Vienna dogs, Italian beef, and wings.  If we ever try Fuzzy's again (unlikely), we'll order anything but the magnificently dismal pizza.  One final note, it's a Pepsi place.  No Coke.

Next!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch, as I'm a fan of supporting local as much as possible.  Lunch was good, had a Chicago dog and fries, which both met my criterium.  Had a chat with the owner (I presume) and expressed my wish to order delivery later for my kids and I.  The owner said this was no problem, just call by 4:15 pm latest.  So I called at 4:15 to be told very rudely by somebody else that they had sent the driver home so they could close early and basically tough sh**.  No apology, no rational, and he argued with me at the time that I called while I was looking at the time ON MY PHONE.  Unbelievable."}
{"text":"With regret I must report that as a very long time patron of Fuzzys under the previous ownership (another Yelp report stated that it is the previous owner, not true, this is the owner previous to the most recent owner)  I can report that I just left the place after ordering my usual, the 2 hot dog combo. Price is increased by $2.00 /-.  But that is OK for what should have been  the same old results. NO way................!!  The hot dogs are of very cheap inferior grade and have a poor taste. Chicago style dogs are all beef like Vienna not sure what these are filled with, I don't think I want to know. The buns had been steamed and on the side next to the basket were mussy and inedible. The owner or manager made no attempt to ask how my meal was and stood behind the counter talking to the counter help . This review would not have been necessary had she paid attention to her new clientele a must for a new business. Its a real shame as I frequented Fuzzys at least one or two times a week."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service! Nice little place to get a good pizza or a quick bite to eat! Joe does a great job with his place!!!"}
{"text":"Came in a couple of weeks ago with 2 out of town guests after bragging about how good the pizza  is and the closest thing to Chicago thin crust.  Well we were disappointed to say the least. Waited an hour and 15 minutes for our order. Granted they were very busy but the person ahead of us placed his order for a large group and not only were they served well before us but were finished eating before we got our order. No apology for the wait and worst of all the pizza crust was terrible. We were regulars here but no more."}
{"text":"The love hate that is Fuzzys. 

You don't get a whole lot for your money. 

The thicker crust saves this from being a lower rating. 

If you want something different than your typical pizza, go to Fuzzys. There are plenty of other places to get great Za at though."}
{"text":"Wow.. where do I even begin. Last night we ordered a pizza (with pepperoni mushrooms and olives), 2 salads, the baked ziti, and an Italian beef sandwich. 

First off, the pizza was an absolute atrocity. Undercooked flat crust, bland marinara, and canned mushrooms. The pie was cut in to random squares. THIS IS NOT CHICAGO style anything. This is something I'd order at a budget hotel in Las Vegas at 3am after a night of gambling and binge drinking and put in the microwave!! This pizza couldn't even pass for bar food in the seediest of bars. I ate one piece (square) and I literally threw the pizza in the trash, which is where it belongs. Complete garbage.

Secondly, the baked ziti came in a styrofoam container lined with aluminum foil. WTF? Who takes pasta and piles it on to aluminum foil with mozzarella and bakes it? Even Domino's pizza doesn't do this and they're 4 times cheaper than this sad excuse for a restaurant. Most restaurants would give you an aluminum container with a proper lid. You know the kind of container where when you dig in to it with a fork you're not getting pieces of aluminum in your mouth!! The pasta was edible once you removed the aluminum flakes from the melted and burnt on cheese. 

The worst part about the baked ziti is I found a black inch long nylon bristle from a brush or cleaning utensil in the marinara. Unfortunately it made it in to my mouth. I threw the ziti in the trash next to the pizza. There's no excuse for poor food handling. Train your cooks.

The Italian beef sandwich was well seasoned, and sliced thin. Problem? It showed up with no cheese, no garnishments, nothing. It was literally dry meat on a dry bun. Thankfully we had some stuff in the fridge to spruce it up. Tossed it in the oven for 10 mins and ate that. 

They deserve ZERO stars. I won't order from this place again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is clean and inviting.  My order was taken accurately and the cashier was very nice and helpful. They show to have an A rating on their last health inspection which is always good to see. My meal didn't take too long and it was delivered to my table. The Chicago dog was good as I expected it would be. The Italian beef and sausage sandwich was decent. A little less ju on the sandwich and better quality bread would greatly improve it. Overall a good value for okay food but their customer service is awesome."}
{"text":"When it's my turn to cook, I pick up the phone an order Fuzzy's. Thin crispy crust pizza sliced in easy to handle squares - just the way I like it. I have had the opportunity to enjoy Fuzzy's dine-in, pick-up and delivery numerous times over the years. The owners have changed a few times and it has always been consistent. 

Fuzzy's is as close to Chicago-style pizza you can get without a plane ride. Vienna dogs, Italian beef , wings and pan pizza options are available. Chicago sports memorabilia and bold colors mark the decor. 

Good prices fast delivery gets a hot pie to the door."}
{"text":"This is the real deal - Chicago deliciousness!!!  My family is from Chi-town and my dad lives for the sausage Italian beef sandwich!!  I personally love the Italian beef with onions and cheese.  The bread soaks up the juicy goodness and gets slightly soggy.  The cheese is gooey and just amazing!  

Then there is their pizza!!  Thin and crisp - A+ in my book!  The people are super nice and helpful.  Their goal is to keep it authentic...they are meeting this goal 100%!  We go here all the time, this is not change anytime soon!!  GO EAT HERE!! It is OMG Delicious!!!

Thanks Fuzzy's!!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews but decided to come anyway since we had a gift card. I'm not sure what people are talking about.  Maybe they don't know what Chicago pizza is. We forgot to all for thick crust, but pizza was good.  Wings were bomb."}
{"text":"I've had better frozen pizza.  Crust is like eating cardboard.  For Chicago style try Barro's, Oregano's or Rosat's."}
{"text":"I am usually pretty generous on my reviews, but considering I have been to this place a few times I simply find my overall experience average at best. It is undeniable that they have pretty good pizza and decent wings, but the customer service that I have always experienced here is just okay. I am not very demanding when it comes to customer service like some, but a smile here and there and appreciation for customers would be nice. Customer service goes a long way in my book, and I have found a couple other pizza joints that offer great customer service that I would rather frequent. 

We arrived with a restaurant.com coupon that was purchased just a few days prior only to find that they weren't accepting them anymore. Hmmm, that wasn't very settling considering I bought a few of them. My question was, \"Why are they available for purchase if you are no longer accepting them?\" Only to be told, \"Well, they shouldn't be on there anymore and they will probably be taking them off soon.\" 

Meh... I think I can find better customer service with a smile at Grande Pizza just down the road where they make an effort to remember my name and greet with a warm smile."}
{"text":"Fuzzy's serves up Chicago-style thin crust pizza, and does it well. I've hit them up for a pie a couple of times now, and have been super-pleased. The crust is light and crisp, the sauce is nice and tomatoey, and the amount and quality of toppings just right.

My only issue is that sometimes they are a bit slow. I rationalize this by assuming that they are making my pizza fresh, and that takes a little time.

Also, the wings are pretty tasty too. There were lots of drummies in the mix, and I like that."}
{"text":"This place is literally in walking distance from my apt. Although i try not to eat here often not because i do not enjoy it but if i did I'd be the \"typical obese American\" if i did. Its THAT good. But on occasion when i feel like, what the hey, then i spring and splurge on this place. 

The pizza is AMAZING. The wings aren't the greatest if they were this place would of got that fifth star from me. 

Oh and beer might be nice. But then again i know how expensive liquor liscenses are. It's amazing. Anyway, i suggest everyone try this place. BEST pizza in the west valley."}
{"text":"Yes Fuzzys is back. Good food . Good service. We are happy . We had a thin pepperoni pizza and garlic bread with cheese. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Good service.  Some of the younger employees aren't as friendly, but they try.  The food is affordable, tasty, and delivery is fast.  They are consistently good."}
{"text":"I think frozen pizza or even Peter Piper Pizza is better than this. The sauce taste like it came from a can & crust needs serious hekp. Needed to be covered in crushed red peppers & parmesan cheese in order to finish the little lunch size pizza. Only came in since it was walking distance from ford dealership & I was starving, while waiting for oil change. Will never recommend this place."}
{"text":"Of the two people I interacted with during my visit here, one was very nice and one was very rude so it's hard to rate them as far as customer service. The nice staff member was helpful with our order since they are apparently under new management and have some differences between the menu and what they actually make now. The food was good, definitely not Chicago style but not bad. We had a coupon originally, which is why we came, but since they're under new management they wouldn't accept it, so that was frustrating. Overall, it wasn't the worst experience, but I'm not sure I'd return."}
{"text":"The quality went down after the old owners took over. Pizza crust is hard, they charge for little things that other places like this provide with a purchase."}
{"text":"Had a coupon for this restaurant. So after out foster kids therapy and on our way home we stopped by for dinner. There was a hand written sign on the door announcing they will be closing at 7:00 pm. Now we got there around 6:40, but they had no problem with us coming in and knowing we would have a party of seven. 
We ordered a large pepperoni pizza, their Chicago style. Now this is where I have a problem understanding. I thought thin crust pizza was New York style, deep dish was chcago? Now I was just in Chicago a few weeks ago and had a Lou Malnatis deep dish and that was amazing. Anyway fuzzy offers a thin crust Chicago style pizza. We really liked their pizza, loved the spicy sauce, and you can really taste the cheese. We also had the Italian beef sandwich, mac and cheese for Naomi, spaghetti and meatballs for Natalie, hot dog for Nathan, chicken fingers for Neci, and Kailey wanted to eat pizza and wings with me. I really can't complain about anything here. The food was great, especially the beef sandwich and pizza. The employees was great and did not rush us even though we were there after closing. Just was warning, give your food a little time to cool off. They are served piping hot. Great time, great service, and great food."}
{"text":"Not impressed and won't be back.  Service was great. We came with our restaurants.com coupon and they did not charge us the 18% tip the rule said was required which was nice but we still tipped them well. 

Place is clean and roomy. Has a TV but was hard to hear over the noise and it wasn't very crowded.

We ordered the 20\" pizza and mild wings.  Was happy about the large sizes. We had pepperonie and garlic topping with their regular thin crust.  Wing had good flavor and was not overly drenched in sauce. They were meaty and plump.
Pizza was very sad. Crust was flavorless cardboard looked and tasted like a premade frozen type.  Sauce tasted ordinary and blah out of a can.  Not enough toppings and the garlic I think was from a jar not fresh.

Won't be back."}
{"text":"This may be the worst pizza I've had since moving here in the 80s.

We ordered a mushroom, sausage pizza Saturday night.  The only thing you can taste is the sweet sauce.  The mushrooms are canned, which is ok, but there just was no flavor.

You wanna a good pie, try, Rays, Rossiti's, Red Devil, NYPD."}
{"text":"their 'thin crust' is not... it is hard cracker crust. NO Flavor. 

The toppings and sauce were fine but the crust was bad... and I love good thin crust (chewy, very thin, italian style)"}
{"text":"Ordered the lunch special today. 8\" cheese pizza and a drink for $5. The pizza was ok, dough was hard. Staff was very friendly. Not sure what all the Chicago pizza hype is? I want to come back and try the hot dogs, they looked good!"}
{"text":"Eat there all the time love everything on the menu..love the Chicago dogs and their french fries...this place is a must do"}
{"text":"The people who reviewed this place and complain that it is not \"Chicago Style\" pizza have obviously never LIVED in Chicago. I was born and raised in Chi-town, and let me tell you, there are two different kinds of \"Chicago Style\" pizza and Fuzzy's does one of them absolutely right.

That big thick gooey deep dish from place like Geno's or Giordano's is what TOURISTS think of as Chicago style pizza. Deep dish is delicious, but it's not the everyday pizza Chicagoans actually eat. Growing up there, I ate that kind of pizza maybe once a year as a treat, and it was a big family circus to pile in the car and go eat at Lou Malnati's. 

I've been to Geno's, NYPD and even Pizzeria Bianco, but Fuzzy's is what tastes like HOME to me. It's what every mom and pop pizza shop in Chicago sells, complete with 1985 Bears jerseys and old Michael Jordan posters half falling off the wall. 

Fuzzy's is the true \"Chicago Style\" pizza that your everyday Chicagoan gets delivered for family pizza night every week: Cracker crust with a thin layer of crumbs stuck to the bottom. Super sweet tomato sauce. Chewy bubblegum cheese. Canned mushrooms and chunks of real Italian Sausage ripped off the link. And of course it's cut in squares. 

But don't limit yourself to the pizza at Fuzzy's. The rest of their menu is true authentic Chicago. Vienna beef dogs on poppyseed buns piled with all the right toppings. Italian beef sandwiches drowning in juice. Pizza puffs, french fries and fried mushrooms stuffed in paper wrappers, grease spots leaking through...

There are a few places in Phoenix that do \"Chicago\" right, but Fuzzy's is one of the best. There's no pretense here. This isn't gourmet. They don't use imported cheese or fancy water in their dough. Fuzzy's is just like Mama's, Papa's, Louie's or any of the other no-name hole-in-the-wall grease joints tucked away in strip malls in the city or 'burbs of Chicago."}
{"text":"YUMMY! We ordered the buffalo chicken, bbq chicken, and plain cheese pizzas. All were amazing!"}
{"text":"Wow, they make a REALLY excellent Italian Beef sandwich....just like Chicago.  I LOVED the sauce and sausage on the pizza;however, they need to perfect the crust....it seems pre-made, not like CHicago, but the sauce, cheese, sausage is JUST like Chicago...amazing.  I hope they make the crust change.  We will be back when we are in the area."}
{"text":"It's opened again under the original owner from 2002ish.  Excellent Pizza, my favorite.  Pizza is cut into small squares, perfect pizza for little kids.  My kids love it, they eat more of this pizza then any other pizza we've had from other places."}
{"text":"Best Italian Chicago Beef sandwich I have ever had. Friendly people, hard to find location and great food."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, arrived fast and fresh. I've been wanting to order from here for a year, but the reviews were so mixed, so I finally gave in. Ordered a pizza, with meatballs and pepperoni, and some cheesy bread. 

The cheesy bread is a hoagie bun toasted with cheese and some garlic butter. Nothing special but tasty with the red sauce they send with it. 

The pizza is a frozen crust perfectly round pizza,  so it's not a greasy floppy pizza like you find on the east coast. It's a firm crust you can actually pick up and eat. The crust reminds me of the Chef Boyarde homemade pizza kit crust my mom would make as a kid. Tasteless but gets the job done. The pizza sauce and the toppings save the pizza from being bland. The cheese is fantastic too. 

I'll order from here again for sure, if only they would proof their pizza crusts overnight in a cooler and use them the next day the crust would have more life to it."}
{"text":"I stopped in at Fuzzy's last week in my further adventures in Food of the NW Valley, since my office was moved to Peoria in February.  I had checked out the previous Yelp reviews and was very excited to give it a try.  I invited a couple coworkers along for this journey.  One guy that had been to Fuzzy's in the past turned down the invitation stating, the pizza is \"ok\".  We decided to still give it a shot and called in our order for pickup.  I went with the classic, 8\" thin crust with pepperoni.  My 2 coworkers decided to get side salads and split an 8\" thick crust with mushroom and onion.  We picked up our order and added fountain drinks when we paid. We also noticed that they offer a 2 slice with drink lunch special for about $5. Both pizzas looked good and the salads also looked pretty decent for a side salad.  After we all finished, we came to the same conclusion... the pizza was \"ok\".   The service and prices are good making it a great place to grab a quick lunch.  8\" pizzas start at $4.50 and lunch special about the same.  I will probably go back to try their Italian Beef at some point, to give them another shot."}
{"text":"Great food, great customer service, and the prices are right.  We're there every weekend.  Give it a try you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Excellent Pan pizza, as well as other Chicago style fair.
Must use Vienna beef for dogs to be \"authentic \" and Fuzzy does."}
{"text":"Chicago style pizza? NOT!!!
This was more like AZ pizza.  You know the kind they try to make but it just isn't pizza. I don't think the people who run this establishment have ever been to Chicago. If ever in Chicago the best pizza there is Genos East.
Nothing was right with this pizza. Crust is supposed to be a corn meal crust and filled with sauce and lots of cheese  The kind  you have to eat with a fork and spoon and can't pick it up.  This was a crust that reminded me of a cracker. The sauce was dry as well as the cheese. Worst pizza I have ever eaten in my life.
I give it 1 star for the name \"Fuzzy\" which must mean they love cats, otherwise I couldn't even give them one. Was I didn't find any cat fuzz on my pizza.
There is only one place in AZ that knows how to make pizza and that is NYPD.  The Sicilian tastes just like it does when you are walking down the street in THe Big Apple and buy a slice at the window.,
Well so much for trying something new. What a disappointment./
I am now online ordering a Sicilian from NYPD. At least I know with this one I can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great pizza, great wings, great fries, great lunch specials, but best of all are their Chicago dogs. They are the next best thing to the kind you get in Chicago. I've been through the Chicago airport I've had good Chicago dogs, these aren't them but pretty darn close. Can't really find anything to complain about other than the fact that they do not have orange soda and no military discount. In this day and age and with so many young soldiers running around West Arizona, and with Luke AFB just down the road you'd think the military discount would be a given. But I can't hate, not every business can spare the expense, but when you do come across it, it is a nice little thank you to those who deserve it most. Otherwise, good job Fuzzy's, keep up the good work. 

And if it does ever become financially feasible you might want to consider a 10% break for the troops, I'm just sayin'."}
{"text":"In my mind, this is how it goes down: NY style pizza: flat. Chicago style pizza: thick, rich and meaty. So, whenever I see a \"Chicago\"-themed restaurant, I expect nothing short of all their pies as tall as an inch. Or higher.

I don't think that's the case here at Fuzzy's, but that said, the thin I was served was good - I would just never say this came from Chicago lovers. The party I was with also ordered their \"thick\" pizza. Again, it was tasty, but not thick enough.

The place is small and really hidden - GPS can't hardly find it, they just gave me the street corner. It's clean inside, and the wait staff was very friendly.

It's out of my way from my side of town and unless there's another birthday party, unfortunately, I probably won't make the trek. I'll stick with genuine Chicago's Deep Dish pizza, such as Vito's on 43rd Ave/Northern, even if that's all in my own mind."}
{"text":"Outstanding Chicago-style menu, the hot dogs have the requisite green relish, the pizza is wonderful, the Italian Beef is very authentic. And of course, Fuzzy's has the Italian Beef/Italian Sausage combo sandwich. All in all, good food, good prices, and an outstanding owner!"}
{"text":"have only had take out, can say its not the normal pizza... i kinda like not having a thick doughy  crust, leaves more to the toppings being the flavor. love that its cut into squares and not wedges, much easier to handle"}
{"text":"Primarily because of the deep dish pizza quality I'm giving Fuzzy's 4 stars.  Cheese is that high quality, rich milky mozzarella and it is accompanied by that extra tangy version of tomato sauce that is somewhat common in Chicago.  Deep dish crust was lightly crisped & semi soft on the bottom, and the same at the end though much thicker.  Delicious chewy breadiness inside, and a golden brown crispy on the outside.  Light cornmeal dusted on the bottom.

I did not try the thin crust but the table adjacent to me had several, and they appeared much thicker than what I normally associate with Chicago thin crust (almost cracker thin).  I would describe it as a medium looking crust on a pizza that just happens to be cut into squares.

Toasted raviolis, fried mushrooms, fried mozz, wings, etc. round out the menu, and an assortment of soft drinks is available.  No beer from what I could see.  Prices were reasonable.

Chicago Cubs and other Chicago sports memorabilia decorate the walls to make you feel at home.   Extremely casual dining here - some folks with those sleeveless cut-off shirts (sorry, no mullets though!)

Location is on the West facing side of a strip mall that shoulders a grocery store there on Bell."}
