{"text":"Over all I like it, but its not going to be my main grocery run.   I like having all the organic options, especially for the produce, beans and grains. I hate the parking situation, and their prices are significantly higher than I expect, even for organic."}
{"text":"Though I can't say I've taken advantage of all it has to offer, I really like the idea of a co-op. It's been in the community for years and I feel good knowing I'm shopping somewhere local and cooperatively owned. They aren't the biggest grocer around, but they do have a nice selection and it's good quality food and it's definitely clean too. The produce is fresh and the variety is nice too. They also have a salad bar and hot food selection that are very tasty. They have a cooler section that has prepared food as well that is pretty great. They have a lemon pepper tofu sandwich that is absolutely amazing! The prices are decent... they're slightly higher for some things (but not all!) compared to a commercial grocery store, but they're cheaper than whole foods and I believe the quality is worth the tiny bit extra. They also offer lose (not prepackaged) goods such as nuts, granola, beans, teas, herbs, etc... that I really like. It's a fantastic place to go if you are vegan or vegetarian, but even if you are neither and just enjoy high quality and local food it's a place I certainly recommend. The parking lot and street parking gets a bit full at time and it can be a little tricky getting a spot at certain times, but I don't think that should hold anyone back form going."}
{"text":"The only place I grocery shop! I love the fresh local produce. I love that I am a member.  They have recently been remodeling the place, which has only made it even better! I feel lucky that I live so close to the Co-op!"}
{"text":"I'm grateful that we have the co-op so close.  Prices are standard for a co-op or organic/ community markets.   I appreciate [and will pay for] the great selection of local produce, bulk goods, and vegetarian staples.   We balance it with our garden and Trader Joe's.   We're members and I appreciate the whole community building aspect."}
{"text":"The co-op is an invaluable resource for Pittsburgh.   First of all, the selection is fantastic. No matter what kind of health-conscious diet you follow from vegan to paleo - they've got what you need. My favorite items here that you can't really find many other places are raw milk (legal in PA, woo!) and the local meats. The prices on the meat here are higher than most butchers in the area, but on par with the lesser quality meats at Whole Foods - choose your co-op!  I seldom find the produce prices to be ridiculously high. For example, I recently purchased mushrooms at $1.99 per lb. and strawberries for $2.50 per lb., which seem to be two of the more expensive items at any given store. Their sales are worth planning a shopping trip around.  When I followed a plant-based diet, the bulk section was my holy grail. For grains, flours, nuts, and seeds, they have a wide variety of unique products. I also love that you can fill a jar and buy it right at the store - most other bulk sections in the 'Burgh don't have this.  All in all, I like being able to go into a store and not have to sift through the produce to see if it's what I want (organic, local) because it all is! Naturally, they do sell tropical fruits and things that simply do not grow here, but everything is very clearly labeled in its origin and growing method.  The employees are always friendly and helpful as well. The only terrible thing about this place is the fact that there is almost NEVER parking - I've parked in the lot maybe  ten times out of the ~40 or so times that I've shopped here. I don't mind the walk down, but with heavy bags in my hand, the walk up the street can be tough!"}
{"text":"The East End Food Co-op has just about everything you would expect to find in a food co-op, except for--sadly--a great selection of local beers.  This tragic fault does not rest with the co-op, of course, but with the state of Pennsylvania.  But you probably don't care because you know where all of these elusive \"beer distributors\" are located.  So, to get back on track, I like the local produce focus here, and some of the cheeses appeared to be local, as well.  Nice staff, decent prices, good little salad bar.  I love co-ops, and if you do, too, then you will love the East End Food Co-op."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool little spot I discovered while in town for work.  They have a great veggie lunch buffet (hot and cold) and some GREAT coffee.  Will definitely be stopping by again for groceries before I leave town."}
{"text":"Great, local co-op. They have many awesome health food products.  I LOVE their cold to-go foods and baked goods--it is way tastier and better priced than Whole Foods! Their hot food bar is pretty good. I love the vegan sausage though.  The parking lot can get rather tight on the weekends.  If you shop there often you should become a member. If you happen to move out of Pittsburgh, they will refund your membership dues."}
{"text":"I love stopping by here for a juice and take-out food from the cafe.  It's one of the few places I've found in Pittsburgh serving fresh-pressed and organic juices. My favorite juice combo is the carrot, apple, and ginger, aka \"Ginger Wabbit\".  Although they can be a little pricey, certain juices are sometimes on special, so keep your eye out!  They also have plenty of smoothie and coffee bar options if juices and wheat grass shots aren't really your thing.  Don't be afraid to ask the staff member for some recommendations!  The hot food/salad bar has great vegetarian and vegan options.  Usually the selections include roasted veggies, homemade soups, tofu and tempeh options, kale, and some kind of grain.  On the back wall of the store, they have a selection of already packaged salads, sandwiches, mock tuna and chicken salad, hummus, marinated tofu, great to grab and go or enjoy for lunch in the cafe.  I can't comment much on the store selection, because I mostly stick to the prepared foods and juice bar.  They also have a large selection of nutritional bars, including the local companies such as Barre and NuGo.  Don't be intimidated to give East End Food Co-op a shot, the staff is totally helpful and the healthy, fresh lunch options are worth stopping in for!"}
{"text":"The East End Food Co-op has become my favorite place to get groceries. I've recently changed to eating vegan and this place has everything I need. The bulk food section is awesome from all types of organic flour to organic candy, granola, rice, pasta, teas, coffee, even bulk tamari. You can bring your own container and fill it up. If not, bags and containers are available. All different types of vegan (as well as some non-vegan) canned goods, soymilks, vegan cheeses, and meat substitutes are available. There is so much crammed into the place sometimes its hard to find what you need, but staff is very friendly and are always there to help. It doesn't have the glitz and glam of Whole Foods but the prices are a little better. If you become a member, once a month you can purchase items at a pretty good discount."}
{"text":"I was only here one afternoon, but this is a really great co-op.  It's not huge but seems to have a lot going on.  While I didn't get to browse around that much, I appreciated their great section of prepared sandwiches and various salads.  They also have a hot food and salad buffet that so hit the spot for lunch on the day I visited - quinoa with mushrooms and sliced almonds, grilled yellow and green zucchini - healthy, wholesome, and awesome!"}
{"text":"Yes.  I love the co-op.  It's one of the very few places in Pgh I've been able to find unpasteurized juice, besides my own counter top.  Because my counter top contains a juicer, which is awesome, but such a pain to clean.  I love getting lunch here.  The onion Parmesan soup is amazing."}
{"text":"It's disappointing that you got lukewarm service, Erina.  I've had pretty consistently good vibes (har har--get it?--hippie reference) there from the staff, who've been enthusiastic about helping me find what I need.  Hands down, this place beats Whole Foods for price and general atmosphere, and their salad and hot bar is my go-to when I don't feel like cooking.  Absolutely GREAT bulk section with a wide variety of grains, legumes, and pastas.  Killer cookies and baked goods.   On the other hand--if I lived on my own, I could do all my shopping here.  But, since I don't--I can't.  It's tough to stock a household kitchen solely from the EEFC--I mean, I can't really afford to regularly buy $15 laundry detergent.   Realistically, the Co-op can't serve most of us for one-stop shopping.  But it's worth it to put down a few extra pennies for potatoes or juice to support a genuinely community-oriented business."}
{"text":"I used to work there and I just love East End Food Co-op.  The place has definitely got soul, awesome folks at Co-op.  So many local options, such good produce, and awesome prepared foods.  Sure some of the prices are high, but if you learn to shop it, there are also great values everywhere.   And I really appreciate that they stick their neck out, and are spending time and money in the fight to label GMO's.  It's important issues like this that really define our Co-op IMO."}
{"text":"The co-op is great!  When we had to put our children on a diet free of gluten and dairy, we were lost -- until we found the East End Food Co-op. That was 10 years ago and I've shopped there weekly ever since. It provides for all of our gluten-free, dairy-free needs - and even allows the opportunity to purchase in bulk as a member. I also love buying grains, beans, etc. from the bulk bins, fair trade products and many daily food items like cereals, nut butters, snacks, etc. They now stock meat/poultry from local farms and specialize in Vegan options. Also, have to mention the awesome produce section, stocked mostly from local farms."}
{"text":"This store is quite expensive, I was shocked a cream costs 13-14$ whereas the same one costs 11-12$ at Whole Foods and at online store (http://www.vitacost.com/weleda-calendula-diaper-care) around 7$ .   The store seems to be a kind of a ripoff. Also I got food there which made me quite sick - tabbouleh. My diarrhea didn't want to stop for a day - my first experience like that with food from a so called health food store.  There are other options to this store like for instance Whole Foods which is only 8 min away. Whole foods has very often sales which this one doesn't.   Also there was a strange old/rotten smell going through the Co-Ops place - indicator something is wrong.  I think they are owned by 8000 members, so enough people spreading the word that they are great.  But the truth is - its an expensive store with big attitude, and very little to offer."}
{"text":"This is a great co-op. The store is very clean and organized well, with a wide variety of organic, vegan, and vegetarian options on the shelves. There are plenty of bins and dispensers where you can purchase nearly anything imaginable in bulk: rolled oats, trail mix, beans, spices, honey... the list goes on! The produce and prepared foods are very fresh and enticing as well. Though the prices are rather high, the quality of the food here can't be beat. If you want organic, exotic foods in Pittsburgh, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This is such a fantastic place to buy your groceries!  The store in on the smaller side, but they are well stocked with lots of fresh vegetables, fruits, and other organic treats. I LOVED the fact that many of their items are local, especially the delicious bread!  Everybody was also very nice and helpful. Great place to come check out if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"I just found this place a month back and I'm kind of blown away by how awesome it is. Fresh produce, awesome prepared salads and dips, bulk everything, natural cleaners, and plenty of hippie garbage you can't help but fill your shelves with. The best part is that they try to stock up with locally sourced produce, milk, and meat. And you can get a good discount if you purchase stock in the co-op."}
{"text":"Organic, vegan, vegetarian, juice bar, and much more.  This place is friggin heaven.    When I made the initial switch to vegetarian a few years ago I struggled.  Not from the desire, but from a lack of options.  Then I found the Co-Op.   In my opinion the Co-Op is just as valuable as public libraries!!!"}
{"text":"Used to love the Co-op despite its flaws.  Continuous turnover, especially at higher levels, poor communication to customers, blatantly hostile/condescending attitude from some staff.   All been going on for years. There was some improvement for awhile, but it has gotten worse.  A few individual employees are pleasant and competent, but the organization overall has some serious issues with ethics/transparency.   They're actually worse than some large corporate stores in these areas.  Pittsburgh has many choices for healthy food - farmers markets and CSAs - and that's where we purchase much of our food now.  Suggest you do the same."}
{"text":"A lot of vegan options.  Kind of pricey. Parking is not ideal but the do have bike parking.  The staff is knowledgeable,  helpful and friendly.  They always seem to be adding new options to their selection.  It seems small and can get pretty crowded inside when busy."}
{"text":"As a displaced west-coaster, I appreciate a store like this in Pittsburgh.   I like the bulk goods and spices because you can take as much as you need, you get the spices whole and they put them in big jars so you can sniff them if you want before you buy (the downside to that is that every time the jars get opened the spices probably lose some oils), and there's a huge selection.   This place has my quinoa, pearled barley, spelt flour, and nutritional yeast.   Some of the vegetables pop out at me and I'm tempted to buy a lemon or some really ripe piece of fruit. Usually I don't though. During the summer they were selling fresh herbs in pots. That was really tempting. Once they sold kittens. That was amazing.   It doesn't hurt that its right by the climbing wall, fencing, gymnastics, and bike shop."}
{"text":"I'm definitely a fan of East End Food Co-op.  Their produce is always very fresh and of really high quality-it keeps really well once you get it home too, and while prices are slightly higher than an average grocery store, it's definitely worth it.  My favorite part of the Co-op is the bulk section-- it's a great way to buy items in the exact quanities you need rather than ending up with way more than you want!  The same goes for the spices--such a bargain!  The Juice bar has great smoothies and juices--they're a little pricier than I'm used to, but great for a bit of a splurge!"}
{"text":"This is indeed a special place. It is a true neighborhood market, with a community vibe, with unique to everyday grocery items. Love! Having frequented a mom/pop place exactly like this back home in NYC, the Co-op gives me that good ol' homey feel, here in my new Pgh digs. The fresh produce is organic, locally sourced, and varied. There's oils, honeys, grains, nuts, candies, spices, oh my! to buy in weight for exactly the amount you need, (see my pics). They've got a vegetarian buffet, I've have had their breakfast which is quite good, I crave it time to time. There's also a salad bar, cheese and charcuterie section, and a smoothie bar. You can get fresh coffee and pastries to go with, including gluten free options. Meat, seafood, dairy, health/beauty products including makeup, and pet products are also available. They don't have the extensive variety of Whole Foods, but they are not slim pickings either. There's lots of unique items to try or experiment with. They're also pricier than WF, but you can definitely find things reasonably priced. There's a small dining area in the front where you can sit and eat too. There's a parking lot but spots can be hard to find, given it's shared with neighboring businesses. The employees are friendly and seem to enjoy working there. Give it a try and support this small local business!"}
{"text":"We are so fortunate to live in an area that has a co-op.  One of the most important things to me is to have the availability of local produce (outside the traditional farmer's markets, that happen primarily in the summer around here) and be able to buy in bulk.  I used to live further east, and would travel the hour, with a baby, to shop at the co-op.  The $100 life-time membership is so worth the benefits.  I'm not sure what to say about the co-op other than JUST GO THERE!  Its a whole different way of shopping for many people in this area.  I feel like I'm giving back to the community every time I go there.  Also, if you're in need of that hard-to-find supplement your doc is talking about, the co-op probably has it.  The selection of local dairy and eggs are really great too.  Although the co-op is definitely pricier than your typical big box store, you get what you pay for.  And, there are tons of sales, coupons and specials each month.  I will always be a faithful member of the co-op.  Oh!  And the café is awesome!  I love the juices and smoothies, and the salad bar and hot foods rival all.  Its the only buffet-style place I can go to where I know I can eat practically everything (ovo-lacto vegetarian).  I love going for a bite, then doing my shopping.  Then, I'm not so hungry while shopping that I buy everything in site!!!!"}
{"text":"It's cool that they have so much unique stuff.  But it's all overpriced."}
{"text":"A great little place. I love their produce, fruits, meats and spices. They carry alot of very hard to find skin care products that I love. They were even the first place in Pittsburgh that carried Carol's Daughter products.   They also carry pre made salads, sandwiches and wraps. Sure it's not as big as I would like but it's still a great place. If you like Whole Foods and Trader Joe's you will like this place as well."}
{"text":"Finest selection and quality of vegetables and produce.  The greens are local and fresh. The selection of herbs and spices, tramendous. The quality of vitamins is also great.  This is truly a great place. Since moving away from Regent Squate it is the thing I miss he most."}
{"text":"Legit eats for the veggie spirit animal inside all of us. While in PA visiting the lady's people we knew we'd swing thru. Sure enough we got lunch, juice, and enough from grocery and deli to last us the rest of our week long stay. But I'm not ruling out another trip before its all said and done. Polite people working there in a small space. Worth the time and money to get there and eat well.   Reccomends: spelt sourdough from the freezer case, high country kombucha, their burger, and the African yam salad. Big ups juice bar boys for courteous service and delicious product."}
{"text":"Favorite section- bulk Favorite Juice- Johnny Ginger Aid Favorite Prepared Food- Black bean and corn salad Favorite non food item- sunscreen and life factory glasswear"}
{"text":"This co-op is probably great for vegans and vegetarians, but I am Paleo.  I was very happy to find grassfed butter, raw milk, and cheese at reasonable prices.  The bulk foods section was missing a few mainstay items I typically pick up, and the meat selection was very poor.  I would like to see a better listing of which meat is grass fed and grass finished, as many of the farms in the frozen meat section did not have any of that information.  For my future needs, I will be ordering directly from the farm (this co-op sells items from the farm that I will be direct ordering from) at a lower price and will fill in the gaps elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's a grocery store and sells hot food."}
{"text":"The produce is excellent, but I shop for my food at Trader Joes, mostly. There are some things you can only get at the Co op...I just find the food prices crazy.   However--The hot and cold prepared foods and juice bar are Tops. Not just in Pgh, but for the price its the best place to eat healthy lunch, dinner, snack, or sweets.   We love eating at the co op."}
{"text":"I don't know how I would survive without this place.  As a transplant from Arcata, Ca...I need my weird hippy sh*t man. And I prefer to stay away from giant corporations like whole foods as much as possible.  I always go here to buy local honey and get goat's milk soap.  And they have a great selection of pre-made food (I love the tabouli and hummus wrap and the greek salad sandwich) and the salad bar is awesome.  It's true that it's tiny, but as someone who comes from a place that's crawling with stores like this...I feel lucky that Pittsburgh has one at all. I mean, people ask me, \"Where did you get that?\" and I say the East End Co-op, and then they just stare at me blankly. They have no idea what in the frak I'm talking about. \"The what?...where is that?\"  There are bigger places like Right by Nature, but it's just not the same.  The Co-op feels like home."}
{"text":"Lots of great vegan, local, organic, gluten-free, and/or raw food, though some items are quite pricey. Very good rotating-item hot bar for take-out lunch or dinner. Great bulk food selection, including diverse reusable glassware of known tare weight. Fresh fruits and vegetables are right-priced, but processed items like meats, cheeses, and frozen items can be surprisingly expensive. Fairly comprehensive selection, akin to a Whole Foods."}
{"text":"The fruits here are so fresh and sweet. I'm not vegetarian or vegan, however, i appreciate the hot food bar in the back. The smoothies are delicious.   I wish I could shop here more, but it's pricey - even if you are a member."}
{"text":"awesome coop! their prices were pretty good, especially when you shop the deals in their monthly flier. they have an incredible selection of meats/dairy/non-dairy/alternative cold items in addition to your standard dry goods. their prepared foods section is small but mighty! tried the three bean salad along with beet salad and tomato/mozzarella, all were outstanding! cheese selection is on point and their coffee bar had some great iced coffee!  if we lived in the burgh this would definitely be my go-to grocery store!"}
{"text":"They have a large selection of any dietary needs you may need from gluten free, vegan or vegetarian. Their hot food bar and pastries are very good and it's a nice place to get a take away meal. The bulk section also has a nice selection of nuts and different types of flours."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of products considering their size. I would give them 5 stars but they carry bottled water--which confuses me. If they are really passionate about protecting the environment and resources, they should not be selling bottled water, regardless as to how it is sourced."}
{"text":"This is some of the best food on the planet. High quality ingredients. Worth every penny and then some.. The smoothies and juices are made by experts who know what they're doing."}
{"text":"This store been around since the 60s. Never disappoints on great food and people.   Shop small businesses and you never get tired of it!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we have the Food Co-Op in Pittsburgh. Although still fairly expensive, it's less than Whole Foods, and I don't do all my shopping here, just the things I have a hard time finding elsewhere. The bulk selection is one of the best I've ever seen, and I truly appreciate the salad bar on busy days. Their choices are more on the crunchy/hippie side than the high-end gourmet side of things, and it's nice to shop for vegetables without having to turn something down because it's not organic...most of the produce is. The staff is helpful and friendly, and, if someone doesn't know an answer to a question, which can happen with a volunteer, he or she will find out for you. On member 10% discount days it can get very busy, so go early or late."}
{"text":"Kind of small, but I've had excellent luck with produce here: fresh and organic. In-store coffee bar is a nice plus."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh I was like a little kid on Christmas the first time I went into the store. There is simply no other place to buy your certified organic goods in the Pittsburgh surroundings. This includes make-up, produce, nail polish, toiletries, Chapstick, face wash, and everything else you would normally find in a grocery store-- only nearly all of it is organic!   I can't tell you how long I have been looking for a place like this and even though it's slightly pricier than Trader Joe's/Whole Foods (or just about the same), I don't know about you, but I would rather pay for the quality of my food than for a name-brand jar of salsa.  One of the things that I liked most, is that they indicate on the glass of the hot food bar, which ingredients are organic- which I think is fabulous, because we have a right to know what we are eating! They sell Teatree oil, rosewater, and other bamboo cosmetic supplies. Almost all of their spices are organic, and they have a café where you can enjoy food that you might order fresh from the bar. I wish they would open up more places like this in the surrounding Pittsburgh area. This is nothing that others haven't stated already, but the only downfall, in my opinion, is the small parking lot. I don't even care- I will still give it five stars because I'm just that in love and I hope you will be too."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan but I love this place for their wonderful produce. I have also bought other items that I can't find else where."}
{"text":"I have only been here twice, as it's not very convenient for me to get to. Both times, I had really great experiences. The store itself is not very big, so I can imagine it can get crowded here on the weekends. It was nice to have an escape from the traditional grocery stores to come here. They have a drink bar with coffee and smoothies and juices. They have so many local goodies including TONS of produce, meats, dairy items, and baked goods. Their selection of sprouts was really impressive and they were all so fresh. They have tons of kombucha, including those giant GT bottles- I have never seen them anywhere else but here. This is the perfect spot if you're looking for something in particular, or have a special occasion. I am looking forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I really dig the EEFC, notably for breakfast, which is when I go when I'm in tahn.  This is the real deal - alt culture 70s vibe combined with an unpretentiously modern selection of fine foodstuffs, much of which is vegan-friendly (which is the best kind of friendly)."}
{"text":"I love  the co-op. Generally speaking, for me grocery shopping falls in the same category as cutting my grass and doing my taxes: necessary but unpleasant. But going to the co-op is a different experience than most grocery stores. The co-op serves a broader purpose. I love several things about the EEFC: first the people that work there are friendly, diverse, and caring. Second, the selection is curated to provide options that are more sustainable and nutritious. Third, and most important to me, the atmosphere is unlike more grocery stores; it's pace is a bit slower, it's definitely not a super market (but the selection is still diverse), and it's more relaxed. Fourth, they're cafe is great; I often take my daughter here for breakfast. The only caveat is price: you will generally spend more money here than Giant Eagle, TJs, or Aldi, but the quality and experience is superior."}
{"text":"For a good majority of my time in Pittsburgh I lived in the east end of the city and just now have visited here.  Not sure why it had taken me so long to motivate myself to enter these doors, but it finally happened.  Many of my friends have talked about this place and how great every product is within.  Not sure, but I just didn't believe that at first.    Walking in I was surprised.  It reminded me of the old markets that I grew up with.  A lot of freshness held within with a cozy feel.  While walking the aisles I was seeing items I had no idea existed.  It finally hit me that this might be the place I want to be shopping at due to my long list of allergies.  It was like a light bulb lit up above my head.  While my friend was obtaining the items he needed I went on my way and decided to read the labels of a few items.  I am so happy to have found this oasis in the city.  Big bonus for me, they have Jeni's Splendid ice cream, straight from Columbus, OH."}
{"text":"Ooooppss...update time.   Got the regular (steamed spinach and lasagna) from the hot bar on my way to work.   So, I'm on my dinner break sitting, chatting it up with a co worker while eating.  I see something white in the spinach just before putting it in my mouth.  WTF is that!  OMG, it looks like one of those fat ass worms we'd  pluck from the greens in my grandma's garden.  I threw the fork down and my co worker says...\" you're seeing stuff.\"  Um NOT!  I sat there digging through the spinach determined to find that damn worm.  Thirty minutes later  SHAZAM...found it. Ugh, my coworker spread open the spinach leaf.  EEEkkkk, it was bigger and fatter with black spikes poking out.  FUCK!  Call the manager at Co-op and he says...\"Bring it in for a refund, thanks for being so nice about it...We usually just see worms in the fruits.\"  Geez, thanks for that lil tidbit.    This happened last week around the Sept 14, 2010.  Guess that means it's really organic, huh?"}
{"text":"I was visiting Pittsburgh and looking for a throat spray called Singers Saving Grace. Whole Foods didn't have the item in stock but East End Co-Op did! Also, had a smoothie while a shopped.   What a great find!"}
{"text":"When I go organic I go here and reccommend the same to my clients!  Mark CPT  bestpapersonaltrainercom"}
{"text":"The East End Co-Op is a great location for healthy foods. It's a small market but carries a lot of items from fresh produce, hot foods, fresh grains and spices. If you're vegetarian, vegan or have special diet such as gluten-free, the options here abound. They have a wonderful juice bar as well as a hot bar serving delicious prepared foods including breakfast, lunch and dinner fare. I especially love going there for breakfast. Goods are at a higher price point here, but you're paying for quality products that are locally sourced and GMO-free. This store is a Pittsburgh gem!"}
{"text":"This is a good co-op, with a generous selection for it's smallish size. Prices are better here than in some co-ops I've shopped at. Competitive with the big boxes, as far as I can tell. I have tried some hot-bar/cafe items and quite liked them. The java jolt smoothie is amazing, as is the lemon pepper tofu sandwich!  If you can judge a town by its co-op, which I am prone to do, Pittsburgh proves to be a decent place to be a conscientious vegetarian shopper."}
{"text":"This is sort of a niche place for me. It's a bit too expensive for the average person, I think (and yes i understand that it's a co-op, etc. but it doesn't change that it's probably middle to upper class prices by comparison), but it does offer some deals. It's the best place to buy spices because they're sold in bulk, and if you want to try something new or only need a little for a recipe, you don't have to buy a whole bottle. There is an entire aisle of spices, spice blends and dried herbs, so there is a lot to choose from. It's also great to buy a little at a time because you can make sure your spices are always fresh. Same goes for the bulk food bins, though probably half of them are the 9,000 flavors of granola they stock.  The salad bar has great variety. The hot food bar, not so much. It runs out quickly, and it's too easy to run up a high tab if the good stuff is weighty. I'm not a fan of most of the packaged fresh food in the deli case. The stuffed grape leaves are not good, and a lot of the other things seem sort of bland to me.  There's an extensive vitamins and supplements section, with pretty much any herbal supplement you'd want. The produce section is expensive, but almost always very fresh."}
{"text":"Their selection has gotten better and better over the years. Perfect for vegetarians, vegans, gluten free peeps and health nuts. I've been trying to become vegan and they have an awesome vegan frozen/refrigerated food section with the best fake cheeses and meats ever! Really good produce and bulk foods area. They also have a little cafe section.   The only downside is that it can get pretty pricey and the workers can be really spacey sometimes. Always really nice but slow, slow lines."}
{"text":"This is a good co-op for Pittsburgh, stocking up on local items and friendly staff. However, I was surprised at the teeny tiny amount of fresh food. My normal experience with co-ops includes massive amounts of produce, dairy, baked goods, and meats. Not here though; instead it's like a co-op in miniature. Even the mozzarella I was looking for came only in tiny olive-sized balls. Don't get me wrong - I fully support the existence of a co-op, especially in an area like the East End, but to be honest, I think a trip to the Strip District would be much more productive shopping-wise."}
{"text":"Spices, spices, spices! Best deal in town when you run out of something and don't want to pay $7 for another bottle of parsley at Giant Eagle. I also appreciate the affordable selection of local milk products, eggs, bread (Allegro Hearth, yum!) , and honey. One gripe - salad mix, it's 4.99 a bag! You can get the same salad mix at TJ's for 1.99, 2.99 if you want organic. And currently most of the produce is shipped from other states/countries. I don't know if that will change as summer rolls but more local would be great."}
{"text":"The staff is very helpful if you have questions, are unsure of what exactly you need and they are very knowledgeable! Tea selection is amazing and I love to try their bulk products."}
{"text":"In need of healthy goodness today! Parked right out front. There were a decent amount of patrons but nothing that would make me growl at the person standing in front of the Thai coconut soup I so desperately wanted.   First thing I did was order a wheat grass shot and my favorite juice bar drink...Dante's Inferno! It is a bright red drink that contains organic beets, carrot, celery, ginger, and garlic. I never get it with garlic even though you should. I can't handle that much garlic in a drink. I'm a wuss.   Hot foods was bumpin' but I was still able to stroll around and decide on what Indian Kitchen cookery would go in the belly for dinner. A little tofu surprise, chickpea curry, steamed kale, steamed veggies with big slices of zucchini, and a few red lentil scoops. Everything looked fresh and delicious. After grabbing 2 soups and my dinner I downed my sweet wheat grass shot and was ready to get home. At the register they forgot to ring up the shot but I had to let them know. All smiles as I left. Don't forget to tip the juice bar peeps."}
{"text":"The products and service are great, but the prices are outrageous!  I am on a vegan diet and have found this co-op really helpful. If you can get past the prices, the selection is great!"}
{"text":"Where do I start??  i LOVE the East End Food Co-op!  One of my colleagues introduced me to the co-op and I was super skeptical, but when I went back by myself I was immediately in love.  I originally went the first time to get some essential oils, but left with that and then some! I've been back quite a few times since then and I can't get enough!  I get a little overwhelmed when I go in if I dont have a very specific list (and even then, if you're not familiar with the products or choices, it can be confusing) but I do love to go in and just explore.. It's really a little piece of heaven for any health food lover.  I love their selections of dairy products and meats as well.. theres also a great supplement section.. I could go on and on, but you get it.  This place is a diamond in the rough and I love it!"}
{"text":"Do you want locally grown produce? Preferably organic? Raw milk? Well then the east end co-op might be the place for you. We have to supplement our groceries with trips to whole foods but we definitely prefer the co-op. As members we get some periodic discounts.   Most of the fellows there are really nice too. At some point they were out of one of their on sale items (unbleached organic flour) but they wrote us a rain check so that we could get it at the same price when we came in later."}
{"text":"I've been to the co op several times for the hot foods bar for lunch. I've always enjoyed what I got and especially like their mock tuna. A little disappointed the last couple times they were out. I guess the secret is out. I also like their juice/ smoothie bar.  You can find all your heathy grocery needs here. At lot of the items are cheaper then Whole Foods. They also have lots of local fresh produce.  On this particular visit I tried the mock tuna,  a smoothie, some tofu, vegan dumplings and vegan pad Thai. My coworkers and I did sort of a pot luck. Everything was really good and I'm the farthest thing from a vegan or vegetarian.   They have a little eating area that sometimes gets a little crowded during lunch time. I've heard they have brunch so that's my next visit!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They make the best smoothies. My only complaint is that you can find pretty much everything here less somewhere else. It is pretty expensive."}
{"text":"My first trip to the east end food co op was sort of a disappointment,  I guess I heard so much about it that I sort of made it bigger (in my mind) than it was.  First, it's not bad, for what it is. I like trader Joe's better, I like whole foods better, but this place had stuff I use that the other don't.  Nice produce section, items seemed fresh, and plentiful. Mostly organic, and I do like how they label things \"local\" so that we can help our local farmers, and growers.   Great juice bar, salad bar, and hot lunch items. Everything looked appetizing.  Great spice and herb section, I bought some freshly ground ginger and some wonderful sweet and smoked paprikas.   Good vegan section, tofurkey brands and lightlife products. Good dairy section too, their prices for soy milk is a bit outrageous.  That said, the east end food co op is a good place to shop for the pantry."}
{"text":"I had driven by East End Food Co-Op over 100x throughout the last 3 years and would frequently comment, \"I need to check it out!\" Well, finally, a couple weeks ago, I decided to randomly swing by the co-op.  I was diagnosed with a soy allergy last year, so I was truly like a little kid in a candy store at East End Food Co-Op. There are so many options that not only accommodate my annoying food allergy but also support incredible local businesses.  For my first East End visit, I snagged several items, including incredible locally-made challah bread, three types of flavorful locally-harvested honey, cognac fig cheese, and my favorite amy's pizza in pesto, a flavor that I have never found elsewhere. Thankfully, I was shopping without a basket or cart, or I would have spent well over $100 on my first trip. Instead, I was trying to balance all my great finds in my arms, which limited my purchases.  My one warning about East End... don't expect Aldi or Trader Joe's prices here. Like Whole Foods, you'll be spending $50 or more on just a bad or two of groceries. Just remember that you're supporting multiple local businesses when shopping here, and you'll leave feeling fulfilled about your money spent!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. We recently moved and I still keep the membership tag on my key ring like a love lorn teenager.   We frequented all of the obvious places. Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, the new place near the strip. This place made me feel really good about supporting the community. I loved buying produce  and bulk goods here. Best price on beans and tomatoes. Loved the prepared foods, the salad and hot bars and the cosmetics selection.   The membership is totally worth it."}
{"text":"The East End Food Co-Op is a great place to shop and somewhere I frequent reguarly. They have a full selection of products but add a different local flare to things! I find their produce is always fresh and they have a great selection of organic fruits and vegetables as well.  One of my favorite parts about the East End Food Co-Op is The Co-op Café. They have a variety of soups, entrees and sides to choose from plus a great salad bar. Whether I have time to sit down and enjoy my meal or take it to go they have a little bit of everything and it's all FRESH! This is one of my favorite places to shop!"}
{"text":"Loveee the co op. The place always smells good! Really friendly staff and very helpful with finding anything you need. The prices are extremely reasonable. The store is easy to get to. Parking lot is easy to navigate."}
{"text":"There is nothing like this in chicago!  (that I know of).....I hope I get to stay in Pittsburgh long enough just to take advantage of this co-op.  I love the bulk section, especially since I can choose the quantity of what I want to buy.  Super convenient for travelers.  You can buy pasta, granolla, flour, quinoa, cous cous, cane sugar, spices, YERBA MATE!!!, dried fruit, nuts, olive oil, peanut & almond butter, soap.....man, I could go on & on.  You can buy all of that stuff & choose how much you want of it.    I was suprised that they had cacao powder, for such a small place.  They have a nice little section of tofu, tempeh, & seitan next to a bunch of vegan cheese that looked really good.    They also have a juice bar & vegetarian \"cafe.\"  I don't think I'd call it a cafe, more like buffet.  I wasn't all that impressed with the food they had cooked, but I'm not going to penalize them for that.  For such a small place it's pretty amazing what they already have going on there.  I really want to try something from their juice bar too!!    There must be someone dj'ing the music in the store because I heard some great music that you wouldn't hear on the radio.  Everyone was very curteous and nice.  I should try to make friends with these people since I'm new in town."}
{"text":"So my man and i go in here after work one day because we consume mass quantities of brown basmati and almond butter.   I am used to the co-ops in Detroit,  the overall demeanor of the patrons and the staff.   I felt looked down upon and judged in this place.   So much so that i just got my stuff and got the heck outta there.   I didn't bother to look around much bc i won't be back.   Prices on what we bought were fine and the quality of what we bought was fine.   The actual lady who rung us up was fine.   Virtually every other person in the place looked me up and down and made a face.  I dont know if they didn't approve of my dress or my shoes or my face or my hair but i felt horrible in there.  I am beginning to think that I don't really fit in to PGH."}
{"text":"The husband and I get so excited each week for grocery shopping because of the co-op. I love it so much.  We need this place in our lives. It gives us hope and makes us feel like we belong. I have never, in my entire life, eaten better broccoli. I sometimes obsess about this broccoli and go through withdraws when we run out. The beet hummus is to die for and the wraps are incredible. I also like the beauty section and natural makeup and night creams.   Yes, some stuff can be pricer that Trader Joes's, like the Amy's frozen pizzas, but it is so worth it becasue you know that the extra $ is going towards a good cause.  We got a membership last year and rarely go anywhere else.  And our dog attacks his bowl when we feed him his food. He won't even go near anything else, which we sometimes have to resort to when he runs out."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian, my boyfriend is not. He does not understand the joy in walking into a sincerely veg-friendly place, but I do and this definitely is. East End Food Co-Op is totally cool. It's little and I don't think I could do a \"full\" shopping trip here, but it's somewhere you feel good going to. The produce is undeniably fresh (though expensive!) and their prepared foods section is GREAT. I had a curry tofu salad and basanji (I might have just butchered the spelling of that, oops!) that were top notch. There's a salad bar, a smoothie/juice bar, a bulk foods section... Life is good here! If I was raking in more moolah, I would shop here more frequently, but Trader Joe's prices are a little bit more reasonable (and the food there is a little bit more \"mainstream\" for my significant other). This is a cool place to peruse when you have a little bit of time to explore-- it's worth the poke..."}
{"text":"This was a really interesting adventure.   Initially, I wasn't too impressed with the produce section where it was pretty limited and only some of the fruits were worth buying. The self serve section was enormous and definitely worth checking out! There are a few things here that you may not find anywhere else.   My interest in the food there was a little curbed by the prices which you could easily beat at  a regular grocery store. However, the raw milk and goat milk there was an interesting find though!   It's a bit out of the way but if I'm ever near bakery square I would definitely drop by!"}
{"text":"The best grocery store I've been to. Lots of organic fruit and veggies, bulk bins for as far as the eye can see, and if you can't find a type of granola you like then you should give up on granola.  They basically have everything you need, and you don't have to shop at the chain stores."}
{"text":"I love a good grocery store and this one is wonderful. The cafe has plenty of options (all vegetarian!). I sampled some of their hot offerings - the soup, quiche, vegetable preparations. Everything was fresh. The coffee was good as well.  Note: Bought some farm fresh fertile eggs here and they were the best eggs I've tasted in a long time!"}
{"text":"I really liked the mission behind this place; locally sourced, organic, that sort of thing. However the staff was less than helpful and the prices are ridiculous!"}
{"text":"On our way back from DC to Chicago yesterday, we stopped off here since my friend swore by it. One of the best co-ops I have ever been to. They have such a huge selection of products. If you are looking for vegan cheese, this place has a humongous selection including Sheese, which my bud says is really hard to find. They carry my beloved Temptations soy ice cream even in chocolate chip cookie dough. Nummers! I grabbed delicious produce, a spinach and feta & olives-zaatar pie made by Najat's Cuisine, a STILL WARM ginger cookie made there, a raspberry ginger beer, and I'm sure I am forgetting something. I would come here all the time if I lived in Pittsburgh. Their hot food looked good, but I wanted something to grab and go.  Funny thing, in the time that we were there, three people commented that they really liked my tattoos. Then the cashier said he liked my Obama button. I love this place!"}
{"text":"This is a great stop for fresh everything! I crave their juice on a regular basis. Shot of kale, YES! The salad bar and hot foods bar are also great, hot foods change on a regular basis but always have vegan/veg options. Aside from a quick dinner/grocery shopping location, we tried their weekend brunch. My bf loved everything, and the prices were great for a full plate of food. I, myself devoured some vegan pumpkin bread and a delicious fair-trade coffee. I also love their to-go foods selection, full of vegan-friendly wraps, salads and more - great for picnics! The staff is very friendly and it's obvious they like their jobs. The bulk foods and produce sections are also impressive! I wish it was closer, but it's worth the commute!"}
{"text":"I've been a member of a Coop since adulthood (long time...) and have been a member of Food Coops in Seattle, San Francisco, Ukiah, Eureka, Olympia, Portland.... I've been a member of this Coop for 9 year now and I've about had it. The Board management of this place is absolutely incompetent. A recent election was just botched to the point where they threw out votes. Why does this matter? It matters because they provide direction and governance to the management team. If the Board is bumbling about there is an impact on all operations. I have found this to be the case with the 10 year plus talk about a second location or major improvements to current location. The latter btw is impossible due to other tenant issues. So, MOVE. Instead years of inaction and lip service. Deliveries are tough and parking tougher. Considering that 90% of visits are by car this is a problem. Produce is often in poor condition or simply just not there. At my last visit a few weeks ago they were out of bottled spring water (common) and mac and cheese boxes...think about that...mac and cheese...water. Not watercress - water. So, I am keep my membership out of principle, but my consumer dollars will be going elsewhere and hoping for change. With that said, after a decade of waiting....I think it's time to have an amicable separation. Consider my $100 membership alimony."}
{"text":"East End Food Co-op is awesome!  If I had to choose between the Co-op and WF, the Co-op is where it's at.  There is a good selection of fruits and veggies, as well as toiletries (shampoos, soaps, toothpaste, tampons, shaving creams, etc.) to household cleaning products. The frozen section is also very diverse with a good selection of frozen meals, ice cream (dairy and nondairy), and veggies. The Co-op also carries a nice selection of foods for people with restricted diets especially for Celiac and vegans, or for people with severe allergies like myself.   They also carry hard to find vegan cheeses such as Treeline that I have difficulty finding at WF in Pittsburgh and the Co-op in West Virginia. I was also happy to find that they had my favorite Ito-En sencha green tea shot (it's just green tea in a can, it's not like one of those energy shots at all).   The deli is also fantastic, and I highly recommend the Co-op deli over the WF deli. There are a wide variety of soups and salads and dressings. The vegan mushroom soup is really, really, really yummy. There are also vegan meals in ready to go containers (salads, vegan pesto noodle salad, etc.). You can also order coffee/espresso at the deli counter. As with any good Co-op, they have a variety of non-dairy milk options.   If you have food allergies or have any dietary restrictions the Co-op is an excellent place to get a quick meal (hot or cold) and to pick up groceries. There is also a little dining/sitting area at the front of the store. It's kid friendly and they even have a little compost/recycling bin! Yes, this is important for me to mention because I come from Seattle where recycling is the norm and we get fined if we don't recycle..and recycling does not seem to be a big thing in WV where I currently live.   There is also a community board if you are looking to post something up (events, classes, pet sitting, etc.) near the bathroom in the back of the store."}
{"text":"As soon as I walk into the store I grab a sales ad and the informational magazine. I love the recipes and the beneficial health articles.   I love coming here, they have a great selection of bulk items.  It's more affordable for me because I benefit from getting what I need of an item rather than being forced to get more than I need and end up wasting food and money.  Therefore I love getting the necessary quantities of spices, teas, nuts, flours, etc.   The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the products.  On my next visit I might stop my the cafe and try something."}
{"text":"Stopped by here on my drive across country to stock up on some tasty, healthy snacks. Nice selection of bulk foods. If I lived in Pittsburgh, this is where I would shop all the time."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and wish there had been something similar in Orlando (one where you don't have to be a member).  I randomly found out about East End when I was doing a search for organic, local food products. We decided to go check it out and instantly fell in love. Their produce selection is second-to-none, seriously. And yes, I am including Giant Eagle in that!  Seriously, just about every time we've gone all the produce looks so fresh and brightly colored (i.e., the peppers, tomatoes, fruits, etc.) and ripe. I also like how they carry pasta noodles, rice, and other fun things in bulk. We always lament about how since there's only the two of us, we don't always need the large offerings that you usually find at places like Giant Eagle. Being able to pick out just the amount you need and not letting anything go to waste makes me feel a lot better.  Beyond the food products, I have also gotten into making my own body washes. East End carries all of the ingredients that I need with multiple options. They have recently redone their store (and are still renovating) and have expanded their meat (they didn't use to carry meat at all) and cheese selections tremendously. The meat is a little pricey, actually the whole store is little pricey, but in my opinion it is well worth it. It's nice knowing that the items are organic and come from sustainable farms. Bonus: they buy as much locally produced items as they can as well.   I really have nothing bad to say about them. The service has always been great and I love the selections and products offered. I can't comment on the cafe as I haven't eaten at it, but I hear the food is great. A combination of East End and the Strip has pretty much replaced Giant Eagle for me. I only stop by there now if I'm close by and just need a few items really quick."}
{"text":"Great shopping experience! Sustainable and PLENTY of organic, healthy, vegan options. Such a valuable resource for me as my dog and I road trip cross country. I'll happily be back when in Pittsburgh next. Thank you all SO MUCH"}
{"text":"I love supporting co-ops and other local grocers, but for whatever reason, I kept putting off visiting East End Food Co-op. This all changed yesterday when I was desperate for a healthy smoothie and nowhere near one.   We were a little confused as to how to get into the co-op, because didn't realize that it was on the opposite street all tucked away. After we figured that out by following another patron, we were really excited to walk through the doors.   If you've never been into a co-op, you should know that they are typically smooshed together and have an interesting smell that emanates from the bulk-spices isle. I love this smell. It's really the best grocery store smell, EVER.  Proceeding through the store we noticed the colorful and abundant produce section. So many beautiful fruits, veggies and herbs. The prices varied, but they were probably on par with what you would pay for any other organic produce somewhere else.   When we found the back area with hot foods, cold foods and the smoothies...I died of happiness. There were so many wonderful things back there. The food bar is $7.99 a pound, which is a lot cheaper than some places! The smoothies were all very tasty sounding, but I settled on a smoothie with soy ice cream, strawberries and papaya juice. Oh, my, god. It was so delicious! My boyfriend got the King smoothie, and he really enjoyed his too.  Right beside the smoothie bar there is a section for all kinds of books. My eye was caught by an organic and local homebrewing book. It is now on my list of must haves!   The rest of the store was great. I especially love the cheese selection (we bought AMAZING and LOCAL tomato-basil havarti), the vegan meat products and the prices.   I'll definitely be coming here a lot more. It's a great little co-op, and it is definitely the best I have been in!"}
{"text":"Coffee, dry beans, bulk foods, fresh fruits, and veggies oh my.  Once a staple place of mine when living in Friendship and Point Breeze, now a novelty that strikes up fond memories.  Even now that I live in the North Hills I still enjoy to seek out the East End Food Co-op on a semi-regular basis.  I go there for the bulk bins mainly, but always end up grabbing some other things.  Their fresh fruit and vegetable selection is always good and cheaper than Whole Foods and Market District for sure.  I am a gigantic fan of their whole coffee bean selection as well.  Very good place.  And not swarming with hippies all the time, though that's not that bad of a thing."}
{"text":"Well...as per usual I'm writing this as a Vegan so I like to put that out there firstly.   Best selling features:   #1 - water prices are the best in the city and on par with Whole Foods #2 - vegan fake meat options are plentiful #3 - staff are friendly #4 - while the lot parking is a nightmare on a good day...there is usually always street parking relatively close #5 - there is an in-store eatery...(which is kind of unravelling from vegan/veg...so that's kind of sad)  Lots of products from self care to household items to staples...produce section is a little small but carries the basics and then some. Bulk section is nice."}
{"text":"A great food coop that specializes in local, organic and sustainably harvested food and other items.  The store is a little small but comfortable.  The store also hosts special events and is community supported.  Become a member by buying a share and voting on board members.  %10 discount with membership.  The coop is also regularly involved in community events year round and advocates sustainable and earth friendly practices."}
{"text":"Best tasting salad bar in a long time. Worth every penny. Been going there since 2006 and wished i lived closer. I need to go back soon. Try the hot meals or some of the delish produce, organic meats , spices and et al! Jamison garms lamb and raw milk need i say more."}
{"text":"A lesser known Whole Foods type of market with its own charm.   This place is pretty cool. There is so much to see and consider buying and I was intrigued at every corner. Listen to the reviews! Their selection of veggies, meats, fruits, frozen items, nuts and pretty much everything is amazing. You'll have so much fun exploring even if you're not looking to really buy anything. Boyfriend got dried mangoes and almond butter. A bit pricey, but we expected it to be. I got some food from the hot food and salad bars. They are small; you might find something you like. (Their mac n cheese is good!) They also have a juice bar, which I'd love to try next time.   East End Food Co-Op is an excellent place to do your weekly grocery shopping. You can find everything you need here and more."}
{"text":"This place has steadily improved over the years, and never fails to make me happy.    It's stocked with every variety of weird hippie food.  It's also stocked with the best produce anywhere in the city in the winter months when Giant Eagle's selection looks beat up.  The prepared foods case in the back is deliciously weird.  And it's locally owned/operated, so you're not exactly sending your hard earned money to Whole Food's CEO.  The membership is lifetime, apparently, which the employees always kind of failed to express; I thought you had to pay for it yearly, and the difference is pretty big.   That said, I live far enough away that getting here regularly still doesn't justify the membership."}
{"text":"Love the East End Food Co op .  Reasonably priced organic selections.  The smoothie/juice bar is outstanding.  Great vegan/and or healthy selections at the hot and cold salad bar.  My most favorite thing here is the ability to purchase raw, unpasteurized unhomogenized milk.     The staff is very friendly, the. produce is very fresh.  This is definitely a good way to avoid the over priced, over processed major grocery chain food selection.  I love the co op."}
{"text":"I really love this little place. The hot bar is almost always completely wonderful. I especially love the breakfast/brunch on weekends, it's one of my favorite meals. The potatoes and garbanzo bean patties are amazing.  The prices are pretty much in line with any smaller heath and local food oriented grocer. I can usually count on them to have specific items that Whole Foods is sold out of and sometimes at a better price. Plus, the Co-op hot bar is a million times better than the Whole Foods hot bar - quality over quantity all the way.  Short lines, great staff, good for Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"When I started looking for housing in Pittsburgh I was obsessed with living near Trader Joes.  I was so psyched there even was one in Pittsburgh.   Then the other day I wandered into East End (which is actually closer to my new apartment) and see I needn't have worried.  When I first heard the name, I imagined East End would be a dusty, incensey-smelling place full of turnips, staffed by people clothed in Birkenstocks and clothing made entirely out of scarves.  I could not have been more wrong.  East End blows away any Trader Joe's, Whole Foods or any other health food/grocery store I have ever seen. It is extremely well-stocked with amazing produce and food that makes me literally *want* to eat healthy and, heck, even to exercise (so I can eat more of their good ingredients).  And the stuff seems to be sold at normal (not Whole Paycheck) prices.  My favorite part was at the back there was a salad and hot food bar.  I tried this spicy sausage soup (made with ToFurkey Italian Sausages).  It was AMAZING!  I cannot wait to make it for my extremely non-vegetarian parents and not tell them I used vegan sausages!"}
{"text":"I have lived close by to the co-op for a little over a year, and I do the majority of my grocery shopping here (probably about 80%--I also shop at Aldi, Trader Joe's, and Whole Foods periodically; they all have their assets).   Probably the co-op's greatest assets are its local produce and friendly environment. First, while the produce can be expensive (usually for good reason considering the quality and origins of the produce), some produce is very well-priced. For example, there are bins of local mushrooms that you buy by the pound; if you compare those prices per pound to the pre-packaged containers at other grocery stores, it's an incredible deal. I also tend to shop the produce on sale; there's usually always something. Sometimes the deals are downright crazy (e.g. $1.25 for a pink of organic blackberries or $1 for a bag of onions). Second, all of the co-op employees I've interacted with have been very friendly and helpful. In general, the store has a friendly vibe. Even on weekends, I've never found the co-op to be as overwhelming as other grocery stores.   As others have said, the bulk items are unique and useful. There are also good deals to be had there. I also enjoy the bakery items; I don't have any dietary restrictions, but they certainly aim to cater to those with specialized diets (e.g. gluten free, vegan, nut allergies).   As for drawbacks, I find them pretty minimal. The parking lot can get crowded, but again, I don't think it's worse than any other grocery stores in the area. I also tend to avoid buying some pantry staples (e.g. vinegar) and snacks (e.g. chips, crackers) here because the same quality can be found cheaper at other places. I'm used to going to different stores for different needs though, so this is not a big deal for me."}
{"text":"Really wide selection of products to choose from.  I understand that organic, local stuff is a premium purchase over conventional foods, and there is a huge community for these types of things to support the local food scene...But damned if I'm going to pay $8 for a pound of strawberries when I can get them for sale at Kroger for $1. Everything is 2-4x more expensive than conventional groceries. I can understand paying a little more, but I can't do that kind of mark-up."}
{"text":"There are two main sets of reasons for liking Co-ops in general and the East End Food Co-op in particular.  The first is instrumental--price, quality, wide selection, location, etc. The second has to do with your values. If you don't like agribusiness and greedy corporations, Co-operative shopping is a great alternative that works. Our Co-op, which I joined decades ago, is the crown jewel of Pittsburgh's progressive community.      Some items cost more. One reason among many is that our employees are paid a living wage. A guaranteed way to bring prices down is to do more of your shopping at the Co-op. This will bring about growth and consequent economies of scale.   https://www.yelp.com/biz/east-end-food-co-op-pittsburgh"}
{"text":"One of the things I miss since moving to Bloomfield from Regent Square is being within walking distance to the Co-Op. It's the perfect neighborhood market and though on the smaller side they carry just about anything you need. Love the food bar and freshly made beverages. All natural all good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this market!  The selection of vegan and vegetarian foods is overwhelming. I love the area with all the bulk foods, it's a great place to pick up beans, flour, peanut butter, granola, anything! You can even get spices in bulk!   The hot food area looks great! I've never tried anything from there but their vegetarian selection is great.  My favorite area is the refrigerated area. I love the selection of vegan cheese, dressings and meats. When I was last here, I picked up daiya mozzarella, daiya peach yogurt, kite hill almond milk yogurt, sweet earth seitan bacon, a Hail Mary chocolate almond butter tart and some Miyoko double cream garlic herb cheese. What an amazing variety!  Definitely come here for your vegan/vegetarian food needs!"}
{"text":"this is one of the best health food stores i've ever shopped at. the prices overall are pretty good in terms of the size and type of the store. plus there are regularly sales which help make the prices easier to swallow. the bulk and pre-made food sections are really wonderful, and there is always a good selection of local produce.   the staff is knowledgeable and very friendly and they give a 10cent coupon for bringing your own bags."}
{"text":"Forget Whole Foods when you have East End Cooperative! Honestly, this is quite possibly one of my favorite coops. They make some amazing deli items...so amazing that I went back twice during my visit to PA. I was only expecting to have a few options in the prepared food section, but the vegan options were plentiful. Their mock tuna salad was impressive, made with tvp, vegenaise, and spices. The potato salad was creamy and exceptionally delicious. And the vegan pasta salad was also impressive. Generally most grocers fail in this department, but East End excels by leaps and bounds. I can't believe how tasty their store-made food was. The prices were also very reasonable, if not low. If I lived in PA, I'd join their coop and would go there frequently."}
{"text":"You gotta love co-ops. Especially this one! It embraces its east end neighborhood, makes amazing products available to the community, and in general feels like it cares, which is the only acceptable vibe for anything calling itself a cooperative! I mostly go here for the juices, honestly, but I'll tell you why: EEFC is literally the only place in Pittsburgh proper to get your hands on some straight, non-pastuerized juicer juice. Why is this not a thing here?! Even the Whole Foods is lacking a juice bar!! Seems juice is the new Pittsburgh Mexican food. Sheesh!"}
