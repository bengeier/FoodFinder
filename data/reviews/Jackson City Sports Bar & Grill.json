{"text":"Have been twice; won't go again.  The servers seem friendly enough, but sometimes go awol for long periods of time.  The miniscule size/length of their skirts and shirts make me think that this isn't really a place that wants families anyway.  As for the food, their specialty chicken burger was a disappointment.  The texture was mushy and the flavour uninspired.  Couldn't finish.  One of our kids ordered chocolate milk, which took a long time to arrive.  When we asked, they said they were having trouble finding it.  What they eventually brought out was awful.  We asked for white milk instead, and that took a long time to come out as well.  When it did, it was also awful.  They assured us it was just normal milk, but it definitely wasn't.  We suspect they were using powdered milk."}
{"text":"This is the only place in the Yonge and Sheppard area that you can get a table when all of the way better bars in the area are full.  My group of 5 came here on Saturday night to watch the Leaf game, we were charged $5 cover (because it was UFC) but had to pay $20 a head because \"people just come here to nurse beers\" after some douche bag (probably the owner or related to the owner) saw us walk up and let security know \"hey dude - you better charge these guys\" I'm sure a group of late 20's white people SCREAMS ordering a beer and just sitting there - when we told them we were coming for food and drinks. We paid the $20 - got $15 back per person on our bill. The whole concept isn't awful, I understand the bar needs to make money, but we were treated like crap.  Service is crap - they obviously picked pretty over brains (even though the girls weren't Moxies-grade pretty). Aloof servers just walking in circles, no customer service...I was under the impression that this place was a chain but it's clear that It's not - the lack of customer service indicates it's some rich young kid opening a bar with too much money and no experience.  Some of the food we got was ok, some of it was cold and obviously sat there. I'd hate to see what disaray the kitchen was in. We paid our bill and left. If it wasn't for that jerk in the beginning I'd say MAYBE I'd come back (if the rest of the good bars are packed) but I live right accross the street - I'll order pizza and get some beer at home next time.   Sorry, but this place sucks. They really need to work on customer retention - go all bar rescue on them. I won't be back - hopefully they go under soon and Shoeless Joe's comes back! Or a chain that actually has some quality control!"}
{"text":"This clearly amazing bar has been run into the ground by it's amazing management. It languished far longer than it should have before it closed it's doors but I'm glad it's finally gone."}
{"text":"This is the worst bar i have ever been to...heres why -disgusting food -slow service,  -rude servers,   so bad.. Save your money just go down to st.louis down the street this place needs work -dirty washroom,  -very very bad selection of liquors in bar,  -no value in the food you are buying.  -there is no parking, (they lie saying they do then when u get there u pay $5) - music that turns off and on"}
{"text":"Originally, I've come here before because its nearby. I had hands down the worst whiskey sour ever (cheap acidic lime juice with a shot of whiskey, tasted watery with a rotting lime I didn't notice til after I consumed it (yikes) and a maraschino cherry.   In terms of service, the owner of the place treats the waitresses and an elderly paying customer extremely poorly in what seems borderline abusive, a manner that is not particularly professional. Double yikes.   For that reason, I believe that's probably why their service sucks. I came back again because I really have a thing for burgers, and when my friend came back to me describing how delicious this burger was, I had to try it.   Like the others said, make sure your waitress knows you're there. We waited 10 minutes for menus, got up and asked her for one, then waited another 15 minutes to place an order, but again, had to go to her to place the order. There were about four people in the place (minus myself and my friend) and two waitresses. Triple yikes.   The food came within fifteen minutes and was good. I ordered a bacon double cheeseburger, but for some reason, it didn't have bacon. My waitress told me it was cooked into the burger, which I wasn't sure was bullshit or truth (Triple and a half yikes.) Either way, the toppings were nice and crisp, the bun was soft and the burger tasted a little too dry/rough, but it was still decent.   Pros: food's ok, good location, good atmosphere, beer's cheap, people there are friendly.   Cons: management sucks and service is really slow for what seems like no reason whatsoever."}
{"text":"Haha so I walked passed by this place last night on the way to grab a bite from Subway. There was a notice up on their door that the place was closed/locked down since they did not pay their rent and also mentioned some legal issues with the owner. I would have taken a pic but it was raining hard.  I used to come here pretty often since it opened and had no complaints, but a few weeks ago my fiance had a disagreement with one of the waitresses (who was clearly an airhead) so we agreed not to go there ever again. Looks like the place got was it deserved."}
{"text":"Wandering around the Willowdale area one Friday night my boyfriend and I decided to check out Jackson City - we had passed by it countless times but never had the chance to check it out.  Jackson City has a typical sports bar/restaurant set up - though there are TVs in every single individual booth which you don't see in all sports bars and I thought that was quite neat.  Our server, while she seemed a bit scattered, was super sweet and friendly. We found the customer service to be exceptional.  The food was a bit of a mixed bag for us, we had:  Deep Fried Pickles: My favvvourite bar/pub food. These, sadly, weren't cooked enough and were soggy and the breading was falling off. It came with a bacon onion dip that we found a bit heavy.  Bacon Cheeseburger: Dry. Medicore.  Honey BBQ Wings: Wowww. These were the saving grace of the meal. These are some kick ass wings. Nice and crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and the honey bbq sauce was flavourful, and they weren't stingy with it at all. I'd come back and grab some of these babies for take out, for sure. There was also a deal going on where if you ordered a pound of wings, you'd get an extra half pound for free - score!  I had a banana popsicle martini and it was strong, well prepared and delicious. Nice if you're looking for something fruity. They also have some good drink specials throughout the week.  The other clientele was... interesting? To say the least? A weird mix of some old cougars hanging out with young people, and just some general drunks. Not really my crowd, so I think would probably deter me from coming back going forward."}
