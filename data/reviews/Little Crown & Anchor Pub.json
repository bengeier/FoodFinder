{"text":"The bartender Sami is the worst! She profiled me as soon as I walked in the door and treated me like a piece of trash.She was talking with her friends by the dart board, while my food was getting colder and colder and colder under the heat lamp. The cook kept ringing the bell and she didn't care. Guess she better that everyone else. Watch out for the video poker $20 MAX promo. Its a trick. The lazy bartender made me put my entire $20 in the machine even after winning. This whole place is one big JOKE!!! Oh I forgot, your fish and chips SUCK!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Great service. Hard to find good fish and chips in Vegas but this was decent. Cottage pie was amazing though."}
{"text":"Bartender mocked me for asking if they carried The Trooper which they USED to carry 2yrs ago."}
{"text":"A friend of mine were going to watch champions league soccer. When i stepped in, it had a great english atmosphere.  The female bartender was very nice and pleasant.  I was shocked at the lack of TVs and not having all TVs on a Champions league game , as i arrived at 11am , when games start at 1045. I was shocked that a so called english pub would not be prepared to have every TV not airing   When i say this , i say the following 100% truthfully. I never in 5 years have had extreme gas and diarrea eating at any establishment, let alone my EDR at work.   I ordered the burger and it took time to prepare as it took sone time for another patrons food. Hence im thinking this is the care cooks took in preparing food.  Within 15 minutes of finishing my meal i had to use the restroom and extreme runny diarrea . My friend even asked if i was ok.  I left and on the way home i had to pull over and again had extreme diarrea. As this lasted through the night.  UPDATE , my gas has subsided and it no longer causes me to run to bathroom   Overall the experience sucked , except for the ambiance and waitress, who i might add did not thank for the tip.   I would like a response from the general manager explaining why food was served that caused extreme diarrea and gas, as i never had this in 45 years let alone 5 years in vegas."}
{"text":"This place sort of took me by surprise. Wasn't expecting much but when I got there saturday night, it was packed. The pretty bartenders was very nice and the beers were ice cold. It seems like a british pub atmosphere, had darts, and everyone was having a good time. The sausage roll was pretty good, and the pie was also delish. I drank the pear cider and it was just the way I like my drinks. ^^"}
{"text":"Yes, It's much smaller than the other location on Trop. But there's nothing small about the beer selection! They have all the old British faves on tap and I'm pretty sure they'll have whatever you request.    It's a interesting bar in an interesting location. The bar is like an island that is surrounded by a whole bunch of Asian food joints, i.e. the same plaza has a Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean food eateries. So it's kinda of odd to find a bar like this in this location. So be it! Good times to be had!    Can't really say much about the food, since I didn't eat anything! So I'll have to see if they have decent bangers, chips, and mash on a later review.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"After falling in love with the original Crown and Anchor I was excited to try the Little version.  I knew I was playing with fire since this location is on my way home from work and I could potentially wind up here more often than I would like.  But I guess luckily for me, the Little Anchor isn't as fun as its big brother.  It has a similar British/nautical theme as the original location, but it's not as dark and moody.  The bartenders are a little slower and the clientele a little clique-ier.  The bar was covered in food crumbs like it hadn't been cleaned in days.  We ordered onion rings and they were just awful.  I don't know how the breading managed to soak up 13 gallons of oil, but it did.  I took a bite and that was enough for me.  Basically, it's fine to stop at and grab a pint after work but I'd rather make the drive over to the original location if I want anything more than that.  Nikki Jo's Ladies Restroom Review: They're fine.  Be sure to check out the interesting bachelor party advertisement on the door."}
{"text":"How is this the best fish and chips in town? It was like a government meal with dehydrated peas. My coke was flat. And an old man sat right next to me and lit up a cigarette....that didn't help any. The bartender was sweet, that's about it."}
{"text":"Love this place, small and awesome. Best burger in Vegas, in my opinion. Also the staff is awesome, friendly and kind. Customer service is great. Also one of the only places to go to watch soccer in the city of Las Vegas. Gets a little crazy and completely packed for big games, but great to watch games and hang out! Highly recommend! Plus they have a great beer selection."}
{"text":"BEST EVER fried cod fish and chips in Las Vegas! The tartar sauce is homemade and to die for! Light crispy batter on the fresh cod and not one drop of grease on the plate. I'm really impressed! Monday nights is all you can eat fish and chips ( not buffet style - made to order) for 14.99 which is a steal! There are about 10 different beers on tap, perfect temp with the right amount of head- Went on a Sunday, the bartender Christine ( from Brooklyn)....lol....is awesome, friendly, explained the taste and region each beer on tap is from and allowed me to sample a few until I found just the right one. And I'll be back for more! The bar itself is quaint, cool, a couple dart boards and we'll worth the trip which is so close Decatur and Spring Mountain.  This would be a cool place to hang out on Sunday afternoons and watch football games with friends!"}
{"text":"The review is based solely on the horrible attitude of rude bartender name SAMMY B ...from the beginning till end she had attitude towards me .I was there for happy hour and was charged 12 dollars for 2 draft beers-when I politely asked is it happy hour she snapped at me as if I asked her something insulting....I mean come on simple question be kind to answer nicely and graciously after all ...even though  I still tip her(she did not deserve a single penny) and politely said goodbye I was very upset. however next day I went back to talk to manager.  he was not in but 2 other employees Sara and other gentleman made me welcome and treated me with utmost respect and hearing my complaint completely understood. thank you Sara and other guy. people like you should work in hospitality environment ."}
{"text":"love going here to shoot darts, real steel not those silly plastic things. the bartenders are great, and the beer selection is excellent.  It seems silly not to order the fish 'n' chips everytime we go in but the shepperds pie and the english burger are both really good too."}
{"text":"I believe Toby Keith sums this nice place up in this song... \"I love this bar!\" I enjoys self here. A place where you are welcomed and you are ensured a good time. The Toby Keith song pretty much sums it up.. At least for me!!! You all make your own opinion! :)"}
{"text":"This is a wierd place. A bastardised Vegas version of a British theme Pub. Everything is half British and half American.    They offer a decent range of UK Draught and Bottled beers, but the food is pure USA (apart from a few little touches like Heinz beans as a side order.    English football is shown regularly on the TV."}
{"text":"Waited and waited to be served. She took our drink order and it took about half an hour. Waited longer for food. It was not even busy (I  can see why). The fish was overcooked and chips soggy, wine seemed cheap and/or watered down. She obviously let the order sit. No hurry to return here. It's a shame. We used to love it here. Anyway, if you like long waits, overcooked food, rude staff and generally bad service, go here. They're oblivious to wanting to provide good food and hospitality."}
{"text":"The food is still as good as the one on Tropicana but the vibe sucks. It was just a bunch locals who must have came from dotties and starting gambling there. What set me off the roof that made sure I won't go to this location is that they were playing horrible country music. I wanted to go to a English pub not a white trash bar"}
{"text":"It's a low key authentic English pub that's nestled in the middle of Chinatown, where the staff can cheer you up (or the video poker machines) if you had a long day at work, especially Christine, she's one of a kind!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish and chips. Yummy. You are not to have hard liquor at the bar due to a weird liquor license. The gaming machines are alright. It has an old feel to it because of all the wood. I like this place because of the fish and chips not much more. Other than that ...its just the same old pub."}
{"text":"Cute, tiny little pub in Chinatown.  I stopped by to catch the Arsenal/Bayern Munich soccer game.  Surprisingly, there were actually more Bayern fans than Arsenal fans.  At least three guys were drinking tea...I'll stick to beer, I guess.  Chatted with some very nice people and watched most of the Bayern beatdown.  Also had a Stilton plate, which was solid.  The other food coming out of the kitchen looked good.  Pints of Guinness were $7, which seems kind of steep given the location.  It's a good place to catch a soccer game."}
{"text":"After eating some pomegranate frozen yogurt , i was driving around spring mountain and decatur looking for a new restaurant that an acquaintance of my GF mentioned was open ( little fat sheep or fat lil sheep ...mongolian hotpot ) i couldn't find the frickin' place ..a little frustrated so i decided to hit the crown & anchor for a beer ...or 2...  much smaller then the trop location ... sat at the bar ...put a few $$$ in a poker machine ...asked for an ice cold harp ...nice, pint sized brew ...the bartender ( very attractive ...never had anyone that hot workin for me when i owned the bars ...probably a good thing )  asked if i was hungry since monday is all you can eat fish n chips ...i had no intentions of telling her i just had a frozen yogurt ...probably woulda got my ass kicked ! told her no thanks - after about `10 minutes of playing ( winning ...cool ) another cold harp on tap before i even asked ...sweet ...and ... a sample plate of fish n chips ...on the house ...of course i had to try .... good...very good....so i walked out $50 richer ...even after a $30 tip ... all good !!!"}
{"text":"Cider, beers And English pub food, can't drink liquor at the bar though, some weird licensing quirk, but otherwise cool bar. strange to find this place right next to Chinatown but hey I will take pear cider anywhere.   Bar is a little small, parking is easy.   been here three times, all the bartenders are cool."}
{"text":"The cook was late, but Christine's pleasantness made up for it.  If/when I go there again, she'll be 1/2 the reason."}
{"text":"Great place for fish and chips. Brings back memories of London. Staff are amazing!  Great beers from the mothership."}
{"text":"The food is awesome just make sure you let them know how you want yours prepared, Mondays are you can eat fish . I usually come for graveyard for the burgers half off and fish. The kitchen is open 24 hours"}
{"text":"I ventured into this very unknown bar in the middle of China town. It was very much like being in Hong Kong, the former British Colony, and I loved it.   I had a Jameson..  it tasted.. well like it should.. and the .. Egg wrapped in Bacon to start.. what a crazy combo that I love! Very good..  I cant remember the name.. but its one of the few apps on the menu.   Then I ordered the french dip and the Gf ordered the Steak and Mushroom Pie.. French dip was average.. but the pie was amazing. I will be back!"}
{"text":"THIS BAR ILLEGALLY CHARGES EXTRA AMOUNTS ON YOUR RECEIPT.   Total ACTUAL food and beverage charges on receipt (with tax) added up manually: $114.05 Total amount listed on bottom of bill: $124.05  A group of us went in on Saturday for trivia night. We had a voucher for $50 that we won a few weekends ago. They cannot split the voucher, so we were dividing the check out to apply the voucher ourselves. When doing this, we noticed the total on the bill was $10 higher than the total we got when manually adding up bill. When we brought it to our waitress' attention, she brought the receipt to the back. When she came back she let us know it was because of tax. We told her that didn't make sense because the restaurant tax was listed on the bill and liquor tax is included in the drink price... and it still wasn't adding up. She then called the bartender over (who claimed to be the manager). She sat down with an attitude from the beginning. First she said it was a true blue system and there was absolutely no way it was wrong. We asked her to add it up herself and see. She got the same total we did (not the total on the bill). Then, she tried to tell us it was the tax again. She got EXTREMELY rude when she figured out that she was wrong. THEN she told us we are getting $50 off because of a voucher we won (fair and square), and that we shouldn't even be worried about the $10. We told her we understood that, but the voucher is $50 voucher, not a $40 voucher, and their system cannot just add a random amounts to the total on the bill.  She yelled at us and told us we were no longer allowed to use vouchers at this restaurant (because that's obviously fair.....) In the end, our waitress (not the \"manager\" dealing with the situation) came back over and told us it was a glitch in their system (I thought it was a true blue system and couldn't be wrong?) and there was nothing they can do about it. This bar has been around for a few years and you still haven't noticed the system invisibly charges for Red Bull?? It was charging us for 2 red bulls but not listing them on the receipt. She illogically compared it to a mixer like Sprite... we told her Sprite is not listed because it is included with the price of the drink. If the mixer is not included in the drink price it has to be listed along with the amount. We felt so uncomfortable because of her terrible accusatory attitude from the get- go that we just paid the amount on the receipt and left. Had the \"manager\" sat down and said \"hey, that's really interesting...let me see why it's not adding up\" instead of blaming us and lying about it, everything would have went a little more smoothly. The owner (GM?) was also there that night and saw what was going on and avoided the whole situation as well. If you're going to try and charge people an invisible $10 on their bill, you should AT LEAST have good customer service. This bar is terrible. I would suggest looking very closely at your bill if you decide to come here."}
{"text":"Came in with a party of 9, last minute for the Monday night special. We were greeted and seated immediately. Service was fast and friendly and no one gave us any dirty looks for bringing the kids. The place was clean. The all you can eat Fish-N-Chips were so yummy. Very fresh, hot and good sized portions. To respond to some other reviewers, this is cod. It's deep fried. By its very nature it's not \"flavorful\". That's what the malt vinegar is for. And spicy mustard. What's important is the fish fresh tasting and firm and the batter not greasy. This place knows what their doing. Plus there's Guinness. On tap."}
{"text":"I used to frequent the original C&A when I lived here in 2002. I just moved back to town and to my delight, found there are now 2!  My husband and I checked out the little C&A and had a nice time. Our beer was good and cold, the bartender was nice and beautiful. The fish and Chips were good, and the patrons were playing great music from the juke box the whole time....how could you not like the place?  Definitely not quite the atmosphere of the big one, but it accomplished all of it's pub duties, plus I don't have to drive through the strip to get there now that I live in the NW. The other one is easy to get to from Green Valley (where I lived before)"}
{"text":"Stopped by after Korean bbq dinner Friday night to have a few drinks. The first waitress with glasses was rude and seemed angry with us. When asked what's on tap? She rudely replied 'Lots'. Granted the menus were on the table, but c'mon.. It's called service. When we got the second server girl, we asked if the other was angry at us and she assured us she was taking care of us now.. When we continued to comment about the poor attitude of the other server, the new server got defensive and said that's enough, she's part of the crown and anchor family... Not a welcoming experience and will never go back."}
{"text":"A visit to LC&AP has been kicked around for the past five months amongst the office crew but never seemed to survive the popular vote.  That was until last week when we finally got to pay the pub a visit during lunch time.  The atmosphere was pubby and well designed for drinking.  Something sadly we could not do during the lunch hour.  The bar appeared spacious and they have dart boards.  The TV's were set to European football.  The bartender also our waitress was full of moxie.  We all ordered the fish n' chips most of us had long craved along some ice tea.  One would think that ice tea would come well ahead of the actual meal.  This did not happen.  Barley sodas reign supreme here.  Again..we were on our lunch hour and the fermented drink is forbidden.   When our lunch arrived the fried fish came with chips and a side of peas.  The group as well as myself were somewhat put off by the varying warm spots on our plates.  Some fries warm, some hot.  Some parts of the single fish fillet warm and some not so warm.  This establishment appears to be more of a watering hole than lunch place."}
{"text":"I had always been to the Tropicana Establishment which I love.  My friends and I were in the area yesterday and stopped by to have a drink.  The experience was extremely refreshing from the minute we were greeted by Sammy, the bartender.  She has an amazing personality and answered all of my questions.  I will definately come back and recommend this bar to friends!!"}
{"text":"christine is great and extremely attentive!  love how you're treated like a person and not based off of how much you're putting into the machines... highly recommend the chicken fingers or wings for their breading alone"}
{"text":"Fish and chips, darts, and scotch eggs. On Spring Mountain, no less! The fish and chips are decent, though I find the breading itself a little on the thick side- easy to pick off though, and has the right texture without being overly greasy. Thick pieces of fresh cod are used. Chips are steak-cut and plentiful, but lack seasoning. Easily amended with malt vinegar, also available in packets if you order to go. Side of peas is not my thing.  Service is friendly, bar itself offers Wednesday special for medical professionals called \"Scrub Night\"- first drink is free with medical ID or coming dressed in scrubs."}
{"text":"Great place to hang out with friends and get a few drinks.The food is delicious, I recommend the Scotch egg or chicken fingers. The atmosphere during the World Cup was so much fun, and the service was still great even when it was packed full of screaming Americans. They also have trivia nights on Saturday that are fun!"}
{"text":"Good beer good service awesome appetizers, the Scott egg and banger wrap were amazing, I should have skipped an entree and just doubled up on the small stuff."}
{"text":"Went to C& A for the FA Cup final May 19th.I wanted to order food but I was early and kitchen wasn't open. Undaunted I ordered a brew from Christine my charming barkeep.Nice and cold I quaffed a few and chatted with my fellow supporters ( I'm Chelsea) Match started and I ordered Bangers and Mash which was tasty and worth the wait! Enjoyed the Chelsea triumph and reluctantly left. Will visit again on my next Sin City excursion."}
{"text":"I always dislike giving negative scores but unfortunately this location was not as good as their Tropicana location. I was there yesterday around 11am with a friend for a quick brew and lunch. For starters the place reeked of bad eggs. I understand 11am is a bit early for a small pub so i know staff will be light but the guy there was in his office. He called out to us from his office and said he would attend us. Didn't even bother to come out. My friend went to use the restroom. I stayed near the bar, and after 3 minutes we left. My friend used the bathroom and the guy never came out. Normally i would have waited but the smell was pretty bad and honestly did not want to eat food in a place like that. I know bars aren't gonna smell great because of smoking and what not but the smell was pretty strong. With that said check out their Tropicana location. They are great. It is spacious, cleaner and staff is great. Also great for soccer games."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and friendly service!  Fish and chips, the meat pies,  and the sticky toffee  Cake is to die for it's the best..and Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I spent about an hour and a half here on Christmas day. What a gem. I didn't eat here so I can't comment on the food but the atmosphere,service and the general vibe of the place is awesome. We had so much fun here we went back a few days later and had an even better time. We met tons of locals. They pour a decent Guinness. Little Crown and Anchor will be on my list whenever I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Got a tip from a friend of a friend that the Little Crown n Anchor has a better lamb/beef roast Sunday meal. Was also told to go as early as possible because it tends to sell out quick and when it's gone it's gone.  Given that today was Sunday, I do enjoy lamb, and it was pretty early a buddy and i figured we give it a shot.  The roast plate comes with a few slices of lamb, a giant yorkshore pudding, peas, carrots, some kind of sour vinegarie dipping sauce, a pat of butter,a piece of deep fried potato and an additional bowl of gravy.   The lamb itself wasnt very gamey tasting and had a present rosemary flavor to it. The slices themselves were fairly meaty with some fat for flavor. Gravy did an excellent job complementing the meat. Peas and carrots were your average canned sweet peas, the carrots were boiled down to the point where they were soft but mostly lost all their sweet carrotie goodness. The potato was interesting. Seemed they boiled it first then deep fried it to give it flavor and a crispy shell, potatoes are good... Yorkshore pudding wasnt exactly my favorite but who cares? We're here for lamb and we had some lamb.  Overall 10.95 is a bit pricey for the plate hence the three star instead of a four. If the slices were a bit thicker or maybe two more slices it would have been perfect and justifiable for the cost. In the end it was still a decent plate of lamb roast."}
{"text":"Kristine, she makes the most amazing Bloody Mary!!!! You gotta come visit her for one"}
{"text":"This is a smaller version of the Crown & Anchor on the eastside. I actually prefer this location. It's smaller, the bartender is super friendly, and they have darts. And in addition to all the beer, they also have a full menu. This time, I opted for the burger. It was delicious! And, of course, you can't go wrong with the curry sauce for dipping your fries in. This is a nice little gem on Spring Mountain."}
{"text":"Since I haven't tried British food yet, we decided to give this place a try. We ordered chicken fingers for our appetizer. To me, it had a weird taste to it, but apparently my boyfriend didn't have that same problem. I was fairly satisfied with the chicken curry dish, mainly because it was flavorful compared to my love's cornish pastie dish (which was extremely bland to me). The sticky toffee pudding here is delightful!! I honestly wish that I ordered another one to take home with me.  Overall, this place serves decent food with average service. I wouldn't mind stopping by again to try something else from the menu and have some alcohol next time."}
{"text":"So to start the ambience is just beautiful the lighting it great and the decorations really sell the Pub feel. Along with the TVs playing different sports, a dart board, and nice classical rock playing loud enough to be heard but not so loud touching can't talk. I had fish and chips which were the best in the city even better than the ones at Gordon Ramsay's Pub! My wife had the cottage pie that was super delicious and authentic. My son had chicken tenders which according to him are the best chicken tenders in the city better than Cane's or any other location. Also we had Mozzarella Sticks as an appetizer which were so good they weren't perfect cylinders so they had a more realistic look than all the processed ones that are always the same size and shape."}
{"text":"Great little bar. Awesome fish n chips! Love the atmosphere. Great service, good prices. Overall great local bar. I will definately be back."}
{"text":"The Skinny: there's a reason why it's a pub - when you drink enough, the food has got to taste better (2), service - cute little Britney Spear-esque school girl outfits does not constitute good service unless - well, you're some place else (2), value - there's no value on bad food.  To sum up our experience: when we got into the car, the first thing my husband said was \"do you think I'll get sick from the chicken pot pie?\"  We headed here looking for a slice of British fare, ordering fish and chips, chicken/leek pie, and a side salad.  To start, the chicken pot pie was absymal. Albeit the pastry was a nice flaky crust, the filling was sour and unpleasant. I have no idea why it was sour. Hence, the question about my husband's intestinal health soon afterwards (he's fine but felt like he dodged a bullet). The uninspired mashed potatoes came with a generic gravy and frozen peas.  The fried fish was overbreaded, greasy and soggy on the bottom from either the moisture of the fish or the oil pool on the plate. The accompanying tartar sauce was too heavy on the mayo and lacked acidity to cut through the richness of the sauce. The chips were not crispy on the outside and were bleh.  The side salad was okay but the house vinegar/oil dressing had chunks of dried rosemary in it which made it unappetizing.  Finally, our waitress. We had to wave her several times to refill our drinks and she gave us the wrong check. I think she switched our check with the table next to us which is a bit mistake on her part (their check was 3x more than ours). I felt bad for her at the end of the day.  As someone who appreciates beer and British culture, I could see this place being fun to check out a football game or some great brews. As a person who is just coming for the food, I would suggest you spend your hard earned dollars elsewhere."}
{"text":"Decent Draft Beer variety, the Fish, Chips, and Tartar Sauce taste fine, but I took off a star because neither were crispy which I prefer, the Fish & Chips while warm, were soft and limp.  The young Female Bartender is nice enough and the place seems semi clean.  I met some interesting people here and had some interesting conversations...it's a pretty laid back place.  I deducted 1 star because there was a malfunction with one of their video slot machines and they made me wait about an hour and a half to get my money about 120$ Dollars back.   I waited and waited while they tried to verify that I had actually had put money in the machine, after they finally \"verified\" and gave me back my money.  I said, see \"I was telling the Truth\" I was told they believed me the whole time, yeah sure right lol...  However, did they offer me free drinks or food or even just a discount for my excessively long wait for them to straighten things out?   Hell No, I paid full price for the meal and 4 Draft Beers.  So, I now have the unpleasant chore of deducting Stars from a business, it's sadly my only recourse for the poor customer service ie: not offering some form of compensation for making me wait a ridiculously unacceptable long time for my hard earned money."}
{"text":"Warm beer on draft- so I guess- wait that was way too much $ to be authentic- Nicole behind the bar  truly enthusiastic- fish n chips a lot of grease not any flavor"}
{"text":"Not really a great pub but more like a bro sports bar with a dark wood interior and some UK beers on tap. If you like loud 90s extreme radio, you'll feel comfy here. Lots of Nickleback and Pearl Jam. The food here is expensive and not even good quality (with British food how is that even possible?). Oh well."}
{"text":"If you find yourself at the little crown and anchor, you will certainly be able to watch Carlos service his customers."}
{"text":"This place is great! They have a great beer selection and the food is delicious. The staff is phenomenal, their graveyard bartender Carlos is amazing and always gives the best customer service! Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"we popped into the Crown and anchor as we was in the area and looking for a British store for gravy. any way we received a Warm welcome from Michelle the bar maid, the bar is clean and tidy, we sat at the bar and ordered our drinks and food, My Hubby had Bangers and mash and I had My normal Fish n Chips, the service was great the food was amazing, the atmosphere was great. really nice to go to play darts and have some lunch or dinner, and if you like fish n chips like me Monday from 5pm is unlimited fish n chips for a small price. we will be back many times this is a great place to come eat, drink, chat and relax, thanks for a wonderful Lunch Michelle and Crown and anchor team!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go during off peak times.  Something about knowing that a Long John's Silver once occupied this spot and it is now a slightly divey, miniature imitation of a special spot resounds in my heart.  You'll find me here having a scotch egg on Thanksgiving morning...throwing darts with my dad...pint in hand and smiling.  Little Crown is in an older neighborhood, not too far from my childhood memories, that screams for a place like this.  Come here for darts, Scotch Eggs, and English/Irish Pints!"}
{"text":"Looked for a British pub to get some good fish and chips. Found this place on Yelp and drove over. Walking in I found out that it has a pretty big bar and we were seated right next to it. Very fricken loud in here and the smell of smoke is awful. Ordered the fish and chips and waited. The order came to the table and it was a decent sized piece of some kind of fish. Was served with thick fries and some peas. The batter wasn't good. The fish was tasteless and it was unchewable on one side of it. The waitress never came back to ask about our food as she was also the bartender. Also, my soda was flat and had NO carbonation. Place overall sucks and I will never spend a dime in this waste of space crap-hole!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It's close to home and offers good beer and even better food. Saturday night a group of friends and I went for Trivia night (we missed it by one) and had a blast. I have to give kudos to the girl that served us...  There were 15 of us and we were constantly moving around, getting up to go to the bathroom, playing darts, etc., and there was more than one check so I was pleasantly surprised that she got my girlfriend and I's bill correct LOL. I'm impressed and also, sorry for the headache we probably gave you."}
{"text":"Sara is an amazing bartender! She was super attentive and cool! She recommended the fish and chips which were unreal and we had sone chicken fingers for an app and loved it! We will be back on our next vacay!"}
{"text":"I have many fond memories of this place - and many not so memorable ones as well. I threw my first perfect cricket game here. BTW, that's darts for those of you who don't know what I was referring to - and that was the only reason why I stopped in on my last visit to Las Vegas. Well, that and beer.  The place is cozy which means it's not very big but it's big enough if you're not in a big group and you're just throwing darts and drinking some adult beverages. I didn't try the food but I recall back in the day, it wasn't \"all that\" unless you were drunk. There's tons of restaurants on Spring Mountain.   I'm a fan of just about every bar that still hangs up steel tip dart boards. I love darts - and I don't mean the soft tip variety. I mean, c'mon! How many sports allow you to drink alcohol (I do) and throw sharp projectiles?"}
{"text":"Was not busy, 1 customer in the bar. Sat down at the bar I suppose we were inconveniencing the bartender because she keep her head down in her phone, we sat for another 30 seconds when we asked what type of ciders were available to which she mumbled to her phone, I told her I couldn't understand what she was saying to which she turn around and gave us a nasty look and with a attitude told us then went back to her phone. Just wanted to stop by for a few drinks with my girl, I've been here several times over the years and I never seen such horrible customer service. We stood up and walked out and to our dismay she just continued on her phone. Won't be coming back anytime soon. I own a business down the street and myself and several associates used to come in all the time, it's no wonder why people stopped going. Went PTs instead which was busier and got we got welcomed and ask what we would like. A shame with this economy because were great tippers and like to support local business's."}
{"text":"Nice place to unwind after work. Good atmosphere where the music is not too loud so that you cannot carry on a conversation.  They serve a good variety of \"English Pints\" on draft for about $6 for a good Belgian beer. Food is available if you desire, offering traditional pub food like burgers, sandwiches, breakfast and of course fish n chips."}
{"text":"Food was good. Waitress was rude.  I came here w/ a group of my friends around 11pm on a Saturday night (this last Labor Day weekend). We were bar hopping and my friend suggested the place. I understand that it's late on a Saturday night and there are a lot of drunks by now, but don't treat customers (who aren't even drinking) in a dull manner. My friends and I just ignored our waitress's attitude and enjoyed our time. We all ordered their fish and chips and it was very tasty. After we paid the bill that we went to another bar and took our business else where. I'm hesitant on going back."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years-  they even have a Sheffield United scarf hanging up in the pub!  Great food and a wonderful staff-  definitely recommend the fish and chips,  some crisps and curry, or the roast on a Sunday or Holiday-  the bangers and mashed anytime and the full Monty for breakfast-  they have HP sauce, ya just need to ask for it-  good British ale and good company make for a nice night out!"}
{"text":"This place is too small but after a few ciders it didn't matter!! This is the only true pub in town. Great Scotch Eggs and Fish-n- Chips.   I hope to never see this place on dirty kitchens like the other Crown & Anchor."}
{"text":"Had a sudden craving for meat pie so I decided to check out Crown and Anchor. This place is kinda dank and dreary but you'd expect that from a bar. Tried the Scottish Egg which consists of a hard-boiled egg wrapped in sausage meat. Different and pleasant enough. I also tried their steak and mushroom pie but found that a bit disappointing. Was hoping for a true pie like you'd get at a pub in London but their pie was a meat concoction in a baking dish with a crust baked on top. Crust was ok but the meat sauce was too tart for me and there was one tiny mushroom in the steak and \"mushroom\" pie. But all is not lost, I snuck a few bites of fish and chips from my friend's plate. Although the steak fries were dry, the fish is nicely battered and tender inside. Overall, I can see this place as a cool hangout for drinking and playing darts but don't come hungry."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday afternoon and the place had two other customers in it, but that didn't stop the bartender from being extremely loud everything she said she had to yell. She had to be the center of attention and it was completely unprofessional and irritating. We had a beer and a glass of wine which by the way they only have Barefoot as a selection for their wine. We also had the fish and chips, the fries were burnt, the fish was mostly just bland breading with a completely unflavorful piece of fish inside of it. I had to drown it with unflavored vinegar and salt before it was even considered edible. Despite the crappy food and the crappy choice of drinks, we still wanted to leave as quickly as possible because of the obnoxious bartender and her loud voice."}
{"text":"So this is a late review, but we came here during christmas shopping.  Was smoky and smelled horrible. It was lunchtime and the drunks at the bar were ridiculous and loud and swearing and yelling.  My wine glass had at least 3 layers of lipstick on it. Food was ok, portions decent but atmosphere was just nauseating.  Guess you got to try it once...and once is all it will ever be."}
{"text":"I love the original Crown & Anchor over by UNLV so I was pretty excited to see that there was a branch a little closer to home on the west-side of town.  I eagerly stumbled in on a cold, rainy night to imbibe in some traditional English brews, have some good pub food, watch some sports and try my hand at some video poker.  I should have stayed in the rain....  Service was fast and friendly but I was disappointed to learn that they only had an abridged menu for food.  My Smithwicks was a nice treat and made the shellacking I took on the video poker a little more palatable.   At least the beer would be free I reckoned, considering my 40 dollar donation I just gave to the machine.  I then decided on a bowl of clam chowder which was good in an unspectacular kind of way.  I watched some soccer they had on tv and then ordered a Harps as I needed something a little lighter.   So you're all thinking two stars....where's that coming from?  Well, let me tell you....I get my bill and both beers are on the tab.  For those of you that are not from Vegas, its a general rule of thumb that the bar takes care of at least one drink per 20 bucks played, more if there feeling generous.  I politely called this to my waitress attention and she said because I wasn't at the bar but at a side table with a machine, they charge.  I said that is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard but not wanting to cause a scene, I gave her my money and promptly left.    Considering there are hundreds of bars in town that wouldn't do a bush league thing like that, I have no need to ever go back there.  In fact, Im sure not even the main Crown & Anchor over on Trop would do that.  Im sure if I pressed the issue I could have had it resolved with a manager but the point is, I shouldn't have to do something like that.  Its akin to a restaurant charging for refills without saying they are and then you get the bill.  In today's society, complimentary soft drink  refills are standard so I shouldn't have to argue about that.  That's how I felt on this matter.  Im giving two stars because everything else was satisfactory and Im willing to give them a shot again down the road once my anger subsides...but if you must, do yourself a favor and head to the Tropicana location, you'll be a lot happier."}
{"text":"My husband and I will sometimes stop by here while we wait for our food to be ready at Hot n Juicy Crawfish.   Its nice and quiet and the service is great. The bartenders are attentive and quite talkative.  We haven't tried the food yet but, from what we hear its also very good.  Great place for a quick beer!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great bartender who makes me feel at home and service is impeccable. Carlos and Art make sure customers are taken care of. Friendly atmosphere. Will miss this place when I move. Thank you guys for a great place to feel welcome."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a traditional Sunday roast dinner.  I'm from New Zealand and Johannes from South Africa so we both grew up with these dinners.  Ordered the mix of lamb and roast beef, served with roast potatoes, peas and Carrots, mint jelly, lashings of gravy and a slightly over cooked Yorkshire pudding.  Service was great by the manager on duty, drink refills were prompt."}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars.  I came to the Little Crown & Anchor Pub because they have trivia on saturday nights at 10pm.  The trivia is very reasonable and not too hard, as compared to some of the trivia spots around the city.  Overall this is a quaint British Pub on Spring Mountain, just outside of China Town.  I would definitely come back here for the Euros or World Cup.  The selection is solid, but not outstanding.  Prices are the usual for Vegas at around $6-$8 for a beer.  Compared to the other Crown & Anchor, this locale is about a third of the size, but I like the bartenders and manager better here.  The biggest thing about this bar is that they do not show prices on their beer menu.  This is one of my biggest pet peeves and really irritates me.  None of the beers are over $8 (I believe), but this always grinds my gears when it comes to bars.  I have been here enough to know how  uch most of the beers go for, but I would still like to see the price on the menu."}
{"text":"I have come here a few times now, and everything/anything can happen at this place. Literally, every time I stop in, some crazy sh*t happens to me. Pretty entertaining.  The first time I ever stopped in, I was supposed to be meeting up with my buddy Tien N. He totally stood me up, too....  LOL, actually, it was a miscommunication sort of thing, but I still tease him about standing me up that night. Anyway, as I sat there all glum and bummy (because none of my other friends wanted to hang out with me), I noticed something. There was a raffle going on. You could win hats, t-shirts, and what else?... BOOZE.  I had a ticket, but me being the unlucky person I am, I knew I wasn't going to win crap. This dude sat down next to me, and commented on me looking like a hipster, where I in turn, commented on him looking like some bum with a fake sports jersey on. Stunned by my snappy response, he apologized and offered up his name. Conversation died out, and soon he was munching on the food he had ordered.  The last raffle of the night, guess what? This dude wins!! He decided to take the bottle of Stoli. Then what does he do? Mutters, \"Merry Christmas...\", hands me the bottle, then promptly walks out. I was stunned. I guess he felt sorta bad..... By gads, it was a Christmas Miracle!!  Oh, and this older, semi-creepy gentleman was hitting on me, because I was there alone. Or maybe because it was simply because I had a vagina. Whatever the case, I explained to him about how I had been stood up, and he leans in and whispers ever so softly, \"That guy is a damn fool if he's gonna miss out on a girl like you.\" Cue in Berlin's \"Take My Breath Away.\"  Funny thing is, he was there the next time, when both Tien N. and Anthony M. were both there, and I pointed, then yelled, \"That's the dude that stood me up!!!\" Tien was just like, \"Huh?....\" Good times.  The ambiance is good, and everyone is pretty laid back. Accept for the crazy jukebox guy. That dude plays the worst music, but he's so happy about it, you can't help but feel good about what's assaulting your ears at that moment.  I have not tried to food here, but I plan on coming back for the AYCE fish and chips sometime in the future, on a \"fatty-poomba\" day."}
{"text":"It's going to be a struggle to write anything nice.   It's the first week of June. Anyone who REALLY knows anything about The Brits and the Irish, know about the Isle of Man TT race every year. I went in here to toast a Guinness to BMW S1000 RR / Tyco rider Dan Kneen who died yesterday at the IOM. Add to that Tommy Robinson being tossed in jail exposing muzzies and I have to tell ya, this place is a total fake! Just like the \"Licensed\" Harley Davidson place on the strip. Completely Fraudulent. So much for \"Ambience\".  The Waitress on shift was nice but won't do a shot with ya cause it's \"not permitted\". There's no patio like the other Crown n Anchor on Tropicana. There's not even any shade to hide your car from the blistering heat of Las Vegas.   Probably won't ever go back. It was that mediocre."}
{"text":"Took an early out from work today to go whit my coworkers for some fish and chip...best in town we've heard...I was kinda surprise to see the Sticky toffee on the menu in such a small place, I find this to be a very complex dessert so I order it...such a disappointment! I usually get up and leave if the dessert is no good, when miracle happened : Dogfish head 90 was spotted between the draft beers!  So I forgot everything about my dry,old sticky toffee and tried to enjoy the fish and chips,  but disappointment hits again, with the dry chips, all the vinegar in the bar couldn't make it bearable...the cod was ok... Would I go there again?! Who knows, maybe after they change their liquor license and I'll be able to have a vodka red bull at the bar, to take my mind off an awful dessert, fallow by not the best Fish and Chips Vegas has to offer! Cheers"}
{"text":"Sometimes a smoke filled 24 hour bar just hits the right notes! Little Crown & Anchor is one of the only spots around Chinatown that we know of who serves food and alcohol all night.   The food is actually really good! (Not the pea's lol but everything else!) They have the best kept secret happy hour angus beef bacon cheese burger with steak fries for $6 from 12a-8a as long as you order a drink.   My only true tiff with this spot is that their liquor license does not allow them to serve liquor at their main bar, only wine and beers... They kindly added a mini side bar where you can sit with your cocktails so you can still drink liquor of but it's just kind of odd.   One time I stepped on a cockroach in the bathroom but I have seen cockroaches in almost every restaurant in Chinatown so don't be so critical."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. They're supposed to have the best fish-n-chips in town.  Fortunately they didn't disappoint! I wouldn't say the best, but they're definitely up there. The Cod was fresh and delicious. However the service left a little to be desired, they only had one waitress. I know it's a small place but damn. It wouldn't have been that bad, but we had uninvited guests at our table who would not leave us alone (gnats) and we wanted our check ASAP. The table next to us were discussing dining and dashing, because they were going through the same thing.  Overall this place wasn't too bad.. If they get rid of the gnats and get some more servers I might just give them another shot."}
{"text":"Such a cute place! I've been to the one on Tropicana before. And have usually lucked out with friendly enough staff and bartenders. But the bar manager at this place (Scooter) is super friendly! Apparently they have trivia there for bar patrons (and i'm told no one pulls fast ones googling the answers, they actually play the game) and while a friend and i were eating he was going through the questions just to keep us entertained.   I'm not a huge beer drinker, so I usually stick to Boddingtons when I'm there, but the place looked to have a decent selection. I imagine less than the Trop location just based on the size of the place, but a nice selection none the less.   Since i did go on a sunday night, I imagine it wouldn't have been packed. but it was perfect for what we were going for. which was a few beers and their chicken curry. The portion was pretty hefty and easily shared between two people.   Since the other location is closer to my house i can see myself going to that one more often. but it was a super treat to get there last night. will probably be back just for Scooter."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try this pub with friends ever since they were voted best fish and chips way back when.  The server was quick to take my order.  I ordered an ice tea, onion rings appetizer, and the fish and chips of course.  The rings came out rather quickly and came with a side of ranch dressing.  Although they were lightly battered, they were literally dripping with oil, so much so there was a small pool of oil on the plate.  The fish and chips consisted of one medium sized piece of fish, thick cut fries, and a small bowl of peas.  The fish was above average, the breading was a touch on the heavy side.  The breading came off with a small amount of vinegar.  The tartar sauce was sweet, making it difficult to taste the relish or any other flavor.  The fries were nothing to write home about, looked overcooked and mushy and the peas were...peas.  The service was the worst part of dining here unfortunately.  Although our waitress was super cute (especially in her outfit) and nice, my ice tea took forever to be refilled and we usually had to request it.  When it came time to ask for the check, she gave us the check from the only other party in the pub.    So disappointing, average food with below average service."}
{"text":"Fave bar in Vegas, was a local there for a number of years. \"The Girls\" are friendly. Great happy hour prices. Plenty of winners on the video poker games too.   The Little Crown in Chinatown is vastly superior to the Crown on Tropicana, which is filled with limeys that glare at you when you walk in, wondering why you are in \"their\" bar.   The beauty of the Little Crown is that the bar is so small, that you can't help striking up a conversation with other folks there, everyone from locals, ex-pat Brits, and tourists. Tell Marlene I said \"hi\".."}
{"text":"I was pretty drained after work, so I was just going to default to an old favorite. But then I drove by this place and remembered that there was something that I had to try on Mondays...  I found out after walking inside that Little Crown & Anchor Pub offers the same all you can eat fish and chips for $13.95 on Mondays (5pm thru midnight) as its big brother does. Having never tried this AYCE special before, I decided to take advantage of the opportunity.  The first plate that they brought out was huge. I'm actually not sure that I would've been able to handle it fully had I been in optimal eating shape. There was a huge pile of chips, a perhaps-too-generous helping of peas, the battered fish (of course), a lemon slice, and a dipping portion of tartar sauce.  I think the crispy batter was the best part of the meal, but the fish itself was slightly dry and fairly bland. Everything was on the bland side really, and no combination of condiments (salt, pepper, malt vinegar, tartar, even ketchup) truly helped the situation. The chips strongly resembled Red Robin's boring steak fries. They'll be happy to bring only fish as a continuation of your AYCE experience, but I ended up with taste buds dulled both by repetition and by some sense of feeling full. And flavor aside, I doubt that the fish filets are premium cuts given their nonchalant attitude toward providing seconds and toward wasted food.  I wouldn't really bother returning to Little Crown & Anchor Pub just for the fish & chips. The service was friendly though, and the music was quite fun fun, both when it had pop and alt/indie rock hits and when they recalibrated the playlist for an older audience."}
{"text":"So I went in there and the outside looked nice (Typical British village homes) Anyway, I ordered 2 Steak and Kidney Pies with mash(which I ordered it to go 1 hour before I went to pick it up but when i got there the lady behind the bar told me 5-10 more minutes), but instead I got Huge chunks of microwaved potato's (not only that but the whole thing was microwaved), The pie just had a crust on top and the filling was revolting and extremely sour. What a shame, I really wanted to like this place since I wanted to relive my childhood memories and have some nostalgia. But no... instead I got something far from British cuisine... When you think of a British Pub or just British food in general, you think of something warm and cozy and very tasty, home made and clean. But not here."}
{"text":"I love me some Crown & Anchor. Every time I am in Vegas I try to stop here. I usually on eat 2 things on the menu and love every minute of it. If it is a Monday Night all you can eat fish and chips are some of the best I have ever had. Any other night of the week I grab the chicken finger and some fries. Warning !!! These chicken finger stand to be one of the best you will ever taste. I know they are a delight to my palate. One think I do wish was a little different here is the bear selection. Though they have a wide verity they don't have many Mexican beers which is usually what I drink. Either way I can't wait for my next time in Vegas so I can get me some Crown & Anchor."}
{"text":"Crown is about great service, cold beer and patrons who appreciate and celebrate both!"}
{"text":"I've been here thrice I was really looking forward to liking this joint but it didn't turn out that way and here's why. My last two experiences were seriously super underwhelming due to the fact that last nights visit the bartender tells us that he doesn't have beer on tap because something broke... Yikes!  Then the visit before this we were told by our waitress after we sat down and ordered drinks that their grill was broken, which meant we couldn't have any grilled chicken or burgers etc... That left all of us trying to suck down some horrible roast beef deli meat + fried chips which was a waste of my taste buds.   At this point I've come to the conclusion that C&A and myself aren't meant to be drinking buddies because every time I'm here there's always something that goes wrong with their equipment.   Anywho, I would encourage any foodies out their to give C&A a go for exploration sake and see what you make out of it  but as for me I'm totally done \"exploring\" the end of my possibilities which came a little too soon... Oh well.   Good luck foodie heads!"}
{"text":"Woohoo!  Finally came in here after driving by so many times.  Cool English pub with some dart boards if that's what floats your boat, and sports channels playing on multiple tvs. Bar poker/keno/etc. too.  Beer is a little on the pricey side I'd say for off the strip ($6 for a pint of Newcastle). Otherwise, the food is pretty fairly priced. So far the best value for fish and chips I've had so far! Mondays are $15 all you can eat fish n chip days! Start of with 2 and add as you go. My friend got the banger on a bun, which he enjoyed.   The was only one server/bartender, and it got moderately busy,  but she definitely held her own, and we had great service. She always made sure I had food sitting in front of me haha.  Looking forward to coming back for some more food and beverage : )"}
{"text":"I go to here many times for have some drink or grab a bit. Staff is always nice and friendly!! English food is good"}
{"text":"I like to go there in around 11 to get coffee and watch the PL or UEFA games, and i always want coffee cause i work late swing so when i wake up around 11,noon, i like to drink coffee sorry i am not sorry, i understand its a bar and they are in the business of serving spirits and sell food and gamble, and i usually always order some breakfast halftime and beer with it, at least thats what i do when i go to the trop location, anyway i went there 3 times this past weeks and everytime i come in sit down and order coffee, the female bartenders there immediately ask if i am gonna order anything else immediately, like fucking seriously???? If am a regular who holds a spot on the bar and stiffs you and only order coffee, but thats not what i do, i will put a 20 in i will order food if i want, and if i only end up having just the coffee you will have a 5-10 tip. Idk if its managment pushing the morning bartenders to just force people to get shit they dont want or they are just unprofessional! Oh well dont give a shit i will drive the extra 4 miles qnd just go to the one on trop!"}
{"text":"We were at Macy's Furniture on Spring Mountain, and thought it would be a great opportunity to try Chinese food for, if you can believe it, our first venture into C-town in our entire 9-year Las Vegas existence.  It didn't happen.  Instead, when we drove by Crown & Anchor, we decided we'd rather have bar food.    After I ordered my usual glass of wine, I noticed the Magner's Cider on the menu, and thought \"Oh well, next time.\"    We had burgers and mine was superb - the meat was excellent, done just right, and the Stilton cheese was an unusual choice (I know, this is a British Pub, but you can't get it at MickeyD's, right?) that really made the burger taste special.  I was able to substitute a salad for the fries with no upcharge, and the salad was fresh romaine loaded with a ton of stuff.  My husband ordered the fish and chips - one piece of fish, but very big, and tons of fries, so I was glad I was able to get the salad, 'cause I helped him eat those very good steak fries.  The highlight was the regular Saturday night Trivia Quiz, but since we're not regulars we had no idea it was happening. It turned out to be serendipitous, since I love, love, love Trivia.    I'd only been to one bar trivia thingy in Vegas before, at McMullan's, and that was so long and complex and ridiculously difficult that my friend and I gave up after 10 questions. This one was different, composed (I learned later) by the manager, Scooter - challenging, shorter (15 questions), and very enjoyable.  Our team consisted of hubby and me, and we named our team YELP.  Unfortunately, Yelp didn't win, but I got to have my Magner's Cider, a great dinner, wonderful conversation with Scooter, and ultimately one terrific evening."}
{"text":"Parked, opened my car door and there was vomit. You know a good time was had inside.   The wings were good. I just had soda but the atmosphere was good. Its a small little place. Probably 6-8 tables and then bar seating.   Service was good. Waiter was nice. Overall a positive experience."}
{"text":"Having gone to the other Crown and Anchor a number of times during my UNLV career, I had the expectation that it'd be more of the same. Well, this is like a reduced-sized version of the other one, thus the \"Little\" in the name.  We walked in on a Friday around 7:30pm (we were just waiting for a table at Hot n Juicy) and were quickly greeted and had our drink orders taken. The gentleman who took our orders informed m'lady that because of their strange liquor license, she could not take her Jack and Coke at the bar, and had to sit at one of the tables. However, I could sit at the bar with my Snakebite. So off to the tables we went.   Our drinks did not disappoint, which was awesome. A girl who works there came up to us once or twice to ask if we needed anything else, as the did the barkeep who made our drinks. They were really friendly and really made me feel comfortable in the place, which was great.   All in all, this is a nice spot. I'll probably return if  I'm in the area, though I don't see this being one of my go-to spots."}
{"text":"Great place to play darts.  They have real darts and you can play for free.  Lots of imported drafts and this place has a pretty low key and chill vibe."}
{"text":"Ah I didn't know this one is called Little Crown & Anchor.  I've always enjoyed Crown & Anchor, but the original always had slow slow service.  This one is worlds apart in that regard.  Kate, our server, was uber-nice.  We ordered the Kate special - basically the graveyard special burger, but the way Kate likes it.  A few beers in the mix and you have yourself a winner."}
{"text":"I come here for two main reasons: its location and to play darts.  With its proximity to the restaurants on Spring Mountain, I'm near this location pretty often, so it makes for a great place to grab drinks before or after dinner.  It also never gets too crowded here, so you shouldn't have a problem coming here with a group and using both of their dart boards.  There is a good selection of draft beers, with Dogfish Head 90 Minute being one of the choices.  Beers are around $6 a pint.  Food seems to be decent, my friends have eaten here but I only come to drink.  They offer a happy hour during the weekdays, but I've never made it and don't know what the specials are.  Saturday nights there is Pub Quiz, which starts at 10:00pm, and winner gets a $50 bar tab I believe.  There are a few things to like, not really anything to dislike.  Overall this is a bar that I go to based on convenience, and there's nothing wrong with that."}
{"text":"Service was fairly good. Took a bit long to get our food considering we were one of only two tables seated in the dining room. Enjoyed the folksy feeling of the dining area but the food left a bit to be desired.   Got the famous fish and chips, but wasn't terribly impressed. The batter was pretty good but I felt like it was taken right out of the fryer and set on the plate so the bottom of my batter was kind of soggy. :(   Also had the scotch egg which was worth trying to have something different but wasn't my fav thing. The Yorkshire pudding would have been pretty good but the pastry was over done and close to burnt on the bottom.   The service wasn't bad - the young lady was nice. Didn't quite expect her bum cheeks to literally be hanging out. I'm sure the gents that frequent the pub don't mind that but glad we didn't bring the 17 yr old and 11 yr old boys that almost joined us!    Overall not a horrible place but for the price and quality of the food I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good beer and a great chicken sandwich!! Laid back atmosphere, awesome trivia on Saturdays."}
{"text":"i guess bad service is required to work at crown & anchor. i've had bad experiences at both locations..  the chicken tenders at this location i feel are not as good as the original. the tenders are good.. but small. fries are standard.. but when you're drinking beer.. fries are great! lol  i came in to meet a couple friends who had arrived earlier. i sat down and the bartender asked my friend if he wanted a drink. she gave him his drink and continued serving other patrons. then several minutes later she comes to me and asks if i'm good. how could i be good when i haven't been served a drink? i asked for my beer and got it without a wait. 2 others joined our group and the same bartender ignored them for a long time. no bueno..  we ordered more drinks and the bill came out before our drinks.. we had to remind them that we didnt get out drinks yet.. it wasnt super busy.. but it felt like it was with the way we were being ignored.   i hear that the bartenders there that night were not the usuals.. i will come back and hope for a better experience. playing darts helped pass the time.."}
{"text":"I'll be honest my first visit here about a year ago was unimpressive.  I had the fish and chips and was not impressed.  But my father was visiting and I was tired of buffets.  I knew that he likes British/Irish pub food so I suggested the Little Crown & Anchor.  Much better this time around.  He had steak and kidney pie, which he loved.  I enjoyed my Scotch egg and Cornish Pastie.  Service was good.  Only downside is that this is a Seahawks bar. What's up with that?  GO PATS!!!"}
{"text":"Waitress was pleasant and darts were on point. The evening I went nothing was on tap;  issue with the lines???.  Ended up ordering bottled beer while there;  found it odd that mixed drinks couldn't leave the bar to the area where the darts are at.  Good local hangout spot."}
{"text":"Love this little place! It's tiny, but we got great service, good Fish and Chips, and Pasties, and they let me turn off a jukebox making a high pitch squeal. :)  The French Dip tasted like liver but had a good consistency, can't recommend it.  The lunch special is if you play $40 at full bet you get lunch SND a drink for free!  Not the best area, lock your windows. Never had any other problems there."}
{"text":"The  little crown is just as fun as the big one and a lot less crowded!  The old man and I are found there during football (soccer) season watching the games and hangin' with other locals.  Carlos is the best bartender EVER and quiz night is a ton of fun!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Little Crown for 6 years. It was introduced to me by a friend who performed with Cirque at the time. It's right up the street from TI and the Mirage where Mystere and The Beatles LOVE play. It's a staple for them after work. It quickly became mine as well.   Carlos started out as a perfectly attentive bartender. Over the years he has become a dear friend. Always cheerful and welcoming, he takes great care of his guests, whether it's their first time visiting or their thousandth. There's a great sense of comraderie at Little Crown. I go there and know everyone and vice versa. There's always someone to talk to, always something to talk about. The food is DELICIOUS! The chicken fingers are life-changing. And of course I enjoy the \"Danyel Special!\"  Open 24 hours, whether I'm off at midnight or 4AM, I have somewhere I can go where I'm comfortable, can get good food, good drinks, and play a bit. Even if I never win, lol! I love this bar!!"}
{"text":"Typical British pub. The most memorable thing about this place was how BAD the steak and mushroom pie was - yuck! Perhaps it's just not my type of food but the flavor was so appalling I could barely eat it, I ended up leaving the pub hungry!"}
{"text":"Was here about 3:30 am on Fri/20 Sep: - About 8 beers on tap.  I went with the Pyramid Hefeweisen. - Friendly, responsive staff. - Convenient location at the intersection of Decatur & Spring Mountain."}
{"text":"Bartender was funny, beer selection is decent and bonus star for having real darts! When they say \"little\" crown & anchor, they aren't kidding. The place looks bigger on the outside.  They have weird rules for drinking liquor which are confusing but I guess is out of their hands? Not sure how that all works but sucks that I can't get a cocktail at the bar or anywhere for that matter unless I order food apparently.  Didn't eat any food, played a few games of darts (and beat Mario in both :-p haha). All in all, good time and I'll probably stop in again sometime."}
{"text":"It was more of a 2.5 star experience, but a lot closer to \"I've experienced better\" than \"A-OK\".  We went in for the all you can eat fish and chips on Monday which sounds better than you feel after 3 reorders.  It wasn't overly greasy (except for the last 2) but the breading on the fish just lacked in flavor and the fish was frozen cod (not that I was expecting beer-battered halibut). So after downing a plate full of thick steak fries and getting a few reorders, I called it a day at 6 large pieces and requested the bill and walked out not entirely full but not wanting anymore...the quality is better than something out of the frozen section at the grocery store but less than I've had in any other restaurant. At 14.95 x 2 plus tax and tip, I could have had a better meal at 100 other places in town.  This experience departed 3 star territory when we left the place, and even though no one was smoking inside the establishment, our clothes wreaked of cigarettes. No Bueno.  Next time I'll listen to the girlfriend and head for some Vietnamese."}
{"text":"Little Crown & Anchor is a tiny bar with a lot of character. It is especially a win if you're a soccer nut. That's not my thing, but I can appreciate that there is a place for them in a country that named our sport in which you throw a ball that can't touch the ground, football. There are free darts here as well, so that is pretty awesome.   One quirk I gotta get out of the way before I sing any more praise. They have an absurdly antiquated liquor license in which you can only drink beer at the bar. If you want the hard stuff you gotta feel like an outcast at the tables. Ok, so in a small place like this, perhaps outcast is a bit of an exaggeration. And they do have machines at some tables so you could still get your gamble on if that's your thing.   Now onto the positive stuff. The staff is always super friendly here. Bartenders always make me feel welcome, they are generous on comps, and the female bartenders are equipped with pretty awesome work attire. I'm pretty sure everyone loves school girl skirts, so that's a genius move on their part. They are genuine here too, we can BS about anything without the pretentious, keeping it proper type of conversation. I always appreciate genuine people. The food is also really good. I've had the burgers, which are not bad, but the chicken fingers are where they seem to shine. Nothing is outrageously priced, but including fries with their fingers would be a better choice in my book. The grilled chicken sandwich is pretty good too! Overall this is a great place to check out for a local bar. If you have any soul or decency, always avoid PTs and Dotties. These are the kinds of places to support."}
{"text":"Good place for reasonable food and drinks!  Since we were hungry, we started with the food order and a couple drafts.  Authentic English Fish & Chips ($10.95): One-Half Pound of Beer Battered Icelandic Cod, Fries & Peas. Huge chunk of juicy, flavorful cod! Very enjoyable...recommended!  Kart and Abdul tried the Sunday Dinner ($10.95): Roast Beef or Roast Lamb, Yorkshire Pudding, Roasted Potatoes, Vegetables & Gravy. Super filling portion size!   Everything was good...I'd come back and sample more of the menu :)"}
{"text":"This is where I ended up on a girls' night out in celebration of my birthday. One of my friends, being a regular here, knew what was up. Good casual atmosphere with a jukebox and on Saturdays they have a trivia game in which the winner gets $50 off their tab. That's pretty good incentive to come in my mind, it's a fun group-oriented activity and of course free to play. It's not just some lame game they try to put on but everyone in the place, especially the regulars, gets really into it.  Being a pub I also expected there to possibly be more unwanted characters, as my friend the regular had said, but the crowd was good and we got to talking to some guys that had interesting things to say instead of stupid pick up lines and perverted jokes. We were there from about 11pm til 2 am just talking and joking around with them for most of that time. I had a great time but was definitely disappointed in the hefeweizen selection, they ONLY have Franziskaner, which is decent but at least offering 1 more type would actually be considered variety. Friendly service and a good crowd atmosphere will let me give this place more chances though, if only to hang out with a Stella and try out their food."}
{"text":"I don't eat here. I will occasionally steal somebody's fries (they're the nice wide, steak variety). I don't play video poker, and I am not generally here at any time that might be considered peak. I arrive on a Tuesday afternoon, a Monday evening or a summer Sunday when the place is pretty much empty. I am usually with a personal posse of people who want to do two simple things: drink a pint and play some darts. They have two boards and ample space for slinging. This is what we do, and I really have no complaints. I am sure we'll be back, and I am sure all we will ever do is drink and dart. It's what the place does best."}
{"text":"I went for the Sunday roast, a traditional British classic. I ordered the sliced lamb roast and it was served with peas, carrots, Yorkshire pudding and roasted potatoes. The food was rustic and heavenly, it is just how I imagine my grandparents cooking to be...  The service was exceptional. Compared to the crown and anchor on trop, this place is the place to be. Real people who care about customer service run the show...the same can't be said about the other location.  I recommend an appetizer portion of the Yorkshire pudding, they do it better than anyone in town. To me, that deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"They have my fave ginger beer! This was one pub visited amidst a pub crawl with some friends. The waitress was not only adorable in her little kilt, she was also very sweet and patient. We ordered a sausage roll and some onion rings with drinks. The sausage roll took me right back to London with its flaky crust and mild sausage flavor. The onion rings were spectacular! We deduced that they must use the same crispy batter for their fish and chips. I love that this place is in the Chinatown area too, gives you another option for drinking with friends."}
{"text":"I Love this place! I Love the way it is decorated, it has a really cozy feel. And the chicken strips are the bomb! They serve nice steak fries here as well. I'm always looking for steak fries. The last time I went our waitress' name was Sarah & she was delightful. She was very friendly, sweet, welcoming & helpful. Service like that is what really sets a place apart, along with the food of course! The food is always hot and fresh. I Love the environment, food & excellent service. I don't go there to drink, so the no liquor at the bar doesn't bother me. Plus, it's a small, cozy place, so who cares? But when I used to drink I would go there & have a beer at the bar. Always a nice time."}
{"text":"To be honest... I expected a lot more from this place. It sounded good and there aren't that many places to eat this type of food.  My boyfriend ordered the Shepard's pie. It wasn't anything special. I ordered the fish and chips. It was one big piece of fish 0.0 nice portion, but I didn't like that the crunch/fried part was just the outside layer. Nice batter though.   The drinks were decently priced with a good selection. Would come back to hang out with friends"}
{"text":"Fish and chips are everything you would expect them to be.  Outside of building is a little intimidating but inside does not reak of smoke and is clean."}
{"text":"Great Food, Good Beer, Friendly staff.  Just wish it was a touch bigger, but then it might loose some of its charm."}
{"text":"Strangest liquor license I've ever encountered in any state?  They can only serve wine and beer at the bar, but if you walk 3 steps backwards and sit at another table [not at the bar] they can serve you liquor?  This is like an old school Irish Pub, with really cold glasses for beer, at least 15 choices of beer on draft, dart boards, fish 'n chips, soccer flags everywhere, oh and gambling they have gambling [free drinks! and they comp 'em if you play].  Also, the cast of characters sitting at their bar is pretty freaking amazing.  Great people watching here, eves dropping, and feeling better about your life.  They have a lot of TV's for such a small location. And really good music! And purse hooks... She shoots she SCORES!!!  Surprisingly, they proudly display an A rating from the health dept to boot!  We were both shocked!"}
{"text":"The little crown and anchor is a little more laid back than it's larger counterpart.  It's my go-to soccer-watching bar.  It's nice, and dark with plenty of seating.  There usually aren't any screaming sports fans either (which is a plus for me). The selection of draft beers is awesome (I love that they have Boddington's on tap).  The food is good too.  You can't go wrong with the fish and chips, but I haven't been disappointed with anything I've had here."}
{"text":"I know its lame but I've never made it to the C&A on the eastside of town but I like this place a lot!!  We went to take advantage of the $1 off pints happy hour last Sunday and also stumbled into dinner there.  REALLY enjoy the chicken curry for some reason and the Sunday dinner w/ roast beef, potatoes, peas and bread pudding was great for $10.    Its all you need from a British style pub and I've been really liking the oatmeal stouts recently too."}
{"text":"First it was a Hush Puppy, then a Tilt and Kilt, now it's a Crown & Acre. Okay for late night food. I'm giving it 3 stars only for nostalgia. I used to go to the las Vegas blvd & Oaky location way back when. Not good for families or dates. This is Loners destination. Decent microwaved Bangers and Mash. Good 80's music. Extra .5 points because the owner deemed this a Seahawks bar."}
{"text":"This may very well become my favorite local bar! Great Atmosphere, staff is very nice and on top of things. The on tap selection is awesome for Football Sunday's!. Overall a great place to feel welcome and comfortable."}
{"text":"This pub is great. Small, quaint and the service and staff are both awesome. Great food too... best chicken fingers in town! Bring cash money with you, especially if you plan to gamble because the ATM at this place is CONSTANTLY OUT OF ORDER. Not just once or twice a month, but more like for a few days at a time, every week. They're losing money from gamblers by not having a working ATM on property."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Love the Yorkshire pudding. French dip sandwich was good. Ice tea was odd tasting. One complaint was tables were sticky. Mens bathroom wasn't as clean as should be. Closes to Britain I have had in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here with one of my Yelp friends Aaron K. Originally we were gonna go to \"Basic\" but they were closed. We ended up coming here instead.   Due to the confidentiality agreement I signed to obtain my job, I am prohibited from drinking alcohol, and gambling. So, I practically just sat there. But, I had a good time.   Both Aaron and I come from families that immigrated to America over 100 years ago to work in the sugar canes of Hawaii. Aaron is 100% 3rd generation Japanese, and my Dad is 100% Japanese and my Mom is Korean, so we most definitely will stick out like a sore thumb at a British Pub. But, in the end we didn't. Everyone was really friendly. Whenever I have to sit at a bar, I am very used to some drunk idiot blaming me for \"Pear Harbor\" or some stupid sh!t like that. But, the people who come to drink here are all actually really friendly.  They got AYCE fish and chips on Mondays. This might keep bringing me back here.  I also thought it was cool how they had all those pictures of Ricky Hatton on the walls before he died against Manny Pacquaio. Seriously, what ever happened to that guy?"}
{"text":"Xmas British dinner with my father.  Ab Fab and totally Brill idea!  Game of darts, Dad?"}
