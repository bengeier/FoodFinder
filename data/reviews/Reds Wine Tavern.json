{"text":"Went to Reds last night for some drinks and apps with a few others. Considering it was a Saturday (all the Bay crowd is gone) it was pretty busy! Our server was attentive and friendly. Struck up conversations at the right time and was very knowledgeable and helpful (can't remember their name). The music selection left a little to be desired but someone that visited our table (Manager?) let us know they have a DJ Thursdays and Fridays now from 5:30-the party ends. Definitely be back for that! My husband and I had the lettuce wraps, chicken wings, and potato flatbread. The lettuce wraps were out of this world... I could drink the peanut sauce! The flatbread had amazing flavour but it's a bit much for two people. The wings were fantastic too; the server said they use hollandaise mixed with Frank's hot which is a genius idea...I'll be doing that at home! Overall a great experience!"}
{"text":"Came with friends.   Disappointed with quality of meal.   Pork over salted, gnocchi under salted, shrimp pasta no acknowledgment of it even being decent.  Service was attentive."}
{"text":"VENUE: This venue doesn't seem to want you to forget you're in a liquor licensed establishment. A big wine rack sits in the middle of the dining room, and almost everywhere you turn are furniture pieces laced with beer bottles or wine glasses.

FOOD:

Tavern Cheese and Butcher Board ($28.99) - chef's selection of cheeses, cured meats, pickles, preserves and bread
A great selection of cured meats and a selection of potent cheeses. What I loved the most were the preserves. The little container of what looks like olives are actually preserved baby kiwis. Really unique from most other preserves.

Wild Mushroom Soup -Parmesan crouton, knoki and celery salad
Usually I'm more of a salad girl, but I can never resist having mushroom soup. I was a bit disappointed when it was the regular pureed mushroom soup with cream, but more so a broth with mushrooms. I didn't care for this style of soup too much..

Grilled Pacific Yellowfin Tuna Nicoise - argula, fried egg, marinated beans, pickled onions, roasted cherry tomatoes
Definitely a winner as far as starters go. The tuna is nicely seared with the centre still raw.

Jet Fresh Fish - Daily fish special, seasonal garnish
Canadian Prime Striploin - grilled fried rapini, charred onion jus, fries

The entrees in comparison to the other 2 courses of the meal were decent but unmemorable. The portions are generous for the pricetag, and typically executed. You don't get anything beyond the ordinary, but sometimes that's all you really need.

Grasshopper Pie - Chocolate & Mint schnapps mousse, Oreo cookie crumble base
Having a big sweet tooth probably doesn't give me much credibility when I provide opinions on dessert. My boyfriend Rob on the other hand, doesn't really care for sweets, and above all he HATES chocolate mint. So the fact that even HE liked this Grasshopper Pie was a testament to how good it was. The mousse is rich but very subtle in mint flavour, not leaving you with a \"just-mouthwashed\" sensation. The oreo crisps are a nice bonus too! 

OVERALL THOUGHTS:
At the end of it, I really enjoyed my experience at Reds Wine Tavern. The desserts were exceptional, the venue is classy yet inviting, and the price point is extremely reasonable given its location in the financial district. Definitely would return for future meals."}
{"text":"Nice patio to have lunch/drink. Wait staff weren't terribly interested in seating me. Good wine selection, lobster guacamole overpriced and lacking."}
{"text":"Reds Wine Tavern is a Sir Corp-standing for Service Inspired Restaurants-venue with two locations in the core of Toronto, a growing sister brand to the unfailingly popular Jack Astor's that the corporation also owns.

Though we live closer to the Yonge & Gerrard location, Reds Midtown Tavern, we decided to check out the Reds downtown in the financial district, located at 77 Adelaide St W. After a month-long closure in 2012, the restaurant has since re-invented itself as a cheery after-work hotspot with fabulous food.

20121017-5The Good: A light, shareable menu with plenty of seafood: Pacific albacore tuna tataki, crispy calamari, oysters & PEI mussels. A smattering of pub favourites like chicken wings and cheeseburger sliders convince the grease-cravers to stay, while fresh and inventive salads-avocado & lobster cobb, and a Mediterranean-style lamb sirloin-are pleasant additions to a well-rounded menu. Large tables with plush seating on the second floor leave diners with a glowing view of Adelaide Street below, while a bar & lounge downstairs caters to a drop-in clientele.

The Bad: The tuna tataki was a bit overdone, and the service was very slow. It appeared that the restaurant was understaffed on the particular night we visited, and there was a large birthday party which commanded most of our waiter's attention.

Overall: Reds may not be somewhere you want to eat when you're in a rush. While our food took a long time, we were served our drinks right away; our seats were so comfortable that we didn't mind. The music is somewhat hushed for such a prime and trendy location, which made for a surprisingly relaxed and un-rushed Friday night dinner. Reds definitely facilitates a catch-up with old friends, and is romantic enough for an intimate date. It ultimately does a good job of disguising itself as a chain.

The Crowd: Plenty of 30-something business people indulging after work, early to mid 20-somethings enjoying a night out with friends

Pricing: $7.00-17.95 for appetizers, $13.85-34.00 for entrees, $7 & up for drinks"}
{"text":"The A-OK is because the service brought down the rating.

Food: Got the cobb salad with shrimp. It was delicious! When reading the description I anticipated it to be like an ordinary cobb salad but this was not. The combination of all the ingredients (sans the blue cheese which I opted out of for cheddar) worked so well together. The added soft-boiled egg was a good touch to it. Service: Terrible. It took about 20 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us. Finally the busser came by and set our table, gave us water, and menus. The server came by to acknowledge about another 20 minutes after that to which we were ready to order (after 40 minutes you should know what you want). Our food came and was brought by the runner but not once during our meal did the server come by and ask us if everything was fine. I really wanted to tip her 10% (and that was being nice). Ambience: Cool ambience. There is indoor seating and outdoor seating. We sat outside since it was a nice night. Their was a wall that separated the outdoor seating from the side walk but it was still noisy (a good noisy) enough where you felt like you were still in the city"}
{"text":"Had dinner there Friday night while visiting Toronto from NYC. They have a lovely patio, but it was pretty clamorous so we asked to be seated upstairs. Our excellent server Tyson was a total pleasure. When we confessed that we had never had an Ontario wine, he gave us a quick snapshot. We had a bright rose' and a wonderful red called The Foreigh Affair Conspiracy which I hope to find in NYC. Their wine list is quite extensive with plenty of choices for every pocketbook.


We had a very tasty meal + would definitely go back."}
{"text":"3.5/5! Reds has improved significantly from the last time I went there 3 years ago. It's a great spot for after work drinks. I recommend the lamb salad or braised lamb for those planning to go for dinner."}
{"text":"I had the absolute worst service here. My waitress went missing most of the night and when we asked the bar tender we got nothing but attitude.  Especially annoying since it was completely dead there on all star weekend. Do not recommend this place at all. Go to cactus club next door. Better service.  Better food."}
{"text":"Went to Reds on a Thursday night for dinner and drinks and we had an awesome time. We sat upstairs and the ambiance was amazing. Had some great white wine that was reasonably priced. My girlfriend had the curry of the day and she loved it. I had the roasted chicken and it tasted like southern fried chicken but it was baked. I had the goat cheese salad which had these toasted almonds which were heavenly. Would go back soon."}
{"text":"Terrible. What a dissapointment. 

I've been to some of the city's top restos... One, Le select, Lasociete, etc. the kind of places you happily drop $200 because the ambiance, service, wine and most importantly the food make it worth it. If you are a fan of those places STAY AWAY from this place.

First off 2/5 for service. The waiter argued with me on whether I should get fries and was very judgemental. I felt uncomfortable. For a place that's set up like a renovated Hemmingways, you'd expect less attitude.

Ambiance 3/5. Too many lights and for a place that empty, too bright.  We were there at 9:30 and the place was LIT up like crazy.

Food: terrible. Awful.

taste1/5. The lobster rolls were bland, the teas was old, tough, chewy and thick. The corn on the rolls was surely from a can. The matchstick fries were like dehydrated hickory sticks spiced wt pepper and still somehow bland. The pasta was like eating plastic. I've made better food at home. The broccoli was not cooked properly and was hard to chew and swallow. The steak was the worse of the night. My partner ordered medium rear and it came back well done. The fries were soggy and the plate had two random grape tomatoes thrown in.  Not cooked, not cut , just randome; as if it was lying around in the kitchen and they decided to throw it on the plate.

The presentation gets 0/5. If I were the chef I'd be embarrassed. How he can put his name to this mess is beyond me. The steak was slapped onto soggy unseasoned fried with the \"tomato juis\" thrown on the plate like it was gravy. Did I me toon the random raw grape tomatoes?

The highlight of the night was the hot sauce they brought me so I could add so e taste to the pasta.

Neither I, nor my partner finished our food. 

The waiter could tell we were upset and comped the rolls and offerd complimentary reisling. But the damage was beyond repair. We came home hungry, $150 short and a Saturday night wasted.

Stay away from the tavern."}
{"text":"Had a bad experience there! Got severe gastritis and nausea hours after eating here. I had ordered Edamame and Pan seared Salmon. In addition to that, the food was not that tasty to begin with. The service was okay. The only thing that was good was the setting. Definitely wouldn't go here again. Food was not worth the $40+ that I paid for it."}
{"text":"So I never have high expectations for the restaurants in the financial district (with the exception of a few..like Canoe)... but this one was a real big disappointment.
This is a prime example of a restaurant catering to the corporate world - teeny tiny portions at ridiculous prices for lunches that are only acceptable if you're expensing on the company's dime.
I ordered the steak salad - which the server said a customer had recently raved to him \"as the best steak salad in Toronto\"... This steak salad is the size of an appetizer. Tiny portion of meat on little bits of hearts of romaine.  It was sad."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday night and it was pretty busy. We were seated on the second floor which seemed a little quieter than the main floor. It wasn't easy to carry out a conversation across the large table however due to the echoing of the noise. The ambiance is nice however, dimly lit.

We ordered the Bangkok nachos to start; they were delicious. The flavour profiles are very bold and satisfies a craving for crunch. I'd highly recommend those. Our drinks took about 20 minutes to arrive and were provided to us complementary due to the timing.

The steak and lobster dish was okay, steak cooked well but the lobster quality was not the greatest. Have had better elsewhere. 

The flour less chocolate cake was very very decadent. Was thick sticky mousse with some fried bananas to give it a different texture and flavour. I wouldn't order again."}
{"text":"Reds food is probably worth three stars, but everything else gets it to the four. Drink selection is good and the menu is creative and has a variety of options which I like. Its less stuffy than many of the other suit places in the area. You don't necessarily get good portions but the food is always satisfying. I'd recommend it as a place to go for after work drinks and maybe a bite."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. I came here on a Friday evening after work. We waited over an hour for our food to arrive, and when it did, it was sub-par. I ordered the ahi tuna beet salad for $22.95. You'd think that with a price tag like that it would consist of more than 4 small pieces of tuna and 4 small chunks of beet. The tuna was very poorly prepared might I add. The salad itself tasted bland. I believe it was supposed to have some sort of vinaigrette. Yeah, didn't taste any of that. It tasted basically like plain arugula. The \"goat cheese\" also had no flavour and to be honest, the taste an texture was more like a mozzarella. But the tuna, now that was where all the flavour was, but not in a good way. Each of the 4 tiny pieces of tuna was crusted in some sort of seasoning that was overpoweringly salty and extremely peppery. I think I downed a glass of water after each bite and to be honest, didn't even touch the fourth piece because the other three left such an unpleasant feeling in my mouth. After we finished eating, it took the waitress about an hour to clear our dishes and bring us the bills.

I came with a group of 10 so they charged us 18% gratuity. I would not have tipped otherwise. My bill came out to be $30, which is ridiculous for the service and quality.

Horrible experience. Go to Cactus Club next door."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, food was okay, but service was horrible (when we ordered a drink it would come 10-15mins later... Took about 10 minutes to get a menu, etc.)"}
{"text":"Start to finish an absolutely fantastic evening! Our server was fantastic and the food was delicious . The chef might pay better attention to cooking the steaks to the correct  requirements as well as to serving it with sides mentioned on the menu. Other than that everything was great!  No greater attention could have been given. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The overall experience at this restaurant was great. We were promptly seated upon arrival with a reservation and given a cozy spot (one of those corner couches) with a view of the bar. The waiter appeared at once with menus and introduced the specials of the day. When taking orders, he also quite patiently explained some of the dishes to one of my colleagues who had trouble deciding. Food arrived fairly quickly, and the portions were much larger than I expected! 

I had the pan-roasted salmon, and while it was a little bit too buttery for my taste, I can't deny that the dish as a whole was very well executed. The flavours of the fish blended wonderfully with the vegetables and the purée was also delicious.

Service was extremely welcoming and friendly right up to the end when we left. Ambience was nice and quiet (the restaurant seemed pretty empty) and suitable for a business lunch. Also, bonus for being accessible in the PATH! :)"}
{"text":"Bobby, the sommelier, treated us like royalty! His recommendations for wine and steak was on point! Hubby and I slayed the 20 oz steak!"}
{"text":"I think this place is pretty good. I've been twice. I've had the lobster guacamole (4/5), chicken tacos (3/5), truffle fries (5/5), sliders (5/5), bangkok nachos (3/5), and calamari (3/5). I really liked the sliders and truffle fries. The sliders had done secret sauce on it, which was super tasty."}
{"text":"Came afterwork for a few drinks and bites.  

I wouldn't say anything stood out as outstanding here, the $6 wine by the glass was a good offering for those looking to drink on a budget.  The red wine is full bodied which I liked. The space is a bit dark, kind of reminded me of Baton Rouge with the heavy leather furniture and deep wood tones.  The food seems to be a couple dollars over priced.  I had the chicken tacos which were good but were about $16 plus additional $4 for a side salad."}
{"text":"3.5

Great ambiance, but a little loud. Tuna salad was very tasty and the truffle Parmesan fries were to die for! BUT chicken carbonara paata was sadly VERY bland and watery despite the promising description and presentation. 

I'd give it a 2nd chance though."}
{"text":"We had booked a reservation for my daughter's birthday. We had passed this place after a Leaf's game and it caught her eye.
Upon arrival, we were taken upstairs, to a very empty second floor. The Maitre'D looked around, puzzled, then took us back downstairs, (group of five getting a grand tour.) There, more puzzled look and went to seat us at an elevated bar type seating. I told her that this was unacceptable, trudged us back up to the top and sat us at a table. Why she couldn't have done this the first time? I have no clue. She did say: \"Don't shoot the messenger.\" At that point, we should have left, but it was cold outside and we were tired and hungry.
We ordered soup to start. It came cold, with a skin on the top. We had it reheated. Soup was slightly less than par, with or without the skin and temperature considered.
For a main, I had the burger. It was a touch better than ok, but the waitress was totally clued out. Hate to put it this way, but this is the kindest I can be. Disorganized? Call it what you like.
The prices are a bit more than midrange. I would expect that to reflect in the service. I think this is more of a bar for drinks after work to meet one's secretary at. There are so many restaurants in this area, I would find it hard to understand why anyone would go here. No attraction what so ever.

{"text":"Came here for dinner with some friends; reception here on yelp seems to be somewhat mixed but I had a good time. 

Food:
We ordered the smoked chicken wings to share; they were tasty, with a nice smoky flavor and crunchy skin, and came with a spicy sauce which was decent, as well as a ranch-style sauce which in my opinion had very little flavor. 
For my entree I ordered the striploin. It was cooked perfectly, tender and juicy when it arrived at the table. The portion was very large, which resulted in me being too full to order a dessert. To accompany my meal our server recommended a nice wine, which tasted fine to me, although my wine-tasting skills are admittedly limited. 
I opted to skip dessert, although my friend ordered the grasshopper parfait which she said was very good. 

Service: 
Hostess looked up our reservation right away and checked our coats, and we were led to our seats promptly. Our server was friendly and attentive, coming to fill our glasses with water, give us menus, and take our orders promptly. No complaints here.

Decor/ambience:
The restaurant is decorated nicely with an upscale feel to it. There's a dining area upstairs, along with a large bar and additional seating on the main level. Some of the light fixtures are made out of wine glasses, which was pretty neat. 

Verdict:
Although somewhat pricey, Reds managed to deliver on good food and service, making it a solid choice to have business lunches, go to happy hour/dinner with coworkers, or to have a nice dressy dinner."}
{"text":"I don't normally like to go to the financial district.. I don't fit in... ever... BUT alas, I read a few great reviews so I decided to have a girls night here. 

One thing that I noticed immediately as I walked in was how friendly everyone was. It wasn't the pretentious vibe I normally get when my out of place persona enters any place in the district. Not only the place, but the people were warm and inviting. They were quick to tell me they just underwent a big overhaul and from what I could see, they did a bang up job. Beautiful decor, dim lighting, warm and cozy.

We were seated upstairs and our server, Michael, was so helpful with picking out our wine choice for the evening. He recommended some great shared plates to try and we spent the night laughing over an amazing cheese / meat plate, mussels, chicken wings, Brussel sprouts.. and even later had the calamari (AMAZING) and some sort of tot... I can't remember . .everything was just so good!

After dinner we went downstairs for more drinks and again, same quality service that we received from Michael, with another server.

The only thing keeping me from giving this a 5 star would be the price.. things were a little rich for my blood however, I know this is a product of where the restaurant is located."}
{"text":"Fun wine tasting experience but very pricy! They also give you cheese plates with the tasting but it's not part of their up front costs and its about $100 two plates!! So be careful. Now I know for next time . 

I will be back because the wine and food are great! The Tandoori Grilled Chicken Salad is one if the best salads I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"This is a beautiful restaurant. It has two floors and all in cedar wood. Great wine selection and some good beer's on tap. Service was fantastic, everyone goes the extra mile. I was here with a large group for drinks and appetizers. The crab cakes were amazing, mushroom truffle was excellent. Some of the best sliders I ever ate. I can't emphasize enough how nice this place is. I will we back for a full dinner for sure."}
{"text":"Great looking venue attracted us here for a casual drink and some food on an early Saturday evening. Service, even though friendly. is extremely slow. The place was empty we had to wait for the first round of drinks for about 15 minutes. Server rarely approached and some requests were not accommodated. Food is below average, ahi tuna salad is extremely disappointing and lamb shank even though it wasn't bad was lacking... something. The only thing that was cool and fun was the gin and tonic selection and some of them were actually really good.
Prices too high for such a laid back place especially considering the bad service and bad food."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our night at Reds!

I was with a group of ladies for a bachelorette dinner. We had reservations in the private wine room area. The restaurant itself it beautiful and classy, really well lit, and comfortable at the same time. I love that you can go in dressed up and you don't stand out. 

The service, from the greeting at the door until the check, was fabulous. Our server did a really good job from start to finish, making thoughtful suggestions and appearing at the table at just the right times. Everyone was friendly and easy going without being too casual.

Between the 8 of us we covered a good portion of the menu and no one had any complaints. We started with the butcher board and tater tots - I highly recommend the tots, they were fabulous. 

The entrees change regularly so I won't go into specifics, but everyone was pleased with their meal. 

We split all 3 desserts between us - carrot cake, apple tart, and a grasshopper parfait. All 3 were delicious, but the grasshopper parfait was especially popular. 

We had a great time at Reds and they did a good job of making sure we did! I am looking forward to returning with my husband one night to see what the experience is like without 7 other ladies fawning over the handsome wait staff!"}
{"text":"This is a tough one, between 3 and 4 stars for me but because of the lack of really good restaurants in the financial district I'll give it a 4.

Went at an off-time, around 3:45 pm on a Wednesday.  Patio is gorgeous, it was shady but towards the end I got some sun.  Service was friendly and I didn't feel like we were treated any \"less than\", even though we were wearing casual summer clothing and were clearly not of the business-variety.  

My drink (orange blossom) was really good, the cheeseburger was well cooked and seasoned.  I liked the fries a lot too.  Expensive-ish -- but reasonable for the location and the vibe.  I'd be back if I needed a place to eat in that area, but it's not a destination in and of itself."}
{"text":"Great layout here. Very funky layout and lighting . Great location one of the best for sure, drinks were delicious food was awesome. Service was amazing, great for events ."}
{"text":"Wasn't anything special. It is more like the TGIF chain . The food wasn't anything special note the service. Good for grabbing a quick lunch maybe. Seems more of a beewery than a tavern ."}
{"text":"So I had dinner here couple weeks back for my anniversary. The restaurant's location is perfect because it is very close from my work. I was sitted on the second floor and it wasn't too busy because it was during the week. The sitting was nice and comfy, and decorations were pretty cool. My wife had steak and I ordered a pasta. The steak was very good but the pasta was definitely not worth the money. Just based on food I ordered, I'd give maybe a 3, but overall service was good so I'm bumping this to a 4."}
{"text":"Potentially somewhere I'd come for a glass of wine, but I wouldn't highly recommend it for dinner.  The mushroom broth appetiser was bland and totally under-seasoned.

The mussels in white wine were good (but who can screw up mussels?) but nothing to write Yelp about.

The final nail in the coffin for me was the service, which was distracted to say the least - the server forgot to bring our wine. He apologised and offered to remove the coffee and desserts from the bill - which he then forgot to do at the end of the meal.

Also bear in mind this is not a quiet cosy location - its quite noisy - the background music is up high and the sound for the talking carries in that double volume space."}
{"text":"Located at the financial district, inside the First Canadian Place facing the Adelaide street, this restaurant is a high-class eatery. The main area adapts an open concept style and takes advantage of the outdoor sunlight to illuminate the entire restaurant. As a result, the restaurant creates a very pleasant environment to eat.

As expected with restaurants located in the financial district, the food, wine and beer are rather expensive. However, if you have the extra cash, it is recommended to order the sticky ribs appetizer for starters. The sticky ribs come in 4 pieces, makes it very easy to share with others.

I ordered the carbonara chicken and the flourless chocolate cake for dessert. The carbonara chicken is tasty and comes with penne pasta. Sauce in the dish is flavourful and the dish comes with smokey bacon with a poached egg. The chocolate cake was very sweet and it is basically made of complete milk chocolate mousse. 

The best thing about this restaurant is that there is a shuffleboard inside the restaurant. If you don't know what a shuffleboard is, you should google it."}
{"text":"This is a really great restaurant. I love the relaxed vibe you get while eating and drinking good stuff. Great looking people too."}
{"text":"Love the interior of this spot.  Service is decent at the bar.  Handful of ladies, but the drinks make what's around better."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a bunch of my girlfriends and heard good things about this place.  Unfortunately, after arriving I was disappointed.  Upon walking in, the restaurant was completely empty for a Saturday night.  Don't get me wrong, the ambiance of the restaurant was lovely and sophisticated.  But I only saw a couple of tables occupied by the patio so I figured that's where the girls were.  I was late meeting up with them and I wasn't approached by the waiter for anything to drink for a good 15-20 minutes.  Luckily, I was only there to get a drink, but again, I did not get a glass of water to start.  Once I ordered my drink, the food arrived for the group.  Everything that they ordered was delicious.  Obviously, I'm going to sneak a bite of the food!  They had the Steamed Edamame, Thai Lettuce Wraps (which I did not particularly enjoy), Crispy Roasted Chicken and the Roasted Pork Tenderloin and Potato Gnocchi.  After everyone finished their food, I asked the waiter where the washroom was, and he literally responded with 'well if you follow that guy walking, you'll find the washrooms'.. Ummm okay? You work here and you can't instruct me on where to go to get to the washrooms? After returning from the washroom, we wanted to order a round of drinks for the table.  We waited and waited and waited until finally 20-30 minutes later, the waiter takes our orders for drinks.  Then we had to wait another 15-20 minutes for our drinks to arrive.  After trying to wave down the waiter to get our bills, we decided we'd all go to the bar to pay as we were in a rush to leave.  I didn't understand why the restaurant was so empty on a weekend and why it takes forever to get the waiters attention.  The food was delicious but the service was terrible.. Depending on how I feel I may or may not come back.  But let me warn you in advance, if you're in a rush for dinner, do not even bother with Red's.  Red flags everywhere!"}
{"text":"Awesome service.  Came in late night and sat on patio.
Sangria and hummus platter were perfect.
Very nice wait staff!"}
{"text":"I visited Reds for an early weekend happy hour. I love the decor - it makes me want to order a scotch. 

The Bangkok nachos are fantastic - some of the best nachos I've had. They stay crunchy and have just enough heat. If you're not hungry enough for a meal but are looking to munch on something, order these!"}
{"text":"Foods okay depending on what you order. We got the Bangkok Nachos (4 stacked pieces in total) and Sweet Potato Fries. The fries came with two sauces. One sauce was this special mango curry sauce and this tasted amazing! Hence the three stars. 

Price, on the other hand, will make its patrons turn RED, as true to their name ofc. Small plates? More like small bites! This menu section charges big and gives you small. Your best bet is go big and go large here. Skip to the mains and order their burgers, sandwiches, or steaks; all are worth your investment.

Note: They TAX customers ON TOP OF TIPS. Seriously, is this even legal? Tips is an automatic 18% for any large groups (6+)

Won't return in the near future."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous steak dinner here last night. Amazing, friendly service and great food!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience! Grace was our waitress and she was absolutely friendly, charming and conversational. She made our time there so enjoyable, that the manager came out to say hello as well! 

I had the grilled cheese lobster sandwich with a Cesar salad. It was mouth-wateringly amazing. 

Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert was pretty bad."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of visiting the newly revamped Red's Wine Tavern a couple weeks ago alongside my girlfriend. I had been before, but it was many years ago and I remember my experience being very different.

They've done an incredible job of changing up the space. Long gone are the days of the white table cloths that gave the restaurant a conservative fine dining feel. The decor is now very eclectic and overall the restaurant has a very warm and welcoming vibe to it, both upstairs and down. 

The food itself was very appetizing. We started off sharing the Sauvignon Blanc Braised mussels (18.50) which came with slices of delicious garlic buttered baguette. We also split the RWT Caesar (10.25), which just may have been the best caesar salad I've ever had in this city.

For our mains I had the Swordfish Special (Market Price), which I believe was the catch of the day, so needless to say it was incredibly fresh.

The lady had the Pork Chop Entree (24.95) which she found tasty, but nothing write home about.

We drank one of the Malbecs (I forget which one), but with so much on the wine list I can't imagine somebody not finding something to suit their taste.

Overall it was a great experience and I look forward to my next visit. There were many things on the \"shareables\" portion of the menu that I didn't get a chance to try!"}
{"text":"Great after work watering hole but I had lunch here and it was fantastic!  Good service, I had eaten here before and was underwhelmed but something changed and it is now surprisingly good."}
{"text":"REDS WINE TAVERN has gone through a few changes in the course of the past year or so.  First a complete overhaul from being Reds Bistro & Wine Bar, replacing its white linen table cloths with a modern tavern look and Dustin Gallagher heading up the kitchen.  Since his departure, Michael Hunter has been running the show.

REDS 2.0 is definitely a much more fun place to unwind - no doubt a lot of high-strung investment bankers and white collars end up there after work to grab a drink and destress.  The shuffleboard serves as a good distraction for those up for a little healthy competition.  The tall windows which look out onto the covered patio let in a lot of natural lighting but my favourite displays are the lighting fixtures made from repurposed wine bottles and wine glasses, and the display cases of vintage flasks and Barbie dolls in the hallway leading to the washrooms.

The cocktail menu features classic favourites such as a stiff Old Fashioned and a varied selection of wines (both domestic and international).   The Ginger Schnapp (pictured right) is my personal favourite - a vodka-based cocktail with apple and cranberry juice and peach schnapps topped off with ginger beer and plum bitters.  An uber refreshing drink for a summer day.

The menu is composed of sharing plates as well as a healthy selection of seafood featuring catches of the day, mussels and the decadent lobster and avocado Cobb salad.  The salad is topped with a perfectly poached 63 degree egg with generous chunks of lobster meat, bacon and croutons. With all its rich ingredients, the light dressing is just perfect.

The Beef Tartar gets a little bit of added attention as it is mixed table-side by your server to your selected degree of spiciness (we were perfectly content with a level 4).

The Sauvignon Blanc Braised Mussels are simple but bursting of pure, sweet flavour from the natural juices of the mussels spruced up with some herbes de provence, shallots and tomato + garlic confit.  The crostini are buttery and crisp - leave them in a little longer to really soak up the juices.  It's good to know that REDS knows their cookware too - it's served in a Staub mussel pot.

We also grab the Cheeseburger, with a duo of Morbier and Fontina, house made ketchup (which I don't usually like, but this one is quite good), mustard wedged between an eggy brioche bun with a side of house made pickles and fries.

Veering away from the more traditional American/British fare is a Pork Vindaloo daal, Basmati and chopped salad with a ginger vinaigrette.  I prefer naan as my choice of carb for its absorption factor!  Tender pieces of pork with just the right amount of heat - this, I'm told, is a REDS favourite.

We manage to leave some room for dessert - and when the Flourless (Dark) Chocolate Cake arrives at the table, I am glad we did.  Not starchy or dry like your usual flourless chocolate cakes, the texture was closer to a mousse and topped with candied pistachios and vanilla tuille. Opt out of the tuille and it is a indulgent gluten-free option.  I don't know anyone who would say no.  This also happens to be chef Hunter's favourite dessert.

{"text":"I love the ambiance and decor of this place. Considering it's in the heart of financial district, this place is a great place to have a more intimate setting if you're grabbing a bite/drink after work.

The servers were very knowledgeable and accommodating. The food, however, was just okay. I found it a bit too salty and buttery for my liking. They have an extensive wine list and a great selection of beer on tap."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Felt a little underdressed in jeans but it was fine. Great value for meals. Ordered a steak and it came perfectly cooked! Drinks are good - ask if there is any promos. Only thing I would suggest is some sour dough bread while waiting for your entree! But perfect meal !! Good times. Also if u get a steak ask for peppercorn sauce to go with it!!"}
{"text":"The lamb salad was delicious! And the calamari were really good! The 2nd best I've had... But really good!"}
{"text":"I don't know what to say. I have never given a rate that low. But the fact that we were at the restaurant for full 15 minutes without one single server coming to give us a menu or water says enough about the service. No one even bother to ask us why we left,  nor said goodbye. 
It's not a busy night tonight. We arrived there at 10pm and there were fewer than 10 tables.
This one star is purely for decor. If Yelp has half star I would've given a half star."}
{"text":"I enjoy this nice casual dining spot. My favourite is the Lobster Guacamole and chips. My second favourite is the shrimp Ravioli and a nice Chardonnay. 
They also grill a good steak."}
{"text":"Red's is one of those places where the food both tastes and looks amazing. The presentation of both the food and drinks is impeccable. 

For starters we shared a beetroot humous which came with various veggies and pita bread crisps to dip. It was excellent to the very last bite.

For our main I went for the butter chicken served with naan. Considering this isn't a dedicated Indian restaurant I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was, and it far surpassed my expectations. Another person in my group went for the curry of the day, a Madras which I was jealous of as it looked fantastic.  My group also tried the steak which was, I'm told, cooked to absolute perfection.

For desert we shared the brownie and the apple pie which is baked fresh each day shortly before lunch and dinner. 

All in all I can't recommend this place enough. Beautiful decor, even better food, fantastic service."}
{"text":"Loved this place so much we dined here twice while in Toronto.
Great food, nice wine, fantastic service, comfortable atmosphere inside and out, and reasonable prices.
Cheers!"}
{"text":"A few of my friends wanted to have some drinks after their company party. We wanted to go to the restaurant next door after hearing good things but they were full. So we decided not to walk too far and landed next door. We were thinking that it was not too busy and service should be quick. The first waitress was pleasant and then she told us that another server will be assigned to our table.

What a terrible mistake of picking this place! Service for some beers were the worse I ever had. It was so slow that we waited more than 20 minutes. Drinks were reasonable for the real estate that the restaurant occupied. Essentially, you are getting about 2/3 of a pint for the price of a full pint. We never tried the food as we were not in the mood. However, given the service level, I doubt we will be trying anything from there.

Not sure if it was an off night where lots of holiday parties were going on but it should be the possible regular clientele that the restaurant should be catering to as repeat business is where the money is made."}
{"text":"We had an official lunch booked at reds
There were approximately 30 people.
They have a private area which is nice
But I was very disappointed in the service. No one came to ask us if we wanted pepper with our soup which I really needed and found strange.

I started off with mushroom soup which was terrible. My co-worker ordered ceaser  salad which was a few pieces  of iceberg lettuce, she did not 
Enjoy it at all.
My main course was Salmon Risotto and was delicious. The fish was cooked perfectly. 4 stars for this
My co-worker ordered Tandoori chicken I could see the chicken pieces was overdone. The lentil salad with it was old and had a rotten smell, and the green salad had no dressing. This was a 1 star meal.
What saved the day for her was the lemon cheese cake which was truly delicious. Good to the last bite.
 Overall food is hit or miss and service terrible."}
{"text":"Went to reds for the second time, always a nice visit. Food could use some flavour, but it's fresh and really healthy. The prices are good and the service was great the first time, not bad the second. The problem that I had was how fast they brought out dishes. I am not in a race, it's Saturday night, and it's not fast food (or not supposed to be). Their dishes are very large, especially the appetizers. We had the lobster salad (very good, fresh, but pain and lacking a lot of flavour), the dips (amazing!!!), and the lamb shank (pretty good, but again very plain). 

I will definitely be back when im craving good, healthy food. Next time, I will tell them to bring it out very slowly so we can digest the appetizer before the meal comes."}
{"text":"Being located in the Financial district, I had some expectations but this place was a let down.

It has a great bar if your looking to catch up with  friends or watch the game and the $8 gin and tonics on Friday nights are hard to beat. But be warned, I found the drinks to be tasty but watered down as well. I couldn't even taste the gin.

The food however was worst. The food was dry and over priced for what you get. I had the burger which was small but dry and definitely wasn't worth the $16. there are plenty of places to have a good meal for a more budget friendly price. I would walk the extra 5 mins to get to the keg instead.

Final verdict, Come for the drinks but leave before you get hungry."}
{"text":"I was looking for a low key and intimate wine bar and i found one right in the middle of the financial district....a
The endless list of vintage wines makes it all the more exciting.  Definitely a place for wine lovers.  The new ambience and decor is lovely and endless amounts of WINE DECOR, the Wine bottle Chandelier is beautiful.  The waiters were very knowledgable and provided us some assistance wgen we couldnt decide which bottle to order.  The prices were no surprise, its quite a pricey place if you loose track of what you're ordering. But nonetheless a great place for a date to a wine bar. :) 

The food was great, excellent, but i felt they should have had more choices for small bites espeicially if you're just stopping for wine. 

I will be there again!"}
{"text":"Came here for a corporate lunch on a Friday, because Cactus Club next door was full. Did not have to wait. I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time this past Friday evening with a friend for a drink. From start to finish everyone was great. The hostess was lovely and let us grab a spot at the bar. We were checked in on by probably 3 different people at the bar, so we were really well taken care of! The atmosphere is also fantastic. The lighting and decor is beautiful, whoever designed the space Killed it. Thanks so much for the hospitality!"}
{"text":"Great food and great decorations. Definitely the nicest bathroom I have used in a long time.

Portion sizes could be better. And the drinks specials could be more plentiful.

I will return.:)"}
{"text":"Took a chance on this place after the wait was unreasonable at a restaurant down the street. Wonderfully surprised. My daughters fillet and my seared ahi/ beet salad were perfectly delish ! Great wine list and excellent service !"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review on this place. I'm been here many time and it never disappoints me. I've been here with a big group of people and with just a couple of friends and the service has always been good. The food is also on point, although some dishes are better than others. I really like the sirloin appetizer and their steaks are great as well. 
They have a great selection of wines but it runs on the expensive side. 
Price wise it usually comes to 50-100 per person for a lift meal with drinks."}
{"text":"Came here specifically for the lobster rolls, and guess what, that's the only dish they ran out of!

But that's not why I'm giving Reds two stars. Unfortunately I wasn't terribly impressed with my meal: mushroom soup (fresh but needed way more flavour) and salmon, which was just okay. To be fair, the mussels a friend ordered were quite yummy and another friend really enjoyed his fried chicken. Yet the pork entree and the tandoori chicken salad were both a thumbs down.

I'd recommend this place for happy hour since the bar area is quite sexy (share the lobster rolls with friends, Toronto Life says they're great!)...but I'd dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"Average quality food, i can't say the food was not good but it wasn't great either. They have a great selection of wines and the ambiance is relax. We tried a few appetizers, the kale salad was very good...i was in the mood for a steak and the only choice available was the \"steak frites\".  Prices are reasonable and average portions."}
{"text":"Reds Wine Tavern is a great place to enjoy wine with friends or with a significant other for date night. The interior design has a tavern theme of wood and leather throughout the place, making the place look trendy yet elegant at the same time. I came here with my boyfriend on a Saturday night after dinner and the place was almost empty which we didn't mind because the atmosphere was very relaxing and comfortable. We ordered two glasses red wine and a small cheeseboard of Brie and Mountainoak Truffle cheese. The Brie had a delicious creamy texture that spread over the toast smoothly, and the Mountainoak had a nice strong taste. 

We enjoyed our time here because it was a lot different than other taverns/bars we've been to and it was a nice escape from a busy crowd. I am planning on visiting Reds Wine Tavern soon to try out their food for dinner and, of course, to eat more delicious cheese! I recommend this place to all wine and cheese lovers in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here a few years ago for lunch and thought it was decent. My friend and I had just started working on Bay Street at the time (young professionals) and we were mortified when we were charged $14 for water. Haha. Guess we've come a long way since. Took my boyfriend here for his birthday last weekend. It was a Saturday night and not busy at all. Had no issues getting seated right away. We got a couple of drinks which were decent and ordered our mains. I got the chicken which was really dry and kind of hard to eat. My boyfriend had the shrimp ravioli which he liked.  We shared an apple pie for dessert which was good but nothing to write home about. All around decent meal, decent service but for the price you're paying I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Reds is a multistory classy bar/restaurant that attracts plenty of the after-work crowd from the area. I came after work on a Thursday, and both floors were busy with people chatting with a drink in hand. Drinks and dinner turned into dessert instead, and when life takes you in that direction, order the homestyle brownie. It came with two squares of brownie topped with bruled orange slices on top. A large dollop of vanilla mousse and two chucks of sponge toffee completed the dish. The brownie paired well with both the orange slices and the vanilla mousse, but the sponge toffee didn't add much to the experience except stick my jaw together for a while. A delicious treat when you are craving a hit of chocolate. 

Service was attentive and friendly but unobtrusive. They seem well versed with dealing with large crowds and sporadic orders that trickle in randomly throughout the night. The price point is admittedly higher, but that is expected for the location and the level of service. A great option when looking for a place that takes good care of a larger crowd!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  I love the wine and love the wine expert that comes to the table and helps you pick the best wine.  Food is pretty decent too.  Worth the price."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time at Reds. My steak frites was perfectly cooked, my lobster rolls were good and the lobster guacamole was good. The decor, ambiance an service was great. Overall I had a great time and no hiccups. Expect good but not spectacular. I give it a 4 for the overall experience."}
{"text":"Got the steak meat pie and it was the best pie i've had. Different from a classic chicken pot pie, comes with a salad on the side. Went for a work lunch and the atmosphere was a bit loud (as expected for a typical downtown lunch rush). Overall would go again!"}
{"text":"Food is quite good and nice variety. Well prepared - seasoning and choice interesting but spot on. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"This place is an awesome place to go for drinks after work whether it's with co-workers or friends. 

If you're a sports fan, they'll usually have the game on and the place is ecstatic when the Maple Leafs, Raptors and Blue Jays play. When it's the offseason or when the weather's nice, there will be DJs spinning some tunes out on the patio. If it's 18+ degrees outside, then it's perfect to just enjoy the vibes.

The vibe itself is excellent and the drinks are moderately priced for what you would expect from Toronto. The food is also great; I got the steak frites one time and a surf & turf another time. They were cooked perfectly! 

I think where they fall off is in their service. They don't tend to come around as often as you'd like when you need a refill or if you need the check. Not bad if you plan to hang out all night but crappy if it's a work night and you need you need to catch a train home. 

Overall a great spot to go after work. I'd say at least 75% of the customers are working professionals in the city on weekdays. Best advice is to not go in there with a set schedule in mind...go in there and just let the good times flow."}
{"text":"Not bad for mid range food at a decent price... Better than Vertical, but way too stuffy... The price point makes it a good option though... But let's face it, it's not somewhere where you want to linger..."}
{"text":"I came here for a work lunch a few months ago- long story short: the decor was fun, food was bad, service was bad and there are many better places in the area.

My lamb salad was a mess- a low quality cut of meat that was overcooked, burnt and so tough it could have passed for jerky. I was only given a butter knife. The portion of the salad was small and the ingredients weren't fresh. I would have sent it back if not for already wasting so much time here already. Our server had a really indifferent attitude and was missing for a lot of the lunch service. We spent more time at the restaurant than we wanted. Prices (location, ambiance, service, and quality considered) are high for what you get.

I really don't understand the recommendations that I got to come here but I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great place, creative interior design, friendly and wine savvy staff, great selection of wines. We tried the butcher board and tater tots and they were great! Another yum appetizer is Lobster Guacamole. Enjoy it with a glass of red, and you'll be rather pleased. Wish the restaurant had more appetizer options, but otherwise a great place, even if on the pricey side."}
{"text":"The actual rating is \"0\" stars but you can't enter that.  After 30 years of fine dining and being involved in the business in my \"earlier\" years, I'm compelled to write this review as it was the worst service experience in recent, in fact all of those years.  I created a special weekend for my girlfriend's birthday and after 2 evenings of terrific dining, I asked her to pick the venue for her special day.  She chose this restaurant based on her previous 3 dining experiences of which I was a part of the last time she ate there.  I recommended other establishments but she chose to come here.  I informed the restaurant that it was a birthday celebration.  Anyhow, the evening was a comedy of service errors the likes of which I've never seen in all those years of dining.  We should have been forewarned by the fact that we were shocked at how dead the place was on a prime Saturday night.  No need for reservations!  We were sat in a very drafty area (in a practically empty restaurant) and asked to move to a more comfortable area.  To make a long story short, we were rushed from the get go, the service staff was incredibly poorly trained and the responses from the rookie manager were astounding.  For instance, after our meal, and placing an order for desert, the server removed everything including our napkins.  When dessert was served, I asked for a couple of napkins.  He then returned with a choice of cloth napkins or 2 doilies.  We, of course, chose the napkins.... anyway, later in the evening with discussing the issues we had with dinner we pointed this out.  Apparently, now you get to have a \"green\" choice of doilies or napkins so this was perfectly natural and in line with the philosophy of the restaurant.  I was so aghast at this response because the obvious green practice would be to allow us to use the same napkin for the entire meal!  The manager is a rookie who freely explained that his sister was the former GM.  After hearing this and the plethora of excuses he provided for the poor service, including \"we are focusing on providing lunch for local banking district and moving away from the fine evening dining service\" was just incredible. He offered his card to see if he could make our FUTURE dining experience more acceptable....  When we got the cheque, it was for the full amount.  I paid the full $200+ amount and tipped the waiter as clearly he was not properly trained for the job and was way over his head with regard to understanding quality service for a $$$ restaurant.  We saw no hide, hair or card from the manager after our discussion.
This is not the same restaurant any more.  They didn't even make an effort to acknowledge my girlfriend's birthday in any way though told in the reservation.
So, don't ruin a special evening by eating at Red's, especially on a Saturday, because as the manager explained... \"Saturdays are bad for us\".  Indeed, this Saturday was incredibly bad for us!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here yesterday . Love their chicken tacos and mushroom soup.
I was also there after work last week . The Lobster guacamole is amazing ... also had truffle fries which were good but I've had better !"}
{"text":"Went here on a group outing from work as our department Christmas dinner. 

Reception at the front desk was warm and I was led upstairs to the group by the friendly girl on reception. We had been placed in a semi-private section upstairs with sliding doors that could be closed for extra privacy. Nice view of Adelaide St through huge windows so great potential for people watching!

They were pretty quick to take the orders. We had a set menu for $58. I ordered the chevre salad, tenderloin and carrot cake. The tenderloin was described as coming with roasted brussels sprouts and blue cheese fritters, heirloom tomato relish and worcestershire dip. I asked about getting some salad with it and was told no. I also enquired about some gelato with my carrot cake and was told it was either/or.

Bread was cold and not too exciting. It came with butter though which was nice. I'm Irish. It's what I was raised on! Starter was delicious. Beautiful caramelized chevre and a tasty salad. The entree was OK. The tenderloin was medium rare and tender. Not a huge portion. I didn't think the tomato relish went particularly well with it though. The handful of brussels sprouts were kind of bland and hard so I think they were undercooked. The 2 blue cheese fritters were probably the nicest thing on the plate. Would be lovely as bar food! I sampled some risotto too which was quite nice. I wouldn't bother to order it though. 

Dessert choices were grasshopper parfait, carrot cake or cheese platter. I opted for carrot cake even though I thought the choices were pretty limited and poor! It was kind of a deconstructed carrot cake in 4 squares with some frosting on the plate, a drizzle of icing and some coconut swirls. Some pear was chopped on top. The cake itself was lovely and moist. It would be a lovely afternoon coffee cake. There was too little frosting though, the pear didn't go with it and the coconut was unnecessary. As a dessert after my Christmas night out it was a fail. The consensus on the cheese platter was also negative-my boss wondered when one chunk of cheese began to constitute a platter?

Service was pleasant and attentive without being obtrusive. The wines were good.

Ultimately, I think it would be a nice place to have the shareable menu at the bar. I wouldn't particularly rate it as a place to visit for the food. It's like they've tried to make bar food gourmet and edgy, but instead just ended up with a meal that was neither here nor there. I'm still bitter about the carrot cake-particularly since I emailed ahead and they told me I could have gelato! The question I suppose you have to ask after being brought out for a free meal is whether or not you'd go back and spend your hard-earned cash on it. I might consider the shareables etc, but for dinner (especially considering that the tenderloin is priced at $32.95)? No."}
{"text":"I was not too impressed. It was another after work gathering and I ordered the Ahi Tuna beat salad which sounded different. It actually worked, but they had messed it up by making the vegetables sooo salty and the tuna so peppery that it was singing my tongue. Too bad because it really would have worked. I will replicate this combination at home (without the mega doses of salt and pepper). I am not sure the four small pieces of tuna were worth the $25 though.
Wine was OK.
My male co-workers said they are not too impressed by the waitresses because the waitresses at Earls and Moxies have shorter skirts so they don't want to come back, but I thought the waitresses were actually really nice and polite which is a good thing. We might not come back (because of the messed up food and long skirts lol) but I made sure we tip well because the waitresses were personable and cared. Oh, it is way too loud.."}
{"text":"Excellent food and drink selection. Went for my sisters birthday, the staff (we had Brüno as a server) were very friendly and knowledgeable on everything we inquired about. Food arrived in a timely manner. Atmosphere was very nice on the second floor but it was Friday night and the place downstairs had turned into a very loud semi-club. So if you're looking for a nice upscale place to dine on the weekend I would suggest other options just because it was quite loud and difficult to make conversation over. Otherwise, fantastic."}
{"text":"First time I was in the Reds at Adelaide Street. I was several times in the one at Yonge St. The Menu is comparable I was missing some food - and the quality is really good and for sharable food Reds is one of the best spots to go I know. It was Friday night after 9pm - service was a little slow - for the carrot cake we had to wait more than 20 minutes - but it was worth it. A DJane was playing Music and we were sitting in the bar area - so it was quite laud.m but ok. I remarked they have a really nice patio - so getting warmer now this could be the place to be."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and was very excited because the ambiance was so great.  Unfortunately from the moment I stepped in to when I left it was sub par and a big let down.  Walking in was awkward since it's the Dj (a man that has headphones on and no interest to answer anymore seating question aka not his job) so I b-lines it for the bar where there was plenty of room so I grabbed a seat and when the bartender finally came around only because I was directly in front of his POS he was put out that I was staring at him wanting to be serviced.  I ordered a Moscow Mule (a go to drink of mine) and a Lamb Salad, the drink was not good and the lamb was a poor piece of meat of which I only had a butter knife to cut it with.  The bartender never came back even though I was in front of the POS and never checked in on me.  Fortunately I was able to flag someone down to pay my tab and leave.  

Sadly enough as cool looking at this place was it was a horrible experience and I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"I visited Reds today for lunch with a few coworkers. This was my second time visiting and it didn't dissapoint!

The good..
- Great selection of food, the menu is smaller than some bit the food is just delicious!
- I had the Cobb salad with chicken and it was deeeelish!
- the decor is gorgeus and space and staff unpretentious..unlike a spot next door let's call it  shmactus shlub!
- easy to make reservations online
- usually have tables as they have ample seating
- great wine selection 
- in houae freshly made dessert special
- servers are great and staff so attentive!

The bad...
- pricey!!!!
- my salad had a big chicken breath plopped on top...how about shredding it for a $18 salad?

Verdict...
I'll definitely visit again for a lunch or dinner outing!"}
{"text":"Soooo 'hoity toity' but nothing to brag about is how I would rate Reds. Came here for dinner it was extremely packed on the ground floor so we were taken on the second floor. I ordered tandoori chicken salad for $19 dollars and the piece of chicken that came with the salad was soooo small that I needed a magnifying glass to find it...ENOUGH SAID!!!  extremely over priced and tasteless!!"}
{"text":"Ambience, service and convenience get the 3 stars. The food and price most certainly don't. 

I've been here three times with my group from work since they renovated. First, it is WAY too loud to have a conversation at the long tables unless the person is right beside you or across from you. It's bad enough that the crowd noise carries but the too loud music amplified the problem. 

Second, the prices. My friend paid $22 including tax and tip for her drink. It was a Kir Royale but still. Even le societe in Yorkville isn't that pricey. 

For sharing food. The matchstick potatoes are meh, the chicken wings are HORRIBLE slimy things. When I ordered them the last time I was there I could not convince anyone at my table to take them off my hands. My chicken wings and glass of wine that night came to $40 with tax and tip. The only food I found worthwhile is the Lobster Guacamole but it comes with too few chips to truly be a \"shareable\" as they have it on the menu. For my wine, lobster Guacamole and my partner's crab and soda last night it was close to $50. 

Last night was my breaking point for this place. We have been going there because its convenient, it is easier to get a table for a large group on a Thursday/Friday. But since I couldn't even really socialize due to noise, followed by paying $50 for something I then had to follow with a dinner, it just isn't worth it anymore. Bye bye Reds"}
{"text":"The food and service were both excellent. The atmosphere was also great. The food was reasonably priced, however, the bar was quite expensive. My friend and I spent upwards of $18 per glass of wine."}
{"text":"The waitress was funny, the food was great.. I had truffle fries and a veggie burger.  I especially enjoyed the wine  but not the Canada whiskey drink -- stick to the wine cellar list. Perfect spot for groups or date night."}
{"text":"This is not \"fine dining\", it's more like a Ruth's Chris type experience. The menu is set, as in rigid plastic printing bound in pleather, so I'd imagine it's quite predictable but with no variation for years. That said, it offers a wide selection and comes across as a kitchen that makes some effort to put out food worth coming back for. I had the chicken Carbonara and it was pretty good, not great, and h-u-g-e. Easily a dinner you can split with your petite wife, then enjoy salad or dessert. The wine list is extensive but rather expensive - though I found this to be the case everywhere in Toronto. On Tuesdays after 5pm you can order their sparkling bottles at half-price so that's what I did - a Prosseco to pair with a creamy sauce, not terrible. The waiter was very kind and happily talked to me about buying retail wines in Toronto and giving me some good tips and directions. The atmosphere is a bit on the loud side, perhaps catering more to the business and younger (= 30-something) crowds. Not a great value - prices are high for the quality - but not a bad value either. If you are thinking you are scared off by the noise, there is a section upstairs with about eight tables that is somewhat blocked off from the rest of the restaurant and is noticeably quieter, and has a nice view. It's a perfectly acceptable place for a business dinner with any size party."}
{"text":"Great wine selection and the lamb shrank is very well paired with green beans n creamy mash potatoes which reduce the lamb strong flavor :) n the carrot cake is the best .... Love it"}
{"text":"I've been to Red's quite a few times but this is my first review of Red's.  It's a nice place to eat in the downtown Financial district.  Food was always great when I came.  I took away one star since they place is extremely loud and all the tables are extra close together so you can hear people's conversations and you have to scream to be heard.  The menu changed a few times I was there. I loved their prime rib sandwich with the dipping sauce but they took that off the menu a few years ago.  I've also had their lobster grilled cheese sandwich it's soooo good.  Also their roasted chicken entree is great as well.  The menu has a wide variety so it appeals to everyone. This time around I was on a diet so I had their salmon and kale quinoa salad.  It was light and delicious not really filing for a foodie like me.  The portion is small.  Hence is why I'm on a diet! Lol it was delicious. The salmon was moist with the crispy skin on top and the salad dressing was the perfect amount.  You can't go wrong coming here. But be warned it's loud when it gets packed!"}
{"text":"I wasn't terribly impressed with this place. We were looking for someplace to grab a drink and apps - this was not it. The apps are overpriced - $10 for a very small bowl of sweet potato fries. Beer is about $7-$8 per glass, but it's nothing spectacular and regular drinks are about $10-$13 each. Be prepared to spend a lot and not be terribly satisfied."}
{"text":"We visited on a Saturday night around 6PM, and we were expecting to fight the crowds. Luckily for us, the long weekend seemed to have sent them away, because the place was really quiet. Great for a little date night. The staff were really friendly, and the service was super fast. We both loved to Bangkok nachos and our desserts (homemade apple pie + lemon cheesecake), but thought the Nova Scotia guac with lobster was way overpriced for what you got --- though the chips were delicious.

Would definitely recommend, and plan to go again!"}
{"text":"One of the best things about this place is the extensive menu. A lot of the financial district restaurants have a really small menu and it could get difficult to find something you want to eat... But that's not a problem at Reds. If you're looking for a lounge-type of decor and atmosphere, ask to be seated upstairs when you make reservations. This should also help with the noise complaints that some reviewers have because I didn't have a problem with the noise upstairs.

Started off with the calamari that was served with a tomato aioli (a tomato-mayo dipping sauce) - the sauce added a different taste to the normal mayo sauces which I thought was great. Had the Low Country Fried Chicken and upgraded the regular fries to sweet potato fries. The sweet potato fries were a premium upgrade, but well worth it. The chicken came with an extremely spicy honey dijon sauce - so go easy if you're not good with spice, but it really made the fried chicken because it's tasteless otherwise. 

I'm not sure if it was because we were seated at the end of the room but it was hard to flag down our waitress when we needed her. Granted, this only happened twice - once when we were ready to order after needing more time and at the end to get our bill."}
{"text":"Came here a couple times and its consistent. 

The food is okay, wine list is great, ambience is casual and laid back. The most recent time I was here it was really empty, which really ruined the mood for me since I like more upbeat, fun places. 

I had the steak and it was pretty good, portions were fine for me but I know a couple of guys in our party wanted to get more food afterwards. Another time I was there I had a chicken salad that was really average but we did a wine tasting that day so that made up for it in my opinion. 

For dessert I had the flourless chocolate cake. It was not good. It was a really strange thick chocolate pudding like dessert that was too sweet. I don't know what I was expecting, I just wanted chocolate and this was not it. 

Price was too much for an average meal. I think it came to around $70 a person. 

This place is okay but would not recommend coming here if you want GREAT food. It's fine, not bad, and has good wine. You be the judge."}
{"text":"Had bday dinner for this place! My eyes lightened up when they serve seasonal lobster menu. The meal was fail but I had good prior experience so I give them an extra star. 

Right off the bet once we were seated after 15 min wait , NO one even gave us a menu! We kept looking over the hostess, she was outside of restaurant  playing with a lady's Husky dog n chatting with her. No one attended to us. We had to stick out head to get waitress attention. 

I ordered a $41 (before tax) lobsters n fries . It came out very greasy n when I asked to swab slaw to vege, they provided boiled asparagus (absolutely NO seasoning-- wish they at least dust salt n pepper on it) 

Odd thing. The fried lovers clusters when u open up the lobster batter ,  the lobster bits inside was VERY small. I was mostly eating batter , n to my SURPRISE! On the menu it says --- 1 whole lobster !!! There were TWO pieces of Calamari rings in the batter mixed along with chopped lobster bits . I was finger ripping the fried batter to eat them like finger food, when I saw a pearly white ring , i was like :\" what is this!\" !!!!!!I was suspecious then when I ate it it was totally calamari. Then guess what I ripped the rest batter apart! I found another piece of Calamari!!!! ---- this makes me VERY suspecious that the lobster was too small they used small pieces other sea food to fill in n used fried batter to mask it.

Did the chef ate some of my lobster n put calamari to make it look like more ?  I would have thought they tossed calamari by accident but since there were so little lobster so much batter. It made me believe it was on purpose because there were more than one calamari rings. They were white in circle with purple calamari skin on the ring trim. vs lobster bits were all red! The lobster itself doesn't have any of the usual tender juicy taste at all. The batter is not well seasoned . I felt like Eating oily dough. 

Def NOT worth $41! $17 fish n chips r better than this dish ! I have had steaks at this place n steaks with lobster for $35 at this location before. Don't know HOw they price this $41 .  U can get DOUBLE lobster n delicious mash potato n vege at Red Lobster for that price. U can also get whole double lobsters for $32-36 in Chinatown . 

On the side note. My friend took me out for lunch today  n told me never order fried lobster in restaurant because companies serve dead lobster when they stir fry or fry them. So I am all paranoid why they even make a fried lobster as part of menu now!  When steamed or baked lobsters r very juicy. It's just very suspecious!  

Anyways! Stay away from that dish! Get a baked lobster or just steaks at this place ! 

Shave off one star for waitress when she came over over n over again right aft my bf finished his beer to ask if he needed another one, but once he asked for it the last beer took like over 20 min. He ordered before k went to washroom, but aft I came back he still waited for long time . Then someone else brought us the beer when we went to cancel the beer. The waitress was speed walking I think she was over whelmed with the large group ppl , but 

They earned a star by serving free desert for my bday n they ended up didn't charge last beer when the beer was delivered over aft we canceled it aft long time when we were going to leave. 

Either way I still like this place , probably go to the REDS at the Yonge/Gerad instead tho. I have been to that location multiple times always better food n better service .  But I have to write a 2 star review. This place is under staffed , the manager r constantly doing bus boy duty delivering drinks to all the customers. It's my bday dinner but not impressed with the service n food."}
{"text":"Came here after work with a couple coworkers because Cactus Club Cafe was full. The service is fairly good with a coat check right at the door. The food is a bit pricey for what you get. I got the lobster grilled cheese and there was not nearly enough cheese to call it a grilled cheese. The bread was super crunchy and I got bonus lobster shell piece in there too - yummy.

My coworker got the shrimp ravioli and although I didn't try it, it looked friggin amazing. BUT be sure to clarify if you want the appetizer or dinner size.

Would I come here again? Only if someone else suggested it.

Tip: 18% gratuity added onto parties of 6 or more (I think it's 6...)"}
{"text":"The price is high, but its worth it. From the food to the wine, it complements each other. The Sommelier can help you pick a nice bottle and vinage that will complete your meal. 

The wine selection is changing and will improve. We did notice a couple of wines that were not on the menu, but were offered the bottles as well. That was a nice touch.

Take your time and enjoy. 2-4 hours should be enough to enjoy your entire experience"}
{"text":"Hit this place for my friends bday lunch. Posh atmosphere, great decor. The service, staff and recommendations were excellent. I got the seafood platter 4/5. The birthday girl ordered the penne pasta with drinks 4/5  and another friend ordered the chicken. 3.5/5. And dessert for the birthday girl was on the house. 
Definitely recommend for dinners, lunches, meetings etc."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and happened on this restaurant looking for steak frites.  The restaurant was fairly quiet as it is was a Tuesday, but still quite a few people. The atmosphere was nice but a little quirky. Service was great.  Had a reasonable and well priced Malbec.  Subbed grilled veggies for fries so I can't comment on that.  The steak was a perfect medium rare with a great crust and sautéed mushrooms. Amazing.  The vegetables were equally well cooked. Overall, one of the best steaks I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"Went there recently right after work for a work-related discussion. Nine of us. Just ordered drinks and appetizers. We had a big table upstairs. Pretty much had the second floor to ourselves so the service was efficient.

The assortment of appetizers were all somewhere between decent and good. A little pricey but good. But that's to be expected of an upscale place like this. Thankfully I didn't have to pay :-)

The waitress was very good. She noticed that we were totally absorbed in our discussion and deftly came in to take away plates and fill water glasses without interrupting us. She would try to catch people's eyes to see if anyone needed another drink but would never actually ask the question. 

The Good
- service was good (I believe the host of our get-together overtipped her)
- nice atmosphere; decor very upscale

The Bad
- food was decent (sliders were dry and bland) to good (calamari) but I expected it to be better

I'll go back. I just won't order the sliders next time."}
{"text":"Came here during the busy Friday lunch a few weeks ago (because Cactus Club Cafe next door was packed and ain't nobody got time for a 30 minute wait) and despite not having a reservation, our group of five was seated fairly quickly. Our hostess was very friendly and accommodating. While they were setting up our table, another hostess noticed us standing/waiting nearby and came by to make sure we were being taken care of. 

I ordered a wild mushroom soup and the small plate shrimp ravioli. Wild mushroom soup was really rich and delicious, but I was pretty disappointed by the shrimp ravioli. It was so greasy and I couldn't fully appreciate the flavors that were there since it was overpowered by the oil...which was unfortunate because the \"sundried tomato soffrito beurre blanc\" sounded and looked pretty tasty :( We finished off with their apple pie with bourbon ice cream. I love apple pie and thankfully, this definitely did not disappoint! 

Great atmosphere and service, but I won't be getting the shrimp ravioli next time!"}
{"text":"First of all this restaurant came its high recommendations - we checked it out on New Years Eve. 

The location sat us right away which was nice but that's where it all went down here. We ordered appetizers and 2 drinks. Waited about 20 minutes for them. 

This was not unique to just us, many others around you could feel the same frustration. 

Finally we got our meal. My wife ordered the Chicken Pasta with a egg over top and myself a 11oz peppercorn steak. The food and the service after this made us decide to never return. 

Her food was flavourless. And my mashed potatoes were ice cold and seemed as if there just sitting in a bowl ready to plate well before anyone had ordered them. They were also quite flavourless. My steak, was cooked well and a great portion l, so that was a plus. 

My wife was going talk to the waitress to ask her if she could order something else when she just picked up our plates, no discussion and left, only to return to see if we wanted desert. We finally talked about how flavourless my wife's meal was and the waitress shared that she had heard that from several staff members and they actually believe it or not just revamp that dish. Only plus was she covered the meal at the end. 

We ordered 2 more drinks - 20 minutes. Nothing. 

Then our waitress comes back with the bill. We asked her about the beer and she admitted she had forgot and got us our beer. 

For a New Years meal I expect it to be busy, but I also expect when I wait the service and food needs to great and the service (when we get it) to match. 

The girl who served us was nice but clearly run off her feet and the people running the place didn't do a good job on picking up when customers are clearly waiting for stuff they ordered a long time prior. 

Will not go back and if you do go. Lower your expectations. It's easier that way."}
{"text":"at a private event there last night and the munchies were delish - the mini grilled cheese, the filo-type flatbread, the sliders, the hummus dip, the truffle fries, etc, staff were really nice too, great job"}
{"text":"Situated in the heart of downtown Toronto, Reds is catered to the business crowd, social elite, or a nice evening out. 

Excellent servers (Kayla from Tottenham was ours) who were knowledgable of the menu and spoke highly of the quality and uniqueness of the food. 

Bar was stacked with great wines and unique beers. How often can you have a beer made in Hawaii??  Great choice by the way. 

We sat at the bar which was comforting and inviting with its dark rich colours.  Bangkok nachos, butternut squash soup, shrimp ravioli, and roasted turkey club were our chosen entrees. Every bite delicious and unique which sets it apart from just any eating establishment. Quality and uniqueness were spot on as described by Kayla. 

Reasonably priced, quality in every bite, and service to be recognized.  Evening made better by the homemade apple pie and vanilla ice cream made with vanilla beans from Africa. Dessert surprising served complimentary to us."}
{"text":"It's dark and loud in here. I think that's what it was going for, so good on them. It did make it really hard to read the menu because it was so dark, though, unfortunately. I actually pulled out my phone and turned on the flashlight so I could read the menu. Ordered some drinks, ate a decent yet forgettable meal, and left. The waitress was really cute and very friendly so that's nice. I was with some great company and that really made my memory of this place positive. I'd come again."}
