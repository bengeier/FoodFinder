{"text":"Honestly, I would have been a little more generous with the rating, but Omma is SO OVERPRICED! Every dish is about 1/4 more than it should be. On top of that, pickles are not included, which is usually a given in Korean restaurants. It's the kind of restaurant where you're paying more for the atmosphere and neighbourhood cachet than the food. Sadface.

Ok, the food. I got a bibimbap (chicken), which was decent, but not mind-meltingly amazing, which I kind of expected from other reviews. The kochujang (chile sauce) that comes with it was nice, but not very spicy. The meat was decently flavoured, but the whole thing was surprisingly oily and otherwise kind of bland. For home style Korean food, I would have walked away happy if it was costing me $13 dollars, rather than $17. All-in-all, I don't think I'll be going back unless I'm with someone that desperately wants to go."}
{"text":"The food at Omma was hands-down great.  However, the service was quite slow, which is nice if you are there for a super relaxed evening, not so great if you are trying to enjoy your meal with two young kids, as we were.  They did have a high chair, but it was pretty rickety.  But we particularly loved the vegetarian galette appetizer, the tea, and the kim chi.  The bimbibap was so-so, based on my limited Korean experience (i.e. the one downtown and 5000 ans in NDG).  Worth trying - when you have a babysitter!  Or else order for pick-up :)."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if Ms Kim's approach to her cooking was appropriated to the neighbourhood, or it genuinely reflects her cooking style. I would never entertain the notion of \"authenticity\", because that's a word I stay away from. The idea that the tastes and flavours I was used to didn't really show up that night at Mom's table of home cooked meals was interesting. From the sizzle-less and ready-fried egg on top of the dolsot bibimbap to the pseudo-spicy chicken, I got the impression that the food was \"self-conscious\"; it was apprehensive in showing its true colours in fear of not being accepted in this neighbourhood as being the first of its kind and for being so different. Not to say that Omma or the dishes undermine the intelligence or culinary prowess by presenting itself as something that the diner wants it to be by toning down the flavours and providing a more limited menu. Is Ms. Kim refining her own personal approach to Korean food by generalizing her dishes to introduce the cuisine to a people who might not have ever tried it before and making it more appealing to the locals of the Mile-End?"}
{"text":"I've been back to Omma 2-3 times and I really like it there now, I think you have to choose specific items on the menu to have a good experience. I would go with their chicken wings as an appetizer, and the bibimbap or the bulgogi as a main."}
{"text":"I found Omma on Yelp and decided to take my mom and a couple of friends there for dinner. We are not familiar with Korean food, but were keen to try it. Omma did not disappoint us at all! 
The ambience is nice and relaxed, we would have prefered to get a table outside, but their terrace was full. The servers were all very helpful and friendly. 
The food was delicious - we ordered the Dol Sot Bibimbap in beef, which is their speciality - it was scrumptious! The kyoga Saewoo Bokum shrimps were also tasty as was the Chap Chae, to which we added chicken. The 3 dishes were enough for 4 of us, but the food was so good, perhaps we should have ordered another just to taste! 
I would highly recommend it for a good Korean food experience."}
{"text":"Good food, marginal wine (small amount in glass;red wine was chilled), very nice service. Expensive for what you get; not good value for your money."}
{"text":"The Korean food here tastes different from Korean food elsewhere.  It could be the fact that it's \"homemade\", but I preferred the flavours I've been used to.  We had the seafood pancake, which was good, but I enjoy mine with more chew and texture.  We also had the deep fried squid, which was good but nothing to call home about.  Finally we had to Kimchi Jigae where the soup tasted like tomato soup, the pork was very dry and the rice cakes were few and soggy.  

The prices at Omma felt 20-30% higher than the average Korean restaurant, which meant the value-for-money was even lower.  I don't want to pass judgement on the food, but for the record, it wasn't quite right for me."}
{"text":"Fabulous meal and great atmosphere. Started with the beef dumplings, then the Bulgogi as my main dish. The dumplings were good but the Bulgogi was GREAT! We shared a slice of the matcha cheesecake with raspberry coulis between four... Big mistake... it was too good to share... Next time I'm getting my own (and I'm usually not a cheesecake fan)! The people working at the restaurant were very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Très belle soirée! Le bibimbap est vraiment bon et le service très courtois. Une belle petite découverte."}
{"text":"went here a few weeks ago when a friend of mine mentioned it,

I'm still looking for that one korean resto that has it all in mtl, sadly, the search continues...

The place is cozy and low key, very mom and pop. The staff wears bright colorful aprons which is cute.

We ordered cold glass noodles, pan cake and bibimbap which is rice with veggies and meat with a raw egg, mixed in a hot stone bowl which if hot enough should slightly char the bottom layer of your rice and give it a nice crispy texture. On this note Omma passed :)

My one caveat about this place was that the side dishes are a la carte, kim chi is 2.50$, whereas everywhere else it just comes free.

The glass noodles was good but portion wise it was small. The pancake was ok not as crispy as lee bong nim. The bibimbap was good except it was a bit small portion wise.

All in all, small plates and pricy... :(

Omma, means mommy in Korean, frankly if my mommy fed me like that i'd go home hungry :P

bit disapointing really."}
{"text":"I lived in Korea for a while and really love Korean food. Omma kind of takes a modern twist on the traditional meals, but in all the best ways. 

I highly recommend the bibimbap, as well as the sam bap bulgogi. 

The bibimpab is a rice and vegatable mix in a steaming hot bowl. You mix it up as the bowl cooks everything. 

The sam bap bulgogi is similar to korean BBQ. You get little pieces of BBQ beef that you dip in sauce and wrap into mini lettuce sandwiches.  It's excellent! 

I also recommend you grab a bottle of soju to compliment the food. 

My only critique is that it's slightly expensive in general. A few dollars more per item than should be."}
{"text":"Prepare to put some DOLLAZZ for those amazing Korean homemade dishes. Worth the price for the quality of food they're serving."}
{"text":"Omma God, I love it here. 

I crave crave crave their bibimbap, a big portion of rice and veggies and beef and egg served in a hot stone bowl which crispifies the rice to the most perfect of textures.  In my universe, there is nothing better than hot crunchy rice. 

My boyfriend lived in Korea for a year so he enjoys trying the various Korean restaurants around town for a dose of nostalgia. He misses the food there and I'm not sure anywhere in montreal has nailed it for him, but he did enjoy this place as well.  We got a bottle of Soju to share, which if memory serves correctly was a $15 drop. In Korea they are $1.  

Way over-priced, so I can only afford to go here every few months, but good quality food served by a truly lovely staff."}
{"text":"My favoutite korean restaurant in Montreal, plus the most charming area in Montreal.
Just enjoy the terrace during summer and try the spicy fresh salmon if you're fish addict."}
{"text":"The portions are WAY too small and really pricey. Our grilled chicken under-seasoned and the service was really slow. Don't understand why it's for stars. Maybe because of the neighbourhood but not worth them for sure. Ganadara in guy concordia is better and cheaper."}
{"text":"I was initially intrigued by this place after walking by it while going home a few days ago, so today, craving some Korean food, I suggested we check this place out. 

The inside was cute; paper lanterns, quiet jazz music, and orange ambient lighting made for a soft and relaxing atmosphere. I'd say that the restaurant can seat maybe 20 people max. It looked like there were two or three people behind the counter in the kitchen. The waiter was kind, and the service was pretty fast, but there was only one other group in the restaurant when we came. There's a bar that looks like it serves some sort of alcohol, probably beer, but we didn't sit there.

After frequenting (or at least trying) most of the popular places around the downtown area, I wasn't sure what taste I was expecting from this place - maybe something authentic, traditional? However, this wasn't the case. Though the taste was new for sure, the side dishes weren't traditional; in fact, there was only one dish of cabbage - no potatoes, which I basically live for. Still, it wasn't bad, even though it wasn't kimchi, since I'm a fan of sweet things. The sauce was reminiscent of sweet and sour sauce. As for the main dishes we ordered, the bulgogi wasn't the best I've had - it was too cooked and a bit burnt at the bottom. The bibimbap was better than average, but it felt like it didn't have much beef. 

In general, though I left Omma feeling comfortably full, I don't feel like the portions or quality of the dishes were worth the price. Though I put $$, it's more on the pricier side of $$, closer to $$$. Not as an insult, but I probably won't be back - there are many other choices in this area that I'd prefer."}
{"text":"OMMA représente l'une de mes découvertes préférées du Mile-End! Un bon restaurant coréen et avec une bonne ambiance. C'est mon amie qui m'a fait découvrir cet endroit et nous étions installées sur la terrasse. Celle-ci est pratique, puisque l'intérieur du restaurant n'est pas très grand. Le bibimpap du OMMA est l'un de mes favoris jusqu'à présent. Le prix est légèrement un peu plus élevé que ceux offerts dans le Chinatown, mais on sait que cela vaut la peine."}
{"text":"I really, really like this place. The staff is friendly and helpful. The food is delicious, albeit not exactly like the Korean I'm used to from my time in LA: More refined, smaller portions and bigger bill. Not necessarily better, tho. Cold beer on tap. Outdoor seating.     

Note: Portions are a bit skimpy. Don't go here hungry like the wolf and think you can just share an appetizer and a main with your sweetie. 

Rating Scale:
1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  
2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?
3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.
4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.
5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"Bibimbap is what I ordered which is a popular south Korean dish. I absolutely loved it! Service was professional and the food was very delish and authentic. The atmosphere was very small, cozy and romantic for both my boyfriend and myself. It is yet another resto located on Bernard street which is a very classy location. We loved it. I'll definitely be coming back and recommending this to others."}
{"text":"A little disappointing to be honest. I've been spoiled with Korean restaurants and this was a letdown. Service was ok except for the rude Quebec dude. Food was bland and didn't come with the wide variety of pickles you're used to when eating competently executed Korean. Bibimbap was fine, jap chae a bland downer of overlooked vermicelli and veggies. Maybe when it opened it was better; no sign of Omma in the kitchen tonight"}
{"text":"Une belle découverte! Nous sommes arrêtés à ce petit restaurant par hasard et nous avons été très surpris ! Les dumpling etait incroyables et les ailes de poulet sont divines ! C'est un bon spot pour essayer du coréen pour la première fois !"}
{"text":"Délicieux plats coréens, typiques
Il y a du choix, il y en a pour tous les goûts, ainsi que des options végé
Très bon service
Prix ok
Il vaut mieux réserver avant d'y aller
Seule petite déception: mon verre de Makoli était particulièrement peu rempli :("}
{"text":"JUST OK. Sometimes its hard to explain exactly why something works for you and why other things don't. The atmosphere was pleasant and decorated as expected. The staff was friendly and service attentive. The food came quickly but we never felt rushed. As I'm writing this I'm struggling to use descriptive words ... summing up the overall experience, rather non-descript. If you're in the Mile End area and looking for a change from Quebecois cuisine then this will work well but I wouldn't recommend making a tremendous effort."}
{"text":"Excellent Korean food, the riz aux sésames with spicy salmon tartare is to die for, had it twice and will remember the delicious taste for ever. A little overpriced but overall very good."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Korean restaurants like Chez Bong, 5000 ans etc. But Omma I'd say tops them all in terms of quality of dishes and service. I  came here when they just opened only a month or so and ordered the tofu appetizer which really tasted like something my Korean mom (if i had one) would make. My main dish was kimchi jigae and it was rich and flavorful. It had a strong taste but it was a good kind of strong. Service was very friendly and professional. Decor and menu style was cute. Prices are decent for sure. My boyfriend had a fish dish and it was soft and incredibly tender. I would definitely try other dishes and come back.  Their dessert menu is in the works fyi."}
{"text":"The food and service here were amazing! We loved the kale and the bibimbap! We showed up as a group of 5 without a reservation on a Thursday and had no problem getting a table."}
{"text":"OMMA provides a delicious and interesting dinning experience with kind and attentive service. 

We've stopped at Omma twice and will make a point of visiting on our next trips to Montreal again. 

Our favorite menu item is the spicy beef soup with mushrooms. The soup is a beautiful dish with deep subtle flavours that I crave even weeks later.

Other menu items we've tried::

Seaweed Salad:: 
This salad leaves a little to be desired, served with a soft variety of seaweed that was almost mushy and daikon, lettuce and carrot for texture. the flavour of the seaweed didn't really come through and so the $7 price tag for the rather small serving didn't feel justified. 

Salmon Sashimi Salad::
This is a mustardy take on a salmon sashimi salad. It was delicious though may have been helped by having a little less dressing to allow the flavor of the fish to come through more. Overall a tasty dish I wouldn't hesitate to order again. 

The beef lettuce wraps::
Served on a hot skillet with lettuce, kimchi and rice. The beef was deliciously flavoured and made for tasty wraps that we devoured and would definitely order again.

The spicy beef and mushroom soup::
This is a soup to write post cards about. Delicious, hearty, deep and flavorful do not leave this restaurant without indulging in this soup. It is a large bowl that would make a satisfying meal on its own or makes a great entree  to share after a few starters. 

OMMA is best when you can enjoy it's stunning patio as the interior is a little sparse and could use a little love and imagination."}
{"text":"Intimate setting, good, informed,attentive wait staff, the food very good. I had the shitake broth with beef dumplings, very good and satisfying,followed by the spicy roasted salmon served on a bed of baby spinach with rice on the side. This was also very good without being overly spiced.  This is also the ONLY place in the city that has Korean sake,  imported directly from Korea.The prices are very reasonable especially  considering the locale."}
{"text":"Une belle rencontre ! Cela mérite un arrêt. Prenez les repas brunch, goutez la différence, une cuisine coréenne de qualité, vous pouvez y aller en confiance. Les épices sont présents, à savoir. Le bento était parfait. On est dépaysé, accompagné par une équipe qui explique très bien les plats et avec gentillesse. Pas de pression sur le client, c'est apprécié sur Bernard! Le décor est délicat, poétique, mais on y est bien à l'aise, simplement."}
{"text":"My son had been raving about the bibimbap for two years before we finally had a chance to go together so that he could introduce me to it. It's a dish that definitely lives up to its reputation for being tasty, filling and seriously fun. I like adventurous food, and this falls into that category! The sizzling hot bowl full of rice, your choice of meat (or no meat) and pickled veggies arrives with a raw egg on top, which you stir in and watch it cook on the spot. The nice thing about the sizzling bowl is that your food stays warm the entire meal through. Keep stirring though, or you'll have some seriously crispy rice on the bottom of the bowl. It's kind of like a combo of a stir fry, pickles and tadik - hot, cooked pickles are actually really delicious and I've always been a tadik fan. 
When we arrived, early in the dinner hour on a week night, the entire place was empty indoors and there were still places to sit on the patio, which is where we chose to be seated. I would have given five stars, but our waiter completely forgot to bring us the spicy sauce, which is an essential element of your bibimbap. In fact, he spaced out and forgot about it pretty much as soon as we asked for it - probably because he was a bit twitterpated by the pretty, young girls at the table next to us. Ah, youth. 
My young date and I were completely satisfied with our meal, and there were plenty of other super yummy-sounding and -looking things on the menu. Those pretty girls had some fried wontons which I think I would order next time. 
It was a special date with my darling son, and so Omma will forever be lit by a positive shimmer for me!"}
{"text":"Best call ahead and reserve a table because that is what everyone else does here when the weather is poor and you can't sit outside.  This restaurant is small and poorly run.  I was bluntly told that they couldn't accommodate me when there were 7 empty tables...and they remained empty the entire time I was there.  I had to ask if they would let me order take out.  I then stood there for roughly 15-20 minutes and waited.  Just before I left at 7:30 a table of 3 who had a reservation for 7pm showed up.  Surprised the owner of this restaurant would want to turn away business on the hopes that people will show up for their reservations because those empty tables are lost revenue that you can never get back.  Mind you if people are turned away repeatedly they'll just take their business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Zufallsfund im Mile End Viertel! Eigentlich wusste ich gar nicht, welche Küche in diesem Lokal serviert wurde, ich tippte mal auf französisch. Der romantische Außenbereich mit den vielen kleinen Tischchen lockte mich an, zum Abendessen einzukehren. 

Glücklicherweise war dann auf der Terrasse auch noch ein Platz frei. Als ich die Katte erhielt war ich eher erstaunt, dass es sich um ein koreanisches Lokal handelte. Auch die Inneneinrichtung wirkte sehr schlicht und doch heimelig und lies nicht vermuten dass es sich um ein asiatisches Lokal handelte.

Ich war aber vollkommen positiv überrascht, da ich eh gerne koreanisch esse!
Die Karte war übersichtlich, was meiner Meinung nach wieder für das Lokal sprach. 

Ich entschied mich für ein Tofu Reisgericht, welches in einem Gusseisernen Pot serviert würde und dann quasi vor meinen Augen selbst fertig briet, da dieser extrem heiß war. Oben auf war ein rohes Ei welches ich einrühren sollte. Auf dem Boden bildete sich eine leckere Kruste und ich schaffte fast die ganze riesen Portion! Also die vorherigen Kommentare, wo angemerkt würde die Portionen wären klein kann ich nicht bestätigen. Vielleicht bei den Vorspeisen? Das kann ich aber nicht beurteilen da ich nur das Hauptgericht bestellte. 

Außerdem trank ich einen leckeren Zitronengras-Ingwer Tee, den ich mir aus einer extra Teekarte ausgesucht hatte.

Zum Essen trank ich einen Weißwein bei dem ich leider die falsche Auswahl traf und eine viel zu Süßen bekam. 
Ich bestellte mir dann einen neuen mit dem Vermerk, dass mir der andere zu süß war. Erstaunlicherweise ging dann der Süße Wein aufs Haus.

Die Preise fand ich auch in Ordnung. Mein Hauptgericht kostete umgerechnet 10. Auch hier kann ich die vorherigen Beiträge, dass die Preise gehoben sind nicht verstehen.

Fazit: Essen sehr gut, Service aufmerksam und freundlich, Preise moderat und Ambiente wunderschön! Ich komme wieder!"}
{"text":"OMG this is not a Korean restaurant.
Everything we had did not taste korean at all.
It was more like a chinese / korean / canadian meal.

Service was sooooo bad. They didnt serve Kimchi after  we ask 2 times.. abd when we went to pay i told the waitress and she answer .... do you want to bring it home??? What a stupid answer. Also waiter dont really want to speak english...

We wait more than 40 minutes for main dishes. 

We spend more than 140$ for this and any other korean restaurant in montreal is more authentic and delicious than this one. 

I do not recommand this restaurant to any people who want to experience korean food.

 I was really disapoint because the place looks great from outside."}
{"text":"I was thrilled to see Omma replace the restaurant formerly in this space on Bernard, especially since I've been longing to have some Korean food in Mile End (this neighbourhood covers all sorts of different cuisines, but Korean wasn't really one of them until now). 

So far everything I've tried there has been delicious. Bibimbap served in a smoking hot stone bowl was fantastic, with just the right amount of crunch around the edges and a fresh, bright, chill ginger sauce that added a little zip without being excruciatingly hot. The salmon sashimi bowl my dinner companion tried was so good he practically licked the bowl. 

Try the Korean tea - the combination of lemon and honey makes it a nice delicate way to end a meal, or to kick off a brunch (we've had it both ways).

Staff are lovely and friendly, and the new decor is bright but soothing. 

I'll definitely be going back - there are so many more things on the menu that I'd like to try. A definite must visit if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Cute signage, cozy ambience, and the young man who served me (tousled blond hair, worked behind the bar and saw me waiting to order unlike the young woman who sat me at my table) was very pleasant. Food alright, nothing too complicated but my only complaint (based on what I ordered; the steamed tofu appetizer followed by the salmon sashimi with rice and salad main) is that they need to cool it on the sauce. Both dishes were doused in sauces that were so heavy on the tastebuds and could have been far less spicy--not because I can't handle my spicy foods, but because the heaviness of it all just took away from the actual dishes themselves. I could have been eating horse meat instead of salmon and I wouldn't have known the difference...well, maybe not horse meat but you catch my drift. Otherwise it is a nice little spot in a great neighbourhood."}
{"text":"J'ai adoré mon expérience au Omma! L'ambiance intimiste, le décor très cutie et les plats préparés avec amour m'ont fait tombé avec l'endroit. Je reviendrai assurément!"}
{"text":"A little on the pricier side, but the vibe and food really do make up for it!

Their bibimbap and salmon are amazing!"}
{"text":"This is a cozy, pretty restaurant with fresh, flavourful food, a sweet little cocktail list (which you might have to ask for) and not one but two leafy terrasses off rue Bernard. This is a sweet place for a date: not overly expensive, romantic lighting, and you'll eat at a mellow pace set by the friendly good looking staff. Everything I've tried here has been good. It might not be the most perfecto combo of authentic/inexpensive (I love Chingu down the street) but the chicken wings are crazy good, the bibimbap will always make me glow from the inside, and when i brought my whole family here everyone was happy and no one complained, about anything! A triumph."}
{"text":"Omma god the new location is better than the original one. Make sure to come early enough, it's small and fills up fast. We had the sweet potato noodles (definitely recommend), the spicy beef soup, and the red curry. What really makes this place is the intimate environment and cute decor. Great place for a date!"}
{"text":"Décor zen. Personnel bilingue, charmant, souriant et impeccable. Excellent bibimbap. Le thé coréen est une délicieuse découverte. Attention aux papilles sensibles, la nourriture coréenne est épicée!"}
{"text":"Petit restaurant que nous avons découvert malgré nous! Nous voulions nous rendre dans un autre, qui était fermé! Nous n'avons pas du tout été déçu! L'endroit est petit et chaleureux, le décor est super pour les belles photos et la bouffe était succulente! En plus de tout ça, les prix sont super abordables! 

C'est vraiment une belle découverte et c'est parfait si vous avez un spectacle au théâtre Rialto en soirée :)!"}
{"text":"One of the best gems in the city. Omma is absolutely delicious and well priced for the area.
 Personal favourites include the bibimbap which comes in the glorious stone bowl as well as the vegetarian mandoo (sautéed dumplings). The complimentary cabbage is a nice amuse bouche but if you're wanting more the Omma salad is a good appetizer. 
The bibimbap is just perfect- crispy rice, well seasoned vegetables, the egg on top and then the most amazing chilli sauce to pour on. You can order it with brown rice if you're trying to be healthier! Other notable dishes include the tuna steak and the sesame rice with salmon. 
Good wine selection and again very well priced. The ambiance is casual and relaxing and the waitstaff are all very accommodating."}
{"text":"OMMA signifie \"maman\" en coréen, et c'est bien cet esprit qui règne à table.


Au cur du Mile End, la cuisine du OMMA est sous la direction d'une authentique maman coréenne, Mi Kyum Kim. Dans son petit resto de quartier sans prétention, elle concocte une vraie cuisine ménagère qui inclut de réconfortantes soupes fumantes et le dak nalge tigim, ou six ailes de poulet bonnes à s'en lécher les doigts. Le sam bap bulgogi est un plat intéressant et ludique puisqu'on doit placer soi-même des lanières de buf grillées sur une feuille de laitue ou de sésame en ajoutant du kimchi, une pâte de piment et du riz collant. À manger avec les mains. Le poisson OMMA, des filets de poisson blanc servis avec une mayonnaise au wasabi, est également digne de mention. À boire en fin de repas le yujacha, une boisson chaude aux agrumes et au miel. 

Une décoration minimaliste mais efficace et une ambiance multiculturelle ou un service à la québécoise côtoie une cuisine traditionnelle coréenne. Menu changeant au cours des saisons. Durant l'été profiter de la terrasse, elle n'est pas très grande ni très attrayante mais toute fois agréable durant les beaux jours.

Au passage j'en profite pour vous faire part d'une découverte. Un site pour les amoureux de la cuisine coréenne: http://www.kimshii.com/p/liste-des-recettes-coreennes.html

BONNE BOUFFE!

 Archevêque B"}
{"text":"The food at Ommas was actually pretty good - we had gyozas and pickled veggies as starters and chicken bulgogi (I think that was the name) as a main dish. The chicken came with a salad leaf, which was recommended to be filled with the kimchi and the chicken. In my opinion, the leaf was redundant. 
On that evening, the waiting staff unfortunately did not seem very motivated. 
Last but not least, our dinner at Omma was surprisingly pricey."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. You have to try it! Such a wonderful atmosphere and equally perfect food. We wandered onto this place during our trip to Montreal. So happy we stopped in. We started off with the wing appetizer - very unique and tasty - the sauce was covered with a bit of crispy panko. This was followed by beef broth soup with wontons. We ordered some kimchee on the side and some delicious bibimbap. My companion ordered the salmon, also wonderful. I also had this amazing local cider - perfect and not too sweet - called FÛT sec SOMA. Best restaurant went to in Montreal."}
{"text":"I have eaten TONS of Korean food, including eating it in South Korea and this was easily as good if not better.. super clean and tasty.served super fresh and steaming. The B with tofu and the pancake with seafood."}
{"text":"I've heard lots of good things about this restaurant, and so finally came here tonight for dinner and drink.
My first impression whike making reso on the phone with the Ontario branch was great, just as when I called later at the Bernard one to switch reso, everyone was very accomodating and nice.
The staff at the Bernard branch was very nice, nothing to complain about. It was full house so very little interaction to be able to comment more.
The menu looked incredible, we wanted to eat everything but because we were only 2, there's only so much we could do, so we settled for 2 cocktails, Yuzu and Ginger. For food we took the filet mignon tartare on Asian pear, Soondooboo jigae (spicy tofu stew), chicken Dol Sot Bibimbap (w/ crispy rice) and the matcha cheesecake. Everythin was yummy, although the Matcha cheesecake could use some more matcha :)
It's a great little spot to visit, I would recommend it. I cannot say how authentic the food is as I don't have anything else to compare to but I can say that it tasted good so go and see for yourself! ^^"}
{"text":"Cute Coreean. Don't expect fancy ambiance or set-up, but this is a great spot for some good, Coreean comfort food. Try the bibimbap!!"}
{"text":"Omma has a nice cozy feel with a good wait staff but bottom line we all go to restaurants to eat. I started w/ fried calamari and chicken wings, nothing wow. Main dishes was galbi Jim and grilled chicken (looked nothing like the picture).  The stew was under seasoned and too sweet and the beef was chewy. Chicken was blah, with no hints of flavors from Korea.  An embarrassing note * they undercooked their white rice. Strange, how could Asians do such a thing? I was dining with 2 other couples we all had the same conclusion... Thanks to the front for the house for the service, but the back needs to work harder to convince people it's a Korean restaurant."}
{"text":"Pour dire toute la vérité, j'avais hâte de quitter, et mon amie aussi. Cependant, je trouvais ça injuste de retirer une étoile à mon avis à cause de notre irritation face aux autres clients. Notez toutefois que, si comme moi, vous aimez manger relativement en paix, ne pas vous faire dévisager parce que vous mangez votre bulgogi avec les mains - comme il se doit - et recevoir les factures promptement, ça peut miner votre sortie.

Maintenant que l'agacement est sorti de mon système, on va parler de bouffe. C'est si bon!

Entrées partagées:

Mandoo/Raviolis vapeur au buf et à l'oignon .
3.5/5
La garniture est bonne, la pâte du dumpling est ordinaire et se déchire (trop?) facilement. 

Dubu twigim/Tofu croustillant, sauce soya épicée, oignons verts et sésame.
 4.5/5
Le tofu n'est pas croustillant. C'est même un tofu soyeux qui \"s'égraine\" si l'on essaie de le saisir trop fort avec les baguettes. Je ne me suis pas acharnée et j'ai décidé de le consommer avec une cuillère, bloc par bloc, ce qui avait l'avantage de ramasser un maximum de saveur de sauce, de sésame et de morceaux d'oignons verts. C'était vraiment délicieux, une belle présentation et prometteur pour la suite du repas!

Mon repas:

Grillade bulgogi de buf, accompagné de riz collant, sauce épicée, kimchi de choux, feuilles de laitue.
5/5
Toutes les pièces de viande étaient parfaites en texture et en goût. La quantité de kimchi qui les accompagnaient était suffisante pour faire des bons assemblages pour que toutes les bouchées soient remplies de miam. Ouais, c'est vrai que j'aurais quand même aimé qu'il soit proposé sans frais à la table, comme c'est le standard ailleurs. Mais bon, on nous a servi une petite salade fraîche avec notre eau dès qu'on s'est mises à table, alors ça n'était pas trop radin.

PS 1: Oui, le prix était plus élevé que dans d'autres restaurants coréens, mais les portions, le goût et le service du gars avec les cheveux châtains fluffy le valait amplement.

PS 2: Les illustrations sur le menu sont cute à mourir."}
{"text":"As much as I love Korean food, this place unfortunately did not impress me as much.
Their atmosphere is nice and service is attentive, but that's about it. They didn't have complimentary banchan like most Korean restaurant, in fact, they charge you for a small plate of kimchi which I find it bit odd. Their selection is not as big and some of the dishes are not really Korean. Although the food is good, I personally find it overpriced. There are definitely other restaurants where you can get better food for less."}
{"text":"Good ambience, but the service took more then an hour. I get that the food is good, but having had plenty of amazing Korean food I don't believe it should be priced at what it is - nor should it take that long; however if you are on a second date & really want to get to know someone. . . then OMMA is your place!  Open a bottle of wine and wait for two hours before your food arrives (we timed it!), and get to know your date very well! Having been in a four year relationship this is not our goal when we go out to eat- so no seconds please ;)"}
{"text":"Omma was a really cute, trendy type place.
The motif is really hipster/sustainable.
The food arrived promptly and was quite good. My experience with Korean food is extremely limited, but I do know what I liked and I liked Omma.
The wait staff was super friendly and, though my water glass was small, it was never empty. When the kitchen and wait staff are so attentive to your dining experience, absolutely nothing else is needed."}
{"text":"Un très joli restaurant sur bernard, avec une décoration soignée et subtile. Mais surtout une large carte qui m'a laissée démunie :) pas très habituée à la cuisine coréenne, j'ai choisi mon plat phare - le bibimbap. Goutu à souhait même si un peu gras.
J'y retournerai pour être plus audacieuse sur le choix !"}
{"text":"Lovely place, my Kimchi Jigae was to die for, sour and warm it was perfectly seasoned. We also had the bibimbap which was really tasty aswell. The only thing is that there is no asians here so meaning it's too pricy, the place is ajusted to occidental taste. I will be back just because there's is not much choice for korean food in my area."}
{"text":"A restaurant i keep coming back to over the years.partly because it is on the corner of my street but mostly because it is the loveliest korean restaurant in montreal.the place is small and cozy with flower patterned curtains and white brick walls,in the summertime there is a charming terrasse.i have tried almost everything on the menu.i love the dumplings,their tofu,the spicy salmon tartare and the hot crispy bimbimbap.it is a family owned restaurant,the food is always consistent,the service is attentive and friendly,the spice is just right,the wine list is short but offers good choices,it is realy a great and lovely restaurant in the mile end.my only negative aspect is that i find it a little expensive for korean food (compared to other good korean places in mtl like myga and mon ami),but that wont stop me from coming back regularly and recommending this lovely place to everyone"}
{"text":"Loved my experience here! 

Came on a Saturday night around 8:30. There was no room on the terrace so we started our inside. The staff was great and gave us a table outside once one opened up! 

Good mix of a younger and older crowd here. 

Both my friend and I ordered the bibimbap. The little salad you get so start had a great zing! When the food took a bit longer to come out, due to a large party that had just ordered ahead of us, we were offered an extra salad! 

Loved the food, was well balanced. Be sure to ask how spicy certain items are!!

Bibimbap - $17-25 depending on if you take with meat, extra egg et

Other dishes on the menu for mains were around $22-$30. In my opinion prices could maybe be dropped a few dollars, a bit on the expensive end. However, with the price comes an experience, a great staff, and overall night out :)

Wine - $8-11 per glass, bottles $38-$56. Cool wine list as well, which categorized and listed wine as being dry, sweet, fruity, etc..."}
