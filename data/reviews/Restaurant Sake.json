{"text":"I love Sushi!! I live near the Boston area so I've tried basically everything here. Restaurant Sake is the BEST sushi restaurant I've ever been to! It's not even close....

Everything made is fresh! That's the most important thing, their rice is always in the perfect state. Chef's there really think outside of the box incorporating French influence into their maki. It's utterly delicious...I can't recommend one item because everything is incredible! 

Service is awesome...It's family owned so the effort will always be there. Just great, friendly people. Parking is aplenty and you won't have any problems there. 

If you're ever visiting Montreal I HIGHLY recommend you make the 25 minute drive to Saint-Eustache and try this great restaurant! You won't regret it."}

{"text":"This is the best sushi in town! Fish is ALWAYS super fresh, the sushi chef, Hoang, takes care to pick each fish himself. There is creativity in each sushi piece, you can find some fish that really few restaurant offer, the ambiance is great and it's bring your wine! You really have to give it a try. This is by far my best sushi restaurant in Saint-Eustache."}
