{"text":"I wish there was a 1/2 star option but you know there isn't so I have to give it one. Where to begin... Our meals took almost an hour to come out on an average Thursday night. 
When the food finally comes out the server brings out my meal and says who got the cheeseburger with mustard...but the burger has no cheese and no mustard!!
One of the worst meal experiences I've ever had. I do not recommend it if it's important for you to get your food in a timely fashion, hot or prepared as you've specified. Lower your expectations or dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"I like this place. If only there were Cheddars in West Chester, PA, that would make me happy!
Pros:
1. The waitress recommendation of tilapia with mango salsa was delicious! I ordered it with broccoli casserole and carrots.
2. The mango sweet tea was delicious!
3. I loved the setting of the place, including the aquarium!
Cons: None, there was nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"We were in luck today and got to try a preview of Cheddar's.  If you live in Chandler like we do, then you've probably also driven by this place 100 times, patiently waiting for its opening.  Shouldn't be too much longer... as in next week... first week in April.  Cheddar's is on the same plot of land as the former Redfish and Royal Buffett.  However, Cheddar's was smart and had the old building torn down.  They've built a new structure, exactly how they want.  It looks great inside and out; my kids loved the large fish tank.

Being in training mode, the service was A+.  We had multiple managers stop by asking how everything was and our server was great too.  We had no issues and everyone was friendly.  I so hope they stay this way when they finally open their doors.

We tried two appetizers: chips & homemade queso and the homemade onion rings.  Five stars for both.  My picky 3 year old actually enjoyed the queso.  My wife and daughter said the onion rings were the best they've ever tried.  Not greasy at all.  I had heard good things about both and they did not disappoint.  If you like onion rings, you must try these for sure.

I tried the baby back ribs and my wife tried the philly cheesesteak.  While I absolutely loved the ribs, my wife said she'd probably skip the philly next time.  She said it wasn't bad, just not one of the better sandwiches she's had.  My ribs were much meatier than similar orders from Chili's or the Outback.  If I ever crave baby back ribs again, I'm going to Cheddar's.  I also had a baked potato (average) and buttered off-the-cob corn (decent).  My boys tried the mac and cheese, which they said was good, but would have preferred without the breadcrumb topping.  Their sides were the apple and yogurt medley, which they thought was the dessert!  My daughter likes a lot of different foods (unlike her picky brothers), so she could have had anything on the kids menu and been fine with it.   I had her try the chicken tenders (which I had also heard good things about).  They are excellent!  I'm not going to lie, I tried a bite, or two, ok maybe three!  They are hand-breaded and clearly one of the best things on the menu.  I know I will be ordering the full size entree in one of my future visits.  Her side was french fries, which were seasoned and cooked perfectly.

As for prices, take your typical Chili's or Applebee's menu and subtract a dollar or two from everything.  Not a bad deal at all.  When you add in the quality of the food (items being made in-house, etc.), there is no comparison, Cheddar's is the clear-cut winner.  I can already picture this place on a Friday or Saturday evening... good luck trying to get in.  Overall, Cheddar's has great food at good prices.  This family of five will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This had been a favorite place, but consistency seems off now.  We went tonight (fam of 4 with 2 elem schoolers) and service was just slow.  Joshua was our server, and while capable I guess, there was no urgency.  Now I know it is not Ruth's Chris or anything, but I have had more interest in the business from Jason's Deli or Jimmy John's subs!  We had spinach dip, and it had clearly been sitting - it was lukewarm with a skin on top.  Our food arrived several minutes after expected in every case and was lukewarm every dish.  Parents had the buffalo chicken wrap, a usual favorite, and it was lukewarm.  Kids food also.  To top it off we ordered the monster cookie.  Now on the menu it says to allow several minutes for baking.  They allowed several minutes extra I guess, because it had clearly been sitting awhile before being brought out, the ice cream was half melted - so much soup of ice cream you could not see the cookie.  Nice.  

Now ok, it was Sunday, and they had some full tables.  So I expected a little wait.  But when the food is done you bring it out : it should still arrive hot.  We have small kids, and don't need to spend money out, so we pick and choose.  I'll be picking Bravo or Chili's again LOTS of times before picking Cheddars again."}
{"text":"The food is okay but the service is always below average. Every time my boyfriend and I come we wait a good amount of time to be seen and even more time to be asked for our order. Everyone is friendly but they need to work on their speed/readiness...and maybe a smile from our server wouldn't hurt."}
{"text":"First time going here, had the grilled chicken Alfredo it was delicious. Waitress was very kind. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We tried Cheddar's for the first time about a week ago. Everyone at our table was happy with both the service and the plates we received for our orders. We will be going back again."}
{"text":"Omg I could live on the croissants!!!! I'd be 500 pounds but man they are so good it might be worth it!!! Food was really good! I like the sides and the prices didn't bust the budget. Staff was super friendly and attentive! Didn't have to wait to get a table on a Friday night at 8pm. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place to go for dinner. Prices are very reasonable, service is great and menu selections was good too.  Had the salmon , and hubby ordered the tipila fish also.  It was good."}
{"text":"Wonderful place ...nice & clean ..great services ..best apple pie ever...(_ just not enough ice cream)..I was told it's the only thing they don't make in house .."}
{"text":"The decor is extremely nice here...felt fancy...Nice fish tank which kept both of my kids occupied...good pricing. ..ok food...nothing too special to brag about. ..The strawberry iced tea was ok.. The 8 oz steak was cooked perfectly. ...lacked seasoning. Mashed potatoes were ok....broccoli cheese casserole was my favorite and the only thing I finished.  My husband's steak which came with the combo was over cooked...even though we both ordered it medium. His shrimp was good. Talapia and shrimp was ok....nothing to rave about. The side of fries were $1.99 and very small...even for my kids...and the mac and cheese was a hit....The server was great...He was super friendly and good with asking how everything was going and with refills."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in charlotte, nc.....never a disappointment!!!!! :-)"}
{"text":"We heard about this place from family and decided to give it a try.  The food was great and prices were very reasonable.  The tilapia with mango salsa was excellent. We also ordered the sampler platter as an appetizer and the ribs and shrimp combo. The chicken strips were very tasty,  ribs were just okay-I've had better... I also had the PainKiller- which was delicious as well! The service was great!"}
{"text":"This review is only about the incredible service of Michael Dunn. 

(Cheddar's Chandler) 

It took two weeks to think of the perfect words to express the outstanding service that was bestowed upon my aunt and I, by our entertaining and professional waiter Michael Dunn. I have never had a dinning experience like this ever in my 30 years and I'm 30. (Not even my mother served me as well as him and she burped me...Ha.) All jokes aside, I have been to several 5 star restaurants that did not have his amazing passion for customer service. I have been to Cheddar's a couple times,  the food is always wonderful and service is always friendly....... But Michael Dunn is a God send. He needs to train other people in the art of serving. Not only was he extremely professional, he had a personality that was entertaining and welcoming. Michael is amazing. My aunt and I agree that we will only be served by him from now on. The other staff is wonderful, but once you have the Michael experience you are addicted. He is so attentive it is unmatched in comparison to other outside dining experiences I've encountered. He spoke so highly of the restaurant and is definitely management material. He will surely have successful and bright future with any endeavor he takes on! Michael Dunn is the answer to everything!!! We will be seeing him very soon for another ultimate dining experience!!! 

This is just a small summary to describe this Man's service,  but there are no words that can tell you the experience I had. You just have to experience his service yourself.

{"text":"i believe this place has gone downhill. don't get me wrong, i love cheddars. i first experienced cheddars where i went to school in johnson city, tennessee. the place in johnson city was great. the managers gave us student discounts, and the service was beyond phenomenal. it opened in johnson city in spring of 2001 and then opened in charlotte the following year. i told my grandmother about it and said that we needed to go while i was in charlotte for thanksgiving. we went two days before thanksgiving, as my classes were always cancelled for a break during thanksgiving week, and the food was phenomenal. the service was great, and she loved it. 
since moving to the charlotte area i have been there a handful of times; enough for them to know me. i went there once with a girl from work one friday afternoon. the restaurant was not so crowded, and the woman said it would be about twenty minutes for a table. mind you, the entire place was just about empty. i told her that there were tons of places; however, she said that these places were currently not available. we waited, and they sat us as soon as they could. the good news was that we did not have to wait twenty minutes. she and i ordered. i ordered the grilled chicken salad with no cheese and told them to add pico instead, and an order of chicken tortilla soup. i told her honey mustard dressing on the side as i am not a ranch fan. my friend ordered the buffalo chicken salad with ranch on the side. the server never brought out the soup and when i got the salad it was covered with ranch dressing. my friend's salad had blue cheese dressing. we sent it back, and the server just snatched the salads up without saying anything to us. she brought us back new salads about ten minutes later. also, my soup never came and when she came to bring us the bill it was on there. she started to argue with me about how i had already eaten the soup. i said it was never brought. she apologized in such a way that was full of apathy. 
i kept her name in my billfold so the next time i would know he name. she was scheduled to be the server weeks later when we brought other friends, but we said we wanted a different one. they brought us another one who was so sweet. everything was correct and brought out in a timely manner.
i call it a soup curse. ever since i have been there and ordered the soup, the wrong soup has been brought, or no soup was brought at all. this place that was once my favorite restaurant has turned from awesome to just okay."}
{"text":"So my husband and I are happy to find another open late option near our home. We had the cheese bites, which I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty and non-greasy they were. I had the citrus salmon and he had a chicken mushroom dinner. Overall for the price I don't have too much to complain about. The portion was perfect, my salmon was grilled perfect. No dryness whatsoever in his chicken either. Really the only negative was the baby purée which my husband said was supposed to be his mashed potatoes, and his rice was over done while mine was a bit underdone. All in all, I definitely think this place is a step up from Applebee's and would give it another try. Service was good and attentive which was appreciated since we arrived close to closing time."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Very good prices.  Get the Chicken Tenders made from scratch.  Lots of other good choices on the menu, too.  Staff are very nice...Rosie served us and she was great!  She even brought over her place card that told us a little about herself which I thought is a nice personal touch."}
{"text":"Cheddars is one of my favorite places to visit when I am in town. I love the broccoli cheddar casserole and the baked salmon. When we arrived, the hostess Sabria, was very polite, but not all that friendly. She didn't smile or seem happy to be at work. (We came in two hours before they closed, so that may have had something to do with it). 

Luckily, Briana came to our rescue and provided stellar customer service. Our food came out fast and she was a delight to work with. She made sure our drinks stayed full and really accommodated our needs. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service is amazing hands down. And the food is even better. It may be on the more expensive size compared to Applebee's but the portions are very well worth it. The chicken tenders are very large. The steak is wonderfully and tender. Their famous baked potato soup is where it's at. This is a must visit place."}
{"text":"This place was great! The service was wonderful. We had a server named Tyrell who was one of the best servers I have ever had! We told him it was our first time dining at cheddar's and he gave us a full speech about the menu including multiple great recommendations from each section. He was very personable, quick and kind. My buddy and I are going to go back there almost completely because of Tyrell!

We ended up ordering almost everything he recommended. I started with the Wisconsin cheese bites and my buddy had the queso dip. I had the chicken tenders & ribs combo with a side of string beans and mac n cheese as my entree. My buddy had the chicken tenders & shrimp combo with sides of fries and mac n cheese for his entree. All of those was delicious! I could spend time explaining what was amazing about every part of these dishes but then this post would be too long! 

We ended the meal with the big cookie dessert. This was good but not great. The cookie was too airy and slightly over baked but the ice cream was still good haha. 

Over all this place was awesome; my roommates and I are definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food and great prices! We have been to this location twice, both were good but the second time was better because we got a server who was very knowledgeable about the restaurant and the menu. The potato skins are delicious! As are the cheese bites, spinach dip, potato soup, and philly cheesestake! Their flavored ice teas are great and fresh (not all syrupy). We tried their legendary cookie for dessert which was not that good but that's because i don't like crispy cookies and it was very crispy/crunchy. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I normally am not one to write a review but I felt the need to counteract the bad press on this place.  Yes we had to wait about 20 min to be seated but it was well worth it! Our server, Rachel, was excellent.  We never had to ask for anything it's like she read out minds.  She was great to recommend things and all of us took her up on recommendations.  I had the monti Christo which was delicious and enough for two.  Our table also had Tuscan chicken sandwhich and chicken tender dinner.  All were happy with their choices.  The kids grilled chicken was nice and tender.  The food was excellent and the service was fantastic.  Thanks Rachel! You rock!"}
{"text":"For those who love a nice relaxing vibe and casual dining , cheddars is the place for you. Delicious food, amazing service and a full bar, you can't go wrong. I recommend the baby back ribs. Juicy , fall of the bone tender and slathered in BBQ sauce. My mouth is watering just reminiscing about my experience eating at cheddars."}
{"text":"Great obedience . The red beans and rice was perfect . The bar area was cozy and personal . This place replace red fish and was remodel perfectly ."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight for the first time , and it was pretty dang good!! Our waitress was awesome and did a great job on keeping on top of everything. We got the Wisconsin cheese bites for an appetizer, which were a bit salty but amazing! We also got the stacked onion rings, soooo good!! For entrees, I did the chicken Caesar salad pasta, which was quite interesting but it was good! My sister had the baked potato soup which she loved. My daughter had the baked spaghana , which was a baked spaghetti like lasagna, interested but really good!! Hubby had a ribeye, aside from it being a little tough to chew, he liked the flavor. The atmosphere was nice and clean. My daughter was fascinated with the fish tank which was right by our table. The reason I give it a 4 stars ( really 4.5) is because of the cheese bites being a little salty and the toughness of my hubby's ribeye. We will be back though!"}
{"text":"They say first impressions are always the best .. well this one didn't impress me. Granted it's a Friday but the mgr in this place is was either having a bad day or just a total douche bag. Since they don't take res.  And told it's a first come first serve place .. they gave up our table due to not everyone there.  His explanation was one of the rudest. Being the one that was late  due to work and caused the table to be given up , I asked to speak to him myself. This where the name douche bag comes in. Never once did he introduce himself after I did to him .  I even mention hey first time here didn't know the policy but due to trying to find another place to eat that would sit 10 of us jokily I said well we will be in bar. Be nice you guys pick up the first round for 4 of us. You would of thought I asked for the world. He gave me a dirty look and said fat chance. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Unlike Aftyon who made the wait worth it along with Jason. I highly will not be back. Being in the retail business I will be sure to mention this place in a negative way. I'm sure the food is awesome. But the mgr DAN MAYBE SHOULD TAKE A CUSTOMER SERVICE CLASS"}
{"text":"I've been to this Cheddar's numerous times since it opened, and always had decent service and delicious food. However, my boyfriend and I walked in last Sunday afternoon around 5 pm, and the hostess told us just to pick out a seat in the bar area. No big deal so far, I've done this plenty of times. Typically when you sit down, someone comes over to bring you menus and take your drink order. We sit there more than 5 minutes, and no less that 3 different waiters/waitresses walked by our table without making eye contact or acknowledging our presence. At one point, a waiter tried to serve us food meant for someone else, and when we told him we had just sat down, he simply walked off. While the restaurant had a decent crowd, it was hardly busy. After almost 10 minutes of not being acknowledged, my boyfriend and I leave, walking right by a manager, who was behind the bar talking to two other employees. We walked out the door without anyone saying a word to us. We drove down the road to Logan's and had fantastic, fast service and a delicious meal. I usually enjoy Cheddar's and am sad to say that I will not be back to this location for quite a while."}
{"text":"This place is nice inside huge plus. I got the sirloin steak with half a rack of bbq ribs... So good. Steak was perfect and tender and really good flavor. The ribs fell off the bone, and the sauce, yummy! Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with my daughter who was visiting from back east and was so disappointed!  We ordered the loaded taco chips without jalapeños and there was huge chunks on to and all the waitress said was she ordered them without and although we barely touched them she never offered to remove the item from the bill.  I asked for tartar sauce for my fried shrimp and she finally brought it at the end of the meal 20 minutes later!!!  Sad thing is it wasn't that busy!!!   I'll just say never again!"}
{"text":"Great food. All home made. Ask for Karen as your server. She is a sweetheart. Ben the manager was very helpful as well. The portions are good size and priced right. They have a lot of great drinks at the bar too. Parking was a bit crowed and tough to get around. There is a mall parking lot across the drive to handle overflow. We have been there several times and not disappointed. Hope that help."}
{"text":"My wife and I have tried this place now three times to just be fair. As of today we will never return again. It is not the service or the atmosphere because both of those are great. It is the food that is horrible!! Today I had the worst burger I have ever ate and my wife had the buffalo chicken wrap that she didn't like either. After is cause problems for both of us the rest of the day on how it made us feel and truthfully went right through both of us.
The food is just horrible no matter what you get. Sorry cheddar. We love the way it looks, we love the atmosphere, we love the service, but the food is horrible!"}
{"text":"University blvd Charlotte nc...Cheddars... service and food was no way pleasing! I have tried this one twice and was very displeased..........The Cheddars in Gastonia is much better..."}
{"text":"Excellent food and a great price. They really care about customer service and would highly recommend for going on a fun date night."}
{"text":"This location has good food and good service. However they need to work on cleaning the tables before they seat guests."}
{"text":"This place is blah. Food reminiscent of Lubby's Cafeteria. Only come here if you enjoy bland food."}
{"text":"Awesome food for a good price. Although this is my first check in on yelp, this is not my frist time at cheddars. This is my second time at this location but have been to Cheddars on numerous occasions when I lived in Dallas. The service has definitely improved since they opened in Chandler. I usually order the grilled chicken pecan salad. Their alcoholic beverages are a great value as well. If you want good food at a good price, give them a try."}
{"text":"Be careful when using a card. They charged my friends card multiple times. After three attempts to fix the issue with managers, and corporate contact Cheddar's not once apologized, or fixed the issue. Thankfully she was able to get it fixed through her bank; however, still sad to witness. The food is good, would suggest to pay in cash."}
{"text":"Go somewhere else!  Husband ordered steak, i ordered chicken nachos...much later, our food came out...cold...and the nachos were beef.  The waitress appologized but i kept them because we were ready to just eat and get out of there...i asked for extra sour cream...it never came and she never refilled my drink...yet she refilled my husbands drink and stopped by the table every 5 seconds to appologize even though i had assured her we were fine...it became embarassing.  She saw i had basically scraped the 12 nachos clean and dipped them in the salsa so she took it off our bill...when we left, my husband said \"well, where would you like me to take you to eat?\"..he did not enjoy his food because he felt guilty about mine:("}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant two stars only because my meal was delicious.  The service was lousy.  Our waitress never smiled, she failed to refill water, soda, wine.  She did not ask how the meal was.  We asked for a box which she forgot and when we said never mind about the box after ten minutes or so she did not even comment.  I left a tiny tip which she barely deserved.  Horrible service."}
{"text":"Service was lousy. Food is fried and so unhealthy. I ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich and our waitress didn't even know the difference between CHEDDAR or American cheese!!! Nobody makes a grilled cheese with oily cheddar cheese! Come on! It was disgusting."}
{"text":"First timers here & we were pretty happy. 
In a party of 6 and started with the spinach dip app and Texas Cheese fries were a pretty good kick off to a good meal. 

Our entree's were: Monte Cristo which was delicious but with a bit too much breading out balancing the inside, the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich, a little salty but good, the grilled salmon was excellent, fried fish and shrimp was devoured in minutes and Lastly, the 14oz sirloin was so good, ordered medium rare and as I was cutting pieces of it they were disappearing into other plates, I had too many roaming forks stealing pieces of a great steak, tender, juicy, flavorful and this evenings winner for us.  

Our waitress, Jordan, provided satisfactory service to start then it became better service as she appeared to loosen up from her earlier kinda robotic first impression. Overall, I'll be back again from SoCal in my visits to my Dad. Thank You."}
{"text":"My family went here for lunch. The waiter was very good. The food was ok. When I heard it was scratch made I guess I expected a little more of wow. 

My sons hamburger looked very good and he said he liked it. My side salad had a huge lettuce core in it. So I guess I got scratch."}
{"text":"Today is the first time going to this restaurant and I was greeted by a employee that appeared to be in management, hopefully he is not a manager because his attitude was horrid. I will not be returning. John whom served us was great but had a bad vibe from the previous person."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants to eat in Chandler! I bring all my friends and family here that are visiting from out of town. The chicken tenders are amazing!!! Ive also had the shrimp, they were very good as well. Drinks were great and reasonably priced. Great drink specials as well. The ambient is perfect for drinks, food and a intimate dark atmosphere. Love it!"}
{"text":"Love the food, but my last visit was not so pleasant. The waitress did not give us refills even though three of us were empty when she brought appetizers. This happens everytime I go there, you have to ask for refills since the waitress isn't paying attention."}
{"text":"I met the hubs for lunch yesterday on the recommendation of a coworker ,who said they were great AND affordable.  Turns out she was spot on.  We were seated immediately (lunch hour was just hiding its stride) and our waitress was at our table within minutes.  I decided on the Grilled Chicken salad with Walnuts and the man ordered a spicy pasta dish.  Our food was out super fast! I thoroughly enjoyed my salad and can vouch that the pasta dish was just as tasty.  Our lunch meal only came to $20 and some change.  Looks my husband and I will have to trade in our local Applebee's lunch date for Cheddars!"}
{"text":"Don't understand the average rating this place is getting. The food is great and really taste like a home cooked meal. Prices are very surprising being in chandler. You can eat good and won't go broke. First thing to order is a Painkiller with croissants to start. Go for just drinks and sit at bar to watch fish do some weird shit"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! I have been to chedder's in other locations but I was new to this location. I met my boyfriend here when he got off work. It took them a few minutes to seat us, but that was expected seeing as it was right at dinner time. They seated us in the back of the restaurant and my boyfriend and I both noticed an awful smell. I think something in the dining room may have soured. Other then the smell it was a great experience with yummy good and excellent service."}
{"text":"New spot in Gastonia..yummy food & great prices.
Expect to have a long wait for a table.. its crazy busy 
Cop a spot @ the bar & have a cocktail...I suggest the \"the painkiller\"
Awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay food. Terrible service. Hostess should be fired. Only gave the 2 stars to the food!"}
{"text":"First time here and I was really impressed. Not only was the food good, service was a well. The icing in the cake, the prices were very reasonable compared to resteraunts like it... And the portions were really good! One the flip side, there was this manager who had the loudest voice! Talking to one her her \"regulars\" about this and that and purses she makes, about how she was moving,  and so on and so forth. It was a more than a little annoying. I guess I wouldn't expect to hear the entire conversation even with everything else that was going on. But all in all, I'll go back. Maybe next time she won't have so much to talk about."}
{"text":"I have been to Cheddar's in Texas a few times. I have been here twice  since this location has opened. 
 I figured I should go here twice before I review. 
In the first experience was the first day. We got seated pretty quickly,  they had a lot of help from trainers and such.  We got the queso w/ beef. Pretty good. The lemon chicken I ordered  wasn't really lemony. But it tasted good so no worries. The only problem with the first experience was the waiter almost forgot to pick up my card to run it. Overall that experience was a 4. 
Today, I went with my mom to relive our Texan days.  Sadly this experience was not so hot. The buzzers didn't work and they had to yell our name to get our table. Our waitress was horrendous. She kept up selling ( I understand that is part of the job), but when we both said, I we don't drink we do not want a painkiller.  But she also asked 3 times if we wanted appetizers when we stated we did not want them. It took a good half hour to get our food, without getting a refill. We saw the other waiters who were doing a great job keeping their  tables happy. When we did see her we asked for our check. No asking if we wanted a desert or if we wanted a box... 
She came pretty quick back with a check. 
That experience was a 2. I understand they are newly open,and that explains the buzzer things. But no refills and getting drinks quickly especially in Arizona is a big part. I am just glad they opened in March and not in June. 

Overall 
Food- 4 (my mom didn't like her Texas toast moist from the food).
Service- 3 ( From what I watched most of the waiters were on their tables pretty even, just not mine). 
Atmosphere- 5 Clean and nice. 

I would also say, we had waiters pretty close to our tables all the times having conversations with each others the entire time. It was kind of off putting to know about their life when maybe someone might of wanted something?"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Cheddars and my husband's first. I ate here 2 weeks ago with friends for lunch and they were all pleased with their food. Cheddars calls itself a \"scratch\" kitchen since everything is freshly made. I had ribs, loaded baked potato, and cole slaw and my husband had the mango miso salmon with rice & broccoli.  The ribs were slightly overcooked but tasted great and the other food exceeded our expectations. The price was very affordable $10.70 for the ribs and $9 for the salmon. We shared the apple crisp ala mode ($5)which was delicious, but too large for us to eat. Next time I think I will order their \"Painkiller cocktail.\" The wait staff were friendly and helpful and the ambience, warm and inviting. I have decided that this is our new go to restaurant."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and attentive... Food is great and portions are big... Love this place!"}
{"text":"Try the Spagania or the buffalo chick wrap
Good food and service!
Great alcohol selection too!
fair prices
No calling ahead and expect a wait after 530-600ish"}
{"text":"Not the first time I've been to Cheddar's, but it's probably the last time. For touting itself as a scratch kitchen, I guess my expectations were high.  The food wasn't awful, but it wasn't great either. The menu was not enticing at all. Service was good though."}
{"text":"Good service and good food.  Ariel took very good care of us, shared a laugh about our experience at Romano's across I-85 and how we ended up here.  First time dinning here, may have to stop in again on our way back home."}
{"text":"This restaurant originates from Texas and they have some of the best chicken tenders I have ever had. If you are from Texas and a fan of shiner which you can't get in too many places, they serve shiner here. The restaurant is new and so there are some kinks with the wait staff but that is to be expected. The pricing is really reasonable and the atmosphere is nice, I wouldn't call it \"swank\" but definately on par with your Outback or Texas Roadhouse type chain."}
{"text":"I know they just opened and they have to work out the kinks but I am having a hard time justifying going back. My party of five had such a hard time we actually spoke to the GM who was there that night.  The manager was absolutely rude to the point our waiter apologized for his behavior.  Other then I think the waiter wants his position he came back to our table to talk with us about the managers response to two of my party disliking their food and brought over the GM. For the waiter to notice the managers behavior should tell you something.

So the story, our wait time was 15 minutes less then we were quoted.  We ordered our food, the fun part!  We had a chicken tender meal, two chicken fried steaks and two Cajun pasta's. The pasta's came cold and they were sent back. We were under the impression the we're making fresh food but it came back so quickly it obviously was the same. The noodles were over cooked.  This is when the manager came by and asked if it was better. They said yes because it was hot. Then after two bites they couldn't eat it because it was mush. The manager came back then got rude because they had originally said it was good. They were referring to the temperature. He actually argued with my party and basically called them liars.

Okay, chicken strips I was told were chicken strips. My chicken fried steak was actually okay but nothing to write home about so don't get okay confused with a craving.

Needless to say both pastas are now off the bill and they have lost their appetites. They were offered dessert and we were given our bill.  Bill paid and still waiting for dessert. After 15+ minutes I told the people next to us they could have our dessert and we left.

Hope they get there groove on but I'm not so sure I will be back."}
{"text":"I have never visited a Cheddars before, but I must say, I can definitely see myself being a regular here. 

First, the bad:  The restaurant has only been open for three weeks, and it showed in many ways, but my overall experience was a good one. We went on a Thursday night, and there was  25-30 minute wait to be seated. There were a few empty tables on the patio, but apparently not enough waitstaff on duty to cover them. The hostesses were a bit...immature? Our buzzer device went off to signal that our table was ready, but when we went inside, we found that another waitress had given our table to a different party. They did apologize profusely and get us another table within a few minutes. During that time, a guest came up and thrust two soaking wet menus at one of the hostesses and declared that they had spilled their drinks on them. The hostess could not seem to comprehend how to handle the matter, and told the hostess beside her that it was, \"totally disgusting!\" Which it might have been, but she could have handled it with more grace and tact while customers where within easy earshot. I think what I witnessed was mostly growing pains for a place that hasn't had time yet for the .to get a sense of rhythm and teamwork--and I think once that happens, these problems will disappear entirely

The good:  The atmosphere is fantastic. For a place that says it is a casual cafe, it has more of an upscale feel to it. Our party of six each ordered a different item, and we were all more than pleased with both the pricing and quality of the food. Our waiter Justin was friendly and personable and kept on top of refills and checked on us often enough to be efficient without being annoying. The manager came out and chatted with us at the end of our meal to check on how felt about our dining experience, and assured us that any hiccups they were currently experiencing would be smoothed out very quickly.

I would definitely go back--it seems like a good place for happy hour, too, with a separate bar area.  If you are wary because of the other reviews, I would say to wait a couple of months before giving it a try to give them a chance to work out the kinks in the service."}
{"text":"I love coming here for lunch during the week and sitting at the bar.  The service is great and they have given me several delicious food item suggestions that have become my favorites - The Caesar pasta salad with salmon is fantastic. Easily four stars () on these days.

Today, however, I was able to sit in the bar AREA after waiting over 15minutes for someone to clean off three available tables.  The manager was not friendly when I asked about a table being cleared and that was disappointing.  My waitress was friendly and provided good service.  It's just the overall vibe was different.  I get my food and my shrimp hadn't be cleaned properly! Item returned and they give me chicken instead of salmon.  I'm too done.  Spoke to the manager and said to forget it.  I wasted 45 minutes and still had not one bite of food. 

Plus they really need to do something about those slate floors. I'm surprised more people haven't slipped.

Rule of thumb: Don't come here on a Sunday.  I'll be back during the week when I know the service is better."}
{"text":"In town for a sports event.   Read other reviews but was presently surprised. The service was very good.  Out server was a young man (about 18). He was nice and attentive. Food came out quickly and was good.  My son said the his stake was excellent   Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Good food, not so pricey but it can get real busy, people waited for a hour or so, but worth it.."}
{"text":"I love Cheddars. Good food, especially the croissants. Cheap. High quality service. Always a nice crowd. Drinks are good too."}
{"text":"I am writing my review on the new Cheddars in Gastonia NC. This place is impossible to get in most of the time. But it is worth it. We have had dinner as well as lunch on different occasions both were great. Yesterday we had late lunch, husband had mushroom burger and I had chicken tender basket, both were great and very big. We had a spinach dip , very good. We splurged on the monster cookie, even better the check was under 30 dollars. Highly recommend....."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Grilled Tilapia with mango salsa comes on bed of rice and shrimp with two sides, extremely good, works well for the healthy eaters...chicken pot pie was to die for...Steak was cooked perfectly, lacks a little on the flavor side (comparing to outback )..always clean and laid back atmosphere"}
{"text":"The One and only time I ate here there were flys, spilled food on the floor, and it took 45 mins longer than when we got our real for my friends daughter to get her chicken nuggets after we all finished eating..terrible"}
{"text":"This was the absolute WORST dining experience my husband and I have ever had! We will not go back and definitely do not recommend. The service sucks! We ordered alcoholic beverages before we placed our food order and we didn't get the drinks until we were almost done eating our food, and when the waitress brought the drinks she spilled half of my husband's drink all over him and didn't even say a word!! She just walked off. How rude! She could have at least offered to get him another drink instead of making him pay full price for the one he was wearing half of because of her. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Good Food. Great Atmosphere. Nice Staff. The Steak and Shrimp was cooked perfectly. The sides of Broccoli Cheese Casserole & Homemade Red Beans & Rice were delicious."}
{"text":"Not as good as the originals in the south my gf refused to go back and I try to beg her as cheeders in Mississippi is the place I asked her out so I like going back on that Specific da. We used to go every 16th till we moved"}
{"text":"I have been going to chedders for three years and used to love them. But for the past year and a half dinner has been HORRIBLE!!!!!! 
After my first bad experience I tried to give them a chance by ordering my food to go on the way to work. I called ahead and put in my order 30 prior and was told the food would be ready in 20 minutes. Once I arrived I stood there and waited for about 35 minutes which mad me late for work. Then when I spoke with the manager to tell him my complaint I was told that's just how things are when they are busy.
My last and final experience I ordered a chicken pot pie which turned out to be undercooked and my rolls were burnt. 
I will never give this restaurant another chance. And would NOT recommend it"}
{"text":"Im going to start off with the food. I ordered the talapia topped with mango salsa with a side of steamed broccoli and \"country style green beans\". The tilapia was average and it came with baby grilled shrimp on top. The mango salsa was horrible. The mango didnt even taste like mango. The rice that it came over was definitely pre-packaged and gross. The green beans were CANNED. What kind of restaurant serves canned vegetables?!? The broccoli was steamed so you cant really mess that up too badly. They only have four draft beers, bud, bud light, miller light, and yuengling. YAWN! 
The service was not very good. Checked on me twice before my food even arrived, which was annoying, and never checked on me after i got my food until i was obviously finished. Just saw him standing next to the bar chit chatting with coworkers. He didnt even have the patience to wait til i left to take the checkbook. As soon as i closed it, he made sure to come right over to take it. I was there by myself so i wasnt trying to stay long at all. Didnt even get a thank you. Ungrateful jerk. 
All in all, im never going to Cheddars ever again and recommending people to never go there."}
{"text":"Omg! I literally waited 40 minutes for 2 damn bowls of soup! 40 minutes not a meal, soup! This place is a dump to say the least no customer service whatsoever! ......still waiting!!! I stood at the bar for 40mins.. smells like a mix uncleaned stench of old dry liquor and bathed gnats! Disgusting!!! Oh and the glassware yea I watched how they \"wash\" their glasses, I'm not surprised if anyone hasn't gotten sick drinking or eating here! They literally submerged a glass in barely in each sinks of the 3. I've worked food industry and this is not how it's suppose to be sanitized! The manager some incompetent guy who behaves like a pal to his employees and not a leader! Omg worst service over received in such a long time!!!!  After seeing all that I just wanted my money back couldn't even get the manager to come to me never came!!! Just left! I'm disgusted and irked that I threw away $8.58"}
{"text":"The food is excellent as always. The staff are helpful and pleasant. You can't beat the prices or the quality of the food. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Love this place! The chicken fingers are amazing! The New Orleans poster yummm. Service good!"}
{"text":"We went there on a Friday night about two weeks after they opened. Yes, it was busy! Waited about 40 minutes to be seated. Once seated, we were served right away...with a smile. 
I ordered the fish and chips. I was very impressed by the size of the order, the presentation, and most of all the taste. Excellent!! Very moist and flaky, with a perfect crusty exterior."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant for dinner last week with two girlfriends. I ordered the Hawaiian chicken sandwich with the broccoli and cheese casserole. Our food was served quickly and hot. Our server was friendly and attentive. I have visited this restaurant many times in the past and have alway had a good experience. I would definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"This place is great!!! Everytime I go there I have to take half the food home. The portions are generous, delicious and the service is exceptional. Our waitress was Kerry last time and she did a wonderful job."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good and the atmosphere is very nice. It's very fairly priced and portions are generous. One of the best chain or franchise places to go."}
{"text":"We absolutely love the good. The buttered croissants are deliciousness. Salads are perfection. The tower of onion rings are also a must. However....
The wait seems to be unbelievably long every time. But there are tables always empty. They need some organization."}
{"text":"We arrived for an after-church lunch. The restaurant quickly filled after we arrived.

I had the grilled fish tacos with a side of steamed broccoli. The fish was seasoned and grilled nicely. My kids ordered burgers and chicken tenders. They said that the burgers were tasty and the chicken tenders were \"really good!\"

The service was... Not good! I won't way that it was terrible -- because I have had worse -- but it was REALLY not good! Our server came across as not really wanting to be there (he uttered out a very dry \"Uh, welcome to Cheddars\").  He wasn't rude, just not very personable (little to no eye contact).

I overheard the server tell patrons at the next table that the kitchen was out of small plates and spoons... Really?! It's not like the restaurant had been open all day. It's hard to see a restaurant running out of small plates and spoons at noon. 

Overall, good portions & good prices. The food is decent, but the service needs help."}
{"text":"It's not often I am so disappointed in a place of business. I will definitely never visit this restaurant again. We stood near the hostess stand for nearly 5 minutes before anyone even greeted us. Our food took about 3 times longer to be served than it should have. Being vegan and gluten-free, I had no options other than a very plain, dry salad. None of the dishes I inquired about could be modified, because apparently they all come pre-packaged. Pathetic!!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was exactly what I needed that day.  Good comfort food and very filling.  They had a lot of menu options but I went with the Country Style Chicken Fried Chicken w/ mashed potatoes and macaroni & cheese.  It was really good and the portion was huge so I had lunch the next day.

The service was pretty good, waitress was very nice, attentive and didn't do anything wrong.  She did fail to remove dishes like appetizer plates and old glasses when she brought refills but that's being sort of picky."}
{"text":"Went to Cheddars for the first time on Mother's day. Boy was I surprised! The food was great and they have a great Margarita for only $3! I highly recommend the ribs and the chicken strips. You get a ton of food for a reasonable price. To die for are the croissants, you must get them and take them home with you to love on later!"}
{"text":"First impression of this restaurant was: comfortable, casual. Our server was lovely. But this place is a hot mess. We were seated at 7:30 and waited 30 minutes for our cocktail order. At 8:30 we asked to speak to manager. Our meals arrived at 8:40.  We should have left bc what they brought out was pure slop. The \"Cajun Alfredo Pasta\" was disgusting. I am giving them one star because one meal, (fried catfish) was good. They may serve somethings well here, but stay away from the pasta! I just don't know why it took more than a hour to serve a lousy dish that was not even fresh!"}
{"text":"This place has some good food. I ordered chicken fingers and onion rings;they were delicious. It was made better by the fact out server Matthew was so attentive. He was one of the best servers I've had. Definitely try this place!!"}
{"text":"If I had received the bizarre Monte Cristo sandwich I was served out of a Star Trek replicator, I would have called the mechanic. It was a doughnut sandwich worthy of the most deep fried of state fairs. Had it been served at a fair on a stick, it would have been an amusing oddity.
Our surly waiter clearly hated his job and stomped around morosely, so we didn't dare say anything about it. My advice based on what we were served at out table: if you are going to brag about \"cooking from scratch,\" you should at least make sure your cooks can actually cook. And the aggression level of both our waiter and the manager was high-middling to just plain high.  Based upon how we were treated, the waiter and manager made it very clear in a number of ways that they would probably be happy if we never again darken any Cheddar's door. Since I can't imagine any circumstance which would cause us to return to any Cheddar's at any location, it worked out for us all in the end."}
{"text":"Very good and not expensive at all. This one was close to five stars. Almost always get the tenders and sirloin meal. Steak isnt the most tender, but for 14 bucks it is hard to beat. Mac and cheese is a must try."}
{"text":"Pretty standard fare! Nothing our party had popped out with \" OMG you have to try this\" just classic, safe American food! Good for a family night out!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. Prices are very reasonable. I ordered chicken and shrimp. It came with rice and two sides, which is more than enough food food one person and it was right around $10. My husband ordered the club sandwich for $8, great value and great portion size. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Directed toward vegetarians:

First off, Steve S reviewed their Veggie Burger a couple of months ago.  This was not on the menu when I went there (sometime last year), and is not on their online menu now.  Not sure what that means.

As far as the menu I am familiar with, a vegetarian can survive here, but its not pretty.  I had to order a plate of sides.  At some places this can be a blessing, but not here, as their sides are extremely bland, and are of the soggy-veggies/starchy sort.

Service was adequate, though not great.  Decor was typical of Applebee's, etc. type places.

Ultimately, not vegetarian friendly, but not a nightmare."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Cheddars years ago in Overland Park KS and here in Chandler. In KS I found the food too salty but in Chandler it is less salty so much better. I like eating here: good prices, good food and excellent wait staff.  I eat healthier food so I recommend the under 500 calorie dishes and the regular salmon entry."}
{"text":"Normally I would give cheddar's a higher rating but tonight the service was absolutely slow and horrendous!! We got a seat at the high top in the bar and waited for 15 minutes for someone to greet us! We ordered drinks when she greeted us and then waited again for another 20 minutes before water and a menu was brought over! Still no drinks in sight or being made at the bar.. spoke to a manager who did nothing and offered us nothing for the slow service! He didn't apologize instead he only made excuses about the computers crashing! Regardless of computers crashing or not, servers should greet their guests within a timely manner! It is a shame that it will be a while before I return!!"}
{"text":"First time at Cheddar's last night. Walked in and didn't really know what to expect. Had more of an upscale feel than a lot of chain's. We were greeted and seated promptly. Waitress was average, but the food was good and the prices were better than we expected. We got the queso appetizer, and burgers. Would definitely go again and next time bring the kids."}
{"text":"My husband has been bugging me for weeks to come here.

When we walked up to the restaurant, there were a lot of people sitting outside.  We expected to wait for about 30 mins but was pleasantly surprised when we were seated right away. There were 3 in our party.

The service was great.  The food was perfect.  Strangely enough, despite the restaurant being packed, I could hear my husband and son talking without a struggle. 

My son had the kid's meal - chicken tenders with mac and cheese - he loved it.  He finished his plate and told us he was full.  Which is amazing since he never seems to fill up.

I had the grilled salmon (blackened) at the server's recommendation.  It was perfect.  My sides were the broccoli and cheddar casserole (delicious) and potatoes (ok...I'll pick a different side next time).

My husband had the New Orleans pasta.  A hearty dish. A lot of sausage and shrimp.  Spicy though.  

Meals averaged around $10 give or take a few dollars.  The kid's meals are $4.99 including drink.

I was impressed with the food and service and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Cheddar's dedication to making everything on your plate from scratch really pays off. Everything from the cheese bites and French fries to the salads and steaks had a little something special that I can only describe as made with passion. The friendly staff and getting handed a freshly baked cookie from the chef really took my first time dining experience over the top. 
Thanks team."}
{"text":"The prices of the wonderful drinks are what keep me coming back. Reasonably priced and well made. The Maui Margarita is my favorite. Although I have yet to finish one they are delicious!"}
{"text":"The staff was amazing. My family went there for Mother's Day. I think it was a franchise being that we complimented the waitress on how amazing she was and she introduced her grandfather to us. My brother ended up getting Hurt on one of the heavy car seat bassinet thing and my grandma was kind of making a scene to say the least. They gave us TWO FREE appetizers. Because they felt bad. We decided to be seated outside since it was a shorter wait. In my opinion event the outside seating was great because they have misters EVERYWHERE! And living in Arizona that is greatly appreciated. The desserts are very cheap for what they give you. We got a hot fudge sundae cake and a monster cookie. They were both HUGE and delicious!"}
{"text":"Cheddar never disappoints!! They have great quality food and amazing service. I highly recommend this place for a nice date night dinner."}
{"text":"First time at this joint....decided to have birthday dinner for my mother in law....and the verdict....LOVED IT! Started easy with chips and queso as well as the spinach dip, which were both awesome starters. Why didn't anyone tell us that  they had awesome croissants????!!! It's not on the menu, but you can order a side of 3 (they make it with crack...or some other addictive substance, like honey butter). We also ordered the margaritas, strawberry and the Maui...well MAAAAAHALO! So damn, Ono (delicious)! Then came the Redfish, salmon, chicken fried chicken and chicken tenders. Stick a fork in us coz we're done!!!! Had to tap out when I had to unbutton my shorts. Astrid was our server and she's nothing short of amazing. Thank you, Cheddar's....we'll see you next week!"}
{"text":"The only thing nice about Cheddar's is the building!  Besides that, what a horrible experience.  We sat at the booths closest to the kitchen all we could hear was a loud female yelling at her staff at the top of her lungs!  Our food took 30 minutes and when it did arrive, both my steak and my husbands steak was burnt!!  We asked for a manager, twice.  When she finally came to the table I could tell by her voice she was the one screaming like a banshee in the kitchen.  She never apologized just took our plates and said we would have new ones right out.  After another 30 minutes we left.  The hostess said nothing to us upon our exit.  We will never return.  The service was horrible! Some hispanic girl with huge eyebrows kept touching our glasses by the rim! YUCKY!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was alright, not great for the price I paid. I went here with two friends. One of my friends is a vegetarian and has been for around 6 months. When we ordered she ordered a vegetable plate and made sure to tell our waitress to make sure there is no meat in her's. When she got her food there was a piece of chicken mixed into the broccoli. We couldn't believe that after asking for no meat there was a piece of meat in the broccoli. The staff was very kind but people shouldn't have to worry about finding meat in their vegetables."}
{"text":"Called to make a to go order and was placed on hold for 16 minutes. Arrived at the restaurant and placed my order in person manager nor staff could give a flying @@@@.

So much for quick service lol

I would like to thank Cheddar's public relation team for reaching out to me and hearing what I had to say about my experience when trying to make a call in order.

They were very apologetic and agreed to look at their call-in process and work on making it better.  Thank you for listening and willingness to take action."}
{"text":"Worst service in the area! We waited 15 minutes for waters then ordered cocktails and our meals. We should have called it a day after the water wait time! We waited 35 minutes for our cocktails only to be told \"the bar was behind\"! Then we waited an additional 30 minutes for our food. When our food arrived we were missing half of our sides. The waitress came over after us sitting there not eating and said \"is something wrong\"? We said we didn't get our mashed potatoes for either plate or our salad. She said \"oh I subbed the potatoes for the salad they must have messed up in the kitchen\". First of all a server should never blame the kitchen and we never asked to sub the sides. She never apologized and the management didn't seem to care either. A man we are assuming was the manager walked by several times and never said a word. We were not the only ones upset either. The table next to us didn't get their drinks until AFTER their food!  On another note the food was decent."}
{"text":"I came for dinner @ 445 pm on a Tuesday. Food was very good but the service was horrible. Hostess was unfriendly and seemed annoyed I didn't want a high top table. My server was friendly but completely absent. Sat with an empty glass for over 10 minutes - twice. Second refill was in a to-go cup along with the check. I got the message. As I passed the hostess on the way out she was staring off in to the distance, without any acknowledgement or farewell. Again at 520, the restaurant was nearly empty, the staff socializing as they performed side work. Can't use the excuse they were busy. 

The burger and potato skin appetizer was very good, and the reason I didn't give a single star. If it weren't for the service I'd happily return. As it stands I will not."}
{"text":"This place is awesome !!!! Kelsey is an amazing server who made our night ! We are going to request her every time now , she's that good ! The food is top of the line for a really really really good price we were surprised when we seen our bill . My boyfriend and I had a double date with our friends and we are FOR SURE making our regular spot from now on , they had it all . great food great service and great prices ! The chicken tenders are cooked to perfection , the painkiller drink is phenomenal ! Request Kelsey she'll make your night !"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good here depending on what you get. They have a good burger, a good monte Cristo, a Tuscan chicken sandwich, and a decent chicken pot pie. There are also a few other tasty items on the menu that are pretty good. There are also some stuff on the menu that I wouldn't eat like the steak. The ambience is pretty good too and since they've opened, it has gotten better. The prices are reasonable as well. Not great, but reasonable."}
{"text":"We arrived at 4:30 in the afternoon, and the parking lot was already full.  We were seated immediately, and our server was prompt, with frequent check-ins.  The food was great and reasonable.  Our only snag was the kitchen was behind, and our food took a really long time to arrive, and one dish was 10 minutes later than the rest of the food.  I really believe this is due to the newness of this location.  Our waitress was very friendly and gave us updates often.  Overall we are still happy with our experience, and will be back."}
{"text":"Great Place BUT...!!!

My wife and I had a great dinner here last night: wonderful food, Tyrell was a very attentive and responsive waiter, loved the room,etc. Then the bill came and what a shock! The cost of my drink order - Jamesons on the rocks had been broken down into two elements: Jameson (2@5.99), and Rocks (2@.95)!!! They had charged me $.95 extra per drink for ICE!

I asked our waiter about the charge ( no hostility - he really did do a fine job, and by this time we were laughing about the very thought of an extra for ice). He was apologetic and, I believe a bit embarrassed to tell us that \" that's just how we have to write up drinks\".  We didn't push it. We were in too good of a mood to get into a wrangle over two bucks. 

Maybe this is something that has been going on for a while and we just haven't noticed, but we've contacted a number of friends about this and so far they are all as slack-jawed about it as we are. I don't remember seeing a notice on the menus of such charges, but then again we weren't looking for it so we could have missed it. 

We'll go again, but next time I'll order my drink neat, and take the ice out of the water glass - or bring my own."}
{"text":"I miss the days of going here when I was at UNCC! The Cookie Monster is the best dessert of all time - don't pass it up because it looks simple, it's so good."}
{"text":"The food was great servuce was wondering if my waiter could be more happy but i loved this place i would go again"}
{"text":"Love their grilled fish, the best croissant and their steam broccoli is the best me and my wife ever had. Our server Matt did a wonderful job.  Too bad there's no Cheddars in our place in LA yet."}
{"text":"Service is cool depending on who your server is. I've been a few times and had a great server and then a really horrible one. Good is not consistent. One time I ordered a cheese burger and the cheese would not melt, it was cold...another ordered a salad and it was delicious. Same thing with the drinks. Their bar area needs a serious upgrade. It has serious potential, but fire the staff with attitudes and no home training first. Just monitor the kind of people you let in. Smdh. The prices are good. Cheap. I guess you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"So happy they came to Arizona. I've been going to cheddars for over twenty years in Texas. The pain killer is my favorite drink! The toasted coconut with honey on the rim is so amazing. You have to try this drink if you go. The prices are so cheap. The cheese dip is so good and they add meat for free. If you haven't tried them your missing out! It's a nice family restaurant. You won't be disappointed. One more thing the plate sizes are Texas sized so you can get an appetizer and then split meal!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant, they have the best food and the prices are fairly reasonable. My food is always cooked to order, especially the salmon."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Good service and decent food. Portions are fairly large and the onion rings are always a fun add on. A good family friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I have great memories of eating at Cheddars in Bolingbrook, IL and I was quite happy to see one in Chandler, AZ.  We have eaten there twice in the three weeks they have been open, one being the day the opened.  The first time we were there again opening night.  They weren't busy which was good.  We shared the Wisconsin Cheese Bites appetizer and they were great!  I ordered their New Orleans Pasta which sounded great on the menu.  When it arrived the noodles were very much over cooked and chicken was dry.  Since it was their first day I politely told the server to let the kitchen know they over cooked the pasta.  My meal was comped no questions asked and was given a free desert.  I was pleased with the server but the kitchen was super slow and really wasn't cooking the food well.  I know it was opening night and we decided we would give them another shot.  We did, three weeks later today.  We ordered the same appetizer and I ordered the chicken fingers and shrimp combo with broccoli cheese casserole and Mac and cheese.  I also requested my chicken fingers to be half classic and the other half BBQ.  The meal came quite quick.  However no broccoli cheese casserole and when it did come it was cold and half the portion it should have been.  They gave me mashed potatoes with gravy on the side which I did not order and my chicken fingers were not BBQ, they were buffalo.  My wife ordered chicken finger and sirloin combo with mashed potatoes and gravy and broccoli cheese casserole and opted to have half of her chicken fingers with garlic Parmesan and the other half classic.  Her ordered arrived with no gravy and honey mustard on the potatoes.  Her broccoli cheese casserole was cold and the chicken fingers were wrong.  Her steak was medium well and was ordered as medium.  The manager corrected the order but the broccoli cheese casserole came back cold again.  Third time was the charm as they finally came back steaming hot.  He comped both combos with no questions asked.  The server we had the first time recognized us and came by and said hello and he knew we were not happy.  He too was unhappy with the way things were going at the restaurant and is already looking for another place to work.  He said the kitchen was ridiculous and all the general manager has done is comped meals left and right.  I definitely caution choosing to eat at this Cheddars because they still have inexperienced cooks in the kitchen."}
{"text":"The only thing I've ever eaten at Cheddars is the Monte Cristo. All negative comments about Cheddars will have to be addressed to my arteries and heart.

For those of you unfamiliar with the Monte Cristo...it is turkey, ham, and cheese slapped between a couple of funnel cakes and fried in some deliciousness. Then they sprinkle some powdered sugar on it. This thing should be called the heart-stopper. 

If you're going to a chain like Cheddars for something healthy...yawn...I ask why. Maybe the complaints about your salad at your favorite restaurant Applebees didn't teach you a lesson. Regardless of what's going on in your dome, this place is for ordering Monte Cristos...capiche?


Try: Using the grease on your hands to manage your split ends

Avoid: Eating your Cristo over anything other than your plate


**After eating your first bite of Cristo...you may inexplicably yell Booyah!"}
{"text":"I visited tonight with a friend. It was a pretty nice restaurant, nice atmosphere and friendly waitresses. The food on the menu is very affordable. The food wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either. I got the miso salmon with ginger rice and steamed broccoli. I would return here again."}
{"text":"We tried to get a large table for a birthday party. We were told there would be a twenty minute for a table. Thirty minutes later we were shown two booths and told that would be the only option as there was a group still at the large table and another party of ten ahead of us. 
Apparently there is no real communication between the front of the restaurant and the back. Pretty poor experience. 
We will not return for poor service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, but the service was HORRIBLE! As a restaurant employee myself, I feel I am more understanding than some because I know how hard the job can be when its busy. However this was not the case tonight. The server was plain and simple being lazy and rude."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place is awesome. My kid loved the fish tank and it just looks like a very nice restaurant without the high price. The Mac and cheese was super good not just the standard Kraft crap. The burger however was over cooked and my pasta had such a nasty flavor along with that dried look like it had been sitting for a while. Did I tell my waiter any of this? Nope. I didn't see him again after he gave us our food. I had to flag down another server just to get my check. For the first time in my life I felt like a dine and dash might be morally acceptable."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is always hot and fresh. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Great prices too!"}
{"text":"Painkiller!!!! All the food is great and very reasonably priced. One of a few great eateries in chandler."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  Herschel our Waiter  was very nice but very slow. My husband received his meal 20 minutes before we did. We did not receive the salad we ordered and the loaded mashed potatoes were wrong. Cheddars has great food but the service was not the best."}
{"text":"So pleasant and fun!! Everyone was so sweet and attentive! Nothing took long. everything was served to us right on time! The spinach dip was delicious and creamy! The shrimp was grilled perfectly and the sauce that came on top of it was amazing! Everything was just great, lost in words. The portion you get for how cheap it is, is just GREAT!! I seriously recommend this place! The manager was very kind and welcoming! Gave us free nice and warm out of the oven delicious cookies at the end of our meal! Very happy with this place, glad we came! Right down the street from us too! They'll definitely be seeing my face here again!"}
{"text":"I use to work here a while ago... Trust me you dont want to eat here, I have seen first hand what goes on in the kitchen. And thats why I quit."}
{"text":"This place is great! I come here a lot. Atmosphere is not bad, and I've only ever noticed one thing you want to keep in mind. They like to forget things! The food will make up for it though. So just keep in mind to be specific if you're wanting to tweak your dish. I recommend the garlic parmesan chicken tenders to fit somewhere on your plate. Don't get the steak/chicken meal though. Another good alternative is some kind of Louisiana pasta they have."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants, food is amazing, atmosphere is awesome, service is great, and prices for food and drinks are amazing. 

That being said, their bartenders really need to learn how to make an alcoholic drink. When we first started going to Cheddars, the drinks were perfect--and we frequented all the time, but the last few months the drinks have been awful. Specifically their soda mixed alcoholic beverages--you're supposed to add a SPLASH of coke, not fill the whole thing up with it.... It has nothing to do with the alcohol content-which is lacking, but it has to do with the taste of the drinks...they're either too overpowering with sweet and sour mix or with too much soda...

We know the drinks are cheap, but that doesn't mean the quality of them should suffer."}
{"text":"It isn't that great of food as people recommended... hard cooked meat and chicken tortilla soup is nasty & They use fake cheese chicken tortilla soup because I was able to pull the cheese out of soup in a clump because of the fake cheese & it doesn't melt... :-("}
{"text":"I liked this place in the beginning but the last few times I went I have found hair in my food.  Nothing makes me lose my appetite faster.  Not going to try for a fourth time. Buy the cooks some hair nets!"}
{"text":"WOW! All I can say is WOW!

I will have to spend 3 hours on the treadmill after this visit!

I was only going to give it 4 stars but then remembered our waiter and the service he gave us so that will have to be 5 stars."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!!  Ordered dinner....waited a half of an hour and was told that they were out of the dish we ordered. We ordered an alternative dish that was served cold (was supposed to be hot). I will not return."}
{"text":"Holy cow!! Their food is delicious! And Joy (our server) was friendly and a real JOY to be around! :)
Will visit again!"}
{"text":"Please don't come here. I don't wish this sort of experience on ANYONE.

I went here for the first time last night expecting a decent night out with my girlfriend, and I was just disappointed. We were told the wait would be 15-20 minutes, we waited 45.
Once we were seated our waiter got my drink order wrong twice. I eventually just left it alone and had a water.
We ordered the chips and queso for an appetizer and mediocre is about the best adjective I'd have for it. The queso had a film over the top of it like it had been sitting for awhile. Although the salsa was actually pretty good.
My girlfriend ordered the steak and chicken tenders, and she said it was average at best. Her mashed potatoes had a giant clump of potato in the middle of it, almost like they didn't mash half a potato. 
I had ordered the lemon pepper chicken, and I have to say it was the worst dish I've ever received in a restaurant. I have NEVER sent a dish back before, but I had to. The chicken was rubbery and bland, the rice was undercooked and had zero seasoning. The best part of it was the green beans. I guess if I had any sort of recommendation from this place it would be the green beans.
I would expect this sort of experience from a place like Boston market or something, but for me to go out to dinner and spend $50, I'm expecting something better than this. 
If you're thinking of coming here for something new, don't bother. Awful food, mediocre service."}
{"text":"Im a big fan of Cheddars.  Although I don't live in the area I always try to visit when I'm here.  The portion sizes are big enough to split a plate between two people.  The child order of chicken tenders is more than enough for an adult.

Every meal I've tried I have enjoyed from the baby back ribs, burgers and buffula wraps to the salads.  Cheddars is clean and I love the decor.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This place is a family favorite. It's always packed when we go; it put two restaurants out of business b/c no one could beat their prices. If you ever want to go anywhere for a decent meal, good portions, etc this is the place for you. They have everything! I do not work for the company nor was I paid to write this review, I swear!"}
{"text":"Amazing food at a great price! And those honey icing  croissants, yum  

Cheddars offers a variety of chicken, steak, pasta, fish, ribs and/or a combination of these entrees. You can also choose two sides and I would highly recommend the Mac n cheese as a side dish. As a family, we have tried most of the entrees.  I have had to return both the lemon pepper chicken and sirloin steak due to overcooking. Both times, we were given a replacement meal and the chef came to our table to be sure that we were happy with our replacement. Very professional and appreciated.

The atmosphere is very cozy and they have plenty of large booths for larger groups."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everything I've ordered has always been good, chicken pot pie, shrimp, chicken tenders, salmon, soup. The food really tastes like its made from scratch. And the service has always been great, they know how to train their staff!"}
{"text":"I have been waiting for this place to open for a while now, so as soon as I found out it was finally open I cancelled my dinner plans and came here instead. 
Being opening week I know not to expect the service to be perfect so my 4 stars are only for the food. If I had to rate the service there would most definitely be less stars. These people are running around like chickens with their heads cut off. They kept bringing people things they never ordered multiple times,  and the waiter didn't even know what sodas they had.
On to the food, my boyfriend ordered the half rack of ribs with the chicken tenders. The ribs were so delicious, they were juicy and the meat fell off the bone. 
We got my son the grill chicken kids meal. It came with rice and we got the mac and cheese for the side. My son loved the mac and cheese, he ate the whole thing! The grill chicken was cooked perfect, which was awesome because they normally over cook it in almost every restaurant we go to. 
And last, I eventually got the 50/50 tenders half original and half buffalo with mash potatoes and corn. They messed up my order at first, they only gave me buffalo tenders so instead of taking some of my buffalo tenders away and bringing me a couple of original tenders later. I had to wait 15 mins for them to make me original tenders and when they were finally done they just heated up my buffalo tenders so they didn't taste so good. You can tell they were reheated. The original tenders were good they were juicy and crispy on the outside.  Nothing special about the corn or mashpotatos though, I expected them to be better since everything is made from scratch. 
I also got a salad which the waiter forgot to give us, we got it after we had gotten our meals. The salad was really cold, and I felt like I bit into ice when I ate the tomatoes.  Not nearly enough dressing either and since our waiter was Mia after the mess up,  I just didn't eat it.
Overall other than my buffalo tenders, the food tasted Like the previous chaddars that I have been to in texas which is the reason why I was so excited to begin with. Hopefully when I go back everyone has been trained and the service is as good as the food."}
{"text":"This place is great! Went there and we immediately got a table. We were served by Emily and she was awesome! She was quick and very personable. Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"My friend and I enjoyed a wonderful lunch there today.  We had the vegetable plate, salad, & Monte Cristo sandwich.  I haven't had as delicious a Monte Cristo since my first one at the Gold Mine in Syracuse, NY!  The Mac & cheese had macaroni that was too soft but good flavor.  The steamed broccoli was done to perfection as was the broccoli casserole.  The apple yogurt salad was enjoyable.  The biggest surprise was the salad... Traditional mix!!  The blue cheese dressing was Very good and the vinegrett was well flavored.  Reasonably priced with a cosy atmosphere and a large patio, families and couples can enjoy a meal here."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been there many times and I have never been dissapointed by the food! The service is hit or miss but thats what to-go is for!"}
{"text":"I use to live in Missouri and our favorite restaurant was always Cheddar's.  I was so excited to see them come to the valley.  They have a great menu. The food is big on portion size, cooked to perfection and I have never had a bad meal or drink there. The pricing is very favorable and I have always found their staff to provide excellent service.  Get there early in evenings as they usually have a wait but it is well worth it.  Definitely get their cookie dessert. Delicious."}
{"text":"The food was great. It was extremely busy so it took a while for service but the server was extremely kind, funny & attentive. Tried the cheese steak sandwich & it was very good. I usually get chicken fingers or bacon cheeseburger from here. My friend had the pot pie & it was delicious (even though I don't like the gravy/sauce it had, was still very home tasting)."}
{"text":"I just recently went to Cheddar's with my parents during my trip to Charlotte. My parents had had nothing but great things to say about the food and the service and they went on the recommendation of my cousins who always stop by on their way through town also. We went on Mother's day so I was expecting a long wait. (They don't take reservations or call-ahead seating). Surprisingly we were seated immediately. Our waiter was prompt and friendly. He knew quite a bit about the menu items and made several helpful suggestions. I had a bite (well, more than a bite) off everyone's plate and everything was excellent! Really great prices too, I don't think anyone's meal cost over $12 and we all left stuffed. From the looks at the other reviews, it appears as if the staff, service, and food have been revamped. I encourage everyone with bad prior reviews to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Poor service! I love the food- in Texas it was a regular spot for us. Here in AZ we come back every 6 months or so because I like the food and forgot how horrible the service is. Tonight will be our last time here!! I will not forget as this has has been the worst service and the manager was not even very friendly or helpful. Be prepared for poor service and plan on extra time because everything takes longer then it should and you even have to ask for drinks refills and remind the server of your order! Plus, know you will be charged for stuff they are out of stock of and didn't even get! Sad sad day to cross Cheddar's off the list if options."}
{"text":"I seriously wish they could get our burgers right! I love this place but its rediculous.  This time i got a half piece of bacon.  I said something because my husbands has the normal bacon everywhere and i was jeleous! So she took it away and brought it back with double tomatoes and no bacon! What lol. Omg!"}
{"text":"The food here was the best.  Everything I ate was incredibly delicious.  The prices are excellent and our server, Lee, was excellent.  I highly recommend it.   I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Cheddar's is a nice place to go to for a nice meal if you want something that's fairly inexpensive and want your monies worth.  I would say sometimes service could be a little better but I have never really had awful service. Cheap drink specials that taste really good. Overall I would say try to go when it's not a busy time you should enjoy it either way though. All the food I have tried I've never really had a bad dish."}
{"text":"Horrible to go service and dirty . Drinks on the ground and my to go water had something in it along with my sour cream."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite place to go to eat. The price is very reasonable and the good is made from scratch. Fresh food and the atmosphere is great. The staff was courteous and professional. I choose to go there every time."}
{"text":"Family has eaten at Cheddar's two or three times now.  I wanted to give this place a 4-star, but it has some problems I'll get to.

First, the prices are great and the portions are very generous.  I love that the fruited lemonade comes with free refills.  I got the bacon cheese burger, and it feels like more than 1/2-pound.  The food I've ordered is always delicious (never gotten a steak) and service is very good.  Our waitress check-in on us regularly and are quick to refill drinks.

But I got three problems, and two maybe nit-picky:
1) Wait & kitchen staff come and go through the main entrance.  It's frustrating to sit and wait for 30-40min while you see staff leaving at the end of their shift.  My complaint isn't that they are going home (everyone needs time with family)... just consider how it looks to the guests when the help is leaving and I am waiting for a seat.  I don't know if that it's handled at other restaurants, but I can't think of another place I've been where the staff come-and-go through the main entrance.

2) My wife is vegetarian (milk and egg products only).  They only have one item that is vegetarian friendly which is the \"spaghana\" ( aka Brick O'Cheesy Pasta).  All the salads come with chicken, which they can take off.... but still charge full price.  Maybe they could price the salads with and without chicken OR come-up with one other vegetarian item?  I know she is not the only vegetarian in Gaston County.

3) Seating is a BIG issue.  The place is always busy and I think I know why.  Tonight we showed up at 4:50pm.  The wait was already out the door and we were told 20-30min.  Problem was two whole sections of the restaurant were completely empty.  They finally started seating the area after 5, but it was too late.... the wait had already grown to 45min.  By the time we left I overheard the hostess telling someone the wait is going to be 95min!  Cheddars.... get more wait/kitchen staff and open up the entire restaurant when you start getting busy so you dont end up with these crazy wait times.

So to summarize:
Pros- Good value, excellent tasting food, reasonable price, large portions, friendly staff, clean restaurant.

Cons - Not vegetarian friendly and horrible wait times that could be avoided."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place out for a while and was super excited my husband agreed to try something new. We were seated within five minutes of getting there. Once we were seated, it took a while for our server to come get our drink order. We ordered the nachos as an appetizer, which took about 15 to 20 minutes to arrive. They were not great but edible. My husband ordered the Monte Cristo and  I ordered the fish and chips with mac n cheese. Shortly after ordering, our server informed us they were out of the Monte Cristo. It was a bit confusing because it's made with basic ingredients right? If it's made from scratch, what could they possibly be out of? He ordered the country fried steak instead. Our meals came and they were good, but nothing that I couldn't live without. Our server seemed less than thrilled to be at work and did the bare minimum to take care of us. I am not the type of person that wants to be waited on hand and foot, but she didn't refill my drink once or take away our appetizer dishes before our food came out. I was so disappointed with our experience today because I've heard so many great things and wanted to really love it. I'm not sure if I will return in the future. Maybe to try the Monte Cristo, if it's available!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has very poor customer service, manager Pam is the worst manger I ever spoke to, rude and arrogant and she in fact said she didn't care what sort of review I write and to go a head and write it. My daughter and a few of her friends were dropped off to enjoy dinner as it was my daughters friends birthday but they were given a beeper #19 and the hostess said the wait is 20-30minutes but after 45minutes later still they were not seated and when I asked to speak to a manager they kept me waiting more than ten minutes finally the second time I was able to speak to the arrogant manager Pam she simply said she can't do anything because they are busy, well then why lie about the wait time? It seems like they lie about the wait time in order get people's business  keeping customers waiting standing in line for over an hour, which would only lead customers to be aggravated and end up with a sour experience, I know that with this bad experience I will make sure my family and friends will never go back to cheddars, hey but \"who cares as the manager Pam says\""}
{"text":"I, too, don't understand the negative comments about Cheddar's.  I have been there several times, and EVERY TIME, the food has been great, and the service has been friendly, fast, and attentive.  This is a casual dining restaurant on par with Chili's, Applebees, Ruby Tuesday, etc.  Of this type restaurant, Cheddar's is my favorite.

Not only is the food good, but prices are very reasonable.  For example, a 23-oz draft beer (Yuengling) is $3.99 here.  Most of the other casual dining restaurants charge $5.99."}
{"text":"Simple review: 
Cheddars = Denny's, Coco's, Marie Calendars.

Cheddars wishes it was : Fridays or Chili's 

Cheddars tries to look like (interior design and ambiance) and will never be in 1bil years Kate Mantelini. If u don't  know what Kate Mantelini is, then you just don't know how far American comfort food has come since 1981

Verbose (Longer) review:
With a copper sign and a name like cheddars  was expecting a lot more, especially when entering cheddars and experiencing the ambiance and interior design., the rotating fans were impressive  as well as the fish tank. 
When we all got the menu, we instantly were transported back to 1989 Chili's or Cocos, jaws dropped, all three of us struggled to comprehend the pairing of food to the motif and name of the restaurant.  

One of us attempted to order something \"cheddar-y\", the Texas fries. Opinion:  tastes like bacon potato wedges from Jack in the Box, although Jack in the box  has softer cheese, making it a bit better.

I ordered the chicken Alfredo: opinion, go to Frys, Ralph's, albertsons or your local market and buy a buitoni frozen pasta, save $4, it's the same thing.

Rosemary Chicken sandwich: way too much mayo, bun was rosemary bread, chicken was blackened to cover up the rubbery texture, meal was not even %50 eaten

In fact all our meals including, the best of the bunch, the chx pot pie, we're only %50 eaten. Not worth the time or sodium

To top it off the appetizer and entrees came out at the same time and the side salads came out 5 min later, wtf?

Never going back"}
{"text":"This place was great!!! We were on vacation and It was so good we ate here twice today.  The service was great and so was the food especially for the price.     Loved it.  We will be trying to find one Close to home."}
{"text":"It was our first time at Cheddar's, but not the last!  The atmosphere was beautiful, our server (Ed) was awesome!  Now, on to the food...It was DELICIOUS!  I had the chicken fried steak and it actually had a REAL STEAK inside the yummy fried coating!  The mashed potatoes and gravy were perfect! And the corn-OMG!!  One of my sons had a bacon cheeseburger and the other had cheese fries.  Both were very happy! My husband enjoyed his steak, and they had two choices of steak sauce too!  We shared a cookie/ice cream concoction of gumminess but next time we're trying the HUGE piece of chocolate cake/ice cream!  Looking forward to going back!  BTW, very reasonably priced.  We got out of there, tip included, for $62."}
{"text":"ALWAYS a good experience when I do go to this location. The food is always pleasant, fresh, and good. The staff is friendly and very attentive to everyone in the restaurant. I seem to order the same thing every time I go which is the Buffalo chicken tenders. My husband had the ribeye steak over the weekend and he really enjoyed it. Overall great local eatery."}
{"text":"Good food nice atmosphere enjoyed my time till i had a waiter i had a problem with he had got up set with a customer and i heard him walking a way caring on with such vulgar my kid was with me i really did not want my kid to hear that kind of talk. Please check your manors of your employees and have some respect for the other folks you are disrupting."}
{"text":"This bonus edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Cheddar's Restaurant in the University area of Charlotte. This casual family restaurant, founded in Arlington, Texas boasts that they want to \"be a great restaurant that serves quality food fresh from the kitchen in a friendly, comfortable atmosphere at a fair price.\" I believe they accomplish this.

For lunch I chose the Homemade Chicken Pot Pie served with a fresh Caesar salad. The Pot Pie was full of chunky chicken, potatoes and vegies, and a tasty cream sauce. The crust was flaky, golden brown, and just the right thickness.

Dora here. Candy pecans, honey lime dressing and a finger-licking-buttery croissant jazzed up an ordinary salad to over-the-top for me, and I could drink a gallon of their unsweet tea.

I would rate this restaurant five forks out of five for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food."}
{"text":"Service is great... Food was ok, wasn't super impressed... Great atmosphere but tastes like chain restaurant frozen food."}
{"text":"It is a very nice and elegant place, but without the high price tags. Friendly and fast service.  We loved the onion rings, the chicken tenders and the steak. But no so much the mashed potatoes. We highly recommend it."}
{"text":"the building on the outside looks really cool, first of all. we walk in, and the inside is cool as well. that along with the fish tanks and the huge 'fan' in the middle of the building, and even the bathrooms help to make the building itself something worth seeing. they were really busy, so in order to get a booth, we had to sit in the Bar. our waitress, Rachel, was awesome. she was friendly and willing to have a converastion and build a rapport with us. for an appetizer we got the onion rings which were really good. my mom and the friend who went with us ordered the lunch portion salmon, blackened, with some of the burbon glaze on the side; and under her recommendation I got the fish and chips. we got our food, and the salmon had the glaze on it instead of on the side. but instead of being cooked with the sauce on it, they seemed to just pour it on after, because it was runny, all over the plate and rice, as well as the spoon on my moms plate! as well as putting the gravy from my friends mashed potatoes on it instead of on the side. My fish, though, were amazing; very possibly the best ive ever had. after some dealing with it, the waitress saw my mom and our friend were unhappy, so we had them remake it. then, thinking very accurately, she asked if we wanted my plate hot-held so we could eat at the same time. our friend often thinks of such, and it is one of his pet peeves; so she then was brilliant at that. when we got our food, we were all extremely happy; they decided to remake my food as well to halp make things as best as possible. my mom and our friend both loved their salmon, and (even though I didn't think it was possible) my second plate was even better! there was so much flavor in my fish I felt like one piece was 2 or 3. when we finished eating we still had lots of food to take home, and then they brought out Croissants! those themselves were so good that even though we [thought] we were full, we ate every last bite.

all in all, the experience was very good, and the food was delicious. and for the price? its definitely worth it. you could easily spend around the same amount at Denny's, Chili's and other such American food restaurants."}
{"text":"Ribs Ribs Ribs Very good! Wife had the Buffalo Chicken Wrap said it was really good but she would not order with the pickles. ..Service was a little over the top but being that the place is brand new you expect that. Seemed like someone was at our table every 5 mins, became annoying.  Overall very happy and would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Cheddar is the best. I love you guys and i come here at least every weekend.
Saniqua P. and Robert M. you guys are just plain horrible.  The biggest whiner in the world and totally yelp trolls and hater with no soul or conscious.  Is yelp becoming a place for complainers? in the old days, in order to write review you have to have some credits. Now with yelp platform, which they use to make money, but some users like Saniqua and Robert mady just use to spread hate toward an individual or business because they didnt get what they want? Seriously
Elite status on yelp because you have alot free time doesnt make you a better person or above anyone.  Telling other people dont go this restaurant or that restaurant or its not worth it , just because you didnt get your ass kiss are just a type of hate? The same kind of hate like hitler ? Robert mady are you a version of Laos hitler? or just a person with no conscience? or no moral? or simply no soul? or no heart? is ?is your head not been awake?
Consciousness is when we feel the suffering of every creature within our hearts. whether it is the waiter that serve you or the manager that couldnt please you or the owner that have to read your stupid reviews. Be a better person.  become a part of the solution.  compliment not critize
When your soul has been awake you wouldnt be on yelp writing all these stupid reviews."}
{"text":"Good portions, reasonable prices. The only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five, is because the waitress spilled my water on me."}
{"text":"My experience with Cheddar's was great. The interior was what I would call \"high-end rustic\". I felt like I could wear a suit and tie or jeans and a nice shirt. The staff was friendly and efficient. Our server checked on us regularly and was very friendly. We'd come back just for the service, but hey. The food was pretty great too. The lemon pepper chicken was delicious. I would recommend this place for business lunches or date night. Come check this place out some time."}
{"text":"I used to eat at Cheddar's all the time when I worked nearby and the food was excellent and the service was stellar. But, the last 3-4 times I've been the service has been terrible. The waitstaff seem irritated to have to wait on you and rarely stop by after your food comes. Today I ate lunch there and the food was great, but it took forever for my waitress to bring me refills or extra things I asked for. The table beside me was served cold food and had to flag down a different waitstaff as our waitress had disappeared. I know I'm the rare person who still pays cash for things, but my waitress didn't bring me back all my change (no coins) so she shorted me over $0.50. The food is excellent and I love their chips and salsa, but the service has gone WAY downhill in the past few years. I truly don't understand waitstaff who seem irritated to have customers - don't you work on tips?!?! I doubt I'll be coming back anymore as the service is so terrible. It's a shame because the food is still really great."}
{"text":"just about the best place ever. first time here and will definitely be back!! everything tasted amazing and the prices were very great. service was awesome too!! 

we had:
onion rings as an appetizer
citrus salmon
chicken tenders
mac and cheese
fries

and now: pizza cookie!!
we both will be back, in fact we will be bringing in the family and bfs too :) highly recommend"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 5 but see pictures below.... we went here for my birthday last night with family and the food was delicious and our service was really good! I ordered an old fashion cocktail and it had orange pulp in it which was very odd. A bartender came to ask me how I liked it and I appreciated that. Everything was good except, I had leftovers and brought my food home. Today, I noticed they dropped a sticker in my food.... I'm not sure if I'll be back because that is just not ok and completely grossed me out."}
{"text":"I always like it here! Love the cheesesteak, burgers, nachos with free beef!!! Croissants with honey butter and cookie skillet!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants because I like southern style food and this is close.  Myself and my coworkers have visited this place a few times and the food is always right and the service is good. I really like the fried shrimp and chicken dinner with mashed potatoes and green beans. Although the chicken is a little bland but I still like it... weird... Their side salads are good too, homemade ranch.  The prices for the amount of food is great.  I have tried their lighter side menu as well.  I like the Sweet heat Chicken and shrimp too."}
{"text":"Good: The food is good, price is very reasonable. Not super fancy but not extremely casual. Perfect place to dress nice and have fun with a group of friends or family. 

Bad: They constantly ran out of clean dishes, the waiter I had was extremely slow, one of my 3 drinks were sent back for being absolutely horrible. El Patron (too salty), don't order an old fashioned, be specific if you want more alcohol than soda. Waiter also forgot my friends soup 3 times and got 2 orders wrong. 

Reason why I am giving 4 stars because this really is an overall good restaurant especially for the price. Highly recomment the Rib eye steak or the New Orleans pasta. Both amazing"}
{"text":"Let's start with the wait time being ridiculous at over an hour and a half. Not that the restaurant was packed because there were so many empty tables. Staff was late causing a major delay... But there were at least 4 hostesses??? The experience was sad to say the least. 

I gave them 1 star because our waiter was working several areas of large parties and still found the time to entertain my high energy toddler. The second star because those chicken tenders were the the most plump and juicy tenders we've ever encountered. That's where the good ended. 

So I'm a sweet tea kind of person and often times tea can be too sweet with it tasting more like sugar water with a hint of tea flavor. This sweet tea had no sugar it actually was slightly less sweet than the unsweetened tea. The food portions and quality was very inconsistent at our table of four. 
We had to order our steaks medium rare to get it close to get it close to medium which still arrived at our table medium well. The shrimp and other seafood just tasted fried. The sides were cheesy or very overcooked.

I will not be returning here. It seemed like a large bar instead of a restaurant. At the price point I didn't expect great but I would have settled for okay. Granted I haven't been to this restaurant in years but it was a major disappointment for the wait. Huge Saturday night mistake."}
{"text":"I love coming here for the ribs! The meat just falls off the bones! Nice place and feels kinda homey. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Amazing! I can't say enough about Cheddars. Decided to try with a friend- we split an onion ring appetizer & both got meals for just over $20 before tip. My meal (buffalo chicken wrap) was great and the portions huge- I brought a lot home for leftovers. The inside is decorated beautifully, we were sat very quickly and the staff was helpful."}
{"text":"Strawberry lemonade great food is usually on point and i use 2 go alot but i went for mothers day and almost every1 knows me but i have a food allergy and it is not equip for that. it took them almost 2 hours  2 seat  a party of 9..an the manger was like do u want to look at the menu while you wait.. who does that i could see a free drink or something but just to look at the menu ..needless to say i havent been back"}
{"text":"I love coming here and I love taking family/friends here because it is so affordable! I've been here many times and I always order the same thing... the Bourbon glazed salmon is to die for. It comes with rice and two sides of your choice. I typically get a side of fries and Mac and cheese. For some reason, my Mac and cheese ALWAYS comes warm and not hot... like it's been sitting in a warmer or something and not made fresh? And same goes for my fries, they never seem to be fresh every time I order them. 

Also, they didn't have much dessert options to choose from. They only have two options if I remember correctly. 

I had to minus .5 stars because of that. But all in all, the food is delicious and the staff are always friendly. 

P.S. order the Honey Butter Croissants!!! Trust me on this one."}
{"text":"It started off good with the triple treat appetizer. Everything on the app was delicious. The Philly cheese steak had awful cheese, the chicken pasta Cesar salad had pasta noodles that were not even cooked, and the medium well steak was sent back 2 times because it was almost raw. The next steak came out of the kitchen more rare than the previous time. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Great for low cost food. Only complaint is they don't have enough normal tables, they mostly have booths which I don't like."}
{"text":"While running errands on a Sunday afternoon I ran across Cheddar's Scratch Kitchen.  My heart smiled because I had no idea there was a Cheddar's in Arizona.  The only time I've ever seen or dined at a Cheddar's was in Dallas, TX.  The minute I saw it I made up my mind to dine there for dinner after running my errands. I ordered the Combo Chicken Tenders and Shrimp with a loaded baked potato and a salad with Honey Mustard Dressing. I've only been to Cheddar's twice and ordered the same thing both times.  I looked over the menu for a while with hopes of trying something new but when the server came to take our order she immediately told us the list of items they were out of for the evening.  I can't remember what they were but I was considering one of them.  They did not however, run out of dinner rolls *smile* 
Good Lord the dinner rolls!

In addition to the few food items they were out of for the evening, they were also out of Strawberry lemonade.  I thought that was pretty strange.  We were able to order one strawberry lemonade for the both of us (my boyfriend and I) but when we asked for refills they were all out.  Bummer!"}
{"text":"Great service the best I've had in a long long time the food was fantastic I had a Philly cheese steak a girl add the chicken fried steak we had the amazing mountain of onion rings croissants excellent food great service"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why there are so many harsh reviews on this place. I think the food is phenomenal. And the prices are very reasonable for what you get. The ambience is great, as mentioned. Plenty of open space and seating. I've been here 3 times now, and have not been disappointed any of the times."}
{"text":"Will never go back there again even if I am starving. Went here twice both a few months apart and wasn't pleased what so ever. The first time we went the food was okay and the service sucked. Second time we went the service was okay and the food was absolutely disgusting. We got the f eh and chips and my boyfriend actually threw up in the parking lot on our way out and spent the next two days at home sick along with me. Our server dropped the check off when he dropped our food off and we never saw him again or a manager to complain & it has to be bad for us to complain. Really sad because we wanted to like it."}
{"text":"Two words: Moldy Bread 

That's all I have to say but yelp wants me to write more. FWIW, they were apologetic and comped the meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food!  Best Monte Cristo I have had in a long time. Service was great!  And you can't beat the price."}
{"text":"I first was impressed with the atmosphere. Very relaxing and appeasing, with a brick interior, a giant bubbly fish tank, and a cool oar paddle fan overhead. 

The next thing that impressed me was the variety of dishes, many of which sounded so good that it took me awhile to decide. I was torn between a handful of entrees at the time and decided on a burger.  Compared to other restaurant burgers, it didn't fall apart as I held it, and it was much juicier. I loved it. 

It was so good i went back a few days later to get one of the other entrees I was torn on, and tried the World Class Chicken Sandwich, which very well could be my favorite sandwich ever at this point in my life. I had to take pictures and put it on Facebook. I always have laughed at people who post their food, but now thanks to Cheddars, I'm one of them. 

I thought the coffee was sort of expensive for the little mug of coffee you get, but at least it tasted amazing for someone coming in after a hangover. 

The (alcohol) drink prices were as low as I've seen lately (for the specials).  I moved from Charlotte so I'm used to every thing being kind of pricey, so to see that the menu prices in general where a couple of bucks cheaper than what I'm used to, well, that makes me happy. 

The service was good. I'm not really picky about service, although when I'm ready to go, I'm ready to go and hate waiting on the check. They don't wait forever to check out. Good. 

So yeah, relaxing environment, great tasting food, good service, great prices, and all in all I like this place."}
{"text":"Went here because it was within walking distance of our hotel, we were not disappointed. My husband got the Signature Chicken and Shrimp salad and I got the spagsagna. Yes, spagsagna. It was lasagna but instead of lasagna noodles it had baked pasta. Delicious. I was worried it would be very heavy, but it was surprisingly light and the sauce was flavorful and delicious. Two meals with an appetizer was only $30, an amazing value for the food we received."}
{"text":"This place is always hopping so we decided to give it a try. Nice higher end decor and details, great service, cheap prices, and the server proudly proclaimed that everything is made in-house and from scratch...but the food was just mediocre. You get what you pay for right? I think I'll come back for the drinks. They have quite the drink menu (cheap too) and the Painkiller that kept passing by our table was calling my name!!"}
{"text":"First time here!  Clean attractive place.  
We ordered the tortilla soup, bourbon glazed pork chop (came with mashed potatoes, fried onion rings, mac and cheese), and an appetizer that had chicken tenders, cheese bits, and loaded potato skins.  I finished my pork chop plate and almost licked the mac and cheese dish.  Yup, it was that good.  The appetizer plate was too large to finish so my companion took it home.  I tasted everything and it was delicious, especially the seasoning on chicken tenders. (what is the world did they put in that batter?!)  
Our server was Karissa. She was super attentive, and told us a little about the restaurant since it was our first time here.  At the end, the manager came by and gave us warm chocolate chip cookies.  Amazing.  Everything was delicious and I will be back real soon.  Feel like going back right now and I only left there a few hours ago.  LOL"}
{"text":"Decent prices, large food portion. Don't eat too much! Croissant=best ever!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic be prepared to wait sometimes because it does get busy but it's well worth it. i always get the steak and ribs combo and its real good the meat just falls of the bones and is nice and moist the steak is well seasoned and cooked exactly the way  I want. Portions are good sized and always had good service. Don't listen to the bad reviews, they are just gripers go to this place you won't regret. it"}
{"text":"Cons: slow service, slow food, average food
Pro: cool atmosphere, diverse menu (but again food was just average tasting and nothing special), affordable prices

Our table ordered a hamburger, a wrap, a salmon salad, and a dessert cookie. Nothing was overly good or flavorful. I could make all of these items better at home and I am no expert cook. 

Would not go out of our way to return."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. The waitresses here are treated VERY poorly by the hosts & managers. It seems the hosts pick and choose who to seat in sections based on the servers they like/dislike. I pick up on these things easily because I was a server for a long time. The food... Where do I start. Was RAW & my sides were gotten completely wrong/cold. When I asked for it to be fixed, it came back the exact same. (I have this little trick... I heavily salt the food that comes out wrong. If it comes back salty, I know for a fact they did not properly fix my food.) Which, of course, they didn't. Not to mention the hair that was found... Or the fact my waitress did not refill any of our drinks for 40 minutes. They thought the acceptable way to handle this situation was to only make us pay for our sides and drinks. I did not even argue on the fact that my drinks haven't been refilled the entire time I was seated, or the fact there was hair in my food, but I paid for it anyway. Needless to say I will never come back to this disgusting \"restaurant\" ever again."}
{"text":"Great lunch today. Had the jalapeño cheese burger with a cup of soup. Soup was good burger was outstanding.  Bun fresh and burger was tasteful.  Seasoned to perfection.  My uncle had the chicken finger meal. Chicken was breaded just right. Very lightly seasoned. And the Chocolate cake was truly delicious.  Service was great as well. Cool ambience"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would. I have been going to cheddars like every other week since its been opened and I have never been this disappointed. First off it took forever but we went in close to closing (8:40) so we expected that. Our waiter was TERRIBLE. He forgot my baked potato and straight up told me it sat for too long so we made you another one ( if it was sitting there why was it never brought to me? ) everyone's drinks were empty at the table but the waiters only concern was if I wanted another alcoholic beverage. He complained about another tables check in front of us, & he told us he forgot to put in our to go order that we placed when we ordered our meals.. after speaking with the manager and getting NOTHING accomplished our waited walked over to our table with our receipts and bluntly asked me why I complained. So I told him.. after that he spoke to us VERY condescending.. the fact that the manager told him we complained while we were still there was a WHOLE other level of unprofessionalism. I will NEVER go back to cheddars. Food is great but service was terrible. I will defiantly being calling tomorrow to complain again."}
{"text":"Welcome to the next best thing of Chandler, AZ. I can see folks driving across town on a weekend evening to get away with the family and enjoy some amazing dishes. 

I am from Colorado, where Cheddars Restaurants are prevalent, so I knew what to expect. 

Right now, the restaurant is new so there seem to be a lot of bodies (servers, managers, hosts) but this will change. The service and the overall execution of food delivery will improve over time; I am confident about that. 

Let's get going with the knitty-gritty details of the experience I had. 

To begin, we walked into the restaurant and the decor and space was beautiful. The hostesses at the front were extremely friendly and smiling at our presence. There seemed to be a manager up at the desk who was trying to run the show, and in my opinion, it was a little overbearing and lacking a genuine feel. Kenna (the manager at the desk) was very knowledgable about the restaurant and the history thereof, but proved to be a little domineering and abrasive during our entire visit. I am all about managers circling the restaurant and interacting with guests, but I witnessed her seat a couple at a table and I wasn't impressed with the work ethic. The man was in a wheelchair and his wife had already sat down, and Kenna could have stayed with the guest and attempted to make him feel comfortable; rather, she stood five feet away and observed him attempt to maneuver in between the chairs to get situated (all while attracting a great deal of attention to his table, which I'm sure is not what he wanted). 

The service we personally received was lacking, but this is most likely because of the newness of the servers and the missing experience. Our server was friendly and patient as we decided our entrees and she attempted to make conversation. She took our orders and all seemed well, but after our food arrived, she was no where to be seen until we were ready for the check. We had two other servers attempt to clear our plates and refill our drinks. 

During your restaurant visit, your drink should never be empty, and at one point, I had two empty drinks in front of me and no signs of getting them filled again. 

My burger was phenomenal. I am a \"plain-Dane\" when it comes to food and drink so my burger was supposed to be plain with cheese and cooked as lightly as possible and it was perfect. The chicken tenders were our appetizer and boy do I recommend those. They were awesome! My girlfriend enjoyed a \"wedding cake\" drink and might I say that their drink prices are also amazing. The restaurant I work in charges twice the amount for drinks. If you can dine at a place with heavy portions AND good prices, do it! 

There is one last thing that I would like to comment on. Sometimes at the tables you will find ketchup or salt and pepper or sugar, etc. and regardless of the toppings on the table, they should ALL be full. I had to shake and squeeze the ketchup plenty of times in order to get a pile on my plate. That's a pet peeve of mine, so maybe that's only a complaint I would have. 

PS, the music is hip and appropriate and perfectly loud. The bar is completely separate from the dining room which is also nice. 

All in all, with the right hosts, the right servers, and the right appetite, you will find happiness. 

As always, I share my bill price and the tip I left. 

Our bill was around $37 and I left $50. I have high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"We love Cheddar's!!! My finance and I ran into the place by accident. We had no idea they had a location here in AZ.  He knew of Cheddar's because his parents had lived in Texas.  

We've been to the Chandler location three times since. The food is excellent and the service is great every time. On our most recent visit our server Issac was attentive, helpful and polite. We love the classy atmosphere and have enjoyed each experience here. You can't beat the quality for the prices. 

Today I was happy to discover that they have excellent frozen margaritas. They compare to Macayo's frozen margaritas. They are frozen in a machine rather than blended.  The Texas Frozen margarita will freeze your brain, so beware!  The good news is that there is plenty of tequila in there so you'll warm right up!  That is something about Cheddar's that I've noticed, they don't skimp on the booze.  

After three visits we've had the ribs, chicken strips, sirloin steak, bbq burger and all of it was delicious! My favorite thing so far has been the ribs because the meat is tender and smoky with a smothering of sweet and smoky bbq sauce.  My favorite item menu has to be the chocolate croissant bread pudding. 

We highly recommend Cheddar's!"}
{"text":"The food was really good.  The service was stretched thin, it wasn't bad service, it was just that there wasn't enough servers for a Saturday night.  I do want to return as their menu was really extensive."}
{"text":"I use to say this was a 5 star worthy restaurant but recently (I don't know if chefs change) I have not enjoyed myself. Because of the good prices and everything being from scratch I gave them a few chances. My family still goes but I honestly think the food has gone down hill. The onion rings are still really good. But everything else has has been very bland and not good. I got the potato soup... didn't like it all. One of the sandwiches I originally got there was amazing the last time I got it, it was not the same at all the next time. This was the same with a few different things. Some things are still very good. Please fix this. I don't know what has changed!"}
{"text":"Nowadays a family of even just 3 can't find a decent meal in a casual, comfortable atmosphere for under $50 - or at least that's what we thought until we found Cheddars. Of course we were leery after reviewing the menu online: after all, how good can the food be at those prices? Well we got our answer - GREAT! Huge portions (realistically, too huge) and everything was incredibly fresh and bright. The beer battered fish and chips was amongst the best I've had. It was so light it was almost tempura like, but I could still barely finish about 1 and a 1/2 pieces of the 4 huge pieces of fish on my plate. We easily brought home enough food for another full meal. As for the service, pretty exceptional - knowledgable about the menu and super friendly! We may have just found our new family meal place. Thanks, Cheddars, for recognizing what today's hard working family needs - a cool place to chill and a great meal we can actually afford!"}
{"text":"Very economical choice For family of 4. We ordered 2 children entrees and 2 adult entrees with drinks and our bill was under $55. I enjoyed my BBQ chicken, mash potatoes and broccoli all for $8.99. Food was served in a timely matter and the wait staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Well.. The food at Cheddar's is really good. This is about the 5th time we've dined there. Every time, the food was expertly cooked.

Our server was attentive and polite.

The bathrooms were impeccable.

I docked them a star because:

1: They only had one option for hot sauce, which is Tabasco. I like Tabasco, but for fried options, I prefer Louisiana.. or any other kind for that matter.

2. The table behind us had a couple with a 1 year old that kept screeching. Our entire meal was ruined by a couple of parents that didn't care about the noise their kid was making.

As we ate, I scanned the room, looking at other people's reactions. Each table within sight had at least 2 patrons that were upset by what was going on. 

There was a staff member that was going around asking everyone how their meal was and I heard a couple of people complain, but nothing was done about it. The guy never came by my table to get feedback from us. 

Our server asked if we wanted to order dessert. I told her it was too noisy and I declined a menu. 

It's a Friday night. People are out trying to have a nice meal after a long week. Granted, the ambient noise level at Cheddar's is pretty high, but the noise this child was making was jarring and just plain unnecessary. 

When the staff and management lets things like this happen, it sends a clear message to the patrons. I have been in a couple of restaurants that have successfully put an end to similar situations. Offer them a seat in the patio and a free dessert.

My wife and I have 2 daughters. We know how it is to be parents of young children. One of them was a noisy child. One of us was responsible enough to take my daughter outside until she behaved. If the parents aren't parenting in the restaurant responsibly, then the restaurant should take measures to make sure the rest of the patrons aren't negatively affected by a couple that neglects to keep their child at an acceptable volume.

I like the food at Cheddar's. I will probably return and keep them on a \"short leash\". The first sign of trouble, I will be more proactive and simply walk out, since now I know staff and management will not save my night from parents like the ones I mentioned above.

If the management of Cheddar's is actually reading this, you people need to have a staff meeting about what to do in these situations. This incident happened between 6:50-7:30 on Friday, September 22, 2017. The table in question was located right behind the host station, right in front, and in heard the screeching as I was giving my name to the host, and we looked at each other and acknowledged the noise this child was made, so I know he was aware of the problem. He was just as annoyed as I was."}
{"text":"Based only on their ribs!

LOVE their ribs.  Best I've had and price is just as good!  The only two sides I've enjoyed are the mac and cheese and the black beans.

Other than ribs, food is mediocre"}
{"text":"I like to think of reviewing restaurants as being a bit like grading Olympic divers. Bear with me on this one. There are two scales: \"How difficult was the dive\" and \"How well did they execute?\" 
Cheddar's doesn't have lofty aspirations. It's casual dining; my wife and I were looking for somewhere to go with our 1-year-olds, so \"kid friendly\" was a must. Found it on Yelp, and it was perfect.
Decor is, as someone mentioned, kind of in the Applebees/Chilis zone, with less random stuff bolted to the wall than, say, Friday's.
Service was the high point of a good experience. We were seated quickly by a host, and our server was  perfectly attentive - appearing when we needed her, disappearing when we didn't, and navigating effortlessly among two adults and two toddlers.
The food was good. It wasn't fine-dining-wow-this-was-amazing good, but it was tasty. The Texas Cheese Fries were appropriately ridiculously huge; the kids' meals came (appreciatedly!) with veggies instead of fries. The kids liked their meals; we liked ours. Solid B+ on the food. 
The prices were insanely good. Like \"Wait, did I read that right?\" good. 
This would be a great place to go out as a family. I would guess, later in the evening, it wouldn't be a bad place for some broke college kids to scarf down a ton of food. Probably not a good place for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Was there on a sunday about 5pm. I truly enjoyed everything about this restaurant.  The host, the manager and the waitress,Olivia. Everyone was welcoming and friendly. The seating and ambiance  was comfortable. The salmon and strawberry salad was one of the best I have had. It was loaded with strawberries,  caramelized pecans and asiago cheese, truly delicious, perfect for the summer . I will return."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were really excited to try this restaurant but we left feeling really let down. Our waitress was Cassie and she was fantastic and is the reason this review is getting 3 stars. However, the food was disappointing. I had the New Orleans Pasta which had decent flavor but the pasta was way too over cooked. Nothing is worse than mushy pasta. My fiancé had the chicken tenders with fries and mac n cheese and overall, not impressed. Sadly, we won't be giving this restaurant a second shot."}
{"text":"We stopped by here in a fluke.  I was driving by and said lets eat here for dinner.  The wait was probably around 20 minutes.  I ordered the chicken fried steak and will say it was probably the best one I have ever had.  I have traveled all over the country and eaten CFS in different places.  Cheddars was super great.  The CFS was fresh and the sides that came with it were good too.  I will definitely stop by here again for dinner soon.  I like it and will get the CFS again."}
{"text":"We tried this place as it is new to Chandler, and we love to try new places. Honestly after reading some of the other reviews I was worried about poor service. However or server Heather (I think that was her name...pregnancy brain disrupts my memory) was great! She kept or glasses full and the food came in a timely manner. Our appetizer chips and queso was delicious, and the mango tea even better!! I had the lunch combo half sandwich/wrap abd two sides. I went with the buffalo chicken wrap. The flavor was there, hoping for a tad more buffalo sauce, abd the bedding in the chicken was somewhat soggy and falling off but over all the flavor was good. For sides I tried the tortilla soup not the best I've had. The loaded baked potato side was most definitely loaded. It was my favorite part of the dish. My husband had the chicken tenders and steak other than the soggy onion strings his meal was delish! Over all good experience."}
{"text":"Cheddar is better but not here. 
I was invited to join in on a birthday celebration dinner so I went. I checked out the menu before hand just to see the options I had.  Nothing wet my whistle but to be polite I went.

Just as I expected,  lousy tasteless bland American food. But, wait, the place was packed and hungry people waiting to get in. I'm puzzled ?

The service we had was as bad as the food I ordered.
Our salads were to be served before our meal and it didn't happen.  But our server had a good excuse she said \" boy are we busy\"

My beer battered fish and chips were luke warm and the fries were cold and dry. I only choose that menu item because nothing else appealed to me.

I could go on and on but I don't want to waste my time just like the people that prepared my food.

Cheddar needs to get better, but not for me..yuck !"}
{"text":"I must say when this Cheddar's opened they were the best.  I am not sure what happened along the way.  With the different staff and maybe cooks.  I was there this past Sunday and it was just awful.  I do not want to give it a star.  I received the corn as a side and it was so salty I could not get passed two bites.  Then I ordered the ribs and chicken fingers. They placed the chicken fingers right in the juice of the corn so now the fingers are way to salty to eat and soggy.  I had to ask for another plate and they looked at me like I was the crazy one.  Well I see they have been bought by Darden so I am hoping they clean up the place.  The rest rooms were nasty, the floors, and the table.  That place has just gone down hill.  They need a cleaning crew to just clean up the place.  So disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is always good, the service is usually always good and the inside is super cute! My girlfriend and I go here all the time for date night and everyone we have told about this place LOVES it! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Great food, fair prices, nice waiter but slow as h_ll. oMg, it took 2 hours for a 1 hour meal. The poor guy had 5 tables and he was moving like a turtle."}
{"text":"I've had better chicken from a drive through. Charred, dry, stringy and completely tasteless. Looks like it was cooked hours before they served it to me. Unfortunately I carried out so no opportunity to have them fix it. 
I know it's a chain, so I wasn't expecting anything exceptional, but I ended up cooking my own dinner instead of eating this $10 chew toy. Do not waste your time."}
{"text":"Had late lunch there on Saturday. The service from our waiter was top notch! The chicken tenders and shrimp were both good, as well as my friend's grilled fish. Although, both dishes were only lukewarm when they came out . :(
The Texas tea wasn't strong but it was good. Can't understand the drink limit on that one.  I've heard great things about this restaurant from my family back in Wisconsin so, I'll give it another try someday soon."}
{"text":"I had a  grilled chicken  walnut salad which was very good. My wife had the fried chicken salad which was not as fresh as the chicken was soggy. 

The place is nice but the service was slow and we were not impressed by cleanness. Happen to go to use the bathroom and passed by the open kitchen area. There was stuff all over the floor."}
{"text":"This is my definition of comfort food in comfortable surroundings. Every time I have been here I have had excellent service. There can be a bit of a wait but it is so worth it."}
{"text":"Everything is Awesome from service to food every time we have been there 6 times or more . Different servers different menu items . Prices are great 5 star experience all the way Issac T and the staff Rocks"}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped here for a late dinner. We started with an order of their honey buttered smack yo momma croissants! Yep. Pure deliciousness. 

For dinner I ordered the salmon with the bourbon glaze, corn and broccoli and cheese casserole. I really enjoyed the bourbon glaze! The corn and casserole were classic but delicious.The service was great and you can't beat the prices!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times, always generally pretty good.  Love the side salad and croissant!  Used to eat at a lot various locations in Texas!  Went tonight had Ciara as out server, she's excellent!  Food is always above average!  The Mac&Cheese tonight was really bad tonight, hence the star deduction!  Ciara gladly replaced it for me with broccoli cheese casserole which was greatly appreciated!  Onion Rings, Ribs, Queso dip, and exotic drinks are always top notch when dining here!  True comfort food at decent prices!  I'll continue to be a regular!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews before going and saw that many people recently have had trouble with their service. 
We went anyway. The food was good but it took a long time and they forgot several of the items that were ordered. Refills were almost non existent. 
We have gone many times in the past without the issues that happened this time. 
Seems to be a management issue. 
Their food is good.....just be very very patient and understanding."}
{"text":"As with other restaurants in this casual category,(Or ANY Restaurants for that matter) It can be \"Hit or Miss\".
In MY humble opinion , The true measure of a restaurant's quality, is in \"How they handle the Misses\" ! 
That said, I personally have been yet to experience a \"Miss\" here."}
{"text":"We have been there a few times.  The first one or two times I thought were great prices and nice people. That said, as we continued to go there thee service got slow, the people no longer friendly and though the prices are reasonable I would never go back again."}
{"text":"I went here with the GF and all was pretty good except a nasty storm outside.

I ordered a steak and they brought out the wrong one. I was already half way through it and they came and delivered the correct size and let me keep the original.

The GF ordered a salad with no meat (vegetarian) and it came with meat.

The head cook/chef actually came over to the table and personally apologized for the steak mixup and salad snafu. This won big points with me as he seemed very genuine. And besides, we weren't too upset to begin with.

I'd go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Had lunch at restaurant for the first time this past weekend with a group of friends and the food was ok. There was a annoying fly that kept going around our table and at times would land on our straws and it even went into my wife's margarita. The waitress was kind enough to replace the margarita. I ordered a chicken buffalo wrap and I was just not impressed with the flavor, was not spicy at all. I'll have to give it another try next time I'm around the area and try something different on their menu. For now, I'll have to give it a 2 star rating."}
{"text":"First timer. My wife ordered the chicken fried steak and was suitably impressed. My son order the glazed pork chop and liked it as well. I had a bite of each and agreed, thumbs up. Onion rings, best ever.

For myself, I ordered steak. There are four offerings: a sirloin and a ribeye. I ordered the 6 oz sirloin cause I thought that was enough for me, $9.99 with two sides. Now the grilling gave it a nice flavor, but it was like chewing an old rope. I have not worked harder to eat something this half-year; I have a boot I think I could eat quicker. Again, good flavor, just not very edible. I fault myself for being attracted by the price; I should know better. My advice to you, if you order steak here; spend a little more, take the ribeye; avoid the sirloin."}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer to this restaurant, I'd likely come 3-4 times per month. Based on a single lunch-time visit: the food was very good and prices better - this makes for great value!

Their menu is large and invites exploring - I think I'd order almost half of the items listed. Well done!"}
{"text":"We have dined at Cheddars a handful of times and we have not had great food or service.  However we decided to give it another go since it had been a few months.

This time we did have some issues and the service was slow HOWEVER, the manager ERIN and I spoke about the bathroom being unattended, the food issues, a soup brought without a spoon, and a few other issues.

ERIN the manager was almost distraught for us she felt so bad that she comped our entire meal AND gave us some coupons.  I have never had such impeccable manager interception and care.  We WILL go again if only for ERIN.  She even gave us her card to call in advance so she could supervise our event.  Thank you ERIN!"}
{"text":"Really great food and service.  Location is nice with lots of parking.  What more can I say?  I like it!"}
{"text":"went here last night with some friends. only reason i'm giving 4 stars is because of the food. the waitress we first had was RUDE! she took forever to accompany us and she barely had any tables! people that came in after us got their food and DRINKS before us! another waitress came up to us and explained to that she was going to help us out since the first one had gone home for the day. we were wondering why she wasn't doing her job! terrible service! the second waitress helped out a lot and received a generous tip from all of us!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. The prices are great. Alcohol is EXPENSIVE... They give lots of food for the price. My one mix drunk cost more than my meal."}
{"text":"My usual keywest chicken and shrimp. I always order without the pico and of course she brings it to me anyway and as I tell her it's incorrect she continues to hand me my plate and says well I told them no pico. My whole family's order was here so I just picked around it but I wasn't happy"}
{"text":"Perhaps Friday night was not the night to go? 

The place was packed so my girlfriends and I decided to have a drink at the bar while we waited. I ordered a margarita...and it was pretty yummy.  And for a very reasonable price! The bartenders were all very nice and hilarious...they seem like they know how to have a good time. 

But that's pretty much where our good times ended. After we were seated and given our menus our very unenthusiastic waitress arrived and asked if we were ready to order?!? We. Just. Sat. Down....so Ummm...no...not yet can we have a few moments? 

Literally, after TWO minutes she was back...still not enough time to review the menu which has a pretty good variety and again very reasonable prices. So we asked for a few more moments, and she seemed annoyed but obliged. Now, don't get me wrong I'm all about attentive service...if it had been that I wouldn't mind but I hate feeling rushed! Especially after I just waited 30 minutes for a table! 

When she returned we were ready, I ordered the tilapia with mango salsa with comes topped so shrimp over rice with the choice of two sides. I asked for the mango salsa on the side, and ordered the broccoli and cheese casserole and buttered corn. 

After we ordered we waited and waited. Our waitress didn't make another appearance so we were left with empty glasses, no napkins or silverware. However, another server finally brought out our food...still NO silverware or napkins....so we asked if she could bring them....nothing....so we waited some more. Then when we finally found our waitress we asked again, she said she would, be right back with the silverware and again we WAITED. Finally, we tracked out another waiter and finally got our silverware and napkins...UGH! 

The sad part is that the food was actually really good. My fish was seasoned so well and it shrimp on top were the perfect compliment. the mango salsa was really good too...but I'm glad I got it on the side. But since the service was lacking and it was a complete madhouse in our section I just can't really say I'm a total fan of this place. 

So for now, everything was just okay. Honestly, based on experience alone they deserve 2 stars but the food bumped them up to a 3 star. I guess I will give them another chance on a different night, with a different server and HOPE that it's a better experience."}
{"text":"Zero stars!!! The wait staff dropped ranch sauce all over my black boots from the sole to the knee. Two customers who were sitting around us who saw my boots helped me to clean up my boots as the staff watched on. My friend asked for wet washcloths as her feet were also smothered in ranch sauce, she was wearing sandals. It took three times to get the washcloths and they only brought one. While we were cleaning up the mess the staff stood there with our food in their hands. 15 minutes after our food came we were presented with the check for the full amount. We were not comped for our meal or given anything free. The manager did come to us a while later too file paperwork for my boots to be cleaned and no one called me.  I did call the restaurant back about it and the manager said corporate would be calling me. No one ever called and I got the run around. Needless to say ranch sauce has oil in it and my leather boots were ruined because I couldnt get them cleaned immediately. My fault for believing in a company."}
{"text":"I normally eat here every Friday for lunch. However  on 2/23 I ordered my food and arrived at Cheddars 30 mins later for my food not to be ready. I was trying my hardest to be patient because I absolutely love this place. However I waited 30 more minutes and then the credit card machine was not working so I could not pay for my food. Went back today ordered my food at 12:50 arrived at 1:15, food not ready waited until 1:40 food still wasn't ready not to say I had to leave and go back to work....hungry, frustrated and disappointed!!! I will more than likely try it again simply because I love the salmon and it is so close to my job. I will definitely call and make sure my food is ready for pick up before leaving work."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time there and it'll be the last. The waitress never wrote down our orders even after I asked her if she would remember it. She bragged about how she never gets anything wrong. Well, 15 minutes later and everybody's order was wrong. The food wasn't that great and when the waitress realized that our food was wrong we never saw her again. Don't waste your time or money here"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of chain restaurants but I love this place.  The decor is great and whether you are sitting in the bar, outside, or the regular dining area - i've always felt comfortable. The big fans they have on the ceiling are pretty cool

The service is hit or miss. I've had great service but more often than not it's lacking.

The homemade queso is EXCELLENT but my favorite is the loaded baked potato soup...I'm a big potato soup lover and their soup always hits the spot. 

The burgers are big and juicy and always cooked right. The fries are good too.

This was my go to restaurant when I wanted a cheap good meal...great for college students!!!!"}
{"text":"I am currently done at your restaurant on  university. Center blvd. our server seems to be unhappy to wait on us. He seemed annoyed with all questions asked. When we came in we asked for a gluten free menu (my father is allergic to wheat) however your manger did come over and somewhat assist w ordering.  By saying order everything w out seasoning.  Then our server came back about 15min later to take our drink order and meal order at the same time. Then I asked a few min later if I could change my sides to a salad at which point the server rolled his eyes and huffed the said ok. Then our food came out 15min later at which point he asked what dressing I wanted. I said I didn't need the salad that what I had was fine.  My father ordered a ribeye which was cut wrong,, he had an awful time trying to cut it and eat it.  Our drinks were never refilled.  It has been a very unpleasant meal.  We have dined at many restaurants and this was one of the worst serving experiences.  I also didn't realize that croissant don't come with your meal."}
{"text":"Went on grand opening day and day after again. Great food and really great drinks!! Very reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Absolute upscale atmosphere with incredibly reasonable prices. The food is all made from scratch in the back and the the attention to flavor is front and center. If you are lucky enough to be taken care of by Marshall your experience just enhanced 10 fold. Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"We had an Awesome waitress Cindy and the potato skins were good, then we waited an hour for cold meals and my plate had 2 raw shrimp!!! The general manager was there and didnt even come out to the table!!! Not to mention we had a 1yr old that was hungry and now we are going to McDonald's!!! what a joke of a restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, good price and really good service. Had cheese sticks which were excellent. Tea was above average. Booths are large and you have plenty of room to spread out. I ordered Spasagna w/meat sauce. Loved it. Good flavors with plenty of sauce and cheese. Wife ordered Chicken tenders, which she loves. She also got coleslaw and green beans. I tried the slaw. Pretty good. Service was fast and the food was hot. Waitress was attentive and had an excellent personality. Only problem would be that the wait staff did not know ingredients of some of the menu items. Our waitress did not know if coleslaw had onions in it. Also overheard another waitress, at another table tell her customers she would have to check on contents of menu items. Staff should know all about the food. Training, training, tasting...."}
{"text":"Drink was good, skinny Marg! o'rings app was OK, then the service and wait began for the dinner... 40 minutes later food comes and most of it was cold, the manager was sent over and he could care less that it was cold, offered to take off the app, and walked away. seemed that it was like that in several table in the bar area where we were sitting, many complaints of cold food and the manager looked irritated he had to keep coming out to deal with unhappy people"}
{"text":"Terrible , Terrible Service. A friend and I walked in during lunch to enjoy a quick good lunch with a drink. Only having an hour lunch break it took them 15 minutes to come and get our drink orders. While the lady was there we decided to go ahead and order since we had to be quick. Of course we ordered a drink while there. Lets just say...our food came out before the drinks. So...no water, no tea, nor alcoholic beverage was brought to our table before our food. The restaurant was not busy at all, so we were confused on why we were waiting so long. We finally got our water and tea, while waiting on the alcohol to come. So mid way during our lunch we decided to cancel the drink order and she was like it was already made and expected us to pay for it. We politely declined and finished our meal, paid for our food and left. Not pleased at all today"}
{"text":"This was my first time to a Cheddar's. A co-worker of mine asked me to come along to lunch and I didn't think anything of it. I was completely blown away once we got there and I looked at the menu. The food was dirt cheap but I literally couldn't decide what to eat because nothing looked good. We got the Santa Fe dip appetizer which was essentially watery spinach dip. I was starving and it didn't even taste good. I finally decided to get buffalo chicken tenders for lunch. The tenders were terrible which is hard to do. The salad was basically iceberg lettuce salad mix from a bag. The prices are really low but the quality is just as low. I couldn't be paid to go back! Excellent service though!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but no kids menu and crayons at a \"family friendly\" restaurant? That's like a sushi restaurant not having chop sticks!"}
{"text":"We come here at least once/twice quarterly. Can't beat the prices for an entree with two sides. It can get really busy and loud sometimes, especially on Fri &Sat evenings/ Sunday afternoons.  I will say the service leaves a lot to be desired. No one has yet to be horrible, but we have had our share of very clumsy/forgetful/ unattentive. We have also noticed that the spinach dip does not taste the same as before like they skimped on the cheese/something. It has a strange aftertaste. The flavored teas are always nice and honey croissants are addictive.  To sum it up, if you want a decent meal for under $12 pp ( including drink) , then this is your place."}
{"text":"This place has the best veggie burger i've had in Charlotte. Now granted, I haven't been to luna's yet but until I do, Cheddars has my vote. It's flippin huge! Made in store, not a frozen pattie. The 1st time I had it i had the waitress to double check because I thought it was a beef burger. I'd never seen a veggie burger that size. I ordered the mushroom swiss burger and substituted for veg pattie. Anyway, first bite, I'm in love!"}
{"text":"First time at this chain, overall i was impressed and would go back.

For food i ordered the Monte Cristo, my wive ordered the Alfredo pasta. Others at the table ordered chicken tenders, ribs and Mac n cheese. Have to say everything was very good, gotta love the Monte Cristo definitely not healthy but awesome. (basically a better version of it than Bennigans if you have ever been to one of those). The only downfall was the Alfredo was very bland, the server offered something else but since their portions are pretty large we just said it was ok and shared the other items. 

Was super busy since its new so hopefully it gets better as far as service.  Inside feels upscale and decor is on the contemporary side. Prices are average.

I see this sticking around awhile unlike the other places this building has been over the years."}
{"text":"Decent food for a decent price. I tried the fish tacos and the honey croissants. Pretty good. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Great food, massive portions, and hit or miss service.  Definitely come when it isn't busy and ordering the chicken strips is always safe.  Try them buffalo style!"}
{"text":"I thought it was good! I ordered a salad, which it came with bread, soup which was yummy, and then a Monte C for the sake of it. Service was fast for lunch. Clean. I would definitely be back."}
{"text":"Way too noisy.  Have been here twice recently with friends, both times at off-hours but was still pretty busy.  Food was good, especially grilled salmon, Philly cheesesteak, chicken tenders, and fries.  Sides of  cole slaw and apple/yogurt were so-so.  Service was friendly and helpful and reasonably prompt given how busy it was.  Décor is quite nice, and food presentation was excellent.  I'd have given it four or five stars if other customers weren't so noisy it was hard to hear each other across the table. The management might consider better sound- absorbing floor coverings and wall hangings."}
{"text":"From the outside and steeping right in, I felt as if the place was going to be a little more on the high-end (as far as quality and pricing), however when I started going over the menu, I noticed it was decently if not, cheaply priced, which I guess is why I feel a little guilty about not raising it up to 4 stars? But I'll explain why. We ordered chicken tenders, fries, house salad and fish n' chips.

 I was leaning towards trying a burger, but I wanted to see how he deep fry skills were here. In which I was sadly disappointed, the skin was not as crispy as I imagined, and very bland. The fish inside was just weird, I feel like it was the wrong type of fish to deep fry? Oh if I could only remember if it was cod on the menu but my memory fails me. All I can say is that it was the quality was not memorable at all. There wasn't even lemons or coleslaw on the side, no fries either. The chicken strips were just ok and the house salad was your run of the mill, feels like iceberg salad from a bag mix. 

This place remind me of big chain restaurants like Chili's and Applebee's, and there's nothing wrong with those places, they're just mediocre in the quality of food and expectations, and this place falls along those lines. Sorry, wish I was more impressed but I'm just not."}
{"text":"Well me and my husband ate here today for lunch, I had the lunch pick two Items so I got the Spinach and Strawberry salad, that was really good, then I got a fully loaded baked potato, I'm not sure when they said fully loaded it game with a little butter on it and cheddar sprinkled on it and a dab of sour cream, It was so underwheling I asked for more sour cream then they charged me an extra 30 cents ??  Then my husband got the pick two lunch and he got the house salad which is really good, and the  1/2 club sandwich, he only ate half of that, the bread was toasted but so hard."}
{"text":"Have been here multiple times. They always have good food. I my go to's are fish tacos, fish and chips, offer there ribs."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Cheddar's, but this night was not so great.  I went with a group of friends, who was just hungry.  So, we decided to stop in at Cheddar's because we usually have good service.

So, the first thing:  Bad service.  The wait staff there was very rushed and didn't care for our issues.  My friend found a rubber piece in her food and only deducted 10% off the item.  What the heck?

Second, my gravy on chicken steak and gravy was burnt.  Who burns gravy?  I told the waitress, who told her manager and the manager wasn't even shocked.  She told me she would take it off the bill, which she did, but still charged me $4 for the side of Mac & Cheese I ate.

I'm no longer a fan."}
{"text":"I ordered the 8 oz steak, loaded baked potato, and broccoli cheese casserole and let me tell you.. it was the BEST dinner I've had in a long time. Delicious food, a wonderful server, and a nice atmosphere! I definitely see this place becoming a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"We had never been to this particular location, but have always enjoyed eating here. The food at this location was really good, although the service was less than good. It was a busy night and our server seemed to be very distracted. Management was overheard telling servers to get on the food, because it was backing up in the kitchen."}
{"text":"This place is great!! The food, the service and the management. Everything was great....the manager Mike Norris on top of things. The staff looked very professional and the atmosphere was very pleasant. Also, the menu was something for everyone."}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite restaurant! All of the staff are kind and extremely responsive. On top of that, the food is amazing! I've tried several sandwiches, wraps, and appetizers and they were all delicious. Everything was definitely fresh and the prices were on point. They always seem to be busy but the wait times are minimal."}
{"text":"This afternoon my family and I came to Cheddar's. The food was excellent, everything was flavorful and delicious. Some of the food is made from scratch, so there's a bit of a wait, but it's well worth it. Our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu and very attentive.  She actually waited before coming back and asking how our food was.  At most other places, servers come back right after they bring you the food, and you don't even have two bites in, so I appreciated her waiting for us to get a chance to taste it.  
The ambiance of the restaurant is really nice. Visable location from the street. Inside, the furniture is dark but the lighting makes up for it.  Where we sat, near the patio, we got a lot of natural lighting as well.
Our waitress only did one thing wrong, which was giving my aunt the bill instead of my Nana, like she had asked (it was my aunt's birthday and Nana wanted to pay w/o my aunt seeing the amount).  But other than that, everything was perfect."}
{"text":"I have not been to a Cheddar's for a few years, I forgot how good it is. My Dijon Chicken meal was outstanding, and I love that you can get nice healthy vegetables as your sides. They have a pretty extensive menu here as well, lots of choices that should appeal to almost everyone."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome for a chain:)
Had dinner here with my parents, and it was great. 

Our server was extremely helpful and attentive!  She was at our table within minutes of being seated and was quick to gwt our drinks and put in our appatizer order of spinach dip (yummy ).

The dip was quick to the table and orders taken.

Food arrived shortly after the app was done...

Chicken fried chicken;  A+ super yummy with awesome mashed potatoes and green beans. 

Steak and vegetables;  A for the cook of the steak and B+ for flavor. 

BBQ chicken and fries; chicken..meh...fries, yummy.

Ordered peach dessert;  super sweet and delicious :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place several times and have also ordered food to go and have always been more than satisfied. The food is really good and the service is prompt. It has a nice ambience and a little of every back ground seem to frequent the place. This can be an enjoyable experience as a family, for a date, or to hang out with friends. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The costumer service here is fantastic! Since it was our first time here, they gave us fresh warm cookies when we got the bill. The manager came and thanked us for coming in, told us about an online survey that gives us a free appetizer and weekly deals. The server and manager went out of their way to accommodate us. 
I got the vegetable plate which was soup or salad and four sides for $7.99. I thought that was a great value. Everything I ordered was great. The side salad was better than the norm. He got the steak with sides and said the steak was good quality and very good. 
Atmosphere is dark inside and cozy feeling. Very relaxing. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"They took away my chicken and waffles! As if that's not enough to tank the whole review, just the entire experience was terrible. The service was entirely too slow. Our waitress had 3 tables full, and we saw her maybe 4 times, including the time she brought us our check. I had ordered the nachos and waited for a while, when they finally got to the table I had time to bite into one and comment that it was cold, and then our food showed up! Isn't it an appetizer for a reason? Listen, Cheddar's has always been good to me, but this time... This time not so much."}
{"text":"Our first visit was today - a nice looking restaurant with good service.

The reason for three stars is, three of us ordered the Philly Cheese-Steak and all three were unhappy.  I honestly haven't ever seen cheese-steak prepared as this (was) with diced mushrooms, onions, and peppers with see through paper thin \"snips\" of beef.  Skip it, the coleslaw, and black beans.

On the other hand, two ordered the ribs and I assure you not even a sliver of meat remained!  Baked potato, french fries, and broccoli cheddar casserole - all very good.

Word to the wise...\"fan out\" when ordering to improve your chances of success."}
{"text":"This place is good. I've had a lot of different things on their menu and all came out great. Prices are beyond fair as well. The people that complain are people you can never please."}
{"text":"My review of 4 stars is based on just the food being a little salty but overall fantastic comfort food and great atmosphere. It also helped that our server,  Matt, was one of the best we've had in awhile. 

When first walking in, they have a classy brick look and huge fish aquarium.... Honestly didn't expect it so nice inside for the prices (nicer than an Outback's or Applebee's).

The Wisconsin Cheese Bites was our appetizer and they were delicious!  Even though these are salty, that's how cheese curds should be and the batter on them were fantastic.  

My wife got the New Orleans Alfredo pasta dish which had great flavor and a mixture of shrimp, dark meat chicken (in case you only like white meat) and sausage.  Had peppers and carmalized onions which really made the dish.   I got the crispy fish and shrimp.   My fault for getting fried appetizer and entree but the plate was good.  The white fish (catfish) was not as seasoned as the shrimp but still very light (perfect for the batter).  The coleslaw was actually really good which makes sense since the ribs are popular here. 

Before I get to the dessert ...  I have to reiterate that our server Matt was awesome.  You can tell he's a fan of his job and the food which is always encouraging.   He helped us decide on entrees and the number one thing is he had refills brought out every time we were almost done with our current one.   Top notch service there! 

The dessert we got was their Monster cookie Sundae.  Pazookie as we like to call it.   Best one we've ever had...  The cookie makes or breaks these and it was a HUGE fluffy chocolate chip cookie that was amazing! Highly recommended! 

Overall...  For the price,  we will definitely be back to try their potpie and bbq ribs.   Give it a shot if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars. The service was dreadful!! The waiter was extremely rude and acted like we were a burden. I love Cheddars, but I will never come back to this location EVER again!!"}
{"text":"Cheddars is never a bad move for lunch or dinner! They have a really big menu so it's almost impossible to go in and not find something on the menu that you're looking for. 

The entire menu is made from scratch and it's easy to tell. Super fresh and tasty food. All of the sides are my personal favorite. They have an option on the menu where you whole meal can just be a bunch of sides... amazing.

I would personally recommend any of the potatoes, the Mac and cheese, the corn, or the broccoli cheddar casserole (so so so good)!"}
{"text":"We have been at Cheddars many times and it is one of our favorite places ! Enjoyed a very good dinner with my husband and son ."}
{"text":"This restaurant goes into my list of scary restaurants.   The waitress was friendly and the food came out in a timely manner.   I ordered a Cheddar Club sandwich.  In seeing that the turkey was processed, I removed most of the turkey and ate one of the four sections.  When I started to take of the turkey in the next section I noticed something strange in it.  Every slice of cheese still had the paper on it.  In looking at all three sections left, every piece of cheese had the paper on it.  Yikes, I already ate one section.  

We found a manager and explained the issue. He whisked my plate up and said he would take it off the bill and ask if I wanted something else.  Before I could answer, he was gone.  No apology and certainly no concern for me.  It felt like an expected problem.   The waitress came buy and flung the bill on the table and was suddenly very rude. Something was really weird at that point.  

I emailed the company the next day.  They never responded.  Makes me wonder what else they are hiding from."}
{"text":"couldn't even get a server to come take a drink order,  left after 12-15 minutes

yelp wants me to say more ... so, ...i'll never go back, ...you should seriously weigh your patience before trying this place ... they need either more or better wait staff ...

they do have a parking lot ...

the other guests also walking out were nice"}
{"text":"Last time I brought my mom from out of town here, we lived it & had no issues. Today, we came for dinner & the service was TERRIBLE! When we got here, there was no wait & about 10 waiters standing by the hostess stand. They sat there for about 5 mins debating on where to put us. We asked for a booster seat & NEVER got one. Then when we asked about the dinner specials the waitress told us she didn't know what they were. So we asked her to go look then she told us half of the specials. My mom ordered a salad for a starter & we didn't have silverware for 10 mins. We asked another waitress if she could grab some since our waitress didn't come out yet & she told us they were wrapping them in the back & didn't have any although we already had our salad. Finally our waitress brought some & said they had some available. When we got the food, it was great but it was like warm so I had to have her warm it up. Overall, the food was good but do to the service, who knows if we will be back."}
{"text":"This is not what we typically like to eat.
Cheddars is billed as a made from scratch kitchen.
But that means they make hamburger and fries from scratch.

If you like typical American food, the kind you find at pubs or diners, you will like it here.
Not real greasy or over/under seasoned.

But not what I look for when eating out."}
{"text":"Was really impressed when I walked through the doors. I was memorized by the cool ceiling fan over the main seating area and the cool fish tank in the wall between dining room and bar area. We were told to choose our own booth in bar area and were immediately greeted by the waitress. we ordered a couple of specialty margaritas, took a bit longer than would have liked but they were good. I got the Beer Battered Fish Tacos, served on tortilla with corn roasted slaw and a Cajun tartar sauce. Never had fish taco deep fried before, but this was incredibly good. French fries were hand cut, fresh and nicely seasoned. The Beer battered shrimp were lightly battered but a good bold taste to it. But the hit of the table was the Sweet Heat Chicken and Shrimp. A fantastic sweet chilli sauce glaze. 
The bar side has a TV over the bar and a couple others in the corners that had different games on."}
{"text":"1st time here and food was very good, surprisingly inexpensive, and the restaurant itself had a great look to it. Great variety, fast service, will def be back!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place. Really good food, the service is great, and surprising for how busy they get. There was a 30 minute wait to be seated inside but immediate seating on the patio. Sure, the view is that of a parking lot, but really you can't beat the weather and it was significantly quieter than inside. I will be continuing my visits here and recommend them. 

Food wise- the pot pie is really good, citrus glazed salmon is great, the buffalo chicken wrap was good (huge tho, its like getting 2 burritos) and (fun fact) everything is from scratch. 

Enjoy"}
{"text":"We went there as a group of 15 for a work function. At first we had to wait for them to gather tables because the location does not accommodate large groups. After being seated we were greeted by our one server, after an inquiry we were awarded another server. Server attentive and refills when needed. Food came out, I had no complaint and I actually took a potion home and ate for dinner later. I will try this place again with a smaller party and update review based on that."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place isn't 5+ best burgers and service! I have been there about five times no complaints just dreams about there burgers!"}
{"text":"What is WRONG with people?  We've seen this restaurant packed out since it opened a few months ago.  We're not much of \"chain\" diners, but we decided to give it shot thanks to the overwhelming community support it was getting.  HUGE MISTAKE!  That was the nastiest meal I've ever eaten at a restaurant, bar none!  The steak was overcooked and the consistency of mule hide.  And when you have to mask the cheap cut of steak with some of that even cheaper spice rub you buy in a grocery store you know something's wrong.  Every single one of my sides, from the mashed potatoes with gravy to the broccoli casserole (and the potato soup) had a layer of skin so thick I practically had to use the steak knife to cut it.  Since I thought my husband was enjoying his meal of New Orleans pasta I decided to keep my mouth shut, until he got into the car and said \"Seriously, who puts BREAKFAST sausage in New Orleans pasta?\"  His meal was as bad as mine!  What was supposed to be a great birthday meal for two kids and two adults cost fifty bucks; we feel like we're owed $45 back.  They gained and lost our patronage in the very same day.  I honestly hope the masses that keep this place going have completely lost their sense of smell and taste buds; otherwise I'm going to start seeing that particular restaurant as the entrance to The Twilight Zone!  Eating there just defies logic!"}
{"text":"So far I can always count on this location for a great meal and great service!!! Fortunately I've never had a long wait at this location and they are quick with bring the food!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty average experience. I came here with my family on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. Due to our somewhat large party, we sat outside on the patio. With the restaurant being short staffed at the moment we only had one waiter. (They had \"we are hiring\"signs around the restaurant) He was kind and worked well but made a few mistakes with our orders and wasn't around as much as he should've been to offer refills or to see if we were all good. My food overall was okay...I got the grilled buffalo chicken wrap and it wasn't that great. The chicken inside was in big chunks and the cheese wasn't melted at all which made it unpleasant to eat. One thing that stood out to me was that the staff would take their breaks on the patio as well which made it awkward to eat while the kitchen staff or servers were sitting around us and decompressing. 

One factor that was good about the restaurant were the prices. Pretty affordable menu with a variety of appealing options. 

Overall pretty average experience but might be willing to give it another shot."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but the service is always terrible. My fiancé ordered a sandwich with no mayo and it came with mayo. I ordered mashed potatoes with gravy... anddddd no gravy. Not really sure what the deal is, but they need new servers and hosts as well. We have walked in before and the host/servers have stood there talking with each other instead of attending to guests. :( Hopefully they can get a new staff soon! Atmosphere is nice and relaxing."}
{"text":"Just had the most horrible experience! I try to remind myself that it's...just...Cheddars...but this was unacceptable! Food was overcooked, bartender was super slow, servers were congregating near our table watching the BET Awards!?!?! Manager poured our beer and it was full of foam, they let it sit until the foam went down then poured it into a smaller glass. It was disgusting! Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. They should be ashamed!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. Came to try the salmon lunch and have a drink after work. Was seated but a lovely host and everything started great. About 10 mins of just sitting there no waiter had even stop by the table to check on us. About another 7 mins passes and finally a waiter came and ask if we had been help and we said no then he took or drink order and food order. We ordered the Maui Margarita. Which was a blended drink with mango and strawberry puree with a kiwi sauce on top and a green shot on the side. The waiter came back 20 mind later with no drink stating the bar ran out of strawberry puree. So we informed him that we want the same drink just without the strawberry. Waiter came back about 12 mins later with a completely different drink. There was no shot on the side no green kiwi sauce on top it was just a complete different drink then what we ordered. I tried to explain that we wanted the same drink just with out the strawberry puree and he keep telling us they don't have the drink we ordered. Then I tried to explain to him do you not have the drink or did you guys just run out of the strawberry puree. Then again he states just the puree. So then I said OK well we want the same drink we order just minus the strawberry puree. He didn't understand because his answer was we don't have the drink. So I asked to speak with he manager. The manager took his sweet time coming to the table mean while our food came out. Nice and hot a fresh but took then forever to get the food out to us.  Manager finally showed up and I explain the situation to him and he had a dumb founded look on his face as if we were wrong and the waiter was right. He stated the waiter rung in a mango Margarita and that's the drink we have in front of us. Then I explained again that we didn't order a mango Margarita that we order a Maui Margarita with all the extras. After auguring with him for about 6 mins he finally left and  made us the correct drinks but he had a look on his face as if he didn't want to.Needless to say they finally got the drink right but my experience with the waiter and the manager left a bad taste in my mouth and I will never return back to this restaurant or tell my friend and family to go. There waiter and management need some serious training in customer service.Instead of the Manager just try to correct the issue he want to argue with me. Neither the waiter or manager apologized for the situation."}
{"text":"Service was HORRIBLE!!! We waited 45mins for food! Then when we got it! It was COLD!!!! Then we didn't even get all our food together! My daughter had to wait for her food!!! Keep in mind it's a Tuesday so it's not that busy!!!!! Then when we asked for a manager!!! It seem like she was bothered by our complaint!! 
Ok they took care of the whole bill. I was some what pleased with that to compensate for the long wait. No doubt the food was good so I can't take that away from them. I'm just guessing my waitress was really busy to get our food at a adequate time...."}
{"text":"Went here last night to celebrate my aunts bday and we absolutely loved it. The service was amazing as well. The Wisconsin cheese curds and chicken tenders were amazing and absolute must if you come. The tenders tasted crispy with a unique batter. I ordered the bbq chicken and ribs while my fiancé ordered the montecristo. We had apple crisp for dessert as well. Come hungry because the servings are huge!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were so glad to hear a Cheddars was open here in Chandler!! We used to go to the one in his home state Texas. We've been here a few times actually and every time we've been it's been great. We've never once had to wait to be seated, we always get a booth we request, and the service is always fast, food is always good, and price is always worth it!! They provide so much food for the price you pay and I love how the appetizers are also cheap but filling. I love the buffalo chicken wraps and the spinach cheese dip. Also try out the raspberry sweet tea!!"}
{"text":"Love the location in Tucson never have an issue when we go to that location. The food is always good and very reasonably priced. This location however seems to have service issues. The manager tonight informed me that she would remove the fries from the bill THIS ONE TIME because the waitress failed to tell us they weren't included with the burger. I was fine up until she kept saying JUST THIS ONE TIME as if she was doing me a favor? Seriously the waitress asked if fries were ok and my son said yes. Where in that would I think fries were extra? Disappointed for the second time in management which is too bad because we really enjoy the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars. The food came out late and cold, one of the orders was wrong and to top it all off there was a cockroach that crawled on the wall to the ceiling at the booth next to us which made their little boy cry. Bad service, bad food, and a very unclean atmosphere. When the management came out to the table next to us they tried to explain that it was a palmetto bug and due to rain last night it wasn't her fault. What kind of Management does that? Unbelievable and will never be back."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! I wished I would have taken a pic but I needed to eat it asap. I was so hungry and it looked delicious. I ordered the chicken pot pie and we all shared some appetizers. The onion rings were good and I rarely like them. Crispy & flavorful, not just grease. The waiter Jason was great and extremely attentive to our large group. I would go back, just for his service. Its clean, plenty of room for a large group. Its not too noisy. We were given fresh cookies when we checked out! They have a great way of making you feel like you made the right choice  giving them your business. Thumbs up and all stars! Thank you and I/We will be back."}
{"text":"Cheddar's reminds me of every sad yet comical movie about a large, casual and American restaurant (think Chotchkie's from Office Space or  Shenaniganz from Waiting). They've got big food, a wait staff that seems to hate their lives and the classic dish of butter served with a little croissant. 

I went in on the Thursday after New Years with a group of family. Despite the parking lot being packed to the brim, we were seated immediately at a booth next to a jumbo sized silk fern. The main room does have some really slow spinning fans that I guess were kind of neat. The menu is large and has all of the staples of these sorts of restaurants - wraps, salads, sandwiches, soup, chicken fingers, steaks, burgers, etc. 

I ordered the fish tacos with a curve ball side of broccoli and cheese casserole (broccoli casseroles are my anti-drug/ kryptonite). The two grilled fish tacos came with slaw, tomatoes and a spicy sauce.  I actually liked my tacos.  Two people at the table ordered the soup (which was apparently VERY salty) and salad combo.  The salads came out really quickly BUT they were missing the infamous butter drenched croissants! Our waitress told us they were out for the moment, but when I looked up I literally saw other waiters bringing them out of the kitchen.  It was another 15 minutes before the replacement croissants came and another 10 or so before the rest of our meals came. Our waitress was pretty MIA for most of our meal.   

The portions are astronomically huge at Cheddar's.  While the fish tacos were a normal portion, the regular sized salad, burgers, sandwiches and wraps I saw could have fed a whole family.  The prices are reasonable so either split your meal or know you are going to have some leftovers. 

I don't especially love chain restaurants like Cheddar's to begin with.  While I liked my food, the spotty service, ridiculous portions, plain menu and withholding of croissants were not so great.  At the end of the day, we all love a buttered croissant so I'll probably be back, but I hope service is better next time."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for here. Ordered the steak and shrimp with mashed potatoes and green beans, the Boyfriend had the blackened salmon with broccoli and mash.. Both dishes were just average. I'm sure I would've done a better job in my own kitchen. If nothing else, I will definitely be back for the margaritas!"}
{"text":"Once you walk in the doors to this place, you're invited into a dark and very casual-esque environment. The employee attire is a black dress shirt with dark colored dickies pants, and dark shoes that complements the overall decor of the restaurant quite well. I usually sit at the bar, wait time for the food is never long, roughly 10-15 minutes, service is always good. Definitely a very date-friendly place as well. And the Monte Cristo. This place is about an hour away from me and I drove here just for that because I know how good they usually are from the Cheddar's I would always go to back in Oklahoma. Their Monte Cristo is literally hands-down, the best fried sandwich ever. Perfectly crisp to the bite, served with raspberry preservatives (a great combination), and was well worth the drive! The side of macaroni that I had was also really good! I've been trying to branch off and try some of their other food, but I always end up running right back to their Monte Cristo. Amazeballs. Every bite is exquisite and it puts a smile on your face!

Overall experience and taste;
I'm feeling a light to decent 9/10 for this place.

Ya'll know this is just my experience right?"}
{"text":"Cheddar's is like any other chain restaurant at this price level.  Not bad.  Not great either.  Do I ever regret eating there?  No.  Am I really excited to go back?  No.  Well, maybe for a couple of things.  About a month ago my husband and I stopped in for dinner.  I ordered the ribs and fried shrimp and he ordered the sirloin and chicken tenders.  The beer choices were really not that interesting.  He ended up with a Sam Adams Oktoberfest and said it went well with his meal.

Now, here's where I get excited.  The Texas Sweet Tea.  That is one tasty adult beverage, and at $3.79 a very good price.  I could get really ornery on a few of those.  I also love their warm croissants.  Three of those are $2.99 and they are delicious!

My ribs were a little dry but the fried shrimp was good.  Nice and lightly breaded, and not overcooked.  My side of mac and cheese was delicious, but very small.  About 3 bites.  The green beans were flavorless, like they had been sitting in water all day.  My husband had ordered the sirloin med rare and it came out med well.  Just ugh.  It was edible, but just barely.  The chicken tenders were ok, but seemed like they had been sitting for awhile.  His side of broccoli was good.

Overall it's just a real \"meh\" experience for us.  John took great care of us in the bar.  He was busting his butt taking care of customers at the bar and in the booths like we were.  He's 5 stars all the way, but when we were finished, the total with tip was close to $55.  While we were walking to the car I asked my husband if he felt that was a 50-dollar meal.  He said, \"No way.  Should have gone to Firebirds for that amount of money.\"  I totally agree.  I could see us stopping in for a couple of drinks or something, but the food just doesn't excite me.  There are some much better places right across the street."}
{"text":"Never go on a Friday night unless you have time to kill. Beyond packed! Food is good.  I had the crispy chicken salad w/ honey mustard - delish. They serve this little honey butter croissant like roll on the side that just melts in your mouth.  I was mad I only got one. Pricing is reasonable, for 2 adults and one child it was $30.15. For burger with fries,  kids chicken tenders meal, and my salad plus drinks and a beer. You can't beat that!"}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING. Probably the best food i've had in awhile! The place was clean & our server Micah was wonderful! She was so kind and funny and paid attention to what we wanted. I can't get over how delicious our food was, we'll definitely be back and i will for sure be recommending this place to all my friends!"}
{"text":"When I visit family in Charlotte I request to go here. Its cheap and my palate is satisfied. The food is traditonal chain food fare and at times I crave that. My likes: the buttery sweet warm crossiants, spinach dip, and the nachos. This is a place you can take anyone..your baby niece, your grandmother, your brother and everyone is happy unless they are a food snob. The wait staff is slow but its Charlotte and the south is traditionally slow with service."}
{"text":"This place was delicious and the serving sizes were huge. One dessert cake fed 6! The decor is so finely chosen and cohesive inside. Plus, for the quality of food we received, the prices were extremely moderate. I got a steak entree for around $10 plus 2 sides! I requested to come here for all my upcoming birthdays anniversaries etc. A strong recommendation to visit!"}
{"text":"Food tasted good, but they won't let you make substitutions and to somebody who has to eat gluten-free and dairy free was disappointing. Our waiter was excellent and he apologized that substitutions weren't allowed."}
{"text":"My husband really likes this place, so we came here.  However, I am gluten free.  They do have a gluten free menu, but it is not very big.  Everything offered is without sauce - like bbq ribs without sauce, salmon without sauce, chicken without seasoning.  There is one saiad on the GF menu, a chicken salad with candied pecans, but you have to skip the pecans and can only get balsamic vinaigrette or french dressing.  None of that sounded good, so I wound up ordering a bun-less burger and fries.  It was okay - it was a huge burger so it was filling, but the bacon on it was too salty.  They have a kid's menu with plenty of options - the mac n cheese was too fancy for my daughter - it had a bread crust on top and the apples with yogurt is chopped up green apples mixed with yogurt and golden raisins.  My son said it was very tart."}
{"text":"Cheddar's is a scratch kitchen (no ready prepared food) chain originally from Texas. Chandler is the first city to get one here in AZ. I thought I'd try it out and see why they are so popular in the southern states. Great looking restaurant with some neat decor (love the aquarium). Just a little on the dark side when it comes to lighting. The server did a good job, but I didn't care for the \"homemade\" queso appetizer. I've made better at home and the presentation of it wasn't the greatest. But I will say the chicken tenders and the chicken fried steak were fantastic. The meat in the CFS was tender and the outside was nice and crispy. It's a nice family restaurant that fits in perfectly with Chandler culture so I give it a slight thumbs up."}
{"text":"Service slow...OK, very slow as the waiter disappeared for 10 mins  at a time without coming into view.  Portions are good, food is nothing special, prices will not break the bank.  Panhandle hit us up before we exited the vehicle."}
{"text":"Solid competitor with reasonable prices to Cracker Barrel, with a kicking bar and modern design tones.  I could not believe the prices.  Average entree less than $12.  All sorts of drink specials like Texas Margarita at $3.99 for a giant salt rimmed refreshing lip smacking drink. Started off with the croissants piping hot smothered in honey!  Then had the dinner portion of fried and battered chicken breasts, 2 monsters crispy and piping hot over Texas toast smothered in peppery white gravy of the gods.  Side of garlic mashed and southern green beans overfilling the plate.  Loved this dish and brought half home for under $25, wow.  Place was packed with happy satisfied customers, including me."}
{"text":"Don't Drink the Water Here!  

Consider this a PSA - you've been warned!
Really, what gives Cheddar's?

Employees, Management and Corporate all acknowledge a long-standing issue with water taste and quality here.  Municipal water does NOT taste this bad; even unfiltered Chandler water.  I was told the water is filtered, but I have a difficult time believing that.  There is some serious subterranean defect that is contributing to the water issue here; I have not encountered such an aversion to water anywhere else like this before. 

Yes, it is that bad that my whole review is dedicated to how me and my dining companions could not find enjoyment in our meal (in an otherwise acceptable food experience) because of the water offered for consumption.  It was so bad that we each needed to order beer and wine just to avoid the water source here.

The food served here is acceptable and is what should be expected from a chain such as Darden; average food that could and would be elevated by other experiences yet falls short.

What is not acceptable is the oversight in addressing the quality and taste of the tap water served here.

The service is typical Darden Restaurants which is to say that it is a bit heavy handed on greeters, bussers and upper management wandering about, and not heavy enough on quality food preparation, capable line cooks, proper execution of recipes or focused enough on consistent food prep in the kitchen. 

Our table unanimously agreed that the food was tasty (although two steaks had to be sent back to the kitchen to be re-made) however, the experience in dealing with beverages here was NOT acceptable - nor was the solution: \"We have tea and soda.\"  \"The water in the tea is heated and does not that that bad.\"  Really?  It's still the same water in those beverages as it is in this awful water glass!

The atmosphere was trendy and appropriate given the cuisine and price.  I just couldn't help but think that the water in the fish tank displayed in the dining room would taste better that what is served - I remember looking around at other tables to see if other diners had issues with their water but all their tables seemed to knowingly be devoid of water glasses.  Maybe they were forewarned about the water.

Overall, I think that Cheddar's has a good concept and acceptable food.  I will return just to see if the water situation has been addressed, however, I am not counting on much change to something that you do not pay for.  Alas, I feel that I am clearly in the minority of water snobbiness, but consider yourself warned: BYOB.

And, by the way, Don't Drink the Water!

{"text":"I would be cautious about eating at this establishment.  My husband is suffering from horrible food poisoning after eating lunch there yesterday.  He had the lemon pepper wings, onion rings and a chicken bowl.  He's had food poisoning before, but never this bad, so beware!  This is disappointing because we have dined here multiple times and love Cheddar's but I don't know if we can go back without expecting the worst."}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! I had the baby back ribs and chicken tenders, and they were excellent. Juicy and cooked to perfection. My wife had the grilled tilapia and shrimp, and she loved it. We had the apple pie alemode, and it was the right portion size, and delicious. Our server was Brandon, and he outstanding, as usual."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night needing some good food after a business conference as I was at the point of being hangry. My man, my mom and I walked in and you could tell the food here had to be good 'cause there were a bunch of people waiting for a table. To our surprise, however, we were told the wait would only be between 11-17 mins which was awesome!!! So we waited for literally 5 minutes and a very pleasant server walked up and told us there was seating available in the bar area -- which means we didn't have to wait!!! Yay! 

Within minutes our server, Xavier, came over and took our drink order, and we also ordered the spinach artichoke dip. By the time he brought our drinks, we already knew what we wanted to order... Fish tacos, Dijon Chicken and Mushrooms, and Steak & Shrimp. He barely walked away to put in our order before he came around the corner again to bring out the spinach and artichoke dip. Phenomenal!!! Ooey gooey melted cheese with spinach, topped with a dollop of sour cream, along with freshly made chips, and a side of salsa. Ya, we devoured it pretty quick! 

Minutes later, our food arrived bubbling hot from the kitchen, smelling divine! Everything was so flavorful and tasty, we nearly licked the plates clean! Needless to say, the service, food, and atmosphere was absolutely great!!! We came in extremely famished/hangry, but we definitely left satisfied and happy! Well done, Cheddar's, another group of happy customers! 

P.S. Anyone that gave Cheddar's a less than perfect review must've gone on a terrible evening; or perhaps your tastebuds misled you... So try it again, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this experience was underwhelming. Too bad, I had high hopes for this visit as I had been wanting to try Cheddars for a while. The restaurant is very inviting but the charm ends there. Our server was lackluster.  When we asked for suggestions for ordering sides she said \"whatever you want is good.\"  She gave a disinterested attitude and didn't have

 answers to any of our questions.  

The food... the BBQ chicken and ribs combo was decent but didn't impress.  Still, no big complaints about that. One member of our party had the soup and sides combo and the sides were so bland he didn't eat most of it.  When he declined a take home box, the server, who could clearly see the meal wasn't hardly touched, didn't even ask if he was dissatisfied.  They apparently can't be bothered to get a water filter because the water tastes terrible, so get a soda or something to drink.  

Bottom line:  The prices were very reasonable, but the food is hit or miss and the service is less than impressive.  I don't see myself going back."}
{"text":"This is one of our go-to places, the menu has a great selection to ensure everybody can find something they'll enjoy. In addition to that, we have always been pleased with the taste and quality of our meal and the service has also been good."}
{"text":"Gave this one star because thats the lowest it goes. if you want to go crossaints go for it, but i prefer to warm up my own TV dinners. service is crap too."}
{"text":"The outside reminded me of Mimi's cafe and automatically assumed that the food was going to be mediocre, but I should always remember to not judge a book by it's cover as cliche as it sounds.

Anyway, it was my birthday and my parents wanted to treat me for a nice lunch to which we all decided after looking online at what cheddar's was all about, to try it out.

When we got there, the inside looked amazing, a bit upscale and the menu selection looked inviting and I was happy about the combination choices as well, given that I am that person that needs to try everything. 

We ordered the stack of onion rings as an appetizer which was delicious. I also ordered strawberry lemonade which was really good, a bit on the sweet side though. For an entree, I had a half rack of ribs/fried shrimp combo with fries and a side of mac and cheese which was amazing. 

I would definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"We visited Cheddars on a Wednesday at 6pm for dinner.  It was about a 15-20 minute wait for a table for 4 on a day that usually would be less busy.  Decor is nice and they have a pretty fish tank.

My husband enjoyed his big stack of onion rings.  Otherwise the food was pretty mediocre and over priced in my opinion.  You could get similar food at a Chilis with no wait and half the check in my opinion.  The food was about the same quality.  

My husband also had a burger, and I had chicken fingers.  2 people in our party had a beer, but no desserts and we still ended up with an $80 + tab before tip.  It seems expensive for pretty typical 3 star food in my opinion.  Nothing outstanding here."}
{"text":"We had a gift card to this place so we decided to give it a try. There was a 10 minutes wait, which is fine, but then our server who sat us took us around like she didn't know where she was sitting us, and then dropped the menus at a table and walked away. Then our waitress came to take our drink order and after she was there and he commented \"does everyone here hate their jobs\". Our food came out fast, and was delivered by someone who wasn't our server and our server was cleaning the booth behind us and asked from there if we needed anything else. Our drinks were never refilled, and our server did not come by at all after our food was dropped off. I was waiting to ask for a dressing but she never came back. Finally, we get our bill at give her the gift card. She comes back and says it is not working and just stands there like we are trying not to pay. My husband gave her our debit card and we pay and leave. We call the number of the back of the gift card from the parking lot and it says we have $25 on it. So now we are still stuck with this gift card. Food was cheap, but service was awful."}
{"text":"Being a somewhat regular at Cheddars..you want to get the cheese fries. You will alao want to bring many friends to share the HUGE portion with. The food is pretty tasty with a low price for a sit down place..while I was there last night the wait staff had a pretty bad attitude and 3 waiters 2 cooks and a manager were on the patio having a pretty loud discussion with some customers. Talk about awkward. Ive been here many a time and not seen anything to that extent before, so I'm sure ill go back. Also if you plan on going on a Sunday make it is before 1230."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times before and always enjoyed it, but last night was the last night I will eat there. My wife and ordered drinks. She had one of their punches and I had a pina colada. Both were very good. She ordered the Hawaiian Chicken Salad and I had Chicken Tenders, buffalo style. When my wife bit down on part of her salad, she bit down on a piece of metal! It looked similar to a razor blade, but the manager said that it was something broken off from one of the pieces of their equipment. While the managers comped our food and that was good, both of us had lost our appetites.  While this may have been a freak accident, kitchen equipment should be inspected before it is used. Like I said, we will not be back."}
{"text":"All you need to know about Cheddar's is that it serves good comfort food and has a well stocked, ample bar area.  

We came here on a Friday night around five. Cheddar's was in the middle of it's opening week growing pains. We were told there was a ten to fifteen minute wait, and nearly fifty-five minutes later, we were seated. LOL

As noted above, the food makes up for the confusion at the hostess station. The servers were on top of their game, and many were backing each other up, busing each other's tables. Nice!

The atmosphere was busy as you could imagine.  But, Jeff the Manager was walking around, keeping a watchful eye on things. He made a point of visiting each table and greeting guests by saying: \"welcome to your new favorite neighbor restaurant,\". It worked on us. Double, nice!!

The menu is mixture of burgers and steaks, with the prices being extraordinarily reasonable. The half pound burgers on the menu were only$6.29-6.79, with the chicken and steaks around $11-14. 

We started with two ice teas, one regular, the other a Long Island.  Surprisingly they were less than $2.00 apart and came out almost immediately. Did I mention our server Lori was good?  She treated us as if we were her only table!

After the teas arrive, we decided to try the Spinach Dip (see photo) for $5.99. It was very tasty, served with light tortilla chips and warm salsa. 

For our entree, we ordered a half rack of BBQ ribs ($10.79)and the Rib-Eye Philly Steak Sandwich ($8.49).  The ribs had a nice smokey taste. While the only downside was the sandwich, which seemed to have more mushrooms than steak.  

As mentioned above prices are very reasonable, and yes we'll be back after the newness and crowds settled down. Expect to pay around $25 each, including one drink each, one appetizer, taxes and gratuities. 

So Three and a half Stars \"A-Okay\". But this might change, since Cheddar's has the potential to become a goto neighbor restaurant."}
{"text":"Chuck, the Manager on duty, was amazing and very hospitable. He made sure that our experience was top notch! Our waiter Travis continued to show he truly cared by getting us everything we needed. The food was all amazing, fresh, and quick!! I will definitely be going back and hope this same team is working!!"}
{"text":"Food was decent, price was great.  The place looked really clean and the service was good.  I wasn't blown away but I don't get the 1 star reviews.  Some people just feel a little too entitled."}
{"text":"The place was very busy but we were still seated promptly. The server was friendly and pretty attentive. The tortilla soup was \"meh\". The chicken fried steak was HUGE. Easily enough for 2-3 servings. Mashed potatoes were decent, cheese curds were tasty with a unique panko type coating. Broccoli cheese casserole was exceedingly cheesy with rice and a little broccoli. Overall, good home style food. A little heavy for our taste but I can see how others would enjoy it."}
{"text":"My mouth waters every time I think of this restaurant. Some of my favorite things include the potato skins, curds, croissants, and chicken fried steak! You can't beat their cheap alcoholic drinks either. My favorite is the Texas sweet tea."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Anytime we are near Chandler we always go out to dinner or lunch here. The ribs here are the best ribs I have ever had as well as the chicken fingers. 

Great food, great atmosphere, and family friendly."}
{"text":"Just like any other chain restaurant... Not bad for the price. Food is good but not great. Although their croissants and $5 margaritas are what makes me give them 4 stars. Ambiance and service is nice as well. It's not date night worthy but I would probably go again with the kids."}
{"text":"The service is usually good, staff is friendly. I usually order the chicken with french fries. The chicken is sometimes slimy, so I end up eating like half of it. Service is good, food.. Not so much."}
{"text":"Service is ... insecure. 

Was there with a group of six and we all thought it was so-so. This is what I imagine the food is like in an upscale retirement home.

The place is beautiful inside."}
{"text":"I was actually kind of excited to visit this place, however my entire experience was negative. We came on a Sunday the decor was kinda cool and it was pretty full. We were seated immediately. Our waitress looked like she had something better to do and when I asked if I had soup and salad she said they didn't have that combo and that she didn't make the menu. Understandable. But her attitude never changed. My boyfriend ordered a BBQ burger and loved it and then we decided to order a pazookie. Huge mistake. After 30 minutes the manager came and said the pazookie was dropped on the floor and they are getting a new one. We waited another 30 mins for our new one and when it finally came we were excited to eat it. Upon diving in we moved the ice cream over and seriously found a pubic hair in our pazookie between the I've cream and cookie. Completely ruined our appetite. Because of our overall experience I will not be returning and would not recommend this place to anybody looking for an uplifting place to eat. Thumbs down."}
{"text":"You can skip this place. It's another chain with what they would call fresh food I would call it prepared food in a set menu. There's no creativity the chicken sandwich was 1/10th the thickness of the bread I could barely find the chicken. My buddy had the Spasagna and it was cold in the middle and the noodles were all mashed together. this place is just not good. Cool from the outside, not good on the inside. People who like this place have very low standards in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is my first time to this restaurant which was recommended to me by some friends. Cheddar's is very large with many seating areas including one outside. Nicely decorated, with  booths throughout. A huge saltwater tank and Polynesian style fans in the main dinning room.Very crowed for a Thursday night. Lots of noise. You can easily hear all the gossip that your neighbor is talking about. The waitstaff was very attentive and at my table minutes after I  sat down. The food was really good. My husband and I really enjoyed  our meal.  It was filling and a relaxing  night.  Would we go back?  We already have."}
{"text":"This was a great place to eat... now I'm just unsatisfied with Cheddar's. The food is great ever since I have remembered but after tonight I lost my appetite. My fiancé found a hair mixed in his casserole, the server gave us poor service, but yet I still tipped her $4. 

We left a note on the table because my fiancé has been in the business industry over 5 years and in our restaurant we go get the manager right away even if the server has already asks them \"if they want a refund, a new plate, I don't know or to talk to the manager\".

 The server here never apologized or never got the manager to talk to us even though we were speechless with her and said \"give us some time\" 

We had to ask for a refill and for our check. IT WAS NOT BUSY, get it together!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, like all Cheddar's. However service was terrible. 24 minutes for drinks. The only time we were checked on by our waitress was when we flagged her down, however she checked on all of her other tables around us. Hmmmmm"}
{"text":"Food was good, server Rachel M has a attitude or having a bad night, but gives her NO reason to take it out on me  and treat me rude, I will make sure next time I'm there I do not get her again. She's rude!!
Also please make sure someone attends the restrooms, men's bathroom had no soap, paper towels and a mess of toilet paper on the floor."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice, once for dinner once for lunch and well, it's just \"okay\". 

The citrus miso salmon was good, the ribs/shrimp so-so, bacon cheeseburger ok, chicken bacon sandwich forgettable. Service was good both times, during our dinner visit the manager came around to inquire about the meal/service which was a nice touch. 

The restuarant is very loud, parking can be a problem depending on the day/time.The prices are good, maybe due to smaller portions. On the receipt they figure the tip for you which seemed like a nice touch, however they figure it with the TAX! Uh, no thank you I can figure 15-20% on my own and it doesn't inclue tipping on the tax. 

This is a restaurant you settle for I wouldn't go out of my way for it. I'm guessing the reason for the 4 & 5 star reviews is due to the location near the mall and the plethora of bad chains to choose from."}
{"text":"Very clean cool atmosphere. 
Food was very good with fair prices. 
I am happy I picked this place over the other chains in the area. 
Reason for only 4 stars is due to the service. 
My waitress was horrible as we still had our previous course on table when next course came out and she never cleaned off the table. 
Felt very rushed. The manager was running around the floor so quick it was impossible to grab her. I am not sure if this place is new, that could explain the customer service issues but overall very good and place is very very nice looking. I had a great seat in front of the fish tank which was very clean. The bar is a great size and in a joining adjacent room to keep the noise down from people dinning. Awesome setup. I would hope on my next visit, service will be better."}
{"text":"My family and I have been several times and the food is always really good.  The problem is the wait.  We went at 5 on a Sat. and people were already waiting 20 minutes to be seated.  I just thought it's because it's so good.  No it was because they wouldn't seat people.  There were several tables in every section empty.  My guess is they didn't have enough wait staff to cover all the tables.  That makes no sense to me.  If you are a popular restaurant and you know you are full and will have people waiting on the weekends then have enough staff to use your entire facility. No one should have to wait when plenty of tables are open.  I would rather wait at the table and be told that it will be a few minutes then stand outside and wait in the heat."}
{"text":"Cheddars is just all around good food at a decent price. The service was great, our server keep our drinks filled & checked on us often. If you go you must must must get the croissant bread pudding. It is simply outstanding."}
{"text":"Food is not as good as the location in Gastonia..neither is the service!! 

This location tried to give a much smaller portion of salad that Gastonia. ..that is until we requested more as it should've been in the first place. Guess they tried to pull a fast one but didn't realize we are regulars at the other location."}
{"text":"I thought this restaurant is very cute.  The service was amazing.  I was impressed by the menu options and price.  The alcoholic beverages are fun and super cheap.  The size is large and very potent.  I had their version of Long Island Iced tea and LOVED it.  For dinner I tried the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich with macaroni and cheese.  I think I would try something else next time.  My friend had chicken pot pie.  She liked it.  I didn't like the face that the crust was only on top.  My daughter had the pasta with marinara and was happy about it.  Her friend had the fried shrimp.  It looked okay.  Looking forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"This is my first visit to a Cheddar's (I assume it is a chain).  The restaurant was very nice inside.  Brick walls, tile floors, nice booths, and a nice freshwater African cichlids aquarium behind the bar.  There are televisions placed throughout the restaurant. I was able to watch the Utah Jazz vs. Phoenix Suns game (the Jazz beat them, but I'm from Utah so that was a good thing.  :)

I ordered the queso and chips to start my meal.  The queso was good.  The chips were okay.  A few weren't crispy.

For the main course I order the 20 oz. bone-in ribeye, medium.  For my sides I chose the loaded baked potato and the mac and cheese.  The steak was good, a little over medium toward the ourside, but perfect near the bone.  The mac and cheese was excellent.  I could eat a whole bowl of the mac and cheese alone. The baked potato was cook well.

Michael my waiter was great.  Refills came fast.  He knew the menu well and was very personable.  The manager stopped by part way through my meal to make sure \"everything was okay\".

Overall a great steak and a good meal."}
{"text":"The food was okay. I really like the fries. The entree was just like any other American cafe. Service could have been better. I was not offered a refill and my server took forever with my check"}
{"text":"Chicken fried chicken, Bomb! It's juicy and crispy and as good as it comes. Started with scratch onion rings, they do ranch right. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My family and I must have caught them on a bad day. Our initial wait time was about 5 to 10 minutes but it was almost 10 minutes before someone took our food and drink order. After another 15 minutes I asked the hostess to track down our waitress, because we had not received our drinks yet. I even found the a lady that said she was the manager and informed her, she really seemed to care less. Our drinks finally came and were told the croissants were coming fresh out of the oven. Once we got them they were not completely done but the parts that were done were pretty tasty. My husband ordered the salmon with rice, which he said was average. My step-son ordered ribs, no complaints, but he eats anything. My daughter had chicken strips and fries, which she seemed to like. I ordered the country fried steak, when I cut it open, the meat seem to deflate and a large amount of juice came out to reveal a purplish color meat. I was not too sure but  took a bite anyway. I decided not to finish the meal. The waitress was very nice and offered to order me something else and put it on rush. Initially I told her that it was fine I just wanted to leave the restaurant and not have to wait another 45 minutes for food. I gave in and carried out a bourbon pork chop. 
The waitress was also servicing a table next to us, I noticed that she had gotten their order wrong a couple of times. 
Upon finishing our meal our check was debited for the wrong amount, once it was corrected we hurried to leave the restaurant. Upon our exit another couple mentioned to the hostess that they had been seated but were leaving because no one came to take their order. The hostess unapologetically sounding said that she was sorry.. it seems as though customer service and quality of food are not a concern for this establishment. I do not recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Short review....decent home-style food served at a decent price. Nothing to write home about. First time here, but a solid option when in the University Area. I'm a NOTORIOUS \"anti-chain\" snob but HAD to check this place out before I took my French Language Class.

In TRYING to eat somewhat healthy, I had a chicken dish with a mustard cream sauce, over rice and served with steamed veggies. Actually the flavor profile was pretty darn good! Surprising to this Foodie...but hey, it's ALWAYS great to be pleasantly surprised...ESPECIALLY when they don't rob your wallet!!!"}
{"text":"We went here on Saturday 3/19/16 for my cousin's birthday dinner! Worst experience ever!!! it took our waiter a good 30-35 minuets to get our drink order which he ended up messing that up and after he took the drink order he told us to \"not play musical chairs\" why this was said to 12 adults as if we were at a party I have no clue. The waiter ran of and then came the manager asking if we had a problem with out waiter and if we wanted  a new one which we said yes too and walked away...well 10 minutes later here comes the same damn waiter with the incomplete and incorrect drink order. We go on he try's to correct it the another 10 minutes go by and he's ready for the food order which he repeated correctly but when we got the food 5 out of 12 of us didn't get half of our food. We asked for condiments and butter which he kept forgetting which was expected for the way the night had already played out. Not to mention we were sat in a corner where there was no air at all so we asked them to open the door on the patio which they did. Needless to say the service was crap and the food was blah so I will not be back here. We get better service at Denny and our orders are correct!"}
{"text":"We had discovered Cheddar's while traveling out west so were delighted to find one in Gastonia.  Skiing over the weekend, we were on our way back, it was Sunday, it was lunch time and we just knew that we would find something we liked at Cheddar's.

The menu us a work of art.  Selections are many and prices are very reasonable.  Wait staff have to hustle, especially on days like Sundays and they have the patience to listen to you and to accommodate the personal preferences you have for your orders.

Their lunch combos are such a good deal.  You assemble your lunch from  sandwiches, soups, salads and other entrees for as little as $8.99.  Beverages are extra.

We both had burgers with salads and tea.  The salads were of significant size so could pass for a meal on their own.  And the entree salads are even larger.  Dressings, with some exceptions, are made in-house.

That said, Cheddar's prides themselves as a \"scratch kitchen.\"  And that shows in the quality of the meals.  But...it might take a little longer with some meals than others because it is not pre-made.  Your patience will be rewarded.

This Gastonia location is clean, well-run and typical of the chain.  An excellent meal choice across-the-board."}
{"text":"It doesn't deserve one star! The managers are crass and homophobic. They put us in a corner booth that had dried food on it. The waiter was friendly but that was it! They \"lost\" our ticket then the floor manager briefly ran by slapped the table said sorry its coming. Then the food came out cold not fresh as promised! I asked for the GM who came out with an attitude! He said he would not be able to do anything for those that ate regardless of it being an hour late or cold. Saturday night going out and this is your only stop for food... I tried to have a private convo with the GM and he called me a faggot then returned to the kitchen after shoving the corporate number in my hand. This place needs negative stars!"}
{"text":"Comfort American food. I imagine this place will do well regardless of it's glaring negative aspects (service, attention to detail, etc) because the prices are low low low. 

Despite the name, my husband and I tired it because it looked so nice from the outside, the inside looks nice as well, like an upscale diner. It was hands down the worst service we each had ever had. We weren't even mad, you kinda have to laugh plus we felt so sorry for our server, there was a manger going to all the tables surrounding us and apologizing. We attributed that to opening restaurant jitters and went back 3 weeks later. It was exactly the same experience, food was ok, when we finally got what we ordered, which most times we didn't. It's like all the servers there not only are new to serving, but completely new to writing things down and remembering them later. 

All in all, this a great place to take people if you are patient and don't want to spend a lot of money. For my money, I'll be going across the parking lot to Mimi's. The money saved isn't worth the headache."}
{"text":"To say that we love this place would be an understatement!! Great place to eat. Everyone was nice and helpful. Food was amazing!!! Cafe price with high end ambiance! Great prices, large portions and taste was amazing! My husband got the spasagna (baked spaghetti). He loved it!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. We were sat right away our food was prompt ,and delicious. Our server was amazing. The monte cristo and the chicken strips are something I would order again"}
{"text":"It's just like every other casual sit-down restaurant: better than fast food, but ultimately the same fare bought from the same wholesaler, served by UNCC students, and completely uninspired.    

And packed the the gills.  There are some things I'll never understand about Charlotte.  ;)"}
{"text":"My God that was some big portions! I was a little disappointed in the macaroni and cheese. There were more bread crumbs than noodles. The corn was just right. It took forever for us to be seated but it was okay. 
My sister's Baja chicken had an uncomfortable amount of beans. Lets just say the chicken was overpowered by beans and the minimum amount of rice.
My brother loved the bourbon glazed salmon though."}
{"text":"Ceddar's can do no wrong! Waiting for a table at times can be a little disheartening but the food is worth it. The service is always great and the waiters seem to generally like working with customers. The food is great and comes at an affordable price.  I know this is a chain but the University location seems like a singular neighborhood spot. Try a flavored lemonade or their hot and buttered rolls!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Baja chicken and received a bowl of beans and bay leaves with a drizzle of rice and pico. Ordered croissants and they came when I received my check! I will never spend my money with them ever again! Point Blank Period!"}
{"text":"Cheddars is a good fall back restaurant. For us, its one of those places you go when you have no idea where to go or what to eat. Its good for large family gatherings, the food is reasonably priced (getting pricier), and its a cool atmosphere. The steaks are good, when you don't feel like cooking your own & just want a quick steak. The chicken tenders are large, cooked well and not greasy. The star of the show is the drinks. The have good Foo Foo drinks at a good price. Everyone at the table loves them. I had a Jack & Coke last night and I could actually taste the Jack for $5.99. Not bad."}
{"text":"Cheddar's was amazing! We first dined at Cheddar's their second day open and consistently since then. Their food is amazing with fairly big proportions. The Monte Cristo is so delicious! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Arrived here on a busy Monday afternoon and was seated immediately by a very polite staff. Our waiter, Ed, was very friendly and attentive. We ordered appetizers and it felt like it was only 5 minutes and they were already at our table. We only got to enjoy about a quarter of the appetizers and then the main dishes were out. Food was great! We never had to ask for more drinks as Ed was on top of it. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Cheddar's was ok, nothing spectacular. The ambience is better than the food. Great staff, nice manager, but the food is average like an Applebees. I order the steak and shrimp which was good but my husband's chicken was like Boston Market. For the prices I don't think we'll be back. It was just nothing special. I recommend going if someone else is paying or if it's someone's birthday and they selected this place."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time at Cheddars. We stopped by after shopping at IKEA. At first I was a little nervous because the hosts took about 2 minutes to actually greet us just to tell us there was a 20 minute wait. We decided to eat in the bar area which was surprisingly fast! I loved our waitress. The burger I ordered was great. The apple pie desert is a must. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"5 stars for Mike!!! I don't EVER write reviews but i had to download yelp to write one about what a great time we had tonight. My parents and myself came in and it was our first time and we couldn't have had a better experience thanks to our server. He was clearly busy for a thursday night and still was so attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. We really enjoyed talking with him and our food was great. Not to mention we said our goodbye to Mike and he chased us down with cookies! This place is awesome and we'll definitely come back thanks to him"}
{"text":"We went and waited more than 30 minutes before the server came to the table. When we got our food it was cold and my sister still had the wrapper on the cheese that was on her burger! I will not be returning."}
{"text":"nice atmosphere, clean restrooms, great service and wait staff went above and beyond.....but the marginal \"hot\" food is not worth a return visit. I order the Dijon Chicken with mushrooms,  The mushrooms tasted and looked like they were from a can, not fresh. Edible but that's the best I can say. My husband ordered the Salmon with Mango Salsa.  Looked great and he liked it.  Very affordable but again,  the food  is NOT worth returning for a second visit."}
{"text":"Came here for a date night while in Charlotte visiting IKEA. We had had Cheddars before but at the Winston-Salem location and loved it. This location was very hard to love. Our server was not attentive at all. Had to get our own silverware off of another table, one of our appetizers came out 2 minutes before our meals. Our croissants weren't put in at all, I had to remind our server about them. Our entrees came out cold & very underwhelming. I had the Key West Chicken & Shrimp with mashed potatoes & green beans.... the chicken was tough & dry, the shrimp & potatoes were decent, the green beans not only looked gross but also tasted like the can they came out of. Our server also had a table beside us and they were more angry with him than my boyfriend and I and we had been there longer. Only paid for our flavored teas & croissants. Overall VERY POOR experience. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food! For a great price very clean I will be back to try more items the ribs and shrimp are great  also try the cheese Kurds"}
{"text":"First time there last week...the food was average at best. The prices are not bad for the quality. Was seated in the bar area, which isn't very relaxing. The service was very spotty! We had to ask for more drinks, etc. The decor of the restaurant far exceeds the quality of the food. On the lines of a Applebees as far as the food is concerned. Nothing to rave about, and not worth a repeat \"dinning experience'."}
{"text":"Cheddar's is OKAY. I'm glad to have finally tried this place from the wonder of the occasional drive-by. Is it a cheese place?! Not really. It is your classic American restaurant. But I didn't leave with a super happy and satisfied stomach. I came with a party of about 20 and was initially told it would take about 1.5 hours to seat us but they managed to accommodate us on their patio seating within 30 minutes. Kudos to them! It was greatly appreciated. However, the menu wasn't very exciting. I had a hard time choosing what to order and not because everything sounded really good but because nothing really stood out to me. You have your typical appetizers, salads, pastas, and dinners categorized by protein. I went with the grilled chicken alfredo pasta with vegetables and it was alright. Not too flavorful. I had to hold back from adding salt. My boyfriend went with the ribeye steak with broccoli and mac & cheese which I tried and it wasn't bad at all. The mac & cheese was my favorite, nice and creamy. I tried the Cajun pasta as well and it had the flavor I was looking far. For dessert I had the giant cookie and it was giant, served on like a huge spoon! It was a little over-baked for my taste, I didn't enjoy it as much as I would have liked. I had the pleasure of trying their croissant bread pudding though and it was excellent. All in all I have mixed feelings about this place. Would I come back here? Probably not. But it was a pleasant experience with friends. Staff was attentive and food came out in a reasonable amount of time considering our large party. Some bad choices on my part but I would like that what I think sounds good to be great. Does that make sense?"}
{"text":"Came here because a colleague recommended it.

Service was fine at the bar top, but food was absolutely awful. This is honestly some of the worst food we've ever had. We definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Good Food and Good Service

Easter Sunday and we decide to go out for Brunch. Normally this would not be an issue since that is our customary routine but with Hip Surgery, less than two weeks ago, still playing it by ear.

Pulled in about 11:45 am just ahead of the Church rush. My wife dropped me off at the front door while she found a parking spot. I made it to the top of the steps on crutches when the manager ran out to hold the doors for me (both sets) which helped they were quite heavy.  They went ahead and seated me while we waited for my wife.

Nice decor and with the horizontal ceiling fans, reminds me of the old Bombay Bicycle Club Chain of restaurants from years past.

Wife joined me and our server was there to take our drink menu's and to present us with menus.

Both of us ordered Sweet Tea although I ordered it 1/2 and 1/2 and glad I did. Hate to think how it would have tasted if it were straight Sweetened Tea.

Nice menu with something for everyone.

I ordered the Country Fried Steak with Mashed Potatoes, Gravy and Cheesy Broccoli Casserole for my entree.  My wife ordered a Philly Cheese Steak with a side of corn for her's.

While we waited, we had a chance to observer the dining room. Nice and light and airy with a Deep South Atmosphere. I loved the aquarium at one end but so did most of the kids who came it as well.

Lunch came out in short order.  Server apologized because when they came in that morning, the kitchen had made to wrong gravy and I was going to have to wait for a few. No problem and when it came it was good. The Broccoli Casserole was somewhat dry though.

The Country Fried Steak and the Potatoes were excellent and let's face it, they are the highlight of the meal.

My wife enjoyed her Philly Cheese Steak but I will admit, I am used to a Philly Cheese Steak being bright yellow because of the type cheese used.

Nevertheless, she enjoyed it and portions were large enough, she finished it off this evening.

Came time to leave and everyone was grabbing and holding doors again. I'm not helpless but the gesture was appreciated and it extended beyond the staff. Other Patrons were trying to help as well.

Great commentary on the Spirit of Easter"}
{"text":"This is my second time here, and the service was much slower. It took FOREVER for our orders to arrive at the table, and the lady who served it to us talked just as slow.

I had the Fish Tacos ($8.19). There are two options for the cook, grilled or fried. The 2 flour tortillas also included roasted corn slaw and Cajun tartar sauce. It comes with french fries, which may be substituted for any other side. I requested my fish to be grilled, and it was so light and delicious! The slaw and sauce were mildly spicy, just how I like it. They were very skimpy on the fries though. The fish was definitely the star of the dish, but it was not worth waiting so long."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each time I've had great service. The food is pretty good, I would have given the place 5 stars but I ordered a burger and asked for it medium rare and the server mentioned they don't temp their burgers so it may be closer to well done. Other than that the place is lively, food is good and service is great!"}
{"text":"The moral of the story here is understand where you're going and anticipate what they do well... 

My wife and I have been here three times and all three have been very consistent... really good service (three different servers), HUGE portions, great prices, good place for family, quality food. 

I'll say that each time we've ordered pretty basic stuff: the pot pie, a couple wraps, some chicken tenders, etc. All very good and mostly better than I expected. The pot pie was a bit bland, but quality stuff inside so it doesn't taste like a frozen box top, like many other restaurant pot pies. 

An example of some awesomeness: for $8.95 you can get a \"three course\" lunch with soup, salad and entree-type item. My wife took at least 1/2 of it home and it was great later. 

From what I can tell, though, they only have a couple tables to seat 8+ people... so you're going to wait if you bring a party. 

I'll continue to go here (when the line isn't out the door) and bring even my pickiest friends because the menu is so varied and the quality is high."}
{"text":"We had dinner this evening at Cheddar's in Chandler. As many other reviews have stated, the restaurant is attractive and welcoming. The staff was friendly and helpful. Our server was Nayeli. The service was prompt and attentive. Tthe food was all excellent and surprisingly affordably priced.

Here is what made our experience stand out. My wife ordered the ribs, but found that the sauce was too tangy/spicy for her taste. There was not a thing wrong with them, just a matter of taste. Our server graciously brought her a menu to pick something else. The manager also came by the table to make sure that we were taken care of.
This was all so nicely done, very classy. We will be sure to recommend Cheddar's."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed. The food was pretty bland. Our server didn't want to be there and seemed annoyed that we were on the patio even though it was nice out, the hostess recommended it, and there were plenty of people seated out there. The misters were on and were drenching us. They went off and on a few times. I'm sure different guests were asking for them on or off. It just wasn't a good experience all around."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. 

Let's start off with the things I like. 

Their food is pretty good. The broccoli and cheese casserole is a must have and they have a delicious side salad that comes with a honey croissant and it's TDF!

Another thing I like about cheddars is the price range. $7-$15. That's pretty affordable for the college scene. 

Let's talk about the wait staff. 

I feel as if when Cheddars hires their servers, they try to hire the worst ones in the Charlotte area. I've been to this establishment 8+ times and I have yet to have good service. The only reason I keep coming back is for the Afro mentioned. 

The service is so bad it's frustrating to no end. 

Drinks are always empty, appetizers never make it to the table, orders always come out incorrect and you usually get an attitude. The list of terrible things could really go one but I don't have time for that. 

I'll probably give this place another chance and then I'm done. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"We finally got to try this Cheddars last night. We had been to one in Florida 11 years ago and really enjoyed it. We went on a Saturday evening around 7, and had about a 30 minute wait which isn't bad at all.

Nice looking, well decorated, dimly lit restaurant. We were seated in a nice booth by the window in the bar area, which was a bonus as we could watch the Olympics while we waited. Our waitress was nice and did a good job with our orders and keeping our drinks well stocked. The food itself was good, plenty of selection and reasonable prices. Although we didn't order a cocktail, they looked good and were a great deal. $5.49 for a mango and berry margarita? And it was big! Looked great!

The reason I am knocking off several stars is because during the course of waiting for our food to arrive, a tiny black ant crawled across my forearm at the table. Hmm, no biggie, it's AZ, bugs happen. I killed it and didn't think much of it. Then I noticed he had friends, about 8-10 of them all together crawling across our table. Seemed to be coming in from the window, as there were none under the table. 
I told our waitress, who was bringing our food right then. Didn't make a big deal out of it, my husband used the light on his iPhone to show her the ants, and we discreetly asked to be moved to the high top table in the bar near us. No need to cause a commotion or upset any other diners. Not a huge deal, but seriously, ants on our table? Not something you'd enjoy at a nice dinner out.
So, after getting approval from the server working the bar, she agreed to move us. We moved, got our food and enjoyed it for the most part.

My real concern is that the manager never came by, and the server never apologized for the situation. Nothing, not a word. Our dirty dishes sat on that table most of our meal, then a bus boy came and cleared the table, and reset it for the next guests. Yuck! Really? You're going to reseat that table with ants on it?
I asked the waitress when she brought our bill if she'd mentioned it to the manager. She started to say \"I will tell him\", then when I said \"I thought he'd come by\", she said \"oh, I told him, he should be by soon\". We sat and waited a while longer, and nothing. No apology, no visit, nada. So, we left.

Very disappointing. I expected more from this restaurant and wanted to like it here. Sadly, the lack of care will lead us to never return and not recommend to our friends. Bugs crawling on your table is just unacceptable and I'm shocked the server and manager don't agree."}
{"text":"This was a great meal for the price! My husband and I stopped in for an early dinner on a Saturday and were seated right away. The service was great and the food was tasty. My husband had the 8 oz sirloin, medium...it was cooked perfectly. I had the lemon pepper chicken, which was also cooked to perfection (I hate paying for dry chicken at a restaurant!). Both of our sides (mashed potatoes, broccoli cheddar casserole, and steamed broccoli) were nothing mind blowing, but still tasty. I couldn't resist the strawberry swirl margarita at only $3.99, it was massive and delicious. The interior is nice and warm. Overall a great first impression, especially when we received the bill! This place is an awesome value."}
{"text":"Hostess was friendly and seated us quick. We sat in the bar area in a booth. Once seated it took 7min for our waiter to take our order.  Other than that the waiter we had was good his name was Randy.  Ordered country fried steak when it came out it was red inside. It took them about 15 min to correct it and the second time they made sure it was done all the way. My wife ordered the New Orleans pasta and had no complaint. Dessert was a nice size.  Strawberry tea is good but not worth  3.00. Love the honey butter croissants they are yummy. We had to get an extra order to go.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"After discovering cheddars on a vacation in fort Meyers Florida, I was thrilled to find it my area of chandler, Arizona. I have been three times and find the quality and price of my meals outstanding. Presentation and service has been fantastic. The warm croissants with drizzle of honey butter brought to the table are delicious. Their special version of the painkiller cocktail is hard to beat. Love it as a casual dinner out."}
{"text":"I love this place, its an affordable steak house. I've been here three times now and both the chicken and steak is delicious every time."}
{"text":"Bartenders are the best. Now Idk how much you have to go to be a regular lol but I go couple times out the month which is nice to know the min you walk in the Bartenders already know your face and what you order. Great pace for food and drinks especially during lunch hours when it can get busy."}
{"text":"Cheddars has an absolutely FANTASTIC atmosphere. Lighting is always great, noise level is moderate. It's a great place to go on a semi-formal dinner, without dumb prices. The seating is plentiful and the tables are big. 

Also, the croissants are ambrosia (God Food), just so you know. So order 12 and you should be set. Be weary of the red beans and rice, it's a little too watery for my taste. 

I come here all the time with my family or with friends, it's a great place to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"I have been to Cheddars a handful of times.  I always order the steak and chicken strips and they are usually pretty good except the last two times when they gave me RAW chicken strips. 

The first time, I thought it was somehow by mistake, but then it happened a second time and now I will NEVER go back! Oh and the last time we went not only did they give me raw chicken strips, my aunt also ordered chicken and instead they gave her fish. Get it right people!!"}
{"text":"When we saw the inside we thought \"oh no... Another overpriced restaurant with OK food\" but the prices AND the food were outstanding! I loved this place! It's so chic and very clean place and the prices are awesome!"}
{"text":"I first ate at this restaurant in 2016 and it was a wonderful experience. The atmosphere was pleasant, the food was very good, the staff was friendly and service was timely. While it was a bit of a drive for us, we enjoyed the place enough to make the extra travel time worth it.
Fast forward to our visit there this past week though...I don't know what's happened but the place has really gone down hill. First off, the place was filthy. Stuff left on floors, food stuck on booth walls and the restroom, omg..the toilet seat had obvious prolonged accumulation of dried urine stuck on it..yuck.
The hostess was pleasant and we were seated promptly but the waitress was cold, indifferent and slow. The food was mediocre at best...the soup was room temperature, the salmon was bland to the point of being almost tasteless and their famous croissants were overbaked on the outside and undercooked/doughy on the inside. The tea was weak with a hint of staleness.
How sad that this place has been allowed to deteriorate to such a degree...we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Very inviting atmosphere and fresh well prepared food. This was my first time at Cheddars but I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The service here was great, and food was even better. The spinach dip had a great flavor and after you finish it off they will still bring you more chips and salsa. They have a large menu with a lot of great choices, the only issue I had was that the size of the tables in the center dining area where a little small for 4 people."}
{"text":"This place used to me mine and my boyfriend's go to date spot for lunch, which is why I'm being modest and giving three stars and not one! But our most recent visit was less than satisfactory. It took around 15 minutes before someone even asked for our drink. The waitress said she was about to get off but since our original waiter was so busy, she would take our table. First I thought that was really nice and then I could easily see she regretted her decision and wanted to leave lol. Our original waiter came up asking for our drink order and we explained we had already been helped. Anyways so then it took about 10 more minutes to receive our drinks, we just got waters and one soda. Then it came time to order the food. We got onions rings, chicken pot pie, chicken tenders, and spasagna with meat sauce. Never had it with meat sauce so I figured I would try something new, along with the chicken pot pie. Normally they have the best onions rings and chicken strips. After waiting 45 minutes for our food, it was not tasty at all :( the chicken pot pie I could barely eat. The chicken in it was so disgusting and unseasoned. The onions rings were literally dripping with grease and they usually don't! The spasagna itself was okay, but their meat sauce was not good at all. Plus it was still frozen on some parts. Yeah, like, biting into a tomato and meat ice pop D: so that made the spasagna cold. I always thought they made the sauces daily, not kept them frozen. The chicken strips were lacking, too, so I was so heart broken. I loved this place so much :( I'm hoping that my next visit will be much better, and I can update this review."}
{"text":"My family is obsessed with Cheddar's, and for the price the food is pretty good! It's classic southern comfort meals that are all made from scratch, and the portions are huge. 

Weekends are super busy but they don't do reservations, so first come first serve. If you want though my husband and I go on weekday nights when it's not nearly as crowded, and our servers can spend more time at our table. Although we've never had a bad server busy or not. 

The food we have tried so far is an extensive list. All of it good. I personally think the cheese curds are a must, croissants are worth ordering right when you sit down, and you get a coupon for their queso if you sign up for emails! My husband adores the onion rings and for like $6 you get enough to feed 4 people easily. 

As for meals, anything seafood I get and love. Husband has thoroughly enjoyed the ribs and honey Dijon chicken. But if you don't get full off of appetizers and meals alone, the dessert will leave you rolling out the door. Chocolate cake is gigantic in size and flavor. Highly recommend. 

Overall, restaurant has always been clean and food has come out quickly. It's not your 5-star gourmet super fancy dinner joint, although the food is always perfect for the price and servers will be accommodating. My family and I will continue to come here and enjoy Cheddar's when we can!"}
{"text":"All together Cheddar's is a nice place to go for a moderately priced meal. Their spinach dip and chips are amazing and I enjoyed their sirloin steak as well. However, I was a little disappointed in their wine selection. They had very low end wines (the kind you buy for a casual dinner night at home, $6-$9 in store) for about $20+ for the bottle."}
{"text":"I've been going to Cheddar's for years and it has always been on point! An absolute must are the honey butter croissants! You will be hooked aftert he 1st bite! Trust me. You don't want to pass these up.

Also if you're looking for a tasty adult beverage you definitely should try the Pain Killer. It's pineapple coconut rum goodness! There's also a two pain killer max so you will feel a little warm while partaking ;)

Now on to the food...EVERYTHING I have ever ordered has always been good. I would highly recommend the ribs and shrimp, spasagna, cheese sticks, tilapia, tortilla soup, chicken Alfredo and what I like to call the Cookie Monster! Sooooooo good! 
This place is total comfort. If you're looking for a delicious filling meal this place is it 
I will say it's a little on the loud side because it's always packed because the food is THAT good! but once you get situated you hardly notice. Or just order the pain killer and croissants and you definitely won't notice. 

P.S. If you are a ranch dressing lover like myself this place has some of the best I've had!!! Seriously. I don't play about my ranch."}
{"text":"Good service, Always good food.  that's why we keep coming back! Have tried multiple items and have n bet been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Service was awful. Waited 20-30 minutes on our drinks, waited an hour and a half on our food which was cold when it came out. It wasn't busy at all. One of our guests didn't even receive all of their meal. We had to ask 3 different times for straws and twice for extra napkins. The manager gave us a discount on our meal but never came out to speak with us and no one ever apologized for the time we waited for our food. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"My family went to the one in Colorado Springs CO and raved about how good it was.  On our way home from Phoenix we decided to stop by and give it a try.  My family still loved it, but I only found it just OK.  My daughter and I had the Monte Cristo sandwich.  The insides of the sandwich was good, but the fried dough outer shell was a bit greasy and not very good tasting.  My daughter still loves it.  My wife enjoyed her bacon burger, mostly because the bacon was really thick, especially in these days where most bacon in burgers and sandwiches are so thin that you can read through it.  My other daughter go the Philly Cheese Steak.  She ordered it w/o mushrooms and it came with mushrooms.  They quickly changed it which surprised me.  We had their famous Skillet Cookie Sunday was just OK.  The chocolate chip cookie was very bland and the there was not much flavor to the hot fudge sauce."}
{"text":"GO TO JIMMY JOHNS ACROSS THE STREET, YOU WILL GET WAY BETTER SERVICE THAN YOU WOULD HERE! Litteraly the WORST service I've ever had! My family and I came here after my nephew's Christmas program. There was a total of 8 of us (5 adults and 3 kids). When we first got there we were told the wait would be 25-35 minutes. No biggie, we waited. After about 45 minutes (and numerous other parties sat before us whom arrived after us) I asked how much longer. He told me they were wiping of the table and would be seating us next. After another 10 minutes, I asked again, he assured me very soon. After another 15 minutes (mind you it had been over and hour, and the 3 kids were getting VERY restless in the waiting area), I asked to speak with the manager. When she finally came over, she explained how the kitchen was backed up and they couldn't seat anyone. I told her we had been waiting for over double the amount of time we were originally told, and other people were sat before us who arrived after us. I basically had to beg her to sit us so that at least the kids would be out of the way and could get their food. Honestly we would have just left if we hadn't already waited SO LONG. She finally agreed to seat us, and mentioned she would send some appetizers to the table. Our waitress was ok. You could tell she was upset that she got a table that was already unhappy, but it wasn't her fault. And no one took that out on her. She took our drink orders, and the kid's food orders. When she came back to take the adult's orders I mentioned that the manager said she would send some appetizers out. She knew nothing about this. I said just forget it, and we ordered. 3 of us had side salads we asked to have before our food, and my husband did order an appetizer of cheese balls (I think). We had to remind her 2 times about the salads. When our food came out, we still hadn't received my husband's appetizer. I asked about it , and she nonchalantly said she forgot, but would put them in. We told her not to worry about it at this point. Our drinks were maybe refilled 2 times (sat empty for most of the meal). Even though we told her to cancel the appetizer , it still came out after we were all eating. She said she wouldn't charge us for it (IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FREE ANYWAY), but whatever. Finally we get the check..... now let me just say this, we in no way came here expecting ANYTHING for free or discounted, however you would think after ALLLLL OF THAT they would have given us at least 10% off, or free sweet teas.. SOMETHING. NOPE!! Not only that, but they even charged us the extra .50 for the cheese on my husband's burger. I mean COME ON. GET IT TOGETHER CHEDDARS AND LEARN SOME CUSTOMER SERVICE! We usually go to the Cheddars in university, and I've NEVER been disappointed. Even the food at this Cheddars was subpar at best. SERIOUSLY SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY,GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place out after hearing such great things about it and was so disappointed when we had such bad service. We sat for about 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged us. Another server asked if we had been helped and when we said no she let us know that she didn't think our server knew that we were her table. She went ahead and got our orders. We then received our food before we even got our drinks. I'm giving two stars only because the food was good. Service just sucks! Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"The service was okay but the food tasted like it was all microwaved. The Mac n cheese was very watery and the fries were way over salted. Was very disappointed."}
{"text":"Did not care for what so ever...
Shrimp was way over cooked.
Caesar Salad had a roll on it off to the side with very sweet honey butter  and the butter was drizzled across my salad,did not like at all ruined my salad.
Dry burger with nothing as in catchup mustard mayonnaise, would be a good burger if they seasoned it but nothing on it even salt-and-pepper something would had been nice.they look like they are hand pressed was juicy.
Actually very nice looking place,clean,service was good.. they have a lunch menu. could use some healthier less heavy choices in the appetizers"}
{"text":"Cheddar's is usually one of our favorite stops in Gastonia but not this time.  We received our spinach dip and had enough time to eat over half before ever ever receiving our drinks (ice water).  

My wife ordered a buffalo chicken wrap with extra buffalo sauce.  It came out with buffalo sauce only  on the side.  My daughter and I had enough time to completely eat our meal before the server came back so we could let him know.

He then took her food back and squirted a little buffalo sauce back on one side of the tortilla and brought it back out and said it was \"too late\" to toss the chicken in the sauce like they  were supposed to.

I told the server they could throw it out.  Most restaurants would make a new meal when there is a problem with the food.  I'm still sitting on their restaurant and a manager still hasn't came to speak to us."}
{"text":"I was in town on business and really like cheddars last time I was in town so I wanted to check this one out. 

I was not disappointed. 

I got the Maui margarita which was just really good. I really liked that it has lines inside of it. And it also had a shot on the side.

As an app we got the trio with chicken strips, cheese bites and potato skins. Everything was really cooked well. 

I got the Salmon dinner plate, now I know the salmon wasn't fresh off the boat but it was still pretty good. 

Next time I'm in town I'll be back !"}
{"text":"My friend and I arrived right when they opened at 11am on a Weds and by the time we left an hour later, the place was pretty much full and the parking lot was jam-packed. This is a Texas chain which claims that all food is prepared fresh and seems to focus on the American standard menu. The decor is stone and dark wood with booths, tables and chairs, and a very nice bar area. There are also some tables outside. Everything looked super clean.

We were seated immediately and our server was prompt and attentive. I had the $6.49 lunch special and selected the Monte Cristo sandwich with a raspberry sauce for dipping and loaded baked potato. The sandwich was wrapped in a golden fried batter with powdered sugar on top. The batter was reminiscent of doughnut dough. I though this was odd at first but the more I ate of it the better I liked it.

My friend had a strawberry lemonade ($2.99) and the veggie platter ($7.99). The servings sizes were more than enough for lunch (I took home half my sandwich). The food was tasty. 

I highly recommend this restaurant and plan on returning to try the Bourbon salmon! I also would like to try the broccoli casserole."}
{"text":"I have been there 4 time.  Each time the servers are terrific, fast and on-the-ball.  

The fried food is good because it's very crispy but never greasy. 

I have had the pasta, beer battered fish and chips and cheese bites.  All were delicious. 

My friend had crispy chicken tenders and he loved them. 

Always a great experience."}
{"text":"The decor here is extremely nice, up to date and super clean and as said by many others I had high expectations for the food. I agree the quality is no different than if you were to go to chilis or Applebee's. Nothing to rave about. I was disappointed. 
Our waitress was super nice, it was about 4pm on a Monday so seating was immediate. I was disappointed that there were a group of employees sitting at a table across the way chit chatting in a large group I'm guessing due to the lack of customers at that time of day but it gave an unprofessional feel. 
I ordered the Cajun pasta, again nothing to rave about, and I didn't much care for the sauce. The garlic bread was ok but tasted like the same ones I get from the store, Texas garlic toast in the freezer section. And they charged extra when I asked for an extra piece of toast, which I found silly due to the pricing. 
My husband ordered the steak with mashed potatoes and broccoli, the steak was decent, I liked it better than my pasta and the sides were bland. 
I expected more. We will try it again I'm sure in hopes of better food."}
{"text":"Really wanted to like this place. The decor is beautiful a nice staff but the food is horrible. Tried it three times and have been disappointed three times.  Will never go back"}
{"text":"Good baby back ribs not very sweet and has lots of meat.

Service is so so 

Croissant as good as charleston"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here practically every week. We love the food,and it is consistently good. We have had excellent servers and several servers who barely know the basics (offer a refill, check on the guests, offer a box for leftovers). Please tell your servers to show a little personality and not act like they can barely slow down to bring you whatever and can hardly wait to get away from the customers. I'm not talking about extended conversations. I'm talking about the ultra minimalists who take an order, usually without a smile. Who ask if everything is ok as they keep on walking. Who usually drop the bill, without a presenter, and who seem oblivious to obvious needs like boxes and drink refills. My final comment is about the badly ripped seat in the booth I was offered. Please don't ruin this beautiful restaurant with seats that cut into people's legs."}
{"text":"Great prices for our lunch  Menu had Good Variety to choose from and Drinks Really reasonable Margarita $5@ Sweet Tea Vodka $5  My salad $9 Hubby got Chicken Pot pie Big Caesar Salad @Crossiant $7.50. We'll be back!"}

This restaurant offers many delicious meals & varieties."}
{"text":"We had attempted to eat dinner there several times before but there was always a long wait. We decided to go there for lunch instead. We went there around noon and there was no wait. We even got to pick out where we wanted to sit. The food was good and fresh. Prices were reasonable and the staff was friendly. Overall, we'd visit again"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Great interior design. I loved our server Ana . She was sweet, funny, and had a great attitude. The food was amazing . Chicken tenders were delicious as were the baby back ribs. Mmmmm Mmm mm! When you go be sure to try to side of Mac and cheese ! Yummy!!"}
{"text":"4:50PM on a Sunday, parking was difficult.  We did get seated immediately.  Nice and colorful interior with unusual ceiling fans and a giant freshwater aquarium and lots of cozy booths.  It is a rather large restaurant and appeared clean.  This was our first visit.  The menu was nicely available online so we knew what we wanted.  My wife ordered a strawberry lemonade and our waiter said \"I'm sorry but we were out of fresh strawberries so I put a syrup in it, if it is OK with you?\"  It had a good taste, and I had ice water which was OK.  I ordered NEW BOURBON GLAZED PORK CHOP 10.99  10 oz. center-cut, bone-in pork
chop on a bed of mashed potatoes and topped with bourbon glaze and homemade onion rings.  It was served with one side, I chose coleslaw.
My wife had COUNTRY FRIED STEAK 9.99  Hand-breaded served with mashed potatoes, gravy, Southern green beans (we substituted Broccoli Cheese Casserole), Texas toast, and an order of Honey Butter Croissants, 3 for 2.99 which were very good, warm, flakey and gooey sweet!  Both our mashed potatoes were luke warm, the broccoli casserole was too and didn't have a good flavor.  The glaze on my chop was very good as were the small mound of onion rings.  The pork, however, was mostly tough and lukewarm as well.  The cole slaw was very good.  Overall I don't think it is worth returning to try something else."}
{"text":"cheddar's yelp page says \"closes at 10pm\"; but the girl that answered the phone told me at 9:27pm that I couldn't make an order for pick-up. Apparently, they stop taking orders 33mins before they close. Good to know they don't want my business."}
{"text":"Very comfortable seating, nice decor and clean environment. Lemon pepper chicken with seasoned rice and beans were perfect for my palate. Right amount of tangy lemon and pepper on my chicken which was tender and moist. Really impressed by this place. The prices were reasonable too. Had a great experience. Will be back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.

First observation:  no lunch specials/menu.  Not necessarily a bad thing, just an observation.  I often order from a lunch specials menu for price and portion size, plus those dishes often come out faster.

Service was good.  Our server was sufficiently attentive but not overbearing.  Food came out a little slowly.  Menu looked like a pretty typical \"casual dining\" place.

The food itself was good.  Was it anything really special?  No.  But it was good.  I had key lime chicken.  It was a tad dry, but with the pineapple pico that wasn't a problem.  My wife had the Cajun pasta.  It also was good.  The same sort of food you'd find at Chili's, Applebees, TGIFridays (are they still around?), and that sort of thing.  The interior/decor was a little more relaxed than most of those, however.  Not a lot of clutter or TVs, just a big aquarium.

I wouldn't make a point of going here, but I wouldn't avoid it either.  It was good, but not compelling."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Prices are reasonable and the bartender was the greatest!!
Plenty for leftovers too!
The fish tank is spectacular! You can see through to the dining room where they have one of the most beautiful ceiling fans I have ever seen. 
Definitely going to be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Taste of food good but temperature went from barely lukewarm to almost hot   Even baked potato tasted like barely warm. When did they cook it? Service good   Ok but not running back here"}
{"text":"If I would rate this a zero, I would! I went out to lunch with my family. The service from beginning to end was awful! Everyone who was working looked very upset and wasn't friendly what so ever! I'm vegetarian and ask the server to make sure the there was no meat anywhere near my food! My third bite there was meat inside! You must be joking.. I will never eat her again nor will i recommend this place to anyone. Wow."}
{"text":"First time here for our Nieces birthday.. Food was fantastic and our Server Cat was Awesome! Thank you Cat"}
{"text":"First time entering in Cheddar's it has a nice jungle like interior. The food was good and the service was okay. This restaurant is usually busy as I feel as if it's another Hops, but cheaper burgers and more of a hang out atmosphere.

One bad thing about this place is the amount of seating and how big of a group you can bring. They only have 2 big tables seated for 6+ and sometimes my friends and I have to split the tables.

I've been here many times with friends for lunch and dinner and it seems like every time the service is just mediocre. Understood though, that it has gotten better since the last time I was there.

I recommend the Mushroom Swiss Burger or the Chicken Pot Pie, both are my favorites. The pasta isn't that bad either."}
{"text":"It was at around 6pm on a Saturday and the three of us wanted dinner and after driving past it several times we decided to give Cheddar's a try.  The wait was 15 mins max.
 I decided to try the frozen strawberry margarita which was not the greatest.  We also ordered the fried mozerella bites with marinara and the kid got chicken strips with mac and cheese.  Must have been good cause she ate all but 1of the 3 chicken strips.  For dinner we got the fish & chips and chicken pot pie.  Decent and sufficiently delicious as well as affordale.  Reminded me of a nicer looking Black Eyed Pea restaurant which have all closed here in AZ. 
All in all a nice experience.  We will definitely be returning to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"This place is great and had so many options to choose from! They treat first time guests really well here! The onion rings were delicious, but definitely a lot for just two people. We got the chicken/rib combo and the key west chicken. Everything looked great and our server, Debbie was awesome! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location 10+ times, and I have never been disappointed!

I have explored and sampled something different most every time I've been; the Baked Spasagna with 1/2 Alfredo sauce 1/2 marinara, New Orleans Pasta, Smokehouse Burger, and the Broccoli & Cheese Casserole (side item) are all items that have stood out to me! My salmon loving friends are partial to Cheddar's salmon entree. 

Service has always been good. Never poor, but never stellar (which is fine by me). 

This is a great place to take your friends and family to eat! It's easy to get out the door for under $15 per person (drink, tax, and tip included)"}
{"text":"While I really do love the food here, I have to complain about the service. Every time I call to order food, it's quite the wait, but today I walked in (still on hold) to a bartender just standing there ignoring the phone. She said had no apology when I told her I had been waiting for over 10 minutes, which is rude in itself. This unfortunately is my experience almost every time I come here. 

As I said previously the food really is delicious especially for the price. Standard but good southern food, I love their fried chicken plate & steaks. The buttered corn is my favorite! And their drinks are great and HUGE as well. Almost all of the mixed cocktails are served in giant margarita fish bowl style glasses.

The service makes me shy away but the food keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"So came here based on reviews and was IMPRESSED.  

Had to wait 15-20 on a Sunday night, not bad.  Inside was nice, noise level acceptable. 

Waitress was friendly and great personality.  She was prompt and attentive. 

Menu was fairly varied, salads to sandwiches to steaks and ribs.   We tried potato skins (great combo of just right amount of potato, cheese, and bacon).   They were great. 

Caesar salad was near perfect, just the right amount of very tasty dressing. Plus it came with a sweetened croissants that was delightful. 

The main courses were Spaganzi (based cheese spaghetti) and a Monte Cristo sandwich.  The spaghetti was near perfect, fantastic tasters.  The Monte Cristo sandwich was OUT OF THIS WORLD.  My first one was 19 years ago, and no one else had ever been able to live up to that first sandwich, till today.  An absolutely perfect blend, cooked just right, just crunchy enough.  

We can't imagine how this  meal could have been better, AND the price was reasonable.   It was quite a treat, the best experience I can remember in years."}
{"text":"They have very good food here very nice service I will be returning soon as possible."}
{"text":"We've eaten here twice in the last 3 months, and enjoyed it. Broad menu selection, good quality food and service. Large portions at very reasonable prices. It is a nice atmosphere that works well for a lighthearted lunch or dinner out with friends."}
{"text":"The food was slightly above average.  Not bad for a chain.  Nothing special.  The restaurant was mostly full but no wait to sit.  Service was PAINFULLY slow.  So much so it pained me to leave a tip."}
{"text":"The Monte Cristo sandwich may have 69 fat grams.  I felt like I was eating a sandwich in a donut."}

The kitchen help doesn't seem to care"}
{"text":"I grew up going to Cheddars in Lexington, KY!  Their Club Sandwich, Monte Cristo, and Chicken Tenders will make even the unhappiest person happy again.

{"text":"well been here many times and today was the last.  

they have new menu with higher prices. why??? they were bought out by olive garden

my food usually comes with one side which are usually get the potato soup though i add on a side salad which was 1.49 now $3.49
are you kidding me?? i was like no way is this a steakhouse 5 star restaurant and no way will i pay $3.49 for a side salad. 
good luck cheddars you were doing well and sold it to olive garden which in return we the customers have to pay more than what the food is worth. 
your going to loose a lot of customers. so dont be greedy!!"}
{"text":"Worst Cheddar's I've ever been too!
The chicken tenders were soggy and cold.
Avoid coming to this Cheddar's if at all possible!"}
{"text":"Amazing! My steak was cooked perfectly and the service is top notch! Drinks are cheap and you really get a bang for your buck. Definitely in my top 10."}
{"text":"Had lunch today with a co -worker. We arrived at 11:50 and didn't leave until 1:30 due to poor service. We ordered an appetizer and after 20 minutes and several excuses from the server I had to get the manager who then expedited our appetizer. We did receive our salad in a timely manner but then the waiting game was on again as we waited for our soup and sandwich. After another 20 minute wait we told the waiter to just bring us the check as we were fed up with waiting. It was the worse restaurant experience I have had in many, many years. The manager did comp our meal and he was apologetic but I will not be going back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is good, not spectacular, but the ambiance for the price is nice, the prettier side of the restaurant is the North side, NOT the bar side (which is cramped and loud, not a deal breaker, but more of a sports bar feel noise wise). The restaurant is SUPER busy on the weekend's especially at night, be prepared for a long wait and a loud atmosphere. 

If you go when it is a little less busy, the environment feels nicer, noise just bounces of the ceiling in this place, they have no noise reduction I guess. 

Hard to have a nice conversation here without mildly shouting."}
{"text":"As many times as I've been to Cheddar's over the years, I can't believe I'm just now getting to writing a review.

If you must go to this place on a weekend, go early as possible, otherwise find a seat and get comfortable waiting. Although this advice is pointless on Sundays because it's pretty busy from open to close due to the church crowd. 

Personally, I don't find the food worth waiting no more than 15 minutes for. Also the service is nothing special.

Cheddar's offers all the typical American food: ribs, salads, burgers, chicken of all kinds, fish tacos,etc. My favorites are the honey croissants, bourbon glazed salmon, and the key west chicken and shrimp. 

It's a good place to grab a good, hot meal but nothing remarkable."}
{"text":"The service was good. Our waiter was very nice. I got the chicken & ribs combo. The chicken was good. The ribs weren't even eatable. It was so overcooked that the meat was crunchy. Literally the worst ribs I've ever had by a long shot. Other than that I've eaten at cheddars a lot and always enjoyed it."}
{"text":"After months and months of waiting for acknowledgment from Cheddar's about this issue, Cheddar's response is \"6/16/2016  Hi Carey, thank you for bringing this to our attention. We would like to have someone reach out to you personally, so please send us a private message with your contact information. Thank you.\"

First of all, send you a private message where? Secondly, what about the two previous private messages I sent using the FEEDBACK survey on the receipt and the email I sent directly using the CONTACT US form on your web-site? Both of which were ignored.

I'm right here. Feel free to say publicly what you want to say to me privately. No national franchise charges tax on a tip. Go eat at Red Lobster, Olive Garden, Texas Roadhouse, Applebee's, Chili's, Cheesecake Factory... literally anywhere in the country and see for yourself.

Financially penalizing your customers for leaving a gift to their server is INSANE and discourages a generous gift.

I hope you order a pizza some day and when the delivery driver brings it to your door and you tip the delivery driver $5, I hope the delivery driver says to you, \"Oh, if you're going to tip me $5, you have to give me $5.50 to cover the sales tax.\" I just want to see how outraged you are. Surely the simple solution is to take the $5 back and not leave any tip at all. I already pay tax on my income, I shouldn't have to pay tax on the servers income, too.

What is there to talk about? There is no precedent for this practice. There is no excuse for it. There is nothing to discuss. Change the deceitful and anti-consumer practice of charging tax on a tip. If and when you do, please let me know and I'll give you future business. Until then, I'm warning everyone I know to pay attention to the receipt they get at your establishment that literally NO OTHER NATIONAL FRANCHISE condones, practices or endorses.

Thank you. I look forward to your public response here."}
{"text":"It's been months since we were last here and had shitty service and unfortunately nothing has changed. Waited 10 minutes for someone to get our drink order yet the female manager cutting servers walked by 6 times and was too good to acknowledge us. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This was an awful mistake spending my money and time. We ordered catfish and a white fish platter was brought out. When requested a manager, the manager came out an questioned our ability of knowing catfish from white fish. Heather was the manager that spoke to us in a very condencing manner. WHAT....IM KEEPING YOU IN A JOB BY PATRONIZING YOU... Big mistake tonight Heather. My server was wonderful and gracious. ."}
{"text":"I would have written a review on the food if I could have gotten through to the bar on a TUESDAY.  2 times calling and being put on hold for over five minutes each is a bit much.  I even waited for the 5 minute mark to prove a point that no one was coming on the phone.  No problem, I'll order from somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant! The service was really good, the food was fantastic and the atmosphere was nicer than I expected, also the prices were perfect! My husband had the fish and chips and I had the fried shrimp with french fries and we were both pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was. My son like his grilled cheese too! They offer sweet tea but let me say, there is very little sweet in their tea. Despite that all was delicious and we look forward to going back to try some other stuff."}
{"text":"Cheddar's is a place my mom and grandmother like to go to. My brother used to like getting the Chipotle crispers! My mom and grandmother get the Dijon chicken meal. Sometimes my mom will bring that meal home for us to eat. I miss when the croissants were complimentary haha. Its pretty good food, though the decor does more for me than the dishes."}
{"text":"Got the Chicken Fried Steak. Came here on a whim because the Black Angus was closed for lunch. We enjoyed it for the most part. Food was fresh. Reminds me of Chilis. I would come again as quick decent dining. Food was nothing too special. Decor is updated and adult drinks prices are economical."}
{"text":"Good burgers but the \"sides\" are sized for babies... 2 bites and you're done.
Mac n cheese is blah. Nothing great there, I find the velveeta macaroni from the grocery store is better. 
The best thing was the Texas Sweet Tea.
Service is good.
Food mediocre. Same caliber as Red Robin."}
{"text":"DONT GO!!! Where to start... One of the poorest experience I have had in my life. We inform them that we were on our lunch hour , they took our order (after informing us that we couldn't place the order over the phone prior to our arrival ) after ignoring us for about five minutes the waitress followed us from the table to the bar, and took our order. She came back about three minutes later informed us that she had to transfer it to the bar staff, after 20 minutes we asked the bar staff
(Nick to be specific) where our order was, he informed us that he would go check and after returning seven minutes later we asked if we could get it to go( at this time we are now 35 minutes into our order/stay, still no water, no soup, no acknowledgment). We asked Nick if we could speak to the manager , who proceeded to take his time coming over, and another five minutes wasted, The manager Chuck McMalton made it to us, with no expression on his face just nodded and walked off after hearing her complaint. A few minutes later we received our order and our bills. I proceeded to take my food and walk to the front desk to request the manager again, at this time the bartender Nick proceeded to freak out thinking I was stealing his food and started talking smack about me to the rest of the patrons in the bar. The manager , finally made his way to me, now keep in mind we are 45 minutes into our lunch & this does not include our drive time, The manager proceeds to snatch aggressively the bag of food out of my hand and in for me I was still to pay for my beverage. This staff was so aggressively rude, inconsiderate, and unprofessional. Other customers and staff were highly shocked at their behavior towards us. They handed out more excuses as to why it wasn't their fault. The manager was 'suppose' to behave in a professional manner. Chuck literally snatched the bag of food out of my hand as if I was a criminal, all while maintained my composure and I was politely and quietly trying to express my concerns with his lack of ownership or empathy. Btw we were late arriving back to our employer by 20 minutes due to this fiasco and we never received any service nor hot food."}
{"text":"Service was super slow and a very interesting dynamic in seating unfolded.  I will be direct.  The place was busy but plenty of empty tables.  We are huge proponents of diversity and have no issue sitting with ANYONE ANYTIME.  basically we have never met a stranger.  I did however notice that we were escorted to the very farthest back corner of the restaurant.  We quickly noticed that we were seated next to a table of 7 and other another table of 4.  The interesting thing was ours and the other 2 tables comprised the only Caucasian folks in the place.  So basically we all got relegated to a corner.  I think if we are ever to heal as a society, these type if selective behaviors need to stop.  I think in our diverse culture, one has to look at a bigger picture.  I am choosing not to be victimized by it but instead bring it to the attention of management.  If we are not wanted here, we won't return.  Thanks for the clear signal.  I can't help but wonder, if our daughter, who is African American,  had been with us, would we have been seated differently?"}
{"text":"This is the second time I have dined at Cheddar's while on vacation in AZ. Great menu choices, reasonable priced and very good food. Both times the server I had was excellent. A must if you are in the Chandler area looking for a place to eat!"}
{"text":"What a cute place and such great food too! From chicken fried chicken to mac n cheese they've got all the favs for American food! I've had their ribs, baked potato soup, and chicken strips (on separate occasions) all were yummy and at a low cost! Portions are large so you get the most bang for your buck! Sometimes they bring out fresh hot cookies at the end of your meal just bcuz! Great place for lunch with a friend or a first date! Forgiving on the wallet big on service!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night for dinner with a group of 7, wait time was only 15 mins- bless! Soo we didn't realize that they took away their complimentary croissants anymore, whyyy chedders why!! :( (We still ordered 2 plates though, because their just THAT good!) I had the citrus salmon, surprisingly good flavors for a chain restaurant! I tried a couple of other dishes from everyone's plate, it was all okay. I agree with the other reviewers about the restaurant's potential, the prices are very reasonable for mediocre food (esp if you have big groups). But their menus were sticky & so were the floors, their sprite tasted like bland carbonated diet water? We were informed that they \"ran out\", so what was that drink that they gave us?? Overall I think the only thing I would come again for is for their mouthwatering croissants!(:"}
{"text":"Four solid stars. Last one missing because at times service can be slow. Hit or miss. 
As to the food. Great value - quantity and quality. I am picky and I will send food back. We are regulars here and only once I sent a steak back and they brought out a newly fresh grilled one. Not just heated the one sent back.  That right there is quality. 
Love this place. Chicken fingers are handmade. Croissant and cake. Cookie are sinful. 
8 ounce sirloin and 3-4 chicken fingers with two sides $14. And it's lean and good. (Example of good price for food)"}
{"text":"After several attempts of dine in and take out from Cheddar's, I'm still stuck with and A-okay rating. Sometimes the food is amazing and everything is on point and at times they take forever and the food is on the greasier or salty side. I understand that things happen, that there are off days but maybe I've just been going way too much on their bad days? I don't know. Service has always been accommodating though, specially when they have mistakes, so at least that. 

Food - depends on what you get. Did not enjoy the Chicken Pot Pie but I love the Chicken Tenders and their amazing mustard sauce. 

On drinks I've had their Painkiler and Texas Sweet Tea(with liquor) and both were just alright. 

Meh. That's my rating. Sure I'll eat here but I probably won't be craving for it."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to the Cheddars in El Paso,Texas 3 xs in our travels Always a pleasure the service and food Excellent!!And we were so happy to find a Cheddars in Chandler,Az as we now live in Mesa,Az,What a disappointment today as we went there for lunch. We were sat down promptly but it took forever for the waiter to finally come to our table. It wasn't crowded we evan asked the hostess if we could get service after sitting there fir some time she said and pointed to our waiter that was him  Instead of asking if she could get us something just water.When our server finally came over we ordered. We ordered the 8oz salmon abd didn't look like 8oz. We were so hungry we ate got our bill and left! It was a very disappointing experience. We won't be back there's too many other restaurants that value our business."}
{"text":"When this place first opened I have to say it was my favorite place to eat. Now it seems like the service has slowed down and gotten worse though. The last time I went there it seemed to take forever to get our drinks, then our food. I could have understood if they were really busy but they were not. Our server didn't seem to be very interested in checking in on us either which was really surprising because we usually have great service here. The server literally came to our table maybe three to four times total (to take our order, then bring drinks, then our food, then the check). Which don't get me wrong I do not like someone that seems to hover over you while you try to enjoy your meal and chat but we did not even get asked if we needed refills on our drinks until the server decided to bring our check. The food was also not hot when it finally arrived to our table which is really unusual service from this place. But other than that the food is good and pretty decent serving sizes for the money."}
{"text":"Yes a great place to come for lunch or dinner. As always my salad fresh and crispy. I had the chicken pot pie full of vegetables and chicken with a perfectly seasoned gravy. And for those that know me I am a big \"salter\". Not a drop needed for this!  We had the \"tower of onion rings\". See my picture with ranch and a spicy dip on the side. Anytime in Chandler I will be eating at Cheddars."}
{"text":"I've been told about this place so many times and how I have to try it.  Our server was pretty awesome, super nice, apparently half of my table have had her as a server before and says she's super consistent with great service, I'd believe it. She recommend for me to do the rib and chicken entree, and told me how delicious, tender and juicy all the meats were, so of course I had to get it.

Food came out and looked amazing! Went to cut into my rib, so I wouldn't be too barbaric, my knife wouldn't cut through the meat! 

Right on time, our server came by and I asked her if it was suppose to be like this,* tries penetrating the meat with my fork, wouldn't go through* \"oh wow, no that never happens,  let me take it back and get you a new one!\"
Manager comes over introduced himself and asked about our food,  as soon as I opened my mouth to tell him, his demeanor already started to change and didn't seem like he cared to even hear me out. My new plate came out and he asked me to cut into this one, it was a tad more tender, and I basically told him it was fine, I didn't want to waste more food. He apologized and left. 
As I cut into it some more and ate it,  the meat was extremely dry, like frost bite or overcooked in the microwave then dried out. Safe to say I wasn't going to eat that, just ate my chicken and sides then left.[ even took pix of my ribs to show my bf how not to ever cook our ribs at home]

They took half of my meal off and I paid the rest.
I might come back, but won't be ordering ribs.  Their chicken was yum though!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I both got ribs and mine were really spicy and hers were great. I have no idea why the sauces were different. I can't have spicy and would not have ordered. The mashed potatoes are great and the mac and cheese is okay. The corn is really delicious. The shrimp was really good. Unfortunately, the chicken fingers and ribs were so so. The ranch salad dressing was really good on the salad. The service left a lot to be desired. Our waitress had a bit of an attitude and we waited a good 10-15 minutes before she even took our drink order and acknowledged we were there."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try Cheddar's! I had high expectations based on the beautiful, high end finishes. Gorgeous stone and brick throughout, gas coach lights at the entry etc... the bathroom was awesome! Split face stone behind the vanity mirrors which are backlit with led lighting. You get the point, it was beautiful. I naturally expected beautiful food to go with it.

We sat at the bar and were fortunate enough to be helped by Charles who was seriously fantastic! Attentive, drinks were great, super friendly, simply wonderful service. He is probably the only reason we'd give it a second try. 

I ordered the Philly cheese steak which was super salty, greasy and basically inedible. The cheese wasn't even quite melted. The coleslaw tasted like it was straight from KFC and I haven't stepped foot in a KFC for like 10 years and I still remember being sick from it.

I really, really wanted to like it but I just couldn't. Amazing service at the bar 5 stars... food 2 stars. I may go back for a drink but that's about it. And not more than one, mind you, they were really good but also very pricy!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Service could have been a bit faster. Overall excellent experience. The broccoli casserole was awesome."}
{"text":"I have been to Cheddars a few times.  There menu seems kind of generic.  When I got my food it came with dirty silverware.  I asked for a different set and I get a slightly cleaner set.  The side of gravy I got for my mashed potatoes was so small.  It didn't even cover the top of my mashed potatoes.  When my family or friends go to cheddars I don't go or suggest to eat somewhere else.  There is absolutely nothing special about Cheddars."}
{"text":"I have been waiting YEARS for Cheddar's to make it's way to Arizona. I honestly didn't think it would ever happen but now that it's here, I'm in HEAVEN!! 

This location is prime, just on the other side of the 101 to Chandler Mall. Restaurant is extremely clean and looks amazing. You would think from the inside this is a fancy restaurant until you read the prices and think \"YES, good food that's actually affordable!\" Since this is a new restaurant, expect to wait unless of course you come at like 9:30PM on a weeknight. Service was friendly and efficient, even though it was busy when we came. We ordered an appetizer of chips and queso (adding meat is FREE). Delicious! I ordered the Chicken Caesar  pasta salad, which has been my go-to dish at Cheddar's ever since I've known about it. I think my favorite part of the meal is the unbelievably soft and buttery croissant that comes with the meal. I could eat an entire tray of those things. In fact, during this visit, I had 3 and they only charged me for 2. We didn't get dessert- too full honestly. My boyfriend had a few drinks as well and walked out of there for $40. 

Great value, food and service. I will keep coming back!!!"}
{"text":"I mean it is a chain focused on large portions of comfort food so know that going in. Even with low expectations the food was worse than expected and staff was clearly disinterested in their work."}
{"text":"Have to update in this place. the first several times were great then it started to go down down the tubes. The service has been horrible the last few times and the food was just fair so I think I'm done here."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Wednesday. The ambiance in very nice and comfortable. The food is typical American, a small step up in quality from your average Applebee's. The service was friendly and attentive. We stared with the queso dip, which was decent.  I ordered the Asian chicken salad and the boyfriend got the Tuscan chicken sandwich. The salad was very good, and a little different  with having mango and a touch of mint. The chicken sandwich was pretty average. Everything is very affordable, with entrees  around $10. The food is a solid 3 stars, service/atmosphere 4 stars, price value 4 stars."}
{"text":"Kelly the manger is absolutely wonderful! She attended to our table promptly and fixed the minor problem we had, we had a wonderful experience with the waitstaff and will be sure returning"}
{"text":"It was really busy. Our server was Kyle. Really good server. My ribeye was a little bit over done. But, it was still really good. Super great service, tasty food and great prices. One serious complaint though. They only have Tobasco. No Tapatió or any other hot sauce."}
{"text":"I went here today around 12P the food was decent but my server Thomas was not good to say the least. My mom ordered shrimp and wanted them sautéed in garlic butter. He told her we do not that. 1st off all if everything is cooked from scratch the chef should know how to sauté some shrimp or maybe the waiter didn't want to deal with a complicated order. I don't know. I was very unimpressed & I'm not a harsh critic at all but It was my moms friends birthday and she was even disappointed with the service because the lack of care and concern of the waiter. He didn't wanna do anything we asked of him. Omg. But because the manager walked up and greeted us personally I will give this 2 stars and the croissants with honey butter was to die for. But the service made this a 1 star visit along with Luke warm food. Only good things about my first visit is in the picture."}
{"text":"When I first saw the Cheddars had gone in at this location I assumed it was a nicer restaurant with higher prices. Then I looked on Yelp and read all the wonderful reviews and found out it was very reasonably priced so I decided to check it out. I finally got there and decided to splurge since it was my birthday week and order the steak dinner. It wasn't too big of a splurge because the steak dinner was only $10.79 before tax . That's a pretty darn good price for a steak dinner .

I only really dealt with two people, the girl who seated me and my waitress, but both were very pleasant and cheerful. I looked over the menu decided on a steak dinner, medium rare, with my two sides of mashed potatoes and green beans cooked with ham.   The food arrived expeditiously and the first thing I noticed was when I put the fork in the meat it slid right in showing me that the meat must be pretty tender. The knife also glided right through the meat so I was instantly impressed. I had been to the Outback 2 or 3 times in the previous months and got one of their steak specials and could not even get the fork to pierce the meat it was so tough. I also felt like a lumberjack trying to saw through the meat with the knife at the Outback and had determined not to go back . This surprised me because the theme of that restaurant its steaks. 

Back to the Cheddars steak, it was an 8 ounce compared to the 6 ounce at either Sizzler or Outback, was cooked perfectly, nice and red inside, and was incredibly tender and delicious. The potatoes were obviously homemade. The green beans were delicious.

I got back there a couple of other times before I left town. One time I got the whitefish and it was delicious.  I learned to like whitefish while I was in Michigan and although the Whitefish here is not quite as good as it was in Michigan it was still well worth getting. 

I was gone from the area for a couple of years and I looked forward to coming to Cheddars when I returned. My daughter and I came in here the other night and I got the whitefish again. It's still had wonderful flavor although the top was a little dried out which made it hard to cut through. You don't get a choice of vegetables now but what it came with, rice and a nice salad, was very good so that was okay. The price was still very reasonable. It looks like the steak prices might have gone up a bit since I was here before though. 

I'd still love to come back and try another one of their steaks and probably will soon. If we had a Cheddar's in San Diego I imagine I would patronize it often. The atmosphere is almost like that of a more expensive restaurant and the service has always been good. I definitely would recommend this place for others"}
{"text":"Delish -the food was so good .  The staff was very efficient and friendly. We will be going back soon. We were not in a hurry and the wait time for the food was well worth. We all had different meals and all parties were happy with the choices. We will be going back soon. Great food - very reasonable prices. Had the best potato soup of my life. Just saying"}
{"text":"So so. I've been twice now with my wife and both times it was just mediocre at best. I appreciate the \"from scratch\", but the taste and quality just didn't pop out. We gave it a second try, but not sure we'll be back. Just not very good food."}
{"text":"Updating to include non gluten free foods. Family likes it just not much to offer allergy friendly"}
{"text":"Check the shrimp before you eat it. Nearly chucked up what I'd already eaten when I realized they didn't de-vein and a big line of freshly bit into shrimp poo was staring at me. Other than that, everything else was good."}
{"text":"Never thought that I would leave a rating this low. This used to be one of my favorite places. I'm afraid now that I will never be back. I ordered a burger with sautéed mushrooms and crispy fried jalapeños. The burger was cold, the mushrooms were whole, and the jalapeños were cold and soggy. I flagged the waitress down and let her know about the problem. Knowing that this is a great place, I thought it would be taken care of. I received my plate back from the manager. Instead of a \"sorry this isn't up to your standards, and we will fix it,\" I received a \"this is why you are wrong\". Not good customer service at all. I ate it because at that point if the manager won't help, then you are just out of luck. Mistakes happen, I get that. When you are called out on it, fix the mistake. Don't try to prove to me why I am wrong and you are right."}
{"text":"Cheddar's has always been amazingly delicious with great service and great prices. You get a meal that is as good as home cooked, and priced just right for a family. They're chicken strips are amazingly yummy and not just for the kiddos! The onion rings are the best around too. You can't wrong with any of their adult beverages, and those too are a fraction of the price you'd pay at most bars...and much tastier too!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever!!!!
I've eaten here several times and the service has always been slow, but today I had to walk out and go somewhere else. The server took our order and then inform us the item we normally ordered could not be altered, even though it's never been an issue before. Even the manager came out and said no; with no apologies. After the request to speak to the manger we were forgotten by our waitress. We were there 20 mins and did not even receive the drinks we ordered. So I will never be back to this location again."}
{"text":"We've been there several times, food has always been amazing, service good, and at reasonable prices! The spinach dip is so good!"}
{"text":"1st visit and the food was so good. I had chicken strips and grilled shrimp my sides were black beans and mac n cheese. It was all scrumptious with healthy size portions. The cocktails were amazing. I definately plan on returning."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever recived. The food was good, but the service was so bad that I would not return."}
{"text":"The Honey Lime Dipping Sauce IS TO DIE FOR!!!! There are so many good things about this place, the price, the portions, the service, the wait time! First, the Price and Portion. I ordered the Lime Chicken and it came with two LARGE pieces of chicken, a side of steamed broccoli and a side of rice. I could only eat half and had to take the other half home. My husband ordered a steak with 2 sides and still had left overs to add to mine. When we got our bill, it was under $20 dollars for the two of us. 

We went on a Saturday night and the parking lot was packed, there were people gathered in the lobby area and many large groups. We put our name on the list and were told the wait was 20 minutes. We were set within 10 minutes and they had also seated the large groups and the majority of those waiting. Our waitress was very attentive and even offered suggestions for parring of our meals. When I asked for hot sauce of my chicken the waitress brought it back along with several other dipping sauces, just to try!!! The honey lime sauce was AMAZING! When we were packing up our leftovers the waitress brought out a separate to-go cup of the sauce so I could enjoy it with the rest of my meal! 

The only downside is the noise level and you feel like sometimes you have to yell to talk to the person across from you. This may have been attributed to the numerous birthday groups and other large groups though."}
{"text":"This is a nice casual cafe. It offers outdoor seating as well as table seats, large comfy booths. There is also seating at the bar. Friday is a very crowded night. My favorite is the Monte Cristo sandwich. I have a refreshing Bellini with it and brunch is heaven sent."}
{"text":"I've been disappointed with the restaurants in this area until today. Cheddar's exceeded all expectations of what a dining experience should entail. We were warmly greeted and seated right away. The restaurant has a great ambience and is tastefully decorated. The food options were impressive and affordable. The service was attentive and polite, even brought refills before the last sip was taken. The food was delicious and generously portioned. We'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"Cheddars is one of my favorites because you got great quality food for a great price and the serving sizes are large. The appetizer and food came out fast and hot but once the food came everything else took longer than we expected. The grilled shrimp and ribs were great and comes with two sides. To our surprise the grilled shrimp our served on a bed of rice so it was like getting a bonus side! You honestly can't come here without getting a order of croissants they are buttery deliciousness! 


After the food came we rarely saw our waitress and our drinks for the bar took a long time to come. We were practically done with our meals before the came. There was a long wait for to go boxes and normally if you ask for to go boxes the waitress would know you were ready for the check but we were left again waiting for a while for the check. It was a Friday night but it was around 9pm so the restaurant wasn't busy after all the kitchen was fast it was just the bar and service that wasn't. This is one of the few chains I really like so I'm sure I'll be back but I hope the experience is better."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch.  It was a nice environment.  They serve good comfort good that you are use to.  I had the chicken fried chicken, huge portions and tasted great.  The chicken did not loose it's crispy after smothered by the country sauce.  Mash potatoes and the corn on the cob was great too.   The server was good but we had to ask for new silverware due to they were dirty."}
{"text":"The redfish is to die for! Our server Mark was a cool and reverent server that kept our drinks full and was very attentive! Best trait was he was smooth and cool and timing was perfect without being bothersome! Thats a talent so few servers have today!!!! Smashed the meal and so did my cousin!!!! Bravo!!!!!"}
{"text":"1st time here. I had a great experience. Shawn my server was awesome. He was so nice and energetic. Plus he knew the menu and had some good recommendations. Thanks Shawn! 

The food came out fast and was super good. I can see why the place was so busy. I only had to wait 10 minutes which was fine. It gave me a chance to look over the menu. The menu has many different options to choose from. Plus they offer a \"lighter \" portion if you want to go that route. I had the Strawberry lemonade with actual strawberries in it. I would recommend that drink. For food I had the salmon with the bourbon glaze. It was so yummy. The sides were delicious too. I felt like I was eating at grandmas house.

{"text":"So the place is new which in chandler means busy, we tried 3 times to go the first two the wait was way to long. But as they say the third time is a charm we went on a Tuesday and were in relatively quickly my wife and I went with our one year old son and couldnt be happier the food was really good the decor was amazing and the customer servie was great. I got the chicken tenders and fried shrimp which was amazing also it all tasted fresh I did have an issue with the mashed potatoes which seemed like a puree but still had great flavor. My wife got the chicken pot pie which was amazing the crust was so flaky and delicious we also got the Wisconsin cheese bites which were very yummy. we ended the night with a choclate bread pudding which melted in our mouths!!

highly reccomended"}
{"text":"I had the tenders which I thought were great! It was not bad at all after looking at all the posts I was a little scared! I went to the kings kitchen which had the best post and I thought it was very bad! I will sure come back here!"}
{"text":"I placed my order on postmates and they picked it up and delivered it to me. It was still hot and very tasty. The baked potato was a little dried out like it was over cooked or something. The corn was a little to sweet but good, I guess if it was just plain butter corn off cob no sugar it would have been way better. The Mac & cheese was ok. The ribs was the best part of the whole meal. They were half rack BBQ dry rub ribs, and they were very yummy. Had a lot of flavor to them. They were very very tender, falling off the bone. This was my first meal from them and so far so good.  The price was about $12 and some change. I hope it's like this or better every time I go."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food and service I got here at Cheddars. It's like u roll the dice tho with getting a good waitress. I had one really good waitress one time her name was Ashley, she was great! The honey mustard isn't that great either :( other than that I enjoyed eating there!"}
{"text":"First time here, having dinner with my wife. Had a 20 minute wait. Checked out the bar area. Did not have to wait, both high and low tables can be taken. Very cool fish aquarium, several large screen LCDs. Watching the NBA playoffs. The lighting nice. Not to bright or dark, perfect.

First up, a tall glass of Blue Moon, $5.49, and a Margarita on the rocks (huge glass), $4,49. Yes, the price is good. They don't do happy hour pricing, makes sense I guess. We split the appetizer, Triple Threat Sampler, skins, fried curds, and chicken, $10.19. My favorite food for the whole meal came from this dish, the Wisconsin Cheese Bites. Better than Culver's. One reoccurring theme throughout the food we  had is the batter used, crisp, light, tasty, non-oily.

For dinner we split the Country Fried Steak, and sides. We choose the Broccoli Cheese Casserole and Mac/Cheese, $9.99. The steak was hugh, batter again perfectly fried. The gravy was ok, could of used more on the side. The steak was laid over the  Texas toast, which was okay. The Broccoli Casserole was very good, Mac and Cheese was okay. I guess I was expecting more flavor. For the price, no complaints.

Dessert, the seasonal Crisp A LA Mode. Vanilla ice cream, cinnamon, caramel sauce, apple crisp, $5.49. This dessert was huge and very good.

Went to the bathroom when I first got there, both paper towel holders had no paper towels. On my way out I mentioned it to Jason the restaurant manager, he said ok, and took care of it. Later on he stopped by our table and asked how everything was, I told him in so many words too good, and the price is a right. He was friendly, left and came back with some warm cookies, nice touch.Caitlyn our server was very friendly, helpful and there when we needed her. The food came out pretty quick for being busy. Our side dish was not correct,  she took care of it right away. 

For the ambiance, price, quality of food, and service, too good. We will be back."}
{"text":"Please YELP can we add another rating or two?? And this could be one of the two \" What are you thinking??? Dr Phil where are you?\" Or Gordon Ramsey  there is this place that I would like for you to try\" I would laugh for hours!!!!!!!

 Just thought I would add a update... after speaking to a few people in this corporation with many apologizes I was asked to return\" Against my better judgment\"   and was told that\" it would not be the same\" we are going to retrain everyone! After a few days of thought and the statement \" just let us know when your coming\" 
     I kept thinking why let them know that I am coming?For what special treatment? THAT WOULD BE A NO!  So they could really cook ? No AGAIN!  So, I thought I would call their bluff I called the Corporate guys( I think the owners of the franchise) and with a very short fuse I told them I was coming back .
      Just as I thought I was sent a message can you give us a \"little more time\" for what? Are they closing the restaurant to retrain? That would be a NO?  
       So ask your self this the next time you go into a restaurant or you like to gamble and go to Cheddars what did they cook? I always gauge a restaurants quality by the size of its Sysco or other Food company's  Monthly bill!! The hirer this is the less they cook! And if the value of the customer is any sign how they value the care they take with your meal then take 3 shots of Cabo and call me in the morning."}
{"text":"Visited for Sunday dinner, the wait was about 15 minutes for a table which was very reasonable with no reservations. Had a coupon for the free chicken tenders with entree which is one of our favorites aside from the queso for an appetizer. 

Ordered a Chicken BBQ Platter with a side of mac and cheese, loaded baked potato and upgraded the salad. The sauce on the chicken is spot on and the skin cooked to perfect crispness. The mac and cheese hit the spot and potato good too. Croissants are good but glad you only get one because they are decadent! Would like to see the option to get a side order of onion rings on entrees. We love onion rings, but the appetizer size is just too much to do with everything else. 

We tried out the new $4.99 sweet and spicy shrimp appetizer (we got an email advertising for it, but it's not on the menu) and it was well worth it. Shrimp were perfectly cooked and sauce was perfect. Unfortunately we didn't have room for the lettuce wraps that they also had. I hope the shrimp make it to a permanent menu offering. 

We ordered the sweetened mango iced tea, which was a little too sweet for my husband, but Travis was an excellent waiter and took care of us - adjusting the sweetness. The strawberry lemonade was delightful - love the little pieces of strawberries in there (also love that it is free refills). 

We made it to dessert and tried the hot fudge cake sundae, which is a must do at least once in your life. The cake is a monster, but don't worry you can take it home if you can't finish. This dessert is definitely for sharing. We actually ended up with a lot of leftovers, which is great because there certainly is value for what you pay for. Not only is the food good quality, they don't skimp on the meat, sauces are great, and prices are reasonable (even better when they run specials and coupons - do sign up for their email club). 

Our service Sunday was fantastic and Travis was one of the best waiters we have had in a long time; I hope we get him again. 

Decor is lovely and a nice place to dine. We will be back."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Good food for a good price. Usually get the chicken Alfredo with grilled or crispy chicken. Brother got the jalapeño burger and it looked good too. Server name was Jada. She was very busy but remained attentive. Brought me stuff I needed without me even having to ask. Usually busy no matter what time I go. Love their drinks as well and they give you big ones. And their honey croissants...omg! Lol. You have been forewarned. They are so darn addictive. It's in the cut but it's not hard to find. Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"If you are in the area you have to pop in here!  It is a bit risky to order an Asian Chicken Salad from a new place but the price was pretty cheap so I thought I would give it a shot.  YUM!  The chicken was tender and flavored delish - the lettuce was fresh and the dressing was light and not overhwelming.  We sat in the bar area and had awesome service (the local clientele is certainly great people watching!)  Will definitely be back - awesome prices and service."}
{"text":"I've been to this new location when they opened and decided to pay them another visit tonight. Upon arriving, I was greeted promptly by the hostess but never saw a waiter. I saw other tables around me getting service and saw the manager greeting other tables, but still I didn't get service. I was sitting right next to the POS and probably saw 6 different waiters, but none checked on me. I finally became tired of waiting and left. They really need to invest in service. I went next door to Outback and had my beer within 3 minutes and the appetizer within 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our service & the amount of time it took to receive food and drinks today at cheddars.. There were 8 of us, on a Monday....the restaurant was pretty dead- and plenty of staff working. This was our 2nd time dining here, we came last year for lunch the day after the race aNd had a great lunch. Not the case this year- our very forgetful server looked like she'd been partying the night before at the Coca Cola 600 (we looked pretty bad too!) and was just unfriendly, short, so unapologetic and not accommodating at all. One of us waited no lie 30 minutes on a bud light...because they had to \"refill it.\" She didn't clear any dishes during our hour and a half lunch- when a drink refill finally came she couldn't be bothered to remove the used glass. My Monte Cristo was warm but damn good! Burgers were dry and overcooked, plates were sloppy-certainly Not worth a 30 minute wait. Overall, the poor service left us with a negative attitude.."}
{"text":"I went to Cheddars with my family. We frequent this location often. We ordered the sampler appetizer, a specialty salad, and seafood dish. The food was actually very good. My major criticism was our server. We were seated immediately because it wasn't many people there. Unfortunately, once we were seated the fast service slowed down. 

My sister ordered a salad to come out before her entree. The salad is supposed to come with bread. Unfortunately, the bread didn't come out until the appetizer. Also, at the end of our meal our server was no where to be found to pay. We ended giving another server our check and money. As we were walking out we saw our server talking (flirting) with a guy at the bar area."}
{"text":"I saw that this place was opening up and decided to try it out with some co workers. Ordered the peach iced tea which was good and had the jalapeño burger. It was quite a large burger but overcooked in my opinion. Sadly they do not allow you to order the burgers medium. The fries were standard. 

I would say this place is ok to try once but not likely a place that will visit again."}
{"text":"Wow to the fish tank! Nice place for small or large groups. The Maui Margarita is a MUST ORDER with the shot of cactus liquor! Yummy! I could drink several!! 
I ordered the Baja Chicken and it was freshly made, served hot, the portion size was great, and the taste was better. For the amount of food you are served you'd expect a high bill at the end-nope not here! The prices are great! I was with a party of 6. We each ordered a margarita, we shared 1 appetizer, and each had a full dinner meal.and the bill was $121 usd!! That's a steal. Especially, since we left out with leftovers! I'd visit again when in AZ in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Katie was our server and very friendly,  I had the New Orleans pasta and it was good. I will come back again"}
{"text":"They're only getting one star because I liked what I ordered. My main complaint would be the customer service. We were seated really quick but then after that it went downhill. Our waitress seemed like she hated her job and acted like we were bothering her by just Being there. It took 30 minutes for her to get out order. She did not refill our drinks at all, we had to ask another waiter got refills as she was nowhere to be found. Food was good when it arrived but it took about 20 minutes after we finished our food to even get our bill. No check up or anything from her, we probably saw her 3 times the entire time and the only time she smiled was when she handed us the check. One of the worst customer service experience I have had and it makes me not want to go back there at all."}
{"text":"Tries this place out so we could use some gift cards. Loved the atmosphere as we came in. They have a beautiful fish tank behind the bar with a nice assortment of blue fish. Tried the spinach appetizer. Hot, gooey from the melted mozzarella melted on top and simply delish. Came with a salsa that was amazing. Wife got a burger with bacon and onion rings inside. I got the philly steak sandwich. Most time when you get the philly they use canned sliced mushrooms. Not here! Nice, fresh buttons split in half and sautéed perfectly. Server was exceptionally attentive. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is really good! We loved everything. These cheese bites to the burning salmon to the steak and ribs! The sweet tea needed more sweet but that is the only bad thing I can say.

Our waitress was really sweet and gave just enough attention without being overly.

We may come back tomorrow since we will be in the area all week!"}
{"text":"Excellent fish and chips and very nice decor!!!  Good service as well. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"Have been many times and everything is really good. My favorite is the monte cristo. My daughter (who is very picky) says the blackened redfish is the best fish she's ever had."}
{"text":"This area of Charlotte is lacking any decent establishments - say it ain't so, all I've had is mediocre at any of them in this area including Cheddars.  First my salad , then my dinner and I asked about my wine and was told that the bartender was still \"making \" it.  OMG, do any of the restaurants care about anything around here?  While the food is mediocre, at least Billy's offers great service.  Next time, I am just going to have to make a drive somewhere to find a decent meal with good service.  I know Charlotte has better to offer, don't you?  PS - the server just hollered at me from behind the register to see if I needed anything else.  Boy have things changed since I was in this business- and not in a good way"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice, the outdoor seating was cozy with lights and whatnot. Staff was friendly and food was decent. I got the fish and chips with broccoli cheese rice. The broccoli cheese rice was AMAZING! The fish was okay though, bland so that was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Love it! Monte Cristo sandwich is the bomb! Pasta was great too.... It's on my repeat venue!
Not too expensive more affordable than other places
Not a tea drinker but their mango tea was delish!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner on a Saturday night and had to wait for 15-20 min, which is to be expected on that day of the week.  We ordered the Chips and Queso and it was good, they could not make a good Vodka Collins, they tried 3 times, the 2nd time it had a bug in it!!  I ordered the Rack of Ribs and Chicken fingers and they were good, however my boyfriend's steak was very fatty and full of grizzle, he said there was more fat on that steak then the opening episode of The Biggest Looser!!!  His baked potato was undercooked.

The Service was good and they did remove the drink from our bill, but since the food was not up to par, we will not be back to this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Come here several times.  We sat in the bar this time. Server was rude and reminded us to check and not just sit at the bar. Even though the dining area was full of older people from an assisted living area.  Service ended up being OK.  But still was approached incorrectly"}
{"text":"Awesome place.. Love the staff and food!! If you're looking for good eats at a decent price this is the place.. Great place for business meetings or when you are treating"}
{"text":"Very good food. I tried the Cajun Alfredo and it was delicious. But the service was terrible! The main courses took about 30 minutes. But our waiter seemed very inexperienced and looked sort of confused. 

For dessert I ordered the personal pan cookie. I waited and waited for it to come to the table. Finally after waiting for an hour the manager came to my table and told us that they screwed up out dessert. 

So they had to cook another cookie which takes about 35 minutes. After waiting for an hour and a half for a cookie. The manager said he would pay the entire bill. 

I will most likely return again to try for a better experience."}
{"text":"This is such a late post, but drove 7hrs from Long Beach to Arizona for my bday because I wanted waffle House and AZ is the closest. While I was in town decided to give this place a try in the word of my honeys mom and my good friends who goes all time in Texas and Georgia. And I will say I was not disappointed. The food and service was so GREAT! The drinks are equally BOMB! Whenever your near one I recommend everyone to go."}
{"text":"Had a family outing on the first visit. Atmosphere and food were better than average. Our server was very nice and took care of all the table's needs. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Cozy place. Fast and friendly service. In a nice area of Charlotte. All of the food on the menu is priced very reasonably. You cannot go wrong with anything here. I was brought here by a friend because I am visiting town. I highly recommend this place if you like good food with a good variety to choose from as well. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Please note: I have never dined here. This story was in my Living Chandler group on FB. Because of it, you bet I will be coming and bringing my family.

Thank you Zack, for you kindness, empathy and willingness to take action. These are the things that matter. You've been noticed and it's made a difference."}
{"text":"Never seen so many old people in my life. If your visiting from the Midwest and can't test then you like it here. Otherwise don't bother. Food is tasteless and resturant takes too many cutbacks. No coasters no receipt jackets."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is slow. I've been twice for lunch , and enjoyed both meals. I work about 1.5 miles away, and was hoping to add Cheddars to our lunch rotation, but due to slow service (we went early at 11:15 to ensure we could be seated immediately, which we were) our lunch ended up being 75 minutes, and our waiter seemed new and did not share our sense of urgency, after we expressed it twice. Chuck, the manager, did come by our table twice to make sure we were ok, and apologized profusely that we were delayed. Just wish we could go back, but I don't think that's an option. 

Btw- the chicken tenders come in a quantity of SIX with two sides. Plenty to split with a friend. For $10. And they are delish!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here after hearing about how great the food was. The seating and overall atmosphere was great. Bathrooms were clean and managed (Sorry that is a big thing for me ). They weren't blasting any obnoxious music and seating was immediate. 
Let me say first the server we had Caitlyn was absolutely lovely and amazing. We ordered Queso with beef and chips for the appetizer and it was great. After looking over the menu I was pleased that they had a Monte Cristo sandwich. I have had them before at other places made a different way but I was up to trying a new version. I failed to read the whole description well as the sandwich was deep fried and was probably one of the greasiest and most unappetizing things I have ever tasted.  It really was bad. It tasted like fair food. The fries were good though. I tried the salmon that my hubby ordered and it was cooked very well. The mac and cheese was bland and just meh. I think that this is probably a good place to eat for those days that you don't feel like cooking and don't want to spend a lot of money at a fine dining spot. The menu wasn't really that mind blowing so I will maybe give it another try some time. Its chain restaurant food so bear that in mind when coming as with any big chain there are things that will taste mass produced and this place didn't seem any different. I will def come back to try that cookie dessert sometime. The table by us got one and it smelled divine."}
{"text":"A very wide selection of food, and a great atmosphere! The ribs were pretty good and very tasty!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and employees were nice and good price if you get Tyler he knows what he doing"}
{"text":"First time here and I really enjoyed it. Environment was nice and not too loud. Servers here are amazing. Always had our drinks topped off and had our orders perfectly. I had their bacon cheeseburger with fries and it was super good for the price. Burger was moist and the bacon was delicious. Fries were a little more on the salty side but other than that it was good. Will come again!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here 7 times in the past two months! We have tried almost everything on the menu except for some burgers and a few appetizers. My wife and kids love this place. I don't know why this place only has 3 1/2 stars. Staff is always friendly. Some appetizers come out within minutes of ordering them and always taste delicious. All the chicken dishes came out perfect and not dry. Every side dish is delicious and flavorful. I just had the ribs and was surprised how well they came out (better than Texas Roadhouse and Outback Steakhouse) meat falls off the bone and is not dry one bit. I recommend this place to everyone and have gotten nothing but good reviews back from friends that have eaten here. This ace never disappoints. Kudos to you cheddar's a for being such a well priced restaurant with amazing food. Thank you for all the great meals!"}
{"text":"Service wasn't the best and lacking. Food was amazing per usual at cheddars. I tried the chicken Alfredo for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu."}
{"text":"Good food, AMAZING prices and great drinks. Customer service was extremely slow, they switched waiters on us in the middle of the meal, failed to tell us and then got my order wrong :/"}
{"text":"Ever since we visited our favorite one in Nc, it's great to have found one here in AZ. Not in phoenix, sadly. Think of Cheddars as reasonably priced with something for everyone, but on a higher scale. It's an American bistro with good size portions and tasty food. Never ever skip the buttered croissants! Those are the best! My tip to you...."}
{"text":"This is tbe first time I have to give a restaurant 1 star. . NORMALLY I love this place. That is why we chose this place for my bfs bday. First it's Thursday night and they refused to push tables together so the whole party could sit together. The manager said it's again at corporate policy. Is it against corporate policy to make your customers Happy? I GUESS SO! So our group of 16 after waing 1 hr 10.min had to be separated.... one in a table and one set in a booth nearby but completely separated. Then we order. While Graylin our waiter tried his best we had a few dishes that had to be sent back one in which was never replaced(he assumed they didn't want it) Plus my steak tasted like the most fatty cartilidged top,sirloin ever, and was Dec not cooked to a medium.  I didn't send it back because we had been waiting for 2 hours for this disastrous dinner. Needless to say I'm contacting corporate and will not be back. Thank you Cheddars for making my large group of family members feel like more work then it was worth ... next time move 5 tables and let people who come together eat together ."}
{"text":"I've heard about this place for at least a year but I'm never in the area so never even considered stopping in.  As luck would have it, my girlfriend and I were headed that way this past weekend and I decided (last minute, crossing a minimum of 5 lines) to drop in!  I'm glad I did, they hype was indeed true.  I had heard the burgers were large and cheap (just like I like them!).  I can confirm on both points, the burger was large, juicy with plenty of flavor and for something like $6 I got the burger and a drink included.  Not bad if I do say so myself!  I'll be back Cheddar's!

Not a dig on the place, but be careful they will charge you extra for certain sides.  I was charged $2 for cole slaw...come on...sneaky devils!"}
{"text":"The place was cute, prices are good, food was decent . SERVICE WAS AWFUL ! The waitress was a ding dong, but she always had a smile on her face, it was hard to be mad. Would I go back ? NAH"}
{"text":"Simple yet delicious and the prices are really reasonable.  I just wish they offered more than two different soups.  We dine here often especially for lunch."}
{"text":"Have seen this place for a while....finally tried it for my moms birthday and we were thrilled. The wait for a Wednesday night was 20 minutes. Good sign right? Service was good, good was excellent. Will be back to try again super excited!"}
{"text":"Great décor and great service, but it all stops there for me and the wife.  We tried their onion rings, somewhat greasy yet had a nice flavor.

My wife ordered the burger medium well and I ordered grilled fish tacos.  The burger was a bit underdone but not too bad, yet as she was eating it started to taste mushy as if it had a bread filling in the burger...we have had better burgers at 5 Guys for half the price.

The burgers DO NOT come with fries, be aware of that.

My GRILLED fish taco turned out to be FRIED FISH STICKS and under cooked. (And they note their breaded fish tacos are hand breaded, I think not, they were obviously pre-packaged)

I cannot recommend this place for the food."}
{"text":"Really good down home cooking. Everything is really fresh & well made. Waiting for a table take a very long time but that is normal around this area. Inside the restaurant is nicely done with the interior design. The giant fish tank is very nice to look at."}
{"text":"Great prices, atmosphere and food. I had the steak and half rack of ribs. My wife had the chicken tenders."}
{"text":"So I'm sitting here with a large group of friends and it's just awkward watching someone in your party eat a side of their dinner. Also our waitress was non existent only showed up for drinks and refills then to bring food. That's all. The servers shouted our orders out so we'd have to tell me who had what. The waitress had a very strong lack of energy. And just really didn't seem like she enjoyed her job."}
{"text":"I had an amazing first experience at Cheddar's. The server was on her game and the food was incredible. I will be back in soon!"}
{"text":"Very bad/slow service. Servers were inattentive, and the hostess was rude. The food however, looks and tastes good. Very good value for the price."}
{"text":"Amazing as usual! 
Cheddars is the best place for great food at super reasonable prices.
5 Adults and 2 children ate for just a little over $100- With alcohol!
We went on a Friday evening and it was packed as usual. But the wait was not too bad. Staff was really fast and friendly. Inside is nicely decorated and modern. Huge fish tank in middle of restaraunt.
We started with the queso and chips. It was so good we ordered 2 orders. The chips were fresh, crisp, and light not greasy at all. We ordered the queso with ground beef, it was seasoned perfectly. It also comes with a mild salsa,also pretty good.
Ribs & Shrimp: Melt in your mouth ribs, crispy seasoned shrimp 
Philly Cheesesteak: Stuffed with tender meat and loads of cheese
Chicken Fingers: lightly fried, not too much batter, very juicy
Oh and the cocktails!!
Painkiller: Must Try! Creamy, and fruity you def dont taste any alcohol 
Sweet Tea: Sweet and lemony! Strong but good!
I hope that they expand more West! I would be a regular!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate there last week.  I ordered a salad and, much to my disgust, I found a hair in it.  The manager came by and assured me that everyone in the kitchen wore hair nets but he would \"take care of us\".  We had already ordered the Queso appetizer.  I had the pot pie with my \"hairy\" salad and my husband had the Key West Shrimp & Chicken.  

When the bill came, they had not taken anything off our bill.  I guess I assumed that, when you find something nasty in your food, it would be nice to at least take the appetizer off."}
{"text":"The first two visits were great. The third visit the food was smaller portions and not so good. Loved the potato soup the first 2 times but on the 3rd visit it was watery and salty.  We usually like the Monte Cristo and order half because it is usually large portions.  The last visit the Monte Cristo was about 1/3rd of a half and could hardly see it on the plate. The waiter said it depends who makes them.  That didn't make any sense. The consistency is not there and I think I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place the food doesn't taste as good as it use to do so me and my family stop eating here"}
{"text":"Great food great service our waitress sarah was super nice just made the overall experience a 5 star experience"}
{"text":"I would love to give it a better review considering how beautiful it is inside. But there's just been too many hiccups that bring this down. I came here on Sunday at 9:50pm and were told they were closed, and infact on that particular day they closed 'earlier than usual' (which is unfortunate since the hostess that answered that phone stated 11pm is when they closed and  the hours on the website also state 11pm). It seems like there's a lack of communication on somebodies end in regards to the correct timing.


 Anyways, onto the actual restaurant. Based off the decorating inside is what really carries this review to three stars. Nonetheless, I was excited to try this place that just came to Chandler. Me and my party of three came here and were welcomed by the managers promptly and told for us to enjoy our meal. We had our drink orders in and we had ordered the santa fe queso and onion rings for starters. The onion rings were rather good, but the queso was just a mess. It really tasted like the queso that I purchase from the store for my sporting events in my house. Everyone in my party ordered a variety of burgers(we're not very original). I chose the mac and cheese as a side, which I thought was also just okay. They were a bit cold, and to spend 2.49$ on a side I expected at least more than ~4 bites of mac and cheese. We waited quite a while for the burgers as well, but i'm just going to assume since this restaurant just opened that they've not used to this influx of customers on a weekday. The burger itself is very good, not the best, but for the price-- you can't beat it.

Food:  2/5 (I just wasn't impressed, honestly)
Interior: 5/5 (gorgeous)"}
{"text":"Great food, we always get chicken strips and shrimp. The honey croissant are delicious and of course the Cookie Monster."}
{"text":"Great all around steak, ribs, comfort food. Super wait staff and mgr. came around twice to check on us. Feels good to be valued!!"}
{"text":"Beat the crowd, got here at 4:00.  Super onion rings as appetizer,  bacon cheeseburger good, fresh, cooked to perfection.  Grilled chicken with candied pecans, huge.   Take home half the onion rings and half the burger,  just too much to eat.  Waitress, Justyce, friendly and helpful.  Good job Cheddars."}
{"text":"I used to love eating here. The food used to seem good and fresh and then it took a turn for the worst. The service is terrible. I think almost every waiter has seemed a little off in the head, like they couldn't process things correctly, or their brain constantly throws error messages when faced with any type of situation.... I think immature and unprofessional is the best way to describe them. Some of the waiters have no professional and service-based decorum. It didn't used to be like that though. There is usually always a wait especially on weekends. I think people really love this place because it's inexpensive and the portions are relatively large. But the quality of the food is reflected in the price. This stuff is definitely frozen, you can just tell, and not the good frozen because you know frozen food isn't all bad, but this is. It's a good place to take a group if you're the only one paying, but be prepared to wait and deal with weird waiters that just don't have it together. I blame management, the wait staff is a reflection of them. Honestly I've seen a manager or two here and I it makes sense."}
{"text":"5 stars for my latest visit. From what I was expecting to what I got exceeded my expectations, so that could be a big part of my 5 star review. Complainers tend to complain so I try and look past someone giving a bad rating cause their drink didn't get refilled in time. Things like that will happen occasionally, fortunately though for me it didn't haha. I had a freaking blast and couldn't believe that I LOVVeED EVERYTHING I tried, delicious melt in your mouth honey butter croissants,  amazingly crispy hot from the frier onion rings (in amazing dipping sauces one with kick one without)  chips & creamy spinach and artichoke dip,  chilled house salad before meal with cracked pepper & ranch dressing,  then of course my entree came just in time, the grilled lemon pepper chicken on rice with 2 SIDES, (loaded baked potato, fancy Real mac & cheese)  the chicken was so flavor and cooked so well I feel like I could taste a fire wood(cedar wood maybe) grill type flavor (not sure if they use one) but it was up there in flavor and the perfect way it came apart when I sliced into it,  usually I'd expect the Mac and cheese as more of a filler but I was so surprised how good it was and the baked potato was what you would hope a good size and properly cooked one would taste like with the right amount of cheese sour cream and real butter, add a little salt and pepper to it and it was excellent. As if it couldn't get any better a surprised chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream compliments on the house for just mentioning how good everything was, there were 6 of us total and everyone had a different dish and was freaking having foodgasams and the manager just happen to stop by at the right time doing his routine check to make sure everyone is having a enjoyable meal and a pleasant experience and I guessed he liked how much we were enjoying it. Oh I almost forgot to mention i tried my wife's steak and it was so perfectly cooked and seasoned I thought it was a higher end steak and the craziest part to all of this is my meal was 8.99, my wife's 9.99 both including the 2 sides, I added the side salad for 3 bucks and the whole party of 6 split 2 appetizers well priced I remember. I also felt like the service and atmosphere and the way the waiters were trained as well as how nice they were dressed was much above what the food cost.! Maybe you won't have an epic experience like My party and I did but I'd bet you would get close if you didn't stray to far."}
{"text":"This review is really just based on service. I went here Thursday June 12 and the service was horrible. When the waiter was putting down the napkins instead of walking around the table when it came to placing napkins on the other side, the waiter just tossed them. You would think the waiter would have known before we placed our drink orders that they were out of coke and sprite. So that was strike 1. The 2nd strike was accumulated when I ordered the country fried steak. After we ordered our food, the waiter comes back to let me know they are out of country fried steak. After that I decided to get the fried chicken steak which my aunt asked if I can get the dinner portion at the lunch price. The waiter stated with an attitude let me get the manager. So David the manager stated he wasn't able to do that for some reason. The whole time I was there I'm just thinking how do you run out of all this stuff and the restaurant had only been opened for like a hour or two. Overall I will never ever go back to this establishment!"}
{"text":"Eh...not worth the time/money in my opinion. The decor is nice, but the food is really greasy and will make you feel pretty horrible if you're not used to eating like that. The only real benefit here is that it's pretty inexpensive, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Just went here for dinner. I love the scratch kitchen items on the menu. The place is very nice and staff is kind. I liked the chicken tenders personally. The drinks are also very good and bartender was very attentive."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I stopped in on our way out of town the afternoon preceding the new years festivities. We were sat right away in a quaint little booth and were immediately greeted by a sweet, cute girl named Ashlee. We had a short convo about the new years bash and then she took our appetizer and drink orders. She came back with drinks in record time. Soon, followed the appetizer, then the food all within a very good amount of time. Food was alright, price was great and service was outstanding. Great job, Ashlee!"}
{"text":"Very big surprise.  Very good service, very good food and great prices.  I figured this was just another chain restaurant but I was wrong.  I walked away impressed and will definately return."}
{"text":"Best place to eat for dinner and drinks also. Nice setting for nice date low lights inside great atmosphere recommend this place to anyone and love the blacken fish dinner the best"}
{"text":"The mashed potatoes were pretty good but the rest of the meal was just OK probably wouldn't recommend to a friend"}
{"text":"Don't bother.....  I took my family and parents here for lunch and we were never served.  We gave our order to a waitress and after 30 minutes we still didn't get our drinks. I complained to the manager who sent another waiter. The new waiter apologized and asked that we give them another chance.  He stated that there was a problem with the first waiter and she lost our ticket.  We were patient and gave the new waiter our order. After another 15 minutes of waiting, and still not getting our drink we left. 

This was the worse service I have ever received and will never go back. You won't be in business for long."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very nice for price point. 
The food is scratch made, one of my favorite dishes was the broccoli and cheese casserole. 
I'm giving a 4-star because my food came out lukewarm. Overall service was great, and food was tasty for price point."}
{"text":"Another great meal at cheddars! However, this time we also had GREAT service. Michelle was our server and she was awesome! She was such a hard worker and very good at her job. I hope we continue to get Michelle as our waitress when we come here! Again, the food is very consistent and very good! Love the margaritas ( so cheap and good) and the chicken tenders, steak, and Cesar salad are also great. 

Also just an update from my last post. I posted about a waitress and she found me on Yelp and commented on my post! (I didn't approve the comment because she just made excuses). I thought that was soooooo unprofessional! I am not sure if she still works at cheddars but it does seem like they are better off having employees like Michelle anyway:)"}
{"text":"Last night was mediocre.  We arrived with a 2 hour  call ahead and assurance of patio seating for a family member birthday dinner. Arrived and told a 25 minute wait. I explained I had called ahead to the host. She handed me a buzzer and said nothing i can do. We only waited 20 minutes for a table. Not on patio. No explanation. Still nice big table inside but not what our party of 8 expected. Steak ordered medium was very well. Two loaded baked potatoes were loaded with butter and nothing else. One salad came with no dressing.one salad never came.   Getting water refills extra napkins and our near $100.00 check at the end wasn't timely at all. Then overcharged and had to be corrected.   In the days past the managers would stroll and ask the guests how things were. When Cheddars Chandler opened the restaurant things were good.  In part due to the managers asking if you needed anything. I think this created seperation from other like restaurants. It also helped servers with guest gap attention at the tables. I said  hello to the manager when we were leaving. He was busy, told him everything was fine. It wasnt a time for a conversation. We go to this restaurant once or twice a month. We will go back as I am counting on a better experience.  I still recommend cheddars. Fact is we like the place. Just not our night."}
{"text":"It was busy and crowded so I took that to mean good food...I was wrong. First I asked for the chicken and waffle...had my mouth geared up for a waffle and the waitress comes back to say that they had chicken but out of waffles...................I don't understand, on a Sunday afternoon when people are coming in for brunch, im going to need you to have waffles. 

Okay so then I order salmon which tasted under cooked...it was too soft. I wasn't expecting it to be burned but it tasted weird,  like it needed to be left on the grill a bit longer. So, now I'm 0-2. 

Then I get the loaded potatoe skins...........they too tasted too soft and bland. No seasoning or flavor, just cut strips of potatoe with shredded cheese and bacon bits -- I could have made that at home. That's it. No salt. No chives. No pizzazz.  So, again,  0-3. 

Then I try the cookie dessert.  The picture looked great but what I got wasn't all of that. The cookie was puffed up instead of flat like a normal cookie. It looked good but wasn't great. 0-4. 

I did try the apple pie from a friend and that was good. 

I won't eat at Cheddars again."}
{"text":"This restaurant seems like a casual, sit down kid friendly, simple food kind of place . I think the highlight for the kiddos was the salt water fish tank in the waiting area  ! Food was good , service was slow (but they were busy). Nothing stood out or screamed \" come and get me Hollywood\". So yeah, onto more adventures fare"}
{"text":"Came back to Cheddar's a couple of nights ago because I was still craving those ribs that I didn't get to try on the first visit. We arrived at the restaurant at 6:45pm. I had called ahead and asked about the wait time for 2 and I was informed that the wait was about 35 minutes. We were okay with that. When we got to the restaurant the wait had increased to 45 minutes which was whatever, I understand that they are busy and they are the new kid on the block. Right away we after sitting in the waiting area we witnessed a rather unpleasant scene unfold. A very unhappy gentleman was at the hostess stand yelling that he had been waiting for 2 hours. Now this is rather ridiculous and if he and his party had been waiting that long, they should have approached the stand earlier or just left, there is no need to wait that long to be seated in a restaurant, I guarantee the food here is not worth a 2 hour wait. They GM came over to the stand and told the man that they would get him seated immediately. He did follow the GM to the table but he was clearly very angry. After that, we witnessed about 3 other guests come up to the stand and say they had been waiting well over 45 minutes. They were all seated right away. The manager came back to the hostess stand and yelled at all of the girls (3 of them) working on the seating chart. It was very unprofessional and he should have done this at a different time in a different setting. Clearly, all they needed at that point was help. Poor management. This whole seating debacle seemed to set everything back and we didn't end up being seated until 7:45pm. 

Once seated we were greeted quickly by our waitress. She was nice and got us water right away. Unfortunately after she got us water, we only saw her about once every 15-20 minutes. First my fiance ordered a starter salad. We received this about 20 minutes after being seated. We usually share the salad so we asked for an additional plate, never got it. It had hardly any ranch on it so we asked for an extra side of ranch, we never got it. We ordered our entrees when our salad came out, I ordered the ribs with mac and cheese and cole slaw, my fiance ordered the chicken fingers 50/50 with half buffalo and half original and fries. It took another 30 minutes for the food to arrive. We saw many other tables around us, who had been seated after us receive their food before we did. I do have to say that the ribs were good, not the best I have ever had but they were tasty. The mac and cheese was really good. The problem was with my fiance's meal. First of all, the half buffalo, half original was a joke. I thought based on pictures that had been posted that the buffalo strips came out similar to a buffalo wing. Wrong. Instead they just shook some buffalo sauce over the top of the strips which coated parts of all of the chicken strips making them all buffalo, not 50/50. It also made them extremely soggy and the breading just fell apart, not very appetizing. When the chicken strips came out he had asked for barbecue sauce right away. We waited and waited and never saw our waitress. No barbecue sauce to be found. Sometimes you really need a sauce to be able to eat a meal, this was one of those cases. My fiance never received his sauce and was very unhappy about the entire meal. Service was horrible. It was non existent really. I can only imagine that based on the way that the GM was talking to the hostess staff that it also carried over to the wait staff which in turn, I'm sure makes for a very stressful environment especially for new staff. It was 9:15pm when we left the restaurant.

Overall my assessment is that Cheddar's has a long way to go to become a smooth running restaurant. They need to work out some kinks in both customer service and the kitchen in order to improve the experience for their guests. They just simply don't know how to handle how busy the restaurant currently is and this is not making a good impression for a new restaurant. It will be a long time before I visit Cheddar's again. The food is pretty good but not worth an hour wait and poor customer service."}
{"text":"The food was great, I highly recommend the chicken pot pie.  I would have given a 4 full stars but it was very poor service.  Granted, it was Christmas Eve but when we arrived at 4:30, it wasn't that busy and not once did our waitress, Paula come back to refill my drink or see if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"Heard good things about the place and decided to try it out. Hostess was very rude, asked for a table and a high chair as we our 6 month old Granddaughter with us. Directed us to a table in the very busy center section of the restaurant surrounded by senior citizens. I politely asked her to sit somewhere else as I would not want to disturb if she was to get fussy. Nothing against seniors but they do tend to get a little annoyed when they are relaxing and socializing. She got irritated and said well I have one table in the bar area, I said that was fine and she rudely asked an employee on a break to get up and move. Once we ordered we received half of our order and quickly the server explained her error which was not a problem since it was a whole rib order and she would bring out the other half. When my Husband took a bite of his broccoli he bit into a small 1 inch strip of a purple plastic thing..not too mention the broccoli didn't look that great, the second helping they brought looked much better. Also the order of ribs we did get were cold and didn't seem fresh at all, I thought it was just us but the couple next to us had the same issue with theirs. The manager came out ....at our request to apologize and make it right. We thought she had mentioned a discount for our inconvenience which was another 20 min wait...thank God the baby was on her best behavior. I hesitated on writing this review but then thought..it started out with a very rude hostess which I definitely should have mentioned to the manger..she didn't even greet us as we left..but she sure did the for the couple behind us. Not quite sure I will give this place another try :("}
{"text":"Get off work looking for place to eat, all parking lots are full all over town, nowhere to stop and eat (get in/ get out), so I decided to see if I can squeeze here in Cheddars. To my surprise it was busy but not packed, the food here was great but I have to give the Sirloin steak about a 2 only because of the flavor, it was cooked well and the presentation was good for a chain restaurant. I mentioned something about the Steak to the waitress (Paula), which she was sweet and quiet charming. The manager was quick to come come and offer his forgiveness for the steak and offer up a replacement but you know me, I am not that picky. I only wanted to finish eating because I was starving. I gave  his place 3 stars because it is a franchise chair, (not Ruth Chris), and the flavor of the steak. Don't get me wrong everything but that was great the buttered corn IS the best in the business, so good in fact it made up for the steak...yes that good. I would recommend this place I will return myself, it has a nice atmosphere and outdoor seating and if you know about AZ in the spring time the weather here is epic right now, so some wine or a beer in the outdoor patio might be the way to go if that's your thing. Well till next time my fellow Yelpers!! Bon Apatite..."}
{"text":"Go here pretty regularly.  Big servings. Never disappointed.  Probably best food for a chain restaurant.  Did I say big servings?"}
{"text":"my family usually really enjoys our food at Cheddars.I get the buffalo chicken wrap every time because it's loaded with pickles! I also love the broccoli casserole!

Getting a decent waitress is always hit or miss.. Last time we were there I ordered my usual and the waitress got my order wrong. I ordered the wrap but she put it in as buffalo chicken tenders. I heard her tell the manager that I didnt say that but I did...What an idiot. 

Overall the food is decent and prices are good, we just don't come here as often anymore because sometimes the waitresses really suck."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in here on a whim for lunch and were pleasantly surprised.  Seating and wait staff was not a problem.  My wife ordered the vegetable dish which came with a salad and 4 (yes 4) sides.  It was perfect for her.  She said that everything on it was good and more than she could eat.  The croissant looked very good from my perspective.  I got the monte cristo sandwich which was very unique and extremely good.  I commented to the waitress that I only ordered half a sand which and she said that was the half.  I could believe how big the half was. Along with that I got a baked potato which wasn't exactly as ordered but was promptly replaced.  The best part of all was the bill.  All that food and drinks for a shade over $20.  My wife and I are already planning a trip across town for another meal here.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was blown away by the great food.   the service was good and Manager was wonderful.   they told us there are prep chefs there all day and nothing sits in warming ovens all day.  My broccoli casserole was so incredibly fresh tasting, the side salad was monstrously big with a warm croissant.   Everything we had was amazing.  Friends went and told us about it and you know, i thought, how can any place be THAT good?  WELL, it WAS."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised at some of the negative reviews.  This is one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte and has actually has become, from this Charlotte franchise alone, one of my top favorite restaurants of all time in general!  I moved to Charlotte a few months ago, and before then, had never heard of - let alone been - to Cheddar's.

I went there with my boyfriend for the first time shortly after we got here, and omg... One of the best combinations of everything great in a great restaurant that I've ever encountered!

They have VERY reasonable prices...as others have mentioned, VERY good portions of food (especially for the price)...a very nice atmosphere and wait staff in all the times that I've gone...and the quality of their food ranges from good to spectacular.

I've since been to this Cheddar's maybe five or six times, and I honestly would've been more if it weren't for me trying to branch out and give other places in my area and the greater city a try as well.

It isn't any sort of \"specialty\" kind of restaurant - it's just the kind of place that offers a little bit of everything on its menu...but much of what they do offer - well, let me clarify...the things that I've had - for the most part seem to be pretty freaking great.

My boyfriend also really loves the place, by the way...

For years, I would never really be too impressed with the likes of Chilli's, T.G.I.Friday's, Applebee's, etc. because I felt their food and establishments were just....nothing special - nothing really special on their menu or about their business that set them apart from any other restaurant, let alone each other.  But the funny thing with Cheddar's is I would probably group it in the same category as those other restaurants, BUT...unlike those others, I REALLY love Cheddar's and, to me, it sets itself apart by offering consistently very good prices for consistently very good food in a consistently very good atmophere/setting.  Cheddar's has become my #1 favorite \"generic food\" type of restaurant by far.

Oh, and as at least one or two others have mentioned in their reviews, their buttery crossaints? MUAH!"}
{"text":"First off our server Shawn was a solid 100! He never dropped the ball always had glasses filled! What an asset, clone him for all your servers!
So for the food: Queso and chips for signing up added bonus totally unexpected. My food the Cajun pasta great, Shawn went out of his way to make sure it was spicy. No complaints here what so ever. 
My date all had a great experience the bourbon glazed salmon, she loved it.
Not sure about the negative reviews here but I would ignore them completely. We had a great time with great food.
To management: I would suggest promoting Shawn to a trainer, he deserves it! 
We will be back soon, thanks guys!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"** UPDATED 4/11/17**
Was contacted and said they thanked me for taking the time to comment, apologized and said he really wanted to fix this issue and send me something in the mail. Well, it has been almost 2 weeks since I spoke to him and I have yet to receive anything in the mail, I wonder if this was handed off to the manager of the location and they let it fall through the cracks?\" 

We went there today and our waitress was very slow And unfriendly, I have been here dozens of times and I have never had this experience. Not only we have been waiting an hour almost on just our food."}
{"text":"First time at Cheddar's!  Amazing food! The service was even better! Our server, Jason, really went above and beyond! He made the experience great! He took his time with us, we felt like we were his only table, yet the restaurant was packed! He offered menu suggestions and was 100% correct! We constantly had drinks on the table and was sure to make sure we weren't missing anything! Definitely a new favorite!"}
{"text":"This place was soooo good. This was my second time coming here. Both times for dinner. 1st time had the mango tilapia and 2nd time had the a heat shrimp & chicken from the lighter side menu. Also, the flavored ice teas especially  the peach are yummy & refreshing. Food comes out fast, the service is great, staff very friendly & the prices are amazing. Cant wait to go back again & again & again!!!"}
{"text":"Based on other previous reviews, my dad and I skipped a dinner here 2 weeks ago (my dad is very particular when it comes to service). I figured 2 weeks was long enough to get things situated and it was time to give it a shot. We were not disappointed!

To sum things up for readers: Out of all the different items ordered, only 1 was a regret. The service was prompt, friendly, helpful and didn't miss a step. Because it was only one side dish that didn't make the grade, I decided it wouldn't be fair to knock it down a star just for that.  So my experience still deserves a 5 star and will look forward to a repeat visit in the future. 

Read on if you are one for details:

We arrived at just after 4pm on a Thursday and were seated immediately.  Within 2 minutes our server Blake was there to ask about our drink order. We always go for iced tea but my dad needs to have a spoon for stirring (lack of spoon puts you on the never again list) and extra lemon. After another 5 minutes,Blake had teas, lemons and the ever important spoon delivered for thirst quenching to commence. 

He asked if we had a chance to think about appetizers and though we hadn't, my dad asked him what he would order. He hands down told us their hand battered onion rings. So began our Cheddar's food adventure. 

The onion rings are amazing but the portion is huge for 2 people. For entrees, I ordered the steak and chicken tender (as these were also highly recommened by our awesome server) combo with green beans, baked potato and mushrooms. My dad chose the Ribeye meal with mushrooms, green beans and mac n cheese. 

Blake didnt miss a step when it came to drink refills. He had it there before even asked and he even remembered the extra lemons in my dad's. 

As to entree taste: I give it an 85%. Of course everyone has different tastes but here is the breakdown for me.

1) Steak- both were cooked as requested. Not overpowered by seasoning. 

2) Chicken tenders - I see why they brag about these. The batter had a great flavor that was very crispy and yet not greasy. The chicken itself was cooked perfect to retain all its juiciness!

3) Mushrooms - not a flavor I am used to as at home I am a simple butter and extra dash of salt gal but they were good and thankfully not overcooked. 

4) Baked Potato- Yes you can screw up a potato but thankfully this wasn't one of the times. Only I wish bacon wasn't an extra charge :(

5) Green Beans - I am more of a salty gal rather than sweet so it was odd to have sweetened green beans. No idea with what (my dad thought maybe brown sugar?) but those I had to use the salt shaker on. 

6) Mac n Cheese - This was the one side dish we felt was seriously lacking. Being I make my own from scratch I figured its gotta be at least half as good. NOPE... my comment on this to my dad \"I think I would have been better off with mac n cheese from KFC across the way\". YUP... that sad. 

If you braved your way through this, hope you have a delicious experience too. :)"}
{"text":"Fair food service is okay! It's a nice place its new. I would say an upscale tx roadhouse! Food is plentiful for the price. Mgr running around but never saw visit any tables. Time of order to service is fair. Third visit and so far as long as things stay on the better side of good, we'll continue to visit."}
{"text":"Came out to eat with my friends and this place is a really good spot to come out to eat! We were all coming back home after spending the day at the lake and a friend suggested we come eat here. At first arriving this place looked so fancy and we basically all smelled like lake water  but honestly I loved it here the food is so inexpensive and not too much of a wait time for the food either. I recommend the buffalo tenders!"}
{"text":"My family is disgusted by the treatment we received last night from the staff here. This location needs to either shut down or fire every one and start over.

As someone who waited tables before, there's nothing valuable about having a staff who doesn't care about giving great service to every guest who walks in the door. Every individual brings in money for not only the business, but the waiter or waitress."}
{"text":"Place was new so we decided to check it out. After coming off an Asian trip, I thought American food sounded good.

The Cheddar's Pain Killer was a nice drink to start us off. Along with the Wisconsin cheese bites (addictive) and chips and queso (good). 

Our server warned us that their portions were large here and we did notice a few to-go bags leaving while we were waiting, so we kept that in mind when ordering our main dish. Between our family we tried the baby back ribs (ok), chicken tenders (ok), Sweet Heat Chicken & Shrimp (a joke), Top Sirloin Steak (so rubbery it was painful to eat), and the smokehouse burger (good but regular size).

We noticed that in no way did any of the portions seem \"large\" in comparison to any other restaurants I've been to, so not sure why that was emphasized by our waiter.

All-in-all, this is typical chain-style American food. The drink I had was good, the meal I had was forgetable. The value wasn't there either. We all agreed we wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Missed going to the Cheddars in the Midwest and still remember the best server ever in Cedar Rapids.  But this one ain't that one and it was about the opposite experience.  We bussed our own table in the bar because they had a 30 minute wait.  But then we sat there for at least 5 minutes with servers walking by over and over without even smiling, saying hi or greeting us.  When the server finally came, all was well until our app (chips & queso) arrived with a long black hair on top of the chips.  That was fixed but when it came time to order, I couldn't upgrade or chose a soup instead of a salad.  Food was decent but certainly didn't get good service and definitely won't be back to this one.  I will give Cheddars another shot just not this one."}
{"text":"I'm giving these fine folks five stars for their fantastic service, teamwork, patience, and accommodating nature. The food is solid at every location I have been to, but today they won over our family on the service front. We brought our family in right at the start of the Sunday lunch rush. We're talking 3 large booths full of family that doesn't see each other often and we did not make it easy on the wait staff. People were moving from booth to booth to visit and chat with one another so no one wound up sitting with the rest of the people on their check. People moved after ordering. Plus, people arrived staggered over 45 minutes - during lunch rush. WE were \"those people\" today. I know the staff had to be happy when we left, but let me tell you, they never once let it show. They made sure we had a great experience despite how much frustration we were causing them. To the staff I must say BRAVO! And - I hope you don't have to deal with anything like that again in a long, long time.

Bacon cheese fries were a big hit. The steak and chicken tender combo was massive. Seriously, each tender looked like a whole breast. Salmon was good as well as the mashed potatoes and mushrooms. Tortilla soup was on point."}
{"text":"Hands down, the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. The wait was 35 minutes, but we were told we could grab a table in the bar. Three tables sat dirty, no one remotely concerned, and it was busy. We asked for a rag to wipe it down ourselves, then waited 10 minutes for a server to wait on us. After our appetizer came out cold, our food was still not there after 35 minutes. After listening to several employees bad mouth customers within earshot of us, we had enough. We had the manager come over, and explained to him that I've seen episodes of Bar Rescue go better than Cheddar's was today. The best part of the afternoon was our food was comped, as it should have been. We were walking out until he offered that, and still almost did. The food itself was fine, but the service at Cheddar's today was bad enough that we will never go back."}
{"text":"The service wasn't great. The waitress had a attitude. I couldn't find the list of sides and then I couldn't make up my mind quickly, she was just standing there glaring at me, Instead of offering a suggestion to be helpful. The server brings out our food, sets the plates down, and doesn't ask if we might need anything or does it look okay. My sister got the veggie plate. Green beans, broccoli, salad, and macaroni & cheese. The macaroni & cheese looked and tasted like it was from yesterday's service or wall paper paste. I ordered the steak and grilled shrimp, with a side salad, and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes was pretty good. The steak was the quality of a off brand \"steak house\", and the grilled shrimp was way over cooked. Neither had any flavor. So not worth the money. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Onion rings are to die for but don't order for 2 must have at least 4 to help you eat them. Burgers are good also. Waitress we had was great & friendly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in here Sat. Afternoon and sat at the bar. We were immediately greeted by New the bartender. She was super sweet and fast at making drinks. We really enjoyed our food and great service. We will definitely be back and sit at the bar."}
{"text":"My friends and I ordered chicken fingers and French fries. We couldn't even eat the chicken fingers because the big chunks of white meat was like cutting and chewing rubber. The French fries were cold, limp and tasteless. Our server didn't give us any credit on our card. Kentucky Fried Chicken is so much better, and the chicken is more tender. It's kind of hard to ruin chicken fingers and fries any where you go! They're great at Red Robin. Cheddars is way over priced for three people. Had to wait quite awhile since it was Saturday afternoon. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat there again. There are better restaurants in Chandler."}
{"text":"So my family and I go to have lunch my daughters ask can we sit in the bar the host says yes if you want a booth you can sit there also we say ok and we sit in a small booth.  The waiter Tyrone comes and say for future reference you can't just seat your self in a booth wow nice way to greet paying customers um I'm good I would never eat here I'm OUT."}
{"text":"Wow if you are looking for a Denny's atmosphere but lower quality of food than this is the place for you. Ate here on a Sunday afternoon. Service was fast, so fast that our appetizers, soup and main course we're all delivered together. Wife and I both got violently ill. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Have been to Cheddars in several locations, and the service is always the same....poor.  This has to be a corporate culture thing.  The staff stand around gossiping among themselves, completely oblivious to what is going on around them.  My server, who was at least trying, had no confidence, experience, and/or individual discretion for achieving customer service.  Each time I had a question he had to go ask his boss, and each time, he came back with a \"no\" answer.  No, we can't sub onion rings, even for an up-charge... Blah blah blah... My appetizer was completely forgotten, but there was no apology and no effort to make it right.  On our way out of the restaurant, four hostess girls were crowded around the hostess booth, chatting, and not one noticed us, or said thank you.  When a restaurant is so new to town, would expect to see best foot forward for at least a few months.  The food was ok, but nothing special... You can do better going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Can't give this place. Higher rating wish you had 10 *'s!  Our server Zachary was totally great food beyond great just decided this is our new favorite place to dine!!"}
{"text":"Oh boy. I'm typically fairly impressed by Cheddars but this time it was just \"okay\". I could tell our server was new, which I can be forgiving for. He was fairly slow at getting items to the table, it was difficult for him to even get the drink order. My mom had a \"free appetizer\" coupon for signing up for their club, which she was charged for, and then which a manager came over and said \"you need to email that to us, and then we can print it out, and then we can take it off\". I reviewed the coupon, no where on it did it say we had to print the coupon off. Then, when my parents ordered their second glass of wine another server came back and asked us to take their glasses because they had to wash them out and pour the wine into the glass. The food was pretty good but the frustration with the coupon was annoying and the server seemed to be flustered throughout the course of the meal."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Cheddar's in CO about 10 times, it was always a 5 or 4 at the worst.

So...  Craving their chicken fried steak for about a year, I decided to make to 24 mile drive to this Cheddar's in Chandler.

I arrived shortly after they opened - about 11:20 am.  That may have been part of the issue - they were busy getting ready for the day.

I ordered the CFS, mashed potatoes, and green beans.  I'd never had their green beans before, and they reminded me of what came out of a Del Monte can back when I was a kid.  Not good, in other words.  I've always had and enjoyed the broccoli in previous visits.

The main event - the CFS....  well...  it was rubbery.  Nothing like I'd experienced at Cheddar's before.  Definitely not up to their normal standards that I've experienced over the past 7 years.

The bartender/waitress was busy, but she saved the day when she asked me if I wanted an iced tea for the road.  That was an unexpected nice touch.

I'll make the trip south to give the place a chance to redeem itself in the future - when they are on their game there isn't a comparable Chicken Fried Steak.  I know how it is when a place just opens for the day, next time I'll arrive a little later in the day."}
{"text":"I love Cheddars!  As a college kid, I discovered the one in Newport News,  and had to go once a month.  I cannot tell you how well priced most items are for the huge portions and taste payoff!  They have many staples but you must order the strawberry lemonade (made fresh), the chicken tenders (HUGE, crispy) and the warm chocolate cookie (comes in hot pan).  The croissants are not free but one should splurge  on them for an appetizer.  These items I listed, usually ran out on the weekends at that VA location.  Trust me, this place is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place. Affordable pricing. Very friendly staff. Get the cheddars pain killer.  This place would be great to get together with friends in the bar without the loud club-like scene"}
{"text":"Yelp is right on point  with this place great food served got and very reasonable for food portion size  our service was great overall but our waitress was very soft spoken hard to gear her and honestly seemed like she didn't want to be there"}
{"text":"Our server definitely earned this location the 4th star! He was so attentive and caring, he checked on us more times than I could count! As for he food, it wasn't a wow factor. I ordered a 6 oz sirloin with loaded baked potato and broccoli. My broccoli was soft and a bit mushy and the potato and steak were just basic. I ordered a skinny margarita which tasted a bit off (but it was because an agave sour was used. Will I return, maybe!"}
{"text":"Cheddar's has a wonderful atmosphere for casual and business people and they have a number of options from salads, soups and sandwiches to full entrees. The decor has such a sleek modern feel with a few strokes of country in there. I really want to love it but the food is so sub par.
The service is good... but they try to be great which just comes off a little rushed. I have come when it isn't very crowded at around 3 pm on weekdays so they shouldn't be in such a hurry. They are quite friendly overall and refill drinks often. The first time I ordered the lemon pepper fish and it was well cooked as the texture was flaky and soft but it is far too salty. I had a similar experience with their sweet heat chicken and their Monte cristo sandwich as well as their sausage pasta. Everything is oversalted. I keep coming because it is close to the job and they seem to have quality ingredients but they just need to cut the salt. Their one redeeming menu item so far is the chicken strip basket. Those chicken strips are tender and crisp and the meat is moist. It is well breaded but I still do prefer real chicken skin over breading.
Overall I would like this place so much more if the food was less salted"}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and I have not been disappointed.

The restaurant is located off of W.T. Harris across the street from the old Wal Mart. I love the decor of the place especially the fans that are huge leaves and the fish tank. The booths are HUGE and can accommodate 4 people to a row easy. Not to mention, they're wide enough to shove a car seat into them without a struggle.

The wait staff has always been nice, attentive, and they pay attention to details (I am kind of a picky eater so this is a huge plus for me). A couple of them will sit down with you and chat just a little if you're in the mood to have company (but they don't linger too long). 

The food has always been great! I've had their burgers (which are cooked to order perfectly), chicken dishes (haven't had a dry piece of chicken yet), and their salads. My food has always been hot (or nice and cool for the salad), on time, and full of flavor. I recommend their burgers though, they actually season the ground beef before throwing it on the grill (yes, I've been to places that don't do that).

If you're not full after eating all the food you got, don't forget about dessert! Their desserts are humongous and it'll take at least 2 people to eat the whole thing. I've had all of their desserts and I recommend all of them. They range from a death by chocolate cake, to a simple ice cream sundae.

This is a great place to just chill, have a few drinks, and enjoy great food. I would recommend this to everybody."}
{"text":"Disappointment #1: there's not a lot of Cheddar
Disappointment #2: delectable sounding \"broccoli casserole\" is code for velveeta, saltines, rice and a piece or two of broccoli
Disappointment #3: cold food 
I assumed that the reason it took so long to get the food was that everything is supposedly cooked from scratch. And apparently cooking from scratch means not using heat because my key west chicken and shrimp consisted of 4 ice cold shrimpy shrimp on the smallest chicken breast known to man. They had to have trimmed meat off of said chicken breast to get it so small unless it was actually squab. The aforementioned broccoli casserole was in the shape of a scooper in a side dish. The sauce on the chicken and shrimp was tasty and was mixed with canned pineapple and some diced tomorrow to make \"pineapple pico de gallo\".
My husband got the sirloin and shrimp. I am not sure what weight it was supposed to be, but it was smaller than my chicken breast.  And it was medium well rather than medium. He did enjoy the fried shrimp which were much larger than their cold cousins on my plate. The drink menu looked interesting, but I wouldn't recommend eating."}
{"text":"The waiters here are amazing. The waiter that we had took the time to get to know all my kids names. I ordered the pecan salad and it was great. We waited almost no time for our delicious meal!! I was sooo impressed!!! For a newer business it was great!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wifey and I shared a spinach dip, cheeseburger and buffalo chicken wrap. It was very good, burger tasted freshly made as well as the wrap.  The dip was a great portion too. Next time I'm in chandler I'll stop in. Nick our server was very attentive and professional."}
{"text":"The good 
Friendly staff and waitress
Quick and very attentive waitress. 
Chips and queso were delicious. 

The bad 
Baja chicken was mostly black beans with a little bit of chicken. Tasted ok. Probably wouldn't order it a second time. 

The ugly
Men's bathroom could be cleaned more frequently."}
{"text":"Hands down, the nicest group of people ever. I hate having to leave a bad review but I just could not believe how many times my order was incorrect. Came here with family friends and ordered the steak and shrimp and specified that I wanted the steak medium to medium well. Steak came back overdone. Travis the waiter, Who was wonderful,  apologized and offered me a salad while I waited and the rest of my party ate. The second steak came out and Travis waited until I cut into it to make sure it was right and sure enough it was completely well done. He apologized again and said he would have the manager come over. By this time my party had finished eating. The manager came over and apologized again. He informed me that the kitchen manager was back in the kitchen and would be personally cooking my steak. Even though I didn't want to have my party wait I really wanted the steak more than ever now of course since numerous steaks had come to the table and been taken away. Finally the THIRD steak came out and I was so glad and I cut into it and could not believe it was completely well done. This time I thought maybe they don't have pink steaks and I'll just taste it. Dry and over done. I just could not believe it. So Travis comped the meal, apologized profusely and we paid the remainder of the bill. Left disappointed and  hungry."}
{"text":"My fiancé had been raving about this place so we decided to have dinner here. My steak and sides were good, he enjoyed his sandwich and our onion rings were also really good. Service was decent, he was very friendly. The hostess did bump into the food runner and knocked some of our onion rings onto the floor. The poor guy kept apologizing profusely, however we only lost about 3-4 of them and we didn't really care. Good value for the food!"}
{"text":"I like cheddar but I hate the fact that they are so busy!! And I hate that everytime I do go inside we always sitted next to BIG group of people and annoying kids! They are just so loud kids and babies. People gonna hate my comments but anyone wouldn't wanna sit next to annoying kids. When u try to enjoy your food."}
{"text":"Was brought here by friends while visiting Charlotte.  We loved it!  The service was great and the food was really good taking into consideration the type of restaurant it is.  I would equate it to a TGIFridays, Ruby Tuesday or Applebees, but tad bit better than all three.  Be sure  to try try those warm buttery croissants.  Everyone was pleased with their food tastes and portions. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"We were in the area, doin some shopping, and getting hangry!  So we did some searches and came up with Cheddars.  It was new to us and a quick look at the menu seemed like it had a nice variety.

Something which scared us at first, there were tons of people standing outside and just inside their door way.  So we immediately thought there would be a long wait.  We figured it was a post-church rush, given it was a Sunday.

We waded through the mass and made it to the hostess stand.  We asked the wait time for two, and she said, \"Oh, there isn't one.\"  

AWESOME!  

\"But just wait over there and someone will seat you.\"  :/  Huh?  What happened to no wait??

About 5 minutes later, we sat down at a nice sized booth and given some menus.  We had time to run through it and figure out what we wanted to eat and drink.  So, we waited.  And waited some more.  And then thought, \"Its been 5 minutes, and not even waters have been delivered... Should we just leave??\" 

Just then, our waitress popped over.  We placed our orders and chatted about our shopping plans.  During the discussion, we unraveled our neatly wrapped silverware, to find the fork and knife were both dirty with dried up food :(  

Our food showed up relatively quick.  Not fast, not slow.  We got a club sandwich with coleslaw and some salmon with broccoli and rice.  Both meals looked good and tasted good.  Though, the coleslaw wasn't much for a side.  Literally two good sized bites and it's done.  


All in all... it wasn't a bad experience.  But we weren't wow'd by it either.  We may give it another shot...."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! There is something for everyone! Their grilled lemon pepper fish is so good' service is great and everyone is always happy and smiling. Chicken tenders are very crispy and tasty as well. The piña colada is to die for! A glass rimmed with honey and coated with coconut!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! 2nd visit to this restaurant and I love everything about it. Only had to wait for about 15 minutes to be sat on a Friday evening (2 people).
Our server was outstanding, answered questions about the menu with great detail and always made sure we had everything we needed and never felt rushed. The steaks are AMAZING; cooked perfectly as ordered. Broccoli cheddar casserole AMAZING; medium crunchy fresh broccoli.The restaurant was very clean, bathrooms are really nice and also very clean. Very surprised with the price as well, prices are more then reasonable for the portions and quality. Will start coming more frequently!"}
{"text":"Wel l  I heard the big buzz about this place .  the design and decorations of the inside and outside are Very nice. but the food  and the service was just ok. we came in We had a 15 minute wait to sit down so we got more Excited .we finally sat down and ordered our appetizer which was the chicken fingers with the queso and spinach dip. they make sure to tell you before you sit down that 90 percent of their cooked items are made from scratch.  The appetizer came out pretty quickly. don't ever order the queso dip because it tastes Exactly like that Tostitos queso cheese dip. the spinach dip was delicious but it was cold in the middle so they had to take it to the back to reheat it but they just brought me a new one. The  chicken fingers were just like any other chicken fingers but they were fresh. then we waited 43 minutes to get two burgers and a salmon. the Burger was good but it was nothing to rave about the mac and Cheese tasted like store bought mac and cheese And the fries were good . My wife said the salmon could have been cooked at a higher temperature it was blackened . all in all the price very fair for the food it's better than denny's and probably a little bit cheaper than denny's all I know Is your going to wait and there hours on there website are wrong they close at 10 not 11 on weekdays had to find out the hard way . But its a good 3 stars. Just make sure not to order the queso and the mac and cheese."}
{"text":"The food is great here, with the exception of this last time we visited. So many wonderful menu options! The steak and shrimp is my favorite! The 2 stars is simply because each and every time we've eaten here the service is horrible! Once you place your order, you'd be thankful to see your server before your meal arrives to ensure you're doing okay. Last week our server took our order and we didn't see her again until about 20 minutes after the manager brought out our meals. The steak was overcooked and not \"medium\" as I had ordered. It was so dry that I dipped it in the sauce that comes with the grilled shrimp. This place has so much potential if the service would improve. No one, besides the hosts/hostesses, seem happy to be there."}
{"text":"If this had been the first time at Cheddar's I would have given them no stars and never returned.  However I have eaten there several times and the food had been very good and the service excellent so they get two stars based on past experience.  My last experience definitely put a bad taste in my mouth ( no pun intended). I ordered the tilapia with mango salsa. The fish tasted like it had been cooked on a the same grill the cook their hamburgers.  It was burned and greasy.  The broccoli was old and the meal was tasteless.  I sent back my order and the second order was not much better.  I was offered no compensation for the poor food quality.  It will be a very long time before I go back."}
{"text":"I've had pot pie, fish and chips, and tortilla soup.  All were very good. The fish and chips are better than I have found in many restaurants.  It's definitely an entree that can be shared.  Nice selection of entrees and family friendly!"}
{"text":"Been waiting to get through a Monte Cristo just like back home in Cleveland at Bar melt and grill.  I drove all the way from Vegas to Phoenix for a bike event then drove to Chandler just to try it.  Was bummed when Mt bestie could not eat the Monte Cristo because it had pork on it and the could not take it out."}
{"text":"Good food. Had the dinner portion of the chicken fried chicken.my only complaint is when my food came out I had to ask for more gravy I got 2 large chicken breast and maybe only 3 Oz of gravy. Chicken was so tinder I didn't even need the knife to cut it. Over all I'm satisfied."}
{"text":"watched this place get built in 2013 and I am super happy I remembered to check back in. this place has great food and cheap drinks - the Texas tea and Texas margarita are top notch!"}
{"text":"We meet up with some friends on a Wednesday night and this place was jam packed. Luckly our friends had already been seated (one of the perks of always being late) so I can't comment on the wait problem others have mentioned. The booths there are huge and you can seat four people on one side which is pretty nice for big groups. Anyway we were seated and our waiter 'Brian' (i think) came quickly and got our drinks. He was super friendly and joking around with us the whole time. And not the awkward joking like, go away creepy dude, but genuine good conversation. The food came with a little wait but it was to be expected and we had a great meal. Good portions and service while we were eating was timely. 

They also have a huge fish tank with beautiful freshwater African Ciclids. Yes I'm a fish aquarium nerd also... Anyway you can tell the tank is well maintained which is a good sign for a restaurant. If they take the time or care to pay someone to come and maintain their fish tank then you can guarantee that the quality of the basic restaurant is top notch also. Honestly how many restaurants have you been to with fish tanks where the water level is half way down the tank and the fish are swimming in cloudy dimly lit water. People I tell you now!! If you see that turn around and leave! THE FOOD WILL BE OF THE SAME QUALITY!

*rant off*

Cheddars is a solid place to go eat, just get there after the rest of your party and you'll be a happy camper!"}
{"text":"Nothing memorable.  Huge portions, and the price is good, the food looks more like food from a sports bar.  I was expecting more from other reviews and the fact the place is listed as one of the 200 best places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"best service we've had in a long time , plus they have the best rib's in arizona !! great staff, clean place all around great night out , keep up the good work !!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a casual meal. Wide variety on menu.  Great prices.  Most of the food is made from scratch.  The croissant are too good to skip."}
{"text":"Love the Texas Margarita. Frozen with no salt please :-) Seriously, it's huge, cheap and delicious. How do they do it for under $4?

The food here is pretty decent as well (for a chain) ... I've had one bad meal in fifteen. 

The margarita!!!! :-)"}
{"text":"Not happy with this location. We have been there 4 times and all times we have had issues, food, service and even other customers. The University location is 100% better 5stars!!!! Hands down!!!!"}
{"text":"I took my sister to dinner last night and she choose Cheddar's. The food was fantastic! The chicken fried steak was delicious! I'll definitely be back.Michelle, our server was nice and friendly. Great dinner, great service!"}
{"text":"Although I try to avoid chain restaurants this one is an exception I am willing to make. Everything is made in house and from scratch! I have never ordered anything I didn't like. you can't go wrong with the chicken strips, burger, salmon, salads and a pain killer is a must. I tend to sit in the bar and consistently have great service. Good prices for the portion sizes, just come in already!"}
{"text":"Food is great.   But expect to be on hold forever for a to go order.  It's almost like they hope you hang up.   As a regular,  I suggest eating in or ordering in person."}
{"text":"Bland food, subpar service, but the environment is nice and airy... Such a disappointment."}
{"text":"Great food!  There is no place like this on the east side... very unique. Loved the fish and chips ( I actually replaced chips for loaded baked potato)"}
{"text":"When I lived in the University area a few years ago I used to LOVE this place! It was a nice environment and reasonable prices. I was feeling a little nostalgic and begged my hubby to drive all the way from Matthews back to Cheddar's for dinner the other night. Bad decision. This place has gone waaaaaaay downhill. I ordered my favorite potato soup for an appetizer, and it arrived COLD!?!?!? My burger was beyond greasy, I couldn't even eat it and I lost my appetite fast. My husband was not happy with his food and stopped at Taco Bell on the way home for some \"quality\" food, lol. What happened to the Cheddar's I loved in 2005?"}
{"text":"Best chicken tenders are here!! Seriously if someone local asks me for reccomendations, this place is def top 3 to mention. Pain killer drink is so yummy and nice buzz as you're living dinner. The ambience is super chill and laid back. The food is all good and I seriously never been dissapointed. You have to try this place out. 
\"Trust your fat homies, we are big for a reason.\""}
{"text":"After over an hour, the food finally arrived.

Being ignored and dismissed is just perfect.

Yes, the food was comped after it FINALLY came out ... but seriously?"}
{"text":"This place needs to open in the west valley. There is a shuttered mexican restaurant at Westgate that they could move into as the place is big enough. The only chain restaurant that rates 5 stars; huge portions, great prices and everything that comes out of the kitchen is amazing. Best Ribs for a non bbq joint. Chicken tenders are the best I've ever tasted. The bread pudding is one of my favorite desserts."}
{"text":"A few good things.  The food was excellent as were the drinks.  The prices are very reasonable for this type of restaurant.  Our waitress seemed to be hard working and did a very good job for us. 

The bad things.  The place needs some cleaning b and the bus boys seemed to be just standing around and not interested in cleaning off tables.  I saw our waitress bus more tables Han the bus boy.  

The 1st hostess we had seemed confused but then another showed up and brought us menus. 

Our waitress seemed to be the only one knowing what she was doing and she actually seemed as though she was new"}
{"text":"Food was good, but was only served at room temperature. It was very obvious that our server was new, he didn't seem to know what he was doing."}
{"text":"Great Food. Great Scene.. Wonderful service with Fernanda. Food portions hearty. Clean restrooms. Fast service. Not Bad at all Cali Native."}
{"text":"This is another one of our favorite restaurants when in Chandler.  The choices on the menu are good and the food delicious.

We stopped for dinner.  I keep going back to the salmon dinner.  It is so good and always cooked perfectly.  This time I tried the bourbon sauce on the side.  It was delicious as a dip.  Our server was amazing.  

We will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Honey croissants are delicious! I had the New Orleans pasta and it was delish too! The decor is nice but I think it's a little too formal for the type of food they serve. Also it is warm inside. Most restaurants usually have the air conditioning on blast but this place had me sweating a bit. Oh and the tortilla chips with cheesy dip is ridiculously good. Will def go back!"}
{"text":"I've passed Cheddar's a number of times, and while I'm a fan of cheese, we just never stopped in.  Until we were utterly repulsed by Bikinis next door.  Since we were hungry, we decided that we'd just walk to Cheddar's, rather than driving elsewhere to find something to eat.

The place is actually pretty nice, and I was impressed.  I figured that it would be a knock-off of an Applebee's or Chili's or something along those lines, and the outside looks about the same, but on the inside it is considerably more upscale.

Once we were inside, we were seated quickly, and the staff was very friendly.  What's more, the entire restaurant was non-smoking - a big plus over Bikinis next door.  I understand that some people like to smoke, and I don't mind, I just don't like to be assaulted by it as soon as we walk in.

The menu had a good selection, but not an overwhelming one.  It was your pretty typical casual fare, with a nice variety of other options such as steak and shrimp.  Since we smelled the burgers on our way in, that was my choice.  It was huge.  Denise went with chicken fingers, and the portion was similarly gigantic - she brought some home, snacked on them that night and still has some leftovers!

Throughout the meal, service was great, glasses were kept full, and everything was quite a surprise.  Definitely a step up from your typical casual dining fare.  The only real downside is getting to the place - it's not hard to get into the location, but getting out can be a bit of a bear because the lights can get out of sync, making it hard to get back onto Harris."}
{"text":"These two stars sum up my experience - \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" The prices are very reasonable, we were actually stunned at a burger and fries under $7! But I'm assuming the quality of the food determines the low prices. We weren't too impressed. It was okay, I wasn't unhappy by any means, but I don't think I'll come back."}
{"text":"We had taken a bit of a Cheddar's break hoping their service issues would be resolved with a bit more experience and it would appear that is indeed the case.  Our most recent experience was much different from our prior encounters.  We were greeted immediately upon entering the restaurant and seated right on the spot as well (good timing on our part as they had a lobby full on our way out).  The server was very friendly and all meals came out as ordered.  I saw what I assume was the manager walking around observing the team, which is not something I'd seen previously.  The atmosphere has been well maintained.  Comfortable seating and a very nice decor.  The food itself was very good.  A great improvement and worthy of an updated review."}
{"text":"Went to have lunch today.  We did not have to wait long for the food.  Food was great  and our server Trevor was very accommodating for all the little requests we asked and he did it all with a smile."}
{"text":"Less than impressed with the food and the service.  We got there after 9 pm and were seated right away. The waitress took our drink order but never told us about the specials or what she recommended.
It took a really long time to get our food and when it arrived it was not hot.  The cheese had already gotten hard.  The waitress never offered to refill our drinks.
The couple at the table behind us left without eating.
The prices were actually good, but we would have enjoyed McDonald's better."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my family, I loved the giant paddle fan in one of their dining rooms. We sat at the bar and started immediately on their Enormous Cocktails,  I had the Spiked Strawberry Lemonade it was very refreshing. For lunch I had the New Orleans pasta DELICIOUS, and shared a Caesar salad which came with its own pasta as well. All in all we had a wonderful first time at Cheddar's. The Sweet Buttery Croissants are a MUST HAVE. I bet you can't eat just one."}
{"text":"First and last time here.

1) Wouldn't seat a partial party. We had 10, and about 4 entered while the others were stuck in traffic. Wouldn't seat us, despite the possibility of large tip and inconvenience of waiting when we could have been ordering appetizers and drinks for everyone.

2) Ran out of Pepsi & Sprite. Pretty unapologetic about it despite our attempts to laugh it off. 


3) Ran out of  country-fried steak. Asked for another option adjusted to lunch size/price. Server got an attitude, said he would get manager. Manager said \"we are a scratch restaurant and our goal is to run out of food, so we really can't do anything about it.\"

4) (update) had the chicken and waffles. I very rarely if ever eat meat, so suspected my body was reacting when I became ill; however 24 hours later and I still have stomach cramping and pain, as does others in my party who had chicken and waffles. No one else in the party is ill, however. (6/13/14). 
WHAT??? So, your GOAL is to DISAPPOINT??? We came in with high spirits after graduation to lackluster service and the food was \"ok\" at best, probably would have tasted better with better service. Sad to say, I will not patronize this establishment ever again."}
{"text":"Lots of comfort food for you to enjoy. From the appetizers down to the sides. Poor brew selection though. Figured everyone was trying to take advantage of the craft beer craze. Had to seat myself, which seemed odd. Ordered the Salmon, blackened with bourbon glaze on the side. Glaze was awesome, but the fish was a minute or two overcooked. Still, decent dish and the broccoli casserole was very wholesome. Waitress was very short with us though, trying to turn the table I presume. What's with all the cameras around the building?"}
{"text":"Although the food is pretty darn good on a consistent basis, I have to say that ordering carry out from Cheddar's, especially on the weekends is frustrating. Transferring takeout orders to the bar phone, especially when they are busy, leaves you waiting on the phone listening to the ring tone forever, and then eventually gets you transferred back to the front desk to the hostess who (at least tonight) gets irritated that the client is frustrated that no one is answering the phone to take the order. After two rounds of this, we ordered from Rigatony's."}
{"text":"This was my second time at Cheddar's. First time at this one. We were a large group and had to wait over an hour to get seated. 
Then when we did get seated, the service wasn't that good. The waitress took a long time to get our drink order and took a while to get them to us as well. Then when she finally came and took our order, we had to wait a long time to receive our food. It took so long that the group that came in after us got their food before we got ours! Different waiter! 
When we did get our food it was good, but some of it was cold to. 
I think if the group was smaller it would have been better. Maybe the waitress was new! IDK! We were not to happy, but we did eat! Not the best service, but the food was good."}
{"text":"Bland food....salty without the salt....typical chain restaurant in the middle of a shopping center....glorified Denny's.....clean bathrooms"}
{"text":"I often frequent Cheddar's but after my experience on Saturday night I will never go again.  I called to place an order and was transferred to the bar area no one ever picked up.  I called again they just hung up.  I called again and was transferred again after waiting another 15 minutes no picked up so I decided to just go up there.  Why offer take out if no one ever picks up to get your order.  Why don't y'all have online ordering anyway?  I walked in and went straight to the bar and at the time only had 3 people sitting there and I was still on hold.  I placed my order a total of 27.00 bucks.  I ordered Country Fried Steak, spaghetti stuff and chips and Que so and when I got home they didn't give me GRAVY.  How do you forget the Gravy when a person orders Country Fried Steak!!!!! I drove all the back to Cheddar's requested my Gravy and requested to speak with a manager.  I waited for 10 minutes management never came out to speak with me.  They kept saying because it was too busy.  Cheddar's has lost my business!!!"}
{"text":"So happy there is now a Cheddar's in Arizona! Great, affordable food and friendly staff. Very clean environment! Try the chicken pot pie and don't forget to ask for those croissants!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty dang good, however, MARK makes up for any shortcomings with his 5 star service! \"The water tastes like sewer. Probably the biggest reason we don't visit more often\" That was the comment I left months back. 

This evening we had MARK for server and I purposely didn't order water for the fact that it tastes so bad and I won't even sip it. MARK looked at me weird when I said I didn't want anything to drink with the meal. A few minutes later he came back and asked if I wanted anything when the food comes out. I said no again, but added that I didn't want any water because it tasted so horrible. He smiled, looked at me and said \"no worries, I got you\" and he returned with bottles of water and a glass of ice. Absolutely fantastic service!"}
{"text":"When I found out they were opening a Cheddars here I got really excited b/c it's one of my favorite restaurants back home. The place was packed for it to be 5:15 in the afternoon. At first, the wait was 30-35mins, but then I went back to back if we could eat out on the patio and were seated right away. Even though the place was packed, the food came out hella quickly which was surprising. I ordered my fav, New Orleans Pasta and it tasted the same as back home...GOOD! It was my coworker's first time trying Cheddar's & she loved it. Which is saying a lot b/c she's picky as hell (She might read this & if so, Hey Girl! *waves*). 

Our server Demera was nice. Her service was prompt and she was engaging. We stayed there, unexpectedly, about 4 hours, & Demera still came over asking if we needed anything & refilled our drinks. Most waitresses would be giving you the evil eye wanting you to get out after you've paid lol. I teased her asking why they raise the price of the croissants here to 3/$2.99 when back home they're 3/1.89 lol. You gotta try the croissants! (I didn't get it this time, but also try the frozen Texas Margarita)

I did order the Monster cookie for the first time and it was a bit too sweet. I probably wouldn't get that again. I'm not much of a sweets eater anyway.

All in all, Cheddar's is a great restaurant with good food and nice portion sizes at a very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"First time here and had the greatest experience. Jordan (corp. Trainer ) was our server and was extremely courteous and friendly. Her suggestions were on point. Over all great food excellent service,  clean restaurant. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Don't waste your time or money, unless you like going somewhere that the staff acts like you should be grateful for their service.  We have been here several times and this was the visit that confirms this place isn't worth another visit.  They took their best employee (bartender) off of the bar, and made him a \"manager\"... The employees all stand around the bar watching the bartender do the work of 6 employees.  What a huge disappointment of a restaurant.... The only positive on our prior visits was the bartender and the food.  The food can't even keep me coming back again as the service is terrible.  If you want to keep your locals returning to your place of business replace your worthless staff."}
{"text":"This place is amazing especially for the price. The waitress never forgot about us even though it was a completely full house. The owner came by fresh, homemade cookies because it was our first time going!"}
{"text":"My family came here for dinner and left pretty satisfied. The food was pretty good and the service was excellent. Our waitress was great about making sure our drinks were filled. One of the great things is that for such large portions of food, the prices are really good. We ordered an appetizer, our two meals, and two desserts, plus non alcoholic drinks and our bill was under $50."}
{"text":"I have to eat my words....The first time we went to cheddars it was AMAZING!!!!! The last 3 times has not been good...we have waiting for over 30 minutes for food....received wrong orders...food not consistent, the food overall has not been good. Each time we go in everything tastes different..Not sure whats going on but not the Cheddars we complimented about previously, and definitely not the same Cheddars as we have experienced in other locations...."}
{"text":"Typical chain restaurant. Not fine dining but there isn't any in gastonia. Expect the normal chain fare. No chefs here"}
{"text":"Love the Monte Cristo Sandwich.  It is enough to share, its huge.  My daughter liked the ribs.  Nice clean restaurant with friendly service.  Very clean and a good diner type food menu.  Prices are also not bad.  I loved the crossiant that came with my cesar salad.  I will return for sure."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing. I don't know if it was because we were so hungry or what, but everything looked and tasted SO good! we got the ribs and fries and the Key West Chicken & Shrimp. We ate outside and it was the perfect ambience and weather (which is so nice for AZ in May) The only thing that was kind of frustrating would be that a few things didn't come out right, and it was very slow, and refills were almost nonexistent. But, I also understand that it's hard when you have a larger party sitting outside and that's it. other than that, I was very impressed for a first time."}
{"text":"Cheddars gives \"comfort\" food a new meaning. Our waiter reeked of marijuana. I was nearly getting a contact high from speaking to him. I guess that would explain the poor service and dull food. Who knows what's going on in the kitchen"}
{"text":"A little late but here it is. We were seated shortly after arriving but our booth seats were dirty although the table was clean.  Other than that our server was polite and attentive to our needs.  Our order was taken promptly and food came out fairly quickly. Food tasted ok : spinach dip, chicken tenders, & baked chicken. The mashed potatoes & broccoli cheese casserole never disappoint but the mac n cheese wasn't that good. The bbq ribs were the star of the night though. Flavorful and meat fell off the bone smoothly."}
{"text":"I was a little leery of trying a new restaurant on a holiday weekend but nevertheless I decided to try this place on Memorial Day for lunch. It was very crowded and busy, yet we were seated in 5 min. I ordered a strawberry margarita & my friend ordered the \"painkiller\". Both were delicious!!!! We ordered the spinach dip appetizer..... Amazing. We both ordered the grilled tilapia/shrimp entree. The entree came with wild rice and 2 sides...I chose broccoli and Mac & cheese. The broccoli was a little mushy, however it was steamed and bright green. Everything exceeded my expectations. So good, my friend ordered another entree to take home to her hubby spur of the moment.  Our waitress was very nice, friendly, helpful.... I will definitely be back and I can't wait."}
{"text":"First off as we entered  the hostess only said how many..no hello, how's your day. nothing, then she brought us to our table dropped the menus down and walked away, (I guess they only text for communication). We ordered our food and when it arrived both of our baked potatoes were cold so the manager walked by and we told him, he told the waitress to bring us 2 more, they arrived still cold hmmmm I see a pattern, asked for a box to take home and cook. The manager walked by again didn't say a word, when we left he was standing at the hostess booth still didn't say a word no thank you for dining with us or how were the potatoes!!! We definitely will not make the trip here again."}
{"text":"Such a great place!!! The food was delicious, but the service was even better! It was our first time so the owner or manager came out to give us a few fresh cookies. I never had a place do that before so it really impressed me! Definitely coming here again, and telling everybody I know to try it out"}
{"text":"Great experience.  Went on mother's day and it was a packed house. Afton (and i hope I remembered it right) was awesome and very attentive to our needs. We will definitely be back with family afain."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Horrible food. Yes, it had to be said twice because it was that bad. My husband hadn't eaten all day and was only able to choke down half of the gray colored jalapeño burger. I was super excited about their baked spagetti. However half way through I started feeling sick to my stomach. Being a vegetarian I asked the waitress again if they had used chicken stock or any meat product. She assured me they hadn't & then told me she hoped my day got better. My response was that my day is fine & I hoped their food got better. Also everything from the bread to the corn was so butter slathered that not even my 4 year old would eat one of her favs, corn. We were also seated next to the door to the patio and had servers going in & out to smoke. When they started seating the patio everyone had to come past or even stand next to our table where 3 people asked me what I was eating.. this was a horrible experience from front to back. If you want to enjoy your dining experience do not go to Cheddar's."}
{"text":"Craving a steak but not craving a $50 meal.  I went to Cheddar's and ordered the Ribeye, baked potato and corn for $16.  Ribeye came out undercooked but they took it back and one more turn on the stove and it was ready.  Thin but very flavorful.  Better than a disappointing Black Angus steak recently.  Baked potato - cold so butter didn't melt.  Corn very tasty.  Meal was cheap but I was missing a salad and bread.  Next time I'll substitute a salad for corn.  Waitress never checked on me after serving and never refilled my glass.  That was a bummer.So good for steak not so good for other stuff."}
{"text":"I love this place. I make it a point to dine here every few weeks. I have never had a bad item off the menu (the Monte Cristo, the grilled salmon, and their queso dip are my legit faves). My son has a couple of food allergies and they are always amazing with it and he has never had an allergy reaction from eating here. I understand food allergies can be a pain but they've always been super accommodating. I've also never had a bad server here. Everyone has been helpful and responsive."}
{"text":"Jen found this place by searching the area using Yelp. We have been trying to try new places and we totally scored with this pick. 

Jen saw they had fried cheese curds which they call Cheddar Bites on the menu and knows I love them. We ordered those and some hand breaded o-rings for apps. $5 for the rings and it was a huge pile the size of my head. The bites were breaded in a crispy Panko like breading and were frickin awesome. Also, they have the good ranch and not the sour cheap stuff. 

Jen ordered New Orelans Pasta and I ordered the hand breaded chicken strips. The breading was flaky and not too thick; just right. The chicken strips were about an inch thick in diameter, juicy, and tender. They were great. Jen's bowl of pasta was enough to feed at least two people. It had shrimp, chicken, and sausage. Jen said it was just ok. I thought the chicken was a little overcooked as it was dry and tough. We both agreed it could have used a little more spice and flavor. 

All of that plus our drinks and our bill was only $42.20. We had leftover equal to the amount we ate; at least. It was a really really good deal for all that we ordered. 

The server Matthew was spot on and we never had to wait long for a refill or extra side of sauce. The booths were big and roomy and the decor was very nice and warming. The menu had a really wide variety from pasta and salads to steak and seafood. Definitely something for everyone and very good prices. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What we loved? Reasonable Price, Tasty food, Great cocktails, ample quantity and beautiful fan :) Which items were best? Grilled Salmon, Onion rings, Cheddar's painkiller, mashed potato, tortilla soup. Which items were ok? cheese fries, steak (little dry), chicken pot pie. Overall - we loved this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is good and so are the prices. I wish that's all I had to say. If you like poor service this is the place to go. If you like being transferred to the bar multiple times to place a to go order this is your place. 

I recently called to place a to go order at night and was immediately transferred to the bar like they usually do. I was on hold for a couple minutes just for someone to answer and greet me again asking what I needed. I explained I still needed to place a to go order. When I finally got the right person to take my order (I'm assuming he bartender) they acted as if I was an I convenience. (We will see how inconvenient I am when I don't leave a tip because of poor service). When I arrive I walk into the bar and ask the bartender why I was transferred twice. The reply: \" well it's busy\" and \"I don't know why the hostess doesn't take your order they have he ability to\". The bar wasn't even busy (unless 3 tables and 2-3 employees in the bar is overwhelming). I was super discouraged by the service I received considering BJ's Brewery has better food and better service for a little higher price and is 2 Min away from the chandler location. But maybe I have to pay to get good service and not expect it at this location. I was told someone was going to reach out to me but that hasn't happened yet. 2 stars because the food tasted good."}
{"text":"I've eaten here quite a few times and we are never disappointed. Great food at reasonable prices. Friendly staff. Good place for family dinner."}
{"text":"This was my husbands and I along with our sons first time dining here. We were given a gift card and chose Cheddars and boy are we glad we did. The food to the service was more than what we expected. Loved every plate we ordered unfortunately we ate a lot of our appetizers that we couldn't finish our meal, but oh well LEFTOVERS!!! 

Any how we were quite impressed and pleased with our waitress Elizabeth here at the chandler location she gave out such great customer service so we hope she gets recognized for that and anyone who's looking to dine here ask for Elizabeth and tip her!!! 

Thank you Cheddars Scratch Kitchen for a 5 Star Service, 

Love the Ustic family."}
{"text":"Service was good food was just okay.  I ordered baby back ribs good flavor but very tough. Just okay food probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I'm still on the fence about this place, it recently opened and it's was busy, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. Decor was great, played good music. BUT! We ordered an appetizer and it came out after our main courses, we had to waved down waiters for drink refills, and food was just ok. Presentation didn't really empress me so I thought the food pick up the slack, not so much. Keep I'm mind there were only two of us to serve. I will come back, strike one cheddars."}
{"text":"Came here on Thursday evening with a couple of my girlfriends to grab a quick bite. We were greeted immediately and headed over to the bar area to eat in the dining booths across from the bar to avoid a long wait. For starters we had two orders of the spinach artichoke dip with nachos, which was pretty good. The nachos were served in a large portion and they were warm. The dip was fresh and creamy. Safe to say we finished both orders before our entrees came out. 

For our entrees we all did the New Orleans Pasta which came with shrimp, chicken and sausages with penne pasta. O.M.G. It was tasty! The chicken, shrimp sausages were all seasoned well and the pasta rich and creamy and not to mention zesty! No wonder why this dish is one of the fan favorites of the establishment. I will most certainly be returning based upon this dish, the dip and the service."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 handmade Texas teas we normally go on sunday with jordan who is awesome but they gave us the premade 
And I said I asked for handmade and she asked the other girl what that was if you are a bartender u should know"}
{"text":"Mom and I went in and had a great lunch.Server Brandon made meal better than expected.His serves was above what one would even expect.Best meal we have had in a long time,no complaints.Food 6,service 9. Ask to be sit in Brandon section."}
{"text":"Pretty good food ..really good prices. Along the lines of a Friday's or Applebees.  Service can be very stetchy at times(alot of the time). Best time to go is Mon-Thurs(better service and hot food)..Weekends are madness(long waits, and sometimes cold food.)  Honey butter rolls are super yum."}
{"text":"A very great experience! We have been here several times and never had a bad experience. Food is plentiful and cheap for how much you get.

Made this review to highlight our server, Nicole. She was professional and quick with everything. Our food came out before the salads, which was odd. However Nicole never gave up on us (which I've had several times at different restaurants). She even comped us a dessert even though we didn't complain.

The managers came by to see us as well. Overall very professional and attentive."}
{"text":"This was my first and my boyfriends second time at a cheddars restaurant. We were both very pleased with the look and feel of the restaurant. Being servers ourselves, we were also pleased with the service and quality of the food. Plate presentation was exceptional and everything was just wonderful. Will definitely be back. 
Btw, Micah was our server and he did a wonderful job. I love the table top name cards, such a great idea! We tried his favorite dish and we could both see why it was his favorite!"}
{"text":"The food here is beyond amazing. Everything is fresh and the flavors are on point. The menu has a good selection of things to choose from. The kids menu also has great healthy choices.  We loved everything we ordered, Philly cheese steak, chicken and shrimp, soup salad & a club and the kids grilled chicken meal. 
The service here however is horrible. We had three adult meals and a kids meal. We got the kids meal after we were done eating our dinner. We asked for ketchup, salt and an extra plate all which we got after we were done eating. Also we ordered corn which we didn't get a spoon to eat it with. 
The manager did come over and take the kids meal off our bill and sent us home with chocolate cake which was nice. 
So good food and nice manager. Service not too hot!!!"}
{"text":"Well.... this makes me sad, but Cheddar's in Charlotte is only getting 2 stars from me and it's solely based on service. I was in town for a meeting and a few of us decided to grab a bite before I left town. Everyone agreed on Cheddar's because we typically enjoy the food and you can't beat the prices. 

We were seated immediately, but we sat in our seat for about 25 minutes before a server came by to introduce themselves or get drink orders. Two members of our party were there before we arrived so that was about 30 minutes. A hostess came by an apologized to us and said she'd have the manager take care of our appetizers for the wait. Later our server came by and he was very nice. He was apologetic, but he didn't have to be. We weren't seated in his section, the hostess asked him to take care of our table. 

The food was good. I usually get the Key West Chicken and Shrimp, but this time I ordered the Mango Talapia with carrots and broccoli casserole. I also had edamame. Everyone at our table was pleased with the food. The group seated behind us encountered the same problem. They hadn't placed drink orders or met their server. The group complained and we shared that we'd just encountered the same issue. Cheddar's was surprisingly over staffed that day. Everywhere you looked there was a server, but apparently the section assignments were wrong. The manager came out to the group seated near us and began to explain as well as help the servers get orders. 

By this time, we'd all finished our food. We were patiently waiting for our bill, while we watched the madness unfold behind us. It took us another 15 minutes to get our bill and the appetizers had not been comped. Everyone was ready to go and paid quickly without even bringing up the promise the hostess made earlier. 

I think the food is always good at Cheddar's, but this is the first time I've experience such poor service with so many servers on staff. Stop by if you have time, seriously, about 2 and half hours is required."}
{"text":"Not horrible, but not awesome.  I guess I should have known better than to order tortilla soup anywhere that is not a Mexican restaurant. But then again, Charleston's has amazing tortilla soup. This was nothing but tomatoes, onions, and little strips of tortilla chips.  Husband had the ribs and said not bad but too burnt on outside. I  thought they were a little dry, but tasty."}
{"text":"Always great food and good drinks.  Prices are excellent.  We have never been disappointed with this restaurant.  Quality and service has always been top notch.  Their ribs and Long Island Iced Tea are the bomb!"}
{"text":"I went here a while ago and it was bad. Years later, I got a free lunch from Cheddars at my job. I ordered the vegetable plate since their vegetarian selection was almost nonexistent, and they failed to explain that their broccoli and cheddar casserole (or whatever it's called) has CHICKEN in it. The other sides that came with my meal tasted worse than frozen meals from the grocery store. Terrible. Edit: was contacted on here by customer service saying they were looking to make things right, but that was almost 2 weeks ago and they never emailed me like they said they would."}
{"text":"I came back this week for lunch again.  The service was great, but I basically ordered a meal that was ready to be plated, the vegetable plate.  I ordered a meal to go.  It was placed on paper in a box.  I went to reheat it the next day and I was eating paper with my meal.  The paper got wet and I tried to peel it from the food before reheating, but it was soaked and I wasn't able to do anything.  Sigh.  You win some, you lose some.  I sure would have enjoyed my to go meal if I didn't have to eat paper!"}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite place, we live within five minutes and visited weekly. Unfortunately we started getting our food to go and have had issues every time. Yesterday evening our final straw was getting half of the normal serving of food. I ordered salmon and rice and ended up cooking dinner after because the serving size was so pathetic. Other issues have been timeliness and forgetting portions of our orders.
Anyhow I will say we had no issues when dining in."}
{"text":"Sooooo this is my 3rd time coming to this specific Cheddars location. The first time my hubby and i grabbed a quick meal at a table top in the bar. Above was ok but the food was consistent with our numerous experiences.  

The second time we came on a Friday night with our 3 children.  It was obvious it had been an extremely busy evening as the tables weren't bussed throughout the restaurant. There was a line through the door.  Staff were leaving on the hostess stand.  So we left.  

Here I am for a third visit. To celebrate my daughter's 11th birthday. The line is out the door. Tables are empty through every dining room.  Im told it will be a 35-40 minute wait as they're short on silverware.  Huh?   How do you run out of silverware at a chain restaurant. So like an idiot i ask the question expecting a reasonable answer....\"The roller came late.\"  I couldn't help but continue down this path.  I ask,  \"What is a roller?\"  She responds confidently,  \"The person that rolls the silverware came to work late.\"  Now I'm officially annoyed.  Are you kidding me.  If the silverware is clean seat me and the other people that's waiting.  Bring us clean unrolled silverware.  If management can't handle a single person arriving at work late and roll the silverware then they have huge problems.  This location is not typical.  I'm so annoyed and still waiting for a table.  That silverware better be perfect and beautifully rolled. Ugh....... It's my kids choice for her birthday. MERCY ME! !!"}
{"text":"Went there this past weekend with the wife, the food was amazing. We ordered Spinach Dip, CF Steak and the Spaghetti Lasagna (Spagna on the menu I believe) it was so delicious! Definitely worth going back on our next trip to phoenix!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here, the food is amazing along with the service. Went last night on a Saturday and it was packed. Asked how long of a wait and was quoted five to ten minutes. Was seated within that time frame. I'm honestly writing this for the waiter we had. He was great. Very prompt and on point with everything from taking orders to dropping off drinks from the bar to refilling beverages. I wish I remembered his name. Despite how busy it was, he was constantly checking his tables and doing a wonderful job. Just wish I could remember his name to give him the credit he deserves."}
{"text":"For what this place is, it was great :) this review is mostly for DeAndre because he was one of the best servers we have had! He was super nice and very attentive. We tried to let a manager know at the end but he was tied up in the kitchen (which is probably why the food was great too!) so we just wanted to put our compliments out there! If we go again we will definitely request DeAndre!"}
{"text":"I tried to get a to go order recently and it took nearly 35 mins, when I was told it would be 5 - 10. Every single time I get to go there is a problem. The food is good and some of the people working there are sweet but the customer service is just not great. Or even good. Sadly I do not think we will be ever going back because of this last experience."}
{"text":"Great place for a large group with various tastes.   Excellent food and great atmosphere.  Service is also very good."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Cheddar's for a special dinner. I had the half rack of baby back ribs and chicken tenders. My sides were the mac and cheese and southern green beans. I was so full with half the entree that I couldn't even eat the ribs. Had to take it home in a box. The tenders were exceptional, the southern beans were very good but the mac and cheese would have been better if it had been hotter. My wife's dinner was steak, chicken tenders, coleslaw and fries. She said the steak was very good. We also had an appetizer of chips and salsa. The cheese dip was very tasty. For the money and taste this is one of the best places to eat. Definitely a special place"}
{"text":"I would say the prices are absolutely reasonable for this amaaaazing food. Best scratch kitchen of all time, this food is simply delicious. I would definitely come here all the time if I lived closer. 5 stars, no doubt about it!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but the service was slooww. 

20 mins for someone to take our drink order
45 mins before we received our appetizer
1 hr before we received our meal

That slow and we arrived at the restaurant at 3:30pm.
Can't imagine what it would be like at 6 or 7.
Not a great experience for my first time there."}
{"text":"We decided to go early on Sunday night @ 4:30 pm to avoid the busy hours.  Ordered onion rings before our meal, then our meal order.  All the food came out at the same time.  Greasy onion rings sitting in a pool, battered fish that was mostly mushing coating of bready dough and the white fish that was too salty to finish.

We left our food on the plates and called over the server. She gave us the bill and stood over me while I signed and place tip on ticket.  Server was a little too friendly by sitting down with us at the table.

might consider a lunch there (sandwich only), but dinner is out."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. The menus, when handed to us, were sticky & filthy. Gross. The place smelled. One person in our group found a hair in his food. Another person was charged for an item she didn't order. Will not go back."}
{"text":"We've been there several times now and I have to say the food is pretty good. Management and staff are all very friendly. Overall, from the quality of food, service and value for the money standpoint, I definitely recommend Cheddars."}
{"text":"I have eaten the buffalo wrap, grilled catfish, club sandwich and chicken tenders. The food is always good but the service is hit or miss. The last time I went there, the waitress shorted me a dollar and brought out the wrong topping for my potato. Overall, good food for cheap but take some patience and keep an eye on the staff."}
{"text":"Not the place to go if you eat gluten free. HORRIBLY limited options. I finally picked something from the limited menu only to find something that looked like soft plastic (maybe a glove, plastic wrap...im not even sure) in my food. The waitress and manager on duty did nothing to remedy this. I paid for the meal

At the end of the meal they brought a couple cookies to the table as we were celebrating my moms birthday. They were awful. 

Needless to say we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Couldn't decide on what to get with my coworkers so when in doubt we headed here to Cheddar's.

They offer a selection of half items for lunch that u can combine. We all decided to go with the full meal and it was clear when one persons Monte Cristo & fries came out that they should of just got the lunch size!!! 

I went with the scratch bacon cheeseburger, one went with the Monte Cristo as mentioned and ten the other went with the Philly Cheesesteak. 

Overall good came out quick and was well prepared. Nothing really blew us out of the water so it was 'okay'. I like my burger medium and it was pretty cooked but then realized I didn't get an option (which is not uncommon). I decided to indulge with a soda but the Coke seemed flat and not to my liking. Good 'no brained' lunch place if you are trying to accommodate a group of indecisive people."}
{"text":"Well if I go back I will deserve the same CRAP! My husband and I took our daughter and three grandkids.  Usually the grandkids will eat anything, this time not so much. Took FOREVER to get the food had to beg for water, WATER!  We asked at the outset if they were busy and was told no, it's a slow night. So what the ?????  Finally get the bill and it was wrong, we were overcharged but not too much so we let it ride and got out of there. Felt like screaming!  $70. for cold food that took forever to get there. Never again!"}
{"text":"I have to say the last time I came here I absolutely loved it. The food was good, the atmosphere was fine. This time I went with my family for my birthday. Our waitress (can't remember her name) spoke so low we could barely hear her. She looked as if she didn't have a care to even be there working. She never told us the specials, didn't try to sell us appetizers and failed to refill our drinks throughout the night. On two occasions she brought us FLAT sodas. My cosmopolitan was extremely over poured and disgusting. I took the drink to the bar and politely asked if I could get another one to replace mine. The bartender replied to another coworker saying, \"can you make this girl another drink because obviously I don't know how to pour.\" Seriously? On top of all of this, this waitresses section we were in was disgusting. It was dirty, floors slippery, food all over the place. I cannot say how nasty it was. Our food was cold, and dry. Sort of like it sat on the counter for a while. I will not return to this place! If I could give it 0 stars I would! Don't waste your money here unless you want ghetto, slow service."}
{"text":"We had no idea what this place was and went with absolutely no expectations. We were pleasantly surprised! We were seated fairly quickly for a Saturday night and everyone was so nice! 
Our server was awesome, kept our drinks filled at all times, gave great recommendations, and was basically just on the top of his game. My baby was a bit fussy and servers, bussers, and even a manager stopped by just to say hi to her. The service was seriously the best! 
And holy crap the prices... we were very surprised at how decently priced everything was! The food wasn't \"out of this word\" or anything, but it was pretty yummy! 
We ordered the Santa Fe spinach dip as a starter and then I got the chicken pot pie and my husband got ribs and chicken tenders. The portions were huge and we went home with a lot of leftovers! Then the manager came over and said welcome to cheddars(since it was our first time) and brought us freshly baked cookies for free! It was awesome!
Anyway, we left SUPER full and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I like Cheddar's because they have a veggie plate on the menu which allows you to creat your own. Thanks for that, no doubt.  $6.99 can't beat that either. Most folks that I have eaten with feel the same about the meat dishes. So stop in and enjoy a good meal with friendly staff. 

Peace 

*only reason it's not a 5 star is it seams most restaurants serve warm/almost cold bake potatoes"}
{"text":"The name does not match the place... AT ALL.
The atmosphere of the restaurant was great. Very laidback but still looks fancy, so it fits any type of occassion.

I went here a couple of nights ago just to get a meal with my bf. The food was very cheap. We got 2 entrees, 2 cocktails and an app for $40. But quality it was all right. Not memorable. And we love going to local places, so dont be fooled this is a chain. A small chain but still a chain throughout the USA.

We ordered a lot of food and the portion sizes are huge. So if you are into that - big plus.

Most memorable part of the meal - cheese curds and mac and cheese side.
4 stars for the atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of most chain restaurants but Cheddar's is actually pretty good.  Cheddar's is family oriented and entertaining for children which is great because I know they can get antsy when kept waiting.  Cheddar's has a huge paddlewheel fan in the middle of the restaurant that looks like some kind of Orwellian/Da Vinci contraption and a massive saltwater aquarium that even I think is super cool to look at.

The service has been good in my experience and the food is decent too.  One thing that really stands out on the menue is the chicken strips/fingers.  I honestly think that Cheddar's may take the number one spot in all of Charlotte for this particular dish.  The meat is very tender and juicy.  You actually get whole chicken strips with crispy breading (not fraken chicken like a McNugget) .  The portion you get is just massive; and I am lucky if I can get a third of the way though most times.

A good tip:  If you take the chicken strips home because you can not eat them all, try broiling them when reheating.  Broiling will keep them crispy and heat them through all the way.  Just don't go too high on the temp. or take your eye off of them or they will burn."}
{"text":"First date and first time at Cheddars. Wouldn't have been my first choice, but finding a guy who will plan a decent date is rare these days. There was a wait mid day on a Saturday, which surprised me. Fortunately, there were enough televisions in the bar area that I could watch my Tar Heels while I ate and made small talk. 

I ordered spinach dip and the cajun pasta. The spinach dip was pretty good, especially since I was hungry. Their chips were homemade. The dip was a creamier version with a dollop of sour cream.

My pasta was decent. I didn't like the sausage that was in it wasn't andouille. It was more of a breakfast sausage and they were in big chunks. The shrimp were great, blackened, and with the tail on. There were only three. If I had to do it over again, I'd substitute all meat for shrimp. The pasta was average with a sauce that was forgettable. If I go back to Cheddar's I'll probably choose something else."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Cheddar's in about ten years, with the last one I visited being in San Angelo, TX. I remember the food being bar-ish, with no real interesting sway working for or against my palette. So to my surprise, this Cheddar's food was very good.

The appetizer we ordered was the Spinach Dip. It was good... Served SUPER fast (literally, we ordered it, had a few sentences of conversation, and it was delivered from the back). It got to our table so fast, we both paused in disbelief and said \"whoa\". The dip itself was a bit full of spinach, but arguably, it's called \"Spinach Dip\" not \"Cream with a little hint of spinach\". This was a welcomed change to the appetizer and it was 4.5 stars. The chips provided with the dip were delicious - thin, warm, crispy, and fresh tasting - not stale from sitting under a heat lamp like some other restaurants. We didn't have enough chips to cover the dip, but I'll explain more on that later. 

I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak sub Steamed Brocolli instead of green beans, and my girlfriend got the Grilled Baja Chicken as described in the menu. The portion for the Chicken Fried Steak was abundant, and the way it was prepared was great. The crust on the CFS was golden, flaky, and flavorful without being overly heavy in battered flavor... I think it might have been a light egg-wash and flour mixture... whatever it was, it was perfect. The actual meat of the CFS was perfect, not too dry, not too greasy from the frying process. And it was piping hot. The white gravy that was on the CFS and garlic-mashed potatoes was fantastic, as well... I actually wish they had given me more, but found that the meal was still fantastic without it. The garlic-mashed potatoes were also great... from scratch, with some of the skin still apparent, just like my grandmother used to make.

I tried the dish my girlfriend had, the Grilled Baja Chicken from the \"Lighter Side\" part of the menu; this was on point, as well. For a Baja-described dish, I was expecting it to taste heavy, like it would hit my stomach like most spanish-american inspired meals often do because of the heavy amounts of oils in the food. This was not the case at all. The chicken was light and flavorful, with the right amount of spices to bring out the flavor of the savory, juicy chicken, without burying it to the point that you can't taste the rest of your food. The black beans were a nice touch and melded well in the mouth with the chicken and the rice.Very well done, indeed. 5 Stars

For dessert, we ordered the Peach Cobbler. It was warm and gooey, while the caramel drizzled vanilla ice cream was cold and perched on top... I was pretty full from eating just half of the Chicken Fried Steak meal, but we managed to eat most of the dessert and it was wonderful! It came out super fast, and was a great ending to our meal.

Now the one thing that stood out above everything else was the service. We had \"Juste\" (pronounced \"yoo-stuh\") as our server. It was fantastic all around. She never let our drinks dip below half-way before automatically refilling them, without us having to flag her down from across the restaurant or catch her as she was flying by. As the chips to our appetizer were getting low, she brought us a hot refill of chips without us even mentioning it. Our waters were instantly replaced at half-way... Juste worked stealthily, allowing my girlfriend and I a chance to carry on a good conversation without worrying about our drinks being low. She was fast on everything; everytime she asked if we needed something, if we made a request, it was immediately fulfilled, without waiting for her to go around to the entire restaurant to save herself trips to the kitchen. That made a huge difference in service time for us and we thank her tremendously for that. She was also smiling and seemed to enjoy being there, which made for an instant pleasantry while she was engaging us to fulfill her duties. Her service was so good that we felt compelled to tell the manager about our positive experience. If we could give her 1000 stars, we most certainly would.

Having read some of the other recent reviews, I find myself wondering if we were just super lucky tonight... did the planets align? I don't believe in that nonsense... I attribute our fantastic dining experience to Juste's impeccable serving abilities - making sure our orders were right, delivered fast, and that our table was never left waiting for anything at any moment. It is thanks to her that we will most definitely be returning again. We HIGHLY recommend this Cheddar's - if their entire serving staff performs as well as Juste, this restaurant will never disappoint you."}
{"text":"If you go here, be sure you are hungry. The portions are HUGE. I only made it through half of my meal! It was quite delicious though. Our server was super-friendly and helpful.  He suggested that we all try their croissants and I am glad we did - they were sweetened with honey and dripping with butter. Tons of calories, but oh so delicious! My one complaint was that we weren't presented with a drink menu. In fact, there was no alcohol mentioned on the menu at all, so I thought it was soda/tea only. Only when I went tot he bathroom did I realize that the place had a bar! Oh well, I think I had enough to eat without putting a beer on top of everything. ;) You should definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"A restaurant named Cheddar's and the waitress can't discern between American and Cheddar cheese. That's pretty sad. And so they can't make a burger right and now I don't get to eat lunch. To make things worse it has taken 11 minutes for her to cash me out. Walked by and looked at my credit card sitting atop the check 3 times! And still didn't take it. What kind of tip do you think she got?"}
{"text":"Good company, great food - That's how you KNOW God is good! Ha! It's going down. #LUNCH."}
{"text":"Had my second visit here 11-11-14. Quality food. Casual dinning. Will be a new go to good food spot.  Inside is nice, seems a bit too dark. Full bar with a cool fish tank. Chicken tenders and ribs combo very good. Definitely recommend to try!"}
{"text":"We tried this place for the very first time today, and honestly it was great! Everything from when we opened the front door to leaving was amazing! The food is delicious, we each had a bone in ribeye and sides and from that first bite we knew we'd make this drive (about 30 minutes from home) for this place! The fresh flavor teas and lemonades are perfect! Love this place!"}
{"text":"So I get a call from the general manager at from Cheddars...what another total waste of my time! The first conversation was typical, trying to locate our ticket & find out who our server was...after he locates the ticket he calls me back to say he found it & confirm that they did run out of the pain killer drink && give more excuses as to why...at the end of the conversation I concluded that not only do they employ incompetent servers, but the general manager as well. I guess when you have a general manager that lacks decent communication skills that one would need as a general manager, it is pretty impossible to coach/train decent servrs.. Here's a little piece of advise that I'm offering as a regional trainer (I train new managers) whenever you have an unsatisfied customer if you don't have any intentions of apologizing, and being accountable don't bother contacting them! Accept the bad review and keep it moving. For Adam to contact me and reiterate what his server said about then running out of popular menu items because he hasn't figured out a successful way to order inventory yet is laughable yet annoying all together! I really wish I could give this place -5 stars!"}
{"text":"Went in at 9pm. Place was a ghost town.  Orderd a steak and spin dip. Quality of steak was comparable to waffle house,  the dip was soggy, and service was poor at best.
Second time trying this restaurant and still don't have anything nice to say about it."}
{"text":"This cheddars is AWFUL. We waited 2 hours to be seated and longer to eat and Eben longer to get our check. Then the checks weren't right. Hell, I'm waiting on the check as I write this! I will never! Horrible service. They mean well but they need to get it together."}
{"text":"Food was delicious but, the service was sluggish. I had the shrimp and chips and they were perfectly cooked. I'm sure as time goes by the service will strive. Jeff (GM) took care of my appetizer as they brought my queso dip with meat, as i asked for it with no meat. I'd definately go back."}
{"text":"Food is really good here. The chicken tenders, loaded fries, cheese curds, and potato skins are great appetizers. The Spasagna is my favorite dish but I also like the Philly cheesesteak."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic, the same as the other Cheddar's I'm used to in Texas, but for some reason this restaurant is extremely noisy.  When I mean noisy, I mean louder than many bars near ASU.  If you don't mind that then head here, but if you want to have a conservation with someone or just need a quit place to eat and relax this place is not it."}
{"text":"Great for a quick lunch, especially if you sit in the bar. Menu is gigantic. Portion sizes are extremely generous, even on the lunch items."}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's 21st birthday. Although the wait was long, the experience was a great one. Our server, Alex, was funny, sweet, and made the experience a great one for my friends and me. Her customer service skills made it easy to forget how long we waited. She was pretty much an all around great server. The food was surprisingly affordable and it seemed to be a great family environment as well. Definitely recommend coming here"}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS!!!! The food here was quite delicious, I don't know if I was very hungry or the food was prepared with thoughtfulness. I think it was the latter. I am familiar with this chain because my hometown has one and I love it. The service was ok, it could have been better but the food did make up for it. I ordered steak and ribs. The steak needed no other sauces other than what it was cooked in and the ribs were so meaty. I couldn't devour them fast enough. I ordered broccoli as well and it was delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed this meal. I wonder do they cook this good every day or was it just a good day to visit. Either way I can't rave enough about my food. The waiter wasn't as attentive as he could be but it wasn't a big problem. If I lived in Charlotte I could see me eating here quite often. It's a win-win situation, you get good food and at a great price!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service. We had numerous things on the menu that were yummy: onion rings, loaded mashed potatoes, french fries, Ceasar salad and chicken pot pie were most notable. Portions are big and are shareable.  Would recommend for a family dinner because there's something for everyone!"}
{"text":"Will always return when in the Phoenix area. The food was delicious and very reasonably priced. The service was also impeccable."}
{"text":"The restaurant has that perfect mix of great food, casual atmosphere and friendly fast service. Nice enough for a date yet quick enough for a lunch break. Can't miss on the chips and queso, chicken tenders and baked spasanga! Great place to eat."}
{"text":"Decent comfort food, can be a bit expensive. Their chicken tenders are a bit too greasy for me although they are very popular and generous portions."}
{"text":"Probably the worst service overall I've ever had. Over 15 minutes to get our drinks from the bar. The tables near us both got their entrées before they even had glasses of water. Had to ask for silverware after our food came because we were never given any. Food came out without gravy even though we asked for it. We were offered plastic silverware because our server didn't want to go 10 extra steps to get regular silverware. Server never checked on us, never offered a second round of drinks. I'll probably never go back here."}
{"text":"This place has wonderful food. I've eaten here twice with my six year old son, who is a picky eater and he always loves what he gets. The device has been great each time and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and I am already a fan. The bourbon grilled salmon was very good and so were my husband's fish and chips.
Nice looking restaurant with outdoor patio and our server Andrea was so friendly and knowledgable of the menu that made this first experience great and wanting to come back!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Good atmosphere excellent wait staff and the food was good.  We had the nachos which was a monster plate of that we couldn't finish.  Also I had the philly steak sandwich which was really big as well.  Soft hoagie roll and lots of meat and cheeses I it was fantastic.   Recommended for lunch."}
{"text":"It is so hard to find a restaurant that serves a Monte Cristo.  It was a very good Sandwich and The loaded baked potato soup was delicious.  The inside of the restaurant was very nice, a bit dark, but still very nice.  I would dine here again."}
{"text":"This is my first time ever writing a review for a restaurant and I go out to eat way more often than I should. I first found out about this place about this time last year when I went out to dinner with my aunt and her husband. Since that first visit, I have been hooked and try to go about once a month or so with my boyfriend. My boyfriend and I have even recommended this place to our friends and coworkers who have gone out and tried this place multiple times as well. 

So by this point, I have tried a lot of the items off of their menu and definitely have a few favorites. By far, the honey butter croissants are the best item on the menu. I order them every single time and crave them constantly. The stacked nachos are also a favorite of my boyfriend and mine, as we have tried nachos at many, many other places and nothing quite lives up to Cheddar's. The broccoli cheese casserole is also to die for and the steaks are well-seasoned and always come out cooked exactly as I like/order. I've tried a lot of their pastas and they are not bad, but however, not as good as their other items. My boyfriend really likes their burgers and their Philly cheesesteak. 

I know this review is really long, but hang in there. My boyfriend and I are both fairly young (we turned 20 this year) and since young couples are notorious for being bad tippers, we often get poor service whenever we go out to eat. However, at Cheddar's the service has always been excellent and one server in particular has started to recognize us and is always very kind and makes our dining experience memorable each and every time. 

So, in short, the food is great. Certain items on the menu are better than others, so if you have one experience that isn't all that great, give them another try! The service has always been spectacular as well, regardless of who is waiting on us."}
{"text":"My family had lunch to celebrate birthdays. We heard how wonderful the chicken tenders and fish & chips were. There were 21 of us in our party. Out of the 21, 10 got food poisoning. When we contacted the restaurant by phone, we were blown off and only told they would talk to the kitchen. Four of us sent emails to them with no response back. We had very good service from the wait staff, but the customer service we have received after the incident has been horrible. To not be acknowledged or given a response was bad customer service. An apology is all we were looking for. Our family will never eat there again and we won't be referring anyone either."}
{"text":"I don't think I have one bad thing to say about this. Food was great! Fresh! And the prices were awesome. 

Atmosphere was great to, for any occasion."}
{"text":"I want to like this restaurant. The 3rd time my BF and I visited was this afternoon. We received a coupon for chicken fingers in the mail so we thought we would try again. Since I think it will take too long to explain the 3 visits we've made I'll summarize the pros and cons below:

Pros: 
* Great breading on chicken strips
* Good drinks
* Fresh food 
* Fish was cooked well

Cons:
* Literally had portion of a butter stick wrapper in my corn on one visit
* My BF witnessed a waiter drop knife on floor then pick up and put back on someone's plate (today 6/11/17)
* Timeliness is questionable (sometimes we had service when we wanted, other times we've had to wait to grab someone walking by)
* Inconsistency in food quality. Really loved onion rings once, but ordered fries with my meal and found them soggy and old. Seemed unusual since this was during the same visit.
* Staff seems plentiful yet no one appears to want to work there. No one has been particularly cheerful or knowledgeable in my 3 visits. 

The bartender told us today that it had been very busy and everyone was there to redeem the chicken fingers coupons. She mentioned that the marketing clearly had worked but she was pointing out how they were unprepared to handle the onslaught of customers. 

We witnessed several employees hanging out at the side bar picking up drinks etc, but it seemed slightly unprofessional to see a presumed cook staring at the bartender's butt while waiting for his personal order to come up. Also, to see so many employees standing around, presumably waiting for drink orders. I know there were tables to be cleared and waters to be freshened.

I am not a F&B professional, but I do know that something is going wrong here and it appears to be staff. If I ask what to order between 2 dishes, I appreciate more than just a, \"well, they're both good\"-type answer. 

Maybe the issue is with management but clearly the staff is lacking. Their numbers are great but their skills are limited. 

I want to like this place. Please tell me why I should ever try again."}
{"text":"One item all should order at least once for brunch or early dinner, Monte Cristo.  It's a little too much food but is a great left-over or the next morning or late night.  Great service and the food was served hot."}
{"text":"First time at this location and last.  Food presentation is horrible and manager is obviously not in the right profession.  If I could give this establishment zero ratings I would. So disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"We heard good reviews from people and I was thinking this was similar to Texas Roadhouse, etc (which is nasty).. 

We got tips from ppl that the Mac n Cheese was off the hook.... Well, not so much,, actually closer to the same as say KFC... we even ordered 2 servings thinking it would be so great.. 

Beer battered Fish... Very good, and not over oily.. nice flavors. 
1/2 Rack Ribs ... great flavor, and a little overcooked, but that worked out so you can uses a fork n eat without getting overly messy. 
Grilled Shrimp - had an off taste, definitely over cooked as well, but was edible. 
Broccoli Cheese Casserole was actually VERY good, could almost eat that as a main dish.. 


Not quite what we expected, but will be back periodically., 
** bartender wasn't too attentive, we usually sit at the bar to get better service,"}
{"text":"We love the food here, fresh and yummy. Good portion and reasonable price. One of my favorite restaurants in the hood."}
{"text":"This place use to be good, but now they don't have any non carb options on their light menu and won't make exceptions. Is it really worth losing a customer over a side of vegetables?"}
{"text":"Third visit today since this place opened.  The decor is fantastic and that's all I have nice to say.  The hostess staff is rude, insolent, self absorbed and untrained.  Three times I have had to deal with an obviously overwhelmed young girl with a waiting list, waiting disks and asking names.  Let alone figuring out how to instruct the seater where to take a party.  I understand long waits and long lines and am very patient but not a rude hostess who acts like if another person walks through the door to eat at this restaurant, she will be leaving.  My husband enjoys the short and tight skirts on the hostess staff though.  Today's visit was no better to start.  I really felt like I interrupted a private conversation asking for a table for three.  

When we were seated, apparently the server had been triple seated and argued with the hostess right in front of us.  Truly.  I felt like I should go elsewhere.  Anyway, after a lot of excuses ahead of time why she won't be with us quickly and why our food won't arrive quickly we finally were served.

I ordered the fish and chips and the batter was raw inside and fries were cold.  Not much more I can say.

The manager did come by when the server noticed I didn't eat the food and he did take that plate off the bill but I can truly say, third time was NOT a charm.  I'll be going back much later when they get more experience and time under their belt.

For now, 1 star.  I'm hoping I'm wrong."}
{"text":"A lot of people seem to like this place. I work at Wells Fargo down the street, and we came here for a team lunch outing a couple months ago.  It didn't do much for me, but my coworkers liked it.

If I want cheap food, I'd rather just go to Taco Mac down the road. I feel like the quality is a little bit better. Not terrible though."}
{"text":"Tucson location, most days the food is fairly decent.  The problem is with their coffee.  It's instant; it's Nescafe.  I am a person who loves her coffee; it is the beginning, middle, and end of my meal.  Cheddar's is a \"from scratch\" restaurant, so where is the fresh brewed coffee that I so desperately long for?  Right now, it's at the Starbucks just down the block."}
{"text":"Went on a busy Saturday night and expected a crowd. There was a huge crowd but we were there for a birthday dinner so we decided to stick it out. We had a group of ten and waited from 6:20 to 7:50 to get seated. When we were seated we got placed at separate tables. Not fun for the birthday girl to have to step back and forth from table to table to see her friends. They said that the large table they had for large groups had been occupied for about 2 hours and the folks weren't leaving. 

The menu has been updated (and i didn't grab a picture) and they have literally everything. Definitely something for everyone on the menu. I went with the favorites section and got the New Orleans pasta. Large portion and very tasty. The frozen drinks that were on special were also good. 

Our waitresses initially fought over who got what table because of the tip I guess? I mean they confronted each other right there in front of us. But the service we received was subpar. Numerous times we were without drinks or forgotten items. I asked for waters at one point and she came back with just one glass for me since I asked when 3 other people had empty glasses. At other times we would just see them all hanging out backs on the wall with managers right there! Confusing when the restaurant was so busy. Wasn't a bad time but I'll stick to other restaurants in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined there about a month ago. The service for us was ok, but three tables around us were complaining about something or another through our meal. The food was ok, prices decent, service ok. The mixed drink I ordered was very good, but warning people with \"we care about you so you can only order two\" seems low-class.  

I think Cheddar's will always be about 2.5-3 stars no matter what they do. It's 'ok'"}
{"text":"That first visit had us rocketing back for more.  We've been back for a total of 4 visits, and it's less good every time.  They seem to have a genuine problem serving hot food that's actually hot."}
{"text":"This place is on my list of \"do not go again\" the food was not good. The service was slow. I've heard great things but none of what I actually experienced."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I missed the yelp meeting where things went to hell in a hand basket...LOL

The wait staff is a bit slow,  but  the food is good.  I've haven't had too many disappointments eating here.  It's nice for the nights you don't feel like cooking.

I recommend the spasagna or whatever they call it...it's basically ooey gooey spaghetti/lasagna combo."}
{"text":"I Love Cheddar's. Its a good family friendly casual dining restaurant. Food and Drink prices are very reasonable and the portion sizes are what really gives you a bang for bucks"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a very good dinner with my mother and niece and nephew. This place is great food is cooked when you order from scratch. Our server was very attentive to our needs the place was slightly busy but you wouldn't know it by the service that she provided. If you have the chance to stop by don't pass on this place."}
{"text":"The salmon was very good, the corn was buttery and the croissants were yummy!! The chicken strips were flavorful & tender. The coleslaw was a little bland. The hostess was less than friendly but our waitress's friendly, professional manner made up for hostess's coldness. I will go there again."}
{"text":"I came here with my 2 little ones on a busy Saturday afternoon and was pleasantly surprised after being called to be seated after waiting 2 minutes when we were initially told that there was a 20 minute wait. The food came fast and the portions were good. The prices are very low too. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had a cute and cheerful server named Maggie. She was very helpful and checked in on us the right amount. We never had an empty glass she was I really a great waitress. The stacked nachos we had were delicious and I split it with my sister. They are super huge, you will be stuffed. The one sad part is that they don't do anything for birthdays. We had desert anyways and ordered the monster cookie. I could do with out the maraschino cherry, it was overall delicious."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is amazing! We randomly came across it driving and we fell in love! The pork chop is TO. DIE. FOR. I would definitely recommend that with the Cheddar Painkiller :) Karissa was our waitress and she totally made our night even more enjoyable. Such a positive and friendly staff."}
{"text":"OMG, Cheddars is finally in Arizona!!!! I can't believe it!!!! When I left Texas in 2012, I never thought I'd see one, and I drove by before it opened and couldn't wait to go in! It's just as I remembered it in Texas. The spinach and artichoke dip is my favorite appetizer. If you're into salads, theirs are really good - especially since they are served with a croissant that's been topped with melted honey butter. Yum. Their chicken strips are good; my favorite dishes are the New Orleans pasta and the lemon pepper chicken. I've also had (at another location) their chicken fried steak and chicken fried chicken.  Yum. My only advice:  if you leave hungry, it's your own fault because they don't skimp on the portion sizes. I read a review that said if you're thinking expensive, don't. One person can eat for under $10, easily. Try it all. I haven't had anything bad there. All the locations are pretty similar as far as quality and taste.  Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Well the experience started out by being seated in the bar without informing us. Then they brought us our 3 dishes which 2 were incorrect (fault of the server) and 1 had to be remade. We kept the other dish. The food was good but the server had an attitude and felt it necessary to try to prove herself correct."}
{"text":"The service in the place is absolutely horrid. We have been to this resturant several times since it has opened and the quality of service has gone down tremendously. Tonight, we literally had 0 service, the waitress took forever to get to our table. We she did show up, we went ahead and ordered. She brought our drinks and salads out. That was about the last we saw of her. We got our food and my wife asked for ketchup for her fries, a different waitress had brought out our food and said she would bring some back. She never did and I ended up swiping a bottle from the table accross from us. We ran out of drinks close to the end of our meal with countless servers, hostesses, and even the manager walking by and they did not even acknowledge that fact or offer refills. 

The food was good, I had the baked Spazana which was good and my wife had the Buffalo wrappers. She orders the wrappers with out buffalo as she doesn't like real spicy stuff. They put the Buffalo on it anyway but we never were able to send it back as the waitress was non existant.

When she finally did come by, my wife told her about the wrappers and she apologized and went to get us the check and to-go drinks (they were our first refills). She brought this back and I laid my card down in the tray just happy to be getting out of there. A different manager came by and asked about our food. My wife told here about the food, she apologized and adjusted my bill so that I just paid for my meal which was real nice.

Overall, the food on this place has always been very good but the service is horrible!!! With as much staff as they have moving around that place you would think that they would be on top of everything but they are not. Management is severely lacking and the one that took care of the bill tonight is the only one that I have seen so far that has cared or made an effort which I applaud. Tonight will probably be my last visit to Cheddars until they get there service issues under control."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised how good this place was. I kinda figured it was going to be a place for the older crowd kinda cheesy but it was actually pretty nice inside. 
The hostess didn't impress me because she didn't bother asking for my name or greeting me. Just asked \"how many?\" And gave me a beeper. Once it went off, she just yelled party of 2!? It would have been better if she had said my name. I dunno. One of those things. 
Our server was great! I thought the idea of having the card with some info about our server like their fav entree was a cool touch. Something I hadn't seen before  
We ordered the small bacon cheese fries and cheese curds for apps. Omg sooo much bacon on the fries. They did not skimp. The cheese curds were great, they had a light panko crust on them that made them super crispy. 
Meal wise my husband had the ribs and chicken tenders. I had the mango salsa tilapia and  shrimp. Ribs were tender and tasty and chicken tenders were sooo good. They had a light batter on them and were not greasy. It's funny because I wouldn't think of ordering them but they were really good.  
My mango salsa tilapia was super tasty. Seasoning was just right. I had a side of Broccoli and Mac n cheese. Broccoli was bland but it was steamed broccoli so can't say that wasn't expected. But mixed it in with the Mac n cheese and it was great lol. 

Overall this place was very good. Service was great.
Not at all what I had expected. Pricing is very very reasonable. Burgers for $6!! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I liked this place so much I visited twice in the same day. For lunch, I had a buffalo chicken wrap in a sun dried tomato tortilla. Plus, I had chicken tortilla soup with corn tortilla strips and a ceasar salad that had a tasty crossiant with it.  Later, I returned for dinner.  I ordered a house salad with ranch dressing. Plus, I ordered a chicken pot pie.  I thought the chicken pot pie was delicious.  I looked to see if this restaurant had any other locations because this one is so far away.  I wish there was a location in Glendale, AZ.  I would be a frequent diner.  Unfortunately, there is only one in Tucson.  They have great prices and both of my servers provided great service."}
{"text":"Ehhhh, I was not impressed with this restaurant at all. This was my first visit to a Cheddar's and I was uninspired with the menu right off the bat. I ordered the drink special Fireball Sangria and it was not good. Not anything I will order again anywhere. We ordered the chips and queso for an app and here is strike 2. Cheese dip was a nacho style and I prefer the white cheese dips. Chips were not fresh tasting either. I had trouble picking an item for an entree so I finally just settled on the Sweet Heat Chicken and Shrimp with a garden salad and an extra side of Mac and cheese. The Shrimp were pretty tasty but the chicken breast tasted like propane gas, so I did not eat much of it at all. Sweet Heat glaze was tasty but too runny to stay on chicken or shrimp so my rice ended up floating in it. Therefore, I did little more than taste the rice. Not a fan of sweet rice. The side of Mac and cheese was the final blow! It was cold and bland, the cheese did have much flavor and the dish was quite thick and dry due to the heavy breadcrumb topping. I'm not sure I'll ever give Cheddar's another chance. Decor was nice but our booth and table were dirty, we had to ask waiter to clean it off before we ordered. Waiter was fair. He kept complaining about being overworked so we kept our requests to a minimum. My daughter ordered the chicken Alfredo and she was pleased. She likes Cheddar's and has visited many times in the Charlotte area. This just wasn't an experience I'm in a rush to repeat!"}
{"text":"When you down go by this place for a pick me up. The PainKiller is my favorite drink. One of my favorite places as well. I had the Dijon Chicken with rice,broccoli,abd mashed potatoes. Yeap two starces i know lol.. Great place. A little cold st times service is friendly. It was a Friday night so a little crowed but the hostesses kept a check on yes.."}
{"text":"Went there with my daughter and her boyfriend. They go there often. Not my cup of tea. For starters we ordered an appetizer sampler but they didn't have the cheese bites and didn't want to substitute something for us. Hey, I didn't run out...you did. Accommodate me. At least try.
My meal, steak and ribs combo. Loaded potato? A liitle sour cream and cheese isn't what I'd call loaded. The ribs I think we're cooked earlier in the week and just warmed up. Steak was very chewy ant the cole slaw had zero flavor. Sorry I call it as I see it. A really bad experience. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Not bad food or portions for the price service at this location is hit or miss the chili chicken and shrimp is pretty good."}
{"text":"There on a Tuesday night, ate at the high top bar area.  Waiter was prompt and friendly.  I give the waiter five stars, assuming he was not supposed to bus the tables ... when i left I noticed all the tables covered in dirty dishes, no customers.  Weird.

I ordered blackened salmon with broccoli and southern green beans.  The veggies were great, but the fish had a not so fish flavor ... i should have sent it back.  It is like they meant to coat it with something, but messed up.  Oh well, i just wont go back."}
{"text":"Always a good choice. Balance between cost and taste and is always consistant. Come for the chicken tenders and leave with a couple margharitas. This cheddar s has great service and a nice atmosphere for whatever occasion."}
{"text":"The Monte Cristo was pretty good, next time I'll order it extra crispy. Disneyland's is still the best.

Macaroni and cheese side was delish.

Service was great.

Great price as well, tons of food.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say. Stopped in for a light lunch, food was delicious and atmosphere was pleasant. Saw the manager walking around, though I never saw him check and make sure anyone was doing alright, which might be a good idea for being a new place."}
{"text":"I had the ribs with Mac and cheese my wife had the cheese steak. Kids had the chicken tenders. 

It was all so good the ribs were perfect the Mac and cheese is the best ever. Very pleased thanks whiskey there was one on the west side"}
{"text":"Well we visited again & as in the past there were some issues with our meals. However, I'm giving another 4 stars because our server Christopher was awesome and our food was good as well. C ordered the fried shrimp dinner $10.79. According to him the shrimp was very tasty. Since he ate everything on the plate, I'll take his word for it. The rest of us ordered the full racks of ribs $15.49 ea. This is the rib bargain of the century. I have it almost every time we're here & they are very good ribs. I would add however, that if you like your ribs wet, ask for extra bbq sauce either on the ribs or on the side as they do skimp a bit on the sauce. I got my ribs with the Steamed Fresh Broccoli and Southern Green Beans. They were both just fine.
Again I ordered the Sangria Swirl & yet again it was not swirled. This time it was all just mixed in. For $3.99 it still is a BARGAIN! And that is the regular price, not a happy hour price. K & I just paid $9 ea for a frozen Margarita at Tia Rosa and although it was a fine Marg, seriously!
This is a 3 star place, but the prices and servers like Christopher bump it up a notch. Four Stars."}
{"text":"Cheddar a is refreshing. The baked potato soup is good. The red beans and rice should be a main dish! Add a little andouille sausage and some red onion and POW home freaking run!  Wait staff very pleasant. The ambience is good as is the decor but it was crazy noisy in the place for lunch. Check for four came to $48 so it was good value."}
{"text":"We were their at 05:24 pm on 12/29/16 and our Server was Cheryl.  My wife had the 1/2 soup and sandwich with a plate of Nachos.  First I would like to say that Cheryl had to be about the best outstanding server one could ask for.  A great smile, service was spot on.  She never let our drinks go dry.  And as for the food, both meals were outstanding.  When we come to the valley Cheddars is one of our first choices to have lunch at.  The bathrooms were well maintained and the eating area was very very clean. 

We live in Casa Grande and wish very much if Cheddars would build down here.  We are lacking a good restaurant such as Cheddars. 

Thank you and have a happy New Year."}
{"text":"the worst service I have ever gotten at Cheddar's and I have been to many other Cheddar's with much better service. I either had some rather inattentive waitress, but she wasn't inattentive with her other customers. A beer on tap should not take 24 minutes to be brought to our table. The manager there is not helpful either. I would never go to this particular restaurant at this location again. Other than that, Cheddar's food is always a pleaser."}
{"text":"We thought we'd try this place out and have dinner with the family. We got there around 5:30 and the parking lot was packed! Always a good sign when there's nowhere to park. Surprisingly, even though there were a handful of people waiting in the doorway, we were sat right away.

We ordered our drinks, then a couple of appetizers. The spinach dip was very good! I highly recommend the cheese bites too!

My mother never got her salad prior to her meal, so that was a negative. I also noticed that the table next to us didn't get their appetizer until after their meal showed up...not directly affecting us, but because of my mom's salad thing, it threw up a red flag for me. 

Our waitress was very friendly and decently attentive. Had to ask for refills once but she did very well. The food came out fast and the service was on par! 

Our entrees were delicious! The chicken tenders were gigantic and delicious! They have a really good crunch with the breading they use! Definitely get the chicken tenders if you're hungry! My husband had the fried shrimp, which he thought was very good. And the Cajun pasta was good, but there was no sausage in it like the menu said. 

Overall the visit was great! The food was very good and service was just right!"}
{"text":"First time I tried this place I hated it (the Tucson location) years later I thought I'd give it another try and went to this location and I really enjoyed it. Only one problem with the visit. 

Cheese curds: sadly, over cooked, when fried cheese is over cooked the cheese will come out of the breading leaving them hallow, busy night though so it's ok, it happens. 

Grilled tilapia with shrimp and mango salsa: very, very good! I'm on a mango kick lately so it was very delicious. Fish was cooked just right, even the rice was good, a lot of places have gross rice that clumps up, this wasn't.  

Fried chicken strips: I liked them, really crunchy

Sides:
Mac and cheese: soooooo good, and I'm super picky about mac and cheese, I loved it! Highly recommend!

Broccoli: good, not too soft and not hard

Mash potatoes and gravy: really good, love their gravy

The dessert cookie: I got one to-go, haven't had it yet but looks amazing. I asked them to put the ice cream in a separate container so that the warm cookie wouldn't melt the ice cream on the drive home, they were actually nice enough to put each ingredient in a separate closed container. =)

The service: awesome service!! Didn't wait long for anything, didn't go without a refill, and the waitress was a sweetheart! The receipt says her name was Susannah.

Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday night around 7:30 & was seated immediately. We were a bit surprised since we've had to wait in the past and the restaurant was full. The menu has a variety of made-from-scratch dishes. The service was good. Hubby's sangria was the best I've tasted in a long time, as was the queso dip my daughter ordered. If you're looking for dessert, try the apple crisp... however. You'll need to share it. It's large!"}
{"text":"For the price, this is one of the best restaurants you can find. Good selection of tasty, affordable entrees and a healthy selection is side vegetables. The desserts looked really good too, but I was too full to eat any. Great price performer."}
{"text":"I've only been once and went for happy hour I was told to try the tea that it was highly suggested it was very good but I had 4 and didn't get a taste of liquor I'm very specific about my drink me personally if I do go back it won't be for the tea I did try  the crossoints with honey butter if I'm not mistaken and was delicious"}
{"text":"Good service. Good portions. Liked the Wisconsin cheese curds. Beer was cold. Ribs were tender and the shrimp was good."}
{"text":"Great food and drinks! Surprisingly nice decor for such an inexpensive place. The food is pretty calorie intense but for a once in a while treat they make the unhealthy worth it! I will be working out for a couple weeks just so I can visit here again! The montecristo sando is the best I have tasted!"}
{"text":"I went to Cheddar's for the first time and loved it. People have been telling about it for a while now and I finally got there. The service was excellent, the waitress was very nice and she knew what she was doing and what was needed and when. The food portions were huge, we all took to go boxes home and left a very nice tip. Oh and you know how some restaurants give you free biscuits or rolls while you wait, well Cheddar's gives you crossaints!!! VERY IMPRESSED!!"}
{"text":"As a chain establishment, this place is surprisingly good. I have been here multiple times and never had a bad experience. Cheddar's is one of only two eateries I will go to in Arizona because of the cleanliness and fresh food. The pot pie is really good and a huge fan of the sweet heat chicken and shrimp."}
{"text":"Awesome place to come especially if your looking for some interesting drinks.  They have a pain killer and a maui Margarita which are our favorite.  The price in everything is perfect nothing out of budget.  The food had been tasteful and presentable.  Will be coming back and trying new food"}
{"text":"There are gazillion dining options in the University area, but Cheddar's is my old stand-by.  But before you hold me accountable, please read on.  My 2 thumb-up reasons for coming here: selections and price.  I didn't say service, because I have had bad service here before.  Sometimes the wait is CRAZY!  But the waiter we had the most recent visit was great and we managed to beat that lunch crowd.  And I didn't say taste/quality, because after all this is a chain restaurant, you get what you can expect to get from any chain places.  

I would say food is average.  I love the shrimp & chicken asian salad.  I also love the country fried steak (ohhhh I LOVE country fried anything...).  This past visit I got the fried shrimps and it was crispy and decent. And their honey croissant!  

But seriously, where else you can go out and eat and be able to get an entree with 2 sides for under $10?!  And they are great portions.  So yes, for a quick causal bite, Cheddar's is a solid choice."}
{"text":"I previously gave five stars, but... well...

My Monte Cristo had plastic wrap on it. I bit into it. I showed them. They explained that the Monte Cristos are wrapped in plastic until they are fried. They apologized and didn't charge me, and gave me one to-go. That was cool, they tried to make it right...

Except, there was plastic on the other sandwich too!

The whole ordeal has freaked out my work team. We won't be headed back. I get the first mistake, and will give them stars for Service and deliciousness. But they lose two stars, one for each piece of plastic in my Monte Cristo."}
{"text":"I enjoyed myself! My fiancé works in the same plaza and I mentioned to her that I wanted to try this place so a few nights ago she suggested we meet up there after she got off. On the outside and on the inside, it looks like a really nice restaurant like I'm new to the foodie game but I thought this place was pretty swanky. So imagine my surprise when I saw the menu and the prices - extremely, extremely reasonable. Like how TGIFriday's used to be before it got all snobby and overpriced on us. Maybe I'm just used to NY prices but nothing on the menu was over $14 if I recall correctly. The menu was typical American fare: burgers, sandwiches, salads, steak, seafood, and some pastas. We skipped the appetizer and my fiancé ordered the bacon cheeseburger. It was cooked well, tasted good, I really enjoyed her fries. They weren't too crunchy and they were seasoned well, not overly salty. I ordered the New Orleans pasta. The bread it came with was delicious (of course) and it wasn't too spicy to where my mouth was on fire. It was just enough. It had sausage, chicken, and shrimp. The chicken looked weird, like, I made my fiancé try it to make sure it was chicken and before she tasted it she assured me it was sausage and it wasn't. So chicken that looks like sausage was a little weird for me for it tasted good. I took half of it home and ate it for dinner the next day and it tastes even better. We ordered the monster cookie for dessert and we weren't really feeling it. It was like a chocolate chip butter cookie, it was brittle on the sides and didn't have a cookie taste or feel to it. They're made to order which was fine for us but we're BIG fans of the pizookie from BJ's and that was no pizookie. Overall, I would definitely go back. Our waiter, Mike, was so nice and his demeanor was cool as a cucumber, I bet he never gets mad, lol. Next time, however, I'll ride with my fiancé so that I can drink because that Painkiller drink looked delicious and the 2 per customer limit really has me intrigued."}
{"text":"SKIP IT. It was nothing to rave about. Everything is fried and gross. Service was terrible. I will not go back. I will say, the inside décor is nicely done. I just expected more. I would rather spend my money at Texas Roadhouse. 

I ordered the chicken ceasar pasta salad - it was terrible. Friends ordered burger - It was ok. Just blah. Not for me."}
{"text":"This was a very nice time.
I enjoyed the service and the staff 
Was amazing.
I went late afternoon which was nice, cause it was quite and a quit warm environment. I'd recommend this place to all my friends. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"If I could rate it lower I would. We've been to cheddars in other areas and had great experiences, this was terrible. My husbands salad was gross, the offered to replace it with a different one and he said no he had lost his appetite for one and they still charged him full price for his lunch combo. His sandwich bread was stuck to the plate. My chicken was dry. No one ever offered refills. And the bathroom was gross, the floor was slippery and slimy, the doors to the stalls looked like they had never been cleaned and the soap in the soap dispenser was so watered down it barely lathered up at all. We will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"I really like Cheddar's.  I know that I can go in and get a hot meal that tastes good.  I was hoping they had the fried chicken patty special that I hear is fabulous but that was not the case on this visit.  I typically go for the grilled tilapia served over rice, with two sides wihch is what I enjoyed on this visit.  The waiter was super nice and others assisted him with the large party as needed (great teamwork).  The restaurant also has an okay wine selection to complement your meal.  The dessert menu is limited, but the Hot Fudge Cake Sundae (see photo - no one should eat this alone) and the Cheddar's Legendary Monster Cookie are quite fabulous!"}
{"text":"Wow is this place poppin! We arrived and the place was packed. There was a 5 to 10 minute wait, and we were super hungry. We sat down in 5 minutes! I didn't want to come here when the place opened and thought I'd give them some time to work out the new business kinks. I'm glad I did, cause looking at all the bad reviews and good ones had me very curious about this place. But anyway the service was really awesome, the girl asked all the right questions and took down our whole order... The only thing was she sold herself short a little bit by not following through with all the awesome questions she had... For instance my wife ordered the chicken Alfredo, she said it came with veggies and my wife said she would like them on the side. well, we never got them at all. The other thing is she asked if we wanted our salads before our food, and said yes! Definitely.... And of course our food came out with our salad, equaling our food to be cold after we ate our salad. Food was not hot! Probably the biggest complaint. It was slightly warm though, and atleast it was good... I warned the staff but I didn't want them to take my food. Was only trying to inform them. The garlic bread served with our food was only 1 little piece, and really soggy with butter, barely toasted, no crunch to it at all! I asked for more bread, and she brought me 1 more slice of sogginess.....oh well, me and my wife are extremely picky, and like lots of bread to go with our New Orleans pasta and chicken Alfredo. Honestly we really liked the food even though the little things didn't add up very nicely. We will come back! They are always super slammed so I could tell the waitress was overwhelmed and the kitchen staff wasn't working with her to really make the customers extremely happy. You can tell this place is going to have a lot of criticism, but I recommend trying it out and see if it's for you, maybe give it another month for things to slow down a little bit, but ultimately the food is good, service is good, decor is nice.... Place is loud, but what do you expect from a new business thats just jam packed with curious Arizonans."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. Food took over an hour, service not that great. Another customer threw up around my party and other guests and the staff didn't even offer to move us and I had to walk away from the smell. 

Staff did not offer any discounts or anything. 

Because of this experience, I'll never eat at another Cheddar's again. And the sanitary rating needs to be lowered!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I usually love Cheddars but this location was real bad !!!! First the drinks came out and she forgot which was Coke zero and Diet Coke! Then we ordered Chips and salsa and our main dishes came first! We were done with our main dishes so I said just forget the chips!! My son wanted ketchup and the first bottle was empty, then they gave us another bottle and that was empty too really! When the refills came for drinks she mixed up the Diet and Coke Zero again, and she had only 2 drinks! They have changed the chicken breading and I like the old receipt better! Pretty disappointing Cheddars I hope someone in corporate straightens this place out!! 

But I did speak to Mike about my experience and he was very nice and I will them another shot!!!"}
{"text":"Not really impressed. Scratch made doesn't necessarily mean high quality food or good taste. We ordered the spinach dip which tasted frozen and then microwaved. For our entree we had the pecan chicken salad and tortilla soup. The soup tasted like salt water with crunchy tortilla strips on top. The salad was iceberg lettuce with shredded cheddar cheese on top. Service admitted it was her first day. The service could have been great and the food would still have made this place not somewhere we will return. Prices weren't bad, but food quality w"}
{"text":"So I finally got the opportunity to get over to this place last night.  I've been dying to experience the hype and I was quickly disappointed.  

When my daughter and I got there it was perfect timing. We were greeted and seated right away. But when we were leaving people were waiting for tables.  

Our meal consisted of an appetizer and two entrees.  So let's start with the appetizer.  We started off with a small portion of the Texas cheese fries.  It was perfect for two.  It was more than enough actually.  You could do this for three and stretching it maybe for four.  Overall the flavor was good but it was very salty.  I could feel my hands swelling as we were still there.  

Our dinner entrees.  My daughter ordered the bacon burger.  Fries are extra with the burger.  My daughter asked about the cost of the salad and our server told her she's give it to her complimentary.  I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and you get a side with that so I ordered the Mac and cheese.  Which I was told \" good choice\" at time of ordering.  So this made me very excited about my choice.   

Let's start with the bacon burger.  Appearances are very deceiving and plating is a big miss.  It was a half pound burger on a plate.  All by its lonesome.  So that just looked odd.  My daughter picks up her burger and takes her first bite and quickly spits out what she just bit off.  I asked what was wrong and she takes the top of the bun off and in the finely shredded lettuce she had to hunt for the pickles.  When she found them, and if she liked pickles, she would have pickle with every bite and the bacon.  She loves her bacon and had to take it out because it wasn't quit cooked all the way.  Needless to say she could only eat half of it and left the rest behind.  

Now for my buffalo chicken wrap and Mac and cheese.  It was two tortillas cut in half with a side of ranch dressing for dipping.  Here appearances were not deceiving.  I could tell by the tortilla that I would not be happy and again plating is a miss.  I took my first bite and wondered where the buffalo sauce was.  It was very bland from that standpoint.  I couldn't taste buffalo sauce at all.  Disappointing.  Then just like my daughter I begin to taste pickle.  I unroll the wrap and I too would have had pickle with every bite.  I didn't even eat half of my meal.  Then I decided to move on to my side.  Another disappointment.  The cheese was very bland and watered down.  

Service.  Our waitress was very nice but we didn't have a check in or asked at all how our meal was.  I finally got a refill on my tea after the bill came.  Our total bill came to $28.00 and it probably would have been better off going to a drive through and saved half and gotten a better meal.  

This restaurant falls into the category of new American and gastropub.  New American yes, I could see that.  Gastropub I'm still questioning.  I've been to a great, high end gastropub in Los Angeles and I can't even compare the two.  I think they missed that mark.  I think you can tell by my one star rating that I won't be going back again."}
{"text":"Most Bang for your Buck?  Absolutely.  
Choices on top of Choices? You Bet.
Nice Atmosphere and a good staff? Yes and Yes.
Busy enough to show that is better than your average chain restaurant?  Mmhmm.

This place has many different selections and is the perfect place for lunch and dinner.  I ordered the club sandwich.  \"It is important, when you eat at my restaurant, you never order BLT.\" - Big Daddy...Order the club for lunch, it tastes great ."}
{"text":"Food was okay. We got salads. Had to wait 10 minutes for a fork.  Don't sit me next to the kitchen if its dirty. Trash all over the kitchen floor and no one, even the manager even gave it a second thought.  Went to the restroom,  trash all over the floor but the whole restaurant had trash everywhere. Not very appetizing.  Big disappointment for my first meal after landing in NC."}
{"text":"Went for lunch had bacon cheeseburger with fries which were extra..sweetest. average at best. Dinner menu looked interesting.will go back for dinner.."}
{"text":"I really like the ambiance here, but that's about as much praise as I can give Cheddar's. Whoever cooked our meal here was really heavy-handed with that salt shaker. Everything from the appetizer to the entree was really salty for me. I ordered the chicken fried steak. The steak was tough. Is it supposed to be that hard to eat? I'm not sure if my expectations were wrong. There was also way too much batter on the steak. Sauce was salty, our onion rings appetizer was salty, and my chicken tortilla soup was salty as well. Three strikes, you're out, Cheddar's.

I never expect much out of a chain restaurant, but Cheddar's was just really disappointing on this particular visit."}
{"text":"Pass by this restaurant daily, and always wanted to try it. From the outside, this place looks fancy but casual attire is welcomed. 

The food looks reasonably priced. I chose the barbecue chicken and half rack of ribs with broccoli. The broccoli was great. The ribs were dry but told the waitress and the manager brought me a fresh slab. This was a lot better. The chicken was also decent. I would recommend you try it and give your own opinion. Flavor didn't knock the ball out of the park for me!"}
{"text":"Casual food and drink for good prices. The best item in the menu is the honey croissants. I could come here and order drinks, while only eating the croissants. The rest of the food is similar to an Applebee's. 

The interior is not very appealing, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"After many wistful nights staring longingly at their online menu and many canceled plans to pop into the restaurant, we finally got to dine at Cheddar's.

Cheddar's serves up some great American comfort food at a decent price.  The place was buzzing with activity but there were still lots of empty tables available at 6pm on a Friday night.  The three of us shared the Wisconsin Cheese Bites as an appetizer.  These were super delicious when they were hot out the fryer.  \"Melty, oozing, little clouds of cheese that's lightly battered\" would be how I describe them.  Even after they cooled down significantly, they were still a nice little treat.  Although a bit salty, I liked them.  I love cheese!

My dinner companions had ribs, chicken tenders, and some sides.  I tried a little bite of the ribs and they were right --- they were a little dry despite the nice glaze!  I was fooled.  The mac and cheese also had a weird texture.  It felt a little gritty.  Is it just me?  Anyways, I ordered the chicken pot pie for myself and it was amazing!  Crusty flaky top with big chunks of chicken with some peas, carrots, and potatoes all swimming in a creamy sauce... Oh man!  It made the Painkiller cocktail go down smoothly.  I also got a house salad with blue cheese dressing on the side with my pot pie and it was refreshing and delicious.  I only wish there were more giant chunks of blue cheese.  

While I'm not entirely sold on Cheddar's and I can't say it was everything I hoped for and more, I had a lovely dinner with two of best guys in town!  Would I come back?  Probably.  I think I want to try the chicken tenders!"}
{"text":"Great bartenders and service here. Love the Hawaiian Chicken sandwich! Wish they had more draft beers to choose from though!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients, REASONABLE prices, and killer drinks(try their long island iced tea!) A solid 4.5. Might not be the perfect place to take someone on a date because it's very busy inside but that's only because there's an understandable demand to eat at this restaurant. The cooks make everything from scratch, and this was definitely evident in our meals. Friendly customer service as well."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. Only reason it doesn't get five stars is the draft beer selection is pretty bad. Bud light being your only light beer choice is not a good start to your meal. No ipas to choose from at all either. As you beer rep to increase you portfolio it will help"}
{"text":"Typical American Fare but very reasonably priced, and $4.49 margaritas.  Enough said!  The Monte Cristo is amazing and the meals are big enough to share."}
{"text":"This is my first time to the Cheddars here in Arizona and from beginning to end, it screamed mediocrity. We went during a slow weekend lunch time, so there was no wait. The menu has a ton of options, so it should have something for just about anyone. Also the prices are very good for the amount of food they give, the portions are quite big. That was the good. The server was there and made sure my water cup stayed full, but seemed a bit disengaged and brought us our check with our food, which I found kind of odd. As for the food.. two of my kids got chicken tenders but none of them ate them saying they didn't like them. My other kid got the Mac and Cheese and enjoyed it. My wife got the buffalo chicken wrap and ate most of it. I ordered the ribs and chicken tenders with a \"loaded\" potato and Mac and cheese. I took one bite of the Mac and cheese and the loaded baked potato was plain and just sour cream and cheese. The ribs seemed over cooked and were ok and the chicken tenders were plain. Overall, there are a lot worse options out there but we probably will chose elsewhere in the future."}
{"text":"Cheddar's is good, but nothing special in my opinion. The food is decent, but the cheap prices are what really stick out to me. The service is hit or miss, sometimes great and sometimes not so much. This place is extremely busy on weekends, but not really worth waiting for in my opinion. My favorite thing about this restaurant are their honey butter croissants, they're SO good. Cheddar's is pretty average otherwise."}
{"text":"This place was ok.  We ate there on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch.  The place was busy.  We were seated quickly.  There seemed to be something on the menu to please everyone and the prices were reasonable.  I like that they serve different flavored lemonades.  I had the 6oz steak - with choice of 2 sided.  The portions were skimpy but the food was decent."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness this place was amazing! The food is delicious, their Island Tiki drink and all of their drinks was amazing, and our waitress, when she brought a box for our salad she also put extra ranch in it for at home. The price is great for what you get. Our waitress Leah had good timing for asking questions, helping us pick what we wanted, and again the extra ranch was a cherry on top! And she just stopped by and gave us dessert for being first time guests. 10/10 you should go. Thanks Leah!"}
{"text":"So I've been here a couple times and always enjoy the food. I usually get a Caesar salad to start with and it comes with these like honey butter croissants that are amazing. I usually ask for two of them because they are just that good. My normal entree is a small sirloin and chicken fingers plate with two sides. The Mac and cheese is really really good as a side and I usually pair it with fries. My sirloin a has been cooked a perfect medium rare each time I've gotten it.

On to the negative:
Out of the times I've been here, twice I've been skipped by servers. Tons of servers walk passed us and didn't stop by at all. Two times I've sat in the booth with no one coming to greet us for 10~ minutes so we've gotten up and left and gone somewhere else. Tonight we are going to outback next door.

Even getting bad food at a restaurant, service can always make up for it but when there is no service and the food is good, you lose any of my business. It's a bummer because we enjoy cheddars. Hopefully they pull it together."}
{"text":"The ribs are excellent, fall off the bone mouth watering deliciousness.  Drinks are great too. I had the passion punch and it was very refreshing and fun.  The prices were more than reasonable and the drinks felt like happy hour prices. I will definitely go here again."}
{"text":"I wish I would have referred to Yelp first - what's wrong with me?  My only excuse is it was someone else's suggestion/desire to come here.  Does that help redeem me at all?!  :)

I went here to meet former coworkers for lunch about a week ago and was quite impressed...at the MENU.  I'd heard mixed reviews about Cheddar's for quite some time, mainly concerning their slow service, so I was a bit skeptical.  But their surprisingly tasteful interior and impressive menu brought about hope.  I have to say, the impressiveness ends at the décor and the menu selections.  I said SELECTIONS.

I had trouble making up my mind, so many things looked/sounded so tasty.  I settled on the chicken tenders & shrimp combo and a Caesar side salad.  I was impressed that my entrée came with two sides - wasn't expecting that, especially not for $9.99.  I selected the \"southern style\" green beans and baby carrots.   I must give credit where credit is due; the SIDE ITEMS were great.  But it ended there.  Neither the chicken nor the shrimp had any flavor to them whatsoever.  I was shocked.  I didn't even finish my chicken tenders because they didn't seem fully cooked to me.  The breading on them was very light in color, very flaky, and TASTELESS, as though it was nothing more than mere flour and maybe egg whites or buttermilk?  No seasoning at all.  Same with the shrimp.  Very blah to say the least.  And very disappointing.  

Service I must admit was much better than expected, although bordering on smothering.  Had a very young waiter that seemed to try way too hard to \"be there\" for us and to try to be pleasant & friendly (was somewhat forced rather than genuine).  Started to get on my nerves (then again if you knew me, you'd know that when you begin getting smothery you're pushing my buttons big-time!).  However given the negative reviews I'd heard in the past regarding service, I'd rather have this than a non-existent server, so I quickly got over that.  He also didn't seem to be that familiar with the menu & its flexibility (ie: this can be subbed for that, etc), so that was a little bit of a turnoff to my dining companion.

In a nutshell University City has far too many dining options, so I wouldn't select Cheddar's again.  Even with commendable service, the food has to match, and this place just didn't work for me, not even a little.  I'd rather eat at Chick-Fil-A across the street!"}
{"text":"I grew up eating Cheddar's. It's a smaller chain that doesn't advertise and how consistent, cheap food that's actually pretty good. My husband and I were excited one finally opened up in Arizona, specifically the Phoenix area, even if that location is way out in Chandler.

It's a big restaurant, so a wait usually isn't too bad. The food ranges from eh to pretty good to hey this isn't too bad. For appetizers, the onions rings aren't bad, and neither is the queso.

For entrees, you can get some healthier options. I usually like the veggie plate with a salad. Chicken fried steak is a good staple, and the burger isn't bad (although you have to order fries separately). The Caesar salad pasta is an interesting take on two dishes - basically a big Caesar salad on top of a bed of pasta.

Desserts are all pretty good too. Mixed cocktails are fun and the painkiller is actually strong.

If you're on a budget and in the Chandler area, especially if you have kids, Cheddar's is a good way to go. I like to eat here when I'm homesick and trying to save some money."}
{"text":"I visit this all the time when I'm in town.. The food is great and customers service (bartenders) is always on point. However today's bartenders customer service was soooooooo dry and dead . I don't care how good the food is, if the customer service is poor I will never come back."}
{"text":"This was our first visit after seeing a feed on my FB page.  The facilities were really nice, modern and trendy. Our server Robert was really nice and explained their philosophy of everything being made fresh and from scratch.  He was very knowledgeable and polite.  The wait time between ordering and receiving our food was as bit excessive and I could tell that Robert was concerned.  Our food was absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and interior. Higher class looking place for affordable prices. Came here for dinner on a Friday but the wait line was out the door so we decided to come back another time (make reservations for dinner) came back for lunch on a Sunday and it was moderately busy, there was a wait line out the door as we left around 12:30pm so this place is popular. 

The floor was a buzz with servers all over the place, looked very well staffed and all tables were tended to from what I could see. Our server Amy was a delight and kept our drinks topped off without being intrusive or upsetting the dining experience. Thumbs up to her! 

Menu is large with a decent selection of just about every type of 'American' foods. Steaks, pastas, chicken, wraps, sandwiches, burgers, appetizers. Large non alcoholic and alcoholic drink menu. 

Check this place out, I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"My food came out fast and great taste. The waiter was very nice but seemed to have an attitude but it was do-able. I definitely will go back. I had the Dijon Chicken. I was satisfied."}
{"text":"i wasn't very impressed with the menu for lunch.  everything seemed really heavy.  They did have a small menu of under 650/700 cal items but none sounded very good.  I asked about their \"vegetable plate\" which is actually just 4 of their side dishes...which is funny because the only vegetable on their side dish menu is corn or potatoes.  so I ended up getting their chicken salad which came with their signature croissant that was generously buttered and glistening.

The service was good and we were sat quickly."}
{"text":"Wow... must have missed all the Yelp drama... but I had lunch here today.  The portions are GINORMOUS!  Food was good and the wait staff was friendly.

The butter croissant that comes with the salads are really addicting... that could have been my lunch right there.  I ordered the \"new\" Sheppard's Pie which was pretty good.  Way too big for me to finish it.  At least I know what I\"m having for dinner tonight! 

Can easily see this place from WT Harris, but hard to get back into the parking lot... not unusually bad, but cuts into the driving time if you are concerned about getting in and out - back to the office at a reasonable hour."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I drove past Cheddars a few months back, and decided we wanted to try it out. Today was the day that finally happened!

As soon as we walked in, we were impressed by the decor and cleanliness. We got seated right away at a cozy booth. Our server Matthew was quick to greet us and suggest appetizers and drinks. Our onion rings were amazing, and for only $5 we got a huge stack. 

Both of our meals were served promptly and were very tasty. Matthew was quick on refills and checked back on us frequently, always with a smile. It's safe to say we will be back!"}
{"text":"Cheddar's is a much better alternative than many other chain restaurants in the area (applebee's, chili's, TGI Friday's, etc.) It has all of your staples like burgers, chicken, seafood, sandwiches, pastas, etc. Cheddar's has a little bit more of a southern flair than other chain restaurants. Not soul food by any means, but just more a more \"homey\"/comfort food feel. I have had an entree from almost every \"section\" of the menu at this point. The portions are always HUGE and the food always tastes good. Also, I think the prices are CHEAP! I am always surprised when the check comes how much food we've ordered and how cheap it is. 

Salads come with a croissant that has a honey drizzle on them that is AMAZING. So delicious. You can also order 3 of them separately. I would highly recommend them. 

The service here is usually pretty hit or miss. I've gone and had great service, but other times I've gone and had TERRIBLE service."}
{"text":"Having been to Cheddars on several prior occasions - tonight was a total disaster! 
From the 59 minute wait for a table ( we were told it would be 30 minutes when we arrived) to the cold burgers we were served, it just kept getting worse.
I discovered the menu has recently changed and my favorite salad is no longer on the menu. I ordered a drink but was served the wrong drink - and informed the waiter of this error immediately, which he did correct .  
Our onion rings were cold and chewy, not crisp and the burgers dry and boring, in addition to being served cold. 
Overall - not the general standard I have come to expect from Cheddars. 
Hopefully - tonight was just a fluke as I usually eat here at lunch times."}
{"text":"Nothing special about the food here and the service definitely needs some work. This is one of those places that seems to be a novelty in the area with a great location. Lower your expectations and be prepared to wait far too long for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Food is great, servers where awesome. However when I looked up to see if I could reserve a table as a call ahead the website said I could, when I called this bitchy lady answered and she said \"excuse me we don't do that.\" One, no need to be rude about it and two, I did that two weeks ago.  I'm not sure what changed in two weeks but regardless you should update the website, and get less bitchy receptionist. I also over heard one of your servers say \"I'm over this place.\" Might wanna work on making your servers happy because they're the face of your restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Cheddars for quite some time now and finally had the chance last weekend.  As noted in many of the reviews, the menu is stocked full of american comfort food and I certainly made sure I got my fill.  We ordered the two most popular appetizers on the menu.  The Wisconsin Cheese Bites and the Chips and Queso.  Both were delicious!!   

I love baked potato soup- so gave that a try to and it was also very good.  There was plenty of food so we all kind of picked at the main course dishes which consisted of the monte cristo sandwhich and the chicken tenders.  

Everything was really good, the restaurant was clean and the ambience comfortable.  The price was what you would expect around 9$ for the meals.  

Only reason I didn't give the full 5 stars here was for the service.  The waiter was nice but didn't check on us after taking our order.  We had to grab him to get refills after I food arrived.  If we order appetizers pre meal- we most likely will need those drinks refilled by the time the meal arrives.  We only saw him again when he was ready to give us our check.  Not a huge deal, but they werent very busy when we were there so it was a little disappointing.  

I will definitely go back- I would like to try the ribs and we had a good experience all in all."}
{"text":"First time I ate here it was wonderful couple months down the line I saw they were hiring online so I applied got a call back for a interview got the job on the spot  I was so excited to work here this was my first serving job and will be my last after my 1yr experience working here where do I begin first let me say the food the restaurant is fabulous but management is 100% horrible they treat their servers like crap they talk you like your dumb they have no respect for your time I'll go in the office whether it's for help or to cash out they will ignore you just to converse among each other the only good manager was Jason the others were useless and lazy all the do is sit the office and eat they aren't fit for this company at all I must say my experience working here really changed how feel about this place I haven't stepped foot in this place since I quit and it been a 1 yr foods great atmosphere great to work NO don't do it"}
{"text":"Pretty good food for super reasonable prices. The decor is also a lot nicer than one would expect for a restaurant with $10 entrees. The menu is very varied so there's something for everyone."}
{"text":"Looooooootttttttttt of food.  

We ordered the chicken fried chicken and chicken fried steak.  The chicken fried steak was enough for one...possibly two.  The chicken fried chicken was enough for 2 easily, probably 3.

We ordered onion rings also.  We ordered them late so they actually came out after the entrees.  They were good, but really an unnecessary add on since we already had more food than we could eat in a sitting (2 or 3 sittings sure...one...no way).

We got there about 5:20 or so and were seated immediately but the place was pretty much packed.  10 minutes later and then half of Chandler showed up.  Not sure what the wait times were but it looked to be at least a half an hour based on the number of people.

Service was ok.  They just opened in April so I expect they're still working out bugs but overall no complaints.

Based on the size of the portions, I'm not sure I'd order two meals again...especially if I order an appetizer."}
{"text":"I went to Cheddar's yesterday for lunch. Our server Annie was very friendly and attentive, the food was very tasty. I had the Monte Cristo and my wife had the fish and chips. Both were huge portions, you can definitely share a meal here. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Pretty nasty, the cheesesteak was so salty it was impossible to eat.  Chicken strips were still pink on the inside and I could have made a way better salad at home. Service was great. Wine and beer selection needs work too. Sad we went, should have gone to NYPD pizza."}
{"text":"I've been a couple of times, but I'm ok with not returning. Although, this location is in a \"university\" area does not give the staff an excuse to talk and Snapchat as opposed to serving guest. Not really much needs to be said here... but on the bright side it's a good price point ($10-$20pp) if you would like to try it for yourself."}
{"text":"So, today's is my daughter's 11th birthday. She's been here before with her mother and asked me to take her. I agreed because the menu looked pretty good and I was prepared to take wherever she wanted to go. It's in a building near Chandler Mall that I recall being several different restaurants over the years. The ambiance was pretty good when we arrived and it reminded me of a KEG Restaurant. We got seated pretty quickly and my kid excitedly told the waiter it was her birthday. He just kinda looked at her and then asked me if I wanted a drink. I was not excited about the lack of craft and local brews but he said they also had one SanTan brew. He also said they had other bottle types in the back. I asked if he had an IPA. He said he didn't think so & just stared at me for a good minute rather than suggesting he'd go check or anything. By now I was pretty uncomfortable and just ordered the SanTan. We got our order taken pretty quickly. She got the Salmon. I got the ribs & buffalo tenders w/ broccoli cheese casserole that I heard was good. 

Food came. The tenders were moist but buffalo sauce was sparse. I had to ask for more. Ribs were fine but not falling off the bone like the waiter suggested. The broccoli casserole came in the smallest bowl I've ever seen. It was half empty and crunchy on the top. I took one bite with the spoon & it was half gone. It was also warm at best. Ugh. There wasn't even enough to send back.

So we finished our food & I snuck away to ask the waiter if they had a birthday dessert. He said they didn't so I ordered the fudge cake. I asked if they have a candle. He said they don't. I asked if they sing or anything for a kid's birthday. He acted like I was crazy. I went back to my table shaking my head. He brought out the cake a little while later (it's huge and is clearly for 5 people!!). We ate what we could and then asked for a box and our check. 

I got the check and was really surprised that the dessert was charged on there. Seriously? I was disappointed, but we already ate part. Then I saw the bill, & they had suggested tips on it. 22% tip? WTF. There was no way. And then I noticed that was WITH tax. Since when does anyone tip on tax? Come on! I tipped 14% and promise to never go to this place again."}
{"text":"Oh my god! I cannot wait until I get home to write this review. Their food is so awful! My friend ordered a jalapeño burger and it was completely covered with grease. I ordered a Tilapia fish with mango salsa and my mouth is covered with salt and oil. Its so salty I cant even taste anything else. The only thing that tastes good is French fries. I cannot imagine any restaurant can possibly screw that up. 

The service is great and the hostesses are nice. If you like super fatty and oily food, this is a place for you. Otherwise, I will not recommend this place to anyone."}
