{"text":"Went here a few months ago and it wasn't too bad. Good enough to get me to go back again today. Wish it hadn't been though. Today I ordered the shrimp tacos and it was a 3 on a 10 scale. That was the good part. Everything else tasted BAD, EVERYTHING. My wife wasn't pleased with her Cheese enchilada either. The service was ok and the staff was pleasant but we definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"The food and service are great. Although the server has enough to do, he was quite forgetful of our chips that we requested. That is alright considering he suggested a good portioned size order of fajitas for two that worked out just fine and filled our bellies. 
We will certainly return."}
{"text":"The food was lovely and we had the sweetest little girl named Vanessa go over the menu with us, she was very helpful and adorable:)"}
{"text":"The food and service were perfectly fine, just nothing special."}
{"text":"The service was terrible-didn't get one drink refill, the steak was packaged-tasting, the cheese on my chicken burrito dish hardened because it wasn't even served hot...I just don't want to go on- it was that bad. We will never be back."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised at how good our meal here was!  Great Server, too...very attentive and even brought us a free dessert Fried Ice Cream because it was our first time there!  Now that's how you should treat customers!  We loved the chips and the bean dip.  Their kids menu is awesome and had something to please each of my 3 picky eaters.  I had the pollo fundido  which was delicious and my husband had the fajita style chicken chimichanga and he loved it!  We will definitely be back!  The only reason I didn't give them all 5 stars was due to our table being old looking and very unstable (wobbly).  This is really a minor thing, but nice furniture always adds to the ambience of a restaraunt.  The most important things, the food and service, get very high marks from me!"}
{"text":"Food was good, service good, other reviews are harsh, food nothing to write home about but it's an 'american' Mexican and it delivers what you'd expect"}
{"text":"I normally really enjoy this restaurant. We get takeout from there pretty regularly and everything is usually pretty good. However, the last time we got takeout the entire order was messed up. I didn't receive an extra side item I ordered, and the two combo meals we got (both with 3 item choices) didn't have one correct item in them. We called to inform the store. The manager was nice and offered to send us a $30 gift card in place of a refund. That was over a month ago and we still haven't received anything. Very disappointing. The meal was over $30 plus a tip I left. When you eat at a restaurant they fix things for you, but when you order takeout you're at their mercy. You have to trust they got it right, or after you take the drive home you just have to eat whatever they gave you or take more time to drive back and wait for them to hopefully get it right again. I work in a restaurant and know mistakes happen. Also I'm not big on freebies or comps. But I do expect a restaurant to follow through when they offer something. If they didn't want to send the gift card they shouldn't have offered, and I would have driven back for an actual refund or replacement order. Now I probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time on Friday. Our server was great and the food was good. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Terribly disappointed that the service has gotten so bad, we will no longer be making this our preferred family night out place. Took a friend here and the kids a few weeks ago to show this friend \"our place\" we love so much. Waiter was absolutely horrible. No drink refills, sat part of our fajitas in front us of for 15 minutes before he returned with our kids food! Then finally returned with one kids  plate. Had to go back for other. We were still missing toppings and tortillas for fajitas and had to sit there for another 25 minutes with no silverware no tortillas and no toppings just staring at sizzling plate of meat! When the waiter finally returned and I let him know how rude that was, he decided not to return to refill drinks and to let heaping piles of plates stack up and to not even return to give us the bill. So after waiting another 45 minutes we decide we are going to leave and tell the hostess that we will pay the manager. The manager implied that this happens all the time with this guy , gave us our meal for free. And let us know that this guy will be on corrective action, which by the way they're not supposed to tell customers but okay thanks. Fast forward to my husband and I actually taking the kids there again thinking that was just one bad experience, and they sat us in a section right by Mr. wonderful waiter. I made sure to let the hostess know we did not want him serving us again as he was horrible to us last time. So we get to wait for another waiter for about 15 minutes Who suffers from resting b face and acts like it's a task to wait on us. Meanwhile Mr. wonderful waiter And his bus boy friend are walking by and laughing and staring The entire duration of our meal. As were walking by the hostess counter on our way out, mr. wonderful is in a gossip corner with them and actually turns to me and says have a nice day and laughs. We will not be returning and apparently manager did nothing with this guy the first time."}
{"text":"Today we are trying Garcia's with the kids. Sign says they eat free. Got sat in a corner booth so we all could sit together. Chips were delivered quickly and drinks were Pepsi products. Chips and dips are tasty. Great bean dip. I had the pork fajitas and couldn't eat them all. Very tasty and lots of fixins. All 3 kids ate for free with only 2 adult meals.
Our experience was great and we will be back again son."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  The bean dip is the best.  I really appreciate that they always bring chips, salsa and bean dip every time.  My favorite is the Olivias Sampler.  It is a great mix of all the things I love."}
{"text":"WOW!!! Thanks Garcia's!!!  I hosted 42 people for a surprise party for my wife's 40th birthday and thanks to Garcia's excellent service and hospitality it was a total success.  Michelle, the Restaurant Manager couldn't have been more accommodating.  Having to deal with the stress of a surprise party was enough.  But when I showed up the day of the party I was given personal service by server Wendy who helped me blow up balloons, hang banners and was there dedicated to my party the whole night.  No one could quit talking about how good the service and food was.  I can't begin to give Garcia's the appropriate recognition for making one of my wife's most important days as memorable as possible.  AWWWEEESSSOOOMMEEE!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Alright, by looking at my rating of this place you may just write this place off.  But I have to explain.  I have been here twice and both times we had the same waiter, older gentleman with a southern accent.  He is one of the best servers ever, very prompt, polite and earns his tip.
Both times we noticed the place was curiously empty of patrons. The second time we went there was a banner out front that read \"New Management\", made me think it wasn't being ran well for awhile.
Now to explain the rating.  Both times we order their sampler plate, it comes with tacos, chimmichanga's, and something else. Anyways the first time after eating there I came home and puked at about 2 AM (we had dinner there).  The second time the same thing happened, so I thought too much of a coincidence.  Sorry Garcia's waiter, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Prompt and friendly service and great food. I especially liked the margarita magnifico."}
{"text":"I want to give them zero stars! When we first walk in there is already a family waiting and no host or hostess around to greet us. When the host walks by he tells us all we're gonna have to wait as he delivered food to someone outside. He comes back in and instantly walks to the back without a word. He comes out with a smug attitude, claps his hands and says \"alright, no ones getting sat for at least 20 minutes\" even though the restaurant is half empty!! When this is brought up he says that they are short on servers, which is understandable, however it was dinner time!! They should've been a little more prepared. Unfortunately this was my second time coming here, and although the food was good last time, I experienced the same terrible customer service the first time. It's too bad I will never ever go to this location again!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the portions are generous, but my wife and I are regulars because of the excellent service.  It doesn't matter if we order a full meal or just do happy hour, the Manager makes a point of stopping at our table to make sure everything is okay.  This Garcia's is one of the nicer restaurants in southern Tempe."}
{"text":"The food is good, portions are enough for an extra meal to take home   the chocolate mini chimis will delight any chocolate lover.  Waiter JUSTIN IS GREAT, get him if you can."}
{"text":"Good food, bad service. They took away our drinks (whole table) for a refills and it took 5+ minutes before they returned. I didn't even gave any water.  Had to walk to front to ask for our check too."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by my latest experience at this Garcia restaurant. I had purchased a local deal voucher for a $24 dinner for two. I was not aware that the voucher had an expiration date. When I printed the voucher I realized it had expired. We went to the restaurant anyway and talked to the front desk where we were told that the voucher would still be good. We were very surprised when our bill came to find out that we had to pay for the difference between what our voucher had cost and the very inflated promotional value of the meal. Thus we had to pay a second time.
So beware of Internet local deals: they do expire and the restaurants have no qualms making you pay twice! I used to go to Garcia relatively often. I guess I will part with them. The real beauty of this is that the manager tried to blame the local deal agency: they were the bad guys!!! In the end: Garcia profited from the deal more than anyone else. No one is dupe."}
{"text":"We used to go to Garcia's on Rural & 60 and really enjoyed their food. Last night we went to Garcia's on Warner and McClinktok (new location) after over 4 years and found that the food was very disappointing. I ordered Tilapia which was overcooked and chewy. My wife ordered veg Quesadilla which was greasy and the oil used for cooking had a strong smell. I don't think we'll be going there any more."}
{"text":"Service was very slow. Wait staff was not very well educated about the menu.  Beer was tepid. I had the tacos which were fine and the rice and beans were average. The wife had the Chille Verde and she said it was average as well. However the waiter forgot to bring the tortillas and we had to hunt him down to finally get them.  They had one bus boy trying to pass out chips and salsa and clean the tables, it was easy to see he was the hardest working person in the restaurant.  However, because he was the only person cleaning, while the hostesses sat around and gossiped and the manager was hiding someplace, the restaurant was full of empty tables with dirty dishes. 

The highlight of the evening came while watching the 2 hostesses continue to place patrons in a booth that had a broken light fixture. After being seated each group of guests would ask for the light to be fixed.  The first time the manager came over and tried a light bulb which she had swiped from another location in the restaurant only to find that it wouldn't fit. She was nice enough to move the guests to another location, but within just a couple of minutes the two hostesses had found a new victim to sit in the booth. It was comical to watch the show play itself out again and again. 

The bottom line is that the restaurant business is tough  and competition in the Mexican food arena is very strong so  I don't expect this Garcia's location to be around very long."}
{"text":"I'm a little biased with my review. Being a lifelong Phoenician we grew up going to a Garcia's in central phoenix that has long since closed. My partner and I had been frequenting the location on Rural until the hotel bought it.  We have gone to the new location on Warner many times. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, the staff is great and attentive!  I have my favorite items on the menu usually Pollo Fundido or Pork Tacos, no matter what is ordered I am never disappointed. I love the new location's space, very cozy and feels like an actual restaurant.  The patio is a great touch."}
{"text":"NEVER GOING BACK!
We went in later in the evening so I can kind of understand why our bean dip had a skin over it and the rice was old and crunchy! BUT if you can't keep your food fresh until close then close earlier. The person that brought our chips and salsa/dip was really rude (she?) was not helpful and clearly does not need to work in the service industry. Our waitress kept calling me sweetie and hun I hate that! Taco meat was dripping with grease yuck! My whole family got really sick after we ate there too. :( Good Mexican is getting hard to find!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is nice with half price apps and have price drafts, among other things. This is what the rating is based on.  Without happy hour, drinks are too expensive. The fajitas are usually great but need more meat, less onions and peppers."}
{"text":"The first and last time we went there was a spider in my moms rice. Could barely eat the rest of the night and the staff tried to act like they couldn't believe there was really a spider in the food."}
{"text":"My server Adriana was delightful! Attentive but didn't hover or rush me through my meal. I splurged and got a frozen Margarita and there was actually a good amount of tequila in it, which is rare with frozen Margarita! Add a bonus while I was eating Kyla the manager on duty brought me there lunch punch card pre-punched for my meal (buy 6 get one free). I had their two item lunch combo with a green corn tamale and a sour cream chicken and cheese enchilada. Both were fantastic and the combo is 8.99! I love the atmosphere, nice music at a decent volume and great seating for relaxing meals. I will be back regularly!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Good food, great service! Love the green salsa and the jalapeño cream cheese. The servers are very attentive and it's always clean! Really good margaritas."}
{"text":"First visit. Above average service. Great food. The fajita beef was exceptional. The chicken enchiladas were very good. Really loved the bean dip that was served with the chips and salsa. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood restaurant. Love the patio! Great margaritas, fresh chips and salsa plus delicious bean dip. Good food and service!"}
{"text":"The food portions were great with good prices! The food itself was just okay. The service was TERRIBLE!! The night we went, the restaurant was not too busy and the service was slow. The thing that really turned us off from ever going there again was the lack of knowledge of the staff. One of the people who waited on us appeared to be about 15 years old and did not know anything. When we asked if they had sopapillas, the person asked us what that was... It's a Mexican restaurant and you have never heard of s sopapilla?? Come on people!!"}
{"text":"i used to frequent this location often and always had zach as a server by request.  my order was always correct and we even let him order for us a couple times and were not dissappointed.  also let him persuade us to try new shots and drinks occasionally. the food and drinks were always good and if anything was wrong it was quickly rectified.  our waiter has since moved on so we no longer go here as often but if you read  this zach let me know where you are now we would like to come support you wherever you are."}
{"text":"We had a terrible Wed. evening.. at this restaurant.  We were here twice last year and enjoyed ourselves AND the food, enough to want to return.  We are snowbirds here for a month, and wanted to take a friend out for dinner.  First off... service was terrible, we sat out in the patio.  She took our order for drinks first.... never came back for a long time... drinks came.  Then waited FOR-EVER for her to come to our table to take our meal order.....  had to catch her eye... she arrives to take our order for the food.  It was cold outside, so we asked for the heater to be turned on... wasnt working... Meal came, sizzling fajita was not sizzling, all of us thought the meals were bland....  then comes in a miniature horse sized dog.... stretching out on the floor.  Is this possible???  Hygiene people.... think. 

And the fork I had was tin and almost bent when I cut into my enchilada.  I think it was from the gold rush days haha"}
{"text":"Slow service, they refused to give happy hour 1/2 off margarita as advertised. This place used to be good. Friends fish tacos were not good, and they did give 50% off his tacos because of it."}
{"text":"This is the best place for dirty hairy sloppy tasteless mexican food. We dined in and had the worst experience for any chain. Upon entering,it smelled like it hasn't been cleaned in a month. The restaurant was not busy when we arrived,and we had to  wait  to be seated. Upon being seated, we ordered drinks. Chips and  salsa did not arrive until our meal arrived.  We had a visible dark curly hair in our meal. I had a piece of avocado skin in my guacamole. I noticed there was food on walls near our table. They didn't have covers for the kids cups, nor kids cups. The management should seriously consider an overhaul of their day to day practices. This restaurant would never pass the health standards of the health department."}
{"text":"Oh...heck, no...never again!

Went there on a Sunday afternoon around 1PM with my daughter.  The family in front of us was seated quickly, and then they turned to us and said, \"Would you like to sit in the bar?  It's faster in there?\" We quietly sat down, opened the menus and then said \"What the H?????\"  We didn't go to Garcia's on a Sunday afternoon to SIT IN THE BAR and have FOOTBALL as our entertainment!  We got up, told the hostess she made a very poor decision in asking us to sit there and we left.  Did I mention that there were only about 4 tables with patrons at this time?  I don't know what that was about but I can tell you it's the last time I'm going to Garcias!"}
{"text":"Manager Kylie Miller is awesome!! On 1hour notice on a Saturday afternoon she was able to help us set up for a birthday party (original planned location had a fire and didn't notify us).  Kylie helped get our area set up and ready for a party of 15! Food was great as well. Thanks for saving the day!!"}
{"text":"This IS the best Mexican food restaurant in the valley. I was seated instantly on a busy night with my family, was given hot chips and cold drinks after a few seconds, then all our food was delivered after a good 15 minutes and it was THE BEST food I have ever eaten. I can't wait to come back for my birthday."}
{"text":"This is not Mexican food...this is mid-west flavorless food served with chips and tomato sauce to dip with."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we used to come here alot with my parents but recently I gotten food poisoning from here. I feel the resturant needs to do a better job inspecting their food and making sure their food has been properly washed etc. I won't be back and there's better selections right around the area."}
{"text":"I cannot justify giving them more than 4 stars because there was nothing standout fantastic about it. The service, food, and salsa were all just good. I'd prefer going to a non-chain Mexican food restaurant, but it's fairly close to our house. Overall, it was a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Exactly what you'd expect from a Garcias, mediocre food from a chain. However, John, our server, was amazing and took great care of us!"}
{"text":"We have given this restaurant several chances but now we are done. Very slow service and the food is nothing special. Salad was soggy with huge chunks of iceberg lettuce. We wanted to sit outside but all of the tables were dirty. Need to hire more busers and more staff overall. I have many other places to spend my money where the food is good and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"This is a follow up review.  We have actually been there numerous times since the original review. 

In my opinion, they have one of the best sour cream chicken enchiladas in town.  Abuelo's is also great but different.  

Service was outstanding.  Our server Alex greeted us immediately and took our drink order.  She answered all of our questions and kept our tea filled.  She checked on us a couple of times and did a great job and she was very pleasant.  

Not sure if they changed the charro bean recipe or not...but they were great. Had a strong hint of cilantro that I didn't remember from before. 

If you go in ask for Alex...and the sour cream sauce."}
{"text":"It's sad to see how far downhill Garcia's has gone down over the years. I grew up near the original family's restaurant in Scottsdale. I was disappointed when they were sold to the chain, but it was at least decent for a while. We went there last night after not having been to Garcia's for quite some time, and it was very disappointing. The service was indifferent at best. The salsa and chips were not only not very flavorful, but slightly sweet--as were our entrees. Looking around I noticed almost all the clientele were senior citizens. It appears they have adjusted their recipes to suit this much older crowd, cutting the spices and adding sugar. It was almost like those who work there know that Garcia's is not real Mexican food anymore, and that their heyday has long gone."}
{"text":"Been looking forward to coming here for a while and was disappointed on several levels. We joined their email club and received an email coupon good for a free appetizer with an entree purchase. We specifically asked if there were any restrictions before ordering and were told no. So we ordered the appetizer platter and shrimp fajitas. Both came out at the same exact time, which is not how you are supposed to be served. Secondly, the fajitas vegetables were completely burnt. Not just a little over done but solid black chunks of carbon. After the server finally came back we pointed out the vegetables were burnt and she brought out some none burnt vegetables but by this time the shrimp were no longer hot. The final disappointment came at the end when we noticed on the bill that the appetizer was not free and only $9.00 of the $11.49 was covered. We brought this to the servers attention as we had specifically asked to avoid this kind of situation to which the response was \"I just push buttons on the register\". I don't see us returning any time soon!"}
{"text":"Has gotten bad. This place used to be pretty good. My oldest son had his very first cheese quesadilla here 6 years ago when he was in a high chair. It is so sad what it is like here now and we won't be returning. Our party of 3 was sat with two plates for the chips and two sets of silverware. When ordering drinks, I specified the two children needed cups with lids. I wanted water, no lemon. Out came adult glasses with no lids, water with lemon. My youngest ordered grilled cheese and applesauce. The sandwich he received was toasted bread with what looked like two translucent squares of wet, greasy, yellow wax. He was also given fries. While waiting for them to remake it, my older son needed a refill of lemonade. My youngest one's new grilled cheese came out and it looked like the bread had been painted yellow. Needless to say he had lost his appetite. When I asked if my oldest son's lemonade refill was coming, the server said, \"Yeah, I told you it was.\" So I mentioned my youngest was supposed to get applesauce, not fries. The whole meal it literally felt like the waiter was deliberately doing the opposite of what I was wanting. We weren't even offered dessert. I ordered one fried ice cream for the 3 of us to share. The server asked if we wanted honey on it and I told him no, how about some caramel and chocolate. The ice cream was rock hard like it had been in a deep freeze, was sitting on a soggy fried tortilla, and was topped with chocolate, caramel AND honey. The manager decided to \"comp\" my youngest son's grilled cheese for all our trouble. Thing is, he never got anything to actually eat. So I asked if they could make him a cheese quesadilla to go as I really didn't feel like cooking this night, hence the reason we came out to eat. They came back with his quesadilla packed up to go. Boy, am I glad I took a look at it before we left. It was dripping with grease, not even cut. It was a mess. I showed the manager and told her I guess I'm going home now to cook my son some dinner. So sad this place has gone WAY DOWNHILL. P.S. Don't expect to actually be greeted when you walk in. They'll be too busy doing something else."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. The waiter didn't even know if our table was his or not! I know Friday's can get busy but all restaurants know that and should plan! This one obviously didn't! I have been here in the past and it was great but this time.........not all that thrilled."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  Not bad but not great. I have had the burritos and flautas which are passable and will work in a jam.  Wife likes the place and kids eat for a buck on Sundays.  

It is ok."}
{"text":"Happy hour and quesadillas! Literally the best quesadillas I've ever had. Enough said! Thank you and good night!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time. Great server, however dirty dishes were on the table at arrival. The food was subpar and the amount was minimal. The rice was crunchy and salty. The beans taste like they were out of a can. Unfortunately it was my first and last visit."}
{"text":"This restaurant hands down has the worst service of any restaurant I have ever been to in my life! We love the food and come here at least once a week but always on a day we have nothing else to do. Trust me your server will forget about you! If management worked on the service this place would be great!!! Until then, I would recommend going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Service and good were phenomenal. Anyone downplaying this place needs hit the the face with a monkey wrench. We are from ILLinois and came here on vacation. Loved it. Went to Agave in Flagstaff. That place was shit compared to here. Bottom line."}
{"text":"Not the best service today at this location. Our wait person (Fabian) was pretty much non existent throughout the meal. We actually saw the manager more than him. There were actually more managers and hosts than wait staff.  It was a good thing we had time to kill today! Probably won't visit this location again."}
{"text":"We had dinner there tonight.  Chips were ground corn, food service chips that were not fresh.  The salsa ranked a 5 out of 10; no heat, no garlic, no fresh cilantro, no character.  The bean dip was also a 5; bland.  We had two of their premium margaritas, also a 5.  The espinaca con quest was better, maybe a 7 but with the same chips we didn't each much of it.  I had a chicken taco and a shredded beef enchilada and the wife had pollo fundido.  The chicken taco was quite good, let's call it an 8.  The shredded beef enchi was brought down to a 6 by a weak canned red sauce.  The wife said she liked the pollo fundido but ate less than half of it.  Both entrees were accompanied by beans and rice; both were better than average.  Service was lackluster.  The kitchen area and bussing activities were MUCH noisier than any other restaurant I can remember. The constant crashing of dishes and glasses was way too loud and truly annoying.  The manager was no where to be seen.  It will be really difficult for me to go back to this place and I would definitely not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Ordered Carne Asada tacos, they brought us pork instead of beef. Carne = Beef 

The server tried to argue that carne is all kinds of meat. They must have run out beef, or had too much pork to get rid off. Not going back. Terrible!"}
{"text":"Food not so good - waitress was nice and made it at least worth our time. We were there for a group bday party and they didn't even have it together in the back, a bday cake was brought in and they couldn't find it, their power went out on their credit machine so we had to wait even longer to leave to the next place we had to go. You would think they would have things in place for situations like this!! The manager was even there but didn't seem to know how to do things .  , just overall disappointed ."}
{"text":"Wonderful staff, delicious food, & pleasant atmosphere authentic to culture. I was served by Kathryn and she was very helpful and friendly. The food is the best I've eaten from an actual Mexican restaurant and their prices are more than fair. Great little hidden restaurant with a lot of customers! Family friendly and people in general for this area of town are friendly too."}
{"text":"The free Chips and salsa were the best part of our meal. Ordered the tortilla soup and Pollo fundido and everything came out room temperature.   Twice our server asked is if we would like more chips and salsa, twice we said YES and we never did get them. And dont sit on the patio, you will have to fight of the flies."}
{"text":"So I went with a friend and right off the bat our waiter seemed preoccupied with something else. Not sure what it was, but it wasn't us, the place wasn't even busy...ANYWAYS besides the service the food was great and the atmosphere was very... southwest?  haha... Spanish? Haha, if you go to a Mexican food place you know what I'm talking about."}
{"text":"Garcia's has long been our favorite Mexican restaurant and we go here often. Tonight we ordered take out and am super disappointed. The online menu lists no prices, my bill was way more than I had expected and they got my order wrong. When I called them to resolve, I was put on hold for over 5mins before I hung up. Called back and asked the manager to call me but no response. I won't be back here anymore."}
{"text":"My husband and I have ordered garcias through doordash a few times and the food has been great. We've even picked it up at Ocotillo and Arizona ave and again the food is amazing. Tonight, we just picked up food at the Warner restaurant, and our experience is definitely different. Unpleasant really.  I was left on hold for almost 5 min, which would have been fine if they were busy. But my husband called them also while was on the phone still waiting, and they were ready to take his order.  When we ordered, I specifically asked if certain sides would be included in a fajita meal. They said yes. I then requested for corn tortillas for that meal, but the staff said they didn't have corn tortillas, just flour. When my husband picked it up, he asked about the corn tortillas since we've gotten it before at the Arizona ave restaurant. The young lady told him that they do have corn tortillas, but the chef only makes it for tacos. Think about that for a second. So that means that they could not fry it and just heat it up and give it to customers upon request. However, according to the young lady, that couldn't be done. The final product, the fajita steak meat was dry/overcooked, hardly any vegetables and dry, and the fajita sides (sour cream, guacamole, Pico de gallo) was forgotten. Again, unpleasant."}
{"text":"My parents have been coming here for years and Gary is their favorite server. He is a good man and has been through a lot. His customer service is outstanding!

The food is good and I like to mix the tomatillo green salsa with their mild red.  I always overeat the beans and chips and salsa so I usually order an app and I am full.

My favorite apps are the cheese crisp, the pico chimichangas with the delicious jalepeno sour cream, and the black bean soup. For entrees the green corn tamale, pollo fundito and any of the combos are great. The olivia platter is easily sharable between two people.

I never leave room for dessert but am tempted by the sopapillas and fried ice cream.

My only complaint is the mints they have near the door. I don't like the key lime flavor."}
{"text":"So let me start with the note that the food was excellent. A family friend and I went to lunch and it was totally affordable! I had the cheese enchilada, beans, and rice. It was amazing and my friend was very satisfied with her meal. However, the service was AWFUL! We asked for salsa a few times because the salsa was amazing! Every time they came to our table they'd kind of \"toss\" or roughly slam the small bowl down. The woman who sat us and took our drinks was very soft spoken, when my friend asked what she said the woman scoffed and rolled her eyes and said louder and slowly like we were stupid. When our food came I was trying to make room and the waiter still went ahead and tried to put the plate down which burnt my arm. It wasn't a horrible burn it was more like a small ouch and a red spot that went away. After she burnt me and I jerked my arm away she slammed the plate down a bit rough and smiled at me and told me 'careful the plates are hot' and left. 
I work in retail and I understand some customers are irritating and can ruin your whole day but in the end customer service determines your customer flow. I definitely won't be coming back to this Garcia's. The food was excellent but didn't make up for the horrible customer service."}
{"text":"This place used to be great, but it's only so-so now.  The formerly excellent charred salsa is gone in favor of a hotter version of the same Pace Picante they've always served, but is mostly just spiced tomato paste.  The wait staff is still courteous, but the kitchen messed up my order, which is a first.  Their beer tap is very uninspired, with no local (or actually any) craft beer available.  They never once offered to refill the chips and salsa.  Really disappointed."}
{"text":"The restaurant is very nice, cool patio, and plenty of parking.  As Mexican resturants here go I think it's fine. The food is not at all spicy so it's a good place to take those friends and family members who can't take the heat.  The lunch portions for the combos are huge.  So on the Yelp system we should be at or around a 4 star review, but the last time I went the service was painfully slow.  We were the first in the restaurant and I think the last to be served one day for lunch.  So I have to take away a star for spending an hour and fifteen minutes getting lunch here. Maybe I should have told them I was a Yelper like the other reviewers :).
Hopefully it was just a one time thing.

Try:
- Lunch combo ( be hungry )
- Bean Dip and Chips"}
{"text":"I really like the chicken tortilla soup here and their Pollo Monterey is delicious! Steak is ok, chip and dips are good. Portion side is madness, feels like one entré can serve two."}
{"text":"I was really looking for some authentic Mexican, but because of time and location had to settle. I knew better but went in anyway. The restaurant was not busy but service was a little off. My wife and I were seated at a table too small for my children. We had a craving for margaritas and shared a pitcher. It was good. Nothing else was. The salsa was bland like ketchup and we asked for an extra Jalapeno and never got it. The \"Flautas\" rolled in flour tortillas were corn taquitos. The Green Chile Pork Chimi was filled with flavorless stew meat and was soggy. Had we not enjoyed our margaritas we probably would have not eaten and gone to Taco Bell. This is probably a good restaurant for Snow Birds with no palate, but for true Southwesterners it was horrible."}
{"text":"I've gone to Garcias multiple times but this specific location has given me some troubles. While the food is good the service does not match. I had an issue with my order and couldn't eat it and the server did not come back to check on us until everyone else had finished their meal. Needless to say my entire meal went to waste due to lack of service, and not ringing in the order correctly."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, and overpriced for what it is ($10 taco salad was a joke)...  Admittedly I was debating between a 3-star and a 2-star, since we had pretty decent service.  Would I go back?  Perhaps, for appies, and without the kids...and if we're hungry and nearby.

I normally have more to say, but this place totally didn't wow me, even with a $5 off coupon."}
{"text":"The three stars is for the menu and not the service. The service was good even though it was just after church on a Sunday and the place was slammed. They did a great job even though slightly understaffed at the time we were there. There are plenty of choices on the menu and the food quality was fine as far as freshness is concerned. The thing I didn't like was the overall blandness of everything. If you have relatives in town and they cry whenever anything is too spicy then Garcia's is the place for them. If you want something memorable go somewhere else. I've been to Garcia's twice but it's not my go-to place for Mexican food. That being said if you want a good and stiff margarita then order the Royal at Garcia's. The trade off is that the prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is decent. I'd still eat there again."}
{"text":"We ate here twice recently, and had huge plates of delicious food, including the basics, like tacos and their yummy and elaborate appetizer plates.  Really, you could just order appetizers and have more than enough to eat.  We ordered the fried ice cream for dessert again, and was sooooo good.  Outdoors can get crowded, but we were seated right away inside.  Service was great, and we were happy to use a 50% off coupon!  We'll be back...."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. The chips are too large for dipping adequately and a salsa bowls are too small for dipping adequately. The bean dip on the table as a nice touch but that's about where it stops. If you don't look at the floor the decor isn't bad but the concrete floor makes you feel like you're eating in a restroom. I tried the green chile which was apparently pork, and if I'd known it was green chile pork not green chile beef I wouldn't have ordered it at all it was generally Bland and uninspired also tried the Pollo fundido which is their signature dish and I found that bland and uninspired as well the chicken and the pork both were lacking any sort of spice or flavor. I won't be back. All of the food I found to be Bland and unremarkable. Furthermore the waitress only stop back once throughout the entire meal our salsa Bowl was not full nor was our chips bowl full. Finally their beans are weird the refried beans are the wrong color they're not the right color of brown. And Bland as well. And if you order Double Bean's because you don't want the rice and they bring you a pile of lettuce instead of the extra beans that's just robbery."}
{"text":"Just don't bring yourself to do it. There are better Mexican restaurants within 30 feet.
Service is terrible. Good luck getting drunk refills, sides of anything, the check, silverware, or a drink delivered in under 20 minutes. 
The food is halfway decent but nothing to search out. 
With all of the other Mexican places around Chandler, just drive the extra 2 minutes and look for something better."}
{"text":"I would say food was just ok Definitely better options out there. Tried the sampler chimis, tacos, pollo fundido and flautas. The only one that was good was the pollo fundido and that's prob because it was very cheesy and i love cheese.

Salsa and bean dip they give were good but nothing outstanding.

Prices were normal for a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Great huge patio when the weather is cooler. Nice menu with lots of options. Atmosphere inside is just ok. I love the spicy bean dip that comes with the chips."}
{"text":"Garcia's is a festive little place inside a strip mall, neutral beige color outside but an explosion of Mexican colors inside. The amber-filtered lighting in the bar/counter area and booths/tables is a cozy contrast to the adjoining patio, which exudes with sunshine and a hanging decorative bulbs in the evening. I recommend the latter for a nice outdoorsy Fall meal and that you grab a table on a Friday Happy Hour as soon as you get there. I was told the patio could be really crowded and noisy when High School kids from nearby congregate after school.

Greeters and waiters/waitresses were attentive and overall did a good service. Food is average to say the least; they get points for plate presentation but lacks a kick of Mexican flavors that i would normally find at Moreno's. Safe bet to order are the El Grande Fiesta which consists of flautas, chimis and cheese quesadillas, and the fajita quesadilla with chicken which i thought is a decent meal for a reasonable price. The house margarita is ok too but it is not unforgettable. We were there from 5-10 on a Friday and i was really pleased at the casual atmosphere on the patio. The food may not have won me over on my first visit but i'll definitely be giving it a try and be looking for a seat at the patio again."}
{"text":"I love Garcia's for their nachos and margaritas. Unfortunately, the service was poor."}
{"text":"Good solid boring generic Mexican food at a fair price.  We come here for two reasons.  My acquaintance loves their charro beans and other menu items.   And they don't cook with disgusting lard and state it on their menu.   So every now and then this is where we come.  The service is just fine.  It's a tiny bit run down and there is always dust on the ceiling and trellis gazebo wooden thing.   Some of the booths are way too small to fit me.  The food is good.  It's nothing fancy, or boutique, or with any type of flare.  Almost along the lines of the 24 hour taco shacks, but better and fresher.   It's comfort food with minimum frills.    Besides that, looks like they are strictly enforcing a no coupon with happy hour items policy.   I get it.  But what's really annoying is that it's 5.50 for a regular priced beer.    Fortunately there are tons of great Mexican restaurants to choose from!"}
{"text":"Very fantastic place to eat service's was fast. Food is always on point.! Kid friendly menu and coloring things todo on the flip side. With having kids sometimes they can be picky. Glad they make really good chicken tenders. Thank you for fast and friendly service. Price is reasonable for a family of 4. If your looking to get that craving out of the way come here!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the food I had at Garcia's.  To start out the meal the salsa and beans were beyond spicy. I like spicy foods. They were hot!  I requested enchilada sauce it was hot. The only thing I can figure is low volume of sales during  the post holidays so the chiles had more time to steep.   I have had Garcia's before and it wasn't that spicy. 

I ordered Chile Colorado and it was salty.  I tried to eat it and thought it was just me.  I thought \"I'll take it home, someone will eat it.\"  When I was boxing it up my table mates said, you didn't eat the anything\".  I said that I thought my tasters were off because it was too salty. They tried it and had to napkin it.  So I didn't take it home. When the waiter came up and remarked that I wasn't taking it home I told him that it was too salty.  Nothing.   Add to all of this the dish came with flour tortillas and I would have chosen corn, I ordered some corn and was charged.  Not good.   I had been to Garcia's a couple of years ago and the experience was fine.  Not this time."}
{"text":"Hey I came here for a dos equis on draft and was surprised by (a) the really nice vibe and excellent layout of the restaurant (the one on Warner Rd.), the great and respectful service, and the awesome chips (really, just great) and bean dip and salsa (excellent). I haven't had other than the beer-and-vibe-and-chips test so your mileage may vary!"}
{"text":"Food was okay but won't return.  Wasn't busy but felt like they were very understaffed.  Had to ask for utensils several times after the food arrived.  Never offered drink refills.  Outdoor lights, only 1 of 1 of 24 worked, yes I counted them.   It was a weird terrible experience."}
{"text":"Sat down on a Tuesday last night around 6 not crowded outside. When the chips came I ordered a side of guacamole for my chips 10 minutes later the waitress starting taking are orders I said I am still waiting on my guacamole she said it was coming so I also ordered a side of jalapeno sauce for our dinner so 10 minutes still waiting on guacamole after 20 minutes I went inside and told them to cancel my guacamole I had already eaten my chips. Then 35 minutes later they brought out the guacamole and sat it on the table after we had already canceled. When my dinner came she brought out a side of sour cream not jalapeno cream sauce. And that point I did not say anything yes they charged us for the guacamole and sour cream. Then the manager brought a beer over to r table not to me someone else and said i thought you might be ready for another he said i did not order another beer. Which would have been great if were not getting ready to leave."}
{"text":"Nasty. Disgusting. Too much alcohol. Gross.  Yuck. Go. Somewhere. Else. RUN!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service, but the speed of service could use some work."}
{"text":"Any time I am in Arizona, I go to Garcia's. I think that they have the best authentic Mexican food in town. I recommend getting one of the sampler plates or at least one of he chimichangas. I'm only giving four stars because it took an incredibly long time at this location to get menus and our order taken. Aside from having to get up and ask for menus and drinks--everything else about the experience was great! Eat at Garcia's!"}
{"text":"Awesome food every time we go. Great service. Best salsa than any place I've been! Love it!"}
{"text":"The server was very shy, and probably new. Very slow service, forgetful and lacked follow thru."}
{"text":"Don't bother! Not only was the food not so good, but also the service was TERRIBLE. The inside is a little shabby, my seat was moving every time I adjusted (bench seat in a booth), and the service took forever. We ordered nachos that took about 20 minutes to come out and were cooled down a lot by the time we received them. We also had to ask the host to get our server just to pay the bill. If the food or the service is amazing then I am ok, but it was neither :(."}
{"text":"This restaurant is conveniently located in Chandler but does not keep up with cleanliness. In fact, their patio dining tables are disgusting!  They are so filthy, we have moved inside the restaurant twice because no one in our party would agree to have food served on it. The bar staff has one bartender who works hard but the rest of them are worthless. Ignoring the tables they should be responsible for which is very frustrating when you need something from them. We are very surprised that they don't have a ton of health code violations against them. Our suggestion, go to Abuelos in Chandler, a much classier and better managed Mexican restaurant."}
{"text":"Love that you can order pick up! Service is good, margaritas are tasty, and environment is welcoming. 

The green salsa enchiladas never disappoint."}
{"text":"I would like to give a huge thumbs up to this location.  I go in for my lunch break which is one hour and they always get me in and out on time.  There lunch menu is awesome, everything I have tried on it is delicious.  I love the chicken chimichanga.  I just want to say thank you for great food and impeccable service."}
{"text":"Ordered from this location on Postmates. So much worse than the AZ Mills restaurant, which we order from often. Everything tasted awful. One of our orders was wrong and both meals went into the trash. Even the chips were too salty to eat. Will never eat at this location again."}
{"text":"We've dined here twice with the same results. Overall food quality and service are? just average and not memorable?. The Chandler location furniture is? worn down and a bit unappealing. Even though the air-conditioning was under repair that day, it wasn't noticeable.  Unfortunately, with the volume of Mexican restaurants here, Garcia's doesn't merit another return trip for us."}
{"text":"Horrible waiting staff/customer service, mediocre food. My rating is based on the food. The have a fantastic hot salsa."}
{"text":"I don't expect to have great Mexican food here when I visit, but it does in a pinch, and visit often due to the convenience of the location.
The service is so slooooow. I don't think we have ever had anyone come and check with us during our meal. Not to mention I have not seen the same wait person more than once. I pay attention to that kind of thing.
Make sure you ask for the \"hot sauce\", it is good."}
{"text":"If you like Mexican food and great service, this is the place.  I have been here several times and the food and service have always been great.  Our waitress was very friendly, we received our drinks right away and dinner was exactly what I ordered without looking at the menu.  It was an enjoyable evening with family."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided on mexican food for dinner.  We had not been this Garcia's location  (tempe) in ages.  We arrived Round 5:00 on a Saturday night.  We were seated right away.  The server was quick to the table and we ordered our drinks, then began to review the menu.  We then ordered our food and waited.  The server was not very attentive and a bit short when we asked her questions.  We were done with our entree (I asked for a box to go) she then proceeded to give us the check.  Did not ask if we needed anything else, just seemed to want to move the table.  However, it was not busy and no waiting for tables at the front. Food was good but felt like we were more of an inconvenience to our server. Not sure we will be going back.  There are so many other good choices for mexican food."}
{"text":"Slow service, tacos were greasy, some of the food was served lukewarm!"}
{"text":"After our first visit, we received a message from the management.  They were clearly not happy with the comments and they let me know the changes they made to address the issues.  Clearly the sign of a team that cares.  Based on their desire to correct the issues, we gave the restaurant a second chance.  Our second experience was very different.  The food was very good and the service was extremely attentive.  We will return."}
{"text":"Gave Garcia's 3 out of 5 stars due to the less than great service and the appetizer plates that were given to us dirty. Our server let our drinks completely run out (I.e., iced tea, water). We had to keep asking for things. She always got us what we asked for but had to keep asking. She was not a proactive server in any way. When we told her that the appetizer plates were covered in old food, she didn't apologize - just brought us new ones. We also had to ask for more chips. I have not been to a Mexican restaurant yet that hasn't either automatically brought you more chips and kept your beverages filled. I was surprised that at Garcia's we had to continue to ask for things."}
{"text":"We went to this place to visit a friend who was working and decided that we would have lunch as well.  I am normally a picky person when it comes to Mexican food but this place was actually A-Ok in my book.  Is it 100% authentic, probably not but they do have some things that are actually pretty good and decent.  They start you off with chips, salsa and some kind of bean dip.  The salsa was good but the bean dip I thought was amazing!  I had the red chili burrito with rice and charro beans.  The burrito was good, the chili had good flavors.  The charro beans were good as well but the rice was a little overdone.  My bf had the chicken/steak fajitas which looked and smelled really good.  There was a ton of food left over that he took half of it home!

The decor is really nice and they have a beautiful outside patio.  If you go there sit in Rich's section, he will take care of you!  Oh and thank you Garcia's for putting an extra large bottle of Chalula on the table!"}
{"text":"Food is good.  Service wasn't too good.  Tables not cleaned quickly.  The food that had fallen on the table by the prior customer was just quickly swept to the floor with a rag that didn't smell very good.  Hard to get the server's attention. Server forgot to bring one drink and Served one beer in a cracked glass. Didn't have enough glasses to serve us.  Only had small foam take out trays rather than larger ones.  But... The food was good."}
{"text":"I decided to try this spot with the family. I was a bit worried as this location has been a revolving door for businesses. 

The first thing you notice is a truly amazing covered patio, you should come here on a nice day.

The menu has no real surprises, but there is a nice local location section on the back with more unique items. One such item was the avocado enchiladas. Two wih sides for about $12. They were great and a nice break from the usual cheese and spinach enchiladas.

The bean dip here is vegetarian and has a nice spice note. The chips are thin restaurant style. 

Overall I was quite pleased."}
{"text":"This is the only mexican restaurant within 10 miles of my house that I would recommend to anyone.  I've been to it about 8 times in the past year and have never been disappointed nor have my guests.  The menu and prices are pretty much typical of family oriented mex restaurants but the food is above average and pretty consistent.  The very first time we visited, soon after it opened, one of the co-owners came by and talked to us.  From what he said it's one of several restaurants owned by his family who are headquartered in TX (I think that's where he said).

One thing people need to know about \"Garcia's\" chain is that they are NOT all alike.  Some are definitely better than others.  The original Garcia's is at 35th Ave near McDowell Rd in Phx and while popular the food at the original is sub-par.  So don't let your experience at another one prevent you from trying this one.

I generally get a green burro and that's what I've gotten here.  And it's very good.  My wife usually gets a red burro and is very happy with those.  The meat is in chunks and usually there is plenty of it.  The gravy it swims in is good.  The only knock I have about the green burro is that the green chilies in the mix, like so many mex restaurants, is a bit overcooked.  Others in our party had fajitas and thought they were  very good.

There chips are above average and they serve a decent salsa and a bean dip with the chips.  The bean dip is tasty.  The service has been good to excellent.  The other restaurant I recommend in the tempe/mesa area is Rosita's.  There is also a Rosita's in Phx but it's different people.  The one in Phx is also good but the food there is MUCH hotter, usually too hot for out of town folks who have never had what we here call \"real mexican food\"."}
{"text":"This Garcia's is the worst one I've ever been to. My family and I go to Garcia's often. This location always has terrible service. \"Kelsey\" is a slob of a waitress and looks like she just rolled out of bed. She was right when she told us \"she was the worst of her staff\". Kelsey has a piss poor attitude with no clue of what good quality customer service is. Her manager \"Maggie\" was on duty at the time and said Kelsey's behavior was acceptable. If you ever want terrible service from a fat slob waitress please go here. My family and I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We have tried this restaurant a few times. Unfortunately one time was when all my relatives were visiting. I had been to the Garcia's in Phoenix years ago and had great memories, so I expected it to be great. It was a big disappointment. Our enchilada sauce tasted like barbecue sauce. Everyone in our party was very disappointed in the food, and my husband and I paid for it, so it must've been really bad for them to complain about free food!  We tried again and the food was so bad tasting I couldn't even eat it. And I'm a really hungry girl who loves Mexican food!  Too bad it's not like the old Garcia's I remember since it's 2 min from our house. I wouldn't chance it again, though."}
{"text":"You would think that the restaurant manager here would read some of these reviews and attempt to make improvements based on the reviews. But not a chance. I have now attempted this restaurant two times and both times have been so disgustingly disappointed with the service, the food, and the attitude of the servers that I will never darken their door again. The food is less than mediocre and the service is worse than that. The kid that took my order the second time clearly has no experience as a server and doesn't know what the heck he's doing. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this place until it shuts down or gets new management because I'm telling you it's a waste of time, money, and expectation. To Garcias corporate headquarters, fire the manager here and get somebody who knows how to run a restaurant"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this Restaurant Very Nice decor and Patio  Great Margarita and Chips and Bean dip excellent.  We had a Rest.com Coupon so we had dinner with Perks $15 off $30.  Staff Friendly And Service decent  We'll be back They have a decent Happy Hour as well with half off Appetizers and House Drinks (can't be used w coupon ) of course but good to know about"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite mexican food restaurants.  I love the Chimichanga from here.  Super tasty"}
{"text":"The bean dip was good.  That was it.  Everything else was just bad.  To be fair we showed up for an early dinner, 4pm on a Saturday, which is pretty much the worst time you can go to a restaurant.

The service was slow, but I expected that due to the time we arrived.  What I did not expect was way overcooked tamales, cheese enchiladas that were somehow actually bad.  Beef tacos that were inedible.

My shredded beef enchilada was decent.  I know this is not supposed to be super amazing Mexican food.  It is supposed to be OK americanized and somewhat boring mexican food.  After we left, I told my wife that half way through the meal, I wondered if I was going to get food poisoning.  She remarked that she had thought the same thing."}
{"text":"I love Garcias. This location is great because there is never a wait and everyone is very nice. I always get the 3 combo plate for $12 with a chile relleno (they make the best rellenos), a pork burrito and chicken burrito. I eat the relleno while I am there and the other two burritos the next day. Its a ton of food for a very good price."}
{"text":"The food was good. However, I'm so terribly disappointed in the service. I have never been treated so poorly ever. I work very long hours in the car business. And Friday nights are the only night my wife and I can enjoy a \"date night\". Last night I got home a little late because I was working a deal. We have been talking about going to Garcia's for a while. We arrived at 930pm. The restaurant closed at 10pm. The waitress was extremely short. She slammed our food down. She had an irritated attitude with us the whole time. We have never felt so rushed and uncomfortable in a restaurant. Our waitress never asked if we wanted anything for desert. We had been wanting fried ice cream for quite a while. Instead, she dropped off the check and turned her back on us and bolted away. 
I understand we might have shown up a little late. As a car sales professional, I too work in a retail setting.  And I appreciate every customer that gives me the opportunity to earn their business. Maybe Garcia's and this waitress don't need my money. I'm sorry for bothering you last night. I just figured in today's economy, we all could use the business. 
I will never return to any Garcia's Restaurant ever again. From now on I will only bring my business to Abuelos. They have always given me the absolute best service. And the good also is incredible."}
{"text":"This is one of my absolutely favorite restaurants... my favorite salsa for sure... but I ordered chips and salsa to go and it took 20 minutes for them to just being it out... No cooking involved... massive orders coming out but I couldn't get something simple. I had other food in the car that got cold because of it... I won't bother again. You lost a customer because of bad service."}
{"text":"The pollo fundito knocked my socks off, along with the house margarita. Gary was our server. He was an older gentleman who was quick on his feet, very personable, and gave us top notch service. We'll be back for the food and to see Gary again."}
{"text":"Ordered thru Ubereats and the food was terrible!  Guacamole was way too hot!  Salsa was too hot to eat!!
Spinach was stringy and gross. Will not be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Well, the minimum wage hike is impacting service and the ability to use coupons. Our server worked hard and we tipped well  but found we could not have happy price drinks and use a discount on two meals. Interestingly the manager offered no discount to keep us a customers yet kept the coupon. Sorry, hard working patrons need a break too. Not going back. Sadness for Tempe as this will decrease clientele and we are regulars. Valley Luna here we come and  that is in Chandler. 
Adjusting a small bit would have gone a long way. Adios !!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was ok. They obviously had their B team wait staff on tonight. Rude, ignored us for stretches at a time, and we seemed more of an inconvenience then a paying customer.  Will be a long time before I am willing to try this place again."}
{"text":"I think Yelp said it best...  meh, I've had much better!  All flavorless other than the ground beef."}
{"text":"Very good food and service. I will definitely return. Mexican food usually is pretty standard to me.Not this time well packed with beef and very tasty. Strongly recommend The atmosphere and appointments were also above average"}
{"text":"First time here,  in the neighborhood,  hungry,  and have time to kill.  
Sat at the bar,  which had Happy Hour daily from 3-7. 

I ordered 2 glasses of wine,  I know. ..yes at a Mexican restaurant,  and a chicken cheese crisp and my bill was $9.99. I scored,  that's a great happy hour."}
{"text":"Mexican food with some history!

Read up on the history of the Garcia's and you can appreciate it more. This obviously isn't the original Garcia's, but it'll have to do.  On a Sunday whim, my bro needed some Mexican food.  Garcia's is actually one of my favorite places to attend because of their bean and salsa dip they offer at every table.  The bean dip is the best!  I ordered their beef tacos and tamales.  The taco itself was nothing to rave about and I was totally disappointed by the tamales.  I've had some bomb tamales and this one didn't pass.  It was too hard and couldn't really taste the beef.  Everyone at the tables ordered drinks and when the bill came we thought we had a deal.  Not with the food I guess.

The service was good, once they knew we were Yelpers!  Arrr! I hate it when my secret identity has been compromised!  The place itself has the old southwest decor and some pretty murals of random Mexican traditional paintings; overall a very beautiful restaurant. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This two star review is ONLY FOR THEIR SERVICE. I give their food 4 stars, however I cannot go any higher in my opinion because of their service. When I was a kid, I grew up on Garcias. It was on Alma School just north of Warner. It is a childhood favorite. When they closed, we didn't go to any other one for quite some time. About a year ago, we found out there is one by us here in south Chandler and were very excited!!

Each and every time we come here, the service is just terrible. I don't understand. From today, we have been a total of 4 times in the past year. Every time, horrible service. The hostesses are not friendly. They are so bland and so unexcited about their job. You don't feel welcome. They always feel bored. 

Every server we have had doesn't listen to us, unfriendly, feel likes we are bugging them when we are just simply providing our drink order. Food has been wrong because they didn't listen. Slow. Cannot handle more than one table at a time and just really take away from the experience. It is really sad. No one is happy there and it is a poorly run restaurant. 

I do have to compliment their food. AMAZING food. BEST shrimp tacos. My Mom has been eating them for years. Generous chips and salsa, great on the refills and just overall good food. Their environment is very comfortable and very open. It is a fun place to be. Just a drab with their people.

Most people would never come back. However, it is a place we enjoy so I am sure we will eat in again, however I think we will mostly just call in our order and do take out to avoid the bad service. I truly hope they see what is wrong and ramp up this place. It could be a lot better in this awesome part of town!"}
{"text":"# of Visits: 4-5
Price: Really fair
Quality: Really good for price, you could even take out the words \"for price\"
Atmosphere: Excellent
Service: There is a cleancut gentlemen behind the bar that has only seen me twice but seems like he knows me and is very cognizant. TOP NOTCH. Professional, courtious, and smart. Again, TOP NOTCH. He also is extremely polite to his fellow workers. Again, TOP NOTCH. 
There is a girl who is the manager and she is very social, and seems genuinely thrilled about her job and her customers.
Notes: I like how they have bean dip with their chips and salsa
Notes 2: I was very pleased and surprised... They had a happy hour at 6:30 on a Saturday - drink and food specials."}
{"text":"I am not impressed of this location. I have had Garcia's before at a different location and enjoyed the service and food. Tried this location, the food was okay. Our service was okay. I don't like to be critical about people but we were very turned off by our server's breath. It is bad if the person furthest from the waiter noticed. I was closest to the server and it just blew in my face. After smelling it I loss my appetite. Not impressed."}
{"text":"We received a door hanger with a coupon for Garcia's, so we decided to give it a try...
Service was excellent,... The food not so much. Both my wife and I,agree very bland, no seasoning at all...."}
{"text":"We love the Garcia's at Ocotillo and AZ Ave.  The food is always fresh and tasty.  Their chips and salsa are the BEST.  This time we ordered through Yelp24 and it was paid for and ready when I got there so all I had to do was walk in and get it.  They even included chips, salsa and bean dip in our to go order.  So awesome!"}
{"text":"the server was very nice, otherwise this would be a two star review. I got the steak fajita quesadilla. I ordered it with no cream cheese, it came with it. the server had it fixed immediately. the replacement was okay. the steak tasted pretty decent. the rice is absolutely awful though. it has WAY TOO MUCH black pepper.. this place is definitely not authentic Mexican food. it's very Americanized."}
{"text":"Took my daughter out to dinner Monday night because I didn't feel like cooking, I'm sure we all have had nights like that. I told her I wanted to check out the new Garcia's that is our area, she said ok, so off we went!

The restaurant from the outside does not look roomy, but once you are in you see that's not true.

I saw on the board their daily special was called an Ajo Grill, so I started to wonder what that was, but took the menu that was handed to me and checked out what other options I had.

Now my daughter, she knew right off the bat what she wanted, cheese enchiladas beans & rice, so when our server came to our table I asked him what the Ajo Grill was, he told me it was Steak or Chicken cut up with peppers and onions cut up on top of a bed of rice served on a skittle grill that came with pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream & tortillas, omg yes that's what I want to order!!

Dinner came, and it was beautifully colored, the red & green bell peppers or orange of the rice, it was very eye pleasing, and it tasted great! I made me some soft tacos with my tortillas and was only able to eat about half of it, but don't worry, it made for a great burrito at home!

My daughter, who turned 21 in June, but was prego and unable to drink, ordered her 1st strawberry margarita, and I giggled when she got carded!

We both wanted dessert, I had been craving Fried Ice Cream, and boy oh boy did their fried ice cream hit the spot! It was covered in chocolate & honey, and who would have thought those were good combos, but omg they were!

We did enjoy our meal; had great service and I do see us coming back!"}
{"text":"Took relatives from out of town for a taste of Mexican food.  I should have read the reviews,  the salsa had no flavor and the chips needed salt and to be heated up.  The restaurant was not full at 5pm on a weekday night and service was very slow.  Got a sampler platter but the amount of meat in each item was very small.  We all got drinks and they were really good.  Also our plate of fajitas was very good.  There is a lot of competition out there, I used to frequent Garcia's so they better fix the problems."}
{"text":"Sat night 6pm restaurant was very busy- we were greeted immediately and sat promptly. Server greeted us immediately. Chips took a bit to get but server was on top of it! We asked a couple times for them and we could tell server was irritated that we had to wait- he ended up walking out with waiter that gave us chips! 
Food came very fast- our ice tea was never empty! Server and manager were at table for refills often! Food was hot and great! 
Garcias did not disappoint! Have to give only 4 stars because at Mexican restaurant we expect chips   and salsa before we order dinner- but good news is that it was handled correctly and that was our only complaint --"}
{"text":"The first time we are here our waitress was rude but the food was amazing. Thank goodness we gave it another try because it's become our Friday night happy hour spot. Love that they give you a large portion of chips with salsa AND bean dip which is really good. They also have a FABULOUS skinny margarita and amazing fish tacos. We have never had a bad meal and thankfully that rude waitress is no longer there. Ask for Vince and you will get the best service. Portions are big enough to take home and to-go orders usually come with chips and dips too! This place is just easy and the outdoor patio is nice especially when a fire is lit in the fireplace."}
{"text":"We go to Garcia's a few times a month. Their food is consistently good as is the service. Their guacamole is really good and you get all you can eat chips and salsa. The outdoor patio is fun. Our favorite server is Alex. She always takes care of us."}
{"text":"Good food! Our server was really good and very accommodating and we didn't have to wait very long for anything. Ordered the fajitas and enjoyed the free cheese crisp from yelp. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but nothing spectacular.  Service was good and fast so no complaints there.  Hope this location makes it unlike the other restaurants there.  It's really a nice neighborhood."}
{"text":"Best time to go is during happy hour 3-7pm otherwise there is better Mexican food for the money!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a whim after a soccer match. 

Party of 7, with 2 kiddos.   

Love their chips, salsa, and bean/cheese dip

Service was just okay."}
{"text":"The Mr. wanted enchiladas, we were in the area, I agreed to try this place out, neither of us had ever been.

He proceeds to order cheese enchiladas with no onions and is told, everything is pre-made with onions!...WTF!! 
I wanted to leave but he decided to try the Fajitas, I got a tostada and tortilla soup. Not even picture worthy. Tasted like premade crap, and La Victoria canned beans!

SO let's just play a fun game with the name here:

Sounds Like: Garcia's

BARFcia's
GROSScia's
Diarrhea's

I think you get the picture.......I would not recommend going here..."}
{"text":"I think this is the worst service I have ever had at a restaurant. We were with a group of about 30 on the patio and the server never came back to take orders, I ended up going to the bar. Dirty dishes and glasses piled up so bad there was no room on any of the tables. Requested to have stuff cleaned up a couple of times, nothing happened. I will never come back."}
{"text":"On my way home from an appointment...running late....lunch hour almost over....starving....and it is taco Tuesday! So I stopped in here for the first time. This place is pretty near my house and I was looking forward to having a Mexican food choice (other than Taco Bell) in the neighborhood. 
The place was pretty quiet...and I was seated right away. My server (who was very nice and efficient) came over, and I ordered the taco special (Two beef tacos, rice and beans) I asked for ice tea with no lemon, and when she brought it, some really tall thin man appeared from the bar and told her she forgot the lemon. The waitress explained I ordered it that way. The man walked away. I had no idea who he was and he never said a word to me through the whole meal, but I assumed he was the floor manager. He must have walked by my table half a dozen times and never spoke....weird. 
Anyway, on to the food. The chips/salsa and bean dip that came out were good...the chips were nice and crisp and the salsa was a little bland, but not bad. However, the taco plate was really bad. The taco shells were hard and the meat inside was so salty I could hardly eat it. The beans were pretty much just liquid...amazingly like the bean dip, so I assume it is the same stuff. Lots of rice and shredded lettuce on the plate..which is not what I really wanted to enjoy! 
All in all, I don't think I will be back, even though they did give me a lunch club card (buy 5 lunches get one free) I had to laugh when I turned the card over I noticed someone had written on the back ...looked like a catering order!! Hope they don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Dude, people in AZ must have no standards for Mexican food. Our friend hyped it up so much and it all was disappointing. At least the chips were good."}
{"text":"Not sure what has happened to this Garcia's.  
The food is now mediocre at best (we had burritos, enchiladas, fish tacos and a cheese crisp).

The food was unappetizing in appearance and taste.  In addition, the service was excruciatingly slow, from the time we were seated to the time we got our check.  The server was nice, but clearly had little training or desire to make our experience memorable.

Not going back, for sure."}
{"text":"Magnifico Margarita is good.  Like the bean dip with the salsa and chips.  Food average.  Weird to have no paper towels in bathroom. Service was slow, but there was a large group on the patio.   Furniture uncomfortable, dirty vents in ceiling were gross. Wife and daughter got the chicken enchilada salad and liked it. I got seafood enchiladas, over cooked but sour cream poblano sauce was good. You can see in picture how edge of beans  and enchiladas are overheating, probably under warmer too long."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. The chips and salsa is great. The decor is nice. I can't really say much about the service because I always order takeout. The food really varies depending on what you order. I think my favorite thing is the Enchiladas Trio. However, the heartbreaking thing is...the Chimichanga. I used to go to Garcia's all the time when I was younger, specifically because I loved their Chimis. Well, something has changed, because it's nothing like it used to be. Plus, my daughter has ordered the shrimp tacos a few times, just hoping they'll be good, and she says it never is. I dunno, maybe we're just ordering the wrong stuff."}
{"text":"Bad service and bad food.  I ordered the chicken fajita's and the chicken was all dark meat and overspiced.  I've had better Garcia's experiences but I'm souring on the chain."}
{"text":"I love eating at Garcia's. I love their bean dip and salsa before you order and I like how you can call and pick up. Plus it's fun to try different dishes but I usually get the seafood fundido"}
{"text":"Went here to this location for the 1st time, looks very nice and smells great as your walking in, great décor, very roomy good for large groups.

1st thing I notice was a dirty plate. I grabbed my plate to put chips on it and it felt ruff flipped it over and it had caked on cheese.

Chips were huge, more like eating Tostada chips but they tasted good. 

Salsa (what salsa) Tomato Sauce and Green Onions, no flavor, no heat. 

I ordered 2 crunchy tacos with rice and beans, plates where hot food not so hot.  It tasted like they used old grease to cook food and my shredded beef was cold on the inside and burnt on the outside, strange taste in lettuce, other than the strange taste it was tasteless. 

On the expensive side, young, flustered waitress not to attentive. 

This is my 3rd time tying Garcia's and 3rd location and Garcia is not for me, I'm no into paying more for no flavor.  Cute restaurant though."}
{"text":"OH BOY!!...where to start with this place. I wouldn't reccommend this place/location to my worst enemy, it was that bad of an experience. Came here last Sunday with my mom for lunch...we were some of the first people to arrive at 11am when they opened. There was one table of about 5 people sitting behind us, they ahd already ordered their food, but were complaining about not getting re-fills in a timely manner (again it was not busy at all). We sat down and ordered diet coke and water...server tells me you wont want the diet its not tasting good today fromt eh machine. I said okay and took a water also. 15 minutes later brings us over our drinks (i get no water, i got the diet coke she just told me was not good), keep in mind the table behind us hasnt even received their re-fills yet that they ordered 10 minutes before us. Finally get to the food order...i knew it wasnt going to be good when the server didnt write down our order, just tried to memorize it. Server asks me how i want my skirt steak cooked...i said extra-well...she thens says okay it will take about an extra 20 minutes or so to cook your steak...i said no problem as we were not in any hurry. Literally 10 minutes later out food comes...my moms is great, mine ohhhhh boy...my steak was ALIVE, i cut into it and it started bleeding and juicing all over my other food. I also got refried beans but asked for black beans. The whole thing was a mess and i knew when i saw our food come out that fast she didnt put the order in correct. Didnt even bother to offer to make another one, just took it from the table. I didnt eat any of my meal at all. Luckily, when i got the bill, all i had to pay for was my mom's meal, but still what a horrible, nasty, unprofessional and gross experience! DO NOT GO HERE...YUCK!"}
{"text":"Here are the LUNCH things we loved: My TORTILLA SOUP was absolutely perfect. Best ever, with the perfect spice level, ingredients and presentation. My wife's chicken CHIMICHANGA was the best she has every had anywhere! The thin fresh TORTILLA chips with salsas (2) was mild enough that we didn't have to order an appetizer. Her CHIMICHANGA can with another fabulous salsa and we finished off the chips going from 1 salsa to the next. I talked my wife into trying some of my TORTILLA SOUP on her CHIMICHANGA just for a taste treat because it didn't need any salsa and she loved it. Yes I was able to try it too and I see why we had NO take homes containers.
Why not a 5? Well we wanted to try a SOPAPILLA and I can truthfully tell you \"Don't even think about it!\" Flat 4 cornered thing that was doughy, heavy and way under cooked. Next time (Yes we are going back) we will try the FRIED ICE CREAM, WARM APPLE FLAUTAS or CHOCOLATE MINI CHIMIS. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Garcia's are all over the southwest. Now we have a new place to stop on our adventure trips."}
{"text":"Amazing service! And amazing food! The staff here is wonderful! I always have them cater events for me & they never let me down. Thank you to everyone at this location for such great service!"}
{"text":"Location is good and a welcome addition to the area.  Menu has the usual options and they seem able to accomodate special request fairly well if within reason.  Service really depends on your server and there have only been a couple familiar faces I've seen there since this location opened. 
Shared an entrée with my spouse after noshing on the chips and salsa.  Oof!  Didn't need half of that but it was tasting so good.
I liked the corn tortillas they used for the chips much better than the ones they use for their mini tacos.  Those things were so hard and thick.
Wish the server we had tonight had made the effort to clear dirty, empty dishes and things not being used from the table.  I felt as if he expected his buser to take care of those details.
It's just one of those things that figures in to the tip.
Overall it's okay here.  A bit o' the Mexican flavor, some ambience, a Margarita or two and it's probably most perfect for your our of town guests."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Tempe. Still the same quality after 20+ years.  Made a trip here just for the pollo fundido and it did not disappoint! Flavourful margaritas. The service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Never coming back!  Ever!!!
Enough said. They should have good servers on Friday nights!!
I wouldn't give them any stars!  Always ask for a good waiter cause service is bad. Everytime we come here its bad! Server was so frustrated with us like it's my fault I didn't get steak in my burrito or my fiance didn't get his rice. He ordered a chicken bowl and he got chicken soup. And waiter telling me I never said \"steak\". Wow, my guy was like, she said steak. Instead, he should of said, I apologize for that etc..but not even that.
I'm over this place! Worst experience and if I even get offered a free meal, I wouldn't even go back for that. They care more about comping your food then take these horrible servers off the floor. Btw, the manager said\" its a hit or miss sometimes on fridays\"..Wow! If I was a manager I would never say that to customers. I  was craving mexican burrito and ended up ordering fish. Night totally ruined!

Honestly, don't know how they are still in business. You complain to the Manager, but you can see that they don't care about the problem or are going to make changes. I had to ask for the Manager \"Twice\". Unbelievable experience!!"}
{"text":"Sunday night. Fairly busy, and there was a fun buzz goin' round the place. We were a party of five and seated fairly quickly.

Chips were fairly decent, and 'twas nice that they give you decent amounts of salsa plus a giant dollop of refried beans to go with 'em.

Drinks came promptly, and they took our food order. This is where the restaurant experience ENDS. LOL.

Most of my group ordered entree's, and I ordered soup. Shouldn't be anything extraordinary about it. Food wait was at least 30-minutes!! 

I will give them these positive reinforcements - 

1. Server was nice.

2. I ordered a tortilla soup, and it was hearty, and a good portion. I ordered extra avocado, and they gave me generous amounts.

3. The server came 'round and noticed that our drinks were empty (ONCE), but it sure as hell took him a long time to come back!!!

Ambience had a fun vibe.
Company was good.
Service was horrible. 
Food was OK. Soup had too much of a tomato-ey base, but it was still OK.

Wouldn't come back unless I had to, though."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food here most of the time but here is a HUGE tip. Plan on asking for your food to go unless you have 3.5 hours to kill waiting for a taco salad and soup.  Terrible service 5/5 times"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been frequent customers at Garcia's in Chandler. Although our experiences haven't been consistently positive, the restaurant has continued to be our \"go-to\" place for Mexican food...until last night. We ordered the Steak and Shrimp. I know, I know...order Mexican food at a Mexican restaurant, and order steak at a steakhouse. But sometimes you want something a bit healthy and grilled. The shrimp were cooked well, and the portions were perfect for sharing, especially after enjoying the chips and salsa. (The bean dip was different from what we were used to...last night's had more heat and was sweetened with sugar, which neither of us liked.) Back to the Steak and Shrimp: The onions were caramelized almost to the point of being burnt, and the peppers were practically nonexistent. Again, the shrimp were tasty and well-cooked. The steak was a different matter. We asked that it be cooked \"medium,\" and I added \"pink inside.\" The first steak was cooked well-done and was completely gray, dry, and tough. Our waitress was kind enough to order another for us. The second one was even grayer, dryer, and tougher than the first. We were comped on the meal, which we appreciated, but we would have preferred to pay full price for a satisfactorily cooked steak, which we were looking forward to. This was the second worst experience we've had at Garcia's. The first was when I ordered the fish tacos and was served a huge piece of fish inside a tortilla, with some dry cabbage on the side--that was it. The aesthetics are also lacking. We sat on the patio, expecting that the fans and the usual misters would keep us cool. However, only a few fans were on, and there were no misters. Some of the light fixtures had broken glass, and the plants were sparse. We'll be seeking out a new \"go-to\" place for Mexican food."}
{"text":"This restaurant is on the corner of Warner and McClintock in Tempe.  The staff is great and the food is delicious!   They have some \"light\" items on the menu, too.  I had the tortilla soup and a garden salad.  Both were excellent.
They also have a great Happy Hour and Open sitting area outside."}
{"text":"We love this place. Best pollo fundido in town. They bring you salsa and bean dip with your chips. Great margaritas; beautiful outdoor patio with fireplace. One of our staple restaurants."}
{"text":"Love Garcias.....


I love going to Garcias. It is one of my favorite Mexican food restaurants in Arizona. They have great fajitas and a fantastic happy hour. The bean dip has slipped some, it used to be much tastier but it is still pretty good. Great margaritas and normally great service. The outside seating is also very nice. I would recommend Garcia's to anyone who wants good Mexican food!


Update....

We just recently celebrated my sisters 30th birthday here. We came out for happy hour so we were able to deal with the whole family being there :) We requested outside patio because it was such a large group and we were interested in the happy hour. We had grandparents that \"couldn't handle the heat\" so they allowed us to eat inside and still get happy hour prices. The server and the manager were very attentive to all 21 needs that we had in attendance. They did such a fantastic job dealing with so many people and made the experience great. No ones food was sent back it was all correct and everyone enjoyed themselves."}
{"text":"Eh, it was alright. The lunch specials come with a huge amount of food- more than enough to warrant a siesta afterwards! I had the red chile burrito lunch ($7.99), which came enchilada-style, with rice and your choice of beans (Refried, charro, black).

We were promptly served chips and our waitress took our drink order quickly once we were seated. The chips were a huge portion and size, served with salsa and refried beans. The red chile was made with large chunks of beef. Although I appreciated that they used whole chunks, they were bordering on the side of being too large to eat with one bite. The whole meal itself wasn't too remarkable, but it had decent flavor and service was good as we made excellent time within our lunch break."}
{"text":"Thank you, Garcia's, for acknowledging my review and offering process improvement.  My husband and I frequent your restaurant on a weekly basis and love the food and the service.  Thanks for your quick response to correct my concern!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Customer service is very important to me and every time I go everyone is so warm and friendly. The hubby is an over tipper which I am very picky as to where we eat. But back to how great this place is because they are family friendly. Besides if my son eats all of his food and mine I know the food is good and he feels comfortable because he cries every time we leave. After having a horrible birthday service elsewhere I thought I'd mention this place because I always comparing other restaurants to this one. Did I also mention that the food is one of thee best Mexican food I've had in Arizona?"}
{"text":"We really like the food at Garcia's.  This was the first time at this particular location but we've eaten at other ones in the past.  

This time there were three of us.  Service was good and food delicious.  We sat on the patio.

We would definitely return."}
{"text":"I like to come here when I don't feel like driving far for Mexican food. This restaurant is very Americanized, but its still decent Mexican food. I enjoy their fajitas, which come out on a sizzling hot skillet, with onions and peppers, with all the side toppings you can think of and of course it's accompanied with rice and beans. Another favorite dish of mine is the pollo fundido. This is basically a chicken chimi with a special sauce on top. I find myself liking the special sauce at Serrano's better, but Serrano's has nothing on the actually dish. Man if I could mix the two, I would be in chicken and special sauce heaven!

The one constant complaint I have about this place is the service. Every time we visit, the waiters and waitresses seem to be distracted by other things, for example games on the TV, other waiters or waitresses, or talking to the hostesses upfront. Your experience can really be ruined by having to wait long time for each part of your meal; it should flow smoothly if you care to do your job correctly. I have never been here when it's packed with customers, its always empty and very laid back, so they definitely have the time to make every table happy. If the service was up to par 4 stars for sure, the only reason I gave it a 3 is because I leave here every time with a HUGE FOOD BABY! Mmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"I have eaten MANY fajitas in my life. Some were mediocre, but most are acceptable. For the life of me, I can't remember any (including ones I've made myself) that compare with the deliciousness of the steak fajitas I had here tonight. 

I was also rather impressed with the affordability of the Magnifico margarita. $10 essentially gets you 2.5 top shelf margaritas (they bring both the glass and the mixing tumbler to the table). 

I'm sad I didn't catch my waitress's name. She was lovely and as I was 1/2 way through my fajitas, she stopped by to ask if I needed more tortillas. That was precisely what I needed, but I was planning on eating the rest of my fixings with a fork and knife as I didn't feel like asking for extra tortillas tonight. Her offer showed both an attention to detail/her customers and made my dinner all that much better. 

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love this place. I judge a place by it's salsa and Garcia's does not disappoint! I am a vegetarian and the spinach enchiladas are amazing! I come here for lunch with co-workers and dinner with my man. I have not ever had a bad experience :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! 

Garcia's is one of my favorite places to go for Mexican food. I can honestly say that I have never had a bad meal here. Fresh ingredients, hot and tasty food, decent service. To start off, we love their chips and salsa and bean dip. These items alone are worth the visit! Chips are served hot along with fresh salsa and a spicy bean dip that I think they make, and if they don't, it's still really good! 

The menu is pretty standard Mexican food items. I usually go for the Grande Burrito. It's made with fajita meats and veges. Comes with Charro beans and rice. Served with Guacamole and sour cream. The fajitas are excellent too."}
{"text":"I've been to a Garcias at another location and I thought the foos and service was just ok. I didn't really have any interest in coming back.
I decided trying them out again after this location was at Liv Avenida apartments for \"Restaurant Review\" night a month ago. At this event residents sample some of their dishes. They had brought the Pollo Fundido which was really good and I've craved it ever since.
I went to Garcias for lunch with a friend and got the Fundido. It was as delicious as I remembered it. Service was good and atmosphere is fun and colorful."}
{"text":"Foods not great, but not bad either. My biggest gripe was asking for sour cream and when I got my check I was charged for it, .99 to b exact. No, .,99 is not a big deal, just principle, but to be on the fair side, a business has to make money. 

For the positive, their margaritas are delicious!"}
{"text":"So I received an email from Ashley Stockton after my review of Garcia's in Glendale. Not my intention, but she sent me some gift certificates as a consolation.  Jen and I had a good experience previously at the Garcia's in the AZ Mills mall but since we were closer to the location on Warner we stopped in there.

I normally wouldn't suggest a steak at a Mexican restaurant but back home we had a place that had a steak plate and the marinade made it great.  Jen and I bother ordered the steak and shrimp preceded by a chicken quesadilla for an appetizer.  First of all, that quesadilla was awesome.  Massively thick and so good.  I know a quesadilla isn't supposed to be rocket science but this was a stand out.  The steak and shrimp was great.  I wasn't overly impressed with the grilled shrimp but they were good. The steak was the bomb.  I don't know what the marinate was but I want the recipe.  It made the steak so tender and it had the perfect level of spicy heat to it. We enjoyed our food so much I was bragging about the steak I had at work on Monday.

I have to add, our waiter was great, and after reading some other Yelp reviews we asked him for a sample of all their hot sauces. The regular they give you with the beans and chips is good.  They have two others you should definitely try.  I mixed and matched them and all combos were good.

Our experience here was enough to make us want to come back."}
{"text":"I have eaten there about 5 times. The food was good, service was good also. The atmosphere is a family type, a little bit of noise, but not annoying. So all in all it was good for me and my family. It seems to be a good place to have a large group go for dinner and not have a 2 hr. wait."}
{"text":"BEST Pollo Fondidos, nowhere else can come close. The Cheese Crisp is also great. I can't say anything about how good the service or is (or any other entree) because I am always enjoying my Pollo Fondido!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Pepsi products to start, which is a HUGE plus in my book.  I love the chips and beans that they have out.  But by far my favorite item on the menu is the Fajita Chinichanga, the Espinacha sauce that goes on top of it is incredible!  We always get good service, often eat here a couple of times a month, and it is one of our favs."}
{"text":"Decided to try Garcia's for the first time. We were seated right away for a Friday evening then it went south from there. The waitress (Alex) was very rude and seemed to be in a hurry to take our order. When I told her we weren't ready she basically stormed off. We asked for more salsa when our cheese crisp arrived and chips and she ignored us. A waiter brought out our main course and asked him for the salsa and he brought it but basically dropped it on our table. We will never go  there again. I would rather go to  Taco Bell and get better service."}
{"text":"Maybe it was better when I was a kid.  Ultimate burrito was just a few slices of steak and sliced bell peppers and onions.  There are better places and maybe theyes need to update menu.  I would rate chipolte burritos better and filaberto tacos better.  They need to update something.  Espos two miles south has little decor but much better food.  I wish Garcias luck.  I want to be a fan again."}
{"text":"Gabby is our server tonight, and she's beyond amazing, very attentive, knows her info about the food and she's really kind! Make sure to ask to have her as your server!!"}
{"text":"We've come here a few times. The food is good but the service sucks. We went to have a late dinner and the server was plainly unfriendly. Seems like we were taking up her time. Never checked on us and my friend mentioned she wanted dessert, the waitress just put our check on the table and left. We had no water and I wanted some sour cream for my dinner and wasn't able to get it, again because she never came around. Yeah, I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"I had a coupon for $5 off a $20 meal and was told that the happy hour price of the Margarita would not be honored because I was using the coupon.  According to the coupon alcohol was not counted toward the discount, so it should not have mattered. The meals were well over $20 and after asking the waiter if he could just separate the bill  with liquor on one and meals on the other, waiter Zach told me Manager would not allow it that way.  What a bait and switch if ever I heard this!  We will not be back and I will also let social media  know how you handle these situations as well.  So unfair and what is the point of the coupon. Better add this information to your useless coupon prior to us ordering drinks and also during dinner time. You don't keep long time customers by treating them this way.  No Class!"}
{"text":"Great food, good portion sizes, reasonable prices, great service.  Spanish music a little loud but we were seated right under the speaker.  Overall great experience and would go again."}
{"text":"Early lunch, had the combo chicken-steak burrito which was delicious. Served with your choice of beans and Mexican rice and chips with dips. The bean dip was bland while the salsa dip tasted fresh. 

Average experience."}
{"text":"I have been to many garcia's before that were pretty good. We were sat next to the only other table that had people, it took an hour to get our food, the service was horrible, my food looked like it had been baking under the heat lamps for 20 minutes, a complaint was met with an EXTREAMLY rude manager, and to top it off I am now horribly ill... Skip this location."}
{"text":"I was very excited when Garcia's opened just minutes from home.  We go frequently for happy hour.  The guacamole is delicious and a steal during happy hour.  They don't skimp on the margaritas either.  The food is pretty good.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  We'll keep going back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I arrived at opening. We were seated quickly, received our drinks quickly, ordering was easy, the food arrived SUPER fast, everything was excellent. Great food and service!"}
{"text":"They have really expanded the menu since the last time we were here. Lots of tasty entrées for you to consider. I had a very hard time choosing. I must encourage you try and Electric Iced Tea, if you're into adult beverages. We enjoyed the Carne Asada Chimichanga & the Enchilada Trio.. DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION---------------The hostess was sitting at the bar and didnt even acknowledge us for a few minutes. Finally, she came over and brought us to our table without saying a word or cleaning it off. She then proceeded to throw our menus on the table and told us to \"enjoy\" while already walking away. We had a coupon for another location apparently, the manager came out and said \"next time.. look at the location on the email\", like we were stupid. (The email had another address but stated nothing about it not being valid at other locations) over all a terrible and gloomy experience from start to finish. We left before even finishing our chips due to the terrible and unwelcoming staff. Avoid this location at all costs."}
{"text":"Great food. Kitchen is not managed well. So much lack of attention to detail. Seats and floors were dirty. Watched the busser miss the silverware on the floor. A little grossed out."}
{"text":"We went to pick up the takeout and they gave us the wrong order. When I called they just wanted me to drag my two children back to pick up the correct order no thanks."}
{"text":"Garcia's is neither Mexican, nor Food.  Anyone wanting authentic Mexican needs to stay away from this and other \"chain\" restaurants.  Here in AZ, you can pretty much throw a rock in any direction and hit a good, family owned and operated Mexican place that's TO DIE FOR.  Stay away from the chains.  A hint?  If it's got orange cheese all over the place, IT AIN'T REAL MEXICAN."}
{"text":"My parents and I always come here since it is down the street from their house. The salsa and bean dip are complementary and awesome to snack on. I normally order the beef street tacos. For lunch today, it was way too much food (or I smacked on too much salsa... Hehe) so I had leftovers! I love leftovers. Lol. Anyway, the tacos come with cilantro and red onion as a topping. My mom and I order the green salsa since we like it better on our tacos. You have to ask or they will only bring out the red salsa. I have had the enchiladas here too which are also delicious and I always have leftovers. Lastly, I had a beer today but I normally order margaritas. They're always delicious and you have a variety of flavors to choose from. 

Overall, I will always have a soft spot for this place. The decor is super cheesy Mexican inspired (of course LOL) but the service has always been great and the food is always what we expect."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great happy hour prices. The bartenders are extremely friendly and the wait staff is very accommodating. The managers are also very approachable and check in on their customers occasionally to make sure their dining experience is great, which it always is. The bean dip is always delicious and the wait staff is always willing to bring more than enough chips, salsa, and dip to the table. The outside dining area is also a great area to sit at as well. I highly recommend sitting outside or in the bar area to anyone who wants great service and delicious food."}
{"text":"I grew up in Arizona and enjoy many different styles of Mexican food. People who know the difference between Sonoran style, Baja style, Santa Fe style, and Tex Mex style Mexican foods understand that this is great food. Garcia's is a great Sonoran style mexican food restaurant. This location is one of the newer locations in this chain, and the carry on the 60+ years of tradition very well. Sometimes service is hit or miss. But the food is always spot on. Make sure you know what you want, what style mexican food you are expecting before trying something new."}
{"text":"We live close to this location and have eaten here twice now. First I will say they have a great patio. But other than the patio both visits have been horrible experiences. 

The first visit we sat on the patio and ordered \"Fajitas for two.\" When they brought it out we had a total of 2 taco sized tortillas and not enough meat to even fill one.

Our second visit was this weekend. Again we sat on the patio. The help brought out chips and dip right away which was great because we had been working all day and we were hungry and thirsty. Well twenty minutes go by... our chips are gone, are mouths are dry and nobody has come by to even take our drink order. Finally relief we order drinks I ask for lemon... receive drinks. Guess what? No lemon.
No biggie, we order our food. My wife orders enchiladas No onions please, I order a chimichanga.  Wife gets enchiladas with onions (still not a big deal), I get a \"wet soggy\" chimichanga (still no complaint), but thinking to myself WTH I could have gone to Filibertos and at least had a warm crispy chimichanga.
Then finally some good service.... here come refills for our drinks :)  ... except the waiter drops one on me. Then he says he will get me a some towels and I stand there for 5 minutes dripping Pepsi everywhere watching him ring out another table before grabbing my towel. We didn't ask, but we received no manager apology or discount."}
{"text":"Went to Garcia's for the first time to try it out. We went an hour before close, around 8. The host was very nice and accommodating. I wish I could say the same about the server, Alex. She came up, didn't introduce herself asked what we wanted to drink and stormed off. When she returned with our drinks she slammed them on the table and asked what we wanted to eat. We barely got our order out before she was turning to leave, my husband wanted a drink from the bar and we had to stop her from walking away to put his drink order in. When she delivered our food, she once again slammed the plates on the table and walked away without asking us if we needed anything else. As a former server and bartender, I understand what is it like to be busy but I would never treat a customer that way we were treated. It was unfortunate to be treated with such disgust on our first encounter of the restaurant, the ambiance was very appealing and the food wasn't terrible. It's safe to say we won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"used to be the only place I would eat tacos. Just got take out and the tacos are sopping wet and have a previously frozen taste. I would rather pay twice as much for taco bell. I ordered extra bean dip in LIEU of salsa and still got salsa."}
{"text":"I thought about writing a long review about my entire experience, but I'll just sum it up by saying that this restaurant is HORRIBLE. The staff is horrible, the food is horrible, and the wait to get food is also ridiculous. I wanted to try and look beyond the recent bad reviews this restaurant got but was that a huge mistake. I now know why they are rated so bad and why they will continue to be rated so bad. We wanted to order a tamale with our meal and our server grabbed one of the menus and pointed to the delicious, authentic looking tamale pictured on the menu and said \"you see this tamale here? this is not what you're going to get here. This is food photography and is meant to make food look good. The tamales here are not good and I would not recommend them.\" At first I was pretty shocked that she would bad mouth the food there since she worked there, but was appreciative that she was honest if that were true. If it stopped there that would have been great, but then she goes on to say... \"it's like if you guys were craving miso soup..\" We stared at her in disbelief and I could not believe what this ignorant server was saying to me and my family. Then she continues on to say \"wait, you guys are not Japanese I'm sensing... are you?\" and I politely told her no, we're Korean. She then tries to save herself but we're already angry and tuned her out. 45 minutes pass and our food finally comes out. The steak in the ultimate burrito was so chewy like rubber and tasted really odd, the refried beans were watered down and gross, everything we ordered was drenched in cheese and sour cream and that's probably because the meat they use is not good so they try to mask it. Do not come here... there are millions of other Mexican restaurants that serve way better food and have don't employ ignorant people to serve customers."}
{"text":"Tasty Mexican food. I love their enchiladas and tortilla soup. Not to mention the guacamole."}
