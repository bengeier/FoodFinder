It hangs out the bun by a foot. 
Nice, unique little place.
Limited hours."}
{"text":"Terry's Kitchen catered our wedding back in February and they went above and beyond! The food was absolutely delicious and loved by everyone! We couldn't have picked a better caterer. Donna even stayed and helped serve the food! We couldn't be more thankful! We would definitely recommend them to anyone who needs catering for a small party or a huge gathering! Even if you just want a delicious meal, this is the place to go! Truly the best barbecue restaurant in the area!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. Reasonable prices A home cooking kind of feel the patrons are like good ole America. It's a country feel good fast food. You have country music playing in the background. And the waitress very friendly and great on the eyes. I will come here again. 1-19-18 9:30am.  Mr. Wallace, you done good here. Should s proud of yourself"}
{"text":"Old boys hangout.  International Harvester hats, country music and styrofoam cups of coffee.  Great food in a simple setting.  Paper towel on the roll, menus already at the table.  If this were Philly it would be a box car diner that only served breakfast.  It happens to be North Carolina and that means you hear about cows and farms and tractors.  Wonderfully quaint."}
