{"text":"Food ok, so 1 star for food ! But poor service, unfriendly waitress, no sense on their service!"}
{"text":"Food: 5/5
Service: 0.5/5
Environment: 3.5/5

Went here along with friends here for a birthday dinner. The food here is great, however, the service is HORRIBLE. We ordered 6 dishes and 5 minutes after they served the last dish, they asked us if we want to pay the bill in a really non-polite tone. I understand that there is a small line up, but you can't just ask customers to leave so soon. There are even a bunch of empty tables around.

On the other hand, the food was fresh and very delicious. 

Probably will not visit again because of the bad service."}
{"text":"Food is good but the place is super dirty. The sofa and seats are dirty . The menus are oily. Lastly, the floor, especially under the tables are gross. The staff there simply push all the dirt from the table to the floor when they clean up the tables in between customers."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant in Tuesday evening, so was not very busy and got a table right away. 

We ordered fried tentacles, lobster e-fu noodles, fried beef with gailan, and fried spring rolls. The tentacles are huge, however feel a bit greasy! Food quality is good, as well as the quantity.

However, the service can be improved! All we need is a bit smile when handing in dishes.

It is good in general, and in Richmond Hill."}
{"text":"Very decent place to get good Chinese food.  Not the best but definitely good value for your money. Restaurant style is like other congee places (congee wong, congee queen etc.)  What sets this apart from the other places is, the option to order big lobster and crab dishes. 

Food portions are pretty good here.  Taste wise, i find most of the dishes needed a little more salt in it.  

Meal also came with free dessert, but the red bean dessert was just awful.  

Can't really complain about the price, it is on par with the other restaurants.  

Will i come back... hard to say.  Place is not too far away.   But, can't say it will be my first choice."}
{"text":"The restaurant is so tiny too many tables. I ordered congee and stir fry vegetables. Congee is ok but the vegetables is so oily! I couldn't finished. Pricy and services are are not too good (normal for Chinese restaurant). I might not come back unless my husband want congee."}
{"text":"Frequently dine here. Very busy place. Service is quick. Congee on par with other congee places. Dishes slightly better than other Cantonese style restaurants. Prices gone up a bit this year, but generally worth the money."}
{"text":"They expanded their afternoon special menu since I last visited with a new pineapple drink and more $2 and $3 side dish additions. it's nice to see an increased selection of food and the pineapple drink was pretty good. The food here is consistent and decent, but their service sucks to the core. They seem to be understaffed all the time, with their servers running and scrambling everywhere. It's almost impossible to track down a server to get a tea refill or to follow-up on our order - they acknowledge you with a nod while scurrying across the restaurant but then never come back to actually see what you want. They also got our order wrong - we ordered grilled tofu but were served with garlic tofu, told them they got it wrong but we never ended up getting it, even after following up with them multiple times. 

It's really quite a shame because their food is quite good and the location is very convenient to me, but they have got to fix up the horrible service."}
{"text":"Food is good, atmosphere is not. They try to cram as many people into this tiny space as possible, to the detriment of your dining experience."}
{"text":"The food here is very good but the service can be improve. Got seated right away but took forever for one of the servers to take our order.  Portions are large and has good wok hay. The afternoon tea specials are a great value, you get your choice of fried noodles, noodle soup or a rice dish with a drink of your choice and you can add a side dish for an extra $2. Expect good food but don't expect great service at this rest."}
{"text":"We ate here during their Grand Opening and found it chaotic.  Thinking it was just first night jitters and they needed to find their groove, we brushed off the bad service.  Unfortunately, on our second visit, nothing has changed.  

You walk into the restaurant and it takes them awhile to even acknowledge your existence.  When they finally sit you, they seem to forget about you again.  No menus or drinks are offered and all of the servers seem to purposely avoid eye contact when you try to call them.

It is not worth the hassle to come back.  To top it off, their Fried Squid with spicy salt and Tofu was horrible.  It seemed regular salt was used and way too much of it."}
{"text":"Every dinner with friends or family like to go to \"Mr Congee\" fresh food, good service, every time go to their home business is very good very busy, really like their home dishes"}
{"text":"This place is bit pricy compared to other similar restaurants like congee queen...... but it always fully packed. I guess this a good place for the people live   In the north. But for me I would rather drives 10 minutes more to the congee queen on Hwy 7. Two meat combo with rice cost almost 14 dollars after tax!!! What! And it doesn't come with soup..... errrrrrrr, hello??? The other places usually cost 7 or 8 at most.

The food taste ok but still can't figure out why it charges more than the other same restaurants....."}
{"text":"Been there many times because of the availability of decent Chinese restaurant near upper Richmond Hill.

food that are good: BBQ pork, BBQ duck.
food that are average: stirred fried noodles like beef in soya sauce ho-fun. and fried rice
Service: ummmm... hit and miss! servers are too busy running around. you have to find your own napkin and such. Weekends are worse. 

we have considered doing a banquet type dinner there, but after seeing how chaotic the place is during the weekend, I chose somewhere else. 

Tip: 
clientele issue: they have many construction teams around. While they are casually talking, they swear in Chinese, and it can get a bit gross."}
{"text":"This review based on dinner, for lunch I would only give 2.5 stars. 

We went there with a group of 10 around 7:30-8pm. This place is still fully packed with ppl. We waited about 15-20mins to get seated. We ordered a set dinner and most of the dish portion were huge and the price was right. The food tasted fresh and hot, way better if I compared the lunch we went there during their grant opening months before. We need 3 full boxes to pack the leftovers home."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a Chinese restaurant with good service then this is definitely NOT the place to go. The absolute worst service imaginable. Waitress took down the wrong order, wrong dishes were brought to the table, and we waited 1 hour for our final dish that didn't even come. 
The staff was very unhelpful. 
I would avoid this place at all costs. There are far better Chinese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Left without ordering. Went to wash my hands. 2 servers came out of stalls and went back to work without washing their hands."}
{"text":"This place is addictive. Every time I come back here I NEED to go to this place before I leave. 

Mr. Congee is basically an imitation of the Congee Queen/King franchises and for all intents and purposes does everything about the same. Except it has shorter lines so +1 to them!

The food is delicious and there is so much variety you can order new things everytime you come here, but you won't because you're always going to want to get the chilli turnips, bbq duck, preserved egg congee, and the fu jian fried rice. There's also usually good deals on seafood and a regular $6 boiled shrimp plate. The meats are never dry, food is never overcooked or overseasoned, and the dishes are consistent each time. The worst thing I've ever had here was a crab deal that was still ice cold from the freezer, but it was honestly still okay. I've had worse at places I've paid more. All the prices are very reasonable and I believe their menu is online? If its not, you can refer to the congee queen menu which is definitely online. It's very similar.

Service here is definitely spotty. Standard asian resto service: fast, no chitchat, all business. Sometimes they do forget water/tea, and come off a little cold, but it's never been that bad. *I have only come here with family so our table has always ordered in mandarin and we are all Chinese people. Different linguistic/racial mixes may produce different results here. (It may help to know some of what you want beforehand and be very clear about it.)

Weekends can sometimes produce a line, 5-10 min wait. Make a reservation if you want."}
{"text":"I didn't know there is such a good restaurant just 5 minutes drive from home. So yummy! My picky kids started to love Chinese food and have a good appetite after having a brunch here. Good job Mr. Congee! My kids said they will never let me spend money on Macdonald's again. LOL."}
{"text":"Glad to have Chinese food options without having to go to Hwy 7! This has become my weekend lunch regular spots. The restaurant is spacious and the decor inside is quite modern as well. Pretty good service, the servers are polite and food is brought over fairly quickly. 

Some of my favourite dishes are the Congee with Salted Pork and Century Egg and fried Taiwanese vermicelli. The side snacks like fried chinese crullers are great options as well. They also have BBQ options available, great for takeouts. 

Prices are very decent, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Its a new place. I only got take out but the dinng room looks nice. A bit dark (needs more lighting) but overall nice. They have the customary hanging meats at the front which is nice since thats what i usually get. 

Got some of the dishes off the menu too which were good. Reasonably priced, certainly not cheap though. Portions on the small side though; i expected more. 

They take credit card, but for take out its only if ur order total $30 BEFORE tax, otherwise they insist you pay cash (which is not cool in my opnion; my order was $28, and $31 after tax, they insisted on cash). 

Its still a decent place though, but not as good as Congee queen, the gold standard in the congee space imho. I will go back for convenience only."}
{"text":"Noisy !
Place is very contemporary style open space which causes Echo and noise 

Servers are fast, very short patience and if you happen to be non Asian or do not speak the language it's even shorter.
 So, the solution they have found is to give the customers two sets of menus - not sure why two and what's the difference- with very good looking pictures 
Now since communication does not seem to be the strong side in order to get your food you will get a small note which you need to write the code from the menu (I.e S1,) 
Now the food, I actually had  large expectations mainly because of the large Asian customer base 
But then as high the expectations are - the fall is as bad 
I ordered a dish with chicken and shrimp over noodles- I guess similar to pad Thai - unlike the Pad Thai - this had no Taste what so ever, I considered returning it but thinking about the language challenge - I just asked for the bill. 
As the place was very loaded - it may be me and what I have ordered 
That is why I have decided to give 2 stars instead of one 
I however will not come back."}
{"text":"A lot of people, the tables are too close to each other, you can literally hear the conversation of the people at the next table. Foods are so-so, nothing exciting, but kind of cheap and not that cheap when comparing similar Chinese Restaurant like Ocean Seafood Restaurant"}
{"text":"We ordered take-out , 5 dishes and we were very, very disappointed with the flavor of the food. I don't know if the quality would be better if we had dined there instead. The tiger shrimp with ginger & green onion E-Fu noodle came  in a watery tasteless sauce and the beef & vegetable fried noodle was just as plain in flavor.  The chicken fried rice again was plain and actually needed more salt and flavor.  The spice & pepper salt squid needed more spice and salt.  The bbq combo was average and was probably the only acceptable dish in all.  We had
originally thought we could go to Mister Congee for a upcoming family gathering of 30 people but after this experience I don't think we should go back for more tasteless food !  One positive note is that the delivery was quick."}
{"text":"Must say nothing they did last night (December 27th) was right.

1). We got to our \"clean\" table and the table was still wet
2). The cup, bowl and plates were still dirty 
3). We ordered 2 bowls of noodles and it took 25 mins to arrive.  Had to follow up twice 
4). Went to pay with debt at the counter and found out credit, debit can only be used if the bill is $30 or more ( I didn't see any signs by the door)

Worst experience ever. Don't understand why this place is so busy. Never going back again

Oh, left $0 tip. That was my only highlight"}
{"text":"Scary take out experiences with this  impolite staff, used to come here few times a week, been treated impolite by this staff the 3rd time this week, don't think I will back here again"}
{"text":"Service was lousy food was a little salty...waited almost 45 min for our order...not recommended:"}
{"text":"Honest review:

Small portion size. Portion smaller than Congee Queen. Taste is below average. Service is average. We didn't enjoy our meal and we are definitely not coming back. We payed $63.30 for the following.

*Salmon fried rice - very small portion, half size from Congee queen.
*Salt pepper fish fillet- small portion
*Sizzling ribs - not sizzling, no taste, 50% fat and 50% meat
*Beef pho - big let down. Taste like thick noodle poured with hot water. No taste at all.
*Mango slush - average.

Im very disappointed and what a waste of money :-(
I hope the owner reads this."}
{"text":"The food is ok but the restaurant itself is not super clean. But we don't have much chinese restaurants in the neighbourhood so it is still a good choice when my wife is not feeling to cook."}
{"text":"I come here a lot, lunch, take-out, dinner, afternoon specials.. you name is.. so it's actually hard for me to write about everything that i have tried..  so a few highlights here:

1. Roast pork - good, skin is crispy
2. You can customize your order.  For example i always ask for NO MSG.  They will let you know if certain dishes cannot be done.  Dishes without msg will be a little less tasty, but better for health =)
3. mushroom with snow peas always good
4. *NEW* afternoon meal special.  The original after 3pm special is when you order food from the selected menu (which has A LOT of choices), it comes with free drink including the iced red bean drink with ice-cream.  NOW, if you add another $2 you can choose 1 of 6 other snacks!  Great value! i love the cucumber salad, it goes very well with the rest of the meal.
5. meal selection is similar to other congee chains"}
{"text":"Second time ordering take out from here and both times experience has been average. The cashier needs to learn about customer service and how to greet customers. Food was ready when i got there but tastes average at best. Portion sizes are good but not worth the price."}
{"text":"This restaurant is newly open.  I heard the first day when it is open, it is free !

Now it's the third week.  It is packed at dinner time.  We waited for a while and decided to get the table at the patio.  It is uncommon for a Chinese restaurant to have a patio but it exists from the many previous owner.  There are not many waitresses coming out to the patio which is understandable as inside the restaurant it is packed.  So we gather our thoughts and put in the order at the waitress first appearance.  We are at the same time served with cutlery, tea and paper napkins.  

When the food arrives, all dishes arrived at the same time.  It is served as if it is an Italian or French restaurant.  Everything is hot and sizzling.  The fish head hot pot is delicious with lot of fish meat.  The fish pieces are lightly battered.  The Congee is well boiled.  The fried vermicelli is a bit on the salty side.  The steamed vermicelli rolls served with peanut and seafood sauces.  Boiled vegetable is average.  The Chinese donut can be better.  The pot of steamed rice with chicken and mushroom smells good.  It is really cooked on the stove.  A lot of these pot of steamed rice these days are fake to have the cooked rice poured into the hot pot rather than the raw rice cooked in the pot

When the bill comes, it surprise me of only $10 per person with 10% off for open special.  Overall it is another choice for congee."}
{"text":"We went on Monday for Mid-Autumn festival dinner, it was packed, some of us needed to park our cars across the street (What a bagel's plaza), service was slow.  They are under-staffed.   
We ordered the set dinner for 10, the BBQ meats were DRY; the chicken was dry; the BBQ pork was dry and tough, jellyfish tasted weird.  Nothing special about their food.  
Service was horrible, empty plates were left on the table even when the waiters brought  other dishes out, they just didn't bother to clean them.  We piled them up then my sister couldn't stand it and brought them to their station at the back of the restaurant near the entrance of patio.  
The reason why they are busy because there is nothing similar in that area."}
{"text":"This place is definitely a gem along the Yonge St. strip in Richmond Hill that recently opened.  The menu serves extensive dishes typical to a congee house (wide array of dishes outside of just congee so do not be put off by the name of the restaurant), so there is something yummy for everyone.  The place itself has a large interior and well spaced tables and booths for people to be seated comfortably, not much in terms of decor but again, congee places usually do not pride themselves on expensive decor either.  Service is average at best, but usually congee places are speedy and efficient with bringing food which is what people like about them. If you are looking for top notch customer service, do not expect it here, especially with very reasonably priced (read: cheap) menu items that are well-portioned.

My favourites include:

1. Bbq pork drizzled in honey (you can get the combo dish with rice and veggies for around $6) and the portion is massive

2. Congee with preserved egg and shredded pork

3. Spicy fried turnip cakes 

4. Sizzling salmon fish head served in hot pot

The food is fresh and looks clean, the taste is much better than other congee houses in the area.  They also have special during afternoon tea time (ends at 5pm), and if you are going for dinner, they serve free dessert afterwards to each person.  The desserts range (depending on what day of the week you go) from sweet red bean soup, hot mango sago soup, and the small sticky rice balls cooked in hot rice wine and sugar water. Usually the desserts are served hot, which is perfect for this time of the year when the weather is getting chilly."}
{"text":"The food here is so good compare to other Chinese restaurant.  This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurant. The food come up very fast and delicious. Just the environment is not that good. Too crowded and a little bit over priced for the environment but worth for food. Other than that. I will recommend this place."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Came around 4pm on mothers day with my bf, aunt and grandmother and got seated right away at a big round table to the right side after entering the door. I feel like that area is not a good spot for a table, you are sitting behind a wall filled with chairs and high chairs as if they stuck a table in the waiting space just to make more money. It was hard to get anyones attention. First thing we noticed was how dirty the table was and service took awhile to come clean and give us menus. Finally a waitress came and cleaned our table with a dry white cloth and poured tea on it to moisten it and handed us plates, cups, etc as well as a few menus. The plates and stuff came out not looking so clean so i took on the job cleaning everyones by using the napkin dipped in hot tea. Im used to doing it at chinese restaurants because most of the time they rush the cleaning process and it doesnt come out as clean. 
My aunt ordered everything since she's been here before. We got the lunch special which included a free drink such as bbtea, lemon tea and red bean ice cream with shaved ice. She also ordered a small side for an extra $2 each for fried wonton and chicken wings. 
First item that came out was the shrimp congee which was decent but had huge pieces of shrimp which was shocking for the price, there were at least 7 or 8 pieces of large shrimps. Second item was the turnip cake and sides. I really enjoyed rhe turnip cake it was my favourite dish, it had chicken, dried shrimp and shrimp in it and some sort of crunchy pickled vegetable. The dish had a nice flavour that you get only at restaurants or homes that have a gas stove and a really hot wok. The snack dishes were decent and the shrimp wontons were full of shrimps. The last dish wr got was Singapore vermicelli noodles. It was tasty but had too much onions in it. My boyfriend picked out all the onions it was too much for him. Everything from our meal came up to just a bit over $30 which is a great price to feed 4 hungry people, at least to satisfy my boyfriend since he can be a big eater.

Would I come here again? Yes if I was in the area and felt like a cheap meal. I would probably order the turnip cake again as well as some different dishes. The place lost some stars from cleanliness of the place as well as service and placement of our table. I would rather go to Congee Queen which I find a bit cleaner and better service."}
{"text":"SMELL
When I first walked into the restaurant I find there's a distinct seafood smell. Not too pleasant. It's kinda chilly too during fall and winter when we dine in. 

FOOD
The food isn't too bad. I do prefer Congee Queen better. The price is okay but I find its higher than Congee Queen for the same kind of dish. If you're eating here close to special occasions like Christmas, be sure to book in advance! It's bloody when everyone is hungry and wants to fight for a table! 

PARKING
Parking is a nightmare during lunch and dinner hours. There's not too many spots for a big restaurant like this one! We had to park far far away into the residential area."}
{"text":"I've been here several times with my family as its one of the closest chinese restaurants to home. The parking lot always seems packed even when there arent many customers inside.

The service here is mediocre, I guess it depends on who the server is for the table. My brother personally dislikes this place due to service he recieved one time.

The food here is just like many typical chinese restaurants, nothing exceptionally good or bad. I do however prefer their fried turnip dish but then again that dish seems to be fried differently each time we order it at any restaurant; sometimes its so under fried we would have to tell them to redo it. 

Overall the food here isn't too bad. I would return as it is close to my home and my parents do enjoy it."}
{"text":"I really love the food here but I wasn't happy with the plates, chopsticks and tea cups--they were dirty. We had ask them to change it. Also, the problem is the service but it is already expected in most chinese restuarant that customer service will not be as good as you expect. My favorite dish here was the shrimp chicken mango but the chicken was a bit chewy. But overall it was an okay experience. The washrooms were dirty though. It's always busy here and they have a weak exhaust. Our clothes smelled like food when we left the restuarant."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 12 people at 730. Got seated at 8. We were then seated at a table for 8 people.
The service was horrible and the staff was not willing to compromise

Did not have a chance to order 

Will not visit again."}
{"text":"Was looking for a late bite on a wed evening, at around 9 and was surprised to find this place still opening with lots of people going still! Was seated quickly, the waitress was friendly, spoke Cantonese. Our waitor who took our order only spoke Mandarin tho but we managed. We ordered a stir fry style lobster, around 2 lbs they have a special for 15.99/llb. As well as a tofu brocolli dish. 
The lobster came first, it looked a lot smaller than when it was alive (but I guess it always looks smaller once cooked and chopped up).  The seasoning was good as expected. 
For he tofu brocolli dish, the tofu was actually a bit sour. We decided to tell the waitress. She was very accommodating and took it back to the kitchen to prepare a new one for us."}
{"text":"Hands down, I'd pick Mr. Congee over Congee Wong, any day. 

Coming from Mississauga, it makes me happy I don't gotta venture any further east for good Chinese. 

These guys actually put effort, into the presentation of their food. The dishes aren't overly greasy, like your typical Chinese joints. Unlike Congee Wong, I don't need to be picking though the entire plate, looking for shrimps or whatever meat. 

In all my visits, they're always busy. Service can be a real pain, depending where you're seated (steer away from the back left corner of the resto). Definitely call ahead if you're coming as a group!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious! Service is much better then most Chinese Restaurant in Toronto! 
Today, will be back for dinner, to celebrate the Mother's Day!!
Yeah.... can't wait to see all of you!!"}
{"text":"Feel like congee so we decided to come to this place. Ordered a house congee which is like a seafood congee, and ordered a fried rice with shrimps, BBQ pork, and preserved pork. I found the congee isn't that good as in there isn't much taste. However, the fried rice is very good and big portion. So if you are here for their dishes then this place is good. But for congee then maybe something simple would be a better choice. But I remembered I had a good pork bone congee from here so that probably mean only their seafood congee isn't their best. Also, if you have a larger group that's more than 4, you may want to make reservations for it because I waited for more than 30 mins just for 2 and there are many ppls waiting as well on a Saturday night at 6:30pm."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch and dinner and it is usually packed for both services. My mother suggest this place to me since the dishes were fairly priced. I would really like to complement the chef, since each and every time I have been to this restaurant they have made each dish spot on. Everything taste great, however the same cannot be said at their Richmond hill location, hence why I would like to complement the chef. There are a lot of congee queen, King, star but this restaurant is the best in the GTA. So why not five give this place five stars? Well since it's a congee misc restaurant they don't specialize in anything. Like the saying goes Jack of all trades and master of none."}
{"text":"This is my go to to get my congee/noodles fix.  It is located right beside London Pub and as it has gained more and more popularity over the past few months, this place can run out of parking from time to time - you can park at the neighbouring London Pub when that happens   Also, this place is not only popular amongst Asians, but also frequented by many other races.  I'm happy to see that and the waiters can also translate/explain a lot of the menu items if you have questions.

Now about the food:
Congee: the few times that I had the congee here, I thought it was okay... I prefer the congee at congee queen.   Quality is a bit inconsistent and can be a bit watery or flavourless.  I normally don't order the congee here.

Noodles:  can't go wrong - I've been pretty happy with the fried noodles/noodles in soup every time I get it!

My favourite is to come here for their afternoon tea specials.  I usually get the singapore turnip cake (there're bits of shrimp, chicken, and egg with this) and add the spring rolls and cucumber, crab, roe salad for like $2-3/plate more.  You also get bubble tea included with the price of the afternoon tea.  It's a great deal!"}
{"text":"Always the go-to place in my neighborhood for BBQ takeouts and everyday Chinese dishes. They are usually packed on weekends and nights, especially holidays too. Service is usually fast and efficient. Even when I went for Christmas dinner, the lineups went by pretty quick.

They have many variety of dishes but what I love most are their fried carrot cakes and deep fried calamari (asian style). I think anything you choose will be of good quality. Their morning congee and noodles are delicious too.

The restaurant is toward the loud side, as is any Chinese dining place right? :) But the food is always fresh and steamy - as Cantonese people always say \"yao wok hay\"."}
{"text":"A full house on a Friday night at dinner time, a sure sign of its popularity! The open-concept seating keeps everything casual, and all kinds of patrons are found - families, friends, couples, etc. a short wait and we're seated, since the quick pace of food arriving keeps patrons moving out the door. Many came in for takeout, and I noticed a roast meat rack in the back - in-house roasting??

As with many Chinese restaurants - don't expect a lot of service because that just isn't the culture/style - here you'll see a few waitresses covering the entire store and doing a lot of running around, so take pity on the short staff and be patient! You'll also have to speak up if you want to get their attention - hand raising and attempts to make eye contact are encouraged. 

I've been here in the past so I noticed they've recently(?) put in a newly printed menu - increased prices since my last visit, but still affordable and reasonable. The menu is bilingual - English and Chinese, with lots and lots of photos. Ordering is also language-friendly - a small piece of paper is provided along your menus with your table number, under which you jot down your item codes. Be sure to read carefully to see if there's customizations to specify for your items to ensure speedy ordering.

We got a bowl of congee, a fried rice, roast chicken, and greens. The congee is one-size, and somewhere between the small and large found at other similar casual Hong Kong style diners such as Congee Wong, Congee Queen, and Phoenix. The other dishes were average in size, so quite enough for a table of three.

The fried rice I got was the house special eel fried rice - it had fix-ins similar to a traditional Japanese eel rice, with the sauce, and added in onions (weird combination), fish roe (good add), and fish shavings (I don't know what they're called...those paper-thin shavings that move in the heat waves - they were an interesting bonus topping). 

The fried chicken was a surprise - more moist than I've had at other places, more flavourful, and the shrimp chips were fresh and crunchy. Again comparing to similar HK-style diners in Markham/Richmond Hill, did not disappoint!

Dessert on the house at dinner is always an added bonus - papaya sago was served hot and on the sweet side, but very rich and creamy with a good amount of coconut flavour."}
{"text":"They have recently changed their menu. I suspect an ownership change. 
Service is definitely slipping. 

I ordered the wonton Lo Mein from their afternoon tea menu. I added some beef tendon (ngao gun) to the order for an extra charge. I was disappointed that my addition of the tendon made me ineligible for the $2 Garlic Tofu afternoon special. I don't understand why. 
Also, all the patrons around me have a pot of tea on their table. Where is mine? Is this because I ordered in English?  

The beef tendon was ex excellent. Very soft. Great flavour and mouth-feel. Better than usual here. 

The wonton are good. About ping-pong sized. Filled with shrimp. A few too many shells though. 

The XO fried rice noodles was pretty good. Good 'Wok Hei' but sadly missing the XO. And undersalted, leaving it a bit bland. 

I would return, as they have a huge menu and close to work. Though, I would prefer a Congee Wong or Queen if there were one closer"}
{"text":"Really good HK style food. It gets busy often but the food comes out fast. 

They only accept cash under 20."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and service has always been pretty much on par with most Asian places: fast and no nonsense.  

We waited a little longer tonight.  They had to fulfill all those Christmas dinner orders.  People lined up carrying large boxes of bags and bags of take out.  

Our go-to dishes:  beef fried rice noodles with bean sprouts and Cantonese fried noodles.  No complaints.  Good portions and well-made.  

We had a slight issue with payment.  I do think it was our own fault with a certain level of miscommunication. 

We were offered dessert!  Whaaaaat???  Two people and we get dessert?  Nice.  I politely declined though.  It was some sort of peanut and squash business."}
{"text":"Always wanted to visit this place as I saw the ad in Chinese newspaper that they have Lobster for $9.99.

Finally visited on a Sunday night, man, this place is BUSY!
it's packed at 6:30 pm, but they split up the last square table for the 2 of us. yay!

Lobster is on special for $13.99 with a minimum order of $20. and we see the table next to us has the Stir-fry Clams in black bean chili sauce, so we ordered that too.
we also ordered a chicken dish.

first came the chicken dish, it's served on a cast iron plate, it's sizzling hot, it makes a regular dish to become a great dish.
then comes the stir-fry clams. clams sizes are okay, and there alot of it.

Finally the Lobster. for $13.99 it's in a really big portion and it's tasty!!
the flavors are great, and the small fried fish on the top of it are crispy.

there are so much food that we have to pack the chicken and lobster home.
even just 2 people, they still give us dessert for free.
and the total just comes to $45 with a beer added to it too.
it's cheap, and with their menu being really stylish, PLUS they accept credit card, I'm sure I'll be back often for the lobster."}
{"text":"Good fast Chinese food north of Hwy 7! 

Ordered take out here for my friend who has a young baby! Had lobster with e-fu noodles, lobster was too breaded I thought, noodles were good. House seafood & mixed vegetables fried Taiwanese vermicelli and fried rice noodle w shrimp and scrambled egg sauce were pretty good. The house fried rice with eel, fish roe and crab meat was a bit disappointing. It had an okonomiyaki feel with some sweet sauce and fish shavings. However, there were some unidentifiable fried bits of meat in there whether eel or crab as well as imitation crab meat and not the real kind. Overall food was good and similar to Congee Queen!"}
{"text":"Taste is decent, gives a nice atmosphere. Located inside Bridlewood Mall, easy to find since its a store front. Parking is easy. Only downside is that it is better to get a reservation on busy days such as the weekends. Other wise, the menu is fairly sized with a variety of different asian dishes."}
{"text":"This place started slow for me.  It's in my neighborhood, so I really wanted them to succeed, but the first few times going I thought it was just ok...nothing that special...just another Congee place.   However in the last while, I noted a marked improvement.   No reason to go further to places like Congee Queen, Wong, etc.  I think this one is just as good if not better!  Note:  It is a relatively \"smaller\" place than the others."}
{"text":"Very impressed by this place, right in my parent's neighborhood. Food is pretty great- a bit on the salty side but the 2nd time we went, we just asked them to cut down on the salt, and they did.

Congee was tasty, and we got free steamed shrimp for spending greater than $38.

There are a few tables that are out of the way, which makes you have to chase down servers... Lose a star for that. Otherwise, Highly Recommend!!"}
{"text":"The only appeal of this restaurant is that it serves decent quality food for inexpensive prices. The experience, however, is cringe-worthy. Lineups during peak hours are insane and the store layout clearly was not made to accommodate the back-to-back sardine packing action at the doorway. 
When I went for dinner, it was noisy, I felt rushed, and the employees were very lackluster. The tables were dirty and sticky and I already felt all the regrets upon taking off my jacket. 

Granted, the food here was fine. The rice stone pot had a smaller portion of rice but the chicken was very tender and juicy. The BBQ pork was palatable and tender as well. The vegetable dish was plentiful and the gai lan had a nice soft crunch to it. My only complaint would be that this dish was overly drenched in oil. It nearly blinded me from how brightly it glistened. 

Another downfall was the dessert soup, which would have been a waste of my intake quota. It was supposedly red bean soup but it had been diluted to the max and tasted more like water. There were barely any red beans present and the texture was runny.

Overall, I would probably come back for the food:cost value, but just never again during busy hours. I'd likely just stick with afternoon tea to get the complementary specialty drink (see previous review)."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Monday afternoon. Not too busy, not too loud, not too long of a wait for food! Overall, this place was pretty standard, in a good way.

Food was acceptable and prices were average. I would recommend the stir fry seafood vermicelli, which was pretty flavorful, and the overall selection of BBQ meats, which were nice tender cuts. Nothing was exceptionally delicious but I definitely wouldn't mind coming here again.

(If you've been to Congee Queen, this place is very similar to that)"}
{"text":"I am so pleased there is finally a Chinese restaurant closer than Bayview/Major Mack to me.  Although this place has been open a while, i've only checked it out recently.

The service here is average. The two times I've been here, tables weren't cleaned before I sat down, even though they told me to sit there? thanks.

Waitresses seem to have little patience and don't really return to your table once they give you your initial order of food. Also, you get a tiny piece of paper to write your order on, and then they just take it- no confirmation/ no words exchanged.. not really a fan of that.

Place is pretty big, decent decor, lots of space, ample parking. 

Will go back because its hella close and I need to eat as much chow mein as possible until I move to Buffalo where my favourite dishes don't exist across the border."}
{"text":"i like most of the dishes we ordered, the food exceeded my expectation."}
{"text":"The Halibut with Teriyaki Sauce caught the attention of my uncle and it was actually a really good dish!  For only $8.99, we got five big pieces of fried halibut that were covered in Teriyaki sauce.  We really liked how well the halibut was deep fried -- it was crunchy and crispy!  The fish meat underneath the crunchy skin was also very tender and smooth."}
{"text":"The other reviewer was spot on about favortism at Mr Congee (Bridelwood Mall location).  I walked in before the dinner rush and asked for a table for two. They sat me at cramped space with a dirty table and didnt give me a menu. Two other people came in and they promptly served them tea and gave them menus. I was annoyed and wanted to leave but I was meeting someone here so I didn't want to bail.

Ordered roasted duck on rice and brisket lo mein. They were ok. A third of the duck portion was literal skin and bone. Quality and taste and portions are better at Congee Queen. 

Their takeout bags are crap. Logo rubs off easily

There are better options than this place. Would not come back"}
{"text":"This place may have food that is at or slightly above average, but like many others have commented, the service is absolutely terrible. 

They seem to seat their preferred walk-in customers first, regardless of the length of the walk-in line.  They try to make weak excuses for their action and do not appropriately address the concern. 

Otherwise, like many others have discussed, while food comes quick, service is otherwise terrible if you want something. You have to make your request numerous before actually getting what you want."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre. The cups have a strong dishwashing smell, washrooms are dirty, just unappealing. Service is OK, but this is definitely not a restaurant I would come back to."}
{"text":"It's a decent congee place. Typical Chinese restaurant. 

When we first entered no one really greeted us but it was super packed in there for a Saturday Lunch. We got a table fairly quickly but we noticed that the heat was off and it was chilly outside. Everyone in the restaurant was wearing their winter jacket and toques while eating! But the heat turned on halfway through our meal so I guess they just haven't adjusted to the sudden change in temperature outside??

Food was decent nothing spectacular and nothing horrible. We ordered a bowl of congee with shrimp and scallop, with like may 4 pieces of shrimp and 6 pieces of scallop was hoping for more... We also got a fried noodle soy sauce with beef which is decent but that is pretty hard dish to mess up. We also decided to get the House Special Fried Chicken. The Fried chicken was the last to come out, I asked the waitress about it and she told me that generally takes longer because the chicken is fried fresh which is a good thing to know! They did bring it out once we were half way done eating the other dishes. They forgot to bring us the salt for the chicken tho -.- so I had to ask for it but they were quick to bring it. 

The total of the bill was $30 for all 3 dishes including tax which isn't bad at all. There are probably cheaper options out there but if you have no other option and want to play it safe with Chinese food this place isn't a bad choice."}
{"text":"Had birthday dinner here with a fairly large group. Decor was nice... kinda of generic modern hotel kinda decor. We had between 10-15 dishes ranging from  roast duck to dual lobsters accompanied by some rice and noodles.  The pineapple friend rice was bland... no well seasoned.  The seafood chow mien was limp... the noodle should have that characteristic crunch in the outer layers and softer in the middle.  On the plus side the stir fried lobster was good and I enjoyed the salt-pepper squid. 

I'd go again if I were invited but I wouldn't choose it on purpose... not because it was bad but nothing really to draw me back... It's was OK and good value. It does have a monopoly in the area.  But if you are willing to drive a little to hwy 7 and Leslie area... there are lots of restaurant with the same level of food and value."}
{"text":"When I went to this establishment a few years ago, I was not impressed with the type of food and service I received . Now in present day 2014, things have changed. I have noticed a lot of people have been coming to this restaurant in the past year, even my parents have even taken notice and dragged me along to enjoy a nice lunch with them. I am glad they did.  The food was absolutely amazing. They do the classic Chinese dishes with perfection, just elevating simple everyday ingredients into something special. I would recommend tasting the Stir Fried Turnip Patties, Congee, Barbecued Meats, and their Stir Fried Lobster. Especially for dinner, try to come early since this is a popular spot during the dinner hours. The ambiance is nice but the cleanliness of the tables can be improved on a little bit."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for its Bubble Tea because it just.. blew. me. away. 
I came here not expecting much, simply to fill our stomachs with afternoon tea for brunch with a friend. Like most HK style, afternoon tea comes with a drink, but this place offers Bubble Tea along with the usual drinks.. AT NO EXTRA CHARGE!

When I first received my Bubble Tea, I thought that it needed more ice because I could hardly see any underneath the foam. But then I realized the foaming was unique - it was definitely made using a shaker. Next, they actually use HK-style milk tea for this drink. Not the watered-down, nothing-but-sweet milk tea one would expect from a non-bbt specialty place. They actually used tea-flavoured milk tea. Their tapiocas were chewy and sweet, I enjoyed every one of them. Their tea was smooth and milky, sweetness balance was just right. Not to mention they used a larger cup than most places I've been to. It seemed like a never ending cup and I was so satisfied with what I received. I don't know why, this cup of Bubble Tea just stuck with me, it has made so much of an impression that I have to sit here and write about it today. With my experience in HK-style milk tea, I know a good cup of tea when I taste one. This wasn't even what I came here for but now that I know, I would definitely go back just for their Bubble Tea if I happen to be passing by! I hope that cup I got was not just a fluke, I really look forward to going back for more.

Aside from the drink (yes that deserved a whole paragraph), their food deserves a mention too as it was exceptionally well made. We ordered the typical Chinese food - BBQ pork noodles, Tendon and Ligament noodles, and Tomato Egg Rice. The meats were very well-marinated and tender. An easy taste of approval once you put it in your mouth. Huge portions for their afternoon tea. Very satisfied experience overall."}
{"text":"Food is good and on a par with other congee places. Ordered preserved eggs and pork with congee and ginger beef noodles: both were fairly tasty.

Place is very busy with a lot of customers. I believe it's a good sign but the restaurant itself does not seem that clean and servers are rude for the most part. At least they have pagers on each table if you need anything

Not worth coming here specially in my opinion."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times and after experimenting I just keep adding dishes to the rotation! 

The diced beef in the crispy wonton bowl thing is fantastic, very nicely cooked on the rare side. It's also sweet. The general tao is good here (I have to try it at every restaurant). House fried rice has bits of eel, Japanese fish/squid flakes and I think a bit of teriyaki on top. Hot n sour soup is good too! The large is LARGE. The honey bbq pork is exactly what you think it is. 

Pad Thai isn't anything extraordinary, Just ok. But I would probably go to a Thai place for that dish. Hot pot fish head pieces is ok, but boney so watch out!

Service is whatever.. Sometimes attentive sometimes not. Sometimes they speak English, sometimes they don't."}
{"text":"Go here pretty often because of convenience. Service here is very quick, even rude at times, but if thats what is required for fulfilling my stomach when I'm feeling famished, then I prefer it this way. Bring the dishes out as they are ready. Also the red bean tapioca dessert at the end makes up for it. 

Favourite dishes here are the lobster with onion, rice noodles with satay beef, rice noodles with scrambled egg sauce and shrimp, fried rice with fish, fried banana tempera with honey, black bean beef, and the numerous rice rolls and congees.

Never really had a bad meal here so giving it 4 stars."}
{"text":"If you do not speak Chinese, this is NOT the place for you

The service is the worst we have experienced.

We went through the whole meal with no water on the table - we tried to ask for about 10 times but the message just didn't get through.



The food was just OK, perhaps if they gave us what we wanted to order, I would be able to cretic on what we have ordered.

We waited for 10 min for the bill after asking for 3 times. At the end, I had to go to the cashier and pay directly"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best places to eat ..My husband and his mom eat here all the time as she lives across the road and its become their fav place.. We live in Brampton so its a treat ..i always had a left over container from them but I got to go last night and there were 8 of us and we ordered alot.. We all left with enough to have the next day as the dishes are over flowing.. We have had several dishes there but here are a few of the best H5 ,or the turnip that they do is fantastic for 5.50 Even my husband loves it and he hates turnips ?? sooo...
It compares to a resturant the I went to frequntly in New york City called XO..in China Town there..
Check this place out!!! fantastic food, , but when its busy and it is   you may have to wait a little.. Its the one time you wont be disappointed that you did..."}
{"text":"The service is efficient but a bit rushed.  However, the food is worth it. The menu is vast with a lot of choices that you don't see regularly around town. This is topped with generous portions - an overall good quality at an excellent value."}
{"text":"The food's more or less a three. The rest of it, however, leaves much to be desired.

Even on weeknights, this place is busy. It's also noisy. There aren't enough wait staff. It took about five minutes after we had been seated for them to bring us tea and menus. The tables are awkwardly placed. There are tables that are almost perpendicular to each other, and we're talking about square tables, so for klutzy people like me, walking around in a cramped Chinese restaurant with tables that are perpendicular to one another means I'm going to jam my hip into a table corner somewhere while trying to get by. That's not fun. The tables aren't necessarily clean. I found a green onion on my table after they had placed the table settings and the utensils down. Yeah. That's all before my meal started.

Had:
Ginger and green onion salmon heads in hot pot - probably more an accurate description of the dish, and not necessarily it's accurate name on the menu. I believe it was $7.99. Decent sized portion. I'm not a fan of ginger and green onion. I'm also not a fan of salmon heads unless they're pan fried or grilled. That being said, it was served piping hot and the salmon was moist.
Tung choi with shrimp paste - Not the cheapest, but also a decent sized portion. Good color. Good texture. Not a fan of the bits of filler green and red bell peppers they slipped in there though.
Free range chicken - I've never seen free range chicken this shade of yellow before. It was so vivid it was almost orange. That's bad. It's also artificial. The coloring seeped into some of the flesh, so I know it was added to the chicken. Not cool. That being said, the chicken was juicy and flavorful.
Sweet and sour pork - Crispy. Decent portion. Served in a pineapple. Real pineapple bits, not canned. Some of the pieces were a tad big though (as in more than one mouthful).
Halibut with tayaki sauce (I believe that's how they spelled it on the menu. On their website, I believe it was spelled terriyaki sauce). The plate and the portion size were way off. The plate was really big. There were only four thin steaks on it. To my knowledge, halibut is a pretty big fish. If this was really halibut, these steaks either came from a really small fish, or from the tail end of the fish. The steaks were battered and fried, then served with a slightly sweet sauce. These were lovely. I really do wish the portion was bigger though.
Chili turnip patties - I'm a tad disappointed. Definitely not as big of a portion as Congee Queen. Definitely not as crispy on the edges. The inside is also a tad mushy. Also a tad lacking in the chili department.
All in all, the food was decent, but I've had better.

I was going to give this review a three, because I wasn't sure it deserved a two, but on my way out the door, I got splashed by fish tank water because one of the Mr. Congee staff decided to plunk down two wet buckets. Why did he do this so close to me? Because their fish tanks are between the first and second set of entrance doors to the restaurant. If their staff are trying to get fish from the tanks, it's a tad hazardous to enter or exit the restaurant. I was actually inside the restaurant (inside both sets of entrance doors), but I still got hit. That was totally not cool.

I definitely won't be making any effort to come here again."}
{"text":"I've been to a few different Congee restaurants but Mr. Congee in Richmond Hill is by far the best!

A few of my favorites;

- Peking Duck with Pancake
- Duck Soup (fantastic)
- Deep friend battered Squid with XO
- Eel Seafood Rice

We visited around 1:30pm for a late lunch and it wasn't busy."}
{"text":"Mr. Congee is a mix of HK Café and Cantonese restaurant, they even have peking duck. Somewhat of new'ish Chinese restaurant in the area where it is mostly older restaurants, so the décor is modern and bright. Good place to eat with family. 

Prices are fair and they have a large selection. 

I tried spare ribs, duck wrap, duck lettuce wrap and free range chicken.

All were quite good, one thing I'd say for the duck lettuce wrap was that the duck was actually tender and good sized chunks which is good. Typically I see the pieces are either dryed out, fried and small. 

Lots of parking available."}
{"text":"More than just Congee but if you need a shrimp congee fix then this place is a good start

Sunday night and it's jammed with many of the large family tables taken up

This is a great spot to order a pile of dishes and spin the lazy susan

I would say it does cater to the local asian community with specific dishes that they would come to expect

Honestly I am the only white family here tonight which can mean many things but to me it just means that the food must be good if that's the case

Tonight we just order off the chef specials and have the usual generic beef n broccoli, general tao chicken,  lo mein shrimps but we had to have congee. 

Foods good with ample portions and a pretty broad menu to choose from so all palates will be happy

It can get noisy so maybe not a good spot for a date where serious conversation is required

Take out counter is at the back and the do have a separate accessibility washroom as well"}
{"text":"Mister congee is your really typical chinese restaurant  but I felt the experience was subpar compared to the more and ever popular and standardized Congee Queen.

This place is really small, and it was absolutely packed. There wasn't any room to even walk around and even the waitresses struggled to shuffle around. We came here with two large groups and were able to try numerous dishes on the night.

We had two types of congee (pork liver and preserved egg and shredded pork) here and I felt both were much more salty than average. In addition the fish maw soup was really salty. Both the dishes were all served piping hot at least.  

The Peking duck was pretty decent here although I'm not sure if we ordered one or they gave us half because there wasn't much to it even though it was a two course duck. The stirfried duck with lettuce was pretty good here. I also really recommend their house special fried rice here with unagi, roe, and crab. The rice was light and fluffy and there's a good amount of toppings here. The salted steamed chicken was also pretty good here and wasn't as salty as I expected.

Other dishes were just average/hit and misses including their sizzling plate sirloin, tendons, greens, and Shanghai noodles. They're certainly not bad."}
{"text":"I usually come here for their afternoon special. All meals come with a cold drink in which you can order cold lemon tea, bubble tea, and ice cream with red bean ice (basically drinks that you need to pay extra for in other resturants). Their portions are good and price is moderate. Their food is quite yummy. In terms of cleaniness, its not that clean. I recommend their bbq duck, it is quite tasty and flavourful. You can add $2.00 with every dish you order for their special snacks. I usually get their fried chicken wing, cuz it's big and yummy. Service is fast."}
{"text":"Tasted just like congee queen. It was packed on a Saturday dinner time when we were there. Try to call and reserve seats if you come as a big group (more than 4 people). So it tasted authentic and will come back if in the area next time"}
{"text":"The service is terrible. The food is greasy and it does not have any flavor. The chicken was undercooked and smelly."}
{"text":"Great for your typical Cantonese style dishes - fried noodle, bbq items, congee, etc. Not spectacular but it does the job and it's a regular 'go-to' for us because we are in the area. This place is so busy most evenings and if you're calling for pick up, you may find the lady rude but she really isn't, she's just very busy and getting things done (lol). Most chinese restaurants won't get stellar customer service reviews so you should know that going in. Apart from that, it's pretty good and fast!"}
{"text":"My aunt had heard that it was good here and wanted to give this place a try. We came here on Father's Day and it was packed. All tables were filled and there was a line up at the door. So it probably is really good right? 

The food
Salted pig bone with dried vegetable congee: the congee was okay. nothing special. The salted pork though was actually very tasty. It wasn't too salty. However, I wouldnt order the congee again just for the pork. 

peking duck roast duck two course meal: When I first saw this on the menu for $36.99, I thought that it was actually cheap as most places have it for about $40-$45. When it arrived, the meat was very fatty and it must have been a small duck. It came with little pieces and the second course (lettuce wrap) was also a smaller portion than usual. 

stir fried lobster with silverfish & garlic: Unlike most places, they do not charge by weight. It is a fixed price of $23.99.. not sure for how much but the lobster was also very small. It was probably a pound. it wasnt that good either. I wouldnt get this dish again and this dish is always a must whenever my family goes to a chinese restaurant.

oyster with ginger & green onion hotpot: the oysters pieces were actually very big, almost double the size of a usual oyster. However, it was a little fishy. 

Clams with chili black bean sauce: congee wong's is better. I wouldnt say this dish sucked, it was just okay. 

fish head with ginger & onion hotpot: the fish was very smooth and tender. 

house fried rice: too salty. only good thing about this dish is that the eel was a decent size but it was a little fishy.

The service
Terrible. But I am going to give this place the benefit of the doubt. It was a Sunday AND it was father's day. My two star rating is for the food only."}
{"text":"My biggest problem with this place: horrendous service, even for a Chinese restaurant. Came on a weeknight, after the dinner rush. It was less than half fill, and plenty of wait staff. 

Let's start with the good: 
Food was pretty good, slightly above average for typical Chinese restaurant prices. 

Orders came out quickly (which is to be expected, as most dishes don't require much time). 

Meal came with dessert, which was a nice touch! And that's pretty much the end of the good. 

The bad:
Every single request during dinner had to be repeated. Asked for two bowls of rice when the dishes came out. Asked again when we didn't get any and we're part way through munching. Asked a third time when still nothing came out. Strike one. 

Their chicken with ginger and green onion oil was SALTY. Might have been a bad batch of marinating, but the amount of salt in that was enough for another chicken. Strike two. 

Flagged a waiter down to get the bill and take out boxes. Waiter acknowledged (made eye contact, nodded) but then never came. Strike 3.

Asked for a pot of hot water instead of tea. Still came back with a pot of tea. Strike 4.

Incompetent cashier. Went to pay cash on a $50 something bill with $70 to get change back for tips. Cashier emphasizes that there is no tips included in the bill. (Please note, to pay $70, there has to be bills that add up to $50). Explained to cashier that we only wanted four $5 bills back to pay tips. Cashier still does not understand. It honestly should not be this hard to pay for a meal. BIG strike 5.

In all, even if the food was decent, it was too much work and much too frustrating for it to be worth my time. There are plenty of equally good restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Solid 4.5 stars for sure. This place is always packed for dinner, the rating is for food. Service is so-so, may be because they are so busy running around all the time, English is not the first language (they understand and speak, but it's usually loud making communication a little more difficult). 
We got all kinds of dishes over the past couple of years since they opened, consistent taste and quality and performance. It's good! 
Restaurant is clean.

They work really fast though, despite the service issue"}
{"text":"Good service. Excellent food. Every dish we had, including the soup, satisfied my 'yum' factor! It can be a busy place on certain days. In my opinion, the tables are very close to each other, hence it can be a 'tight' feel inside. Even the parking lot isn't that large. But well worth the satisfaction of the 'yum' factor!"}
{"text":"Favourite place for congee and some chinese dishes. Reasonable price, tasty and wide selection of menu."}
{"text":"Arguably the best Asian cuisine north of Dundas and Spadina.

The food is so fresh, it practically \"slaps you\" with flavor and perfect cooking.  The wait staff is also very pleasant.  I always judge a great Asian restaurant if there are far more Asian people than us. 

We had the Chili Turnip Patties (R7).  Ask for them to be extra crispy.  Best dish as an appy.  It is our staple \"goto\" dish.  The soups are also amazing - whether Hot & Sour or the Wonton.  The chicken dishes are never stringy.  Everything is very flavorful.  We took some friends from NYC who are not Asian but speak fluent Mandarin.  Thought the food was some of the best they have eaten."}
{"text":"Food at this restaurant is amazing. It's very affordable as well! Everything was splendid except for the fact that it was very noisy."}
{"text":"The food is average. But the service is horrible. It's their first day too. They are disrespectful and plainly just ignore your questions. We had two dishes not come out. We asked three times and were just ignored. Same issue with other questions as well. Absolutely frustrating. I cannot emphasize how much the service makes you feel like \"eat, shut up, get out\"."}
{"text":"Menu: https://www.just-eat.ca/restaurants-mr-congee-chinese/menu

What we recommend: Lobster super bowl, fried chili turnip patties, chu-hau beef tendons with beef brisket, deep fried squid tentacle, stir fried lobster with silver fish and garlic, house fried rice (eel, rish roe, crab meat), stir fried beef with mushroom.

Taste: 9/10

Most of their appetizers (fried) tastes great.  Well seasoned and served in large portions (remember to eat them before they get cold).  You can't go wrong with any of their congee, we just listed our favorite one.  The house fried rice has chunks of bbq eel and other seafood, and is drizzled with their home-made sauce (kind of like a thicker/sweeter version of soy sauce).  Meat dishes (non-bbq) can be hit or miss, most of their beef is tender and flavorful, but we found the chicken to be a little bit dry (have not tried any pork yet).  Seafood wise, the fried lobster with silverfish delivers a savoury meat with an added crunch (highly recommend).

What to stay away from: Tofu (not very well flavored), Bak Choy and broccoli related dishes (bland and doesn't taste fresh)

Value: 9/10

6-7$ For most apps (these are very large portions, on par with a main dish, again highly recommend).  9-15$ for meat dishes. 10-20$ for seafood. 5-10$ for congee. 7-12$ for rice.
Prices are fairly on par with the standard Chinese restaurant.  Meat dishes which contain veges tend to come in 40/60 (meat/vege ratio).  

**Average cost per diner: 15$ After Tax+Tip

Service / Convenience: 4/10

Self serve in terms of ordering, you write your orders on a piece of paper they provide you (each item has a simple to write code like: A8) and then hand that to the server.  You can add additional items by getting another paper or just telling a server.  The restaurant is very crowded and loud at all times, and parking can be hard to find during peak hours (you can park at the London Pub just beside it and walkover).

Not the friendliest servers, which is understandable because they are so busy.  Service can also be a bit slow during peak hours.

*Note: if you want take out, place your order at the front counter (which is conveniently located in the back of the restaurant).  Orders under a certain amount (20$ I believe) must be paid in cash.  It is usually ready in 10-15 mins, great if you're in a hurry.

Would go back? Yes, regularly for a tasty and quick meal.

Would recommend to friend? Yes, but only those who value food over service.

Similar places: Too many to list, basically any restaurant with \"congee\" in its name.

**Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza (16\") in one sitting."}
{"text":"Located right outside of Bridlewood Mall, Mr Congee is a great place to get your congee fix! It's small however and usually pretty crowded. They have a BBQ section where you can get meats to go. I usually come here for their Deep Fried Squid Tentacles which I highly recommend! For $7.75 you get a big plate of crispy fried squid tentacles, cheaper than ones you get at dimsum, the portion is huge! The congee here is pretty good, not too watery and just the right consistency without having too much MSG. The servers are generally nice, and come periodically to refill the tea."}
{"text":"I do not write reviews often but after my several experiences at this location, I thought it was time to write a full review. There is a lot of positive things to say about their food; the chefs do a fantastic job at making the food. From eating at various asian restaurants, I could safely say their food is top notch. The food makes you want to keep going back. I usually go with my grandparents and they love the food which makes me very happy. The space a bit small for the crowd they attract and they should definitely expand at some point for their customers. Despite the excellent food, the terrible service ruins the entire experience, especially with the lady that assigns seats to the customers. She is the same lady that assigns the seats every time I go to this restaurant. I usually go in the evenings.

FOOD: The food is amazing, it is always fresh and in nice portions. The price is also great for the food you get. I usually go in a large group and we usually order the Peking Duck Wrap, The House Congee, Fried Turnip Paddies, Fried Lobster with Silver Fish and Garlic, Cantonese Fried Noodle, a vegetarian dish, and Double Steamed Chicken. You never leave disappointed about the food. 

SERVICE: Like mentioned above, the one single lady seating the customers can ruin your entire experience. I went with my family for my birthday and her unprofessional, arrogant and rude attitude should get her fired. Her lack of professionalism is shown through all aspects of her tasks. Every time I put in a reservation, I would end up waiting 30 to 45 minutes for a seat. I understand the shop is busy but she should not be taking reservations if its not possible to uphold them. When you arrive and tell her that you made a reservation, she says she will get you a seat soon. However she forgets you and when you remind her, she asks who you are again and then adds you on the list. In addition, you would see her clearly whispering to other coworkers about customers. There was once when we just paid the bill and were finishing our dessert, she started clearing out the table. She accidentally hit the last person finishing up their dessert at our table and that person apologized. Instead she sarcastically said \"Just take your time\" in Chinese. However that person did not understand and another waitress translated to English for him. She then stands beside the table watching us finish our dessert, trying to hurry us out of the restaurant. You can see her whispering to another coworker about us. My grandparents are the sweetest people in the world and thought she was being nice so they were thanking her. This lady then says \"Okay okay, I am going to give you guys some cookies\" walks off to get some fortune cookies and comes back to give it to us to say \"Thank you very much, happy new year and now leave\" in a very rude tone. She gives off an impression that just because people do not understand what she is saying, she is entitled to say whatever she likes no matter how rude it may be. That is a form of bullying and the restaurant can do so much better without her. 

Part of her unprofessional and rude attitude is probably due to the lack of space the restaurant has. She has to work under pressure to please the customers and give them tables that serve their needs. However, her arrogant attitude is rooted from the true nature of her personality. I am not sure if she is the manager but she sure needs some training or simply get fired. I will be formally submitting a complaint to the owner on their website or calling if necessary to detail all the other incidents that occurred with the same lady.

CONCLUSION: If you just want to find a place for some really good Chinese food, this place will not disappoint you. However if you are trying to find a place for a group to socialize and have a good time, better find somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food was good and arrived relatively quickly, but more importantly it came together. The food was very tasty, but a little bit on the salty side. I would recommend the Peking duck. Unlike other Peking duck that I have tried in the past, there was a good amount of meat on each slice and it was moist. 

Be careful to look over your utensils. One of the sets had a dirty spoon and plate. 

The waiting staff was nice but quite busy. Sometimes it was difficult to get their attention. 

I would definitely come back with family and friends, but I would limit the size of my party to a maximum of ten people.

There was a line up for smaller groups (less than 8). The larger tables were empty till around 7:30 then they filled up very quickly."}
{"text":"This place is not very good if you compare it with Congee Wong or Congee Queen. The food does come out piping hot like it been deep fried even for stir fry dishes. I ordered:

Salty fish chicken fried rice - 4/10
Salt and pepper pork chop - 6/10
Beef stir fry in golden bowl - 6/10
Singapore turnip dish - 4/10

Overall the place is good since it isn't so packed. I got a seat at 7pm on a Sunday without waiting. If you're okay with lots of msg in your dish where you get the thirst on afterward. Then this place is for you. I do see the attraction for people who live in the area but i wouldn't venture out here for this place."}
{"text":"Honestly stay away, went here for Sunday dinner was told by family it was a good place to eat, Tables are super close together, Service is terrible, You write down what you want on a piece of paper and are forced to decode poorly translated menus.

Ordered the \"BBQ Pork Rice\" thinking it was pork fried rice instead a plate of steamed veg and ricewith slices of pork show up, told the manager this is not what i wanted and she brings over the scrap of paper i had written on and told me its my mistake and have to accept it, I took the food cause i was pretty done with this place, the food is terrible, restaurant is dirty, Washrooms are never clean so only knows what is lurking in the kitchen.

Ordered the whole BBQ duck mostly bones no meat think i had a duck with an eating disorder. 

Finished our meal and suddenly had the worst stomach cramps of my life, thank god i was only 2 mins from home.

Stay away for your health and wallet, Cant understand why it is so busy."}
{"text":"Just your average Chinese restaurant. The service and food really depends on the day and time you go. The prices are a bit on the pricer side considering the quality.
 
The shiu yook (Chinese BBQ'd meat) really stands out though, as it was melt in your mouth delicious. However, lots of the dishes are REALLY oily - so avoid if you aren't tryna get pimples!  

One time we got the set meal, and a large soup came with the meal. The soup was SUPER oily tasting and was super disappointing. The flavour was literally pure oil. Disgusting. 

For whoever goes, I hope you're luckier than me and don't get the oily ass soup"}
{"text":"There's a nice patio if anybody is interested? Not that I've ever seen people eat by the patio before. It is a Chinese restaurant after all. 

However, I must say this place is doing quite well! Considering there's not that many decent Chinese restaurants around Yonge/Major Mac, this is our go to restaurant whenever we are around the area and we enjoy it. 
We were also there on a Wednesday night (around 9) and there were still lots of people, which is good for them! This place does open till 11. 

Been here for lunch and dinner. We usually order the spicy clams (although it is hit or miss because sometimes a lot of the shells may be empty), congee (because how can you not have congee at Mr. Congee), or fried rice/noodles (for lunch) and many other things from the menu. The nice thing about this place is there are lots of options to choose from."}
{"text":"So the family and I chose Chinese food to celebrate my dad and sisters birthdays. The parking lot was really dark as there is not much lighting. The exterior of the restaurant was decent, and had Christmas lighting for the holiday season. When we first entered I thought to myself \"great interior, and very spacious\", as most Chinese restaurants are very small and crammed. The food was pretty good, very similar to other Chinese restaurants, but the presentation of most of the foods were a bit above par. The service was the downfall of this place, as it was pretty difficult to get the attention of our waitresses, but then again most Chinese places don't provide the best service. They are more about the quick turnover rate. Feed you quick and next!! Overall I'd say this place is average. But a great spot to have a Chinese restaurant on Yonge Street in Richmond Hill. That's pretty hard to find. Jimstar out!"}
{"text":"The food quality is mediocre. However, within an hour of sitting in the restaurant, I observed that the waitresses here are so clumsy. They either drop utensils on the floor couple times, or they delivered the dishes to the wrong table several times. Also, the floor is super dirty, and the lady washroom is super dirty and stinky."}
{"text":"We ordered a lunch special and a dumpling soup noodle on a weekday.  In terms of food, the flavour and the ingredients were A-OK.  The lunch special was presented in a big combo plate.  I had never seen this presentation before.  It was a cross between Western plating and a bento box.  Both the lunch combo and the soup noodle were well portioned.  Services was average.  The decoration and seating were quite nice.

For lunch, don't expect the experience to be earth shattering at Mr Congee.  It is predictable, and in a good way."}
{"text":"I must say, the food was great and the service was good; however, booking reservation for 15 and specifically asking for a round table was a complete disappointment....  we've arrived at the restaurant 10 minutes earlier (5:50pm) for our reservation, but we weren't seated till 45 minutes later....  furthermore, we weren't even seated on a round table.  I'm sad because the food was great but won't come back again...."}
{"text":"A congee / noodle / rice restaurant located at Bridlewood Mall. Food and service are consistently good. I always go early in the morning or just after the dinner rush - never during peak hours, so I've never had an issue getting a table. And the servers are actually really attentive and quick. 

I usually go in the morning for congee brunch/breakfast. They offer GIANT bowls of congee - ranging from $10-14 depending on what you order. You could probably easily get 10 individual bowls of congee. So it's a good item to call if you have a bunch of people who like congee. The Mr. Congee seafood special congee is what we typically order - it has an assortment of seafood, including shrimp, squid, scallops, imitation crab. The congee's consistency is pretty decent here - It's not too thick or watered down.  

fried dough - cruller / dough stick - I find it too oily for my liking- 

The fried rice and fried noodle dishes are good too...good portions! Chow mein is crispy and not entirely drowned in sauce (which I find at most other places). 

The individual soup noodles is def. bang for your buck. About $5 a bowl, they have an assortment of different types of noodles and toppings to choose from, ie: beef tendon, wonton, etc It's a HUGE portion and splitting a bowl with another person would be wise. 

stir fried turnip cake with green onions, eggs, bean sprouts and dried shrimp and roughly chopped garlic comes in spicy xo sauce or you can ask them to do soy sauce stir fry. Oh so tasty! crispy on the outside and it just almost melts when your sink your teeth into a piece. So good!

The rice noodle rolls are good too - I usually go for plain - street style. - comes with peanut sauce, and hoison on the side and pour your own soy sauce. It comes in a bowl and long skewers - fun to eat! Tip: ask for chilli sauce as well.. the trifecta of hoison, peanut and chilli sauce makes this dish complete. 

I know they do dinner service as well (wor choy) - shared main dishes. I've tried a couple of times, and nothing really stands out.  

Tons of parking in the mall parking lot. 

As other people mentioned, they could do a better job at rearranging their table placements and layout. It does get quite loud in there."}
{"text":"Pad Thai too orange. Probably shouldn't order a Thai dish in a hk style joint. Roast pork great,  duck was tasty but very oily,  kidney on point"}
{"text":"This is the hang out place my family and I have been going to for the past year. 

Food is delicious and there is always a wait for dinner, so make sure you call in advance to reserve a table - especially when coming as a big group! The one time we didn't call ahead, it was a 45 min wait!

We typically order the set dinner which is a lot of food! But it's always delicious!"}
{"text":"Cheap food for a low price. If you're going on a budget, you should come here. The food is rather bland, though.

Service was meh."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the poor service I'd give this a 4.  It took them 30 minutes and 4 servers to get us cold water.  The first girl didn't speak English, didn't get help, and avoided our table afterwards, the second server delegated it to someone else who forgot, and the third person got distracted by another server who was ranting about bills. I should have gotten up and poured myself the damn glasses.  So rude.  The food on the other hand was great.  Next time I will have to remember to bring my own water bottles so I don't choke on my meal."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Hidden in a strip mall  with more parking space than shops, this place has great food!! Free boiled shrimp with $38 purchase. The food here is inexpensive and fresh, delicious and you can adjust the saltiness if you prefer less sodium. We ordered congee, fish with corn sauce, salty fish fried rice, and a few other things i forgot because the food coma got to me. The only memory i left with was yums! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is hands-down mine and my family's favorite and go-to restaurant haha. We live super close but also because the quality and portions here have always been consistent. Consistency is so rare these days especially with price inflation lol. Our favourites are the turnip, calamari, salmon-head, pineapple fried rice, eel fried rice, their tofu and broccoli dish, pea shoots and mushroom dish and so on. Some dishes are mediocre so be careful with what you order. Definitely highly recommend this place! It tends to be super busy though so just a heads up. It is also pretty loud- your typical Asian place really aha."}
{"text":"Good food at reasonable prices but the service needs a serious makeover. Was barely served and we waited forever to get our bill so just decided to goto the front desk and get our bill

I prefer the warden location better, food  and service is better"}
{"text":"What a bustling joint where all the locals go. The food is outstanding. Perfect roast pork with careful presentation of the prized crispy skin. Fresh and perfectly done boiled pork liver and kidneys w/special soy. Free range poached chicken with ginger green onion sauce was dead on home style cooking. And the lobster jook was worth getting just to sample and look at. Warning - Saturday night at prime time can be crazy."}
{"text":"Honestly I'm not sure why the ratings here are so low! This place has become one of my family's go-to dinner places since Congee Queen and other similar type restaurants started losing consistency and food quality. Although there are times when service has not been the greatest given some servers cannot communicate very well, the dishes here offer generous portions and consistency. We love the roast duck here! The menu is very extensive - there is your classic congee restaurant items - fried rice and noodle dishes, vegetables, soup noodles and Chinese bbq items. They even have skewers and pho! The place is also quite packed all the time but food always comes out really quick. Overall, this place has yet to disappoint."}
{"text":"Nearly a regular here and I'm always warmed by both the service and hot food. Everyone is always kind no matter what time I go and the food is excellent value--especially during afternoon tea hours. A solid place."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed the food here. I just wasn't very comfortable eating in because I felt like it's slightly dirtier than most usual Chinese restaurant and that is probably due to the rain. However, the food here was good. We got 8 oysters for $16.99 and two other dishes that I don't know the name of. I really don't think you can go wrong with anything here!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in the Hill.... 
Portions are more then enough for the price and the selection of menu items is beyond enough. Sometimes it's hard to choose which items to eat cause there are so mannnnyyyy delicious items. 
Mmmmmmm.... I would recommend this place to everyone. 
Servers could smile about more but they are very friendly and willing to help u if u don't know what something is on the menu. 
Just one thing they always have snow crab on special but every time it's \"sold out\" opsie!"}
{"text":"I couldnt find any info on their afternoon tea until I got there. Afternoon tea is from 3pm-5pm, same price as their regular menu but with free drink. Going for the red bean ice cream freeze seems to be the the best of valued drink amongst the choices for free drinks. I've been here usually for dinner and lunch and you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Always find myself coming back here for their Salted Egg and Pork congee. By far the best I've tried compared to many bigger congee franchises in the GTA. Afternoon tea special is of great value as well. Large portions with free iced drinks from bubble tea to red bean drink (many places charge extra). Too bad it doesn't start until 3pm. 

On the weekends, it can get super busy so expect to have to wait. Also, they don't accept credit unless you order $10 or more. Unfortunately, the place (floors, tables) were a bit on the dirtier side in my opinion. If they had kept their place a bit cleaner they would get 5 stars in my books."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch, service was terrible. Waitress was grumpy and unfriendly. Food was ok but not great."}
{"text":"Went to Mr. Congee Saturday around 9pm for dinner.
Sat down, was offered one menu, a paper to write down our order with a pencil.
Flagged down a server passed him our order.
While inspecting our dishware we found one tea cup was dirty.
The waiter replaced it with a clean one.

The food came out quickly considering the restaurant was quite busy at the time.
We ordered the House Super Bowl Congee and Fried Turnip Patties
The congee is noticeably better than Congee Queen, and Congee Wong however I found the added hokkigai was like chewing rubber and was non edible.
The bowl the congee came in was fancy like in the pictures but it had a fairly large chip. Although the bowl can still be used, for a restaurant this is not a good impression.

The friend turnip patties were good, they were not overly oily like some other places.

We left the restaurant with left overs and felt that the food was good enough for us to visit regularly when we have congee cravings.

Most of the diners were oriental with few Caucasians so you know the Chinese food is good. One must understand that this Chinese restaurant is not influenced by the Western culture. Considering this, the service is not good, far from the Mandarin so you can measure.

1 star was lost for the dirty tea cup / large chipped congee bowl
1 star was lost for the rubber hokkigai it was just not edible (after chewing 10 times it would not even chip apart, my girlfriend also tried and failed miserably)

The bill including tip was $21 and change.

Would I visit here again? We definitely would
Would I recommend a friend? An oriental friend yes
Why only oriental? Because we are use to good food = crappy service"}
{"text":"Tried the BBQ pork there today.  Soft and tender with a good marinade.  Not salty and a lot le$$ expen$ive than I have paid at my usual go-to BBQ place.  Took the BBQ to go.  Sat down and ordered the chong-fan (which arrived cold), and the congee consistency could have been thicker.  Having said that, we did not leave anything on our plates ... there are dishes here which are tried and true:  generally the congee is good, the grouper and tofu hotpot, turnip cakes and a variety of fried rice dishes."}
{"text":"Higher end version of Congee Queen, there's a lot of seafood to be found here. 

The food is adequate and tasty. The menu is large. The congee options are limitless.

For a simple fun meal, this is a good spot."}
{"text":"Not the most impressive Chinese food you can find in Richmond Hill, but not bad. It lacks the authentic feel I like to see, and has the feel of Manchu Wok in a more Chinese environment. The BBQ pork was impressive, but other than that everything fell flat for me. The wonton soup was bland, the fried udon was mushy and the shrimp were undersized and over cooked. Why settle for mediocre Chinese in Richmond Hill?"}
{"text":"Tried Mr. Congee for the first time, and it was not good. The standard flat noodles were slightly burnt and the shrimp chips that came with the chicken were \"soggy\" ... the server explained that it was late in the day and they had been in the kitchen all day ... what kind of an explanation was that? They got us new chips but too little too late. 

Richmond Court or Congee Queen are much better alternatives for same price."}
{"text":"Really good roast goose and roast pork! Take out is quick and easy and they deliver if you spend over 30$"}
{"text":"Food is still delicious! We got take out yesterday instead of cramming ourselves into a restaurant along with all the other Valentine's Day couples. We got the veggie fried rice, shrimp rice noodle roll, spring rolls, & some meat dishes for the hubby. Yum!"}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 4/5
This place is located on Warden Ave and Finch Ave E near Bridlewood Mall. There are plenty parking spots outside the restaurant. 

[SERVICE] - 2/5
Below average service. Our server seemed so unhappy to take our order and bring us our food. She did not even say bye to us when we left, even though we were one of the few customers there. 

[DÉCOR] - 2/5 
Chinese style with round tables and chairs. The booth that I sat at was dirty and had crumbs on the seat. 

[QUALITY] - 3/5
Average quality. Worth the price for a cheap meal. 

[ORDER] - 3.5/5
- Shredded Chicken & Duck with Egg Super Bowl Congee - I wanted something bland with minimal seasoning, and this totally hit the spot!

- Sweet and Sour Pork - surprisingly good, not coated with too much dough, and presented very nicely in a pineapple! Unfortunately, I wasn't a big fan of the pieces that touched the pineapple because it made the pork taste too acidic. 

- Fried Chilli Turnip Patties - a great value for this dish. It tasted pretty good, and I had no complaints! 

[OVERALL] - 3/5 
Good place if you crave some solid and cheap Chinese food. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place, but this is just a good option if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I would give the food here 4 stars, service 3 stars and decor here 2 stars. Overall I really enjoyed the food (we ordered the Cantonese Chow Mein) and it had a decent amount of seafood mixed in to it) I agree, if you only speak English here you will probably not receive the best service here, but overall the food and pricing makes up for it. Everything I had here was very fresh and flavourful, would I come back? Yes."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for several years, usually coming by for their afternoon tea specials with the free ice cream red bean drink. 

The quality of the food is pretty decent, 4 to 4.5/5 on average given the price point of the restaurant. Some of my most common orders include rice with BBQ duck and the fried turnip. Both are soft and juicy on the inside with a crunchy exterior. Most other dishes I've tried also range from above-average to superb compared to Congee Queen.

The quality of the service is around 2 to 3/5. It varies, though generally it is worse than Congee Queen. Normally it is acceptable, but when it gets busy on weekends/holidays the system completely breaks down, with wrong dishes/drinks being flung out everywhere by aggravated staff. They have a relatively small number of staff and a very high employee turnover, meaning all the newbies are completely clueless when they see a surge of people."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant is good, we brought the leftover food that we couldn't finish at the restaurant. When I reheated the pineapple fried rice dish I noticed something silver...... I found some sort of metal in the rice! Omg imagine one of my kids ate this.... I have no idea what it is"}
{"text":"My family comes to Mr. Congee for the garlic silverfish lobster (which is amazing and reasonably priced) and for the Peking Duck (served two ways) which is my father's favourite.  We do not go for the service!  You have to adjust your expectations about the service at this restaurant.   It feels like you are in the middle of Grand Central Station with the servers yelling to each other throughout the entire restaurant.  In my experience, the servers are generally too rushed and too busy to waste their time on my table and in the 7-8 times that I have been here, I have never had a friendly server.  However, the location is close to home, the price is right and the food is good (and is served relatively quickly) so we keep coming back.  They do take reservations for parties of 5 or more."}
{"text":"Their dinners are fantastic. Not too sure why there are so many low ratings, but there was a recent change of management so come try it out again. Their deep fried oysters are fresh, and so worth the long wait"}
{"text":"Mr. Congee has become a frequent stop for our family - especially when looking for Chinese food.  We love their congee and BBQ, and actually most of their food is very delicious - a place that we come here often."}
{"text":"This place is crazy busy most of the time. The tables are close together and it is Noisy but the food is legit. It's as good as congee Wong or congee queen. The service isn't great but what Chinese place really has amazing service? You go for the food and then leave as fast as you can. It's not a wine and dine restaurant...stop crying!"}
{"text":"I have been this location a few times,seems not that busy as that they have other one in Scarborough, food is decent, service need to improve."}
{"text":"Not sure why the rating is low as I've had a great experience everytime I come here. It's a decent place in Richmond Hill and I liked their lobster dish. Their afternoon tea menu also has competitive prices and their portions are big.  I noticed they had JustEat  services too!"}
{"text":"The prices are relatively lower than most Chinese restaurants, so expect the food to reflect these prices. I'm not a picky eater so I thought the food was fine, but I can understand why those who have gone to more upscale Chinese restaurants may find the food mediocre. 

There is a lot of parking spaces since this restaurant is attached to Bridlewood Mall. However, it does get extremely busy after 6:00pm so expect to wait in line for awhile if coming in after this time. The waiting area is also extremely small and I've seen it get packed with people really quickly. This restaurant also only takes reservations for big groups only."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the nice decor, it's filthy dirty here and the floors look like they've never been swept. I was so disgusted with all the food and dirty napkins on the floor. Thankfully they heard me complain and proactively got someone to sweep our area. Docking a star for how dirty it is. 

Food here is not bad, it's your typical Chinese cuisine. Comes fast, which is good. Weirdly enough we didn't order any congee. We went with the \"dinner style\" items such as tofu with vegetables, lobster and Chinese free run chicken, They also have Peking duck which was ok, really fatty though. Overall it does the job, but it's not the best. 

They also give you complimentary Chinese dessert at the end of your meal, which tasted average at best. I know it's free but there are definitely other Chinese restaurants with better tasting complimentary desserts."}
{"text":"Mixed impressions about this place,
First of all, It's not the cleanest, glasses with finger prints on them, dirty plates, plates presentation is inconsistent and all over the place.
Large menu with some really wide selections, the menu is all in chinese language with very little english, so unless you know your chinese cuisine, you'll probably be lost in translation.
Customer service is poor, a lot of it has to do with the language barrier probably. Prices are okay, average and you do get bigger portions for what it's worth.

Flavours are definitely there, authentic and delicious..that's the only positive thing I would say about Mr Congee!"}
{"text":"I usually get take-out from Mr. Congee and it's pretty good Chinese food.  It's better than most of the other similar restaurants like congee wong, I would say their food quality is better than Congee Wong.  Their prices are are reasonable and portions are quite large."}
{"text":"Pictures of the ?????? & ???? are on my Instagram.

Per usual, the ?????? was smashing. However, there are Chinese herbs in the soup which may not be to everyone's taste. I am tremendously fond of the addition of the herbs because it makes for a unique flavour. Moreover, there are numerous health benefits from the herbs. However, I don't suggest eating the herbs themselves as that's the norm. In fact, they're often trashed afterwards because they no longer retain the desired nutrients. There is enough chicken to satisfy two hungry adults and plenty of leftover soup. I suggest using the leftover soup at home to cook with, but I don't recommend drinking it as is due to excessive sodium. The chicken was good; I've ordered black chicken before instead which was just as good. Both the soy sauce-chilli dip and scallion and ginger dip were average, nothing to write home about. 

Similarly, the ???? was great. I'm not confident this is large enough of a serving size for two adults with an appetite. Texture and taste were on point, but a touch too oily. Overall, the quality of these two dishes are consistently good which is partially the reason why I've ordered both countless of times. 

In spite of my praises, it's important to note that while it's good food, don't expect the best. If you're looking for the best, look elsewhere. This is a casual and affordable eatery with a rambunctious atmosphere. I say this because I've come across a many with unbelievably condescending attitudes. The best analogy I can think of at this moment is the contrasting attitudes towards Starbucks and McDonalds coffee consumers. Specifically, Starbucks coffee is often held in higher regard than McDonalds coffee and not necessarily for good reason."}
{"text":"Mr. Congee Chinese Cuisine is yet another \"Congee\" Place opened up in Scarborough area recently. It is located inside Briddlewood Mall, so there are plenty of parking, since the Mall is never busy!!

The menu setup is really similar to Congee Queen... colourful and easy to read. There are though stired fried lobster on the menu which they are having a special now for $9.99 if your order is over $20 before tax.

Plain Congee ($2.25) and Chili Turnip Patties ($5.50) both were A-OK. 

I came back to take advantage of their Afternoon Tea Specials priced from $4.45 Mon-Fri between 3 to 5 pm which includes a choice of bubble tea or even red bean ice cream drink! It was awesome both in value and quality!! I would definitely come here more often to take advantages of that!

The service is not bad... the waitress was even nice enough to tell the table next to me not too order too much....and can add more if they need more. That's always a good sign that they are honest."}
{"text":"Mr Congee serves more than Congee, just want to get that out of the way.

The menu is really extensive. A step up from Congee Queen as they even offers fresh lobsters and fish that are still swimming in the tank.

Here you do get value as the portion size is huge. Make sure you don't order too much! But you can always have leftovers as lunch the next day.

The quality of the food is quite standard in a good way. And everyone would find something they enjoy.

The interior is spacious and well laid out. High ceiling and comfortable seating. 

I would be back again for a late dinner (closes at 11 pm) or even afternoon tea special when I am in the area, There are not too many good decent restaurant in the area so Mr. Congee would be doing well."}
{"text":"We went to mr congee and the waitress did not speak English i ordered chicken noodle soup with vegetable. They brought us a soup with pork tripe. I told them that's not what i order ,it wasn't  hot we found and then to top it off there was a fly in the soup oh one more thing I've ask them to bring us a fork and knife and spoon they were dirty. I tried to found the head office but no luck never going back there again"}
{"text":"mediocre food from this restaurant. A resto that offers a bit too much variety could never be good because they don't specialize in a specific cuisine. Clay pot rice mediocre,the spare ribs were lacking in taste and there was not much meat in the pot. The sweet sauce with fried oysters were awesome though because of the gigantic oysters perfectly fried.
shreaded chicken with jelly fish and cucumbers was dissapointed,it looked nice on the picture,but didn't taste anything crazy. The veggie portion of the tao miu and mushrooms were tasty and huge and i liked it.

Overall not bad,but there are much better places"}
{"text":"I liked the efoo noodles and lobster congee.(about 1 pound of lobster per dish) 22 dollars each, worth the price

Pineapple fried rice had a good amount of sea food and tasted fresh.

Fried vermicelli was clean tasty and not oily.

I asked for less oil and msg, it was missing salt a little bit,mayb next time i wont.

Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Location is quite small and seems a lot more short staffed than the one at Richmond Hill, service was quite poor on my visit. 

Food is on par with other congee restaurants (at sometimes lacking taste) although prices have spiked, but the menu continues to be quite limited in comparison to Congee Queen or Wong. 

Would recommend the Richmond hill location or rather Congee Queen over this particular location."}
{"text":"Mr Congee is probably your best bet for Chinese food within the Hillcrest Mall area of Richmond Hill. It's everything you would typically expect: extensive menu, table cloth round tables for large parties, square tables for small parties, tea and water inclusive. You have your seafood live display off to the side, and the overall ambiance is pretty clean and rustic. There's nothing PARTICULARLY special about this place though. 

Here's what we ordered

- deep fried radish patties - pretty good. Standard portion size. Oddly symmetric cubes!
- Deep fried talipia with teriyaki sauce - this one was okay. You can't really go wrong with deep fried foods and sauce :~)
- Snow pea shoots and king oyster mushroom stir fry - pretty good. Like the flavour, and not too greasy!
- Chicken and mushroom Hot Stone casserole rice - not that good. could not tell the rice was coooked in a hot stone. The sauce was flavourless. The chicken was not lean (mostly bone, skin, and fat). Would highly not recommend, especially for the wait time and price

Come to Mr Congee for some good (but not GREAT!!!!) authentic Chinese food"}
{"text":"I have a love-hate relationship with this particular Mr Congee location. I love their food, but I hate their service. I generally only come here because it's conveniently close to home. But again, the service is terrible.

We regularly order two dishes, the seafood super bowl congee and the fried chili turnip patties. They're both taste phenomenal, once it arrives at your table. The fried chili turnip may burn you twice, though, if you know what I mean. They also have an afternoon tea special from 3:00pm to 5:00pm where you can get a free ice cream float drink with an order of certain items (the congee and the turnip patties qualify). We usually get the red bean ice cream float. There are also some side dishes that you can order for $2 as part of afternoon tea. Overall a really good deal.

Observing the servers here, there doesn't seem to be any system to the madness. Food comes out in random order, so you may have ordered before another table but they may receive their food before yours, even if you order similar items. You may believe you have ordered and it may have not been entered. Finally, you'll get hassled to pay by cash but if you persist long enough they'll let you pay by debit."}

??????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Service is horrible. This place is very loud and not very clean. I would much rather to congee queen. Same portion, around the same price and much cleaner."}
{"text":"This place was honestly so cramped and squished together the wait staff couldn't even access half the table to clear it for us. it was absolutely the wrong way to set up a restaurant. The waitstaff also don't speak much english, so let that be known if it's important to you to be able to communicate needs or preferences to waitstaff. I came with a group of 13 people, we sat against a wall in a booth type thing. we ordered a lot of food. the waitress had to come and bring us food several times. each time, she almost tripped over the table adjacent to us bc it was JUST SO cramped. also several times when bringing us napkins or cutlery she had to lean over the adjacent table, and pass me the items b/c she just couldn't get around. same thing when she tried to clear our table: i had to pick up the dishes, and reach over the table beside me. i'm sorry but i don't want to have to interrupt my meal to tend to the waitstaff who are incapable of doing their job due to the set up of the restaurant. also, it couldn't have been very nice for the table sitting beside me either. 
but clearly none of this is to any detriment. for a restaurant in a mall, it was PACKED. Asians love this place. The prices are reasonable. Lots of families so it was loud. the food was decent, better than what you get downtown, but not the best. edible and acceptable for a family dinner. I won't be back although my family probably will be."}
{"text":"Located in bridle wood mall. This is probably the only thing busy in this whole place.  It's serving your usual canton fair.  Noodle and congee are good.  Comparable with Keungs. The lobster house special is the best. Definitely try if you haven't. It's their signature dish with little fried fishes on top. It's very very delicious. One of the best I've had.  Unfortunate points are deducted because it's always way too overcrowded and service suffers because of this.   Giving unique desserts is a bonus.  As everyone's tired of the typical red bean soup.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"The waiters are extremely rude. Don't bother coming here, there are plenty of other better congee places"}
{"text":"I have so much love for you, Mr. Congee. So much love.

First off, the menu is huge. There's congee (wow, no kidding, huh?), noodles, soup, lobster, BBQ pork, different kinds of chicken, crab, and so much more. There's no possible way to not find something you like at this restaurant. When they bring you the food, you can tell it's fresh. The prices are good...  not dirt cheap, but not overly expensive. When you see the portion sizes, you'll see that you're getting good value for your money.

The service is amazing, considering the crowds that this place gets. At lunch, dinner, and definitely on holidays, every seat is filled and there's still a crowd waiting at the door. The waiters are super fast... when someone leaves, the table's cleared and there's someone new sitting there in no time flat.

I come to this restaurant with my family fairly often, and I've had nothing but good experiences. I highly, highly recommend Mr. Congee."}
{"text":"With the wealth of congee places around Toronto, Mr. Congee has been my go to for the past year or so. Eating congee has always reminded me of being sick as a child but these congee places offer much more than your regular congee and fried dough sticks.

Similar menu compared to Congee Wong and Congee Queen but at a slightly cheaper price compared to both, and better quality and service than Congee Wong. I also find their dishes not as heavy on the salt as well.

Recommended items to try are the Special Eel Fried Rice, Turnip Cakes, and the stir fried Lobster with silverfish and garlic (not offered at many Chinese restaurants so worth a try here!). Everything else on the menu is pretty tasty as well so you can't go wrong with anything!

Come during afternoon tea (I believe it's 3-5pm) for even discounted deals and a free drink with every item ordered (get the red bean ice drink!).

This location is quite small and is attached to Bridlewood Mall so ample parking spaces. It's always packed here though and even if you make reservations, you can expect to wait a little too so I'd suggest making reservations and showing up 15 mins beforehand to ensure you get your table. A bit difficult fitting large groups of ~12+ as you're crammed into a large round table but anything below that should provide a comfy eating experience. They also do take out too and sell BBQ meats at the cash register."}
{"text":"Summary: a very nice congee restaurant that is extremely busy during rush hours

This place is very similar to some other congee restaurant I have been to, like Congee Queen, Congee Wong. The dishes tastes very similar. The food quality was not bad.
However, we came on Sunday night, this place was super busy and super packed. It took us around 30 minutes to get a table. We have to write down our own orders since all the waitresses are busy. The food came pretty quickly and it tastes pretty good."}
{"text":"Mr Congee caught my attention while on my way to work, so i decided to stop by on Saturday evening for a try.   The restaurant was packed!!!!  But i got a seat quickly, and they gave me a couple of menus to go through.  I ended up ordering Scallop & Tiger Shrimp congee (approx $6) and a jelly fish cold dish (approx $6).  The whole process was quite quick, and there was no language barrier.
The congee came and it was a rather large dish to the point where i had to pack the left over for another day.  Disecting the congee a little bit more? The scallops and shrimps were minimal.  The jelly fish was mixed with shredded cucumber, so it seemed like a lot.  Tasty and refreshing though.  A complimentary sweet potato soup was given at the end, which was nice.  It's a nice simple experience, and i would go back again."}
{"text":"This place was a bit of a disappointment. Considering the decor and environment looking like Congee Queen. Having almost the same menu items as Congee Queen. And relatively the same prices as congee queen with the addition of expensive things like $299 Peking Duck course and $250 crab courses and $33 Peking duck the food we got was very much sub par. 

The service isn't too bad I have to admit. Though the layout of the restaurant will leave those at the back side lacking in service. Much like Congee Queen on Steeles and Don Mills. At least my arm didn't get sore waving like Green Grotto highway 7. 

So we tried the house special fried rice. To be honest this would have been a good dish if they just didn't screw up on part. The rice. 

The toppings itself were unique with bonito and pieces of fish that looked like large insects in the picture they had.  Maybe I am colour blind or the lighting was off. The toppings themselves are good, but the rice ... Really ruined it for me. Fried rice is usually made with left over rice that had been put in the fridge. This one felt like it had just come from the rice cooker and had too soft a texture. On the border of mushy. I am like grumble grumble hoping the other dish we had would be better. Or at least fix up this dish.

No luck. 

I ordered the deep fried squid tentacles because the salt and pepper squid in the picture looked like I was going to have a hard time chewing. Unfortunately I also had a hard time chewing this dish. The best part of the dish for me was the garnish of carrots and parsley which had at least corrected the after taste of the tentacles. 

The service wasn't too bad. I would rate this a 2.5 star but because I didn't enjoy any food and I was really hungry that I just forced myself to eat the food rather than waste it. It was also at Congee Queen mains prices which are higher so I feel a bit more ripped off for the quality I got.  At least they gave us some free red bean soup. 

Anyway I decided to round this down to 2 stars. 

Not sure if I want to try their Peking duck to see how it compares to others on that price range such as Chung King Garden or Spring Villa. Well we'll see and hope that this is just a blip.

The service wasn't too bad they seem like nice people. I kind of wished they had that call button."}
{"text":"My family and I love coming here for dinner as we think it's one of the better tasting and better priced chinese restaurants in scarborough. 
Their service is usually very quick ( you can get all your dishes at your table in less than 10 mins)! 
This place does get busy, but again, they're really efficient. 
I don't really have much to complain about. 
I would recommend this restaurant if you are near by and would like a quick meal!"}
{"text":"Mr. Congee is really Mr. Everything.  They have seafood, BBQ, meats, veggie stuff, and congee - like all the other Congee places.  

I guess Congee is another word for Economical food.  Mr. Congee is surely that.  Fam and I have now settle on this place as our go to Congee place.  I have abandoned Congee Wong on 16th and Bayview - quality of the food was more than subpar the last few times.

Funny thing is that I have never had congee here.  Usual orders are spicy squid, turnip, black bean something, some kinda noodle, veggies, and rice.  We sometimes venture out of the norm to have lobster, pepper steak, and other recommendations.

All in all, the meal is fine.  Not going to win any foodie awards but keeps the kids fed and my wallet not as light as a dinner out at Yang's.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Looking for cheap eats in this area is hard if u don't wanna go a bit further. Mr.congee is 10x better than phoenix that opened around the corner. Been here once before 3 years ago. They gave us free boiled shrimp with order of $38 or more, not its $25 for b.c. crab if u order over $28, to complete ur meal with a family of 3. Its really worth it, nice cheap prices, quality food, good taste, OPEN after 10pm!!! I ordered soup noodle with BBQ duck, same taste as some good BBQ restaurants downtown (missing the book Choy though but I don't mind) for $6.99. Had boiled shrimp for $5.99 its  like almost a pound. And stewed beef soup noodle for $4.99 ( my bf had it. The beef was very yummy!) Highly recommend it if u want to have Chinese Cantonese styled dinner with family and friends  or late night meal with ur significant other :)"}
