{"text":"We just happened upon this place when looking for a coffee shop.  Saw the sign for Carl's cakes - which is now the home to Heritage Bakery & Cafe.  It was lunch time so we ordered sandwiches, and may I say they were amazing.  I had the chicken salad - on wonderful bread, and my husband had the hot ham sandwich.  For sides we had the spinach salad - so good! - and the pasta salad, ate every bit.  The baked goods looked wonderful and we took cookies to go.  Everything was really delicious and I would go out of my way to stop there again next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and had a fresh ice tea and an excellent sloppy joe sandwich!  Very clean dining area and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a bakery to open up near my house, and I was rewarded for my wait. There are several good Mexican bakeries in the area I enjoy, but they just aren't exactly what I want. 

Heritage is so simple inside, and you're not overwhelmed with too much to look at. I've had their apple croissant, coffee cake, and bear claw. All are amazing. Just the right amount of sweetness. Each thing I've had has had a unique little twist to it. The foods are traditional enough to be familiar, but different enough to make them exciting. 

The only complaints I have are they are a little expensive and I haven't been able to locate any loafs for sale. Maybe I've been too busy looking at all the good pastries."}
{"text":"Heritage just opened this week. It is in the former Carls Cakes location on Cottage Grove Rd. I bought a cheese bagel, a apple cinnamon scone, two raised glazed donuts and a cinnamon role. My total was $7.25. The pricing would be consistent with Panera.  The donuts were yummy. The bagel was hearty and filling. I would choose it over a Panera. The cinnamon scone was ok, half of it was bland the other half was filled with chunks of apple and cinnamon. The streusel topping though seemed lacking in taste. The cinnamon role was a disappointment. It tasted like they over beat the dough. The frosting was inconsistent and had granular sugar in it. But the basic taste was ok. Given that they just opened, I'm willing to give the cinnamon role another chance in a couple weeks. 
They've expanded the sit down eating area. I would have a cup of coffee and a pastry here."}
{"text":"I was SO excited to try this place.  It closes after 3, so it is hard to get into. This cafe is hidden in the corner of a long strip mall.  It is never busy.  The interior is not very cozy.  There are a few armchairs but mostly just tables and chairs.  

I ordered the chicken pesto sandwich.  It comes warm on ciabatta bread.  The sandwich was good.  There is nothing special about it.  You get a choice of side, I chose the side salad.  It was spinach with a balsamic vinaigrette. It was $7.50.  The sweets at the cafe looked good but again, there was nothing that stood out.  

It is a decent neighborhood place, but a little too plain for me to be a regular."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful hidden gem in my neighborhood that I finally took the time to seek out. We came here for lunch on a Saturday. I got the portabella sandwich & hubby got the basil pesto chicken sandwich and spinach salads as our side. Salads were a nice size for just being a side and the vinaigrette dressing was tasty. Sandwiches were very delicious and filling. 

Didn't order any bakery items buy boy, did that all look amazing!  The chocolate croissant would be my weakness.

Only downside is the limited hours of 7am-2pm Monday through Saturday (open until 3pm in winter we were told). Makes it hard for those of us with standard jobs to get here. It would be nice if they had some dinner hours a few nights a week."}
{"text":"I have been here thrice for lunch on weekdays. The food and service was great every single time. I am a big fan of the eclairs they make! I like the glass hangings they have!

I got their Portabella Sandwich today and everything was as good as ever except I could taste a banana in the middle. There wasn't one and I don't know why that would be so but it was just in two bites so I could manage it.

I also got their lemon bar which was yumm!!!
I am still a fan of this place.

Service - 5
Food - 4
Price - reasonable (the sandwiches are filling and you get a decent size of the side salad: I like both their side salads - spinach and pasta)"}
{"text":"Haven't been here yet. Wanted run & get donuts this morning. Why is a bakery closed on Sunday?"}
