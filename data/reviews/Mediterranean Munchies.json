{"text":"We've tried to dine here a few times but this place is ALWAYS closed. Its 530pm on a Saturday and though the hours indicate that they are open until 7pm  they were closed again. What a shame since this neighborhood could really use a decent shawarma place.  Not giving this place a try again. Too many strikes!"}
{"text":"Great Place Clean, Friendly Staff, Quick Service, Food Awesome Food
