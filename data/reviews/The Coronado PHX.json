{"text":"Who would have thought vegan/vegetarian food could be so good!? There is nothing here I don't like. The potato tacos and goat cheese/jalape√±o quesadilla are amazing. The coffee is great. The staff is very friendly. They often have cool little events like poetry reading, trivia night etc."}
{"text":"REALLY impressed with this place. i'll set the scene...it's a weekend and one of our reg spots, Green/Nami, is only offering brunch and is SLAMMED. we were too hungry to wait and we didn't want breakfast - it was 1 p.m. son!...as we're driving away looking for lunch, the girl says Coronado looks good. we try it.  all of the servers were attentive and on-point. the food was amazely! we tried the red bean quesadilla which was one of the best quesadillas i've ever had. we tried the chili which was a nice amount of spicy but not too much...the front person was kind enough to let us know the chili sitch, that it may be HOT. i liked the iced tea selections. i liked the crowd...not TOO full but a healthy stream of customers.  i'd imagine if more of the Green/Nami crowd knew about this place, which is like 100 feet away, Coronado would be even more busy. Coronado has a really creative menu with a lot of interesting combos (such as a red bean quesadilla). we look fwd to going back.  //we tried  the cookies, which didn't suit our tastes...the mexican chocolate cookie was too spicy and not chocolate enough; the rosemary chocolate chip was too rosemary-heavy...we might try more of the baked goods, but it would be nicer if they covered the croissants and such, instead of leaving them out in the open. there are too many transactions around that front area to leave exposed food. that's about the only complaint. the open-air set-up would just prevent us from ordering uncovered items near the register.//  prices: not high, not low. right in the middle we thought.  plenty of parking but a dirt lot - not ideal if yer car is just-washed.  overall a really cool old house funky vegan place that delivers on service and flavor. we will return. i hope the experience is consistently this enjoyable."}
{"text":"love, love , love this place!!!! they have great coffee and great employees!!  i come here daily! i use to be a starbucks junkie, not anymore!"}
{"text":"Another wonderful vegan restaurant in AZ ! Great food ! Excellent coffee ! Yummy pastries ! What more can one ask for ? There is outdoor and indoor seating. You order at the bar, pay, take a number and have a seat. They bring your order out to you hot, fresh and pretty quickly!  Staff are pretty cool, friendly and laid back here. The almond milk latte and breakfast sandwich was so delicious, I cant wait to come back !! Beware though parking kind of sucks though...."}
{"text":"The vegan cauliflower tacos were delicious! They have an on-site vegan baker and had a good selection of vegan sweets including scones and cupcakes that looked yummy. Happy Hour from 4pm to 7pm! Great spot!!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere! Cute and quaint little restaurant with yummy vegetarian options. The patio is so nicely decorated too, perfect for brunch with a group!"}
{"text":"Vegan chilli fries on fleek everytime & cauliflower tacos & jackfruit sliders. One of my favorite vegan friendly places. I bring my friends here when they visit from out of town."}
{"text":"Glad I gave this place a second chance. The first time it took me half an hour to get my street corn, the second time my huevos came out in a flash. Both were delicious. The atmosphere and space are really chill. Nice place to nurse a beer outside on a warm evening."}
{"text":"Sub-par coffee. Sub-Par Chai. No wifi. Cozy environment. I enjoyed the conversations and atmosphere this establishment provided but I was attempting to do homework and without wifi this wasn't possible."}
{"text":"Creative vegan food with actual flavor unlike many other places. Wonderful tacos - really enjoyed the cauliflower and potato options. How does one fry guacamole -  go to the Coronado to find out in person, you won't be disappointed. The mixed drinks are a great complement to the food - 'The Evergreen' has a 'lil kick to it, just like I like it. Keep rockin it Coronado, we'll be back for more!!"}
{"text":"Lovely brunch options. Highly recommend the veg scrambled tofu and any of the omlettes. I am not familiar with prices around in this part fo phoenix, AZ. I was just passing through AZ so I may be wrong in thinking that it was slightly overpriced. But then I am comparing it to where I have lived in the past - manhattan nyc and California where you find great food at affordable prices.Otherwise the place deserves  a 5 star just for food alone"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  You don't have to be vegan or vegetarian to LIVE everything in the menu.  Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great feel to it as its in a little house off of 7th St.  Very comfortable.  Being an old guest to Braggs, i gotta say I like this place better.  Food and service is great.  Good coffee.  The chorizo tacos(soyrizo) were awesome.  You can tell they care about the food and presentation of it."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time over the weekend with one vegan eater and three meat eaters...everyone agrees the food was AMAZING!!! We each ordered a plate of tacos so we could each try a different kind, if I had to pick a favorite it would be the cauliflower tacos, however they were all great. We also ordered the fried guac... SO DELICIOUS!! I super recommend this place if you are vegan/vegetarian or not.. Also we went mid day and in July, we had to sit outside because seating is very limited inside. They had misters going so the heat was no problem. Check this place out of you get a chance!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Nice guy taking orders and the dishes filled us up until dinner time.  I hope to return."}
{"text":"Great Food, friendly service, nice patio, good cocktail selection.  Try the San Jose sauce - the best!"}
{"text":"Just stumbled upon this little hidden gem last week and the food was so great I went back for 2nd's the next day! Awesome atmosphere as well!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food, beer, liquor and wonderful patio. I love coming here for happy hour (4-7).   I got the red bean quesadilla and Coronado salad. Both were great."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this place. They served me cold biscuits and gravy.  There's no meat on the menu, which would've been ok if the veggie dishes were served hot.  I'm surprised this place is still open.  The Coronado neighborhood deserves a good restaurant in this spot."}
{"text":"Very sweet cafe, great food and coffee, As you can see in the photo, the biscuits are wonderful"}
{"text":"Ten stars would be more appropriate. By far the best Vegan food I've ever had. I am only here a few days visiting. I live in San Diego and wish we had this restaurant there. Everything I tried was amazing, breakfast, lunch, dinner and desserts were incredible! Absolutely love this place. Staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Great place to take non vegetarians to try vegetarian food.  They will see how good this type of food can be.  I tried the fried avocado, cauliflower tacos, and goat cheese quesadilla, plus a brown sugar pop tart pastry.  So good!"}
{"text":"This is the second time that I've been here. Parking is a little rough, and you may have to park down the street.  You offer at a register, get a number, and find a seat. Now down to the business of the food...Both times that I've been here, the food just blows me away! Everything is so fresh and has some serious flavor! The first time I ordered the cauliflower tacos, and they were so tasty and light, yet filling! This time I got the Tepary Bean burger (Not pictured. Sorry, I was hungry!), and was one is the best vegan burgers that I've ever had! The soft bun, and the one big stewed tomato on top is perfection! I will be back here again and again!"}
{"text":"Wow big disappointment. We went here since green was closed. We waited nearly one hour for a sad salad an uninspired tofu scramble. Wait staff was unapologetic. Maybe the desserts are good, but we didn't want to wait around to find out."}
{"text":"This restaurant has really, really good food! I'm a vegan who lives about 5 minutes away and would love to frequent this place for their awesome cuisine, BUT I have been there 5 times now and every. single. time. the staff has been unfriendly and downright rude!! They have never once greeted me upon walking in, even though there's always a girl behind the bar deadpan staring at me. \"Are you who I order from?\" I asked the first time, and she sort of huffed back \"uh, yeah..\".   I resorted to sending my boyfriend in for takeout after about 3 horrible service experiences and every time he's gone in, he comes out in a bad mood from how unkindly he was treated from the staff. He went in the other day just for pastries for my birthday, and after being ignored by Ms. Edgy Barkeep as usual, stood by the pastry case for almost 20 minutes as the guy working it chatted up his friends.   The kids that work here ALL have a holier-than-thou chip on their cold shoulders and are hands-down the worst staff of any place I know. They are there because they look the part and not because they have any competency in service whatsoever. I too am in my early twenties and would never dream of treating customers the way they consistently treat me and everyone I've mistakenly recommended the Coronado to. Yes, the food is good, but I won't send in any more friends to be treated like intruders in an exclusive club for employees and their friends. And I will absolutely never give this place my business again.  I've never met the owner/chef but from his food and their Instagram page he seems like a really nice guy. I just sort of get the sense that he has made it a little too comfortable for the front-of-house employees who have been standing around loudly talking to their friends with profane and unprofessional language and doing nothing productive to service each and every time I've been in. It's a cool place to work, I'm sure, but it's still a job and should be treated that way.  I really want to love this place, and would eat their food all the time, but to be met with such hostility isn't even worth spending 2 minutes inside to pick up takeout."}
{"text":"First I must say, I am not a vegan...nor a vegetarian. I'm the type of gal that appreciates a good cow every once in a while. However, this place makes me contemplate giving up meat for the rest of my life!   Coronado has excellent food and a great atmosphere. The employees are exceptional, too! They were very friendly, welcoming, and helpful when it came to giving recommendations. The Red Bean Quesadillas are exceptional! They are very flavorful and rather filling, too. We also tried the cauliflower tacos and the french fries...both were outstanding! We do plan on going back, especially for the Jalape√±o Waffle and the Goat Cheese Marmalade Quesadilla! Thank you for making vegan food that makes my belly smile :)"}
{"text":"Everything is vegetarian/vegan and everything is tasty, fresh, and creative. Love their dedication to the area and community involvement. They always have good beers on draft and yummy cocktails!"}
{"text":"Price gouging at its finest. I paid $9 for a 5 oz portion of chili and a 8 oz piece of cornbread. As a professionally trained chef their pricing is completely off. With industry standard of maintaining a food cost of under 33% they are saying their food cost are $3 for their chili and cornbread. It's obvious that they are not following industry standards. Why on earth would their be mushrooms in chili. What a major and expensive disappointment"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always drove by it and finally decided to try it out. So cozy inside, wonderful vibe, delicious vegetarian food and great service. The jalapeno jelly-goat cheese quesadillas are awessommeeeee. Same with the sandwiches... And they do Happy Hour I believe 4-7pm daily for drinks and appetizers. Also a perfect place to get some studying/work done with coffee and incredible pastries (they had a Funfetti cake one day....WHOA delicious)."}
{"text":"After just landing in Phoenix, my boyfriend and I (both vegetarians) found this little place on our way to the Grand Canyon. This place is tiny but oh so cute and cozy! We ordered at the counter and then found some seats outside. This is a great spot to hang out and relax for a nice meal, a good coffee, or even just a small bite.  We ordered the black coffee chili & cornbread and the potato tacos. The tacos were decent and we devoured them pretty fast, but the chili was so cold! The chili was literally near frozen in the center. We told someone immediately, and she apologized and brought us a new one right away. Unfortunately, this one was almost just as cold. The chili really was delicious though and we were pretty hungry, and so we decided not to say anything this second time and just \"eat around the cold part.\"  To our surprise, a few moments later, the young woman that gave us the second chili presented us with a receipt refunding not just the chili but OUR ENTIRE ORDER! She also apologized to us again and thanked us for stopping by. During our visit, this place was just working out the kinks, since they were still quite new. The food itself was creative and delicious, and the customer service was impeccable!  We still ordered some coffees to go, because we just couldn't leave without spending a penny in such a friendly place!"}
{"text":"This is the worst meal I've ever paid for.  The hash was boiled potatoes, the breakfast sandwich is on a disgusting biscuit, the Bloody Mary was basically straight tomato juice, and the fried guac was inedible. I live down the street and I wouldn't go back if they paid me.  You have to pay up front, otherwise I wouldn't have."}
{"text":"The Coronado is a lovely and cozy institution. I placed my order and the girl was pretty rude, but whatever. I'm guessing it was the end of her shift/ the food and friendly server afterward made up for it. The focaccia is so great, perfect texture and compliments their tortas quite nicely. I could eat the bread by itself!   Try the coffee"}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been coming here since it opened back in the day so I have always had a soft spot for this place! Not fond of The Vine though. But the new place is great! Yes it has Vegan food! But delicious VEGAN FOOD!! So far I have had the Calabacitas Burrito, lots of good fresh veggies in a yummy tortilla! I did let them know I would prefer if the veggies were cut up smaller. The lady who I told was so nice about listening to me. I have also had the Goat Cheese Quesadilla not my favorite, I love Goat Cheese but it was just too much for me. The Jalapeno Marmalade was excellent though! My absolute favorite is the Black Coffee Chili and Cornbread!!! The Chili is full of yummy beans corn and lots of other veggies! But the spice is PERFECT! It has a nice kick to it! And the Cornbread is outstanding! Who knew Vegan butter was so good! I also love their breakfast and coffee! Now the bakery items are in a category in there own! Everything is displayed by the coffee bar and EVERYTHING is delicious and addicting! I have had the cookies and a Chocolate Cherry Scone! Both are out of this world good! This place is literally steps away from my desk at work so it is very dangerous!! Please give The Coronado a chance! Great friendly people who really care about the food and drinks they are serving! My only complaint is.. I wish they would decorate for Halloween! That old house is perfect for Halloween..my favorite holiday! ;)"}
{"text":"This was our (me and my wife) first time eating a Vegan restaurant and we were extremely pleased with all the flavors in our food. My wife had the potato taco and I had the cauliflower tacos. We also had the fried guacamole. All of our food was DELICIOUS!!! Its a quirky place thats run out of a refurbished house. Its very quaint and I highly recommend it for vegans and Non vegans."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! I went there on a weekday evening when there was no one else in there, so I can't speak for weekends. The atmosphere was awesome and had that classic downtown Phoenix vibe in an old converted house, though it was a bit confusing on where to go when I first walked in. The owner and other employees were very nice as well. My boyfriend and I ordered the fried guacamole (on happy hour) and the red potato and gazpacho burger with the brown sugar lemonade. Everything was delicious, including the fries, the house made ketchup, and the other amazing house made sauces. Reasonably priced for fresh, delicious vegan/vegetarian food, and it looked like they had great coffee drinks although we didn't try any. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"I think this place has a great vibe, and the menu certainly looks good but unfortunately I did not enjoy the food. This may be better for dining in, however i ordered potato tacos and the goat cheese & jalape√±o marmalade quesadillas to go. Unfortunately none of it went over well. There were three tacos in the order - there was a lot of sauce on one, and barely any on the other two. The potatoes were really overcooked, dry and salty. The quesadilla was a bit better, but still the jalape√±o marmalade was way too sweet without the kick of heat needed to balance it out.  On a more positive note, their bakery treats were nice, I ordered a caramel, rosemary and chocolate chip cookie, along with a blood orange pound cake and both were good."}
{"text":"Great veggie options made with real stuff vs. fake meat.  We loved the cauliflower tacos - was so reminscent of the texture of fish tacos.  Flawless execution on the cauliflower preparation, but would have loved a bigger dab of their homemade guac.  The beet burger was a winner too, particularly when paired with the buttermilk bun, though a slightly thicker patty would have left me more satisfied.  It's a casual \"hipster\" joint, and service is quick with counter-service.  Outdoor patio seating is offered, though sadly a few smokers decided it appropriate to dirty up the open air."}
{"text":"I just moved to Phoenix from Chicago where I, a vegetarian of many years flirting with being a vegan, had a plethora of veg options. I've already been here twice in this first month. The food is delicious and well presented. The food flavors are different from what I've seen and all have been delicious. That includes the drinks, bakery items, and menu items. Genuinely excited to go back. Happy this is in Phoenix. Very cool and comfortable atmosphere. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Their deep fried guac is amazing ! And I love that they have a dog friendly patio great choice for vegetarians and meat eaters alike"}
{"text":"When searching for Vegan food...it's not an easy feat to find something this GOOD! This was my 2nd time here..and I had the cauliflower tacos and also splurged with the fried guacamole.. Both were good, but the Tacos were excellent! Wish I could have had room for dessert..it looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Food 5 stars for sure ( I will go into more detail in a minute) 4 stars for service- when ordering I felt rushed. I have never been to this restaurant before and I had questions that I didn't get to ask. My husband and I wanted to try a couple of different items since we didn't know when we would be in the area again, but every time we were cut off and she was giving us our total. At one point I asked her to hold on that I wanted to order more. The other reason for the 4 stars is space. This place is TINY and you have to keep walking around hoping someone gets up and you can get a place to sit. We finally found a seat and then came the food :-) I ordered the cauliflower tacos which were delicious! My husband had the red potato and garbanzo bean burger which was also really good. He loved the fresh cut fries and couldn't stop talking about how good the ketchup was. I had to try the burger and  we both agreed that it was probably one of the best vegan burgers we have had. Next, we tried the fried guacamole. I know that there are great reviews about the guacamole ( that's why we tried it) but we didn't care for it and I LOVE guacamole. The guacamole was lacking in flavor. The fresh made tortilla chips were over cooked. We would not order that dish again. The menu had lots of other items that sounded yummy so we will be back. Oh, I forgot to mention the weird pictures of people that hang in the bathroom. You have to check them out!"}
{"text":"Quaint house turned restaurant is the perfect place for a casual, intimate meal with friends. Even non-vegan/vegetarians love it.  Fried cauliflower tacos?  Yes please!!!  Breakfast scramble burrito with tofu?  Mmmmmm.  Flavors you'll remember!  You'll be hard pressed to find a friendlier staff anywhere."}
{"text":"Stopped here while staying in PHX and loved it! Centrally located, adorable spot with a huge dog-friendly patio.   I got the potato tacos and one of their signature cocktails, The Sheridan. The tortillas were homemade and the cabbage was crisp and fresh.  I would HIGHLY recommend you check out this place. Whether you're vegetarian or not."}
{"text":"The food is awesome! We had the cauliflower tacos and jalape√±o marmalade and goat cheese quesadillas. The service is quick and friendly. The patio and parking are spacious but one star taken away because they only have three or four tables that can seat more than two people. That was by far the only thing remotely wrong with this spot though. Please go and support local as well as try something off of their highly creative menu!!!"}
{"text":"Randomly ended up here because my friend wanted a beer. Since I wasn't drinking alcohol, I ordered the lemonade. So my review is solely on the lemonade. It was delicious. Very refreshing. Totally quenched my thirst!!! Highly recommend it :)"}
{"text":"The amazing food and friendly atmosphere keeps us coming back!! My hubby is vegetarian and we love how we can choose anything off the menu for the both of us and it tastes delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice, and I am by far not a Vegan or Vegetarian. The first time I visited the establishment was with my girlfriend and a group of friends for their \"Simpsons\" trivia night. We had a large group and the place was packed with a lot of people so the service looked a little flustered, constantly running around trying to figure out where orders were going. The man at the counter didn't know what a whiskey sour was, but his female counterpart made what my girlfriend calls \"THE BEST IN THE WORLD\" I tried the red bean quesadilla that night and really enjoyed it while my girlfriend had the street corn, and we split a hummus platter. I was a little confused by getting a full parsnip, and jalapeno as part of the vegies on the platter (girlfriend doesn't like spicy foods, I love them) but the hummus was good and overall the food and drinks were good. Came back about a month later for another \"Simpsons\" Trivia night and the girl friend and I were alone this time. Again, full kudos to the woman behind the whiskey sour ^_^ The girlfriend constantly gushed over how amazing the vegan pastries are, and I finally got to try the Vegan Poptarts, this one had apple cinnamon and I should have bought more I took one bite and instantly wanted more. Also, got to try the Pistachio sandwich pastry that was so good my girlfriend handed out a piece to a customer just to share how good it was. We ordered the Biscuit and Gravy, and I got the breakfast burrito with tofu instead of egg. It was a amazing night, with more good food and good people.  Today is 3/2/17 and I cant wait to go back, I'm thinking I need breakfast on Saturday there ^_^"}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because I haven't tried a lot of their food! I will be fixing that quickly and adjusting my review accordingly!  But their potato tacos. You guys. Oh my goodness. I'm not even a vegetarian but I could eat these dang potato tacos on the daily. I also paired it with a prickly pear iced tea and it was super refreshing.   Service was friendly as well, so I will of course be back to this spot!"}
{"text":"The wife and I have been coming here for the past year and half and have enjoyed every minute of it. The food is deliciously good. Personally recommend the Potato Tacos. Those things are so damn tasty!! The place isn't over priced either. Also has awesome friendly staff!  All in all great food, great people and a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed that our experience was so different from the other reviews.   Entrance:  we walked around the location trying to figure out the deal...do we seat ourselves?...is their table or counter service...???  I had to find one of the three people working there to find out if we seated ourselves or what.  I was informed \"Oh, this is counter service only.\"  Cool.  I'll find my own seat.  Found a table in the nice warmth of the patio but it was full of the prior customers' rubbish....plates, glasses, food, silverware.  We sat there and looked at the menus, thinking someone would come along to clean off the little table were seated at.  I went in and placed our orders and we just wanted waters.  No offer of glasses so I again had to search for SOMETHING to drink out of.  I apparently snatched the \"pay\" cups, but crap, no help to figure this out!  Oh well.  Back to the table.  The rubbish still there.  So I cleaned everything off and put the stuff in trash and bins.  Obviously there was no post-customer wipe up of the table despite my cleaning it off.  At this point. I'm wondering why in the H**L I left a tip.  I'M DOING ALL THE DAMN WORK.  *sigh*  Moving on.  Food:  The food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  I ordered the grilled vegetable sandwich on FOCACCIA bread but it was served on hard ass sour dough bread that could not be bitten in to because it was so hard.  Also, the veggies were yellow squash and I think butternut.  The veggies were cold and greasy with just the grill marks like it was dragged across the grill.  There was ZERO flavor.  I broke up the sandwich because the bread was so hard and was going to eat it like a salad.  The butternut squash was RAW AND HARD.  Unbelievably hard.  Salt and cholula were the saviors of this ridiculous entree.  It was disappointing.  My husband ordered the FRESH BAKED biscuits and gravy.  I'm not sure if this entree is supposed to be served COLD .  COLDCOLDCOLD.  And congealed.  The biscuits were so hard they \"thunked\" when you tapped them with the fork.  The inside of the biscuits were edible but that was hard satisfying when the gravy was just gross.   We were invisible.  No staff spoke to us, greeted us or thanked us.  And I fricken' tipped!  WTH???  Do yourself a favor and skip right on across the street to GREEN RESTAURANT and NAMI.  You will be thrilled with the service, food, accurate order and did I say service?  No THAT'S worth the tip.    Geez.  I have to go back because I was so confident this would be my awesome vegan dining experience, I bought TWO certificates to this place and I'm not one to waste.  If my next experience improves, I will update this review.  Sad.  Gross and I was still hungry when I left, but I DID clean my table."}
{"text":"Great quality and flavors with a nice mix of comfort food and healthy options. The staff is great. Service was fast."}
{"text":"From the minute I walked in I loved, loved, loved this place! I checked it out because I had a groupon and will definitely be back. It's an adorable old home converted into a cafe/bar/restaurant. There are misters outside and a great patio that was actually cool (it's mid August). Inside we were immediately greeted by a friendly barista that gave us the ins and outs. I ordered the cauliflower tacos (they came highly recommended), my boyfriend got the chorizo tacos (made with tofu) and we split a side of fries. Everything was DELICIOUS!!! Bonus they have a fantastic game selection (Guess Who, Clue, Jersey Shore puzzle). It was a place I could easily spend all day. There was only one drawback- they have a great beer selection (if you like IPAs), but the beer wasn't super cold. I was probably the first to order one (it was 11:30AM), but I am a girl that likes an ice cold brew. Other than that it was a totally amazing experience!!"}
{"text":"The potato and cauliflower tacos were great! The cauliflower was amazing and the sauces on both tacos were amazing. Didn't get a chance to try anything else. The one complaint with the tacos were the tortillas, they really took away from the otherwise amazing ingredients.      **The reason I'm giving this place 3 stars though is because of the pictures in the bathroom. They were almost demonic. They gave me a really weird feeling and completely took away from the entire experience. I may be exaggerating but they almost made me afraid to stay in there. I wonder if they are the owners pictures or were there from the previous owners of the house. Either way I really question WHY they are there.**      *Great food, pictures made for a very bad vibe.*"}
{"text":"Very impressive staff ,I questioned the amount of organic ingredients they were working with, the answer was beautiful their doing great in that area right down to the spices ! My daughter and I had a gluten-free vegan organic lunch it was beautiful. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Vegan breakfast is so hard to find and they do it so well. I had the breakfast sandwich and a cold brew coffee before my flight out of Phoenix. It is very close to the airport, so it's a great place to stop on the way."}
{"text":"Love this place! It looks like a little house which is awesome! They have boardgames you can play while you eat your food and a little tucked away area if you want a quiet space to study. I got the vegan buscuits and gravy, soooo goooood. My boyfriend got the chorizo tacos with tofu which he really enjoyed and came with a very flavorful sauce. Desserts look amazing, haven't tried but definitely will in the future! Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Met a good friend here for lunch at her suggestion -- we try to go places we have not been and this was her pick and I am glad she did.  Cute old house converted to a restaurant in the historic Coronado district with inside and outside seating with misters. You order at the bar and pick out where you want to sit.  Menu is small but great offerings - cheap prices for what you get. Had cauliflower tacos & street corn which was more than enough and very tasty.  Ordered a drink - the Edgemont -- nice light and tasty.  We sat and talked for 2 hours and no one bothered us other than to remove or dishes and ask if there was anything we needed.  Great little vegan place that will definitely be going on the monthly rotation!"}
{"text":"Easily a 5-Star experience. The menu items have an obvious thoughtfulness behind them. Adding The Coronado to my very short, but ever increasing, list of Phoenix gems. Don't miss out ;)"}
{"text":"Missed breakfast at Nami and recommended to come here. They serve breakfast ALL DAY! My friend had avocado toast which she loved and I had the  vegan good morning breakfast sandwich which was delicious. As a table we decided to split an order of the biscuits and gravy because I have to try it wherever I go. Soooo much food, but soooo good! We could have got a half order of the biscuits and gravy and shared just one because their biscuits are pretty big. Loved that they were nice and soft and the mushroom gravy mmmm good. Overall, everything was great from the food to the friendly staff. If I wasn't visiting from out of town, I'd definitely be back to try more from this place."}
{"text":"This place is adorable and delicious! All of our dishes were bursting with flavor and the evergreen cocktail is a must! Great service and atmosphere- we will definitely be making this gem a frequent place to eat."}
{"text":"Great food! Awesome historic house turned restaurant! My vegan daughter took us here for a wonderful lunch including their fantastic coffee! We all split their cookie (like an Oreo) for dessert. The staff was knowledgeable about the food and the menu offered a huge variety. Don't miss the tacos!! They were amazing. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came to check out this spot after all of the reviews and sadly, I was unimpressed. The food was overpriced for how bland it was. The portions were smaller than I'm used to, and I didn't even finish my food because of how bland everything tasted. I ordered the chili and guacamole fries. I also tasted the cauliflower tacos and the market vegetable scramble with tofu. Not a lot of places have managed to master a tofu scramble so I didn't expect much from it, but I did expect the cauliflower tacos to taste a lot better. The chili guacamole fries were super dry. The fries seemed like they were sitting out for a bit because they were super dry and the only thing that made them seem warm was the chili on top of it. The best thing I had their was the iced jasmine green tea. The tea was really flavorful. Needless to say I spent $30+ for mine and my BF food and I left hungry and disappointed. I normally expect to pay more for vegan food, but it's usually because it is full of flavor and variety. This place reminded me why people think vegan food is tasteless. There are definitely better vegan spots out there. The I would give the food 1 star, but the set up of this place 4 stars because it is really cute and quaint. The tea easily gets 5 stars! Probably won't be back unless I want some more tea."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a vegan/vegetarian restaurant so good it could make  republicans question their life choices, then this is it. With excellent food, coffee, and an outstanding local craft beer selection The Coronado does not disappoint."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite restaurant in Phoenix.   The first time I visited I was a little bit discouraged because I was on a time crunch and ordered 2 cauliflower tacos to go. There was only one order in front of us but our order still took 45 minutes to be prepared! It was infuriating. However, the lovely people behind the counter apologized and said they were very understaffed and refunded our card for our wait time. Very lovely.  So by the time I returned, I was fully prepared for a higher wait time but deemed those delicious tacos well worth it and braved their very busy Friday night. I ordered the same cauliflower tacos with  2local beers and a fried guacamole. I found a seat outside on the welcoming patio and settled in for my wait. 5 minutes later my food was on the table. Bravo! That fried guac? Holy guacamole! Yum! Just the atmosphere, the explosively delicious food and the appropriate pricing makes this place just phenomenal. I was very happy with the improved speed of service and retract my previous apprehension toward the place.  So delicious. So impressive. So happy to have somewhere I can enjoy vegan and vegetarian food that my meat eating boyfriend can also enjoy.  He even said to me that he had no idea now much he could love a vegan restaurant.  I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants good food, good atmosphere and good people to be around.   The only negative points I have are that, being in a small building downtown, it gets a little crowded inside the there's not enough space for the line to grow when you're waiting to order. I would love to see this place grow and expand and just keep blowing me out of the water."}
{"text":"Excellent Vegan food! They have a small but diverse menu that is mexican inspired and so flavorful! Not only is the food fantastic but they have a great craft brews and wine.   It was so nice that we sat outside on the porch of the older house that The Coronado is located in. The street noise from N 7th St was a bit overpowering but we happened to be there during rush hour.   Overall, definitely a place to go even if one isn't vegan!"}
{"text":"I like this place but I think it's a little overpriced. The menu is very small so if you want lots of options it's not a good place to go. I got their breakfast burrito with tofu (instead of egg) and the flavors were amazing. It came with a sauce on the side that was really tasty too. I would recommend this place for people who are vegan especially because all of their food items including their baked goods are (or can be) vegan."}
{"text":"Great little place decided to check them out after tasting there vegan meringue at the Sips and sweets event. We are not vegan or vegetarian but have been try some of there foods after my wife has developed a sensitive stomach. The drinks and beer were very good not a large selection of beers on tap but the ones they do are too shelf. The drink menu was top shelf to made with premium liquor. We had the red bean quesadilla and the Fried guacamole both were very tasty. We will be back some time soon."}
{"text":"Everything was so good, coffee, food, service, music, environment. My daughter had a biscuit with jam and the jam tasted homemade, not sure if it is, but either way delicious."}
{"text":"Right off the bat...too vegan .  However the food is good and original.  Coffee chili avocado fries were pretty good with big French fries and a fairly large scoop of avocado.  The goat cheese quesadilla had just the right amount of sweet to spicy.  I didn't like the evergreen drink but they accidentally brought us a Moscow mule so they let me switch mine out.  It was a bit too gingery but still good.  The evergreen was too spicy.  The chocolate cherry muffin was good.  They don't have decaf coffee but they do have decaf tea so that was nice.  Staff was friendly and the patio seating was nice."}
{"text":"New spot that I have been chomping at the bit to try!  I absolutely love Bragg's, so it's no surprise that I am already in love with The Coronado.  Liam and Emily have done it again, folks!    Super cute decor, lots of little spots to sit in and outside.  They have locally roasted coffee from Xanadu (which I'm currently sipping on and loving), tasty house-made pastries (I got a vegan cherry chocolate scone...and then I got one more for the road, sooooo good!), breakfast and lunch items, beer and rootbeer on tap, house cocktails, etc.  This place has something for everyone and I cannot wait to go back and try it all!!"}
{"text":"We came here when the parking at Greens New Veg was full and we were too lazy to park across the busy street and run for our lives.  What a pleasant and delicious surprise.  The service is wonderful, the atmosphere is indefinable, but lovely.  My waffle was unforgettable and so was my husbands.  We will definitely return"}
{"text":"We were in town for a few days and came here on a recommendation- so glad we did. This is the kind of place I really love: great food and drink but  completely unpretentious. Very comfortable space. I am now addicted to grilled corn with mayo and Mexican cheese. Watch out Rick Bayless."}
{"text":"Love this place! My new go-to study place. It's quaint and has a fun menu. Patio is really inviting and the service was super friendly."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I've finally found a place that is vegan/vegetarian friendly! I had the horchatte and cauliflower tacos! Try the cauli tacos! You won't be disappointed. It was all delicious. Staff was nice and the ambiance is just right."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend for the first time because of a Groupon, we tried the potato tacos and biscuits and gravy. The tacos are AMAZING we already have a plan to go back for them again. The biscuits and gravy are good but have onions and mushrooms and I dont like either but they still have a good flavor albeit not traditional.  The girl at the counter, Amy, was really friendly and helpful!   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The jalepe√±o waffle here is the perfect vehicle for syrup! Would recommend to people who like eating at good restaurants."}
{"text":"5 stars!!!! I have been a vegetarian for 10 years and love trying out new vegetarian/vegan restaurants. I was on a break from work and decided to bring my husband & coworker with me (both are not vegetarian) and they loved this restaurant. We had the cauliflower tacos & a funfetti cookie sandwich and were so impressed. We will definitely be back to visit. Also 5 stars for the service. I wish I could remember the nice gentlemen's name that took our order but he was very kind and helpful. Thanks so much!! P.S. so excited they are dog friendly I could bring my dog on the outside patio!"}
{"text":"Meh, everything had a sticky sauce. No *fake* meat here which is good. I have several vegan friends so I guess this is a cute place to take them. If I went here again I would probably just get two plates of fried guacamole, definitely the best thing on the menu. I like that you can order drinks here."}
{"text":"My favorite vegan spot in town! I always get the cauliflower tacos with fresh cut French fries. They are the shizz! The iced soy lavender latte is reason enough to come back, it's super smooth and not so sweet. I've also tried the corn on the Cobb during happy hour for half off, I'm not sure what time it was again. They have vegan pastries as well."}
{"text":"It's a nice little spot with good music and fine coffee, though a bit pricey. I spilled my cappuccino and the barista was kind enough to notice and offered to make me another drink for free.    The only thing I would improve would be the lack of outlets, especially outdoors. I know there's only so much that can done to rewire these spaces, so just come here with a full battery."}
{"text":"If I won the lottery, the first thing I would do is come here and order one of everything off the menu. I want to eat everything they create here. Their chocolate chip rosemary cookies are just chewy enough while still remaining their integrity. The orange scones crumble to perfection. The goat cheese quesadilla is one of the best quesadillas I've ever had, and it comes with a jalape√±o marmalade that I would totally buy a jar of if they sold it. The interior is cool and hip, they've got assorted house plants growing in every corner. Come early for good seating and parking. Stay late because you won't want to leave this place."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic! Almost everything is 100% vegan or can be substituted. The woman at the front counter was friendly and made some amazing bloody Mary's. Will definitely be returning soon!!"}
{"text":"+chia pudding -tables at outdoor dining area +beet burger"}
{"text":"We saw this place on the program Check Please AZ and decided to give it a try and we have not been disappointed. We have gone back a few times and the food has been delicious every time....."}
{"text":"Food is awesome! Very nice people. I haven't eaten anything that doesn't taste bad. My wife also loves it and has nothing bad to say. A lot of people I know don't know about this place and it's sad. They deserve to know about this place!"}
{"text":"I am new to vegan eating and this place definitely gave me a five star  introduction to deliciously well prepared dishes. I haven't had the opportunity to dine in but, I'm planning to very soon. Twice now I've ordered take out and each time the process was simple, quick and friendly. First, I tried the chorizo tacos which were hands down extremely comparable to the real thing. I didn't even think twice about having real eggs or beef chorizo. You can tell the cooks take great care to pay attention to details. The grilled corn tortillas added an extra touch. Next up I decided to give a burger a try. The garbanzo, red potato burger will not disappoint you as it provides a well melded combination of perfectly seasoned ingredients that will keep you from ever missing an all beef patty. The dish is served with your choice of French fries or a salad and not just your run of the mills salads an arugula based salad with cherry tomatoes and a balsamic dressing. Each dish I ordered shows the great care taken to provide not only we'll prepared food but, an artistic flare to simple yet wholesome bites that will keep me coming back for more."}
{"text":"I am sitting on the front porch of The Coronado as I write this review. This is my second visit. The trees and rafters are still dripping from a fresh rain. (It rained last time I was here, too.)  I like this place - the charm of it. There is plenty of seating, both inside and out, and the interior features some really cool artwork, too. The bar is small but clean, and well-stocked for the size.  The first time I visited, my friend and I ordered food: the chili/cornbread and the potato tacos. Both dishes were very dry. We were not impressed, but we enjoyed our time here anyway.  There was also a small mishap with the coffee filters last time... I ordered a pour-over and, after nearly 30 minutes of waiting, was told that the filters kept breaking so I wouldn't be getting any hot coffee that night. Very strange. I had them bring me a tea instead.  This time, I have ordered the root beer they have on tap (a GENIUS addition to the menu, in my humble opinion). It is very tasty. I would order it again for sure.  Despite the subpar dishes (to my taste) and the unusual case of defective filters, I can't help but like this place. It has all the elements one might expect of a small neighborhood cafe.  The staff has always been super friendly, too, which counts for a lot in my book. The Coronado is a new addition to the area - I think it will do well. If you've never been, stop by for a root beer! If you want it to rain, just sit on the front porch - it's worked for me every time!  ;)"}
{"text":"We really liked what we had...huevos rancheros, potato tacos, and a salad.    Ambiance is pretty cool.  We were a little bummed that they were out of a couple signature items.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to trying this place and wasn't disappointed. The food was excellent. However, while the food was good, it was definitely not a healthy alternative. Coronado makes your feel morally sound but your waistline is not done any favors."}
{"text":"Took my vegetarian daughter and rest of our family (all non vegetarians) and we all loved it. Delicious food, beautiful presentation, fresh ingredients, friendly staff. Also, The Coronado is just a lovely setting. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Vegans and omnis, do yourself a favor and eat here. The Coronado is a great place to introduce vegan/vegetarian food to your non-veg family and friends, as everything can be made vegan or vegetarian, so they can ease into the foods they're more familiar with (e.g. choice of eggs or tofu, cotija cheese or vegan cheese). It's counter service, so if it's your first time, it's not clear if you order right away or take a seat, but the employees are friendly and seem to recognize right away if you need a little guidance. Every time I come back, I always try a new pastry (particularly a new vegan pop tart) and new entree and I've never been disappointed. Plus, I love that The Coronado doesn't rely on mock meats as a restaurant. While I'm definitely not one to shy away from mock meats, it feels like a more impressive and wholesome dining experience having food THAT good and not needing some version of mock chicken, beef, etc. I guarantee you'll find something you like, whether you swing by for a pastry and coffee or tacos during happy hour."}
{"text":"First timer here! I was so pleasantly surprised and impressed. The restaurant is located in a quaint house with limited parking. The staff all had smiles on their faces and patiently waited as I debated for several minutes. I ended up getting the breakfast burrito with tofu. 10/10 for taste! I'll be coming back plenty of times until I try all the vegan options! I would recommend only groups of 4 or less, it's a very cozy and snug spot. Also, they have pastries, coffee, and cocktails, so you can come any time of the day!"}
{"text":"My inlaws just went vegetarian and maybe vegan and we came here after my son basketball game. This place was pretty full but parking was not horrible. I enjoyed it I have the guacamole fries they were so good my hubby got a chorizo taco which tasted just as good. Definitely gonna come back"}
{"text":"This was my first vegan restaurant experience in Phoenix and I loved the vibe here. Lots of greenery and succulents, dog-friendly patio, friendly staff, and plenty of seating options.  You do order your own food art the main counter rather than getting your order taken like at a normal sit down restaurant - but the waitress at the front told us that right up front so it wasn't a big deal at all.   *Disclaimer: I do have food allergies to dairy and soy.* I didn't have any reactions from the food listed below.  My friend and I both ordered the avocado toast. I opted to get mine without the tomatoes and we both thought our orders tasted great! My friend also ordered a hazelnut pastry and thought it a little dry but it was good.  I will definitely be back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"As a Coronado resident, I appreciate how this renewed space treats its neighbors: free cup of coffee. (They couponed my door earlier this week.)  Today, though, I paid for my scone and macchiato since I'd left the coupon at home. Totally worth it. The espresso is up there with Giant. And the dark chocolate and cherry scone was appropriately sized, not a big box bakery Goliath. Perhaps too much raw sugar on top. I brushed a bit off.   The space offers a better feel than Coronado Cafe and Urban Vine (terrible name) did. Decor is Lux meets Cartel,  and the wood floor homifies it warmly.   Though no demitasse cups yet, the super-friendly and accommodating barista offered me the macchiato in a tiny glass jar. Worked for me.   $2 off signature cocktails during happy hour. A very intriguing lunch and dinner menu with nearly all entries vegan. Can't wait to go for weekend breakfast.   Welcome to the neighborhood.   UPDATE: Finally had lunch here. Just awesome. The server brought us some gratis potato tacos. Savory and delicious, but the double corn tortilla likely unnecessary. One will do.   I had the Monte Vista torta and the standout components were the salty zucchini and buoyant focaccia. A bit pricey at $11 but a solid lunch.   We had the back room for five of us. A bit echoey but cozy and private.   Can't wait to try the cocktails."}
{"text":"This is a non meat eaters dream and a charming addition to the historic district. So far for my visits. I've tried the red potato garbanzo burger, the chili guac fries, goat cheese marmalade quesadilla, veggie scramble, and the jackfruit sliders. The food is fresh, creative, delicious and satisfying. The staff is extremely sweet and seem passionate about the restaurant. It's worth a visit for breakfast (any time of the day) lunch, dinner, or for happy hour!"}
{"text":"The food is original and delicious. The vibe inside is super chill and they did an awesome job decorating! And the patio rules."}
{"text":"Don't get out for breakfast very often so was super excited to see a vegetarian menu with a 4.5 star review. What a disappointment! The environment was great and the service was good (the only reason I gave them any stars) but the food and coffee were terrible. We ordered the beet burger which was fresh but utterly flavorless; the biscuits and gravy lacked not only spice but just salt and the biscuits were hard and cold; and the chorizo tacos had beautiful presentation but were tiny and again lacking any flavor. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Really way overrated. The food is not great, prices are high, service is spotty, parking is awful and it's very small and not particularly warm inside. I just don't get all the good reviews. As a vegan, I so wanted this to be a good place. Sorry but all the hip indie music that they play in the background still can't put lipstick on this pig."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best vegan food I have had in a very long time! We thoroughly enjoyed the delicious treats!"}
{"text":"Since recently becoming vegan, I've been checking several places to eat. This was my first official vegan...SOOOO yummy!! The cauliflower tacos...amazing! The bean burger...amazing!! Wasn't quit as impressed with the quesadilla or fried guacamole...but still very good!! Have been back a couple times more...their cookies are delish too!!! Wish this place was closer to old town scottsdale!"}
{"text":"This is a great vegan/vegetarian restaurant option, something that is sometimes hard to come by. To drink I got The Edgemont, which I recommend! I love cocktails with basil and this one was done right. I ordered the fried guacamole and chorizo tacos with tofu. The food was presented really nicely and tasted good. It didn't blow my mind, but I really liked the sauces they used on everything. They were just the right amount of spicy without setting my mouth on fire. I thought the tofu could have used some seasoning/salt. The service, however, did blow me away! They were so nice and accommodating and brought me silverware and drinks even though this is something that you self serve. The patio was really nice and I would have sat out there if it had been warmer. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to bring out-of-town visitors for some great vegan and vegetarian food. I have tried both of the quesadillas and they are good. My favorite item is definitely the cauliflower tacos, they are delicious! I also like the potato tacos and the fried avocado. The nice thing about this place is that they also have drinks and they will serve them with vodka instead of gin if that is what you like. I have a hard time leaving this place without getting a vegan baked good. The Blondie is amazing and I love the rosemary chocolate chip cookies. It is so nice to sit out on the patio, hang out and have some great food here."}
{"text":"Got to try the fried guac! I'm not vegan or vegetarian and I enjoyed the food an drink a lot. Great food and great service. All items can be made vegan friendly!"}
{"text":"I've had their food three times and been underwhelmed twice, particularly for the price. (The biscuits and gravy were good but a small portion for the price and simplicity). The food is generally mediocre and the service is slow. Pretty bland. It's possibly impressive if you're veg or vegan, idk. I would maybe go back for coffee or drinks - it is a very cute place, but not a stop for omnivores who enjoy exploring restaurants. Go to Green."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at The Coronado on May 27, 2017 while traveling across the country.  We had the cauliflower tacos, avocado toast, biscuits and gravy with tofu scramble on the side.  The overall meal was good.  I always enjoy a restaurant doing something with cauliflower and I recommend the avocado toast.  Even though it sounds plain, the quality of the bread complimented the dish.   Sadly, due to their public anti-law enforcement stances against Phoenix hiring more police officers and their ignorant views of how police are hurting their community; I can not support their establishment.  Phoenix PD is 1,200 officers short for a city of that size and emergency calls can take up to 15 minutes for law enforcement to respond.  The owners Emily and Liam's anti-police stance are so strong they went to a city hearing to oppose any hiring of police officers and make statements of how law enforcement \"hurts\" the community.  Up until these public statements, my wife and I were planning to go back during our next trip in June.  Now, I am not going to return.  The owners did not know it at the time, but I am a law enforcement officer.  This knowledge of their anti-police views effected my remembrance of my experience there.  So, I am giving two stars for the food and knowing my hard earned money went to help a place that does not welcome law enforcement, which means I was not welcome there.   I hope Yelp keeps my review.  I am an actual customer of this restaurant and their anti-police stances effected my experience of eating there.  Yelp allows other reviews that go beyond the quality of food and this review is no different than other criticisms for cleanliness, decor, and attitude of the servers/owner.  My review is no different.  Since the owners wanted make public their negative views about members of their community  (law enforcement), that should be taken in consideration when making my review of my experience there.  I would have never went to the place if I known I am not welcome. I wished I never gave money to them."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and I am not even vegetarian! Also super yummy pastries and drinks. This plane is decorated with eclectic furniture and art while maintaining the charm of the original home. Thank you so much for the hospitality!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burrito I've ever had, vegan or otherwise. Next time I'm in Phoenix, I'm going to make sure I go out of my way to stop here again!"}
{"text":"A vegetarian restaurant that hosts Simpsons trivia sounds like something out of my dream journal. Unfortunately, the food needs some work.  My first visit was the best, and the next two went downhill. On my first visit, my dad and I shared the cauliflower tacos and red bean quesadilla. It was happy hour so he got a beer that he loved, and I had a nice prickly pear tequila cocktail. The tacos have been the best thing that I've tried on the menu. They came with a very spicy sauce that my dad and I loved.  The next visit was with my husband during Simpsons trivia. The event was fun although I was a little exasperated that they doubled booked a poetry reading at the same time that delayed our start. My husband enjoyed a couple cocktails, and we ordered the chili fries, jackfruit sliders and chorizo tacos. My husband liked his tacos; I thought the jackfruit sliders were ok but had way too much bun. The chili fries were cold and not that good.  My last visit was during lunch. I decided to take advantage of the all day breakfast and got the biscuits and gravy with an egg. The biscuits were awful. So hard and bland. The mushroom gravy was too sweet, and the whole dish was too cold. I also got a mexican chocolate cookie that I only ate half of. I've made better in my own kitchen.  If I'm in the area, I'll stick with Green."}
{"text":"I love that this place opened up and is giving Green a run for its money!  It's completely different than Bragg's (same owner).  Staff is super friendly and patient. The place itself is in a converted historic home so it literally has that \"homey\" feel. The best things on the menu (and I've tried nearly everything) are the cauliflower tacos, potato tacos (hold the cheese) and deep fried Guac.  The jackfruit sliders could definitely use some work but otherwise you will be happy dining here! Ask for San Jose salsa for extra flavor and spice.  I only wish that this was the type of restaurant where you are seated and your order is taken at your table because it can get tight at the bar.  Huge plus for long hours everyday from about 6 am to 10 or 11 p.m.!"}
{"text":"Wow. Love this place so much. Have only been twice but i can't wait to come back again super soon. Some of the best vegan food i have had in phoenix so far. The cauliflower tacos taste just like crispy fish tacos and they are so delicious. They have a variety of vegan pastries and a beautiful outdoor seating patio."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and i have been coming here since they opened. Amazing vibe and nice outside patio where we can bring our dog. One of the few restaurants that presents food exactly as it looks on the website. Stoked that new menu options are coming tomorrow. They also serve Xanadu coffee which is ."}
{"text":"Whoever is on the cutting board today, I need y'all to focus! Just spit out an ENTIRE clove of garlic from my Red bean quesadillas. I don't even remember reading garlic in the ingredients but I sure got a mouth full. Apart from my breath being ruined for the rest of the day (brushing ain't helping this lol), I'd say the meal was pretty good. The quesadillas were ok but the cauliflower tacos were great!"}
{"text":"The cauliflower tacos are A plus! Light, fresh, and tasty! Great atmosphere and awesome service!"}
{"text":"The food is great!  I got the Huss Brewing rice pudding stout beer this time on draft and it was delicious.  We used a Groupon and it was reasonable."}
{"text":"Great place. Small and comfortable. Excellent beer selection and wonderful food. What I also love is their social consciousness. They  are  always  willing to give a percentage of their sales to a great cause.  Did I mention that it is an old house in downtown phoenix, and that lends to its charm."}
{"text":"Great patio, friendly staff, super yummy cauliflower tacos. Everything I've tasted here has been delicious, so there's really nothing on the menu you could go wrong with.  If you're looking for somewhere to work, note that there are very few electrical outlets here so charge up that battery before heading out."}
{"text":"First time here.  Had the red potato and garbonzo bean burger and a couple of their pastries. The food and the people were so great! We'll be back a lot. Highly recommend, even if you're not vegetarian."}
{"text":"The Coronado PHX   I tried a few different dishes. So read below to see what I thought of each. I enjoyed the space and decor and loved that there were books and games to play! I started to read a book while there! The environment was laid back and lots of people were there conversing and doing work on laptops. Check on my pictures below!   Vegan biscuits and gravy  Mmm mmmm mmmmmm. Home style cooking! Really tasty and tasted just like non vegan biscuits and gravy would have. I would have liked for it to have a little more flavor but it was still filling.   Vegan Spiced muffin  Yum!!! Probably my favorite dish that I had. It was extremely moist and just the right amount of sweetness. It wasn't heavy like the biscuits and gravy and tasted perfect for a breakfast dish or snack. It also was very fresh and a decent size.   Vegan Fried avocado with chips  Wow! What a unique spin on the traditional guacamole and chips. This dish was beautifully prepared and had a slight kick to it. The fried avocado was nice and crispy and there was a perfect amount of chips for dipping. I loved the avocado sauce drizzled on top.   Tofu scramble breakfast Sammy ( I can't remember the exact name)  Such a Flavor packed breakfast sandwich  loaded with some fresh veggies like mushrooms, spinach, and tomatoes. Usually when I try to make a tofu scramble at home, it never turns out right. But this definitely hit the spot. I wish the bread choice was different because it seemed to crumble and fall apart."}
{"text":"Love this place. The fried guacamole is to die for, the red potato  garbanzo bean burger is amazing. The desserts are A+ as we'll as their coffees. The only thing is that the place is kinda small, so the place to order gets a little packed, but it's fine because the food is wonderful! The folks who work here are really helpful and nice as well."}
{"text":"Food was excellent but it's crazy expensive. Worth it to try once at least! They had a rose pistachio scone that was really good too."}
{"text":"Indulgent food here! I recommend this spot for those following all diets. Burgers, fries, tacos...they've got it all!! The interior and exterior are designed beautifully!"}
{"text":"I did not care for food, or the drinks. There are much better vegan choices in Phx. I do not recommend the coronado."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food, atmosphere,  and overall vibe. They have awesome vegetarian and vegan choices, coupled with a great selection of beer, wine, and mixed drinks.  The service is also top notch with very limited wait times. The only draw back is that parking is not great, but still a 5 star location in my book."}
{"text":"This place changed my life. Best vegan biscuits and gravy of all time and vegan candy bars- wow! I harbor some resentment to the Coronado only because it has made all other food seem bland in comparison. The air I breathe on the outside is stale compared to the tasteful atmosphere that is THE Coronado. The smiles on passerby feel like grimaces from mere plebeians after witnessing the service and exuberance from the Coronado's amazing staff. I have resigned myself to the fact that the only foreseeable option for a bright future is to eat here for the rest of my life. I guess that doesn't sound so bad."}
{"text":"Imagine a small home turned into a bakery/coffee house/restaurant. The counter where you order is to your left after you enter the front entrance. Restrooms are in the middle of the house and seating wraps around in almost every room. It's a bit tight, so not the best for large groups.  They have late hours, a private lot to park in, and a menu with vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options.  So far I've had the:  -Goat Cheese with Jalape√±o Marmalade -Quesadilla -Street Corn -Fried Guacamole -Brown Sugar Homemade Poptart  Everything has been delicious. My favorite so far is the Street Corn! LOVE the fixings they put on it."}
{"text":"So glad to have found this place. Food was very good. Such a cute place and staff were very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Yum! Yum! Yum! Vegan & vegetarian food with flavor & variety. The service was friendly & accommodating. We had breakfast meals (orders taken all day); breakfast burrito  & crispy cauliflower tacos..."}
{"text":"I noticed on Facebook one afternoon that The Coronado just recently opened and went that same night to see what it was all about. A friend of mine described it as \"a mix between Lux and Braggs\" (RIP), something I definitely agree with after visiting.  The bar is also the counter you order food from, and is covered in fresh pastries in little glass cases. They had plenty of cookies, tarts, pies, and even a pineapple cake. Water, napkins, and silverware are all self-serve. Seating is also DIY, and while it's limited inside the tiny rooms, there's a huge patio on the side and even a few tables in the front.   My husband and I are obnoxiously small eaters, so we split the jackfruit siders and fries. I nearly licked the plate clean! Flavor and texture was awesome. Spicy mayo was perfect. Between the two of us, it was the ideal amount of food. Even with a full stomach, though, I couldn't help eyeing the Monte Vista Torta ordered by the table next to us. It was gorgeous, and something I will definitely be trying on my next visit."}
{"text":"Love this place for vegetarians and vegans - cauliflower and potato tacos were both great. Good local beer selection too!"}
{"text":"This please is super cute! It offers many great vegan/vegetarian options! Plus they are pet friendly, so bring your pups! I tried their avocado sandwich and it was delicious! They use real avocados, not that fake avocado paste other places use. It's great for groups or individuals! And their outdoor area has shade and fans to keep us Arizonans fresh."}
{"text":"As a vegan who is allergic to corn, I can't have much except the desserts, alcoholic beverages and the sweet potatoes. Probably won't go there again unless I'm in the area and want a sweet treat.."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere, excellent food, polite staff and patrons.  Games and a variety of seating areas provide a fun experience for small to medium sized groups.  The patios would be great if it wasn't so hot outside, but it is June in Phoenix.   Had the avocado pesto sandwich with fries and the cauliflower tacos- delicious!   Will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"Cute little place right on, and I mean right on, 7th Street. We ordered the fried guacamole nachos (excellent), and the quesadilla (good, but a little messy).  I'm not a vegetarian and even I'd come back :)"}
{"text":"A vegan's dream located in the heart of the historic Coronado district! The biscuits & gravy were hearty & delicious. The fried guacamole was fun & made my mouth so happy! The tofu scramble had a fantastic taste with just the right amount of seasonings. Definitely get the fresh squeezed orange juice  We loaded up on sweets for our Grand Canyon trip (rosemary chocolate chip cookies, cookies & cream brownies, lemon scones, cherry pie scones, pecan pie pop tart, & a cinnamon roll pop tart) & they are all scrumptious!"}
{"text":"My first time trying Vegan & I loved it! I will still be eating meat but this place was great! I had cauliflower taco's that were to die for I didn't even miss the meat. This place is a quaint little house with good drinks...they even have moonshine & great 80's music! Definately a recommend!"}
{"text":"I tried this place.  The food we ordered was bland and the service took forever, even though there were only three other customers.  The reason for one star is that the place smells overwhelming like Body Odor. It makes the experience very unpleasant. I don't know if it's coming from the staff or other customers, but I will not try this place again. It was so bad , we still smelled it in the car.  There are far better vegan options out there."}
{"text":"Quirky little place with great staff and vegetarian food. Indoor and outdoor seating options. Neighborhood feel. Looks like lots of locals and friends eat here. Coffee was spot on. Some parking out back but if full there is street parking. We would eat here again if in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious cauliflower tacos!!! Must get if you're here. The southwest salad is really good too. They also have began baked goods , fresh juice and assorted coffee I got cold brew and horchlatte which I really liked !"}
{"text":"The staff was so distracted with their own conversation that they did not even notice that I stood at the counter for several minutes while they had their back to me. There were eight of us in our party and nobody enjoyed their meal.  Utterly disappointing! I can't begin to describe how tasteless and dry the food was. Definitely go here if you are into poor service and food that tastes like a cardboard box.  This is one of those \"I wish I could give this place ZERO stars\" reviews.  Just gross..."}
{"text":"Everything I have eaten has been delicious and the staff is always helpful and friendly.  Their standout menu item is definitely the cauliflower tacos. It inspired me to figure out how to make them at home and even still, I will  get them from The Coronado whenever I can. The guacamole fries are another thing I specifically crave and seek out when possible, though be forewarned that it is a ton of food! I have raved about their food often enough that all of my close friends and family now love going here as well. :) As an added bonus, they usually have a beer on tap that I love."}
{"text":"Chorizo tacos are off the chain! So delicious! They were ready in less than 10 minutes. Three filled tacos for $10? Worth it. Worth the 25 minute drive. Service is great!"}
{"text":"My family and I love this place.  My youngest son is a pescatarian, so we are always looking for places where he can have some selection.  We have had many of the dishes here like the cauliflower tacos, the fried avocado, egg burritos and more.  Everything was very good - i find myself craving the cauliflower tacos.  They also have a great beers on tap and a full bar."}
{"text":"Met friends for an early dinner. Nice that happy hour is every day 4-7 because every day should be happy. Love the little old house, the ambiance. The servers were friendly but I wish they would just have full table service rather than having to order at the counter. The food was so yum. Loved the cauliflower tacos."}
{"text":"Let me paint you the picture: I was enjoying the 70 degree weather driving around PHX, smiling with my windows down, and blasting tunes. Then I saw The Coronado and it immediately struck my attention. I was going too fast to make a furious right turn, but I couldn't due to traffic and I spent the next 20 minutes winding through the back neighborhoods trying to find a way to get back to this place. Tip: put this in your GPS! Parking is behind the restaurant with very limited/compact spaces.   Once I walked into the cute house-style restaurant, I was greeted by two very friendly employees that introduced themselves, handed me a menu, and then asked if I wanted a cocktail. It was 11am on a Saturday, so I decided to ask if they had mimosas. She said that they weren't on the menu but she'd be happy to make one for me. How sweet!   I ordered the Irish breakfast with cage-free local eggs, beet sausage (vegan), irish soda bread (vegan), and rosemary potatoes (also vegan). When they served the meal to me, the sweet employee asked me if I needed anything else and chatted a little. She was so genuinely lovely and nice that it warmed my heart.   Just thinking about this, I am so happy! It was one of the best meals that I have ever had for breakfast. I am so very excited to go back each weekend and try everything on their menu!"}
{"text":"Hate to go against the grain on this one...but we ordered our meals to go...there were cold upon pick up..(even though waiting for it to be completed)..I ordered the biscuits and gravy...super dry biscuits..and small amount of gravy. Overall, I needed to add some salsa simply to add some flavor to the dish overall.  I will give this place another chance..simply because most people I know like it."}
{"text":"Went back again a month ago and all I gotta say is..WOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWW yeah I can say confidently everything is back to the way it was when it was ALWAYS on point..my god wow..I was speechless I just ate and ate and ate lmfao  they are my favorite restaurant and I don't take them for granted when it's this great..I literally sat in bed that night thanking the universe that the food is back exactly as it normally is  thank you thank you thank you! Once again, I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"Ate here again, fried guacamole, street corn and tacos are yum and all there coffee is great. Prices are okay, $15-20 for lunch. This place has good vegan options and way less croweded than GREEN, which is down the street. But still the bathroom decor freaks me out. Lol check it out."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed The Coronado.  The wait staff was helpful and very friendly.  We loved the fried guac and vegan tepary mushroom burger, but the brussel sprout ceasar didn't have enough brussels and didn't have the traditional ceasar taste.    Definitely have to come back to try the vegan pastries though!"}
{"text":"This was an out of the way spot with a small parking lot and inside seating area.  Very cozy decor and it felt like I was in someone's home who was making food for everyone.  It was quaint to say the least.  I sat outside at one of the picnic tables and had a good wait for my breakfast with my wife.  When it arrived though....so tasty.  Possibly the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had.  I tried the \"Good Morning Sandwich\" and it was well worth the wait.  My wife had the chorizo tacos and they were so good, she even shared a bite with me!   I'm a fan of this place for sure.  My only displeasure was with the wait time for our food.  But I'm more than willing to go back again!"}
{"text":"I love the Coronado neighborhood and the restaurants that line 7th St. I dropped by here for a quick bite on my way to work. This place was once the Coronado Cafe and is now just The Coronado (owned by the same owner that managed Bragg's Factory Diner on Grand Ave). The converted home they operate out of has a lot of history in the area and makes for a nice relaxed dining experience. The Coronado is counter service and they have both indoor and outdoor patio seating. The menu is vegetarian and consists of breakfast, small bites and sandwiches. The counter area serves wine/beer/alcohol and is a full espresso bar. I ordered the Red Potato & Garbanzo Burger and really enjoyed the flavor of the agave mustard they top it with. The street corn was quite delicious as well. The atmosphere was super laid back and they do a great job of creating a nice community feel while you are here. Some people were here for dinner, some on laptops and others playing board games or just having a conversation. My only gripe was that there wasn't a whole lot of pastries to choose from (probably because I came just before closing time)."}
{"text":"I miss Bragg's Diner.  I'm not a vegan, not even a vegetarian.  But Bragg's had some darn good food.  Their Grand Ave restaurant was also set in what was originally the old Bragg's Pie Factory.  And Bragg's Diner lived up to the building's namesake with some delicious sweet treats.  Unfortunately, Bragg's is now long gone.  But the owners of Bragg's quickly reappeared in the building that once housed the old Coronado Cafe.  After a failed attempt to resurrect the Coronado Cafe by the previous owners, Bragg's owner Liam Murtagh and his crew transformed the old cafe into The Coronado.  Just like Bragg's the food here is primarily vegan with a few non-vegan items mixed in.  Let's see what Murtagh has come up with shall we?  The restaurant itself has a very old soul.  The bones of the building on 7th Street and Monte Vista are relatively unchanged after all these years.  There's some noticeable changes in the decor from The Coronado's prior iterations, but overall the setup is the same.  An old house with multiple small rooms on the inside and a roomy patio area on the outside.  Order at the front counter, grab a number, pick a seat.  I picked the tiny corner room in the back where there's seating for just six.  Its a quaint but cozy little corner and there are shelves upon shelves of board games and books back there.  Perfect little area to kill time reading, chatting with friends, or play one of those board games.  For my first go around here, I decided on a burger.  Ah but I did say this place is primarily vegan didn't I?  This burger is made using garbanzo beans and red potatoes.  Topped with spinach, tomato, and agave mustard.  The bun almost has the texture of a hardened buttermilk biscuit, though thankfully not as flaky.  Came with a side of fries.  Also got one of their house made cherry pop tarts because, well it was just staring at me from the pastry case.  Total cost including tax came to about $16.  Admittedly more expensive than a burger meal you'd get elsewhere, but healthier options often are.  The burger was pretty solid.  The difference in texture from a regular burger was noticeable, but for the most part that didn't take away from the flavor profile.  The mustard was definitely the star of this dish.  Not too spicy, but had just enough to give it a little kick.  Very clean flavors and not heavy at all.  The fries were also cooked just right.  Would've liked a little more cherry filling in my pop tart than I got, but it was still a satisfactory dessert.  Overall a good meal and pretty much in line with the type of meals I remember eating at Bragg's.  So now you have three distinct options on 7th Street if you're a vegan.  Green, Nami, and now The Coronado.  The atmosphere here was super chill like that of a coffee house.  The crowd and staff here during my visit were pretty progressive (borderline hippie in some spots), but friendly and relaxed.  Like I said, I'm a carnivore but even I can appreciate when a vegetarian establishment hits on a good concept.  Bragg's had a winning formula for years.  It appears The Coronado has found its mojo too."}
{"text":"Get the jackfruit.... I mean right now, go get the jackfruit.  The staff is very friendly. The pastries are fresh and amazing. The jackfruit is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, period. Even the drinks are fantastic."}
{"text":"Some of the best vegan food I've ever tasted.  They specialize in yummy fresh food, not fake meats.   The Cauliflower and Potato tacos are amazing.   So are the red bean quesadillas.   And the lavender soy latte was the best coffee drink I've ever had.     I highly recommend the Coronado"}
{"text":"I had followed this cafe/bar on Instagram for months and when stopping in Phoenix today, thought I'd finally try it. It is small and was crowded but the staff was uber friendly. I got the Horchatte which is part horchata and part latte as well as the Huevos Rancheros. And I must say that this was the first time in WEEKS I was truly eating something I was excited to eat. The corn tortillas, vegetarian \"black coffee\" chili, fried eggs (you can choose tofu) and Oaxaca cheese with some hot sauce that they give you if you want was PHENOMENAL. I inhaled it. It's one of those place that you'd go back later to have the exact same meal. I recommend this place to anyone who wants a restaurant that makes their stomach and taste buds happy. I can't wait to eat my way through their menu."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. I an addicted to the Jalapeno marmalade quesadilla, fried guac, and horchata latte. They have all vegetarian and vegan options with a coffee bar and bakery items. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and cool vibe. I love coming here with my family both for the politics and the food. It is an oasis for us. A place to be visible, seen, and surrounded by love and acceptance. Plus, the food rocks!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I were super excited to try this Vegan spot, since we had heard good things about it. Our food was cold, and it seemed old. We definitely don't plan on eating here again. The customer service wasn't the greatest either."}
{"text":"Wonderful spot with a great vibe and solid vegan options. Staff is super helpful in helping me narrow down what to order. I was tempted to get the famous cauliflower tacos and opted for the chili fries instead. They were really delicious. Outdoor seating is really nice (there are tables inside too) and parking was easy in the back. Would definitely return to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Blood Orange cake = yum Breakfast Burrito = delish House lemonade = refreshing I wish they would change the main image on their Yelp profile, because I thought it was a more stuffy/old fashioned/grandma joint (I imagined a Victorian home redone for high tea). There are definitely more piercings, bare bellies and tattoos than the average lunch place - in a good way. Super fun, great staff, very friendly patrons."}
{"text":"I've probably been to The Coronado 10 times in the last couple months.  I like to start with an iced horchatte (house made vegan horchata w/ espresso).  Today, I'm enjoying a Rosemary caramel chocolate chip cookie as I wait for my avocado sandwich with vegan pesto, spinach and tomato toppings.    I also recommend their tacos and elote!  Cauliflower on another level:)  The Coronado is a definite must try spot for vegans, vegetarians and for omnivores like myself:)."}
{"text":"Super friendly staffs! I got the tacos which was heavenly good! I love the homie feelings of all the unique decorations in the seating area. This place has so much personality on top of its great food!"}
{"text":"I'm not Vegan or Vegetarian but I swear by this place! We usually get all three of the tacos and mix and match with each other. Amazing food and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"This afternoon was my first time trying The Coronado and I was so impressed. It's a small place with order at the counter style service- yet cute atmosphere.   We all got drinks, mine was their take on a Kentucky Mule (Whiskey, Ginger & Lime) which was just ok in my opinion. My fianc√© got the Evergreen (Tequila, Serrano Peppers, Cucumber) and it was amazing- truly a delicious and different drink.  We started off with the street corn which was flavorful, crispy roasted outside and perfectly cooked. Then we shared the Potato Tacos which were excellent and bursting with flavor! Literally one of the best vegetarian dishes I've had in awhile. I want to try the cauliflower tacos next. My friends ordered the Jackfruit Sliders and Potato/Chickpea Burger and loved theirs as well.   Their prices are a little higher but the quality of the food was well worth it in my opinion. We love Green and Nami and this isn't a replacement for them, it's just another option with different flavors.   Well done Coronado!  I can't wait to try it again and hope it's just as good."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! Super hip and friendly service. Dog friendly patio, water misters on and fans to keep the patio cool. I love the art on the inside and general decor is urban yet modern.   The menu boasts many vegan options. Everything is described throughly and its hard to chose just one dish. The bests are the corn, cauliflower tacos, and definitely the drinks. Brown sugar lemonade, horchata, and chocolate soda with organic vodka. All delicious!  The parking lot is small but its not that big of an issue. I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"The Coronado:   If Carnivores talked like Vegans:   \"Do you know that carrot was alive at one time?\"  \"Do you know how many fields died for that salad?\"  \"Did you know that everyday thousands of watermelon's are taken from away from their mothers & their field?!l  -- insert air of hostility--  \"This cabbage died just so you could be Vegan.\"  \"Is that broccoli Farm raised, cage free?\"  Just a point though; you don't see carnivores at a steak house like: \"can you make this steak taste like lettuce?\"  Just sayin'.   Look, all joking aside, I know I'll catch flack for this but to hell with it, what elevates Us above the tiers of the animal kingdom is the ability to laugh, and laugh at ourselves.   Don't take life to seriously, you'll never get outta here alive.   Truth is, I'm no stranger to plant-based meal plans & I've been a Coronado Fan-Girl (#Vagitarian) for a little over a while.   Their Facebook, their Social Media--I can only describe it as a Campaign against ignorance.   All I can say is: commendable...beyond admiration.   In the end, I'll leave you with this fact: the term 'Vegan', is an archaic Word from the Olmec translation for 'Bad Hunter'.   ;-)  I loved the vibe of this place. It's like an Oregon house Wizard Of Oz'ed down to A-Hell-I-Zona.   Whether you're a carnivore or or a Vagitarian--you are what you eat, all pun intended--I recommend you try Coronado.   Expand your mind, and if you don't like it, fine. All the more for me.   Best part for me is the family. I grew up without one and from watching the crew you could tell there was a lot of family in this old house.   To me, that's the best history/memories. You can't count that, you can't pay for that many Smiles."}
{"text":"Cute little spot to grab lunch or a snack. Good service. I've been here twice and agree with others, the parking is horrible but I came this time after the lunch rush so it was fine. PROS: delicious red bean quesadilla and cauliflower tacos.  CONS: Most expensive little glass of lemonande EVER lol.  The lemonade was delish...just not enough when I realized out small the glass was. Make sure you get a little ice."}
{"text":"I am definitely not someone who actively seeks out vegan friendly restaurants, but the menu here caught my attention. There were TONS of tempting items to choose from... ultimately my wife and I shared the Cauliflower Tacos, Potato Tacos, and Street Corn. All I can say is \"Wow!\". The food here is fantastic! Not just in flavor, but in presentation and sheer  creativity in the flavor combos. Never in a million years did I expect a restaurant that specializes in vegan and vegetarian fare to be one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix, however this place earned its spot near the top of the list of places I'll be frequenting on a regular basis. Absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"I am not a vegan or vegetarian. I am however, up for trying new and tasty foods. This little place did not disappoint! The potato tacos are where it's at, so fresh and delicious. OH and I am sucker for outstanding black tea. Their black iced tea was absolutely wonderful. I could drink it everyday. I can't wait to go back and try the cauliflower tacos!"}
{"text":"The night I was here for Simpsons trivia, they had no deserts to go with coffee, only one slice of mediocre pumpkin pie. Server was like, \"Meh,\" not very helpful."}
{"text":"Poor customer service snd management. Ive paid less for much better quality food, atmosphere & ambience any many many other restaurants in PHX"}
{"text":"Great potential, but not sure this concept will make it.  We stopped in hoping to have a drink at the bar, but that is not really possible the way it is set-up.  The menu was pretty limited too, so doubt we will come back.  It took awhile to get service and they seemed bothered to be helping us.  This location is truly unique, but the way they are using the space does not highlight all of its positives."}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful and the food is too! We rolled in with 9 people (yikes) and were graciously received by the super-hip staff and owners. I got a lavender cookie sandwich and cauliflower tacos. Cute dogs and good-looking patrons on the patio, delicious vegan food in generous portions, instagrammable pastry case, coffee delicacies and a full bar... we will be back!"}
{"text":"So much Yum. Pulled off the freeway and found this   place. Potato tacos, fried guacamole, and a side of fries with ketchup I could drink up!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Coronado last night. Loved the hippie/casual/friendly vibe. Sat outside on the dog friendly terrace. Kind of sad we didn't have our dog along.  Are some great food. Had the fried guacamole which was big enough to share. My husband had the cauliflower tacos and through they were delicious. I had the Ceasar salad. It was super. The Brussels sprouts were good and made it feel like a meal. The tehini dressing was super.  Would come back here for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Ate at this adorable little place last night for the 1st time for my 54th birthday dinner &omg amazing!!! There were 6 of us in our group &from the time i walked in until we left everyone there was so kind. The girl at the counter immediately explained we seat ourselves &order/pay at the counter &then they bring the food to us...she was incredibly kind. We seated ourselves in a little room toward the back of the house &even the other customers were friendly &so chill. &the food?...incredible! I got the cauliflower tacos &fried guacamole, so good. The cauliflower was cooked perfect...not too hard, not too soft. Service was great &really made us feel welcome thank you Coronado... we eat out every friday night &i think i just found my new little gem...definitely will be back"}
{"text":"The Coronado has become my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  Hands down.  Always good food, drinks, service and atmosphere   Plus, they live their values."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice before and as someone who has eaten at a handful of vegan spots across the country, I would say this one is just okay. The service is really spotty and I can attest to other reviewers complaints that some of the staff are not so friendly. It's also kind of inexcusable to me to serve store-bought tortillas in Phoenix. The mason jar thing has also been done to death, just use some decent glassware already. Lastly, the seating situation is frustrating and doesn't make a whole lot of sense for the space.   The picture I've submitted is the owner herself, Emily, pleading for fake positive reviews (which the owners are notorious for.) This has nothing to do with my own feelings on their personal stance on law enforcement but instead in hopes that Yelp will see this and crack down on it. It's unfair to other local restaurants that actually earn their positive reviews instead of paying for them or soliciting their friends/family to write them."}
{"text":"I loved the ambiance .  The staff was friendly and paid attention to food preferences. The food was fresh and full of flavor.  It was satisfying and filling. Horchata was delicious.  It was a beautiful day and enjoyed eating al fresco"}
{"text":"The Coronado is one of the few places in town that does vegetarian/vegan food right.  They don't try to go overboard with holistic or intimidating ingredients. They don't try to make entrees that try too hard to substitute meat. They just take whole foods and turn them into ridiculously craveable plates.   The food is always delicious whether you're going for a weekend brunch, weekday happy hour, or late night meal. The cocktails are fresh and range from classic to experimental. The overall vibe is relaxed and grassroots.  So, don't fall for the assumption that vegetarian/vegan can't be satisfying; come to The Coronado and let them win you over with the palm and an order of potato tacos."}
{"text":"Many good vegetarian and vegan option that are very good. Street corn and the Caesar salad were good sides to go with the cauliflower tacos. Very busy, but worth a try."}
{"text":"I've been here on so many different occasions; working by myself, hang outs with friends, and evening dates. The Coronado house alone has such a nice vibe to it, there are separate rooms you can choose to sit in and plenty of seating arrangements outside. It's really easy to split multiple things on the menu if you can't decide on just one and it's definitely filling. I recommend going during happy hour cause their drinks are awesome. Staff is great, always making good short conversation. I do wish that some of their breakfast items (like their scramble) had a little more to it because of the price but I ain't totally hatin, all around thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great little find.   Today was our second visit and both times exceeded expectations.  It's in an old house and has a cute little outdoor patio.  Plate presentation was lovely.  I recommend cauliflower tacos or jackfruit sliders.  Vegetarian/vegan."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. The food we received was overcooked and incredibly bland. When we complained to the manager/owner they acted as if we were lucky to even have the opportunity to dine at their restaurant. The food is awful and so is management. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful vegetarian spot with lots of vegan selections. The space is cozy with great outdoor space, the staff are friendly and helpful and very attentive even though it is a counter service restaurant. The masa breaded cauliflower tacos were delicious and plentiful. The roasted Brussels Sprout Caesar salad was good but could have benefitted from more Brussels Sprouts and the French fries were delicious and came with a cinnamon scented, tomato based dipping sauce that was really delicious and unique. Every dish we saw delivered to the packed patio looked delicious and made us agree we would come back to try more."}
{"text":"Right across from Green and Nami, The Coronado is a house converted into a restaurant. Upon entering, they had coffee, beer, and pastries. I ordered from the happy hour menu, which is a huge chunk of the menu, and got my number. I chose patio seating on these huge patio tables. I picked the fried guacamole, which was pretty standard, and the red bean quesadilla. I didn't think this would be good, but it was amazing! It's savory with red peppers and a nacho cheeze sauce on top and they provide huge portions. I only ate half and saved the rest for later - unfortunately, the tortilla got soggy so it wasn't as good the next day."}
{"text":"Best food ever. Amazing tacos and street corn. All vegan and vegetarian, plus they'll try to accommodate you to make anything vegan. A+"}
{"text":"Great food! My family is vegan, I am not so I was very iffy about trying Coronado. It was really great! Honestly, it's so tasty and fresh that you wouldn't even know that it was vegan. They have delicious pastries and great lattes!! Highly recommend this restaurant! The only reason I am giving them four stars is because of the seating. They're pretty busy and their seating is usually taken if you're visiting on a Friday night or weekend."}
{"text":"What a friendly place!  Went down town to get some coffee and didn't realize that Cartel was closed.   Did a search and ended up here.   The coffee was good and the staff was very informative.   We just moved from Portland and we're having trouble finding good places to eat.   The staff gave us a list of 8 different places to try. Plan on coming back for breakfast and to try the horchattee."}
{"text":"Definitely coming back here. The staff was friendly and checked up on my to make sure everything was alright. I only wish there were more outlets so I could do homework, but I understand why. I ordered the cauliflower tacos after seeing all the great reviews for them and loved them. My food came very quickly. I also had a small hot chai latte with almond milk that was delicious."}
{"text":"My new favorite Vegan spot. Cauliflower Tacos are so good, I get them every time. They have a cool patio and the staff is always great. Can get busy at times, but I've been lucky enough to never have to wait for a table. Seriously my favorite spot."}
{"text":"Literally one of my favorite places to eat or even come to do homework at. Everyone is super nice here and the food/ pastries are amazing"}
{"text":"Used to go here quite a bit during week and on the weekends.  The last couple of times it seems that the quality has gone down.  The cauliflower tacos were my fav at one time but now have continuously been served a bit greasy.  We went 2 days ago in the evening and I ordered the biscuits and gravy.  The biscuits were extremely hard.  We also ordered the rosemary cookies and they were truly hard and when we went to exchange for something else, they said it would cost us more lol - when we told them about the cookies as well as demonstrated how hard they were the staff said they had changed the recipe.  I used to love this place but definitely off of my list to never return.  Too bad - good news is New American Green is across the street and always consistent with quality and tasty vegan food."}
{"text":"Great food! With me coming from IL, this has been 1 of very few that has really satisfied my pallet!"}
{"text":"The Potato Tacos and Quesadilla were great.  Definitely will be going back to explore more items on the menu.  The staff was very nice and helpful to work with."}
{"text":"This was my firs time eating here and it is sooo good. I will be back. The serve is great also."}
{"text":"Great vegan food AND parking--joy abounds!  For non-vegans, just ask what's popular and you won't go wrong.  My fav: cauliflower tacos.  Just a heads up:  the food is so good that there may be a wait during the lunch rush!  They really need new, MUCH larger digs now that the word is out on eating animals and their relationship to the  Top 15 things that kill us....  Watch \"How Not to Die\" by Dr. Gregor for details."}
{"text":"Awesome beer on tap selection,  love the food.  Potato tacos are killer good.  Got the torta tonight & the garlic dipping sauce was such a good pairing. Lemonade is awesome too! Chili cheese fries are awesome too! Fried guac is a dream.  Desserts are killer good too! Adorable atmosphere, way better than being at Super quiet grandma's house feel of the cafe that used to be there long ago."}
{"text":"The Coronado is one my favorite vegan-friendly restaurants in Arizona! Their bakery is completely vegan, but you would never guess it. Everything tastes fresh and delicious. I especially love coming for brunch. The pancakes are heavenly. If you come later in the day, the beet burger is a great choice. I love sitting outside when the weather is nice, but sitting inside is a cute experience as well. I really have nothing bad to say- I love the Coronado!"}
{"text":"We decided to avoid a lunch rush and arrived after 2pm. It was pretty busy, though. We waited about 50 mins for our food. After about 45 mins, i went up to ask for a lemonade we had ordered. When they realized how much time had lapsed since our order, they promptly gave us the lemonade and a mini cake, while we continued to wait. This cake reminded me of baked goods my grandmother made.  It was delicious and you could taste the home made in it.  Soon after, food arrived.  The cauliflower tacos were amazing and a zucchini sandwich with fries were great . The ketchup was different and we spent time trying to figure out the secret ingredient, which was cinnamon.  I will be back again."}
{"text":"Always a great meal here even for a meat eater. Love the cauliflower tacos and the chili fries.  The brown sugar is great!   My girls fight over the Rosemary cookies even though they each have their own.  Many things to choose from.  They got the Jackfruit sliders. That's what I'm getting next time"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best meal of my recent trip through New Mexico, Arizona and southern California was at The Coronado in Phoenix. And -- much to my surprise and delight -- it was totally vegetarian/vegan!  This is not a fancy restaurant -- though it is somewhat quaint and quirky (check out the photos on the restroom walls). You order and pay at the counter, you get a number, you get your drinks at the bar, you select a table somewhere in the bungalow or on the patio, and you wait for your food to come.   I ordered a \"bean burger\" (a tepary bean and mushroom patty topped with roasted tomatoes, arugula & vegan mayo on a bun) along with fries and a beer. The flavor, the texture, the condiments, the bun, and the overall quality of the \"burger\" was excellent. Even meat eaters (such as I normally am) will be fully sated. And the fries were as good as any I have eaten at any establishment. Should a carnivore end up eating here with vegan friends (or by accident) the fries alone should satisfy them. A side of grilled street corn on the cob swimming in vegan mayo and dusted with spices was also quite good.   My only complaint -- and it is a small one -- is serving beer in pint jars. Yes, it assures me that I received a pint, but I like real beer glasses.  So -- herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores alike -- If you like tasty food you should be satisfied at The Coronado PHX."}
{"text":"I ordered the Goat Cheese and Jalape√±o Marmalade Quesadilla to go. It wasn't until I was home and eating that I realized there was no jalape√±o marmalade on the quesadilla. I have ordered this before and was quite surprised at the lack of a main ingredient. I called and asked to speak with a manager so I could inform them of this (hopefully) oversight. I was told that the owner was too busy working the line and he (Liam?) would call me back. I left my name an number, It was about 1:30pm so I anticipated a call within a few hours. It is now THREE days later and I never received a call. Very UNsatisfied customer!!!!"}
{"text":"We arrived around 5:30 p.m. to beat the rush of Saturday diners. I am glad we did because we got a chance to look around the ecclectic house to find a table we liked. After claiming a spot as our own, I walked back up to the bar to place our order with the bartender. She was super nice and extremely knowledgeable about everything on the menu. We ordered fried guacamole, jackfruit sliders (we ordered it on sandwich bread, to make it vegan), and the burrito.    The chips that came with the guacamole were crisp and flavorful and the fries that accompanied the jackfruit sandwich and burrito were incredible. I don't usually eat fries, but these were the perfect size to enable the slightly crusted outside to contrast its soft, starchy inside. We cleaned our plates and we walked out full and happy.   We liked this place and will return again. It is awesome that their menu only contains vegetarian and vegan options. It shows that this place is definitely cognizant of compassion for animals and the environment.   Some other people's post talk about the menu being limited in choice. I actually prefer that because I tend to get the FOMO shakes. That is, the fear of missing out shakes. With a limited menu, it makes making a confident decision so much easier."}
{"text":"A few days in a Phoenix hotel this week came with free food.  Unfortunately, Bud Light and strange-looking egg disks were among the uninspiring offerings.  An escape was in order.  Thankfully, The Coronado is like going to a friend's house because, well, it's a house.  I can always depend on the huevos rancheros.  This was the first time I tried the goat cheese quesadillas and cauliflower tacos and they were very good."}
{"text":"My first time here due to a recommendation. Recently have been leaning towards a \"meatless\" diet and have tried a few places; so far. The Coronado has a great selection for anyones appetite. I tried the cauliflower tacos and the friend guacamole and it was great! Indoor and outdoor patio seating is a plus. Definitely will be back sooner than later."}
{"text":"I love it, I want to visit phoenix to try the best cauliflower tacos again yummm!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect when we walked in. We were headed home after a business appointment downtown and we were suddenly famished. There were lots of interesting looking restaurants but my husband had heard of this place so decided to dine here.   We parked on the side street because near noon the parking lot was already full. We walked in through the patio and entered the old house which is now the restaurant. It was cozy and lively music was playing. We grabbed a menu and stood in a short line. I was in the mood for a big juicy burger. That was not to be the outcome. This place is vegetarian and vegan. The burgers didn't look appealing to me but the menu was very interesting. We both decided on the huevos rancheros and what a score! They were delicious. We were served two corn tortillas topped with a veggie chili, light cheese and two perfectly cooked eggs. I was full by the time we were finished. I really wanted to try something from the pastry case but I am still eating light after a glutinous Thanksgiving. Darn it!    Service was friendly and food came out on a reasonable time in spite of the noon hour. I'd go back and be more adventurous next time and I'll grab a scone there too!"}
{"text":"Food is great, the patio is small but makes a cozy place to talk, feels just like a home patio. I had the farmyard vegetable scramble with a coconut latte. Staff is very friendly and accommodating not to mention how fast they had our food ready.   Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"One thing that I'm rather embarrassed to admit upfront is that I've never had a purely vegan meal. Not to belabor the point, but the Coronado has definitely sold me on the proposition of eating a strictly plant based cuisine. Definitely not going to make declarative statements comparing this to other vegan establishments in the valley, but I would recommend this for anybody who wants to either try that branch of cuisine or wants a low key place to grab a tasty meal.   The first thing that sticks out to me is the building itself. It's in a retrofitted older house in the Coronado neighborhood of Phoenix, and that gives it some character. Cramped is a word that you could easily use to describe the interior; I felt like I was about to run into somebody else on a few occasions while inside. I also want to point out the rad pictures in one of the restrooms, just a bunch of kids wearing creepy masks. It doesn't add much overall, but it was enjoyable in a weird way.   As for the food, this is the most positive part about the establishment. My dining companion and I ordered a hummus plate to share, and they had the chorizo tacos with eggs and I had the cauliflower tacos. The hummus plate was delicious; it comes with cucumbers, carrots, fresh jalape√±os, and chips. The texture was a little on the chunkier side, but it paired well with the vegetables on the plate. The cauliflower tacos exceeded my expectations by having this tangy, crunchy edge. The guacamole in it also helps tie it all together. It definitely set a high bar for vegan meals in the future. I can't comment on the faux chorizo in those tacos, but my companion had nothing but good things to say about them. Last thing to point out is they have a good drip coffee offering, and it's cool that it has self refills.  So if you want to get some vegan food, this is a place to get it. There may or may not be better vegan options in the area, but to reiterate this was my first experience with vegan cuisine. There are some concerns about the overall tightness of the space here, but it's not enough to ruin the entire experience."}
{"text":"Found myself in a Girls Night Out situation last Friday night during the peak dinner time at The Coronado and was highly impressed.  Being my first time I asked a lot of questions about the food on the menu.  The avacado sauce? Yep, vegan.  The Santa Fe Sauce? Yep, vegan.  The delicious looking vanilla bean and orange marmalade cake and other delicious looking pastries? You guessed it, vegan! They even had a vegan horchatte (horchata and espresso)! I can definitely say with certainty that I was fully satisfied when I left, only barely stopping myself from buying the remainder of the vanilla bean orange marmalade cake that was left to smuggle into the show I was attending with my friend and a couple of forks.  Barely resisted.  Like almost gave in. I will definitely be back again as often as I can make it as there was a lot more food I wanted to try.  As for the cake, it better not be there the next time I go or I may not be able to resist.  Is it wrong to want to go to a restaurant just to eat an entire cake and a horchatte?"}
{"text":"Definitely this place needs multiple visits. Very unique options on the menu. Ordered - Cauliflower Tacos : tasted really good and portion is meal perfect. Cauliflowers are deep fried and not too oily which is what I like. Topped with pumpkin seeds and tad of tangy lime. Not the best taco I had but outstands many. Horchatta : not a espresso fan, but I kinda liked it.   Great ambience, Cool interior design and well maintained hygiene. Totally worth multiple tries."}
{"text":"It's become a day off ritual of mine to treat myself to a lovely meal at the Coronado, but I almost didn't come today in favor of trying somewhere new.  Last minute,  I opted for the closer to home option, and I am so glad I did.  I got the Evergreen to drink,  and it is absolutely my new favorite drink. I can't believe it took me this long to try it.  It has muddled cilantro, cucumber, and serrano peppers, made with tequila and Cointreau. It is spicy and refreshing! I had the street corn as an appetizer, which was delicious, and the calabacitas burrito. So freaking good.  Another new favorite of mine off the menu. I don't know what the sauce they serve on the side is,  but it was a spicy chipotle-y awesomeness and I want it on everything. I took a bag of Xanadu coffee and a piece of peanut butter chocolate cake to go. The cake is rich, and moist, and amazing.  I really rarely write yelp reviews, but i've written three for this place because every time I leave I am so ecstatic I have to share the entire experience."}
{"text":"I want to love this place and my first visit I did. I'm actually really sad to give this place 2 stars, because on a good day they are 5 stars, but that's the problem. Consistent quality.   My first visit, I had just an app and a cocktail, and I was blown away. It was so good! My next visit, tried those famous cauliflower tacos and was blown away- so good.  The visit I tried potato tacos. They were not great. Really dry and bland. I thought, maybe this just isn't the right thing to order. I tasted my friends chorizo and tofu tacos and they were pretty good though.  Next visit, apparently the manager went on vacation and didn't order any food. They were out of 60% of the menu. We got the fried guacomole- just unfried because they didn't have any of the crumbs. Went ahead and ordered the cauliflower tacos and the chorizo tacos, since they were out of nearly everything else. This time the cauliflower was fried too long and dark brown and soggy. Still edible, but not as delicious.  Then take another friend yesterday. We split cauliflower tacos and jackfruit sandwhich. 2 of the 3 cauliflower tacos are awesome. The 3rd has raw coating on half of the cauliflower... wet sticky brown stuff. That was not good. Then the jackfruit sandwhich. Sorry for this... Yuck. It was gross. I cook jackfruit too. To be more detailed than \"yuck\". It was bland, like no salt or seasoning. There wasn't any pop to the flavor, no salt, no acid. The texture was mainly mushy with a mild sweet undertone. It was just disgusting. I tried adding lots of salt and lime juice... anything I could put on it to make it palatable. It was just terrible. The salad that came with was good.  So, this place is hit or miss. It bums me out, because I am strictly plant based and really appreciate vegan restaurants that do more than just fake meats. The staff is always polite, the casual atmosphere is cool, but if the food is great one day disgusting the next. Well, that's not okay- that doesn't qualify for 3-4 or 5 stars. They have to get it together. I really hope they do too, because it could should and has been great."}
{"text":"On both of my recent visits to The Coronado, expectations have been exceeded! On my first visit, I went with the guacamole fries ... Hand-cut fries topped with fresh guac and vegan chili.  That's pretty much a vegan's heaven for indulgence foods. I could not finish this order.  Ate about half of it and saved the rest for another meal.  I also had a small salad on the side which was perfect to lighten up my meal of fries!   The second visit I had the cauliflower tacos... I didn't think they could top the chili-guac fries, but they did!  I will definitely be back for those tacos!  I also got a s'mores cookie sandwich.  This was two choc chip cookies sandwiched with a fluffy vanilla-ish frosting type of substance.  It was good, DECADENT, but not like a s'mores.  I'm sort of a s'mores-aholic, so I'm a tough critic.  I should also note it was very oily.  Soaked through the paper baggie they put it in for to-go orders.  I'd suggest less butter substitute and darker chocolate in the cookie recipe, and something containing marshmallows on the inside filling.    Its a small place, but they've always had table open when I've stopped in towards the end of happy hour.  It is counter service, so place your order at the front, take your number and sit and wait for the deliciousness."}
{"text":"Stopped into this place for breakfast as a nice start to a road trip. We had heard about it from a vegan group I belong to on Facebook. Loved it! The renovated house is super cute and trendy. We loved the old timey cash register and the decor. The pictures in the bathrooms were uber-creepy, reminded us of Season One of True Detective, but the rest was all tasteful and adorbs. We had the biscuits and gravy, jalapeno waffles and a spicy dirty chai. It was all delicious! The service was amazing, friendly and fast. Although we did not partake, it looks like they have a liquor license and have a happy hour. I can only hope that this location will keep busy since they have a bit of competition right across the street from Green and Nami. Although no alcohol is served at the other spots. Everything is vegetarian here and mostly vegan. Can't wait to go back and try it for dinner!"}
{"text":"For vegan/vegetarian food this has definitely gotta be at the top of the list. Came with a party of 4 and we ordered some shared appies and a few entrees. Fried guacamole was great. Very unique and the chips and the sauce were fantastic. Best thing of the night was the cauliflower tacos. Just get these when you come here. Great dish. Last but most certainly not least, you have to try the rosemary chocolate chip cookie. This is literally on my top 3 favorite cookies list and I usually don't toss around those words lightly. Incredible.   Very small restaurant so probably not good for a large group unless you can snag a few tables outside. Also, was not impressed with their cocktails. If this place improved their drinks a bit I can see myself coming back here many times."}
{"text":"I've been coming here pretty consistently for about a month now and every time been here I've always been treated like a friend. The entire staff is so friendly and the food they have is great! The food is vegan but tastes amazing. The coffee and cold brew are nice and strong! There is plenty of seating and is the perfect place to study or meet with friends. If you're in the neighborhood or need a new coffee shop this is the place!"}
{"text":"This place is Phenomenal! My new favorite vegetarian/Vegan restaurant! The portions are huge! The happy hour pricing makes me even happier, and I have yet to try something I didn' like. My favorite thing on the menu is the street corn, I ask to leave off the cheese (as I have a dairy allergy) and I love how accommodating the staff is to certain diet needs! I also enjoy the fact that they don't use fake meat or fake cheese or anything overly processed in their menu. The vegan pastries are fantastic and the cocktails are to die for!"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to eating here after reading the reviews.  But, I realize now that the rating is high because there are few alternative vegan/vegetarian places in Phoenix. The breakfast was fine, just not all what I was hoping for.    Breakfast tofu eggs were spiced but, it was one-note, nothing special.  Breakfast potatoes (fried russet) were served hot but very bland (no veggies, etc).  Avocado on toast came with arugula, sprouts, cashew pesto -- sounds good but did not add up to great.    The herbal tea was amazingly good, as was the service, both at the counter and in the kitchen.  The folks working here are awesome.  The cafe has a choice of seating areas that make it a wonderful choice for small groups, as well as singles eating alone.  The Coronado was fine.  And, for Phoenix it may be outstanding.  But, if you've had good vegan breakfasts elsewhere (Tucson Bentley's; Salt Lake City Vertical Diner, etc), then the Coronado won't meet your expectations.  But, if you are lazy and don't feel like cooking breakfast for yourself, then the Coronado is the place to go."}
{"text":"The first time ever eating at a vegan restaurant a few days ago.... and well I was nervous because I love my protein, but I was soooo impressed by the cauliflower tacos it did not give me one second to even think about not having an actual protein on my plate. It was so delicious and packaged well. My order was for pick up and you never know what to expect when you pick up your food but it was done well.   I also had the horchatte it was good however I would have liked to be able to taste the horchata a bit more. It was still really good :) I will be back soon for sure"}
{"text":"This place makes you wish you'd skipped an extra meal ahead of time so there would be more room in your stomach. SO GOOD! The potato tacos and fried guac are my two favorite things so far, but I'll have to try more of the menu before I can be sure ;)"}
{"text":"What an awesome, cute little place, just a block from Nami / Green, so it's part of a little vegan mecca in central Phoenix. Different sections of limited seating here, including a balcony. Tons of choice here. I came once for dinner and once for breakfast, and everything I ordered was delicious -- special mention to the cauliflower tacos and the breakfast tofu scramble. Prices are reasonable, though the portions aren't that big, so I ended up ordering multiple things which can get the price up, but it's still not bad. It's counter service, and then they bring out your food, which took a while for my breakfast meal; though the service was very friendly. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots on seven street definitely go check this place out go support your local businesses"}
{"text":"Excellent mix of Vegan and Vegetarian.  The Cauliflower and Chorizo Tacos were amazing.!"}
{"text":"Before I get started on my first dining experience at The Coronado, I will be completely transparent with you - I am not a Vegetarian, nor am I a Vegan. So what am I doing at this type of joint?  Well, short story long - my wife recently gave birth to a beautiful baby girl a few months ago. Yaaaaaaay...us. Well, basically our not-so-little baby would bust out with crazy rashes all over her chubby face and equally chubby body after Dairy Queen feedings (aka Mommy's breastfeeding sessions). Well, it turns out that our daughter is allergic to dairy, so for the first time ever, my wifey needs to avoid anything with dairy in it for the sake of our baby daughter. So we immediately drove to LGO Pizzeria and ordered a cheese pizza.   Siiiiiiike.   When I heard \"dairy-free\" I initially thought my wife would have to just Bugs Bunny it all the way with carrots for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Well, thank God for The Coronado! So many dairy-free/vegan options! And they actually don't taste like sandpaper. (Come to think of it, I've never actually tried sandpaper.)   Numero Uno Tip Time, folks... When you first arrive here, don't sit outside on the nice patio like complete noobsicles, waiting for the servers to take your order...like we did the first time around. You'll be drenched by the misters before anyone comes by your table to write down your order. Instead, get straight outta Noob City and order inside, at the counter, like the rest of The Coronado pros. Afterwards, you can proceed to the patio with your dignity intact.   At the counter I asked the friendly lady what she recommended, and she said \"The jackfruit sliders are good.\" Then I implied no pressure and asked, \"If you could only choose 1 item on the menu what would it be?\" And she quickly and confidently mentioned, \"The cauliflower tacos - hands down.\" At that very moment, the thought of eating cauliflower tacos sounded as joyous as sucking on tree sap for sustenance.   However, when I took that first bite of the misunderstood cauliflower taco, I was happier than a Brony attending his first My Little Pony club meeting. Waaaaaay better than tree sap. For realz. I would order that sucker again. And again. The cauliflower was delightfully covered In crispy (not overtly thick) batter and topped with creamy sauce goodness. The jackfruit burger was also mighty tasty, so I'm happy my wife and I shared the two dishes. If not, I would've jacked her jackfruit burger. Yeah, I went there. (Ahhh...the marriage benefits we take for granted.) We also shared the horchata latte, as well as the delicious, dairy-free Nutella-style pop tart.   As a non-vegan, married to a wife on a brand new non-dairy diet, we cannot wait to go back to this terrific joint to try new vegan dishes and once again - get our cauliflower on. Like tomorrow."}
{"text":"Interesting! My old man hip factor is way up. A bit slow but an authentic hipster experience for an old dude. Well done to boot.good for them."}
{"text":"The Coronado is amazing! I have eaten here dozens of times and never had a bad experience. Everything is made to order. The fried guac, caesar salad and breakfast burrito are my favorite! The fried guac has crispy fried chips and spicy San Jose sauce. The Caesar salad has black sesame seeds to enhance the flavor of the horseradish dressing. The breakfast burrito has spinach and potatoes with a spicy sauce on the side. Seriously the food here is fantastic! The bakery goods are change daily and are awesome! The crowd is eclectic some business professionals from the area and hipsters. I recommend this place to everyone meat eaters, vegetarians and vegan!!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee shop and restaurant with a dog-friendly patio. I ordered an iced tea and the sweet corn and shared a hummus plate. There were a lot of vegetarian and vegan choices. Everyone was friendly and helpful. It was an awesome stop on our road trip!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness I got the red bean quesadilla and it was amazing. My friend got the huevos rancheros and she loved them. We split a rose water and pistachio scone that was wonderful and vegan as well. This place is amazing plus it has a dog friendly patio. The service was wonderful even though it's counter service since I had a dog with me they brought me my water and were super helpful!  Thank you so much Coronado staff you made my day and my lunch!"}
{"text":"I met up with girlfriends and tried The Coronado for the first time during brunch. The restaurant is very charming and quaint. The food was delicious with many vegetarian and dairy free options. The only thing I wish was different was the incorporation of gluten free options. Regardless, I would visit again! :)"}
{"text":"Went there last night with a bunch of Yelp friends. Lets get the negative out of the way, The parking is sort of almost not there. I think I was the only one who didn't have to look for street parking in our group and that was because I rode my motorcycle. I had the roasted squash sandwich with a side salad and I really enjoyed them. To drink I ordered an iced tea, they actually don't even brew your glass of tea until you order it and then pour it in to a cup of ice to chill it. I chose green and it was good. I also sampled some of other's dishes. The big surprise was the mushroom gravy on biscuits. I may have to try them out for breakfast sometime."}
{"text":"I came here after browsing the Yelp reviews and seeing the review from V.G. below. Thanks bro. As an ardent Anti-Trump citizen and a lover of vegan deliciousness, this place was just amazing! Thank you for the well-crafted cocktails, perfectly presented vegan tastiness, and for your dedication to politics with integrity. I'm sure as more people realize what a train wreck of a president they elected, they'll be by in droves to support a restaurant with excellent food and the ethics to match."}
{"text":"Loved this little place!  We stumbled upon it accidentally while looking for somewhere to eat near the 10.  My friend and I are vegetarian, but our SO's are not.  We saw this place and for some reason my Yelp search made me think is was a mexican place that was not at all vegetarian friendly.  What a nice surprise to find that it was entirely vegetarian!  We had several different entree's.  The street corn (I didn't care for it myself as the corn was really overcooked and hard to eat), the Monte Vista Torta (very good...with yummy baked fries), the Chili and Cornbread (also very good....almost as good as the chili and cornbread I make at home ;-), and the Goat Cheese Quesadilla with Jalapeno Marmalade (the star of the meal...we even ordered a second to share!)  I also had an Evergreen cocktail.  Basically a spicy margarita.  So good, but it was spicy!  Everyone who worked there was so nice and helpful.  Even the owner/chef came out and talked to us.  We ate outside on the porch (yes porch....don't see those too often around here).  I wish it was closer to Chandler so we could eat there more often."}
{"text":"Yes. Yes. Yes. The tacos were amazing. My sister is a vegan so I took her here. I'm down for whatever- trying to eat less of anything with a face on it. The food is SOOOOO GOOD. Also well priced. The seasonings, the flavor, it's all amazing. Some of the better food I've had in Phoenix- vegan or otherwise. Will be returning. Also DOG FRIENDLY patio. A MUST.  *cauliflower tacos *jackfruit burger *guacamole chili fries  Ugh sooooo good."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to check this place out for awhile now, so when I found myself running some errands on that end of town the other morning I decided to stop in to grab a quick bite. The restaurant itself was super cute inside. They had a variety of fresh baked goods - the funfetti scone caught my eye so I got one of those and also ordered a coconut milk mocha. The coffee was good and the scone was excellent. Looking over their regular menu I see that they offer a lot of healthy vegan dishes that sound delicious so I'll definitely be coming back to have a proper sit down meal and explore the menu a little more."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?! These cauliflower tacos are one of the best meals I've ever had! They are deceptively simple. And sooo delicious. Elderflower gin drink is also wonderful. This is a great place with a laid-back vibe. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Visit number two and still unimpressed.   I didn't mentioned in my first review; but the order at the counter concept does not work with their layout. Not at all. It's awkward and cramped.   I can see how it could take quite a bit of time when there is only one person taking orders, making drinks, and answering the phone. The counter gal seemed to be frustrated. She received a phone call from someone trying to order two burgers. She sternly affirmed they were a vegan restaurant and offered no alternative options. She seemed off put and didn't have the best customer service skills, especially when it came to informing meat eaters that vegan restaurants offer 'great food' still!   As a previous bartender I also found it slightly humorous when a female customer asked for a 'really light beer' and she suggested an IPA. She followed with orange blossom which was a much better option. Well there's my nit picky service review.   Food- got the cauliflower tacos. Wanted to love them because I was starving. Over all presentation was great. But I had to add Cholula sauce to give it any flavor. I could hardly taste the red(?) avocado cream dressing. The corn tortillas were also hard :/ the cauliflower was nicely fried but still lacked flavor.   I look forward to the next vegan restaurant...  But hey; thanks for existing. I still chose to come to the Coronado instead of their near by competitor Green. I still vote for vegetables instead of soy based processed mock meats."}
{"text":"Tried this place recently. The place itself leaves a lot to be desired in terms of ambiance. It is quite run down. The service was very slow and they got our order wrong. My daughter asked for vegan bread for her burger. The bread did not look like focaccia bread and I told her to double check. Lucky we did because she was served the non-vegan buttermilk roll. The guacamole chili fries were really good! The red potato burger was just okay, nothing special. We could not try the deserts because they did not have an ingredient list. Overall we were disappointed."}
{"text":"Ugh... this place was AMAZING!  My roommate is vegan and told me about this spot one day. We finally got around to going and I have been craving their food ever since. Everything on their menu looks so good and I can't wait to get back to try it all. They have everything from breakfast sandwiches to veggie burgers to tacos. This is a great spot for everyone-- whether you are vegetarian or not you will find some satisfying and tasty food here!  On my first visit I really went all out and ordered the special which was a beet burger with fries and a brown sugar poptart (because, duh) and one of their famous biscuits. The burger was so hearty and delicious. It was made from beets and quinoa and had a slightly sweet taste and topped with a smoky poblano corn mixture. Everything from the toasted bun, to the ketchup for the fries was spot on. (Seriously the ketchup is sooo good and I don't even like ketchup normally.) Of course the poptart was delicious and perfectly flaky and the biscuit with jam & butter was out of this world.   The service was also amazing. Everyone is so happy and nice at The Coronado and you can tell they enjoy what they do and take pride in their food. Such a great spot! I would HIGHLY recommend visiting The Coronado-- vegetarian or not!  I also heard they have a great happy hour that I am planning on checking out!"}
{"text":"Good place to grab a quick lunch. Limited menu so if you are short on time and want a quick healthy but hearty vegetarian or vegan meal this is a great place. They have brunch on weekends that is supposed to be great will be giving it a try. Be sure to try the jack fruit sliders and chili! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Tacos were very bland. It was extremely crowded and service was not the best. Had high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. I ordered the cauliflower tacos. Very flavorful. I added street corn and it is UH-MAZING!!!!!!!! My husband had the red bean quesadillas. He couldn't believe that he was ordering food without meat but absolutely LOVED THEM! I'm proud of him. My friend who is vegetarian ordered the beet burger. She said the texture and flavors were awesome. I ate a piece and I really enjoyed it. My other friend had the potato burritos. She only likes meat lol so she wasn't pleased AT ALL!!!!! But overall I've VERY impressed!!!! I have zero complaints. Very friendly atmosphere. Great service! Music is great as well."}
{"text":"The fried guac was out of this world and the fresh lemonade was so refreshing!! Sitting outside and feeling the Arizona air made it even more special!!"}
{"text":"Good coffee- enjoyed my soy latte. Got the veggie scramble it was good but on the small side for the price."}
{"text":"Never thought I could love tacos without meat. Their cauliflower tacos are amazingly good! I tried a few other things as well & it was all good. Definitely one of my favorite spots to eat."}
{"text":"So apparently I am notorious for going to places just before they close, not intentionally by the way. Anyways, I arrived to The Coronado about 30-45 minutes before they closed and I'm never fond of doing that because I have that feeling of the employees being irritated or wanting to rush me. Once again I was proven wrong in a good way!  The restaurant is located right off of 7th street just north past McDowell, close to Nami and Green New American (which are also vegan/vegetarian spots that I love!), so it was really easy to find. I love the look of the building as it looks like it might've been a house at some point in time. It's quite small but I honestly love restaurants like that because it gives it a more homey feel (no pun intended).  I walked in and was instantly greeted by the cashier as she walked to the register. The setting was awesome! Dim lighting in some parts of the (house) and big abstract paintings paintings right when you walk in. It might be a personal preference but I love that coffee shop type atmosphere when I go to a restaurant. The music was chill so it matched the vibe of the place.  Moving along, so I already knew what I wanted to order, originally wanted 2 potato tacos and 1 cauliflower taco, but the cashier told me they can only do 3 taco combo.....I don't think she understood what I meant because I've seen that people have mixed different tacos from other pictures, however, I just brushed it off and got 3 cauliflower tacos without the pepitas (pumpkin seeds).  When I took the first bite..........WHAT IS LIFE!!! The tacos are SO flavorful, I swear I was eating a fish taco, but a much better version that doesn't make me bloated afterwards! The cauliflower was lightly battered and fried and it had guacamole, spinach & creamy avocado dressing. It's literally like a light version of a fish taco, almost could not even tell the difference besides it being slightly sweeter than a fish taco (by now I think you can tell that I love fish tacos). It was pretty late when I went there so unfortunately I couldn't finish all 3 tacos so I'm hoping they will still taste good warmed up. Regardless, it was delicious!  Customer service was great as well. I asked for a to go box after finishing only 1 taco so the cashier I'm guessing assumed that I felt that I needed to hurry and finish before closing time so she assured me that I didn't have to rush and that they will still be there 3 minutes even after closing if I wanted to stay. I thanked her for the offered but told her I was full already so she understood lol.  Needless to say I will definitely come back again and THOROUGHLY enjoy my food next time, and I am hoping to try the Mexican corn and chili guacamole fries, those sounded amazing as well. Stoked to find another great vegan/vegetarian spot!"}
{"text":"And the meal was awesome. I love the variety of flavors, with an Arizona twist. I've never had a teppary bean  burger and the fried guacamole Was legit!! I am happy there's good vegan options in Arizona! Portion sizes are moderate which I suppose is good if you're trying to lose weight and save animals. Cocktails and beer choices were interesting in a good way. Tried my moms cauliflower tacos and they were legit too"}
{"text":"Visiting from Seattle and friends recommend we eat here. It's a cute small place with an outdoor patio. Great menu! The food is creative and filling. I loved the dessert options- I tried the rose water & pistachio scones and Mexican dark chocolate cookies. The best part- the prices are very reasonable. We wanted to go back a second time before leaving town!"}
{"text":"This place. So rad....booze. Beer. Wine. Coffee. But seriously...the fricking cauliflower tacos. Holy moley Batman! Those are the bomb. OMG. Soooooo good! Go there just for those. But yeah beyond that, its cozy, handsomely appointed in just the right style and!!!! there's a dog friendly patio. Excellent service and style. The prices aren't crazy and for what you get....shoot man...worth every dang penny. Tip good because the staff there are friendly, courteous, and very very cool. Good people."}
{"text":"I came here for a breakfast burrito which I heard was very good. ordered it and took about 28 mins to get my food. Excited to finally eat i dove in. the burrito was very cold as if it sat for the whole time I waited. I asked to speak to a manager. let the mgt know about my situation the long wait and the cold food. She was only willing to give me 10% off my meal. I wasnt there for a discount just wanted a hot meal and was very frustrated after waiting 28 mins to get it. this is not how to treat customers. I am very let down by this place and will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a small Vegetarian/Vegan restaurant in an old house. There is seating inside and outside, although it is fairly small so it  fills up fast. You stand at the bar which is located in a room just off the front door and order your food as well as pay for it when you order. Then you select your own table (if you are lucky enough to find an open one!) and they bring your food to you. We were fortunate as someone was leaving right when we walked outside on the patio.  The food was amazing! Seasoned so well that we did not even need to add salt! The cauliflower tacos were our favorite, although the potato tacos were a close second. You can choose regular cheese or vegan cheese sprinkled on them. The beet burger was delicious as well and I loved that it had the crunchy fried onions on it.  This is not a fancy place but to me - that was part of the charm. Even if you are a meat eater - you will still love this place!  You may just decide to eat vegan/vegetarian more often!!"}
{"text":"The cauliflower tacos were super duper good. This is a place where you order at the counter then have seat and they'll bring your food out to you. Good luck finding utensils; they're not by the counter, but in another room. Good thing I had a Kleenex in my bag! I'm not sure how the service was because there really isn't any."}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin. First the food itself was tasty flavorful and well cooked. Had the brunch menu biscuits and gravy. the biscuit was perfectly cooked fluffy not dry . The mushroom gravy was to die for earthy peppery nice consistency. But for 10 something a plate I expected a little more bang for my Buck . The gravy was sparing and dish had no sides with it . The avocado toast had this amazing avocado pesto and greens on the side a very tasty flavorful light snack but for nine dollars a plate it also was lacking in portion size one piece of toast and half a cup of mixed greens would cost me 3/4 of the price to duplicate at home. Again for 9 something I expected at least two pieces of toast and a bigger salad.  Now the wait time was ridiculous the ordering process ridiculous. Waited twenty minutes in line ordered at a counter was given a number. Seating was sparse and what was available was family style seating on long picnic tables on the patio. When informing the wait staff about seating issues we were told to ask to share .My daughter proceeded to ask a number of patrons in family style patio seating who were sitting in groups of two or three if they would mind sharing and got shot down several times . We opted to get our order to go and waited thirty more minutes for our food. It was a very aggravating and uncomfortable experience for overpriced food."}
{"text":"This restaurant did not disappoint! Their vegan menu is plentiful and they offer more options on the weekend for brunch. My sister and I shared the biscuits and gravy and the cauliflower tacos. So delicious!! I haven't had good vegan biscuits and gravy until I came here. It's small and quant, so expect to wait a little bit for a table- but trust me it's worth it! The employees were super friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, delicious and creative menu. Quick ordering and friendly staff. A  favorite \"go to\" place when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here four times and four times I've ordered the Red Bean Quesadilla. What makes this dish the one I \"go to\"? It's the fact that I can get the amazing cheesiness with red beans and no cheese. The drinks are top notch as well.   It's crowded and busy but it's worth it all."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their cauliflower tacos and would highly recommend it to anyone that's going to this restaurant. It's like a paradise for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute. Love the vibe. Came in right when they opened for breakfast and ordered a vegan option. They were out of tofu so she refunded me the breakfast and offered a different option on the house. Super nice. Great service. And REALLY good cold brew!"}
{"text":"Good to have another vegetarian restaurant with many vegan options.   Creative menu and tasty HORCHATA!"}
{"text":"if the food wasn't so salty, i'd give it five stars! vegetarian/vegan mexican restaurant options are so rare. try the fried guacamole!!!"}
{"text":"Cauliflower tacos and potato tacos were superb :D Great service and strong drinks"}
{"text":"I'm thrilled to say that this is one of my favorite places. Outdoor seating that's dog-friendly and intimate indoor seating, the Coronado is intimate while still feeling relaxed. It's got a pastry case, has great beer and the cauliflower tacos are one of the best things I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant I have been to in a long time. It is very cute with a very comfortable atmosphere. They also have a dog friendly patio. The only thing that would make it better is more seating. We had the fried guacamole, cauliflower tacos and chili guacamole fries. Everything was fantastic. Even my meat eating husband was raving about the food. We got some desserts before we left; a hibiscus cookie sandwich, a walnut brownie and a salted peanut butter blondie. The blondie was WAY too salty and pretty dry, the brownie was good, but the cookie was incredible! We ended up buying two more. Even if you aren't vegan or vegetarian, The Coronado won't leave you disappointed. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today with a girlfriend that I had been talking about this place with for awhile. We are both vegetarians so we were happily surprised with how difficult it was to choose something off the menu. The staff was really nice and helped with some recommendations and showed us the ropes since it feels a little confusing when you first get there. My friend ordered the Huevos Rancheros and although she thought they were a little small in portion for the price, she said they were really good. I ordered the Jackfruit Sliders, but vegan-style so they put it on one big focaccia instead. It came with fries and a unique cinnamon ketchup-type sauce. It was delicious and vey filling! My friend and I shared some of it. Cute little place and I will definitely be back to try the pastries that looked really unique and good. Only took away a star for the confusion in ordering, the time difference between when they brought my friends meal and mine, and the chai tea latte I got which was only okay."}
{"text":"For my 1st time at The Coronado I had the yummy Goat Cheese and Jalape√±o Marmalade Quesadillas. Sweet & SPICY, but sooo good. I definitely needed a break between each slice because my mouth was burning but I would order again.   I went at around 12pm on a Sunday and it seemed busy. The place is small and I would say there's was definitely some limited inside seating during this time. There is seating in the patio but come one, on a sunny Phoenix afternoon no one wasn't to sit outside even with the misters on.   I've heard great things about the potato tacos so I would like to go back and try those"}
{"text":"Vegetarian comfort food is hard to come by, but the Coronado does a great job at it. On top of their great menu (which also includes breakfast all day), the drinks (both caffeinated and alcoholic) are supreme. The staff is friendly as well.   It's a great place to study with WiFi, lots of table space and small side rooms to keep noise down."}
{"text":"Omg I love the Coronado!!! I don't live close but I get it quite often when I get the chance. I usually always order the chili guacamole fries, sometimes with a fried egg on top. Then the delicious cauliflower tacos. Yummmm. The bakery treats are pretty tasty as well. I also like getting the tofu scramble. So good. I would definitely recommend this place to vegans, vegetarians or anyone that would like to eat a bit healthier."}
{"text":"The reviews so far are spot on. The biscuits and gravy are phenomenal and the staff is kind and attentive. What you may not notice is the amount of love and care that goes into this place. There is such an incredible amount of attention and love in every piece of the Coronado, do yourself a favor and forego another picture of your food on Instagram and look around yourself and take in the soul of this place, it's exceptional."}
{"text":"Such a cute spot to grab a bite to eat. The cauliflower tacos were bomb, and the person I went with had the potato tacos and he said they were great.  We shared the fried guacamole which was delicious and perfect for two to share.  Excited to come back to try their breakfast and coffee next!"}
{"text":"I am vegan and I have tried many vegan restraints (especially in az) and this is by far the best yet!!!! Super friendly staff, a+ menu selection, super cute atmosphere, very time efficient (considering the size) and all over everyone we super helpful and the food was delicious! Definitely going to come back and try everything on the menu"}
{"text":"AMAZING yummy beet burger!!  I really enjoyed this burger. My husband and I split it and the red potato garbanzo burger. The fries were amazing and the environment was beautiful. We really enjoyed our time there.   The red potato and garbanzo burger def could've been better. That keeps it from 5 star.  The vegan bread was amazing so tbat did help it.   Overall great experience. Friendly staff and if i visited Arizona again, id def go back to try something new. The guacamole looked amazing."}
{"text":"I came to use my second Groupon and I was happy to find out they are open until 11 on Friday! I came after I got off work and I ordered online through Eat 24. Super easy to order and I chose cash as my payment option since I was paying with a Groupon.   I chose 9pm as my pickup time and arrived a few minutes afterwards. The young lady working was very friendly and patient as I pulled up my voucher and my food was packed and ready for me. Super easy to redeem and I got a Mexican hot chocolate cookie, because who can resist fresh baked treats?  I ordered the street corn, which I would pass on for next time. I love corn on the cob but I think the charred aspect wasn't jiving with me. The potato tacos are delicious, love that they come with lime to add some zing to it. And the quesadillas were sweet, savory and spicy all in one, just like I like it.   This is a great place to dine in or carry out, and their menu has lots to choose from!"}
{"text":"So good! This has become one of my list of vegan places my boyfriend and I eat at when we visit Phoenix. We ordered the breakfast burrito with tofu instead of eggs, the biscuits and gravy, and the Tahini Brussels sprout Caesar salad. Our favorite dish was definitely the salad! I ordered the prickly pear iced tea; it came unsweetened and wasn't bitter! We are looking forward to coming back and trying more items on their menu! You can tell a lot of locals enjoy this place, whether you're vegan or not."}
{"text":"... Yeah whatever Ashley, go back to Hawaii will ya! The Coronado is solid in service and quality of food. I love it. And for the cats who throw shade, man don't come back, more room and food for me, fo sho, fo damn sho."}
{"text":"I visited The Coronado with some friends last week and enjoyed some delicious (soy) chorizo tacos, and a yummy carrot cake cupcake. It's a small space but it's definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Amazing. We stopped for breakfast on a Wednesday. Super chill and friendly staff! Delicious food. Will be back next time in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Great vegan food and tremendous service.  Nice afternoon spent having lunch on the dog friendly patio. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We have mostly loved the food here, but the place is kinda quirky.  Pros:  - Plenty of parking, but enter slowly because there's a huge bump that needs to be regraded in this dirt/rock lot and lower cars may bottom out - Cute interior - Friendly staff (that may or may not be hopped up on espresso so be prepared to be shouted at drill sergeant style when you walk in) - Close to the best vegan baked goods in town (if they have cherry \"pop tarts\" and that's your thing try one) - Creative menu - Nice food presentation (dine-in) - Good for takeout, but know your vegan substitutes and double check them  Cons: - The space IS NOT big enough to do the order at the counter and find a table thing like other places do successfully, so after you order and get your tabletop number stand there may not be a place to sit.  - Due to the above, when you dine-in you may feel rushed because of the groups of people wandering through the tiny rooms trying to gauge how close you are to finishing your meal.  - Service is slow. - Buns aren't vegan and must be substituted out for focaccia or whole grain bread - double check all substitutions, especially with takeout. - They served charred, inedible street corn in a takeout order, which tells us food quality standards aren't a big deal to the kitchen staff - again, double check all orders. - If you get coleslaw on the side with a sandwich for takeout the bottom of your bun/focaccia/whole grain bread will be soggy. - They don't serve decaf espresso drinks for health and environmental reasons, despite there being alternatives."}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian, and typically love places like these. I found a Groupon, and was really excited to try this place out. First off, you seat yourself and order at the bar. After you  order you pay at the counter with square which prompts you to tip 15 percent, 20 percent, or 30, which made me really uncomfortable when I am expected to get my own water and silverware. As far as food, we ordered coffee, alcohol, an appetizer, and four entrees. My son's avocado sandwich and my moms meal were brought out 10 minutes before the appetizer. We ordered my son's sandwich with no spinach but they added it anyway. I picked it off. He started complaining right away that his root beer smelled bad, and after smelling it myself it was clear that the glass was unclean, and smelled musty.   They added sauce on my husband's after he asked them not to, and when we complained they said oh well the guy taking the orders is new. After our meal i mentioned that the root beer smelled really badly and the bartender smelled it, admitted it smelled bad, but didn't really care and acted indigent. I ended up spending over fifty bucks for lunch, and no one left happy. Avoid avoid  avoid."}
{"text":"Normally, it's really super duper awesome food. That should be the only reason to ever come here. But customer service has never been good... possibly decent if the counter person is someone new and they haven't been indoctrinated to being a bitch. I've been here more than 30 or so times and each and every time, the counter person is always rude, arrogant, and pretentious with holier-than-thou smug look and attitude. Tonight... when I'm really hungry and not in the mood to tolerate shitty attitude, this was the straw the broke the camel's back. I mentioned I had a burger before but don't remember what it was and the counter person said it probably was the red potatoes/garbanzo but suggested the beet burger and I'm not into it. I asked if I could get crispy onions that normally would come on the beet burger to be placed on the red potatoes/garbanzo burger and the counter person said No! In an offended way and flustered while she talked down to me saying that I should have the food the way it's made because everything is paired perfectly the way it is. Ok, I wanted to walk out then and there. Ummm... if I'm paying for something, would it fucking kill you to put onions on burger for me since I like onions?! I ended up ordering the breakfast burrito instead and just wanted to have something to refuel. Seriously, what ever happened to customer service?! I hate how vegans are so damn smug. You can take your Marxist attitudes and shove it. This is another place that's gone wrong."}
{"text":"Delicious! Who knew that vegetarian food could taste so good!  I had the Red Potato & Garbanzo Burger , this was one of the best burgers I ever had! SOOOO GOOD! Oh and hand cut fries with homemade ketchup really take it to another level. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I recently took my family here, because I have some vegan cousins that were in town, and I thought the menu (especially the potato tacos) sounded awesome. The potato tacos were actually just really crispy little potato squares, without any sauce really, wrapped in a crappy corn tortilla. The deep fried guacamole looks like a little turd on the plate in the middle of some chips, and the drinks were so so. It's just not a good place to sit and eat with people, because there is not a lot of room, and you order at the coffee counter. I've heard it is an awesome coffee shop, but I would stick to that. It just wasn't at all what I expected."}
{"text":"Goat cheese quesadillas to die for.  It's great to never worry about not having quality ingredients.  They do an excellent job creating menu items with unique and healthy ingredients."}
{"text":"Good food, better desserts. Definitely will go back again. Staffs also been very helpful"}
{"text":"Just had lunch here and I am in love! I am newly vegetarian and eating out is tricky! Especially since my boyfriend is still an omnivore. We both will be eating here again. My boyfriend said the chorizo tacos were amazing and he couldn't tell the difference from the real thing! I had the avocado sandwich and it was so flavorful. Their fries have a hint of sweetness and I LOVE it!! Vegetarian/vegan or not, this is a great place to eat!   Only con is parking. Frisky parking if you ask me! Lol"}
{"text":"A small little vegan hipster joint with fantastic cauliflower tacos and excellent elote. I've heard the pop tarts are outstanding as well so I'll have to go back and try one.  The bean burger and fries were also good, as was the hummus.  The potatos were a bit dry in the potato tacos so we were not a fan of those."}
{"text":"Didn't really enjoy our visit here for a number of reasons.  1. Menu was limited. A total of ten items available at dinner. Only five available at breakfast. A lot of it fried. I found the potato tacos to be dry. The chips with the guacamole were chewy. The salad was expensive for what it was.  2. Went during Happy Hour and the beer I got was $5+tax and served in a 10?oz glass. I'd hate to see how much that little beer would cost during regular hours.  3. Came with our 18-month old. No highchairs.  Space is nice, both indoors and out; service was good. Patio is dog-friendly."}
{"text":"It's exciting when a new vegan/vegetarian place opens in Phoenix, so when I was back home over the holidays I decided to stop in with friends. The good morning sandwich I ordered was really good, the agave mustard was a nice touch.  One point of suggestion I brought up to the woman behind the counter was the fact that the coronado up charges for non-dairy milk. I found this to be really off putting from a restaurant that is trying to support the vegan community. I told her I would rather pay more for every single coffee drink (as a flat rate like most vegetarian/vegan places) on the menu than be charged extra for being vegan. An extra fee for being vegan is something I'd expect from a restaurant or coffee shop that doesn't understand the vegan culture or community.  Also, wondered where the cow diary is sourced from, not that I eat it, but as a customer who is supporting this restaurant. With a little tweaking The coronado could be a really awesome spot not only for vegetarians but vegans too :)"}
{"text":"Solid place. I got the red potato and chick pear burger, and my boyfriend got the beet and quinoa burger. They were both really good, however I think adding something like grilled mushrooms and maybe even avocado would make it a lot better! It just needed more. It was also a smaller sized portion.   Ranch would also be good with the fried :)"}
{"text":"Will never come here again and I didn't even get to eat! Came here on a Saturday morning and it was understandably busy but not with people eating but   People lounging. I was trying to find a table to eat but there weren't any to be found. But if you want to sit on a Saturday morning and take up a whole table to do homework with just a drink you found the place! The staff were not interested in accommodating us but were very happy helping those coffee drinkers."}
{"text":"I was with friends at the heard museum and the cafe there was closed. We found Coronado on yelp and went there because it was close. I liked the looks of the place. But our order took 1 hour to get ready, and it wasn't that busy. One of my friends had to leave before because we didn't realize it would take that long, so she couldn't even try her meal. When it finally arrived, the waitress was completely lost. She couldn't say what the dishes were, we had to figure it out by ourselves by opening the burgers and sandwiches. After we were done eating, she comes back with another plate asking if it was ours   I liked the food, but it's not worth the waiting."}
{"text":"Had the cauliflower tacos and they were INCREDIBLE!!! Not only were they vegan tastiness, but huge portion (for a great price)! We were able to share and left more than satisfied. Would love to return and try other stuff on the menu!"}
{"text":"Had The Evergreen drink (yummy and spicy) ... cauliflower tacos and potato tacos... So yummy.  Sat outside listening to beautiful live music.  The tacos were so good, the sauce on each one was sooo tasty.  Such a good vibe.  Couldn't get any better!"}
{"text":"This lovely restaurant is owned by the former owners of Brags Pie Factory. I love the feel of this new restaurant & the dishes here are even better than those at Brags (if that's possible)  We don't get into the city too often, but I am so happy we can make a quick stop by when we are here. The avocado sandwich is wonderful & the tacos are amazing. I love the creativity of their dishes & my only regret is that I don't live closer"}
{"text":"Walked in around 2pm  on a Tuesday. It is counter service but felt more like table service! Thank you! I had the jackfruit sliders they were so flippin good! I could have used a little less mayo? or dressing but honestly I had a delightful time."}
{"text":"The Coronado is sooo good! I'm not a vegan or vegetarian but it doesn't matter. You won't miss the meat! The potato tacos and goat cheese quesadilla-yum! Also, leave room for the pastries...do not miss the chocolate brownie with chili and orange. It is quite extraordinary. The people behind the place are super cool and the servers and baristas -top notch. The cafe is inside a great house and still has that homey-chill out vibe. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Came across The Coronado by accident, after finding that my original pick was closed. Very fun place, with plenty of earthy vibes. Seriously delish food for veggies and non-veggies alike. We wound up coming back for a second bite before the end of our trip, by request of the meat-eating mother. I ordered the tofu chorizo tacos and fried guacamole the first trip, and the potato tacos the second trip.  Totally worth the second trip. Can't wait to visit next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Vegan. Vegetarian. Say these words and you're sure to get different reactions from different people. Some might swoon, others scoff, but everyone has an opinion about this eating lifestyle.    Me? Well, I try to hate everyone equally, so that said, I tend to be a scoffer...    Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate this lifestyle. Whether it's chosen for health reasons or compassion, I think it can be a noble cause. The problem is that as with all things, there's always a group of people who tend to ruin it for the rest.   You know the ones. They smugly flash their veggie-ism in others faces with an attitude of superiority. Constantly trying to convert others because their way is the \"best\" way...   That said, when the lady-person wanted to check out The Coronado, and I saw it was a Veg restaurant, well obviously I scoffed. Then of course I agreed... because I like food.   The restaurant appears to be a converted home and borders the Historic Coronado neighborhood. I would assume this has something to do with the name. I will not research whether or not that is true.   We went inside and the interior seemed cozy, eclectic and charming. They have a full bar, a small, but diverse local draught beer selection and coffee. You order inside at a counter, get your drink, a number and then they bring the food to your table when its ready.   I didn't expect much from the food. I was really just along for the ride. We got the red potato & garbanzo bean burger with fries, the fried guacamole and the cauliflower tacos.   When everything arrived, the first thing I noticed was that the presentation was well done. The food looked great, but then tasted even better. The fried guacamole slightly edged out the other items as my favorite. The tortilla chips were excellent. They tasted like they were baked rather than fried. They were thick and crisp not like typical thin tortilla chips.   The amount a flavor in all the food was impressive. I didn't expect to be such a fan. If this is what good vegetarian food is like, I could easily eat it on a regular basis.   We also got a couple of baked goods before we left. A cupcake and some kind of a brownie. I've had a vegan cupcake before and was not happy about the experience, but this one was on another level. It had a little kick of spice and was nice and moist. So delicious.  If any vegetarians want some company going around preaching the gospel of veggie-ism, you let me know and I'll join you... at least until I feel like having a steak."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! The service is impeccable, always. The food is fresh and flavorful. The cauliflower tacos are my favorite along with the fried guacamole. Their daily specials on their homemade poptarts are amazing as well. Love the lattes."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have come here a handful of times, I have not had one bad experience here due to the fact that their food is amazing and so delicious. The restaurant is basically a house so it's kind of close quarters and is the main reason why my girlfriend and me prefer to sit outside. We haven't had to wait long for our food so that's a major plus. We recommend it to people and I'm just waiting to go back to grub on some more food."}
{"text":"A solid 3/5 for my first visit. I will probably try again and see if my next experience is better (or worse). It would be 5/5 if this was a strictly food-based review.  The set-up is.. awkward. Like the whole hip-restaurant-in-a-historical-house theme all over this city is cute, but in this case it's.. jarring. The rooms are small, including the one with the order counter, so when it gets busy it becomes very crowded in there.  I ordered the goat cheese & jalapeno marmalade quesadilla and it was everything I wanted it to be. Very good!   Except I didn't have my drink through the first half of my meal. I had ordered an iced tea. I guess the drinks are made by the cashier, but she was busy trying to serve the line of people that formed in front of her after I ordered. So a guy brought out my food, and I waited a couple minutes.. no sign of tea. I got about half-way through and went back up to the front to ask about my tea. The cashier was apologetic and clearly overwhelmed (I felt kinda bad about it!).   Once your drink is ready, you have to pick it up at the counter (unlike the food, which is brought to you).. this is awkward when there's a huge crowd waiting to order. Not only that, but if I hadn't been very close to the front of the restaurant, I might've had no idea that my drink was ready. I could have waited by the counter, but I had a plate of food. This system works in some places, like Jobot - because their building is basically one big open space. So anyone can hear their drink order be called out and see it on the counter. In this restaurant, it's a lot harder to make it work effectively, because it's a bunch of different rooms.  Again, food was good. I was just kind of weirded out by the way their 'system' works. It seems like it could be done in a way that isn't so inconvenient.  Maybe i'll just use postmates next time.."}
{"text":"Such a comfy and delicious place. Favorites include the quesadilla, street corn and the sliders. The cilantro sauce is amazing! The salad is light and refreshing. I haven't had a dessert yet that I didn't like, either. Glowing recommendation, please give this place a try if you haven't! Plenty of vegan options."}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time with my better half. The avocado toast was great! Simple yet filling. Enjoyed the bottomless coffee and the atmosphere. Will definitely be back to try the vegan pastries and other delicious looking menu items."}
{"text":"Great place to hangout for drinks and food. So far all dishes have been amazing, their corns dish and cauliflower taco is my favorite."}
{"text":"I ordered the potato tacos and they were good! The potatoes were seasoned perfectly! I will be coming back to try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"What a fantastic spot!  As a vegan, I appreciate any spot that has a lot of options for me, and this place really does deliver. It's also a really great option for non-vegan friends to tag along because of the vegetarian options as well.   Here's what we ordered:  Fried Guacamole: So good! We were practically fighting over the last few bites.  Chorizo Tacos: Super yummy!   Avocado Toast: Pretty simple avocado toast, nothing revolutionary or special about it, but still delicious.  Good Morning Sandwich: Kinda small, but my meat loving brother enjoyed it!  Peach Pie Muffin: I can't even think of words, it was so delicious! Very moist, and again, we were fighting for the last few bites of this one!"}
{"text":"a very disappointing experience. I had a squash burrito that was soaked dripping in oil. I don't think there was anything else other than the fat tortilla. my friend had a salad that was mediocre at best. all the former ambiance of the last two establishments is now gone. if you're going to do vegetarian, you might want to take a look at your competition down the street, Greens. they pack it in."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a road trip and loved it! Such great vegan options and a nice, chill vibe. Dog friendly patio and good brunch options. I recommend the cauliflower tacos"}
{"text":"My Wife and I came here last week for a late lunch.  You see, Junior was out of town on a school trip and my wife took the week off, so we had a \"staycation\" and were able to enjoy some restaurants we don't normally get to, The Coronado being one of them.   9 months ago, we decided to try a Vegan diet. I'll spare the details, but it's been a great choice for us.  My Brother and Sis'-in-law got us a gift card for this establishment for Christmas, and we finally made it down to try it.   For those that have not been there, The Coronado is located in a small renovated house on the N/E corner of 7th Street an Monte Vista.  Being that we went at an off time, we had no problem parking in the dirt lot on the north side of the restaurant.  I'd describe the interior as eclectic and hipster modern.  When you enter the front door, the counter/drink area is off to your left.  We were greeted by the young lady behind the counter and told that we order at the counter, and our food will be brought out to our table.    My Wife and I grabbed a table in the back room and checked out the menu.  We kept going back and forth between tacos and burgers; we decided on the latter.  We went up front to the counter and ordered our meals, the Tepary Bean Burger with fries for my wife, and the Red Potato Garbanzo Burger with salad and a side of fries (we are on staycation after all...) for me and 2 iced teas to drink.  We also selected the focaccia bread as the vegan option over the buttermilk bun.  The young lady at the counter brought us our teas (they are made fresh when you order) after a few minutes.  Another server brought out our food a couple of minutes after the teas.  Both the burgers looked hidden under the focaccia bread, but the salad and the homemade fries (long thick cut) looked great; it was at this point that I noticed my burger was slathered with mayonnaise.  I purposely selected the Red Potato and Garbanzo burger because of the 3 burgers listed on the menu, it's the only one without mayo, yet here I am looking at a thick spread of mayo (vegan or otherwise, I don't like mayo) peaking out at me from under the focaccia.    Well...as I've stated before, I don't send food back, ever; and even if I wanted to, the server was nowhere to be found.  She had dropped off our food and disappeared at almost light speed.  So...I made do with what I had and tried to enjoy my burger.  Both burgers were tasty, but crumbly which is understandable considering what they are made from.  My wife liked hers, and from what I could taste of mine, it was quite good; unfortunately the mayo not only hid the flavor of the burger, but also the agave mustard which was disappointing.  I also don't think that focaccia bread is a great choice for a vegan burger, since it's more dense and harder than the burger it's supporting; try getting some soft vegan rolls, other restaurants do it.  As I mentioned above, the french fries were home made and thick cut.  They looked wonderful and were seasoned nicely.  However, they were not cooked long enough.  They were flaccid.  A little more time in the fryer, and they would have been much better.  The catsup served on the side did have a very nice flavor.  The side salad I had with my burger was the high point of my meal, the dressing was light and very tasty.  The mixed greens were fresh and so were the tomatoes.  When we had finished our meals, yet another person showed up to take our plates.  No one checked on us while we were eating to see if we needed anything, no refills of our drinks were offered.  We left; full, but unsatisfied.    Before our visit, we had no idea of the controversy involving the owner of this restaurant, we simply had a gift card and wanted to try a new stop on our vegan journey.  My advice to the owner...spend more time in your restaurant overseeing your staff and making sure they can properly prepare, cook, and serve the food on your menu and less time trying to drive away half the population from your establishment."}
{"text":"Hip vegan spot!  Tasty food, great coffee, and a rude food runner that seriously needed to take a chill pill. This place has it all!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fun ambience, creative and delicious food, hidden gem. I am neither a vegan or vegetarian, but am open minded and willing to try new foods. The food here is very very good. The staff was very helpful and offered recommendations as well as descriptions of each dish. So far I have sampled the jack fruit sliders, cauliflower tacos, goat cheese and jalape√±o marmalade quesadillas, farmyard vegetable scramble, chorizo tacos, potato tacos and peanut butter chocolate french toast. So far, everything has far exceeded my expectations, but I will give a shout out to the potato tacos, jack fruit sliders, and goat cheese with jalape√±o marmalade quesadillas. I am anxious to try the remaining sandwiches. I would recommend this place to ALL food lovers."}
{"text":"I like smaller towns and local places. Not that I haven't enjoyed a chain restaurant but there's something homey about local places that I miss living in the larger Phoenix area. Finding The Coronado has really made me feel better about living in this big city. It's charming inside where we ordered and surprisingly quiet on the patio despite there proximity to a busy street. It's close to many downtown attractions. I ordered the cauliflower tacos which were amazing. I loved the crunchy batter on the outside! My friend got the potato tacos and loved the spicy sauce. We shared a plate of fries. I will say, I'm not a ketchup girl. I usually eat my fries straight but I tried there ketchup and I'm not sure what's in it but if they bottled it, I'd buy it! Bonus points for the patio being dog friendly. We both work at a veterinary clinic and brought my friend's dog, Wren, with us. Wren gives 5 paws up for all the love and attention the staff gave her. We will be back! Follow The Coronado on Instagram if you want to see all the amazing food they make!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place, all vegan/vegetarian menu plus a coffee house, thought this would be my new spot. However, it was a bit disappointing. When I first walked in, it was extremely chaotic. It was hard to figure out where to order and seating is scattered inside and outside. I felt claustrophobic inside but the outside patio was spacious with large picnic tables. Maybe, it just happens to be busy on Sunday morning during the brunch hours but I definitely can't see myself getting work done in this environment. Also, my friend was able to locate only one outlet inside.     Now for the food, I decided to get one of each tacos: cauliflower, potato, and chorizo which they were happy to accommodate my request even though its not on the menu. I'm sure the potato tacos would have been really good if they weren't under cooked however, they were seasoned well and cut to the appropriate size. The chorizo taco was my least favorite, the only good part was the sauce. I got it with eggs, maybe its better with tofu. Lastly, the cauliflower taco was the only taco that made me say, Yes! Thank you for turning out right. The cauliflower was seasoned well and served with spinach. My friend got the chorizo tacos and she wasn't too happy with hers either.   While ordering, there were two treats in the display that caught my eye: the chocolate truffle, and the orange-chile brownie. I decided to go with the brownie and it was Ah---mazing! The brownie was dense with a kick of spice. The cream cheese and granulated sugar garnish complemented the chile brownie. It was the  best part of my meal.   I would probably return for their sweet treats and coffee/tea when it's not so busy and maybe give their potato tacos another try."}
{"text":"Best coffee I've had in the US (I'm an nyc resident).  The cauliflower tacos were yummy and the breakfasts were delicious and healthier than I expected.  Phoenix surprises with its abundance of vegan/veg options.  The service and staff were muy excelente!!  Gracias!!"}
{"text":"Refreshing cocktails especially the The Dayton, lovely summer drink. The cauliflower tacos are awesome, order the Chili Guacamole Fries!"}
{"text":"Amazing visit! We told them it was our first time and they sent us treats on the house  Great foood!!!! Very nice service!!!!!! Since it was our first time they gave us recommendations on what to order! The fried guacamole and chips is amazing! Plus the street corn! Atmosphere was very cozy and eclectic ! Will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"My friend and I checked this place out based on the cookie sample we got at their booth in the Scottsdale VegFest.  The people in that booth were nice.  Unfortunately our restaurant experience could've been so much better but it was just ok. Cool ex-house turned restaurant though.  We were rushed through the line during Sunday brunch and when my friend asked whether they could add vegan cheese the girl taking her order got slightly preachy about how they don't serve any processed fake cheeses or meat.  A simple \"sorry, no we don't\" would've been better.  Oh and by the way if you serve regular cheese isn't that just as processed as cheese made from nuts? Anyway I had the tofu veggie scramble with charred pea pods.  My friend had the breakfast sandwich which she said was a little dry, probably because the biscuit was too big compared to the filling and they don't use any of that \"processed\" cheese, butter or mayo to add moisture.  The desserts in the case did look good, but we ended up not buying any."}
{"text":"All vegetarian. Was happy to finally visit this place. Very cute little place, the waitresses are very sweet. Was super bummed we missed breakfast, but lunch was fine .. It was noon :-). I think this place is of course still figuring out a few kinks as they are new. Out of the jackfruit sliders which was a super bummer. I got the potato tacos which was a HUGE portion. It lasted me 3 meals. He got the quesadilla which was pretty thin and good, but could use some veggies inside or cabbage on top. A little thin and plain. He also got the tomato alcohol drink which was very, very tiny. I've never seen such a small amount of alcohol besides a shot. Would come back. The food is great but the alcohol is very overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome!  The food is always delicious and is reasonably priced for vegan food in Phoenix.  The desserts and pastries are delicious and always fresh.  They have a small menu, but everything is delicious.  The only downsides in my opinion are that they are sometimes out of certain menu items and they don't offer vegan cheese.  Otherwise, they are truly amazing and you can even play board games that they supply while you're eating or waiting for your food.  The employees have always been incredibly friendly and I love living down the street!"}
{"text":"Like having dinner at a friends house. Very cozy space and eclectic decorations. I will say it was a bit awkward getting seated with menus. We walked in and there was only one bartender around and she was busy helping someone out with a togo order and answering the phone while also making drinks so we finally just grabbed a menu off the bar and seated ourselves. They had a bunch of board games for us to play while we waited, that was a nice touch.  Walked back up to the bar to order since no one else came to us while we were seated, she was super friendly and informative. Great bartender. We got a beer flight and ordered our food and had to grab our own silverware,napkins,and water from a table by the door which was a little awkward having to hold all of that and walk back to your table.  Food came out about 15-20 min later, jackfruit slider and fries were awesome! Just wish they put more jackfruit and less purple cabbage. Biscuiys n gravy needs some work. Gravy tasted like cinnamon and cloves and was more sweet than hearty and savory. Husbands omelet was a little skimpy, he said it was underseasoned and needed a protein in it. The rosemary chocolate chip cookie was so so delicious.  All in all i will be back because i want so bad for vegan restaurants to succeed, being a vegan myself. I just hope they work on their recipes and their restaurant setup so that they are successful and get great reviews."}
{"text":"I cannot express how much I love this place! The ambiance of the Coronado district house turned restaurant is adorable. There are a bunch of board games to play too! The specials they have for brunch on Saturdays are great! I've loved everything I've had on the menu and that's quite a few things by now. The croissants are vegan and that's quite an amazing feet and they are out of this world delicious. I like taking non vegan people here so that they can experience this goodness and they always are so surprised by how delicious everything is! And the cold brew is top notch. It's my favorite in Phx!! Yummmmmm!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been back to The Coronado since the menu change, so I decided to drop in for a couple of things. The quaint cafe-esque atmosphere was the same and I had a reason to knock out a rosemary chocolate chip cookie. (It was staring me down, so I showed it who was boss.)  I ordered:  - $9.00 Cauliflower Tacos which are masa-battered cauliflower florets on top of guacamole, chopped spinach, pepitas, and avocado dressing  - $11.00 Red Potato and Garbanzo Burger which is a potato and garbanzo bean patty accompanied with spinach and tomato/agave mustard on a buttermilk bun.  Well...let me start by saying TC does have interesting combinations, but the food is overkill. Can't fault them there, though, because no where does the restaurant claim to serve healthy food.   My plates were tasty and comforting, but thinking of the quantities of oil consumed, it was less healthier than I prefer when eating out. I actually went home and ate a huge salad after that.  Here are my thoughts on how the dishes could be better:  I don't know why anyone would order the potato garbanzo burger with a side a fries. The patty by itself was delicious, soft, and falls apart easily. Unfortunately taste was overpowered by the thick starch-overloaded bun. The side salad I opted for was a pretty green arugula salad. It meant well, but the quantity was so small I could have easily used it as garnishment for the sandwich. Need more salad!  One thing annoyed me about the sandwich. The menu made no mention of mayo, but the cook spread mayo (vegan I presume - YUCK!) on the bun. So not only was the sandwich more oily on my tongue, it was slippery to bite into too. I wanted to slap the cook -- not for a good reason.  For anyone that doesn't like thick buns, I suggest asking if they would substitute a wrap or pita pocket. Even a lettuce wrap would be much better than that thick buttermilk thing.    As for the cauliflower tacos, once again the delivery was over done. Masa breading AND corn tortilla? Come on. The fried masa is oily and once it's cold it falls off into the guacamole (naturally oil rich). The tacos would taste much better with roasted cauliflower.   But anyway, I'm not a cook. I just eat. Three stars for the food this time around."}
{"text":"I must start by saying that I love the food at the coronado!!! However, the service is lacking. The time it takes to receive you food is atrocious. I literally came in and ordered a biscuit,jam, and eggs. 15 minutes later no food.  The excuse is there was a to go order for an order of 30 tacos. Well 15 minutes prior I was the one ordering the to go. Why did the other order take priority over mine? It is always something with the wait time aside from today. Although the food is amazing, my time is precious and don't have time to wait 20 - 30 plus minutes for something as simple as a side item biscuit and jam. Once they get more help, a bigger kitchen or better location to accommodate the thriving business I'll come back."}
{"text":"Yesterday's brunch got me like  .. First time at this cute diner hidden in the historic neighborhood of Phoenix, it specializes to the vegans and vegetarians of the valley. I ordered the delicious jalape√±o waffles cause one I love waffles and 2 indefinitely love jalapenos! I also had to snag the chili avocado fries! And of course a beer flight to wash it down with. If you ever need a Vegan place to go to this is it! They also sell yummy pastries check check it out!  #downtownphx #azfoodie #phxeats #azeats #veganeats"}
{"text":"The freaking homemade ketchup! This ketchup is pure magic (and I don't even like ketchup!) they put cinnamon or somn in it...omgggg  Their americano was also delicious. Tepary burger was fab. Red bean quesadilla was just ok in my book but my bf inhaled it so it's obvi good.  I really like the staff, music, art, and overall atmosphere here... Like Arnold Schwarzenegger, I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! I was visiting from Seattle and went in to grab something to go on Saturday night... I was having a hard time deciding and the gal at the bar recommended the beet burger with mustard. They changed the bun to make it vegan.  It was unbelievably delicious.  Try the beet burger!! I can't wait to be here again."}
{"text":"This is one the few spots my dad and I go to regularly. Service here is phenomenally friendly. They make it a priority to keep their guests happy-- if you try something new and don't like it, they'll be more than happy to fix you up with something new (usually free of cost, at least to my experience).  I recommend the fried guac as an appetizer. It comes on a plate as a decent sized ball of their own guacamole with plenty of chips. The last few times I've eaten here I ordered the avocado sandwich. The pesto in it is amazing! You get an option of coleslaw or fries too; both equally amazing. The coleslaw has apples in it which is a unique and tasty touch. The fries are nice and fat and their ketchup is insanely good with a sweet taste to it. I wanna say they make it themselves bc the consistency is a bit runny compared to others. I've also had the potato tacos, which comes with three filling tacos.  Make sure you try their baked goods!! Usually all vegan and SO SO tasty!! If they've got lemon bars: do it!"}
{"text":"Amazing stuff! I seriously wish I lived in Phoenix just for this restaurant. Everyone was very kind and willing to help us choose from the substantial menu. The barista was especially welcoming.  We had the sage-chocolate scone, apple jam muffin, tofu scramble, cauliflower tacos, biscuit sandwich, fried guacamole, and a coffee.  Pastries were delicious, I preferred the scone. Scramble was yummy and came with homemade hot sauce which was a treat. Tacos were crispy and delicious. The pepitas on top were a lovely touch. The biscuits were flaky and perfect. The fried guacamole was out of this world!!! I can't stress this more!  The coffee was warm and rich and great with a hefty, delicious meal."}
{"text":"First I'm going to plug the Veg-Friendly UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) and say herbivores in Phoenix now have a monthly event in which they can unite!   The Coronado is most definitely a comforting little cottage for everything from light bites, to coffee, to cocktails, to full meals. The pastries are regarding as quality stuff, and like the rest of the menu can be either vegetarian -or- vegan.   Here's what I had:   The Sheridan - Groovy wine and whisky cocktail that went down smooth despite obviously being quite strong. Don't let this combination of alcohols fool you, this is legit.   Goat cheese and jalapeno marmalade quesadiilla - I don't think I could finish an entire helping of this myself, but it's *great* for sharing. Very satisfying even if it is sweeter than anticipated.   Garbanzo and potato burger, with fries: OK, this is the most starchy entree known to man even if it *is* good. My buttermilk bun, an optional component that can be swapped to make this vegan, was good. The burger itself, even slathered with a delicious dijon mustard, just was too...light compared to any other veggie burger I've had. Don't get me wrong it was a good dinner, I just kinda finished it feeling as though I'd gorged myself on snack food. Alas, a plate full of pure carbs is something I did to myself. Coronado merely delivered, but at least it was tasty!   So personally I am not sure I'd rely on this for a dinner spot. But I will say I will most definitely return to sit on the lovely patio with coffee in one hand and a cold, craft one in the other. And no one will complain about dietary restrictions. Pretty cool, right?"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this place. They have coffee, pastries, desserts, and food. Most importantly, a great menu for all the vegetarian/vegans out there. Brunch is served on Saturday & Sunday, 10am-2pm. I had the small horchatte, a smooth mixture of the housemade vegan horchata & espresso. The idea of adding espresso into the horchata was surprisingly enjoyable - just a heads up that this is an iced beverage. I also tried the chorizo tacos with eggs, and was sadly disappointed. Basically, it was a corn tortilla with under-seasoned scrambled eggs. The presentation with peppers and onions topping the tacos was appetizing, yet the taste was lacking. It was a bit of a struggle to finish. Maybe opting for the tofu option would have resulted in a different outcome. They were nice enough to accommodate my friend's order of trying a chorizo, potato, and cauliflower taco all in one plate. The potatoes in the taco were undercooked. The cauliflower was on point though. I would recommend the cauliflower if you're going for the tacos. The cookies are delicious!!! I couldn't get enough of that molasses spice white chocolate cookie.   I love that there is the option to sit inside or outside. My friend and I sat outside the patio, and certainly enjoyed catching some sunshine. The walkway around the tables are very narrow. If you're lucky, the couch inside might be available for you to sit. Unfortunately, I was only able to find one plug. This is definitely not a good place to do work for an extended period of time.   They were very fast at making drinks. As I approached the counter, the barista was already making the drink for me. Be prepared to wait 20-30 minutes for your food on a busy day. I was not impressed with the food, but will stop by for their drinks and desserts in the near future."}
{"text":"So so. It's more of a hangout than a restaurant. I'll probably never go back. There are much better new eateries in the surrounding area."}
{"text":"We didn't actually get to eat. We showed up 10 minutes before closing and the waiter told us they close in ten minutes and it's too late to serve us."}
{"text":"I am so sad to give this adorable place a bad review but it was so bad. I love vegetarian food and wanted to surprise my friend with a new vegetarian place. Everything looked awesome. We decided to share some things so we got potato tacos, fried guacamole, and the monte vista sandwich. All three were bad. First of all, this is Phoenix, street tacos should not have fat store bought tortillas and the guacamole should not have store quality chips. Both were fat and heavy. The guacamole was ok but honestly you don't need to fry it, just make good guacamole. The potato tacos were bad. Instead of a mashed mixture it was chopped up fries. Same texture as the fries that came with the sandwich. The sandwich was terrible. I honestly don't know how you can't make these ingredients work but it was terrible. I don't know what they fried the zucchini in but it was bad and unnecessary. Just grill it! We basically ate the veggies out of it and took the breading off.  The baked goods looked good but we just couldn't try anything else. I hope the Coronado plays with their recipes because I want to love you but right now I can't think of a worst downtown restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food. Try cornbread and the tacos! So cool in here. Real nice atmosphere in an arts and crafts house. Great music!!"}
{"text":"We wanted to take our friends to a vegan dinner spot for a Saturday night out.  The Coronado came through for us. We had really good vegan and vegetarian (for us) dishes, great service (even though it was counter ordering), and patio seating.  The We also had amazing cookies (rosemary) and bomb Blondie peanut butter brownies.  Oh ya, and a good wine, and a spicy margarita too!  Guacamole chili fries, cauliflower tacos, red bean quesadilla, and mexican Street corn were all on point, very tasty, and presented well!  I would recommend this place even if you aren't vegan or vegetarian!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!! Love the brunch specials. I had the horchata waffle when it was on the menu and it was gorgeous"}
{"text":"Never thought I'd find myself frequently wanting to visit a vegan hot spot, but I do. Such a hidden little gem. The cauliflower tacos are my absolute favorite! I really do love this place."}
{"text":"The place was so cute, parking is small but if you arrive early you'll be fine and inside was so cute, you order at the Register first then hunch a table down and they bring you the food! My brother is vegan and I decided to come with him to try it and boy it was so good! Would definitely come back ! He ordered the Tofu Breakfast Burrito and I ordered the Pumpkin French Toast, we left very satisfied! Staff was also super friendly!"}
{"text":"Finally a vegan establishment that understands the necessity of flavoring their foods !!!!! I've never finished my entire plate from vegan places other than here. Everything I've had has been wonderful flavor same with desserts I can't wait to keep trying more !!"}
{"text":"So as promised, I bring the family the next day.  I surprise the wife with the cauliflower tacos and get a grilled squash sammich to split.  The boy orders an over easy egg.  The order comes. The wife gushes over the mouth watering sammich. But then explodes with joy when she bites into the cauliflower taco, \"OMG, this is my new favorite restaurant!\"  The boy squishes his yolk and orders a 2nd after demolishing a perfect over easy egg.  The service is joyful and fun and I think they have wizards in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Heads up! came here for the reviews and it took longer than 30 mintues just for potateo tacos and fries! not a good experience for the first time, staff said they had calls to take care of; but what about the customers here ;(. again not good experience!"}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE. Delicious vegan food, dog friendly patio, bottomless coffee with lots of alternate milk options, artistic/hipster/unique atmosphere, friendly service. LOVE."}
{"text":"The Coronado is a quaint little vegetarian restaurant right in the heart of the Coronado Historic District. It is a small revamped house that emanates a cozy coffeehouse atmosphere.  I have visited the Coronado twice before and was really impressed with the service, atmosphere, and food. I decided to take my husband there for lunch since he's never been to a vegetarian restaurant. When we first walked in, the tables and couches were full, so we decided to sit outside. This was fine since with us since Phoenix is finally coming into fall season! The patio is dog-friendly which is nice for dog lovers like myself. Ordering is done at the bar (yes, they serve alcohol!), which can be a little crowded when busy. The bar had fresh flowers by the ordering station which was a nice touch (I love plants!).  It took about five minutes for someone to acknowledge us. The employees seemed a little under pressure due to what they said were \"mess ups\".  They did apologize for the wait though. They offer delivery service and online ordering, so I'm sure that might have something to do with the somewhat chaotic vibe that I felt.  After receiving a sincere apology for the wait, I decided to order two farmyard scrambles and a goat cheese quesadilla. When the employee read back the order, it was wrong so I ended repeating myself two more times. Our food seemed like it took a while to come out but maybe it's because we started feeling the afternoon heat. Luckily they turned on the misters to keep us cool!  When our food finally did come out, our vegetable scrambles were made with tofu instead of eggs. So we had to send the order back and wait a while longer. It wasn't too big of a big deal since we were sharing the goat cheese quesadilla, which was AMAZING! The quesadilla was a little soggier than last my last visit (I prefer crispy quesadillas). The quesadilla contained goat cheese and a homemade jalape√±o marmalade. At $6, it was worth every penny!  After devouring half of the quesadilla, the Farmyard Scramble finally came out. It consisted scrambled eggs and locally grown vegetables such as green beans, squash, and sweet potatoes. Also included was a house made spicy sauce on the side that was pretty tasty.  I enjoyed the entr√©e but it was a very small portion and a little on the pricey side at $9 each.  After my meal, I decided to try some coffee: a large latte with soy milk. The employee told me that they would bring it out to me when it was ready. I waited for what seemed more than enough time for a coffee to be made. I ended up going inside to check and it was just sitting on the bar. Not really a big deal under normal circumstances, but my sole intention for visiting the Coronado this past Monday was to leave a review on Yelp! Unfortunately I must have caught them on a bad day. On the plus side, the coffee was full of flavor. Probably the best coffee that I've tasted in a long time.   Sadly, my husband wasn't too impressed with the customer service or food so it probably won't be a place that I will frequent with him. I will go back for two reasons: the goat cheese quesadilla and the coffee. I really think that I caught them on an off day. The Coronado has a unique atmosphere, a full bar, exquisite coffee, and a palatable vegetarian menu. I'm giving four stars instead of five because of the pricing and inconsistency with the customer service."}
{"text":"I have never been to a vegan/vegetarian restaurant as good as this. Fucking fantastic! I just moved down from Utah and they don't have shit there, now I am eating my heart out at all these wonderful places. I had the cauliflower tacos with a side of fries and my mom had the hummus plate. Everything was delicious! :) Those cauliflower tacos were soooo good!!! The seasoning and sauces and flavor were great all around. Absolutely nothing to complain about. Also had a blonde cookie/brownie thing and that was heavenly. I miss great yummy cookies and pastries and this definitely hit the spot for sure! My mom is not vegan or vegetarian and she really enjoyed all of it too! A million thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I checked out the Coronado on a friend's suggestion to meet for dinner. So glad I did. We went somewhat early about 5ish and there were a few people having drinks/snacks and chatting. Love the outdoor and indoor seating areas. The menu has a lot of options for vegans/vegetarians and I had a hard time deciding what to get. I wish I'd been hungrier to try more foods but that day I had something light the \"good morning sandwich\" which was great. My friend's ordered Red potato and garbanzo burger, chorizo tacos (I hear are super popular) and the veggie hummus plate. We all loved our food very much. Service was perfect, wouldn't change a thing, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with the menu. I like vegetarian options, but this is a vegetarian restaurant without healthy options. The one savory dish that looked appealing was chili with cornbread. It's pretty hard to mess that up. However, the cornbread was way too sweet.  It was either a pumpkin spice or honey cornbread. The jackfruit sliders were gross. If you have had fresh jackfruit before, do not get this dish. We also had the nachos.  They were the worst."}
{"text":"Reasonablt good food and even better vibe. Also has a great beer selection. I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"We came with our family for lunch and enjoyed our experience in this cute house. The our specials were very good. We really enjoyed the cauliflower tacos."}
{"text":"The drinks were good, service was tolerable but this tables and bathrooms were dirty, and my sandwich was terrible. The bread was old and flavorless. There are much better vegan restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"I was here on a Sunday. I was very exited to try out this vegan restaurant. My husband and I walked in. There were about 4 empty dirty tables. There was no host and a couple waiters walked past us and did not greet or made eye contact. I assumed I had to order at the cashier. So we walked up to it. The blonde woman who was helping other customers saw us and went back to talking to them. They had already finish ordering but still chatting. I stood there. A waiter thought we were there for a pick up, I clarified and that we were there eat inside and he said \"oh\". And walked away. Finally it was our turn but the lady at the cashier ignored us. Went back to what she was doing, did not say \"Hi\" or \"Ill be right with you\". She just walked away. I stood there for another couple minutes before deciding to leave. I honestly don't know how this place has good reviews with such bad service when all the employees ignore you."}
{"text":"This is a fantastic little vegan and vegetarian spot for drinks, coffee, and food.  The place is pretty small, so seating and parking can be difficult when it's busy. It's furnished and decorated with interesting art which makes it a cool environment to be in. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Overall a good vibe, both indoor and outdoor seating with heaters outside to keep warm during winter. The bathrooms are also very clean.  The fried guacamole was interesting and rather tasteful. It was more of a try once type of thing for me but I'm sure plenty of people will fall in love with it. The cauliflower tacos on the other hand totally won me over. They're the best vegan tacos I've had in Phoenix. Be sure to ask for a side of cilantro to throw on top of the tacos. The ketchup that cane with the fries was interesting. It seemed as if they added cinnamon or something. It wasn't exactly my cup of tea. Not a big coffee drinker but it seems like this is one of the more popular small coffee shops around town."}
{"text":"Super awesome place. I had the goat cheese and jalape√±o quesadilla, and it was so delicious I couldn't believe it. My wife had the biscuits and gravy with a side of potatoes and loved them as well. Delicious treats and lattes as well. Service is prompt, friendly and kind. Lots of smiles.  One of my new favorite spots!!"}
{"text":"Try their fried guacamole + Cautiflower tacos and you wont be disappointed  So delicious and flavorful! I also love their sweet and Pop tart are my ultimate favorite and their coffee is very good! Love Vegan places!! Houray! For a delicious healthy spot"}
{"text":"The Coronado is a lunch time favorite! The food is amazing and though the location is small, it's a very welcoming space. If the weather is nice, I like sitting outside, though most of my lunch time orders are to go and make for a very delicious working lunch. My favorite item is the red bean quesadilla."}
{"text":"Would of taken a photo of my food, but I ended up eating it all before I even thought to write this. I ordered the red bean quesadilla...BOMB!!  Stop reading this and stop by this place asap!"}
{"text":"My husband and I discovered this place and went here when we originally planned to go to another restaurant but they were closed on Sundays  I'm really glad we went here! We both had ordered the supposedly famous jackfruit sandwich, but they were out of jackfruit so the server gave us each a free pastry to make up for not being able to order what we had wanted.  We are both vegetarian, and have dabbled in being vegan, so the menu was right up our alley. Hubby ordered the potato tacos and I got the monte vista (sp?) sandwich, and we shared the street corn. The street corn was AMAZING, but they did give our order to another couple who had ordered the same thing but arrived after us, and so we ended up eating the corn after our main meal because it arrived so late. We also both got iced horchattes (horchatta lattes) which was a nice twist.  We sat outside since it was crowded inside, but there were misters and the patio is shaded so I didn't feel hot. They allow dogs on the outdoor patio which is good to know so we can bring our dog next time. :) Overall a good experience and I'm hoping to come back and try the jackfruit sandwiches sometime soon"}
{"text":"2 stars. Because the food is outstanding I've been there twice and it's amazing every time. Even my non vegan friends and family love it. However both times I've gone the customer service from the employees have been terrible. The girls there are just one a terrible mood, too busy, and they're just plain rude. Please work on your customer service. I'd pick nami over this place 1,000 times. Nami is incredibly friendly and excited to serve you. So walk a couple steps over to nami for delicious food and great people. I'd rather starve than go to The Coronado and get treated like crap."}
{"text":"We were torn between a restaurant down the street and The Coronado & decided to eat here. Best decision ever!! We were greeted by John- who honestly made our lunch experience incredible. He is one of the owners & just such a nice guy. The food is so unique and I love that it is vegan and vegetarian friendly. I highly recommend the Beet burger or the fried guacamole. & you have to try the rosemary chocolate chip cookie for dessert!! 5 stars for sure, I'll be back again soon. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered the chilli guacamole fries and was very disappointed, the lots of fries and the chilli was just a couple beans sprinkled in and grease over fries. for 11$ I expected more so we sent them back and ordered pancakes 6.99$ and cauliflower tacos 10$ but both were much better"}
{"text":"It's great to go to a restaurant where everything on the menu looks good.  It was our first time and we ordered potato tacos and black coffee chili on cornbread.  The tasty, well spiced chili  on the sweet cornbread was perfect.  The potato tacos were amazing. Great seasoning and excellent sauce. Paired well with fresh corn tortillas.  We look forward to going back to try something else."}
{"text":"This place had the potential to be great. But there are definitely some unnecessary parts of the establishment that just leave me wanting more and something better. Also not a fan of their word-decor on the walls. Tacky. But I'll give it to them, their food presentation is great. I won't come again"}
{"text":"I am so impressed. The Coronado has a great selection of drinks and plant-based options. The breakfast sandwich and vegan bloody mary are delicious! The vegan pastries are worth trying too! It is busy on the weekends so it might take some time to get a table. Everyone that works here has a unique style and personality which brings so much life to this place. I will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"As a vegetarian I truly love this place. They have great options that make you feel like you're not missing out on anything. Everything I've ever ordered has been super delicious! The only thing I would say is that they run out of stuff often. Besides that, amazing!"}
{"text":"Love love love love love love! This place is so amazing, every dish I've tried has been delicious, the people are very nice, the ambiance is lovely and inviting. Plus the food is carcass-free which I extraordinarily appreciate. Every time I'm in Arizona I have to come here. Some cauliflower tacos sound really good right now"}
{"text":"Not a bad place, but definitely do not go during busy hours. Pretty crowded but at least the staff was very nice. We ended up sitting outside but the misters were pretty close to lightbulbs and other metal bits that were starting to rust. Might want to check on that.   I give it three stars because to me the food seemed like it was almost there, but not quite yet. It was pretty mushy in fact. It could have just been the time I have been here, though. I would be willing to try it again. :)"}
{"text":"It is past time for an update.  I have now tried almost every vegan item on their menu. Everything has been delicious and their house-made sauces are to die for!   Their breakfast sandwich and Farmyard Tofu Scramble dishes are great breakfast choices. I like the Biscuits & Gravy, but if you aren't a mushroom fan you may want to avoid because their mushroom gravy contains hella mushrooms.   For lunch, the Potato Tacos, Cauliflower Tacos, and Fried Guacamole are my absolute favorites. So much incredible flavor in all the above, and have I mentioned the sauces??!! (Vegan hack: Omit cheese from the Potato Tacos.)  The Red Bean Quesadilla is delicious, and if you're like me and don't like cheese (even vegan cheese) rest easy, as this quesadilla is queso-free. Yay!   The Red Potato and Garbanzo Bean Burger is very tasty, but vegans must remember that this place is vegetarian, not vegan, and they will NOT ask you/warn you about non-vegan items. The bread for this burger is not vegan, but there is a vegan alternative. Vegans must remember to ask for vegan when ordering, just to be safe.   Last, but not least, the desserts are now ALL vegan, and they are AMAZING! So many delicious concoctions, and all so buttery, sweet and dreamy!  No more drooling in sorrow at yummy-looking non-vegan cakes sitting next to the 1 or 2 vegan options of the day.  I hadn't had Thumbprints in nearly a decade. Their baker makes an unbelievably rich & buttery vegan Thumbprint cookie, filled with various fruit centers.   Muffins, cookies, brownies, scones, pinwheels, pop tarts, and sometimes we're blessed with whole cakes, which always sell out within hours.   It's a great hang out spot too.  Lots of board games to enjoy before or after your meal.  They host special events, like Simpson Trivia nights, too.  This is easily one of my favorite vegan spots for both dine-in and carry out.  They often have Groupon deals.  Opens early, closes late.  Follow them on social media to get info on brunch specials, dessert features, and events."}
{"text":"1 star: Cute and cozy atmosphere - I'm pretty sure it's a home transformed into a cafe  2 star: Very friendly and hardworking staff (there was only one girl at the front of house and she was quick, attentive AND nice!) 3 star: Delicious coffee - though I wasn't a fan of the horchatte  4 star: Delicious food - highly recommend the jalape√±o waffles and vegetable scramble- but the portions are not the most generous.   I saw games on the side- could be a fun midday coffee hang out spot!"}
{"text":"Great cute spot with yummy food!   I had the jackfruit sliders - lots of food here and really tasty!  The fries were hand cut and had a great salt/pepper seasoning.   One and only complaint is a relatively limited menu but I'm guessing that will change as they are brand new.   Definitely a keeper."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee, delicious pastries, friendly staff and fabulous atmosphere, what else you need to start your day! I found this place by coincidence and I usually don't review stuff, but got really impressed. Will be back again sure :)"}
{"text":"Love everything about this place!! The atmosphere, food, staff and coffee are all awesome. It is in an old house in Phoenix and is decorated so beautifully on the inside. The people working there were so helpful and friendly. I got the biscuits and gravy and an Irish cream and honey latte and both were excellent!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! The food is yummy, the ambience friendly and inviting! It's a treat every time we get to stop by to eat or just to get some drinks with friends..."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed The Coronado yet! I have been at least 5 times, and each time has been very good! The Coronado is a vegetarian restaurant from the people behind Bragg's Factory Diner (which I loved and was so upset when it closed). I was so happy to see the Bragg's people opened a new place.... and improved it with a full bar! The Coronado is a great place for coffee, drinks, breakfast, dessert and happy hour. They have a delicious cocktail that involves horchata...not sure what it's called, but it's fabulous. You can get this drink on the cheap until 7 pm.... I repeat, 7 pm!!! Hooray for late happy hours.    As good as their hh is, I think their breakfast is even better. They have an amazing egg sandwich served on a delicious flaky biscuit, topped with perfectly cooked veggies and a fabulously sweet/savory mustard sauce. I (almost) didn't miss the meat.    While your there, you have to get at least one baked good. I have had some amazingly delicious cookies and cupcakes here... the selection is always different and consistently impressive.   I highly recommend The Coronado to vegetarians and meat eaters alike!   PS 1500!!!"}
{"text":"first time here and it was yummy. my friends and i are doing a Daniel's Fast and they had plenty of options for us. Shout out to Cameron and everyone else that provided awesome service. the cauliflower tacos were a hit and the Mexican corn. I normally don't like tofu but the chorizo tacos were good as well. We'll be back even after the fast"}
{"text":"No decafe espresso for latte. They lost my business. Forced us to go elsewhere. Looked like the pastries were interesting but no decafe espresso no pastry. Ended up down the street where we found decafe and pastry."}
{"text":"My favorite vegan place in Arizona! Customer service, decor, and especially the food are all amazing!!!!!! We come here once a week, sometimes more :)"}
{"text":"I had the Huevos Rancheros here. It was amazing and very reasonably priced. I did not get coffee but would next time."}
{"text":"Friendly, cozy neighborhood feel. Had the red potato and garbanzo burger. The bun was fantastic but the sandwich was dripping in a mayo kind of sauce (where was the mustard described on the menu?) that makes it impossible to give any feedback on the patty, and dripped all over the coleslaw. And my arms. And my jeans. Next time I'll hold the sauce - or try something else."}
{"text":"I happened to be in the area and went here based on the great reviews. It's a cozy lil house converted into a restaurant. It's a fun, modern atmosphere and the staff was very friendly, knowledgable. You pay when u order at the register. I do wish there was more walking around room though, a lot of the tables are set up to the sides and only one person at a time can walk through each room, making for a lil awkwardness. I decided to go with the Cauliflower Tacos over the veggie burger. Omg it was sooo delicious they fried the cauliflower and had a avocado, maybe like mustard mix drizzled over it with sunflower seeds. I definitely want to go back and try what else they have to offer"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The staff are super friendly, and the food is DELICIOUS!! And omg, the horchatte is just ridiculous. Probably the best horchata latte I've ever had. I love the casual atmosphere, and how welcoming it feels. I look forward to coming back for happy hour and checking out the cocktails!"}
{"text":"I was kinda dismayed by the counter service at first but everyone was super helpful and guided me though my first time in. I would definitely go back. I went in expecting weird hippy vegetarian food and found really good hippy vegetarian food! So if you got someone who is afraid of this kind of food like I am, bring them here and I can't see how they won't enjoy this place."}
{"text":"The people are awesome, fabulous choice of beverages day and night, the breakfast biscuit is addicting, and the cauliflower tacos and fried guacamole are insane. If you haven't been here yet, you should certainly go! Great place to bring omnivores to as it is vegetarian but most things can be made vegan"}
{"text":"Two words: cauliflower tacos. I can't wait to come back and try other menu items, this place was fantastic. Great coffee too."}
{"text":"Cauliflower Tacos: yes ! Tasty, especially if you are a cauliflower lover. Potato Tacos: Skip, mine was dry and plain. The potato is basically chopped up french fries...with a few drops of lime dressing. Garbanzo/Potato Burger: I'd suggest a different burger, this one was underwhelming, my husband ordered it with and it looked like a plate of carbs. I'm determined to try this place again though for the other items or more cauli-tacos!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and friendly staff with a great community vibe. I love the tacos and Quesadillas but my new favorite meal there is breakfast. Great biscuits and scrambles. Generous side portions."}
{"text":"Food was delicious (cauliflower tacos highly recommended), atmosphere is cute though seating is limited. You order and pay before you seat yourself."}
{"text":"Michael was super helpful. I had the avocado toast and fries with a cold brew. Great environment and killer music. I'll be back here."}
{"text":"I really don't understand what another reviewer meant by the potato tacos being bad, they were excellent! Had a friend try one of them and she loved it as well. They were cooked perfectly and the sauce in the tacos had a good flavour and really complimented the tacos.   Also not sure why the other reviewer complained about using store-bought tortillas. This isn't some crazy authentic mexican place in the barrio that has homemade everything...not surprised by the tortillas at all. Also had the homemade lemonade and it had a really good flavour and nice tartness. Will totally be going again to try more things. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We were driving from LA to Phoenix on the day before Thanksgiving.  Almost all places we tried were either closing or closed as we got into Phoenix Metropolitan at 9 pm.  We eat vegan food most of the time, so I decided to do a vegan search on Yelp.  I called Coronado PHX to see if they were open, and to my surprise, they were still open until midnight.  We came storming over hungry and found relatively inexpensive, healthy, and tasty vegan food.  The garbanzo bean patty burger had nice blends of herbs. We also ordered chorizo taco made from tofu base that had powerful and juicy tastes."}
{"text":"For first timers (like myself) it's not immediately clear whether you should seat yourself, but you do, you can grab a menu at the counter.  The staff is amazing. I didn't catch a name from anyone, but they were way beyond helpful and kind. The woman behind the bar with glasses especially, I REALLY liked her. I wasn't sure which menu items were vegan, so I went up to ask her and she explained that their sauces are all made there and vegan. The best part? The pastries are vegan and they're to die for.  I ate the Jalapeno Waffle and a Snickerdoodle. SO SO SO good. This was the most delicious waffle of my life and I don't even care that I paid $8 for a little waffle, it was that good. Unfortunately, they were out of the Biscuits and Gravy that my mom had ordered (we walked in late morning/lunch time) so she had some avocado pesto sandwich that I don't know the name of. She said that was incredibly good, but she kept raving about how good the ketchup was. Because that item was unavailable after we had ordered, a man brought us over a box of pastries (PB and chocolate cookie, snickerdoodle and a cranberry scone). This was so unnecessary, but extremely kind and secured a return visit. Those freaking pastries will win me over each and every time. I didn't realize how close they were to Nami, but I won't be going there again after visiting here. Better parking, better staff, better atmosphere all around."}
{"text":"I came with a friend. I got the cauliflower tacos and horchatte (horchata latte). My friend got the red bean quesadilla. We both loved what we ordered and will definitely come back!  Good - friendly service - fast service - delicious food - good presentation  - community board games - Coffee  neutral - you order at the counter and they bring you your food at your seat - you seat yourself  not -so-good - not very many tables  bad - nothing"}
{"text":"I really love this neighborhood vegetarian spot! Whether you're looking for uniquely delicious breakfast fare (jalapeno waffles and a horchatte - yes, I did spell that correctly and it's exactly the beverage combo you'd expect!), fresh pastries, lunch (potato tacos!), happy hour (signature cocktails, locally sourced vino), dinner (jackfruit sliders!)... they seriously have something for everyone in your crowd to drool over and you'll never notice that it's non-carniverous! Plus, they put a lot of effort into being a welcoming community spot, so there's also some fun event going on -- DJ spinning, board games, live music, storytellers. It's just one of those places you always want to be at -- like hanging out at your best friend's home but with way better food (sorry, best friend!) If you haven't been yet, it's totally worth checking out."}
{"text":"Walked here for a quick lunch while we were at a training near by.   We grabbed some menus, grabbed a table and then decided what we wanted.   Orders are taken at the bar.  Everyone was very accommodating, even the server that wasn't on duty and was just hanging out.     Our table ordered fries and the hummus plate to start.  The fries were hand cut and came with a homemade ketchup that was a little sweet but delicious.  I thought the fries were a real bargain at $3.   The hummus plate was beautiful and full of veggies.  The squash was just lightly grilled and the carrots were served raw.   Micro beet greens garnished the hummus.   Definitely hand crafted and delicious.     I ordered the Goat Cheese & Jalape√±o Marmalade Quesadilla made with local goat cheese and  house-made jalape√±o marmalade.  I'm going to  make this at home.  Others at our table ordered the jalapeno waffles and Coronado Salad.     The raspberry tea was delicious.  I would have liked to have tried some of their cookies (and cocktails)!  Very friendly, affordable, eclectic and fun!"}
{"text":"The pastries are very delicious and so is the coffee! Food wasn't bad but not impressed!"}
{"text":"Food: I am not vegan or vegetarian (or even remotely close).I am a skeptic of any Mexican inspired food that claims to be both delicious and animal free since my compatriots love to eat even the ugliest part of an animal. Call me converted! The potato taco was DELICIOSO. I had no idea that potatoes could taste that way. Witchcraft! every single pastry I have eaten here has been perfect. they could sell this stuff in high end grocery stores and they SHOULD because this is America and our bellies demand it. Specifically - the sea salt Mexican wedding cookies & the dulce de leche filled cupcakes with meringue are delectable. I haven't eaten anything else here, so once I have I will come back and update. I usually give five stars for repeat performances.   Ambience: This restaurant is in a beautifully restored house in a historic neighborhood, so there are little nooks and crannies to explore both in and out of doors here. The decor is relaxed, clean and tasteful. Dog friendly porch included. There are theme nights with DJs and sweet music, so I am looking forward to attending one of those.  Note: I think it is important to keep expectations in order, here. The bar is small but mighty as is the staff. Good things come to those who wait, so remember you're not at McDonald's. The selections are proportional to the size of the whole operation, which is a bit on the smaller side. I say do a few things and do it well, so I am a fan of a small restaurant. Any foodie worth their salt knows that a 14-page menu is a bad sign. Though the menu is small, it is varied. It can get a bit crampy at the bar when you are ordering during high traffic times, so you might want to claim your stake at a table and take a menu with you to decide, then pop up to the bar to order when you're ready.  Edit: I am coming back to update to five stars. You can tell these owners really care about their community - locally and nationally. They team up with local vendors and have events to raise money for causes. 5 STARS!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was quaint and cozy. The food was horrible! I went with a group of people and no one was impressed with the food! My biscuit and gravy came out cold, and the biscuits where super dry. Don't plan on eating there again"}
{"text":"Oh the Coronado RULES!  They have amazing vegan food, a great atmosphere and friendly, hardworking staff that keep turning out super tasty food and drinks.  They have a dog friendly patio and they make amazing coffee, and vegan pastries and a cool place to chill and hang out.  You can play board games or color or just relax with friends and everything is perfect.  I highly recommend the fried guacamole, or the tacos and a horchatte!  Really you can't go wrong, everything I've had there is excellent, and I honestly think I've eaten every vegan option on their menu!!  Soooo good!!  HIGHLY recommended!!!!  Thanks Coronado for being there and adding great vegan food and atmosphere to the Phoenix community!!"}
