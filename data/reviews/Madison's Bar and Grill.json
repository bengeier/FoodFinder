{"text":"Based on the first review of this place, I expected more. When a restaurant hires someone to write a review for Yelp it should be at least close to accurate!  This place is a \"redesigned\" college cafeteria in a hotel lobby with food prices too high for the static and sterile dinner environment.  I've seen better bars in friends' basements and with a lot more hospitality and crowd. At 930 pm on a Friday night there was one very loud family, two couples in booths and one besides me, at the bar. The bartender/server was clueless and disappeared for a half hour at a time.... it struck me that with traffic so low, perhaps she was cooking the meals too.  Truthfully, I didn't eat the microwaved and droopy looking food .... that one couple sent back to the \"chef\" as still frozen. Plus the kitchen closed at 10pm after opening at 4pm."}
{"text":"We arrived at 6pm on Saturday August 18th and didn't get out of the restaurant until 20 after 8. 2 appetizers (tiny portions), 5 entrees (dinner menu online is not the menu they offer in the restaurant), and 2 desserts (desserts were delicious). We had 4 dinners on the table and had to wait 15 minutes for the 5th because the hamburger and fries did not get ordered with the rest of the food. Menu says it comes with cheese, but it didn't. Pasta dishes say the come with bread but it didn't (they brought it out after we asked about it). Side of fries ordered but not received until we asked about it. Coffee drinks listed on dessert menu not available because they said they don't brew coffee at night (not sure why the put coffee drinks on dessert menu). We were the only customers in the dining room, cannot understand the very long time it took for dinner."}
{"text":"Staying in the hotel, and have been eating here all week.  Excellent fast breakfast and great salads.  Clean modern decor and great service."}
