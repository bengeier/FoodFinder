{"text":"Great pizza for the price. Friendly and reliable delivery as well as call ahead ordering for kids parties. Great wings as well.

When picking up instead of delivery they give my kids cookies or other treats. Very family friendly people."}
{"text":"The very best pizza I've had in over 15 years. Gems like this are hard to find. The crust was PERFECT the toppings are FRESH the cheese blend on EVERY pizza is an ideal blend of mozzarella and QUALITY provolone. I am a former chef and know the taste of quality.  Anyone who feels that the pizza served here is not to their liking, please go back to Donato's, Pizza Hut, Domino's, or some other factory flavored establishment. You don't truly know food."}
{"text":"Overall pizza was good. I got the specialty crust. It's  thick with crunchy crumbles on the bottom. It definitely was a way to mix it up and good for a change but it became extra greasy and messy with this crust. Definitely a knife and fork pizza if you get this crust. The sausage was good, but the pepperoni was nothing special."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight. Excellent menu choices. We had a large group of people and got the fat bob, Hawaiian and the meat lovers. They were delicious! The crust is hand made and truly tasty. The restaurant is clean and the staff is very friendly. My only wish is that the restaurant was busier. Stop going to the chain restaurants and visit a place where your money truly counts! Next time we go, we will definitely save room for the dessert pizza."}
{"text":"Decided to try Fatbob's Pizza during the holiday weekend.  Pizza was very greasy, a sign that they are using cheap cheese.  Sauce on the pizza was just average, didn't have much flavor to it.  For the high prices that they charge, I expected better quality.  

Overall, I didn't like the pizza, can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place, very clean and very nice staff. I am not a huge pizza fan, but their pizza is really good! Also the subs are great too! They also have a nice drive thru window for when you call ahead!"}
{"text":"Fat Bob's changed owners back around May. I've ordered twice since then and have been disappointed both times. The first time I got the chicken bacon ranch. It tasted spicier than usual, and I really can't handle spice. I actually thought they gave us the buffalo chicken pizza instead. We decided to try again recently with the chicken bacon ranch and a Fat Bob. The mashed potatoes were a little on the runny side, and yet again the CBR was spicy. So I'm guessing they changed the recipe. The crust was also even soggier/greasier than before. Unfortunately, we won't be frequenting as much as we had in the past."}
{"text":"There's no pizza in the area that compares to Fat Bob's pizzas!!!"}
{"text":"Passed through town and decided to stop by this place for a quick dinner. Pizza isn't generally the healthiest thing, but my friends and I loved the meat-lovers pizza here; bits of bacon & ham, thicker-than-usual slices of pepperoni, an huge chunks of sausage. The crust was pretty good, too, and for a place that mostly does take-out probably, the service was great. The decor is very creative, too, and location is not too far away from the highway. 5/5 for price, quality, quantity, and service."}
{"text":"Pizza was okay, but really greasy! Not the timeliest either. Wings sauce was decent but it was clearly cooked in pizza oven."}
{"text":"It was alright . Don't see what the fuss is all about. Kind of heavy pizza. Tried it but going back to my east of Chicago !"}
{"text":"Gave Fatbobs pizza a try tonight. Overall my family found the pizza to be average to below average. For the high price we thought it would be better. There are many other pizza places in Brunswick with better pizza for a lower price."}
{"text":"This is one of the best pizza place In the area!!! We love the specialty Crust nice and thick with generous amount of toppings. The staff is wonderful  I take the whole family in there with six adults and six kids ranging from newborn to 12 we get super friendly and great service .I love the drive-through window Especially since I have little kids, It makes it a lot easier on those run run nights.They also have delivery which is Great for the night so I just do not feel like going out ."}
{"text":"Cheap crust and cheap cheese- Extremely greasy. Made my entire family sick. Will never order from here again."}
{"text":"based on Luke M.s review, my lady and i had lunch at Fatbob's pizza today. We really liked it. it cost more than i'm used to paying but man was it good. we'll definitely be back for more.  the owner (or manager) was walking to the tables and checking in on the customers - very nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I can't say enough great this about this place the food is worth the drive and the staff can not be more friendlier"}
{"text":"Get there specialty crust.....so good could just eat that with no toppings."}
{"text":"someone in a Fatbob car almost hit a small child in the parking lot of Costco.  I could not believe my eyes as he increased his speed even though there was a child there!! I would not do business with this company ever!!!"}
{"text":"my Husband told me about this place since he has had it before and i haven't. i love pizza so when i find something i like i stick with it.. well fat bobs was amazing..  the owners were really nice and even chatted with us for a couple.   the pizza is amazing.. ive had my share of pizza and its not like any other pizza places in town or in medina.    you wont be disappointed in going..  the store was nice and roomy."}
{"text":"Wow their pizza is good. Thick crust is excellent. Sauce is fresh and tomato flavored. Pricey but a guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, quick delivery, tasty wings...wish crispier"}
{"text":"So Brunswick's best pizza right? Well I was hoping it would live up to those expectations considering this used to be a terrible Pizza Hut long ago. I was not really that hungry after lunch earlier that day but after viewing at all of the classic cars around the area, I knew that I really had to get something to eat...cravings were taking over.

You can go through a drive through if you don't want to sit inside which I highly recommend doing because there is very little seating on the inside during the dinner hours. They have a nice carpeted booth area to the left but with only four booths and tour tables for sitting, you better hope there is at least one open. The tables to the right are good enough for groups but if you are just eating here alone, be ready to share with strangers. 

I wasn't a true fan of the Harley Davidson memorabilia scattered all about the entire walls but I can see how it can appeal to certain demographic, it just wasn't for me but the television was distracting enough to hide away from the decorations. The most important thing to take in consider is the pizza itself. Was it the best pizza I have ever had? I can say it isn't but coming from New York where I am in walking distance from some of the most amazing pizza slices, this comes off as slightly above average at the very most.

I ordered a small nine cheese pizza with the specialty crust to share with me and my brother which was decently priced and affordable. We chose to eat inside and thus we sat down at the table and patiently waited for it to arrive. We were given plates and silverware with no issues by a very attentive and friendly employee who we had no problems with. The wait was a tad long but I don't consider that bad as it was already packed that day and I wasn't expecting the food to arrive as soon as I ordered.

When the pizza arrived, I pretty much lost my taste buds after the second slice after my downright refusal to wait until the pizza cooled down a bit. The pizza had a lot of cheese on it but I had to put it down a few times because of the amount of grease coming off of the cheese and sauce. I did enjoy the pizza and I loved the flavor combined with the crisp and fluffy underside but in short, the grease turned me off greatly and the crust wasn't that thick as described. 

It was a mixed bag overall throughout the entire meal but I did end up saving some for the rest of the family to try to get their own opinions on it. However, I was a bit underwhelmed by the pizza but I would be willing to give it another try when I come back...just hope that it improves in that amount of time."}
{"text":"Honestly, it was a huge disappointment to me and my family. The staff was rude and stingy on their sauces. We asked for extra and our pizza came with hardly any sauce on it. When we picked it up and asked for extra dipping sauce the employee had an attitude and wasn't friendly at all. We spent well over $40 on pizza and breadsticks and there wasn't anything special about it. We heard this place was the best in Brunswick and we had high expectations. It was super greasy and the ingredients were not fresh what so ever. Everything tasted like cheap quality. We will never order from here again. The great American pizza company has our vote for being #1!"}
{"text":"Had pizza and wings at Fatbob's this evening and was WAY impressed.  I usually stick to Angelo's in Lakewood as my fav but was out on a motorcycle ride and decided to try it out.  Deep dish was awesome and wings were so good that we ordered a second batch.  Tell your friends to try our this great, family owned, harley inspired pizza shop and more.  It's worth the trip."}
{"text":"Before eating, I always inquire about food additives. Unfortunately, Bob's does not receive their email. After 3 fone calls, Bob confirmed no msg, corn syrup, or sodium benzoate, so I tried it the next day. Bob was off. His wife Mary was on, but she could not give me directions and got all flustered. I found the place on my own with a little difficulty as the parking lot has poor access from the road. My pizza crust was burned, but I really could taste the superior cheese.  Pizza Roto still rules!"}
{"text":"My wife, daughter, and I tried this place for the first time today.  My wife has Celiac Disease, so when I saw the good reviews on another site for people with Gluten allergies, I figured we would give it a shot.  

My daughter and I had the hand-tossed pizza, with meatballs and mushrooms on my half.  The quality of the pizza is far beyond the nationwide chains and even rivals some of the more upscale pizza places like Mellow Mushroom.  The sauce isn't too sweet and isn't too tart, and I could tell that the cheese is a very good quality one.

I think more importantly to me was that my wife took two bites of her gluten-free pizza and declared it the best gluten-free pizza she had ever eaten.  So many places offer crusts that are either thin and chewy or thin and cracker-like.  The crust here was a good half-inch thick and was soft and fluffy.  I had a few bites and did not notice the gritty quality that plagues so many other crusts in the area.  Its taste was just as good as my gluten-filled crust.  My wife experienced zero problems after eating the pizza, and she is highly sensitive to gluten.

The crew at this location was amazing as well.  We walked in at lunch, and the lady behind the counter was very friendly.  When she heard it was our first visit, she explained the menu to us.  When my wife started asking gluten-related questions, the lady brought up a gentleman from the kitchen who had more experience.  He was patient and friendly as he answered her questions.  I always feel bad for my wife when places treat her like she's some sort of fad dieter.  If I could clone the crew at FatBob's and make them work at other restaurants, I would be happy.  Since I can't do that, I will have to satisfy myself by driving from Canton to Brunswick more frequently to get our pizza fix."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I have ever had. My first job was in a mom and pop Italian pizza place out in medina county. This pizza gives their recipe a run for its money. The specialty crust is amazing. So good! The crust is such a big part of a pizza so having it right goes a long way. Sauce is good as well. Add real cheese and fresh toppings and you have something that is getting harder and harder to find these days. GOOD PIZZA! I would find it hard to believe that anybody wouldn't like this pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered here based on previous Yelp reviews...and it was really good. The seafood pizza was recommended and it was awesome! We also tried the Fatbob pizza with red skin mashed potatoes, bacon and cheddar on it. It was good too but pretty greasy. Cost me $40 for two large (12 slices) specialty pizzas which isn't terrible. I will def be back again."}
{"text":"The deluxe deep dish pizza was fantastic.  The crust is crisp and buttery. I would definitely visit again. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Want to stay south of 480 and west of 71 but don't want to settle for subpar pizza? Then FatBobs is your go to pie place. It's smaller inside but I've never had to wait for a table. I'm sorry but I can't describe what puts the pizzazz their pizzas. Definitely the crust. Most likely the ingredients. Maybe the way it's prepared. I don't know. You're just going to take my word for it. And like it. So there.  Beer and wine served here too - buzz bonus!"}
{"text":"Best pizza place that we have found in Medina County.... Staff is friendly, facility is clean; dine in at least 3 times a month. Pizza is loaded with toppings, and the traditional crust is our favorite...and the left-overs (if we are lucky) make a good breakfast...."}
{"text":"solid pizza.. not too greasy and always done right.. never a bad pie.. well maybe one time a little over cooked.. I usually make my own pizza .. but when we do order out.. its usually Fatbobs"}
{"text":"We drive out of our way to eat at Fat Bobs because it is sooo good.  We like the thicker crust which is crunchy on the bottom.  Great sauce and really good sausage.  Always buy more so we have some to take home and eat later.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza place! You can dine in, carry-out or have delivered - have a drive-through as well.  Can also order by the slice (during daytime only, I think)
We ate in & it has a nice decor - bright, cheerful, & clean w/ a Harley-Davidson theme. Local, family owned.
  Pizza is very good - I like the traditional crust best - it's thin & crispy, but not too thin.  Create your own or  specialty pizza.Tried 3 small specials, as we couldn't decide and  all were great!  The Seafood Supreme was surprisingly light w/ lobster cream sauce, shrimp, crabmeat & spinach. Also had the \"FatBob\" w/ red skin mashed potatoes, bacon, cheddar & garlic butter sauce - different but also tasty!. I'm a veggie lover, so I really enjoyed the Veggie pizza!
  Also has varied salads, hoagies, appetizers, pasta and dessert pizzas (tried apple & cherry ones - yum!)."}
{"text":"best pizza in the area by far. one of the best i've ever had. the seafood pizza is absolutely amazing. great service and they go out of their way to make sure you are satisfied.  so for everyone who said they had an unpleasent experience next time open your mouth and say something or don't complain. unfortunately we know people who have avoided the restaurant because of some of the reviews people have written.  if you don't like the pizza then that's your opinion.  i understand but i eat there quite often and have never had a bad experience . i have never talked to anyone who has either.  for those of you who are wondering no i am not th owner but i am one of his best customers i bet. the only reason i am giving them 5 stars is because it wont let me give them 6. to the management of fat bobs keep up the great work and for god sakes don't change the sea food pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Medina county!  Get the specialty crust... you will not regret it!  Have plenty of napkins in hand though!  Amazing staff, too... everyone is so friendly.  Bonus:  they have a drive thru so you don't have to get out of the car (ya know, when it's cold and rainy and you have the baby in the car!)"}
{"text":"What a great local pizza joint. The specialty crust is the one you have to get.  Get it with the garlic butter sauce for an extra treat. The owner Bob, made my family so welcome yesterday for my daughter's birthday and gave us cherry and apple pies in the house. We also tried the garlic parmesan wings, jojos, and antipasto salad. Plenty to take home and the staff couldn't have been friendlier. Stop in. You will see why they were voted Fox 8 Best Pizza."}
{"text":"First off, I'm deducting a star for the owner or whoever works here that is writing five star reviews and berating Yelpers who write negative ones. You know who you are.... stop it. Not everyone is going to like your pizza. Take the criticism, improve on what people dislike and move on. If you are making good food and have good customer service, the reviews will reflect that. Plus, it's not good form.

Was the pizza good? Yea, it was OK. Do I think it's the best pizza in Brunswick? No.
I would compare this to the sheet pizza you get at school when you're a kid. I swear everyone had the same pizza even though I know it didn't all come from the same restaurant. You know the kind I'm talking about. The sauce is kind of in delicious clumps with cheese that all comes off on the first bite. For some reason it's always cold even though you just got it and the grease leaves your plate orange. There is no reason to like that pizza. But when you're a kid, there is that wonderful time a month when you don't have to eat your bagged lunches or cafeteria food. The pizza party day that serves the greatest pizza ever and you eat way too much. 

Well I'm a grown-up now. The pizza lacked sauce and the cheese all came off in one bite. Magical when you're a kid, expect more when you're an adult. I will say that the pizza with bacon, onions, and jalapenos was put together much better than the pepperoni. It held together nicely and each ingredient stood out. It was still light on sauce but it wasn't nearly as bad as the pepperoni. Honestly, you're not a solid pizza place if you can't master the basics. 

The taste was good. I think the nostalgia of it appealed to me more than the pizza itself but that's not entirely a bad thing. So to sum up...If my office building ordered the pizza again I would eat it, but I would not order from here myself."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  First time here - service was great also. Ordered the deluxe thin crust. It was delicious. Hard to find better pizza than this."}
{"text":"We have been here many Times and love it! everyone has been pretty nice every time we've ordered. the crust is yummy! the only time I did not like it was when we ordered it on New Year's Eve. It was not as good as the several other times we've ordered it. Very pleased and will be back many more
times!!"}
{"text":"This place just opened, and so far so good.  The usual pizza shop choices including subs/sandwiches, salads, pastas, and wings.  I've played it safe on the few times I've been there and just got basic pepperoni / sausage.  You have your choice of their traditional crust or deep dish.  (I hear you can get NY style if you ask).  The crust was ok.  The sauce a little sweet, but well seasoned.  The pepperoni and sausage was of good quality.  Overall, a pretty good pizza that's worth trying again.  I little pricey, but the normal coupon discounts can be found.

The have a great assortment of specialty pizzas that I will have to try.  For instance, the FatBob has garlic butter, red skin mashed potatoes, bacon, red onion and cheddar cheese.  Next on my list.

Has a number of tables and booth available for dining in.  The place is decorated with Harley Davidson mementos (hence the FatBob name).  Also has a convenient drive thru window, in case you worried about burning off too many calories on the ten steps to the door."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this pizza, I eat here at least once a week either dine in or carry out. They have a very convenient drive-thru window for carry out orders; or the restaurant itself offers a laid-back atmosphere for those wishing to dine in.

It's deep dish pizza, definitely order the specialty crust. My favorite thing to order is the specialty crust pizza, with double pepperoni and light cheese. Don't get me wrong, the cheese is very high-quality. They just use a lot of it, so I prefer ordering light... Although the fact that they use a lot of it is probably a great thing to a lot of people! This is by far the best pizza in Brunswick, and I have sampled pretty much all of them. I highly recommend you check this place out."}
