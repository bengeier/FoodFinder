{"text":"Nice local place to go for Vietnamese food. I usually get the noodles with soup or the pork pho. Reasonable prices and very quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a Tuesday night after work. It is far from a fancy place and the the only decor I noticed was a multi-coloured disco lamp. However, there is a kitchen in the back that seems to be run by a nice vietnamese family that knows how to cook. This is a place to go to for a home-cooked vietnamese meal. We had the shrimp fresh spring rolls as an appetizer and the vermicelli with pork and a spring roll. Both were fresh and delicious. The restaurant looks like it seats about 20-30 people. On a Tuesday night, there were about 12 of us dining and multiple people coming in and out for takeout. Vietnamese food is not easy to find in the east end of the city. I would recommend this place for a low-key dinner for those craving vietnamese food without any frills."}
{"text":"We're so lucky to have this restaurant in our neighbourhood. East York may not be the first place you think of when you're looking for Vietnamese cuisine, but Little Coxwell could change that. Exceptional food all around, delivered with friendly and quick service. Even if you are not well versed or that interested in Vietnamese food, give LC a try. Even the wonton soup is a unique and wonderfully spiced version. In a 'hood that normally would smell of burger and pizza joints, it's great to turn a corner and catch the complex and alluring aroma coming from LC. Long live LC!"}
{"text":"Food: good Prices: decent Service: good  The highlight was the goat stew.  Pho and bun dishes were good.  About as good as any other good Viet place in town.    I don't know why people complain about the prices.  I think it's pretty on par with other places, esp downtown.  It's not like all their pho bowls were $2 more than elsewhere.  It seemed normal to me."}
{"text":"I came here because of all the rave reviews. But what I found was mixed feelings towards the quality of the food. We ordered spring rolls, beef Pho noodle soup and green curry. The spring rolls which cost a whopping $5 were burned. Very clearly, they were definitely refried or triple fried. The meat was dry and the rolls were skinny and small. For the price of $5, that's a complete ripoff!   The beef in the Pho noodle soup was mushy. Tons of mushy beef settlement at the bottom of the soup. Portion is extremely small for that price ($10). I have eaten a much fresher and less costly beef Pho in north York or downtown. The noodle is average, nothing special.   Green curry was probably the only better one. Good tasting and good portion.   I guess the only redeeming factor is that there is unlimited tea and hot sauce for your enjoyment.   Definitely I will not go back again since there are many others selections elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a great Thai restaurant in the Upper Beaches area for some time and we've tried a few places that just didn't measure up.  My wife and I cook quite a bit of Thai food so we are really fussy when it comes to good Thai.  Little Coxwell V&T Cuisine was a really nice surprise.   The one downfall that you experience with Thai food in restaurants is the soggy-ness of the dishes that have been sitting around in a pot or a bowl for hours....not here! The vegetable dishes and Mango salad were crunchy and firm. Nice   The curries had a nice flavor and even the pad Thai was pretty good. We are Young Thailand fans...did this place measure up...pretty close.  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Growing up in the east end, my family has always found it hard pressed to find good food nearby when our fridge is empty.  Glad to have wandered upon this place one night when we were too lazy to cook. Good pho, comparable to chinatown vietnamese places, and great vermicelli.  I would suggested the grilled pork vermicelli.  Also the spring rolls were nicely presented and had the addition of mango, which was refreshing. Great place for an affordable meal on the northern east end of toronto!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and now that it's become more popular with the reviews, I feel as though the restaurant doesn't take care of their food.   I love finding hair in my food and I know it's not mine because my hair is currently blonde.   Two thumbs down!"}
{"text":"Very good food, the best Vietnamese I've found in Toronto.  Diner-like atmosphere, but the staff is friendly and the food is great."}
{"text":"The curried goat was phenomenal and the delivery was easy and prompt. Definitely a go-to for your Vietnamese and Thai cravings! As a tip for those with dietary restrictions allergies etc, be sure to ask about all the ingredients in the dishes as the menu does not explain the ingredients in detail. A downside is that there is no brown rice but for me that was not an essential. Really, excellent food, I practically licked the plate clean for their curried goat. My sister had the chicken udon and said it was very fresh and very good. This is definitely becoming a lazy-night go to!"}
{"text":"When you're in need of some noodle soup the morning after a long night and you don't want to drive down to east Chinatown...Little Coxwell will do the trick.  The restaurant has a steady flow of customers either eating in or taking out.  We ordered the shrimp fresh rolls to start. The two rolls were cut up in bite sized portions which was great. Then we had a bowl of pho and a pork & spring roll vermicelli dish. The pho hit the spot. The soup was light and flavorful - very clean tasting. The meat was plentiful as with in the vermicelli dish. No complaints.  It was a little steep compared to other Vietnamese restaurants at $30 after tip for two people but for its close location to home, Little Coxwell does its job well."}
{"text":"Tried them first for delivery, then about a week later for sit down. Food both times was good, but I had the pad thai the first time and I probably wouldn't order it again; a little too sweet for my tastes. For sit down I had the pork and spring roll vermicelli, and would order it again in a heartbeat. Spring roll was nice and crispy, and there was a ton of pork to go with it. My partner had the rare beef pho, and their broth might be some of the best we've tried inToronto. Really delicious, and generous with the beef as well.  Can't believe it took us this long to try them out, but we'll be going back to Little Coxwell often!"}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood so I thought I would check this place out since yelp reviews say 4 stars. We ordered spring rolls, pho, and Thai curry.   Spring rolls were bad. The wrap was the ones Chinese restaurants use as opposed to what most Viet places do. It was two small rolls both cut into halves.  The fish sauce was absolutely tasteless.   The pho was one price and one size. It was about a medium but costs the same as a large at other pho places. The beef they used was a third rate beef that were really tiny strips. Not the norm in pho.   The curry was good but came with low grade rice vs the jasmine rice (extra cost).   Had a lot of chicken pieces which was good.   Not to sound racist (because I'm not) but halfway through my meal I noticed that every customer in the place plus the take out orders where all non-asian. Maybe that says something about this place cuz other pho places I've been normally there are Asians.  However since the curry was good maybe this restaurant has better Thai food than Viet?  Spring rolls - 1 star Pho - 2 star Curry - 4 star Overall - 2 star"}
{"text":"family run restaurant serving very good Vietnamese food.  Been there several times and the food is consistenty good and fresh.  Grilled pork chop dish is a favourite, Pho is always good (and not overly salty)  I would certainly recommend Little Coxwell and it's certainly worth even a drive to enjoy the food.  It's nice to see this place getting positive reviews, Little Coxwell has been around for a few years now and we like to support local family run restaurants."}
{"text":"Pretty good pho for East York, flavourful soup, but definitely has msg.  Only a few options for pho - chicken, rare beef and beef balls.   We had the chicken spring rolls too and they were very tasty, just a little bit pricey, but would have them again!   Atleast parking is free after 6 pm!"}
{"text":"Finally!!  This place is the real deal!!  Excellent flavors because they use real fresh ingredients , and lots of real fresh authentic herbs and chilli's that make a huge difference in flavor!  This is the best food delivery I have ever had - and the service was fast and friendly!  They were at the door in 30 min and everything was fresh, hot and exactly as I ordered it!!  The Tom Yum Chicken soup was massive and full of fresh herbs and chilli's that exploded in my mouth!!  I asked for it extra spicy It was exactly what I needed to help kill my cold!  They also included their own hot chilli sauce that the driver explained is made in house and it had a delicious flavor, in addition to bring very spicy!!  I took another reviewers recommendation and ordered Lemongrass Chicken which is not on their menu but it should be a house speciality because it was FANTASTIC!  This place is a neighborhood gem - I only wish they were in my hood!  I guess I will be visiting my friends more often so I can order delivery from them - and next time I will order extra to take it home. YES It's that good!!"}
{"text":"Excellent local eating spot. Great friendly service. Very flavourful  dishes.   If you are in a rush and you let them know they will get you your food in a timely manner.   Sometimes if it is a slow night they will close early. You may want to call them in advance."}
{"text":"We had come to this little restaurant as a recommendation from friends.  We were so glad to find a good Vietnamese restaurant in the area.    I had the Pork with Vermicelli and husband got the Rare Beef Pho.  We also had the Chicken Fresh Rolls to start.  The fresh rolls were impressive.  Many places we've been to, the rolls are filled with vermicelli and greens.  The fresh rolls here had big chunks of lemongrass, grilled chicken, just enough vermicelli some lettuce and a julienned piece of mango.  I tried a sip of the broth of the Pho and it was very flavourful.  My pork vermicelli was filled with grilled, juicy pork and just enough julienned cucumbers and shreds of lettuce.  My only dislike was that the vermicelli noodles was a tad overcooked.  We will definitely be coming back to this place and we can't wait to try the curries !!"}
{"text":"Such fresh and amazing food. Good prices as well. Best I've had in Toronto so far."}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian pho! The green curry and vietnamese rice noodle bowls are really good as well. Fried rice wasn't so great. Delivery and take-out options are great."}
{"text":"Came here through a friends recommendation and couldn't be more pleased ... The food is authentic and tastes sooo good ... Was definitely our first but won't be our last ... If you crave thai food, eyes closed this is THE place .."}
{"text":"We used to be regulars but not anymore. This restaurant has the most disrespectful staff, more specifically manager, we have encountered. They told us the delivery would arrive in one hour. It arrived in TWO hours. When we called, instead of apologizing and explaining the ridiculous delay, the woman proceeded to yell at us and somehow blame us (very weird) for this delay and say that they don't even do delivery (we've always ordered delivery from them) . In the end we gave up and ate cereal at home, that is how upset and disappointed we were with the whole experience. We told her she lost longtime customers, she said \"too bad it's on you\" (again, not sure why). They don't deserve customers, they are incredibly rude and ungrateful, not to mention horrible ethic. She called us an hour later, we thought, to finally apologize, but no, to say the driver got a \"ticket from police\".  I highly recommend you guys get your Thai fix elsewhere. They don't deserve the hype."}
{"text":"Food -4.5 stars  Price- a bit steep for vietnamese cuisine. I paid $10 after tax for a bowl of pho (one LARGE size)"}
{"text":"Love this place!  We eat at several of the VIetnamese places on Gerrard but I would rather drive an extra 10 minutes to eat here. The ingredients are very fresh - best salad rolls I've had in Toronto. Love the calamari and Pho too!"}
{"text":"Looks like there is a change in the owners......chaos reigns supreme. Take out orders wrong, challenging wait staff. New owners doesn't appear to have any previous restaurant experience. Came here on a Saturday for my pho fix. Was told to seat our selves, they were busy \" clarifying \" a take out order with a customer. Had to wave a server over to take our order......And then we waited. Food was flying out the door, delivery guy flying out the door, while we waited and waited. The solo blind customer was promptly seated and served his wine and dinner....while we continued to wait. The party of three was seated and served their food while we waited.....To add insult to our growling stomachs, the waiter returned and asked if the order he had written down on the piece of paper was correct?! At this point I informed him that since he had not placed our order and we had patiently waited more than 20 mins for our food...that he could save himself the trouble of placing our food order. Luckily our back up Thai place was more than happy to serve us promptly Jajutka is just up the street! Will not be returning anytime soon......truly sad...."}
{"text":"One of the best Vietnamese restaurants in the city.  Everything is good and service is on point.   Pho is perfect and not salty.  Meat dishes are flavourful and fresh.  Hardly ever busy and great value."}
{"text":"If only I could provide negative stars. It was my first time ordering last night and I called at 10:30pm to place a delivery order.  The woman who answered checked with the other staff as the kitchen was closing. Then she proceeded to take my order. I ordered a couple things then was told their minimum is 25$. So I ordered an extra item. Then I was told that delivery is an extra $5 because I \"live too far\". She took my address, phone number, asked how I would pay, then hung up.  Not only did no one ever show up with my order, they never even had the decency to phone back to say they changed their minds.  Worst ordering experience I've ever had."}
{"text":"The food was great! I highly recommend the crispy noodles (they use a thicker egg noodle that I haven't seen other restaurants do). The restaurant is a little small and can get a little hot in the summer (don't get pho in July...) but the food is delicious and the prices are reasonable. Then you can get ice cream at Lickadee Split next door :P"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and each time the food is passable but something about this place perplexes me. The pho soups are decent, well priced at $8.95  and the Thai curries very tasty and consistent.The coconut rice, while tasty is a bit of a rip off when substituted  for the accompanying rice ($2.50 )  Pad Thai noodles are soup like and should be avoided at all costs. They verge on being putrid.   Appetizers from the starter section are vastly overpriced and portions miniscule. A Kalbi rib starter offers 4-5 small pieces at $10.00 Brutal value as they are quite average  !!!  5 micro shrimp spring rolls $ 5.00 and are tasteless. Avoid. And try to find a shrimp in any of them.  Service. Hahaha lol. Very peculiar.  Sometimes the delivery guy will take your order, sometimes the 11 yr old niece will , perhaps the woman who owns the place. You can be rest assured that groups of even 4 people will not have their meals arrive at the same time often separated by a staggering 15-20 minutes. Seems the wait staff have little or no table service experience and common sense is not used very often.  Appears the business places more of an importance on brisk takeout traffic lingering in the \"dining\" room.Maybe takeout is the route to go. Dining in is not fun at all and the lady owner is a Vietnam version of Leona Helmsly.  Very perplexing ! Having a 4 star Yelp rating shows the overall ignorance of many Toronto Yelp reviewers."}
{"text":"Amazing food, even better customer serviceve, with reasonable pricing.  A must for anyone who's close to the area."}
{"text":"Dream food! A hidden gem! Recommended 100%.  I did shake hands with the chef. Excellent food!"}
{"text":"Great food and definitely the best place for pho is East York. They have an extensive menu with lots of great rice and noodle options."}
{"text":"A great little local Vietnamese restaurant located on a friendly little strip of shops in East York. The food is delicious and authentic - ingredients fresh and flavourful.  The Pho is outstanding and the restaurant  offers both take out and delivery.  A lovely touch is a free cup of tea while you wait for your take out. The price is right and it's a welcome addition  to the take out options in the area.   The restaurant itself is modest - a tiny storefront with seating for maybe 20-25 patrons but the hospitality is warm, which makes it a nice little place to stop with a friend for a cheap, healthy meal."}
{"text":"Despite the fact that the owners are Vietnamese, this restaurant also makes some kick ass Thai curries! Confirmed they make they're own paste in house. So good!  Portions compared to other Thai I've had are huge. My husband isn't the biggest Thai curry fan, but once he got a taste of mine, he was sure to get it the next time.  He's also had the pho ( a self proclaimed authority after working near the 400 and Finch which is full of pho) and confirmed it was pretty darn good.   A gem of a hole in the wall!"}
{"text":"Best of east Toronto. Amazing pho. My personal favorite is the rare and well done beef. Specially good for curing hangovers. :-)"}
{"text":"Legit. Good. I had vermicelli with pork and spring rolls. GF had pho, soup is a bit greasy but beef is good. Recommended, if you are in the area"}
{"text":"This was the best pho I've ever had.  The spices in the broth were very complex - tasted like star anise, cinnamon, coriander.  The fragrant sawtooth coriander and Thai basil were fresh and delicious, and the serving size was just right for a filling meal.  Will definitely go back.  Also, I recommend the deep fried tofu appetizer!"}
{"text":"I loved the goat Curry last week and this week we tried the green curry. It was authentic for Canadian standards, loved it. Been getting the crispy noodles for my wife and kids, they love it. Comes with plenty of vegetables. Can't wait to dine in to try the pho."}
{"text":"Food is good, better than majority of other Viet places. Prices/Service is decent to good. Parking/tables is pretty limited. Had rice with pork chop, chicken, fried egg. Haven't tried anything else because that's all I've been ordering from there haha.  Edit: The fried egg doesn't come included with the meal I listed above, majority of other places do include it but you have to pay extra for it."}
{"text":"Tasty and well priced, particularly nice for an area that lacks other choices.   A fan of the mango salad and the chicken spring rolls (which was a great alternative for someone who can almost never eat spring rolls).   There was a bit too much sauce/liquid in the rice dish I had, but the flavour wasn't overpowering and the rice was served on the side so it wouldn't get mushy.   Would definitely go again if I were looking for a casual, just need a meal kind of place in the area."}
{"text":"This place is great and definitely our favourite Thai/Vietnamese take out in the city.  Highly recommend the Red Curry with Shrimp and chicken pad Thai."}
{"text":"I go to this family run place as often as I can.  Their Rare Beef Pho is outstanding, the Green Curry Shrimp is phenomenal, and their Grilled Pork and Rice is fantastic.  The price is right, the portions are just a little on generous!!!    I recommend this place to everyone I meet."}
{"text":"Little Coxwell is one of the best - if not the best - Thai spots in East York. We've been multiple times and they never disappoint.  Today, we got the chicken pad thai, red curry with beef and a side of coconut rice for $26 plus tax. The pad thai was flavourful, not dry (I hate when pad thai is dry) and had lots of chicken. The curry was delicious as well - I loved the addition of the green beans and they didn't skimp out on the beef.   To top it all off, the staff is attentive and courteous, and they always bring fortune cookies at the end of your meal (who doesn't love fortune cookies?). Worth a visit if you're in the east end."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to trying the food here.  My partner and I have our usual favorite restaurants for Thai and Vietnamese, but we wanted to try a new place in the neighborhood, and this place had really good reviews.  Apparently, the staff didn't find our patronage necessary.  When we arrived and sat at a table, we were brought menus, a bottle of water and cups.  We read through the menu for about 5 minutes and then waited for our order to be taken.  And waited.  And waited. At about the same time we arrived, a table of guys also arrived.  During the time that we waited, this table had their order taken, they were given drinks, and actually had food served.  Also during this time, the same server taking care of this table, also talked on the phone, I assume taking orders - fine, then kind of stood around the till, took another phone order, then stood leaned against the door jamb of the kitchen, and then got the food for the aforementioned table.  I was ready to go after 15 minutes of being ignored,  but my partner wanted to give it a chance and tried to get the server's attention.  When he motioned to her, she sort of looked askance at us and made a sound, which seemed like acknowledgement, but continued what she was doing. We sat for another two minutes and then I'd had it.  I couldn't stand another minute of being completely disregarded so we left.  Really disappointing because I like supporting local restaurants but unfortunately, I wont go be going back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"Enjoyable meal, but a bit overhyped in my opinion. Parts were good, others were just okay."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for about 3 years now. Sometimes I eat in, most times I take out because I live in East York. Great family run restaurant. Very friendly owners. I've never had any problems with the food or service. I mostly order the pork vermicelli with spring roll. It always taste great and it's always filling. I sometimes get the calamari and ask for it spicy...fantastic. The soups are awesome as well if you like soup."}
{"text":"Hands down the best viet-thai restaurant in East York. I keep on coming back because their food is so good and affordable. Basically everything me and my family have ordered is delicious. Don't forget to try their calamari and pho! The chow mein is yummy too!"}
{"text":"Great family run restaurant.  Good food.  Restaurant is small and can get packed on weekends.  Often order delivery.  My favourite is Pork Vermicelli and Green Curry Chicken."}
{"text":"Oh just the most delicious flavourful broth! By far the best rare beef noodle soup I've had in month.   We ordered delivery two orders of rare beef noodle soup, fresh rolls with shrimp and fries tofu. The tofu was very good, could have been a bit more crisp for my tastes but it was great and their unique peanut sauce (more like a peanut vinaigrette) is fantastic.   Now, back to the soup. Our orders came with quite a bit of very fresh beef, lots of fresh herbs and onions as well as hoisin, Sriracha, and sambal. The broth is fragrant and quite beefy. It was exactly what we expected and I'm grateful that we have a Vietnamese go-to in our new neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Little gem in the heart of Old East York. Family is friendly, service is always on point. Food is always fantastic. Best deep fried tofu and pho in the city."}
{"text":"Ok....maybe I just went there on a bad day but I was pretty disappointed. I probably would have given this more stars because the food was ok but I couldn't believe how expensive it was. I got the pho soup, 10$. My friend got an order of pad Thai,$12. Both were pretty good but away overpriced."}
{"text":"Mediocre food at best. Nothing that really speaks volumes in terms of taste. It's your pretty basic staple Vietnamese and Thai dishes. Great for a quick take out and cheap eats after some sports or if you're Just feeling lazy  I gave it 4 stars just cause the owners are nice and the food was a quick fix for a Vietnamese craving.  Ordered the beef vermicelli - wasnt too bad. Beef had taste. Fish sauce was a little bland and noodles were decent. Spring roll was surprisingly quite good.  Would come back, but would probably just take out next time"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a weekday.   Pros - Family style ambiance  - Food tastes good - Fairly quick service   Cons - Some food options can be a little overpriced"}
{"text":"mango fish is delicious! the portion size is great as well  also tried the Vietnamese pork/spring roll on vermicelli and it's also delicious.   major bonus they do delivery and happy to have found great Asian food in east york"}
{"text":"I have to give the previous reviewers a big thanks. I'm not sure I would have tried this place out if it hadn't been for the numerous positive reviews here. We ordered a rare beef noodle soup and a pork and spring roll vermicelli salad. Absolutely fantastic and I'm so impressed with this gem!"}
{"text":"I've come here a few times for dinner and lunch and it's nice to have some variation of food in this area.  Typically along the Coxwell strip there are just fast food restaurants, so it's nice this little place popped up.  The staff here are friendly, polite and always come by to refill your drinks.  They bring the food out fairly quick and have always got my order down perfect.  The food here is good, I wouldn't say it's amazing Vietnamese food, but definitely passable.  In particular their lamb curry was delicious, although not always available for order.  The pho here is decent, the broth is well made, but the pho itself could use more meat as all the bowls I've ordered have been a bit skimpy.  I really wish they used fresh noodles here as it would have made me give this place a higher rating.  Often I get the pho noodles in a big clump at the bottom of my bowl, which isn't the best way to eat pho.  Overall it's a decent place and the price is alright.  It's a bit higher than most Vietnamese places downtown, but that's probably due to the traffic they receive and location.  I'd come back again, but for other dishes instead of the pho noodle bowls here."}
{"text":"Extremely legit pho restaurant around the corner from my parents place that I tried for the first time a few weeks ago. I'm actually shocked at how amazing this place is because I grew up in the area and the strip of stores and restaurants in East York Village have always been sub par. BUT NOW THEY HAVE THIS PLACE!  This place is on par with downtown Pho joints. Make sure you get the spring rolls with your meal, they are awesome."}
{"text":"Love the food here; it's very fresh and crisp. Great pricing but not too many food options. Green curry beef and Spicy green bean beef was so flavourful and nicely prepared, meaning perfectly cooked and it wasn't too spicy/hot. Pad Thai was nice and once it was a bit on the sweeter side. My favorite soup is Hot and Sour soup and their version has a really nice taste but its missing few ingredients like black stringy mushroom and the egg."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times in the past few months. This time I ordered the Green curry with beef and coconut rice. The coconut rice is the best I've had in the city, the green curry was just above average.  My girlfriend ordered the pad thai with chicken. It was good but personally it was too sweet for my liking (I prefer just spice).   Portion sizes were good and the price makes it great value. Service was also quite quick. It's a family run restaurant (little girl brought us plates) which gives it a nice feel."}
{"text":"Good food. Not always consistent. But a good local pho. Favorite dish is spicy basil glass noodle! Very yummy!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch because of the high Yelp ratings.  The food was good but not amazing.  I wouldn't say the portions are large like some reviewers.  Came here with my family and we all finished our meals no problem with an order of a shrimp spring roll app.  The shrimp spring rolls was 4 little shrimps rolled in won ton wrapper and deep fried.  Def not worth the 5.95.  I ordered mango fish and I really enjoyed my meal though.  Other members of my group ordered vegetarian fried chow mein.  There was a lot of fried noodle but barely any veggies on top and a few cut up fried tofu balls.  We also ordered a shrimp pad Thai and it was really small.  2 other rice dishes which portions were also small and nothing special.  $95 after tax and tip for lunch for 5 is not really what I consider cheap for hole in the wall Asian food where you walk out not completely stuffed.  But keep in mind I live in the Markham/Richmond hill area where good, cheap, Asian food is plentiful."}
{"text":"During summer, this is my go-to pho place because it consistently serves a nice bowl of pho.   I've only ordered their pho here but I've never left disappointed. Because it is never too busy, I can enjoy my bowl in peace without the bustle and rushed service that I usually experience at other pho locations. The broth is very clean and not oily at all. Although there isn't that \"wow\" factor for me, my memories of this place are sunny afternoons with a solid bowl of pho - obviously the definition of a perfect lunch.  It seemed a bit far at first but it really is a quick trip in the afternoon for Torontonians who live by the DVP :)"}
{"text":"We were curious about all the good reviews and the stellar food. We went the other day and ordered a rice (com) and a noodle (mi xao). While Vietnamese food is usually good on the vegetables side, there were almost none. The rice came with cucumbers only and the veggies for the noodles were too under cooked. We also had some calamari and half of them were well cooked (crispy and soft inside) but the rest was brown burnt.  All together it was a not too expectations compared to other Vietnamese east of the dvp."}
{"text":"Best freshest pho  place in Toronto! Clean place low-key, but food is excellent! Have been looking for a place like this for 5 years now...LOVE it and will be back many times again! Also great friendly service. We had #21 (rare beef pho) and #42 (chicken vermicelli) -- my husband and I traded meals half way through and was perfect to have both (especially if you find big bowls of pho hard to finish!)"}
{"text":"Awesome food if you're looking to satisfy your Viet cravings!.. I've come here plenty of times -  mostly for take-out and it always hits the spot.  I usually get the BBQ Pork Vermicelli with Spring Roll, which I highly recommend.  It's delicious, flavourful and everything is made fresh.  The portion sizes are decent for the price that you pay.  Although, the restaurant seems kind of old and run down and the staff aren't the friendliest, the food is what keeps me coming back for more.  My co-workers and I make it a ritual to come at least once a month so that pretty much says it all.  We're hooked, check it out for yourself!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat !  they have a dish call spicy lemongrass is really yummiest  Not on the menu"}
{"text":"How is this place 4 rated stars overall?! I came here expecting above average pho but I walked out disappointed. Immediately when I walked in, I noticed there was all caucasians...so i was thinking to myself what should I expect. I ordered the rare beef pho, they only had one size and the price was $9.75...i mean talk about overpriced?! It was even more dissatisfying when the bowl came out. All you could see was layers of oil. The broth was so cloudy, you couldn't even see the meat or noodles under it. Then I started eating it, broth had little to no flavour and they literally dumped the beef in a big chunk making it hard to separate. Just horribly disappointed. This place doesn't even deserve a two star because it was literally a hole in the wall, it was so pretty dirty inside. Definitely not going back."}
{"text":"This place is a small little gem and very busy.  The tables were full and the phone was ringing off the hook with take out orders. As I  waited for my take out I was served a hot tea which was nice since it was so cold out.  I ordered green curry with veggies and tofu. It was very flavorful and very fresh. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I'm moving next door to this place... This IS the best vietnamese in GTA. Best pho, vermicelli,, bbq beef is crazy good. Throw in a nice crunchy noodle with chicken for the gui lau.. Tasty..... I still need to try the eggplant and some spring rolls and the calamari and the shrimp app and the shakes and bubble teas..could the pad thai be really good too??? That would be trouble.. I guess I should start taking pics of my feasts there for all you peeps:."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went for a quick dinner here after searching on Yelp for good Thai restaurants.   We ordered the crispy fried tofu ($6.95) appetizer to start. The tofu wasn't the firm kind that I was hoping for. They were soft, like the ones you get from the plastic buckets at Asian restaurants. The peanut sauce wasn't very good, either. It was thin in consistency and didn't stick to the tofu very well.   I ordered the chicken pad thai ($10.95) and my fiancé ordered the green curry chicken ($10.95) and upgraded his rice to coconut rice ($1.50). My pad thai was good. Saucy, which is what I like in my pad thai. I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't any tofu in my pad thai, but there was a generous portion of chicken in there and the flavour was right. Just the right amount of sweet. I found my entrée to be a little small for the price, but I enjoyed it. My fiancé's green curry chicken came in a large bowl and it was full of chicken, green peppers, and red peppers. It was very flavourful with the right amount of spice and coconut. The coconut rice paired perfectly with the green chicken curry. The coconut rice was delicious on its own, too.   This place also carries pho, but it was kind of pricey ($8.95) for just one size."}
{"text":"The rating is actually a 3.5 star rating. I'm in between A-Ok and Yay! I'm a fan.  A friend recommended this place to me and told me that it was a good authentic Vietnamese restaurant. You would be quite surprised how hard it is to find really good Vietnamese food in the east end of the city, there are quite a few mediocre Vietnamese restaurants but none I can say that's really good and this includes East Chinatown.  I ended up ordering the Pho Tai Nam  which is essentially a rare & well done beef noodle soup ($8.75 for one size) and my friend ordered the Beef Vermicelli With a Spring Roll ($8.50 for one size). The pho was pretty good, but not great, the meat was a good quality, noodles were cooked properly and most importantly it was a good broth that was void of msg. My friend said her dish was pretty good, the meat was seasoned properly with lemongrass and the noodles were cooked properly.  The service was good and the people that own the restaurant are friendly. The reason why it's not quite a 4 star rating and more a 3.5 star rating is because they don't offer a lot of the traditional Vietnamese dishes which is understandable since I'm under the impression in that particular area, many people wouldn't end up ordering those particular dishes and the other reason is because it's quite pricey especially for the east end of the city."}
{"text":"a very intimate homey,family-run restaurant serving good viet and thai food.   the broth for their pho is rich,yet simple. the broth is flavourful,you can definetly taste that the beef and herb flavours.  their rare beef can be hit/miss depending on when you go. I've also had and enjoyed their grilled beef, grilled chicken and porkchops. nicely seasoned, and with hints of lemongrass.  service there is very family-style. you'll often see a young girl, maybe about 12-13yrs old who is always helping out there with her family.She's very friendly and very capable. Some days, it seems like she's running FOH."}
{"text":"I went Friday night for dinner and the place was pretty busy, I took it as a good sign as this area I call is home is usually sort of a deadzone. I had to wait a couple minutes while a table was cleared to be seated, but not a big problem. I ordered the rare and well done beef pho, the chicken spring rolls, and a beer. The pho was really tasty. The broth was a little more subtle than I had hoped but it was very well crafted. The beef was amazingly tender. The usual suspects (sprouts, cilantro, chili, basil, lime) came on the side in hearty amounts. The chicken rolls weren't good in comparison to other places (Ginger) but were edible in their own right. The beer was $4.50 and they were out the one I wanted. Boo. The pho was about $8 and fairly priced because it was really big. The spring rolls were over priced at about $5 for two. I'm really excited to have this place just around the corner from home. I'll go back."}
{"text":"Yummmm! I've eaten in and taken out, always consistent and low prices, my fav is the pork vermicelli.  The fried calamari is delish too.  Fast service and take out, call ahead for fast pick-up.  The service is great and friendly.  The best viet-thai in East York, Yay!"}
{"text":"Really great food & service. Ordered the calamari, Mango Salad fish, and Rare beef + ball Pho.  Really great environment and the coconut rice is amazing. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Another visit...another exceptional experience. This time we tried their red curry and this is the best that I have ever tasted. It had the rich coconut flavor that will blow your mind with the first spoon.   We also tried their Beef ball and rare beef pho, I think it is their best phone as it gets the flavor from the balls. I have to come again to try their Goat curry...it smelled good...  You should also try their Stir fried beef with king oyster mushrooms...yummm"}
{"text":"I call this home now.  Been here too many times and always get the same awesome service from the family that owns it and amazing quality food too.  If you haven't tried their Mango fish....man that must be my fav meal there but it is too big for me to finish it all."}
{"text":"It's an \"okay\" Thai/Vietnamese place. Clearly not the best but the nearest for a delivery!   Curry are good but too much grease and vegetable compare to meat.  Fresh rolls are very good but spring rolls aren't always daily made!  Rice portion is low.   Delivery is really long, nothing less than 45mn (!) and the deliver guy or the person who take order never follow our instruction!  They're ALWAYS ring our neighbors' bell...  Well. It's ok when you want a curry once in a while, not every week.  High price."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this non-descript restaurant.  Great service and the food was excellent.  I went in with zero expectations and will definitely be back given what a pleasant experience it was.  Tasty pho and an out of this world shrimp appetizer.  From what I've read here, it sounds like the Thai choices are really good, too.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and always consistent! I usually order take out and i'm never disappointed.  The chicken pad thai is always yummy. The rare beef pho is also really tasty! My only problem when I order is that it is spread into 4 containers!   I can't judge service as I have never actually eaten in the restaurant but staff is always smiling and polite when I order!"}
{"text":"This \"little\" place is a little different than the crowd. Little implies cozy, intimate, homey, made from scratch and this place has some of those elements. While I wouldn't call them \"intimate\" however they do provide a sense of coziness and homeyness. And by that I am referencing to their preparation of food.  Unlike most, their broth is not laced with MSG or enough beef boullion cubes (or beef broth cubes) to make a high rise. You can tell this stuff is made from scratch. What you get is a nice clean broth, lightly seasoned with excellent complexity and flavour depth. You get that bold fattiness from the beef with hints of cinnamon, star anise, fennel, coriander and fresh ginger all rounded out by the sweetness from the onions. This is a lighter fare when compared to other pho broths so you may not like this if you are accustomed to the often sodium laced stuff. But I would say give it a few more sips and it should grow on you. The flavours do show up and you will enjoy it.  I had to take away 1 star because of the often seen mediocre cuts of meats they use. This is an unfortunate reality of most Pho places.  This is definitely a keeper and was a great bowl of noodles!"}
{"text":"We love Little Coxwell! Great place in the neighbourhood for lunch / dinner. They also have a veg noodle soup with lemon grass broth! The fresh rolls are delicious as well as the curries. Can't go wrong here! Support this local family owned shop, you won't regret it"}
{"text":"Great little hidden gem in East York!  We tried this place based on the glowing Yelp reviews and were not disappointed.   We got our food to go as we had our dog with us in the car . We ordered: - rare beef pho - seafood pho - vegetarian spring rolls - deep fried tofu  Service was lovely and friendly (they even gave us complimentary tea while we waited for our order) and our take-out order came packed very nicely: all the components of our pho were packed individually and they even included little plastic Asian soup spoons.  The seafood pho featured big, generous pieces of seafood and the beef pho also came with a generous meat portion. I liked that they kept the noodles and the meats separate from the broth so that the beef could still be enjoyed \"rare\" and the noodles not soggy when the elements were combined when we got home. Also appreciated that the broth for the seafood pho was different from the broth for the beef pho.  Next time I'll definitely have to give the Thai offerings a try; the fact they use house-made curry paste is certainly appealing."}
{"text":"Best Thai food everrrrrr!!!!! Omg I can't say enough about how delicious the food is. If you're a fan of curries, this is your spot. It's a small little family owned restaurant, casual and cozy. Friendly service, fast and fresh. It's my go to takeout place. They also offer delivery. It's by far the best Thai place I've been to (and I really love Thai). Five stars!!!"}
{"text":"Had the green mango salad, beef balls and rare beef pho and beef pad Thai.   Green mango was refreshing and tasted okay. I didn't like how they used ripe mango coz it was soft. It's missing the crunching component   Rare beef and beef ball pho was alright. Soup was decent.  Pad Thai was different than other ones I have had. This tasted very sweet. It was way too much sauce. I would not go back for the pad Thai again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.    Their hot and sour soup is to die for...Best I have ever had and I have had some good ones!"}
{"text":"Came here because of the high yelp ratings, and was a bit disappointed. The pho is alright and was very small for the price. There is only one size they offer.  Spring rolls were a tad small for the price and were only medicore.  My bf enjoyed the green chicken curry, but he felt quite ill afterwards.   The service was very good and friendly, family owned restaurant. They give fortune cookies at the end of the meal, which we found nice."}
{"text":"Who would have guess that you would be able to get fairly decent Vietnamese restaurant in East York?   Not quite the same as Chinatown in terms of pricing (slightly higher) but definitely one of the better Vietnamese restaurants outside of the neighbourhood. When I don't have time to go to Chinatown, this is the next best thing as it is down the street from me.  So far the only items I have tried are the phos (beef, chicken & vegetarian) - and they have not disappointed me! Especially the chicken pho.  Next time I go back, I'm going to try the banh cuon (steamed rice noodle) and the vermicelli!"}
{"text":"Interior is a little dingy and there is a heavy Chinese incense smell. To be honest, if not for the high Yelp ratings, I don't think I would have tried this place because it looked a little shabby. So thanks for helping me discover a gem, Yelpers! :)  Aesthetics aside, the soup for the pho is delicious and you can tell it is house made! There's just a really authentic flavour to it. The portion was also really big because I had a tough time finishing it =(  The vermicelli with spring rolls was also ordered and I was told that it was delicious - even without the fish sauce!"}
{"text":"Great little family run place. The food is what you come for and you should come hungry. Prices are very reasonable. It can get busy in  here around weekends butler generally you shouldn't need a reservation."}
{"text":"I've been here once & plan to come again (I'll keep ya updated yelp) the mango salad was AMAZING. Super fresh, good portion, very yummy. The pad Thai was not my favourite but my wife really enjoyed it. The service was very basic. Not rude or anything but nothing amazing either. My he food came super fast! I loved that.  The atmosphere was tacky to say the lease but I would get take out next time. Overall I'm going to be back, worth checking out if you are in the area & want thai food but I won't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"This place isnt the nicest looking however the food is fabulous  Prices are great  Family ran  Love this place"}
{"text":"Real authentic Viet food made by real Viet people. The soup for the pho ...the shrimp salad rolls...the com and grilled pork chops...the  bun..all made by grandma Viet in the  back.   Nice little family owned shop.  Definitely a hidden gem in the neighborhood .  The only thing I would comment on is the portion size  for the prices you pay.  Its great food though.  And the iced Viet coffee...so smooth and tasty...the coconut shake is made with  real coconut ....sooooooo good!!  Definitely a place I'd go to again and again.  My friend says im obsessed...what can i say? I love food, but i love great viet food!  Check it out!!"}
{"text":"A family run business, excellent service, amazing food and fabulous prices. I love their Lemon Grass soup and their Green Curry chicken is also very good. Also try their Fried Rice, the Rice texture is very different from most places. Also enjoyed their Spicy Green Bean and Garlic Broccoli dish."}
{"text":"\"Little\" Coxwell Restaurant indeed ... Little taste, freshness, spice and finally little service.. I like to check out new places without preconceived expectations built up by glowing reviews which after all are extremely subjective so I am rather surprised to see the 4/5 star rating for this place.   In an effort to keep the body primed for New Years and the ensuing eating/drinking marathon about to commence, my sweetie and I decided to order light the night before ...  #77 stir fried veggies with rice and #71 garlic pepper shrimp  with rice.  Called in the order to pick up and they answered promptly (later I knew why), pleasant reception by order taker and food promised in 10 mins.  I arrived approx. 12 mins later to pick up and spied what I assumed was my order on a table nearby. A woman (the owner) was on the phone motioned me to sit at a a nearby table and when she was off the phone asked if I was paying cash. I was not and pulled out my interac card. She grimaced and asked me again if I was paying cash, ugh! She then preceded to ignore me whilst answering no less than a half dozen more calls all the while hollering at the older woman with a small child slung on her hip standing behind the counter. 10 minutes after I entered she finally handed me the card terminal to pay and handed me the bag I'd correctly assumed was my order.  What was in the bag was very \"little\" to write home about but disappointing enough to feel the need to share on Yelp. Old, soggy veggies, in particular the bok choy which was slimy. No distinctive flavours in either dish and I was not surprised by the over cooked shrimp dish ... I found 3 extra empty shrimp tail shells that didn't come off any of the ones in the actual order. Where did they come from I shuddered to wonder. Not even the slightest redemption came in the steamed rice which was a mix of old, dried out grains with the latest batch which was also not that fresh.   So I gave in this morning and had a quick glance at the Yelp reviews and I'm wondering if the last few one star ratings didn't hit the nail on the head? Please consider this review another hit to the same nail!"}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me so long to try this place, given that I live so close.  I think it was because they make both Vietnamese and Thai food.  The owners are Vietnamese, so as such, I tend to stick to the Vietnamese items.  Their grilled meats with rice are good, as is the Pho.  They have a nice broth to their pho, and while the menu there is fairly simple (on the pho front), they have a special spicy pork noodle soup (#29a), which is different from any pho place I've tried.  It is so good!  My friends I went with one night also ordered the pad thai and they enjoyed it too.  We tried the calamari, which is basically fried with spicy salt, and we also have had the spring rolls, but they definitely weren't my favourite.  It's a great find in the area and has definitely started to become a regular place for us to eat.  They were also fairly child friendly too, which is a plus."}
{"text":"Great little family run gem on a surprising cute stretch of Coxwell north of the Danforth. If you are from the west end or are familiar with Golden Turtle on Ossington, like myself, and are craving some vegetarian pho or a vermicelli bowl than this is the place for you. The menus are very similar, but I think this space here is more tidy.  We ordered takeout and it was fast and ready on time. We got vegetarian phos (noodle soups) and there was a hearty amount of vegetables, especially broccoli. It really hit the spot of a cool fall day when I had a bit of a sore throat. Will definitely be back and am curious to try out their other dishes."}
{"text":"I found the food overooked, very odd flavouring - one pad thai dish simply unedible and a noodle soup blan, skimpy and uninteresting. I was not compensated for returning the dishes-paid full price and left. This is my first 1 rating ever. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious.  Will return to try other dishes.  The service was friendly but I felt bad for the woman managing the front of the house. She was swamped with take out orders.  Decor is diner meets barber shop, but the food more than made up for it."}
{"text":"Really good Pho. Right amount of noodles and meat not too much fish sauce in the broth either. Deep fried tofu and spring rolls are excellent. Goat and vermicelli noodles are excellent like grandmother use to make."}
{"text":"Came back here for more delicious Vietnamese food. This time I got the pork vermicelli noodle with spring roll and oh my goodness was it delicious!! Like other reviews mentioned, I didn't even need the sauce that it comes with. The dish itself had a lot of flavour and when it's all mixed up it really blends well together! Unfortunately I did not take a picture of my food or hubby's (he had the rare beef rice noodle soup) because we were so hungry and excited to eat! Pictures from other reviewers looked very very similar to what what our dishes looked like. I started craving this food again the very next day. Going back really soon!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  We've been coming here for years.  My son loves the grilled beef and rice.  They do a great vegetarian pho.  Family owned and they are very friendly."}
{"text":"This place has decent Pho. The broth is saltier than most places but over all it's a good portion for the price. There's only 1 size and I was sad to find out that they don't offer tripe."}
{"text":"This is a very nice restaurant, the price is right, and the service is very nice. I think that this might be the best Vietnamese restaurant in the area.  The Pho is stellar, as well as the pad Thai. The lemongrass soup is a great entry.  There are other fine Vietnamese places (in Spadina or Yonge), but this one has the best and most calm one. It's ok to come, to take out (you even get a seat and free tea), and for delivery."}
{"text":"Pho is excellent. Spring rolls are really tasty. Green curry has so much flavour. This place is great!"}
{"text":"I love the food!  I soon as I got there the place smelled like a Vietnamese restaurant - Pho, mint, lemon grass. I had the rare beef Pho, and that was awesome! They used the thinner noodles, and I love that; and the soup was full of flavour.   The mango fish was amazing; I ordered coconut rice to go it - a fantastic combination with the fish sauce. They make great fish sauce - salty, sour, sweet, garlic - Perfect!   The red curry with beef was another amazing dish. The curry taste clean and light, while full of spice.   The food in general was cooked with fresh ingredients, and clean oil.   It was very busy when I got there. They had a full house, and lots of take out orders. I could see that every one was working very hard to get the orders out. It is cleared that it is a family run business; the owner's Mom did the cooking.  Overall, I can't wait to come back there.  One suggestions, if they can some how improve on the cold shrimp roll. It is my most favourite Vietnamese food - I can eat it all day. I would have like to see added thinly sliced pork, slim green onion, and a bit more mint."}
{"text":"My wife suggested this place because she had heard about it from a friend. I was a bit hesitant because, well, it kinda looks a bit run down, in my opinion. However, the food turned out to be very, very good. First time I was there I had the pho (I think it was the one with 2 kinds of beef - one rare and one cooked). I've tried a lot of pho and every time I get it I always wonder, after the fact, why I did -  I am usually disappointed by a sad, mostly bland, tasteless mess of overcooked noodles. Not the case here - opened my eyes to what good pho tastes like. Just great. Same goes with, well, everything else."}
{"text":"Was really craving some pho the other day!  Me and the SO decided to Yelp the closest place in the vicinity.  We arrived here and both ordered.  The waitress wasn't very cheery and we were both wondering if we did anything wrong to upset her.  On the other hand, when the food arrived, it was very tasty!    Overall the food was pretty good.  Service was a different story and overall I would give this place 3/5."}
{"text":"Great restaurant for a late night dinner since they close at 11 pm.   We ventured here since we were in the area and decided on a new place to eat through Yelp. The prices are considerably more then salad King but some of the portions are bigger like the green curry. Thought the rice was burned a little bit. My partner ordered the rice with chicken and pork that were a smaller cut then other restaurants. Even the appetizer was questionable at $10 that came to almost $1 a piece.   However that being said, the atmosphere was great and a very home family run restaurant."}
{"text":"Sure to tell everyone I've been a chef for 42 years I can taste and I'm seeing the cans in the kitchen. Knort swiss makes a pho powder as in base. Which is filled with charcoal I'm sorry I know what I mean but I don't have time to explain it chemicals and that's why it's so cloudy and thick. It's not made from scratch to make a consommé is made out of meat not bones this place uses powder. That's why my coeliac friend gets sick when she goes there it's not the rice noodle it's the broth. But sometimes you have to do what you have to do to survive"}
{"text":"This review is strictly on the Pho as I'm unwilling to try anything else off the menu after driving half way across the city for its delicious broth. I can honestly say that the broth at this Pho restaurant is my favorite in the city, you can really taste all the different spices used but none of them over power the other. I am a huge fan and recommend it to any true fan of Pho"}
