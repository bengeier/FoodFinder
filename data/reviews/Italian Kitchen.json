{"text":"This was the worst service I've ever had. The night started out by waiting for a server to notice us (they didn't have a host), told her we had a reservation, and she didn't even pretend to look for it. Told us to sit where ever we wanted. We proceeded to wait for 15 minutes or more for some one to notice us, before we got asked by what looked like the manager if any one had been with us yet. Took about 10 minutes to get the bottle of wine we asked for. Never did get bread or anything. Went to order our food, and then we were informed they were out of 3 things on the menu (which was a plain piece of paper with grease stains on it that was sitting on the table we chose ourselves)- there's only about 15 menu items- so we didn't get an appy, and changed our supper orders. Food was delicious when it came, chicken parmesan and chicken pasta. The parm looked like it was sitting under the heat lamp for quite a while, but juicy nonetheless. Our food was brought by a different girl, wearing jeans and Uggs. No one came to ask how our food was, so it's a good thing we didn't need any thing. The atmosphere was ok... we had to ask for 2/3 light bulbs above our table to be removed as we were roasting under them. The manager was kind enough to grab a napkin off another table so my husband could unscrew them.We would have had dessert if any one had asked.. But no one was around to get a menu from them. One section of the restaurant looked like they got decent-ish service- she probably doesn't smoke, as all 3 of the other girls working there were out smoking at the front door. We waited 15 minutes + for our bill after grabbing a waitress, but she never brought it or told any one, so we went off looking for someone to get it for us. We found the one server that was left inside in the kitchen, she got us our bill and took payment (yay!). We complained, but she never offered a manager or any sort of explanation, just \"I've heard that quite often tonight\". Fantastic. Also, every candle in the room was out, and after a customer complained, the manager took them out of the adjoining Gastropub i think. They looked like pub candles, not for something that's supposed to be a upscale restaurant in the heart of downtown. This was a Saturday night at 7pm... Appalling service, good food (the stuff that was in stock, anyway), and reasonable prices. We will never be back. I couldn't believe the reason we got such terrible service was because they were too busy all smoking at the same time (including the manager). There was about 5 tables in, could have easily been given great service but no one was interested in that, at all. I will be surprised if this place is in business by next year."}
{"text":"We didn't even make it past the drinks.  We walk into the place & there is not a soul in there save for the hostess.  We are seated at a table with menus printed from the home printer & dirty wine glasses.  The menu selection is weak. We waited nearly 15 minutes for the waitress to come take our drink order.  After reviewing the menu & noticing the horrid lack of cleanliness, we decide to leave after we got our drinks.  We waited nearly 20 minutes for our drinks, then we were informed that one of the wine orders would be longer because they had to get the wine out of the freezer!  Not impressed, to say the least!"}
{"text":"I went to a carb loading party tonight before the Calgary Marathon.  This was my first time at the Italian Kitchen, and I was impressed, and disappointed all at the same time.

What was disappointing:
- We distributed 130 tickets, to be served buffet style between 5-8 pm.  They ran out of food 1/3 of the way through the lineup and our group waited in line for 10 mins for more to show up
- when the first of three trays of pasta arrived 10 minutes later to a lineup of starving athletes, the server was eating.  She was chewing something with her hand over her mouth.

What i loved
- the ambiance - this restaurant is a classy looking place
- the serving staff i came into contact with were generally friendly and helpful
- the food was delicious.  They had 3 kinds of pasta, 2 salads and fresh bread. One ravioli, one bowties in a cream sauce and spaghetti.

In my opinion, I dont believe the kitchen staff that evening had experience with large groups.  They definately tried to accommodate, but the timing was a challenge.  Maybe this would be a better lunch or dinner spot, as opposed to event catering, because the pastas were very good."}
