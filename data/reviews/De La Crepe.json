{"text":"I thought this would be a nice cheery bakery to spend saturday mornings in. Quite the opposite, the ambience was sad and gloomy. The service also reflected that. Food was okay but hated the fact that food or drinks weren't  served in dish ware. If i wanted a to-go meal I would have just gone to Starbucks next door. Glad I tried it but I don't think ill be returning."}
{"text":"Brought a coupon from GROUPON, went to this place three times during their advised business hours 11am-8pm, always closed! What a scan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing special and horrible service.  Been there once and it was ok.  It was good enough for my wife to get a groupon when a deal showed up but we got busy and on the day it expired, I checked the website to see what time they were open til, got in the car and decided to treat my parents.  Except that when we got there, there was a sign saying that it would be closed on Mondays for the WINTER months.  Seeing as it was July, I was shocked as were the other two couples that were expecting to use their groupon as well.  
So when I called them the next day and told them, they blamed me for not using it earlier!  She may have a point but why would they expire their groupon on a day that they know that they're closed and not advertise that they are closed on Mondays??  There's false information on their storefront AND their website.  She gave me so much attitude on the phone as well so I'm very much never going there again and with this kind of customer service, I doubt they'll be open much longer."}
{"text":"Went back today after buying a Groupon.
It was very good . Very filling. Also tasty ."}
{"text":"I enjoy taking the kids here during the hot summer days. The AC always blasted, its a clean place, and they always have Yanni on screen while we enjoy a hot crepe..makes us feel like were in Greece lol (even though Crepes originated from the French). Its nothing special honestly, but sometimes the thought of skipping out on the crowd at Murphys is way better than their Icecream, OR going to the AC-less Swirls down the street. I can't say anything bad about them, Ive been happy everytime we've visited."}
{"text":"My fiance had bought a groupon for De La Crepe.  
It was the last day before the groupon expired and we went to go use it.  We went over an hour before closing time, and when we got to the store it was locked.  We saw someone inside cleaning, so we knocked on the door.  The staff came out and was extremely rude.  They were closing early and said they can do so because they feel like it.  We told them about our groupon and they said too bad and wouldn't let us use it, and said we can't use it in the future either.

We were so upset, we had to call groupon to get a refund.

We will never be going back here."}
{"text":"The crepes that my friend and I ordered were alright, nothing to write home about though. And I felt that they were a little overpriced for what they were. But, whatever... they were ok. 

What was certainly NOT ok was the service. The woman at the counter was extremely unfriendly and actually borderline rude. Enough so that I will not be returning and would never recommend this place."}
{"text":"Got a Groupon for $15 for $30 worth of crepes. My hubby got the savoury Supreme and I got the savoury Breakfast Break. They were both good but the Supreme was better in my opinion. We also got a desert crepe but it was just ok. Probably because I've had desert crepe before but I've never had savoury crepe until now and didn't know it can be that good. The lady that made our crepes did not hold back with the stuffings so they were really filling."}
{"text":"Since the groupon deals I have been going here quite a bit. The crepes are pretty good and the place is never busy so you can always find a seat. They will always play the same DVD of Yanni as music...2 years running now haha. I pretty much tried them all and the supreme I think is the best."}
{"text":"Pretty good crepes but only one worker meaning you have to wait FOREVER for your crepes. It's very irritating that you run in there wait forever to order then have to wait forever for your crepe to be ready. The creeps are pretty tasty but honestly the waiting ruins it."}
{"text":"Really friendly neighborhood joint. The crepe was fine but nothing too fancy. It was served as a wrap which makes it easy to take it to go but if you're sitting down to eat at the shop, it would be nicer to be served it on a plate. The coffee was really good actually , and the lady at the register was really sweet . Good place to hang out for a chat with a couple of friends."}
{"text":"Oh I like it here! Their crepes are crispy, like chips. But they weren't anything special though, and really small for $8+. Not very filling either. The only thing I like is the crispy crepe.

You order at the counter. No waitress service. Small tables. It was so quiet that it was awkward.... I couldn't really have a conversation because I felt they were secretly listening.

Drink + the crepe = like $15+ per person. Hmmmmmm not worth it... especially when the crepe is so small!"}
