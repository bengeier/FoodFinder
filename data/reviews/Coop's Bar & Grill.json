{"text":"gave my card to start a tab and when I wanted to leave they couldn't find my debit card. I contacted the owner JR Cooper and he wouldn't help. If you go there be careful.This is how they treat loyal customers. F*ucking idiots!"}
{"text":"My buddie turned me onto this place. By far the most solid on the west side can't believe there isn't a review already.great staff that make you feel at home and prices to reflect. Wish I would have found this place 3 years ago!"}
{"text":"Had dinner across the street and decided to check it out. Wasnt expecting much since just another dive bar but was pleasantly surprised. Pretty small place but very clean and amazing beer prices!!!  Large pitcher of blue moon only $8.00. Cant beat that price anywhere!!   Bartender super nice. Definitely check it out if in the peoria area!"}
{"text":"I actually like this little hole in the wall not much negative to say it is what it is a hole in the wall dive bar"}
{"text":"Dive bar on the west side of the tracks and Peoria.  For some reason I thought it closed because I saw boards on the windows.  A couple of pool tables and a bunch of neighborhood hood rats.  Even on a work night the place stays busy til closing.

The bartender didn't know how to make a whiskey sour so I ordered a beer.  Not a big deal but even a dive bar should know basic bartending 101.  

The music is hip hop classics which is right up my alley."}
{"text":"We love this place! The whole staff are awesome! They treat you like family! They know how to show their customer's a good time. Very respectful and they have a dance floor and a DJ every weekend! Love the drink specials! It's good time So if your in Peoria anytime you want to get out this would be a spot for a drink and a snack for the night or weekends you can do the whole club thing!  They have a kitchen so you can have something nice and full filling to go with whatever beer's you enjoy drinking. NICE PLACE!!!!"}
{"text":"D u m p. Scary, ratty, zero charm. I love dive bars. This was not a dive bar, this was a disaster. Example:  bathrooms are labeled \"chicks\" and \"dicks\". More duct tape than vinyl holding the seats and table tops together."}
{"text":"Couldn't figure out if this place for teens or strictly for Latinos. We arrived around 6-7, but DJ was setting up all Latin music only. I am not sure at all about \"grill\" part of a name .... Hmmm By the way, bartender girl was looking very odd and unfriendly. If I am paying , I need good service! Otherwise I will find another place for a couple drinks...."}
