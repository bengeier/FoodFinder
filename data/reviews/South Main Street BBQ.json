{"text":"Would love to support local businesses, especially a BBQ joint, but my wife and I were very disappointed. The meat was tender and lean which is something I'm looking for. Side dish choices were the staples (Mac, beans, slaw, chips, and sweet corn bread) nothing fancy which is what I would expect from a place focusing on the pig. Had a sweet and smoky ketchup based sauce, mustard, and spicy vinegar so you had options for topping your meat which is a bonus. However, nothing could resurrect the meat. Very watered down tasting. In fact it had very little flavor at all and no matter how much sauce I added I couldn't get it down. My wife and I threw both our plates away mid meal and got some pizza on the way home. From someone who loves BBQ and had heard good things I will be very reluctant to return. Hope it was a fluke but will certainly not be recommending it to my other BBQ loving friends."}
{"text":"I had the sampler platter, my wings were fall off the bone tender, but were a little more than warm. But had a good flavor. The BBQ was good but was barely 3 bites and I only had two ribs. They were good though. 
The cornbread was great and the mac n cheese was pretty good.
Wife got the brisket sandwich, decent flavor but was tough. 

Then the dessert, we got the coffee lovers ice cream cup. The ice cream was good but not $8 good. 

All in all food was probably about average for a BBQ joint, but pricey for portions."}
{"text":"Best brisket sandwich I've ever had. Highly recommend this BBQ.  My favorite BBQ was Bridges BBQ in Shelby NC now is JB's Lazy Pig BBQ. It's worth the drive."}
{"text":"The best BBQ I've had here in the greater Charlotte area since I moved here in 2001. I had the sampler plate with ribs, smoked chicken wings, and pulled pork. The ribs have a dry rub that is unique with flavorful spices while still being sweet at the same time. And the Mac & Cheese is stellar, with butter and real cheese throughout!

What truly made this place special is the kind and attentive service of the owners. They came by and talked with us several times showing they care about the customers and the food.

Oh and they have fresh ice cream frozen by liquid nitrogen! We didn't get to try it this time, but the kids behind us loved it. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I am not a big bbq fan but I loved their chicken. The cole slaw and corn bread was yummy as as well. It is a great place to bring the kids for ice cream as well. They make the ice cream right in front of you."}
{"text":"Horrible bbq, I had the chicken and it was so dry and flavorless. My husband and son had the ribs and they were so dry they didn't eat them.... We went when they first opened for the day and it seemed like they just microwaved what was leftover from the day before... Not going back"}
{"text":"By far the worst BBQ we have had since moving here in 2010. The pulled pork was dry and tasted like it was going bad, the buffalo wings literally had no taste whatsoever (definitely no buffalo flavor), and the ribs tasted like they were from a middle school cafeteria. The Mac n cheese and slaw were decent and the corn bread was actually pretty good. But the meat itself just wasn't good, the group of three of us who ordered three different meals all did not finish (not because of the portions which were average if not small) not sure where all these great reviews are coming from but it was unfortunately a disappointing experience and sadly the last experience we will have there."}
{"text":"One of the best places to get BBQ in the south side of Charlotte, incredible pulled pork and brisket witch is smoked on Saturdays and really good sides. And if you save room for desert they make they're own ice cream right in front of you with a nitrogen machine one of the coolest things I've seen. They also cater too."}
{"text":"Had the sampler (ribs, pork and wings) for lunch. Pork was very moist with good smoke flavor. The ribs were awesome. Full size pork ribs not baby back. Amazing rub that didn't need added sauce. The wings were interesting. I prefer fried wings but the smoke on these worked really well. 

Had the Mac-n-cheese for my side. It was amazing!!

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, just a tiny little restaurant. We dined in but the are only 3 tables inside so most people do take out. And the nitrogen ice cream is the BEST thing I've ever had... The chocolate flavor is creamy and delicious."}
{"text":"This review is for ice-cream only!

I don't often give 5 stars, but this place has earned it. Each serving is freshly made with liquid nitrogen right in front of you and it only takes a couple of minutes. Then the ice-cream itself taste so good. I have absolutely no complaints."}
{"text":"Unique ice cream great flavor. Bar b que good, sausage really good but could be grilled when cut open. Brisket tasted like a roast. Sides were good. Cheap chips and brownies.  A few changes could make it a good place"}
{"text":"Brought the kids for the ice cream and it was such a cool experience. They loved watching it being made from scratch using liquid nitrogen. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday for dinner.  Had the sampler and all was way over cooked and dry. Needed a lot of sauce.   Wet disappointed in the quality of the bbq. The ice cream was cool to watch but lacked taste of normal ice cream. 

The staff was super nice! Just wish the food was better."}
{"text":"Ordered take out on Friday evening. First time at this place and I would go back. Their ribs were delicious!  The meat pulled right off the bone. Delicious corn bread. We got the large ribs and the family meal which consisted of pulled pork (or chicken).  Did not try the pulled pork since I was full from the ribs. Buy hubby thought it was very good also. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely excellent. We had them cater my son's graduation party and everyone raved about how good the BBQ was. Ribs are phenomenal and the mac and cheese was great. They could not have been nicer when I got there to pick it up. One of the better BBQ joints we've had BBQ from"}
{"text":"Decided to stop by and pick up some wings and ribs to take home. I had previously tried, but they didn't have wings. I really wanted to like the food, but it was average at best. The ribs were ok, I just didn't get a great portion. The wings were disappointing. I was expecting some nice smoked wings. Instead I got mediocre buffalo wings with no smoke flavor. I hope this was not normal."}
{"text":"We have been here several times, the food was good but they need to do something about, their clients leaving their restaurant and smelling like they were the ones in the kitchen cooking their own food. Maybe it is a personal thing, but each time, I had to come home and take a shower, the smell was impregnated even in my hair. Disgusting and Sad. Either they do not exhaust the air from their kitchen properly or it is broken. Being around this industry, this tells me something is not right. If they would fix this problem, it would make it a pleasant please to have good barbecue and I would then give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped for ice cream! Super cool to watch and very good. Somewhat high on price but you can't expect cheap for this process. Nitro ice cream!"}
{"text":"The staff was nice and friendly and the food came out quick, but about the food. I ordered the smoked wings so this review only pertains to the wings. They were bad. Soggy and mushy without flavor. I smoke wings occasionally and do a much better job. I didn't eat all of them. Just enough to satisfy my hunger. The mac n cheese was good."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting family and were at the brewery across the street and decided on dinner.  We called JB's and they agreed to deliver to us at the brewery, which was super cool and convenient.  

We ordered the Family Pack, which served three kids, one toddler, and four adults...and we had plenty leftover!  The pulled pork was great, the bbq sauces were even better and the cornbread and sides were out of this world.  My favorites were the baked beans and the coleslaw.  We even had some non-coleslaw eaters who enjoyed it!  

The prices were extremely reasonable and the service was great!  This will definitely be a stop on our future trips to Waxhaw."}
{"text":"Bbq was delicious, baked beans were delicious, ice cream was delicious, and the staff was excellent! The owner even made an appearance and stopped by our table to ask how everything was and took some of our trash off the table. We will be back! And next time, I'm trying the ribs!

Update, the brisket isn't good! It's not tender or juicy. It also doesn't have any flavor. Stick with the BBQ because that's delicious!"}
{"text":"My boys and I came in today for the ice cream.  It was amazing.   The flavors were great but the science behind it was even better! We will be back - for ice cream and for bbq (the bbq smelled delicious and I wish we had planned to eat lunch there too!)"}
{"text":"OMG GOOD!!!!  It doesn't really matter WHAT you get here, it's all amazing!  Saturdays he makes fresh Beef Brisket (it goes fast it's so popular), the traditional BBQ pork is just fantastic & never dry, coleslaw amazing, collard greens fresh, yummy cornbread, and the chicken wings are fantastic too - our 12 year old can eat like 20!!!

ALSO - they make 'Nitrogen Ice Cream' here which is SOOOOOOOOO YUMMY! And for the kiddos, it's just plain cool to watch them make it, like a Harry Potter magic trick.  And for parents who love 'all-natural wholesome food' everything here is just that.....and the ice cream they make with heavy cream + sugar and only add the flavor you like - that's it! It's SO rich and creamy (add yummy toppings too!).

We also had JB's cater a party for us and it was EASY, AFFORDABLE and everyone raved about the food!

Very small seating area, it's a tiny place so it's better to eat just outside at the outdoor seating, but it can get busy at certain times so be patient - it's worth the wait for any menu item! Note: They are closed Mondays & Tuesdays --- wish they weren't (just for the summer!!!)!"}
{"text":"We had JB'S cater our party last weekend and they did an excellent job!  We ordered pulled pork, BBQ Chicken, baked beans, slaw, and an assortment of sauces.  

They delivered and set up the chafing pans with sterno and got everything ready for our guests.  We were very pleased with the service and our guests loved the food!  

Jim was a pleasure to deal with and offers great value for his food & service!"}
{"text":"Union County's best BBQ, maybe the best in the state. The brisket is my favorite. It's a small, quaint BBQ joint that always smells like love. They also have liquid nitrogen ice cream, which is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great food. Fast service. And the nitrogen ice cream is not only cool to watch but delicious to eat."}
{"text":"We have stopped in the JB's for the delicious ice cream several times and were excited when the BBQ finally opened. 

Stopped in with my husband not long after they opened and had some ribs. They were pretty good. Not the best ribs I've ever had but I would order them again. We liked the different sauces very much.

I kept seeing rave reviews for the brisket on FB so I decided to give it a try. It smelled heavenly in the store when I placed my order (I ordered 2 pounds of brisket, thinking that would be enough for 7 people, plus maybe leftovers). I was a little shocked by how much it cost, but then when the food is good I don't mind splurging occasionally.

When I got home and opened the bag my mouth was watering. Couldn't wait to taste that brisket! It didn't seem like we got 2 full pounds of brisket and it didn't seem like enough to feed 7 people, although the lady who took our order assured us it would be. 

I couldn't wait to taste it. Didn't even bother getting a bun, just grabbed a fork and took a bite. I was SOOOOOOO disappointed. It was dry, tough and had little flavor. I thought, okay maybe that was a burnt end, I know a lot of people love that, but it's not exactly my favorite. Took another bite and nope, no taste, dry and tough. I can't tell you how sad I was to smell this amazing scent of brisket and to taste what I can only describe as old shoe leather. 

We will be back for the amazing ice cream, but I won't be ordering the brisket."}
{"text":"We heard about the brisket that only served on the weekends. It is outstanding!!  Friendly service and the owner is very nice and interested in how we liked the experience.  My wife got the ribs and refused to share with me.  I guess that's a really good sign of good bbq."}
{"text":"This is a take out review for JB's Lazy Pig BBQ.

Ordered BBQ pork for lunch. Being a road warrior it is kind of fun when you are stopping in to grab a bite to eat before running into the next appointment or event. Also, grabbing a cup of coffee to stay awake on the road with little sugar treat for a pick me up through out the day.

Finally, opened boxed lunch. One side is the BBQ pulled pork. It was not smothered in BBQ sauce which was good. Wondered where the bread was which was not in the box which was okay. Thought, I ordered a sandwich. Nice heaping portion of BBQ pulled pork. The mac-n- cheese is delicious.Creamy and chewy.

It's a surprise every time I go an order BBQ pork for I do not know what to expect. some places it is smothered in vinegar sauce, other places sweet sauce. It's an adventure getting take out and opening a big surprise.

Will be back to this establishment to try out their nitrogen ice cream.

Staff attentive and helpful. Very good food..."}
{"text":"This recent addition to the Waxhaw, NC food scene is a great addition for sure.  Fabulous pulled pork, chicken and ribs bbq with terrific house made bbq sauce to go along. 
Very smal space with both inside and outside seating... right next door to Maxwells Tavern, arguably the best restaurant in Waxhaw.
Excellent flavor... good value and very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Just beyond Maxwell Tavern at the corner of S. Providence St and East South Main St (Hwy 75)).

Like most of Waxhaw, JB's is closed on Mondays during the summer (May - October) and also closed on Tuesdays during the winter.  Small but has some tables inside and a few more outside.

They serve sandwiches and platters  and a selection of sides.  Pretty standard Southern fare.  What will be fun is that they will serve beef brisket on Saturdays!  So pulled pork, smoked sausage, racks of ribs whole and half chickens and buffalo wings.

Sides include mac n cheese and cornbread in addition to coleslaw, baked beans and bread.

In addition, they took over the ice cream shop which used to be there serving LN2 ice cream.

We did a quick BBQ sandwich and it was excellent.  Will have to go back for a more thorough munch through the menu.

Great addition to Waxhaw."}
{"text":"Went back again today and it was just as good as last time.  Had pulled pork sandwich.   The rolls they serve it on are fresh and awesome.   Tried the handmade icecream and it was the best ice cream I have ever had.  sooooo smooth and creamy.   You have to try it !!"}
{"text":"Went here while visiting family.  I ordered the sampler, came with 2 ribs- tender but not much flavor, tasted boiled; 3 chicken drumettes- menu read wings, but received wing pieces; and pulled pork- just ok. My son ordered greens for his side- very bland. Sauce tasted okay- might be bottled. Gave 3 stars because the staff are really nice."}
{"text":"Ordered online. Was ready when I got there. Staff was friendly. Food was hot. Side portions were fair. The BBQ wasn't my #1 favorite across the country but it was very good. The spicy vinegar sauce is a bit bland. You can definitely tell it's vinegar based. I mixed it with some sauce we had from Frontier Meats on Hwy200 and it was awesome. I would definitely recommend this BBQ joint."}
{"text":"Amazing place. Definitely some of the best BBQ. Highly recommend you visit. Owner is a great guy too!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here with four adults and four kids on a First Friday...Maxwells had a 30 min wait so we decided on BBq...we are glad we did! The
Family platter gave us more than enough pork, corn bread, chips and sides (the best Mac n cheese my six year old said!) we are returning later for the nitro ice cream!"}
{"text":"So friendly. Amazing freshly made ice cream.  BBQ is yummy too! Check it out!  You won't be disappointed!
Closed on Mondays!"}
{"text":"We ate in and were served quickly. Had amazing pulled pork sandwiches which included pickles on the side. The sandwiches were overflowing with meat. My son wanted a hot dog but it's really a sausage or a bratwurst, he wasn't fooled and wouldn't eat it, we did and it was good. Very casual and very small dining area. We want to go back and try their ice cream in the Spring."}
{"text":"My wife and I got the BBQ platter here and did enjoy the food. Although, the you can find better southern BBQ elsewhere in the area. The highlight was the ice cream they make with the nitrous. Our kids absolutely loved the ice cream and thought the way it was made was so cool. They only have the one size which is a great portion."}
{"text":"This was the first visit for us.  It is located at the street corner right across from the bridge.

I got the \"Texas\" brisket, which they only serve on Saturdays, and it is one of the best that I have had in North Carolina(I have lived in Texas).  It has a sweet rub that gives it a nice flavor and it was tender. In Texas, I liked when I had the option to purchase lean brisket. 

Hubby got the pulled pork platter and liked the three bbq sauces(sweet, mustard, vinegar).  

We had the macaroni and cheese side which was very good.  I gave them back the chips because I am not a fan of the plain lays that they provide with the meal.  The cornbread is very sweet and almost reminds me of a yellow cake.  

We indulged and got the ice cream which is frozen by liquid nitrogen while you watch.  That was really \"cool.\"  It tasted pretty good, too."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  The nitrogen ice cream is a little slow to make but fun to watch being made.  You get what you pay for.  Not the cheapest but excellent quality."}
{"text":"By far the worst BBQ we have had since moving here in 2010. The pulled pork was dry and tasted like it was going bad, the buffalo wings literally had no taste whatsoever (definitely no buffalo flavor), and the ribs tasted like they were from a middle school cafeteria. The Mac n cheese and slaw were decent and the corn bread was actually pretty good. But the meat itself just wasn't good, the group of three of us who ordered three different meals all did not finish (not because of the portions which were average if not small) not sure where all these great reviews are coming from but it was unfortunately a disappointing experience and sadly the last experience we will have there."}
{"text":"The brisket (only served on Saturdays) was incredible. The rub has a great kick to it.. it was fork tender and I personally liked the way it tasted with the sweet sauce (my wife felt the same way about its interaction with the mustard sauce). The brisket was too spicy for my six year old, so the owner brought out some mac n cheese on the house and let her try the pork for our next trip there... the pork was fantastic! The beans were tasty but a little dry.. personally I would have added some sweet bbq sauce to the recipe, but he does put in pulled pork which is very nice. The slaw is excellent... none of that vinegary, sauerkraut style of slaw... nice and wet with mayo/vinegar dressing.

It's a little BBQ place.. if you go here expecting china and fine cutlery, you don't know what great BBQ really is.. and I suggest you never go to the legendary places in Texas or Dreamland in Tuscaloosa because your level of disappointment will border on comical. We are moving close to Waxhaw real soon and this place will be on constant rotation for us!"}
{"text":"Husband and I ate here for the first time and loved it! Who knew Waxhaw had this hidden gem. Staff is very friendly, offered great suggestions and brought the food out to us.
We had the brisket (only available on Saturday's) it was so tender and had the best flavor! The cornbread tastes like cake and the wings and Mac and cheese were out of this world!
Will def be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ, the sweet sauce is my favorite. Fast service, always polite and the best ice cream. Always love stopping here."}
{"text":"We would give it 10 stars if we could !!
The best BBQ and ice cream we have ever had !!!
We are from CT and will make this an every visit stop. 
A must go to place to eat !!!
Awesome !!!!"}
{"text":"Very good BBQ. Sides were all great and homemade. Even the Nitro ice cream was delicious. Some of the best BBQ I've had in Charlotte. I definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Very nice place to stop by. Sausage platter was very good. All the food I tried was nice. The Nitro Ice cream was a hit. Cheerwine on fountain!!!  The Wonderfully friendly service from the Ladies (sister & niece of the owner) was what brings people back. I will def stop next time we're in town. Thanks again."}
{"text":"Awesome barbeque!  Limited seating inside but there are picnic tables outside.  Great location right in the middle of downtown Waxhaw. The employees there were great."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Chicken literally falls off the bone. Great sides too! Highly recommend for good ole southern BBQ!"}
{"text":"Fantastic ice cream made to order using a liquid nitrogen system. It is almost as much fun watching them make your personal ice cream as it is to eat it.
The staff could not be more accomodating and the ice cream goddess, Hailey, went out of her way to make our ice cream and visit the best it could be.
I went with a group of people and most of us ordered traditional BBQ entrees. One member of our party ordered the smoked turkey leg and it was the best of the lot."}
{"text":"Decent bbq, I support local business so I will continue to eat here. The prices are a little high and not your usual NC bbq. Brisket is good, ice cream is mediocre."}
{"text":"wonderful BBQ and service.  In the heart of downtown Waxhaw.  the ice cream was delicious."}
{"text":"Pretty decent pork BBQ. It had a good smokey flavor but was still moist, unlike some other BBQ joints in the area. Decent sized portions as well. Really good mac n cheese! Cornbread was excellent as well. They also make their own ice cream, but we were too full to try it. Will definitely have to next time!"}
{"text":"Quick service, great barbecue and even better house made liquid nitrogen ice cream. Will definitely be coming back in the future!"}
