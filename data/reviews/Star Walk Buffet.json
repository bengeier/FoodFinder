{"text":"Super expensive, and nothing to eat. The worst buffet I ever had in Toronto. never visit again. do not waste ur money."}
{"text":"Hey There, I gotta say that it is my first time having buffet at Star Walk. Last night, I was invited by a manager for a dinner night with various consuls of different countries in Latin America. There are not so much to say about the typical environmental feeling of the restaurant because it was just like i was expected to see. Furthermore, the service is great but a little \"over service\" why? well, There was two pieces of sushi on a plate that i havent finished yet. I was taking a rest cuz my stomach was so full and the waiter came by and tried to get out of my way the plate. I said to him, \" hold on, i havent finished yet.. hey dude dont be rush.. \" I didnt hav a problem with the service part, and it is right what he did, he was just doing his work right. I truly understand.. but its cool.. it was a tremendous night, we rented the ballroom and all latin american students were present from different part of the world.. I did not hav the chance to meet all of them, but a couple of them was cool.. there is not much to say again.. i hope i hav a chance to be there again.."}
{"text":"Went there for weekend lunch.

First impression: nice decor! Didnt expect it from the exterior which was raher drab.  High ceilings accentuated by crystals. Buffet setup came with different sections for sushi, noodles, fried Chinese stuff, dimsum, dessert, choco fountain, noodle soup, Mongolian. (am sure there were other sections but going off memory here)

I came for the dimsum and dessert, and thought those by themselves were worth the trip. Dimsum had diff types of har gow, siumai, intestines (too bad, there was no lo mai kai). Dessert was great with a wide selection of cakes (more than other buffets and seems of better quality- not trying to kill u with sweetness). Loved that they had a choco fountain, stocked w strawberries and mallows. I didnt notice the slushie/juice section (beside the choco fount) till i was too full, but the number of flavors looked interesting.

Other things i tried: noodle soup with satay beef- pretty good. Noodles seemed handmade in texture. Wife tried the tomato and fish noodle soup and thought i was good too. Sushi selection was fair and better than other Chinese buffets i've been to. There were a lot of Chinese dishes and looked good (didnt seem too greasy and seemed fresh, but didnt try out that part of the spread). What i would try in the future are the fish ball/meatballs cooking station - reminded me of street foods in prior visits to China that i was too chicken to try out. 

Heard they've changed management recently, thus the massive renovation, and new cuisine. Havent been here before this visit but judging fr prvious reviews, theymust have done a good job updating the food (and service). Good thing coz would be to bad if the food didnt match the nice decor.

Service was efficient but not rude like other Chinese places. 

Last note: i always do the bathroom test (clean restroom = clean kitchen) when i go to Chinese restos and this one passed the test. 

Price was standard Chinese buffet price, 15.99 for wkend lunch. Thought it was a good deal considering the spread and the fact that the food and ambiance is a notch above its peers.
 
Will definitely return to try out other dishes, stations."}
{"text":"The Grand re-opening seemed really modern which I really liked.
The food was .. not as good as I hoped. Really wasn't up to the value when it came to the quality of foods. There's a variety and they look great, but when you eat them, they aren't always hot nor are they always tasting good. 

Overall experience wasn't as good as I hoped it would be. The food could really be stepped up or their prices should be marked lower. Shouldn't be paying a higher amount of money for a cheaper quality of foods."}
{"text":"I always hear people complaining about this place. But to me, it is not that bad!
When you first walk in you notice it is pretty big, plus their are free pop! Taste wise, the food isn't that bad as well! Certainly been to better places but it is not the worst!"}
{"text":"I didn't know that a change ownership took place. I haven't been to this place for quite sometime and it was really good back then. I was very excited coming here but was very disappointed with the food. All I can say is, save your money and go else where. This place is dead to me. I'm surprised to see a few people showing up. Maybe they're like me, not knowing tho place has changed. 

Service is good but food is terrible. Peking duck was a disaster. Roast beef was dry and it looks like it has been sitting there all day.  DISAPPOINTING."}
{"text":"Every time I go up to Markham, I always end up here...and each and every time, it's nothing special.

This buffet is very convenient - still on the TTC line (not having to switch and stops right in front of the plaza, making the walk bearable), near P-Mall, and Market Village (I hope that's what it's called..). 

The food  makes me sick every time. My best friend actually lives in Markham and for some reasons, we always come back even after we said we will not. I guess the price of the buffet is just very attractive...

But, in the end, we learnt from our mistakes (many time) and I will not return to this buffet. 

BTW, I always judge a restaurant for the cleanness of their bathroom...and this place is unpredictable. Sometimes it's pretty clean and sometimes, it's the grossest place ever...just saying."}
{"text":"Starwalk (Scarborough) is in the hands of a new owner. (not the owner of Woo's, which also closed down) and it will re open at the end of April 2012 after some renovation. I look forward to giving them a chance when they re-open!"}
{"text":"This is the only Chinese buffet that I go to often.  Even though there is nothing spectacular about it.   The food are pretty good, lots of choices including Sashimi and Sushi.  You do have to pay for drinks, of course water is always free and they always keep your glass filled.  Service is great!   I would recommend it and as I said, nothing spectacular, just a decent buffet."}
{"text":"Since they changed ownership, everyting went straight downhill. Food was very unfresh and tasteless. Service was bad. The place was like a cafeteria. I won't even let my dog eat there."}
{"text":"To be honest I am awed by the positive reviews made for this buffet. I have definitely had better. I went to dinner at Starwalk when it was first open (which was a while back) and my family and I had a terrible experience. The food is nothing exceptional, it'd be unfair for me to say it was horrible, but it definitely was not great. The thing that made my family shun this restaurant is actually the customers at Starwalk. Because of the low prices, the crowd there for some reason seemed to really want to take advantage and would literally swarm towards the more expensive items. My fam and I do not enjoy fighting for our food, so we never returned for dinner. However this was a long time ago, so to be fair, I will also document a more recent exp.

For my high school grad luncheon (last summer) we decided to have lunch at starwalk (largely b/c my school is extremely cheap!) Now the fried foods were soggy, the selection (since it was lunch) was VERY limited, and as for the dim sum, I'd rather have that at an actual dim sum place.  I think the dessert area was what prevented me from one starring this place simply because that was the only thing that pleased me with it's wide array of western/chinese desserts. However speaking of dessert, I must get to the primary reason why I have low scored this buffet. There is whip cream set out for people to put on there waffles and such. It has clearly been left out for a long time, so I avoided it like the plague knowing that dairy spoils easily. Unfortunately my friends weren't so smart, some ate the cream, and told me the day after that they got sick from the experience. In my opinion, NO RESTAURANT that you pay to eat at should make you sick. Period. 

Definitely not going to return to this buffet. I rather pay more for food somewhere else."}
{"text":"I find the quality is on a downward trend in recent years. Tends to be greasy with poorer food quality. I would probably go with 1.5 stars."}
{"text":"Starwalk Buffet is by far the worst buffet I have ever been to!  Absolutely terrible! 

One of my first observations was that their fabric chairs were very dirty.  I attempted to find cleaner chairs at my table, but to no avail. 

There really isn't that much food. 

The sushi was acceptable and the raw salmon were quite good, but their soy sauce was of poor quality. 

The food items staffed by chef were fairly bad, and disappointed me.  I custom ordered a wonton noodle, and instead of receiving a wonton, which is comprised of grounded up meat and shrimp in a wonton wrap, I received what tasted like a Chinese meatball in a wonton wrap.  A Chinese meatball in a wonton wrap is not a wonton... 

The meat for the peking duck is supposed to be fairly fatty with some meat underneath the crispy skin.  At Starwalk, the meat was almost entirely meat with some crispy skin and a tiny layer of fat.  And, yes..., I did what I wasn't supposed to do, which is to sift through the food.  I think this is because the meat was cut incorrectly. 

Some of the food items that are meant to be hot were cold (ie. chicken wing, fried chicken ball).  A cold chicken wing is a bad chicken wing!  Some foods are meant to be eaten hot!  If not hot; at the very least, warm.  On the other end, the ice cream was obviously too warm because it was far, far too soft and mushy. 

It is strange to see fruit slushy and popcorn being offered at a buffet...  I'm not even sure what to make of this...  But it immediately raised a red flag in my head.  I'm aware of the reason management is offering these items and that they are directed to a certain demographic, but they should have been more subtle with wanting their customers to eat more junk food and less of the more expensive items.  There motive is far too obvious and made me wonder where else they would try to use a similar approach to save a few bucks.  Oh, I know!  The dirty chairs!

I understand their restaurant closes at 10:00 PM, but when chefs begin to prepare to close by cleaning the kitchen and stop cooking

I understand their restaurant closes at 10:00 PM, but when chefs prepare to close by cleaning the kitchen and stop cooking, the message conveyed is that food quality and quantity can fall and it won't matter to anyone, but myself.  If similar activities took place in a restaurant where I place orders through a menu, I would probably not know they're about to close...

I have never left a buffet semi-full...  They only received one star because their staff cleared plates very quickly, the environment was rather nice, the real turtles near their front entrance, and how I could watch CityPulse 24 while I eat."}
{"text":"Where do Elder Chinese Groups hang-out??  STAR WALK!  Everytime I go on a weekday afternoon I see they overrun the dining area as well as the PRIVATE area but man do they know how to throw a party or what?!  I sometimes want to jump in and bust-a-move with some ladies.

The food is ACCEPTABLE and in some items you can even see caters to the older crowd.  The Sushi Counter is always FULL as I barely see anyone half my age around.  I think I might be dipping into week-old wasabi.  The younger crowd goes to Wasabi/Cafestra next door.

As a Buffet this is not that bad, but not that great either.  The VALUE is actually relatively good and that's why Seniors tend to come here because they get Seniors DISCOUNT.  It's almost cheaper than going for DIM SUM and there's more variety.  

Be careful as PARKING here can sometimes be tough and you might have to park in the back and walk up front.  It's considered walking distance for me, from Pacific Mall but I've never attempted that YET.

I can't wait until I get MY Senior's Discounts."}
{"text":"I'm not a very big person so buffets are obviously not my first choice in meals. But this place is awesome. When it first opened it was one of a kind. They served dim sum, sushi and of course the conventional Chinese buffet choices of noodles, rice, veggies and more. 

The place is huge so having a large party there is no problem at all. They even have an area that you can separate for privacy. The price is decent and the food is good. Mandarin has got nothing on this place. Actually, I really dislike the Mandarin and will always choose this place over it. 

For dinner they even have salmon sashimi in their Japanese section. There are so many choices to eat that you won't know where to begin and end. This is a must try and definitely worth the money and the extra weight."}
{"text":"We've eaten here a few times now. Dim sum is usually ok. Sushi can vary. Overall quality is on par with every other buffet I've had in the past twenty years. IOW, its passable."}
{"text":"A popular local buffet restaurant that's been generating a crowd for a long time, Star Walk has quite an impressive Dim Sum buffet selection during the day.  As for the evening, this place has a wide variety of foods to serve to its clientele. Though i am not a big fan of buffets due to its questionable freshness, I figured it was time to YELP it since I've been coming here for years. 
The food is about a 3/5 and their Sashimi salmon didn't look fresh at all... however everything else was edible.
The service was exceptional, however the noise level can be quite an annoyance depending on what time you visit."}
{"text":"I was here are the Grand re-Opening in the summer 2012 under new ownership. Amazing renovation, over $1Million I heard. Big difference from when I was there in 2010. And what fanfare of distinguished guests were present! The food was authentic Chinese as told to me by my friends, delicious. Fresh ingredients and great value. It's right across from Pacific Mall, so it will make a great stop for my family & I in the future while I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Impressive buffet, there were so many selections-- Sushi, yakitori, Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese, and Western food

Below are few that made an impression:
- several types of soup: 
   shark fin, fish tummy, etc ( I was totally full when I discover them so didn't try any
- dessert selection :
  ice cream, Chinese desserts, cake, cream buff, sweet tofu, red bean soup ( I wasn't able to try them all :)
- unique dishes:
   They have stirred fry deer meat, and bbq pork neck meat;  I mostly had these only in Asia

Overall I am quite impress with the quality and selection!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food and service. There is a section where you can get your own drinks and they included the slushy drinks too but they were far too sweet. T

I haven't been to Starwalk since before the renovation and the decor is really nice but that's as far as I can compliment it. 

Food was just average and wasn't over the top, I definitely wouldn't come back again."}
{"text":"food here tends to be inconsistent but generally you always leave full. Never been for dinner but lunch is pretty good has a good selection of dim sum items"}
{"text":"I am NOT a fan of buffet. I just cannot handle all you can eat, since I want to try everything so I end up overeat! However, I don't mind going to Star Walk once in awhile.

There are so many choices of food here! We have a party last Sunday with over 20 people and that includes people from different nationality (Chinese, Filipino, Canadian, Russian, Hungarian) and they all enjoy the food there! It is so hard to please everyone but with the food selections here they all find something they like to eat.

There are Chinese Northern dishes peking duck/dumplings/buns/spicy fishes, Japanese sushi/cold noodles/sashami, Cantonese stir fried veg/meat/fish/rice/noodles/lobsters/chicken , Vietnamese grilled meat, desserts fresh fruits/cakes/icecream/sweet soup..

The service is ok, nothing to write home about.

However, I would rather order a la carte from a restaurant over eating at a buffet. I like the taste of food just fresh and steaming hot from the wok! And of course it is more hygienic than people picking through the buffet!

There are sometimes coupons online that give you $1 or $2 discount. They do accept Interac, Visa and MC."}
{"text":"I have been to all different levels of buffets and this place is average.  I have been here on multiple occasion, mostly because its the easiest place to go for a quick lunch and have something everyone can enjoy.  The place is huge and usually there is some form of event going (whether its a birthday party or a wedding...).  The buffet areas is larger, there are choices of sushi, salad bar, Dim sum and dessert.

In terms of taste, the food is only mediocre.

This place is good for group gathering or quick lunches."}
{"text":"A little of background information:

I've been to Star Walk Buffet many times before the renovation and my experiences have always been poor so I stopped going. Then I heard a family member saying the lunch wasn't so bad this time he went. What a joke. I ended up going sometime middle of last year for dinner on a weekend. It was one of my worst buffet experiences ever.

Pros: Slushies! I've never been to a buffet where they offered it. Their \"make-your-own\" noodles was hot and the broth was great. Very spacious restaurant with average service.

Cons: Just about all the other food. The selection was extremely poor. I regretted coming as soon as I saw how much food there actually was. The quality of food was even more disappointing. It was cold and not tasty at all. Even the soup was bad. There weren't a lot of people that night so I could see why they were not making the same quantity of food as usual, but it was just completely unacceptable to me. 

Please don't settle for such low quality food. Just about any other buffet I've been to has been a far better experience."}
