{"text":"We continue to find the Spring Garden a reliable and decent family place.  We have taken numerous friends and family there and have always found it welcoming.
The owners, of Albanian origin, are diligent and doing their best to make this a good place to dine, and, in our opinion, are succeeding.
I must admit that our most frequent attendance is for Friday night fish fry, and we have always found it abundant and well done.  Our favorite is a pan fried Walleye that will rival any in Wisconsin, or Minnesota.  These people want to please and are certainly responsive to any requests.  Local waitresses help to give the place a friendly atmosphere.
We have tried some of their other offerings, and have not found them wanting.  We have noted some other reviews that seemed unfriendly to the management, but have noted none of the objections that they have in our dining at the Spring Garden.  We have been there well over a dozen times in the four years we have lived in the region and are willing to drive the 15 miles that it takes to eat here, rather than in some closer establishments.
To us, the atmosphere is reminiscent of the old Crystal Cafe in Reading PA, a Greek restaurant that we enjoyed almost 40 years ago."}
{"text":"Me and my family ate here last night and I must say it was wonderful. It was my first time here so I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. Two of my cousins from Nebraska said their fish meals were some of the best they have ever had. I had a 7oz Sirloin and was cooked perfectly! As the rest of my family was ordering dessert, I chose a chocolate martini they had on special and it was pretty good. I thought the service was excellent, and it was a nice clean family restaurant. 
Overall, everybody was happy and we would go back."}
{"text":"Reviewing this for what it is, only, with no high expectations, I still can't bring myself to give it more stars.  Odd atmosphere, bad food, and for the love of god, do NOT use their bathroom! 

Our waitress was very nice.  My soda tasted very watered down.  They don't actually have Leinie's, although they have it on their menu.  The menu, like others have noted, is extensive.  This is never a good sign. How can a place offer that many options and do them well?  This is one of those places where your best bet is probably going to be the special--at least it will hopefully be somewhat fresh.

Not taking my own advice, I ordered the Reuben.  I've had many different reubens at many different places--it's my standby.   Most are average to good, and I've been to a couple places where they are amazing.  Theirs was, in a word, bad.  Strange-tasting bread, very little (and questionable) sauerkraut, plastic-y and tasteless Swiss, nasty meat, and the most disgusting dressing I've ever had--watery and oddly sweet, tasting nothing like thousand island.  But the worst part may have been the bread, which tasted like it was smothered with rancid butter and toasted on a grill that has never been cleaned.  

Okay, what about the rest of the food?  Canned, boxed, frozen, re-constituted are a few words that come to mind.  The most edible thing was the side salad, which was crisp with fresh vegetables--just skip the rancid croutons.

So: Friendly and efficient staff; Memorably bad food."}
{"text":"Yeah.  Ginormous Menu.  Non-memorable food.

I've been here a couple of times since moving to Mount Horeb.  I can't really even remember what I ordered the last time.  The decor is dated/weird, the service is OK, but the food quality needs to go up a bit.

They are making some renovations, maybe changes to the menu will be on tap soon as well."}
{"text":"A couple years ago it wasn't so bad, lots of Sysco food was served on your plate. But recently returned and almost vomited in the parking lot when we left. The place is family owned and is the staff is the owners/cooks children (which isn't always a bad thing) but the oldest that waited on us stunk SUPER bad of BO so bad and was dressed as if he just rolled out of bed in sweat pants and wrinkled shirt. The place is so greasy dirty, the carpeting was filthy, the windows are all fogged over, there is just nothing worth cheering about. The place is falling apart and is going to take more than just the kids to fix it up. I had several stomaches and diarrhea through out the day. Never going to return."}
{"text":"They understand breakfast! Good food and service.  Reasonably priced.  I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very affordable, but you get what you pay for. The food is average at best...but the soup is usually pretty great! Staff ehhh if you're lucky you'll get a sweet waitress."}
{"text":"The \"Mexican Omelette\" (sic) I had here was tasteless.  There's really no other word for it. The ingredients and texture gave the impression that everything they serve here is processed and reconstitued from frozen food.  Everything was lifeless and flavorless."}
{"text":"Stopped there for a small family get together around 11am. The good news is the staff was very friendly, and the cost was reasonable. 
Bad news is the minute we walked in we were overwhelmed with a strong smell of mildew. Big turn off. I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs. Eggs came cold, steak was overcooked. Texture was if they just took it out of the freezer and put it in the microwave. It was gross. When we got home it was a race for the bathroom. Need I say more? Won't be back."}
{"text":"Very extensive menu. I can't even remember all the stuff that was on there, but we hit them at dinner time and that meant that we could order from any page on the menu, including breakfast. It took us a while to read it all and decide. I had a pizza burger, which was pretty good. We also got some slices of pie/cake for dessert, and they were delicious."}
{"text":"Food was just o.k. Had the ocean perch , the dessert that came with dinner for free was rice pudding.it was watery,like it had been sitting there for a long while.Iv'e had better."}
{"text":"maybe it was the amazing waitress. Or the crispy hash browns with onions and cheese? or was it the golden Chinese cheese curds? but then it might have been the delicious 12 ounce new YOrk strip. Outstanding. A full menu of great options. The Italian at the nearby table looked scrumptious too. I mean the spaghetti and bot the brunett. Only thing I didn't care for was the stir fried veggies. Too overcooked and dry. This place is unique as its decor.  LOVED IT!"}
{"text":"Really really friendly, considerate staff. Great service. The food is Ok and the place seems very clean."}
{"text":"Large Menu reminds me of New York Diners.
Decor is a little humourous with the chandeliers and booths, but why not.
The staff last night was very friendly, returned often, and refilled drinks quickly.
We ordered the fish fry and salad.  I don't have a real high expectation here, but it was good.  Gyros, salads, sandwiches.  I have been here for breakfast and is was  good and simple.  
Our kids ordered hot chocolate and got a huge glass mug with good hot cocoa and lots of whipped cream.  Kids meals are perfect, with mini burgers and fries, kid size chicken alfredo and our daughter loves their chicken fingers.
Overall, we'll go back for the service and variety of food."}
{"text":"Very good diner.  My family and I hit it up on the weekend's for breakfast or late lunches at least once a month.  Staff is always friendly and service has been great, especially with kids.  Breakfasts are very good with the standard breakfast fare and priced very reasonable, don't feel bad adding that extra order of bacon or pancakes.  

Lunches are also pretty standard fare for a diner but taste great and the prices again are very reasonable.  The only thing keeping it from being a 5 star in my mind is just the fact that it is a standard diner, no frills, no interesting twists on anything, but very solid."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, the food is good and it is reasonably priced. It's our family's go to breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Went with a Groupon.  I asked the server and she said Groupon was ok.  When checking out the lady barely knew about Groupon.  She had incredibly long research session about what Groupon is.  

Finally they rejected because the number of people does not match.  

Food was below average...  will never go back..."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now and not very impressed. Smells when you walk in and looks dated and tables are cluttered. The chopped steak tasted like a bad burger. Waitress are not to personable."}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast places on Sundays (we've actually made it a tradition). Their eggs Benedict is my go to dish, as you can only get it on Saturdays and Sundays. Service is always awesome and no matter how busy it is the food is always quick and hot.

I will say...it took us a year to eat here when we first moved to mount horeb because it is not exactly appealing from the outside, but I can definitely says it's one of our favorites. It's not fancy, but it gets the job done!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a very odd restaurant with a huge menu.  The huge menu made me a little leery, but both our meals were good and the service was good.  We both got sandwiches, they both came with fries.  Simple stuff, but the fries were the best I have had.  And while I was thinking this, the person I was eating with said the same thing.  Our grasshopper for dessert was delicious as well.  We would go back here."}
{"text":"Are here for the first time the other night. Ordered a Reuben sandwich with some onion rings. Also ordered the 3 different fried cheese curds platter. 

All the food was fresh and tastes good. 

I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"You could eat at Spring Garden, or you could just pay the guy dropping off food from the Cisco truck $5 for a sample and save yourself the time.  There is nothing original or tasty about the Spring Garden menu.  The only positive thing I can say about them is that they participate in the community fund raisers."}
{"text":"while visiting family, stopped here for brunch. delicious food, quick service, unbeatable prices. i don't know if it was my 9 mile morning run or sleepless body, but this food sent me away replenished and wishing i could eat more! my family chose breakfast meals. biscuts n gravy, belgian blueberry waffles toppled with whip cream and one more biscuts gravy sausage and eggs dish. i opted for the gyros. i needed meat and going for steak would have been too much for me. we ate outside in the spacious patio area. th menu contained so many dishes, it was hard to choose. i'll have to go back for seconds."}
{"text":"Nothing special at all.  Old dingy place that makes you question how clean the kitchen is and if you are going to get sick eating the food.  Service is not friendly.  Don't even try to use a Groupon you may have purchased here.  They will make up stipulations that don't match anything the Groupon says and then will not honor your Groupon.  Avoid this place and head to Sun Prairie or Middleton for good diner."}
{"text":"We love coming to Spring Garden on weekend mornings! The service and breakfast food never disappoints. It is always packed, but we receive our food fast and it is always delic"}
{"text":"I was very happy to find this decent local breakfast place. Does a good business on the weekends, but we've never a wait to be seated. Friendly service. Nothing fancy or trendy but made better by the absolute lack of other options in Waunakee. That said,my eggs are always perfectly done and my daughter makes happy sounds when she eats their biscuits. The only disappointment was the hashbrowns which are pretty dry and tasteless.  Easy to miss it tucked in a strip mall by the hardware store, but a safe bet for a good breakfast if you are in the area."}
{"text":"To qualify my review: this place gets 5 stars on account of it being in Waunakee where there's not much to eat.  It's basically just a good small town family diner.  Cheap prices, friendly service, and big heaping servings of comfort food.  

My favorite sandwich is the Club Classic, a triple-decker turkey club made with real roast turkey, not cold cuts.  Awesome.  Order a sandwich \"deluxe\" and it comes with a cup of soup (just get the chicken soup) and your choice of side (choices include friggin spaghetti with meat sauce!).  Otherwise they have great breakfast food all day, and big huge awesome looking cakes and pies.  

Extra points for the bluehairs that seem to be in there every time I go there."}
{"text":"Friendly place. Food was pretty good. Served hot . They have the best shakes ever! The interior needs updating but its alright of a place with a lot of different selections on the menu"}
{"text":"Have gotten take-out from the place a few times with generally positive results.

As another reviewer commented - the place smells kinda mildewy when you walk in.  They really need to fix that as it makes a bad first impression.  One of those smells you'd get used to after sitting there for a while, but still think of after you've left."}
{"text":"It is really not great at all unless you go for breakfast. Which is great because it's really hard to screw up breakfast."}
