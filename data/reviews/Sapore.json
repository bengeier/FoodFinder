{"text":"Great food! A lot of different appetizers were given. This restaurant follows a typical 3 course \"Italian\" dinner with an antipasto, primo and secundo. An antipasto and secundo complement each other well if you want to eat meat. Great food!!"}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night during summer and the place was completely empy. Not a good sign. We ordered our food; mine was undercooked. Nothing special at all. We were all disappointed. Prices are very high; yet they still charge for bottled water. Never again."}
{"text":"LA VERA CUCCINA ITALIANA!

Don't search for the best Risotto in town anymore, Sapore has it! And the Granita? To live for!!!

The service is to perfection and the waiters are efficient yet human and kind.

They will se me again!  Top quality of what we use to see downtown (and even better)...but with parking! :)

Price? Little pricey for every day dining but not pricey for the quality and a nice evening with friend or between lovers (very nice decor)!

LA VERA CUCCINA ITALIANA!

Vous cherches pour le meilleur Risotto en ville? Sapore l'a! Ne cherchez plus! Et le Granita? Sublime!

Le service est  à la perfection avec des serveurs efficaces mais humains.

Ils vont m'y revoir. Qualité top qu'on ne retrouvait souvent qu'au centre-ville (et je dirais même mieux)...et avec stationnement gratuit! :)

Cher? Une peu cher pour le repas de tous les jours mais vraiment pas cher pour la qualité et une belle soirée entre amis ou en amoureux (décor superbe) !"}
{"text":"Sapore is an amazing find. I had the best meal I've had in ages there last night. The food is exquisite, fresh, and delicious. The service is warm, friendly and incredibly professional. The decor is beautiful: upscale yet not pretentious. Great music, and not played too loud. I would wholeheartedly recommend Sapore to anyone for a romantic tete-a-tete or private party. Although we live on the other side of town, we will definitely be back! A must visit."}
