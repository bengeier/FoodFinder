{"text":"I'd give this place 0 stars if it would let me. The staff is rude, and they don't allow kids under 6. My children (4 and 3 months) are very well behaved in restaurants, but they didn't even give them a chance. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"No kids 6 and under ... used to be a really friendly place , the grandview saloon, that was great to take out of town friends. Now too yuppie for young families. Have a heart! Our kids are well behaved in restaurants."}
{"text":"Beautiful view of range city & river and tasty food! I had the jumbo scallops and roasted red potatoes and they were both delicious! My meal did come out too soon after I got my salad though. A nice treat after arriving at the too of the Duquesne Incline!"}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I've ever had at a restaurant and amazingly rude wait staff.  The pasta carbonara was literally a bowl of cheese sauce with a few noodles floating in it.  The Caesar salad was visibly salted.  A woman with track marks on her arms muttered something unitelligable and then grabbed the check away from my confused friends hand.  View was.good though."}
{"text":"I think the view makes the food better. 

It is a great go to for out of town guest that want to grab a drink and experience the views that brought them to the Mount. 

The bar had 3 nice TVs for the March Madness games and Penguins. 

I will be back to this staple."}
{"text":"Made the trip from Chicago with our son to go to this place. Wouldn't let us in (even though it was empty), because our son is under the age of six. Never going to return to this place."}
{"text":"We were in town and went up the Duquesne incline so that my hubby (who had never been to Pittsburgh before) and family could see a great view of the city before we left. 

We opted to eat here since the menu seemed to cater to everyone in our group. The prices were inflated but that was expected because of the locale. We expressed to the wait staff that we'd like to wait for a table out on the patio and they were able to seat us within minutes. The staff and service was pretty good when we were in, so I'm surprised about all the bad service comments. 

Everyone enjoyed their dinner, but I do have to note that only one of us ordered steak. The rest of our orders included a burger, fish and pasta. I ordered a seafood pasta dish and was satisfied - yummy, but nothing to write home about, but I will say I was impressed that the size of the shrimp and scallops were big!  

All in all it was a lovely evening. Decent food and incredible view with great company!"}
{"text":"We had a great lunch here. Me, my husband, our moms and his sister went and had a great time. The view is awesome, that doesn't even need to said. Our waiter was super nice and opened up the balcony for us (it was closed as its winter)so we could snap a few pictures out there(we were celebrating quite a big event).  I was pleasantly surprised by the food. I thought it was really good. I read reviews that had said you go here for the view, not so much the food but I thought everything was terrific."}
{"text":"Terrible service I ordered my steak rare it came out medium well my wife ordered her steak medium it came out rare they sat us next to the window then asked us to move right before our meal since they sat us at the wrong table our waiter disappeared when it was time for the check blah blah blah don't go here this place is the worst we shouldn't have left a tip what a waste of money worst steak ever I created a yelp account just so I could post this review that's how much I hated it"}

Nice view
Nice bar

Steaks were over cooked
Tasted like choice not prime
Better to go to hosses 
Not the place to go for steak
Delmonico was 1/2 inch thick
They did take money of the bill 
Should have read the review before going"}
{"text":"Service: Horrible. Waited 1/2 hr for menus, another 1/2 for order, another half for bad bread, order lost at the one-hour mark, beer served warm....There nearly three hours just for drinks and entrees.

Food: Adequate salads. The over-priced steak was over-tenerized and tasteless. Stuffed shrimp had generous amount of good crab dressing, but over-cooked and dry.

Customer care: After all this, the waiter, who did offer an apology when the food order was lostand seemed overwhelmed, offered no comp anything...drinks, app, desert, discount,  nothing.

Also not ADA-compliant in the least. No chairs to sit in while waiting to go in, bar down a flight, dining up a flight, bathrooms up another flight.

If there was a hey-day for this place, it's over."}
{"text":"Fun fact, they don't allow children under six even if they are in a car seat. We went to sit down and they wouldn't let us sit. Disappointed because we drove here and were looking forward to the view."}
{"text":"Well I'll start with the good - the view was pretty. But I'm not sure how this place gets business surrounded by equally pretty views but substantially better choices. The inside decor was pretty crappy. Almost like they didn't try. The food was overpriced for what you go. Crab cakes had potential but the chef over seasoned them. The steaks were OK. The pasta tasted like salt and bacon. Eat n park has better salads.. the nacho app legit had gas station nacho cheese on it... I just couldn't believe it. Don't eat here. It's not worth it."}
{"text":"Don't ever try their Strips! and the service is worse than the food.

The half of the tiny piece of the steak was fat and overcooked.
we got a fish and a New York Strip but this strip was just horrible.
They tend to have overcook your steak generally so when we asked for a medium rare, it wasn't a surprise to see a well done steak.
But the portion didn't even seem like it was 12 oz (much smaller) and the fat was just grossly too much.
So we told our waiter that we were very disappointing and we dont want this dish anymore but he just kept making excuses that it is because of the way its cut and that much of fat is normal so he can't refund nor make a new steak since we already had some.
He ended up taking 10 dollars off for 2 beers but that was it. Not even for my drinks, just my boyfriend's since the strip was his food. No apologies, no attempt to make up for it, nothing.
Their filet mignon and tuna steak are what we usually get but it was just a terrible mistake to try something new; ended up seeing their worst customer service.
Never will I ever go back here nor take anyone especially when there are so many restaurants with higher quality of food and much better service for the same price (or less)."}
{"text":"This place was an incredible dump.  I was amazed when we walked in and found flies all over the place and yet they were charging $40 for steaks. It is a potential goldmine given its location but I wouldn't even stop in for the view. We literally left without ordering food we were so disturbed.

I will say the view is amazing but would avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"I joined yelp just to post a review- the entire experience was that bad. After making a reservation for a window table weeks in advance, they called the night before our party to ask if we could come at 5pm in order to sit with a view. When we said no, they said they couldn't honor our reservation because we hadn't put down a deposit. They never asked for a deposit and who does that for a restaurant reservation?
While the views are spectacular the food was bad and over priced. Save yourself some money and indigestion and bring a sandwich for a ride up the incline next door."}
{"text":"This is by far the best outdoor view of the City and the reason to go for drinks. That said, its rundown and very dated.  I would not eat here, as reviews weren't that good and it's pricey. But, grab some beers inside at the bar and bring them out of the deck and enjoy the view."}
{"text":"Don't Waste your time eating at this dump of a restaurant. Prices are ludachrist and food is mediocre. The only reason, and I mean the single only reason, anyone would ever eat here is for The View. And the view is better 50 ft down the street next to the incline."}
{"text":"The view is definitely very nice.  The food, however is nothing to brag about.  I had a peppered fillet that was somewhat decent with exception of being cooked medium instead of medium-rare like I asked.  

The decor brings a on wave of 80's nostalgia. The dining room lights are off in the evening, I suppose so that the view of the food does not distract you from the view of the city."}
{"text":"Never again.  

Learn that mantra and repeat it as necessary.  Never again... never again.

There's no one thing in particular wrong with this establishment.  But there's very little right, either.  The food is okay - at best.  The service is congenial.  The view is great.  But you leave with an overwhelming sensation of having your wallet taken for a ride.  

It took an hour from the time we sat down until our entrees appeared.  And this was at lunchtime on a Saturday.  The place was hardly slammed.  When it arrived, my \"Killer Crab\" sandwich was fair, but hardly anything I'd go running back for.  The few lonely french fries on the plate didn't do much to help.  

The name of the place, too, is highly deceiving.  You think \"steakhouse\" with elegant, dark wood decor.  You actually get a space that hasn't seen much in upgrades in decades.  

The cocktails, too, were as watery as the thing they call \"iced tea,\" which bore more of a resemblance to brown-tinted water than anything I've ever tasted that involved real tea leaves.  

The quality of Mount Washington dining has been going up in the past few years.  This place certainly bucks that trend, serving low-rent food at top-dollar prices."}
{"text":"My experience started when I called for reservations for my wife's birthday. I called and I asked for reservations in the afternoon a few days before going. They took my name and number and said they'd have to check and call me back in an hour. I thought that was strange. After three hours, no call back. My wife meanwhile called and made reservations because that's what she wanted to do on her birthday. I called again and they said no problem. I asked about a window seat. Had to put $25 down to guarantee a window seat at our scheduled time of 6:30 PM. The fee gets refunded off your bill. It is to guarantee you come so I could understand I guess, views are limited.

We arrived and were promptly seated. The waiter was attentive and polite. I thought \"hmmm, good, maybe the bad reviews were full of it after all\" after reading reviews and checking here on Yelp and Google. We each received a soda beverage since we don't drink (I was driving, she doesn't drink). The soda was good, not watered down or funny tasting like some carbonated taps are. We both ordered Delmonico Steaks and salads as side orders. The salads came and were fine. Then our meals come pretty quickly. Great service! I thought. Then the bottom of the bucket fell out.

Her steak was done right, ordered medium well. Mine was ordered medium rare and was well. I can't eat a steak at a \"steakhouse\" that costs almost $40 as well done. I complained and they promptly re-fired me another. That one came out in a few minutes and was blue all through - rare. Sent back for a few minutes. Came back and although better was still more rare then medium rare but whatever, I'd rather it be more rare then cooked. The steak by now was pretty much ruined with vital juice gone and being a little tough. This was a $39 steak. unacceptable. I also ordered \"red skinned roasted potatoes\". I ended up with what I call \"Idaho fried burnt potatoes\" which were chopped up idaho potato that was fried or roasted to a crisp.

My main focus is on the steaks we ordered. Besides the atmosphere and decor not being very pleasant nor romantic - cafeteria style tables and chairs, crowded, not very pleasant - the steaks were plain bad. How dare they call themselves a \"steakhouse\". It is known and signed as Grandview Saloon and Coal Steakhouse. They couldn't cook a steak to save their life. The steak was half fat (I know Delmonicos have marbling but not this bad) and not charred. A \"real\" steakhouse normally puts a nice char on the outside. They did slap some kind of glaze sauce and garlic butter on it, which wasn't bad. Half the steak came home for the dog. 

So in summary, we treated this place as a steakhouse in which it is billed as. This could be farther from the truth. My steak wasn't cooked right twice. The decor is something out of a cafeteria. The view was stunning. Maybe if we kept \"cheap\" and ordered a sandwich instead it would have been better. This was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner with a romantic view of the city and turned out to be a dud. It was a $125 view. I left there still hungry. Although I would try a sandwich or something else instead I would not go back. Too many other good choices. As for the steak dinner, I'd go to Texas Roadhouse or Lone Star for a much better experience. The steaks are actually tastier there. One last thing, our waiter didn't even to offer a comp for the lousy steak. My bad for not pushing it. I just wanted to get the hell out of there and not ruin my wife's birthday any further.

Two stars for the view , salads were edible and soda was good. The waiter was attentive and polite. Other than that, save your money. As another reviewer stated called it: \"A tourist trap\". Shame on us."}
{"text":"Spent the weekend hitting some cool spots, and this one probably has the best view of the city. It's located on top of Mount Washington and I don't think there is a bad view in this place. We took the incline up and it's a few steps from the top. Cold beer, some good tunes and a great view of the city."}
{"text":"If I could give a place zero stars, I WOULD!! After going up to Mount Washington on the Incline we were interested in relaxing with a cocktail and some appetizers on a patio with a view. It was 4:15 on a Wednesday and there were four adults and my daughter with us.

After discussing where we wanted to sit the host asked the age of my daughter and since she is 4 we were not permitted to eat there! They have a policy that only children six and older are permitted to eat there!!! Who has ever heard of such a rule and I can guarantee my four year old behaves as well at a restaurant as a six year old or more.

They lost out on a big sale, big tip and a future customer. I can guarantee I will NEVER be back. After seeing how few stars they have I think we were spared!!!"}
{"text":"Here's some free consulting for this sorry excuse for a restaurant-

-make sure your servers don't appear as if they rolled around in a dumpster in their work clothes before the shift.

-don't assign an entire room of 10+ tables to a server who probably couldn't handle 3.

-don't serve 4 dirty appetizer plates to a table that needs 6 clean ones.

Laughable. Complete rip off."}
{"text":"This was the first place my fiance and I went when we moved to Mt Washington.  Bit of a let down.  I had an eggplant parm sandwich.  It was fine, very big, but just fine.  My finance had a steak.  Not impressed!  The place is called Coal Hill STEAKhouse.  Learn how to pick a good piece of steak and cook it properly!  It was really overpriced as well!  Has a nice view, but not worth it if I can't get a nice meal to go with it!"}
{"text":"Owney's Bottomline: At the top of the Duquesne Incline and provides some great food with a great view. 

We initially sat outside for the great view, it was too cold, so the waiter was nice enough to help us move inside. 

What we ordered:
  
     Mezza plate - Awesome! Lots of variety, huge portions and extremely tasty. It filled me up and I felt like I made a healthy choice compared to what I was going to get. 

     Crab sandwich - also fantastic with great portions. 

With beer and a French onion soup...$65 + tip"}
{"text":"Very good food. Had a great time here and ordered the gnocchi with prime rib it was fantastic! Set up a propsal with the wife here a few months back and they helped me the whole way, made a good day of it. Dessert was again delicious caramel cheesecake. I then got some wings which were very tasty. She ordered some pasta and was by no means disappointed. Obviously took the incline up for some nostalgic fun. Figured it worked great right before the Bill Burr show. Cannot wait to come back! Very good people good food nice view. I thought it was lit ok decorated to the liking with modern brushed stainless accents."}
{"text":"View is amazing, food is mediocre, drink selection is decent, and service is okay. Nothing great, but honestly, on a summer afternoon, having a beer on the outdoor deck overlooking the city -- you'll forget all that."}
{"text":"One of the friendliest places I've ever been, all the waiters and waitresses engage in conservation with you, asking where you're from and what brought you to Pittsburgh and how are you enjoying the city, I definitely felt welcome. My friend said his cheeseburger was one of the best he ever had and I loved my chicken Cesar wrap as well as the homemade chips. The Oreo dessert was a little expensive but worth it. Our meals were fairly cheap; both of us spend less than $25. The views are awesome."}
{"text":"Great view ---- that's it ---- horrible steak, thin and greasy --- nachos were ok but bar food quality --- this place reminds me of a place on restaurant makeover (before)"}
{"text":"Appetizers & drinks were good, but pricey. Dinner was horrible and very expensive. I had the stuffed shrimp which was WAY over cooked & served barely warm. I sent it back to have it microwaved. My daughter had the seafood scampi - the pasta was a little too al dente & the seafood overdone. The salads were served warm... how do you serve a warm salad? At least out the dishes in the freezer. With so many other choices on Mt. Washington, I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great view, not good food. It was edible, but sort of like convention or meeting food might be. Not overly crowded on a Friday night which - with that view - probably answers all your questions. We were a party of five, with a mix of entrees, but none of them stood out - and not worth whatever the bill may have come to at the end of the night. We had great company, and that made it bearable. I can't actually no recommend this enough."}
{"text":"Despite the beautiful views the service was appalling and the food was beyond mediocre. The waitress said she couldn't take our order due to a backup in the kitchen and she came back almost half an hour later only after another table called her out on the fact that the waitress working the inside dining room was taking orders. We sat there for over an hour before getting any food and the waitress didn't even bring us water and was sassy when we asked for it. When the food finally arrived it was really lame like beyond average diner food. Truly a waste of money. We should have just taken pictures of the view atop the incline and skipped it.  It was truly the most unprofessional and rude service I've ever had even worse than at any fast food joint."}
{"text":"Eat in the bar and off the bar menu. Decent sandwiches, appetizers and burgers. Steak sandwich is very good. View is great, and the deck is an amazing place to have a drink or two on a nice day.
Do NOT, however, eat upstairs in the \"steakhouse.\" The ambience is that of your grandmothers kitchen in 1960, the service is abysmal, the food is at best mediocre, and it is WAY overpriced."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go back if it was free. Took a party of 18 here for a business dinner. Happy time right?  Open credit card. Eat ,drink what you want. Server was slow. Confused. Not very pleasant. Got first round of drinks. And took our food order, and vanished. After more then 30 minutes of waiting. (Expected due to such a big order) but no drink refills. A runner brought out three trays of our dinners, and left them in stands in kind of the main walk way. ( people passing by ) coming and going. Our dinner sat there. I would bet close to 10 minutes. At this point one of our crew got up and started passing out dinners. Our waitress finally showed up. Saying I'm sorry. I didn't know your food was out ,and finished passing dinners around. After she finished she walked away. With out refilling our drinks. Gone. Not coming back apparently. We had to grab another waitress to refill our drinks. . Desert?  Another adventure. Cheese cake was warm. Some didn't arrive at all. Had the wait on the check. By the end of it all. My party of 18 was out on the side walk. And I was waiting inside to settle the bill. To sum up my experience. They couldn't care less. Come back. Don't. Enjoy your meal. Don't. Whatever. We spent more then $2k. On this trip and could have spent much more. Never going back. Never ever."}
{"text":"If you have kids, don't go here.  My perfectly behaved 5 month old wasn't allowed to enter, as they don't accept patrons below the age of 6.  I guess this explains why there were absolutely no people eating inside.  Needless to say, based on the other reviews, my experience, and the lack diners, I have no intention of trying this restaurant--with or without my daughter."}
{"text":"Brought a friend here from out of town. She had never been to pittsburgh, so of course you gotta take them to Mt. Washington. Assumed this place would be good as every other place on the mount is....  Assumption wrong. Had 7:30 reservations and sat at bar til 8 waiting for our table.  Seating area felt like a cafeteria. Server was not understanding or nice about my friend's gluten allergy. Overpriced steak that wasn't cooked correctly and nothing I couldn't have made at home. Actually, my steak at home is way better. Not impressed and won't be back."}
{"text":"Tourist trap.  Like a cafeteria on Mt. Washington."}
{"text":"The view is amazing so be sure to get a seat on the patio. The staff was very accommodating when I asked to move from my indoor seat to an outdoor one. I had a quick caprese app and I loved it. Everything was fresh. Would definitely go there again, but mainly for the view."}
{"text":"Beautiful view of city. Although service was prompt, server was not too knowledgeable of menu.  Food was good but very salty."}
{"text":"Bad service, don't go here! They don't treat their customers equally, they choose who to give good service to."}
{"text":"Inflated drink prices due to high rent and the view of the Golden Triangle, sounds familiar, doesn't it? Welcome to the Coal Hill Steakhouse at Grandview Saloon. It's not just this joint, it's all the Grandview Avenue restaurants. The View masks the poor food quality, the over inflated drink prices, and mediocre service. Just look out at the view and you'll forget about the frozen chicken tenders, rubbery and over salted, the watery drinks are much better when you're watching fireworks near PNC Park after a Bucco home run and victory.

Do yourself a huge favor and give up the view, head on over to the Shiloh Inn, sit out on the deck (Weather Permitting) or grab a seat in this old house, refurbished into a quaint eatery and chow down on some excellent pub food and let the tourists have the view, besides we've all seen it before, right?"}
{"text":"This review is for the Grandview saloon only. View 5 stars, Service 2 stars, Toasted Marshmallow Dessert Cocktail negative stars.

The cocktail I ordered looked promising on paper although I was a little hesitant because it included banana liquor, but I gambled that the toasted marshmallow would prevail. It did not. The beverage started off promising with the toasted marshmallow, but quickly went south when the banana liquor kicked in. IT did not receive positive review from our table either. The drink proceeded to sit in front of me and mixed with melting ice started to look like a type of bodily fluid, which I won't name.

As for the view, you couldn't get a better one on Mount Washington overlooking the Pittsburgh skyline. With both an indoor bar and a terrace, we were able to move inside once the cold got the best of us."}
{"text":"This is a great, no a grand location on grandview ave.  The view is amazing and it has one of the best decks in Mt. Washington and plenty of outdoor seating.  It is a must visit in the summer when you can view the beautiful Pittsburgh vista in all its wonder.  I've been coming here for almost a decade and while I give the place much deserved kudos for a fantastic location and wonderful deck the food is another story.  I guess it's best to start with a little background the current incarnation is the \"coal hill steakhouse\" at the Grandview Saloon.  Most regulars still refer to the place as the Grandview for obvious reasons.  In all the years I've been a patron I don't think I've ever had dinner in one of the dining rooms.  The entrance has two sets of stairs, one leading downstairs to the bar and wonderful deck and the other two leading to two dining rooms upstairs.  The carpeting and general decor of the dining rooms is dated and the food used to be, well in a word... awful.  It's a little better now, but not close to what I would consider good food.  The owner is a surgeon who clearly uses this venue for tax purposes probably without a lot of consideration given necessarily to the quality of the product.  Again, the view is great from all areas of the restaurant and this place does most of its business in the summer when folks appreciate the outdoor seating more.  The food has improved lately in its most recent incarnation as a \"steakhouse\".  Let me back up,,, besides kudos for the view the staff is very corteous and friendly.  I had lunch here today and was the only visitor to the bar for the couple hours I was there and had a good conversation with Rose who was working a very tame sunday shift.  Charlie and Dana are also excellent bartenders.  The bar seats about 15 with plenty of hightops and again lots of outdoor deck seating for the summer.  It has three huge plasmas with plenty of sporting options.  They maintain a decent wine menu and have plenty of beer options, including guiness on tap.  Charlie and Dana also make a reasonably good dirty martini.  If you are looking for a place that is not crowded on a Sunday to watch football you could do a lot worse.  Okay, now to the food.  I've ate here multiple times and never really had a good meal.  The steak prices are unreasonable I believe for the quality of the product and it's not possible to get a steak less than 14 oz. and $40 plus dollars unless you orderr a filet.  They offer the filet in a 6 oz. and 10 oz. option.  I still think the $30 plus pricetag is a bit much for the 6 oz. filet.  I think they say it's prime, but in my experience the steaks don't stack up to those of mortons or ruths.  Today I ordered a cup of french onion soup, which was probably the highlight of the meal with a nice crouton, tasty broth, and plenty of melted guyerre (sp?) cheese.  I then ordered a cheesesteak sandwich and asparagus instead of fries.  The cheesesteak was a huge serving, but of relatively flavorless meat underseasoned on a stale non toasted bun.  The asparagus were tiny and had way too much salt.  If this place puts itself out as a prime steakhouse the asparagus should be much better and the steak should have some flavor.  They also charge an additional $3 for veggies instead of fries on top of the cost of the sandwich platter.  The view is 5 stars, service 4 stars and food 2 stars."}
