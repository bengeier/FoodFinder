{"text":"We stopped in on a Friday afternoon around 2:30pm while on our way to Montreal. There were a few people in the restaurant finishing up their lunches, and we thought we might be in for a dismal dining experience as we missed the lunch rush. Boy were we wrong! We were promptly greeted by our waiter who was cheerful and friendly, and he let us choose our table.

He gave us their limited menu that's served between lunch and dinner time, and kindly reviewed all the options with us. A few moments later he returned with the full lunch menus and informed us that we could order either menu if we wanted to! This was a really nice gesture as we were the only ones in the restaurant at this point and the kitchen would have to switch back to \"lunch mode\" to prepare an order from this menu. Our server reviewed the lunch menu with us as it was in French and we did not understand everything on it.

I ordered a flight of beers to start with and he promptly brought over the 3 lightest first, and later brought the three darker ones once he noticed I was almost done with the third. Now that's service! I got to enjoy each beer at the optimal temperature! After the meal, I asked to try Raftman, which is one that I have not seen in the US. He brought over a sample for not only me, but for my husband too.

For lunch, I ordered the vegetarian manicotti, although I cannot remember exactly what it was called on the menu! It was delicious. Fresh made pasta filled with a ricotta cheese and vegetable filling, covered in an herb-y creamy sauce with assorted colored carrots and cauliflower. I could have eaten that herb sauce by the spoonful, it was soooo good!
My husband ordered the grilled cheese with apples and caramelized onions, which was perfectly grilled to a deep golden brown, stuffed with lots of onions and apples. It was served with a small salad of greens, lightly dressed. He really enjoyed it!

Oh yes, and our meals came with a creamy root vegetable soup that was silky smooth and full of flavor! and a small piece of cheesecake for dessert!

After our meal, I mentioned that I wanted to purchase some of the Unibroue beers, so our server showed us to the little store and pointed out the limited edition beers and also the ones that we probably wouldn't fine in the US. Super helpful! I purchased three and cannot wait to enjoy them.

We had an incredible experience here on a freezing Friday afternoon! Amazing food, great beer, and five star service! I wish I asked for the gentleman's name who served us, he gave us a great experience! Out of our whole 3-day weekend experience in the Montreal area, this place was head and shoulders above the rest."}
{"text":"The \"FF\" is a place that I have been to 3 times and I have never been disappointed. I had the \"bavette de boeuf\" (hope I spelled it correctly) on their specialty menu which was featuring maple products. I was started off with a brilliant butternut squash soup with cream and sprinkled with a bit of maple sugar. 

The main course, as previously mentioned, was delicious. I was worried that they didn't ask me how I wanted it cooked and it didn't matter. The steak was seared nicely with a pink inside with a ruby red center. If you want your steak well done, buy ground beef and salt it, these guys know how to cook meat. 

My dessert was a \"cigare a l'erable\" which was a pastry \"cigar\" on top of a bed of cream and chocolate and filled with maple cream. I think very highly of this place not only because of my meal, but again, having been there 3 times and never having had a bad dish I can say this about the menu:

1) It focuses heavily on the \"produit du terroir\" or local products as they pertain to Quebec. The culinary inspirations are \"Nouveau France\" and indigenous as evidenced by their focus on squashes and wild game dishes.

2) Everything can be paired with the right beer, my favorites are \"Maudite\" (an amber red) and \"Fin du Monde\" (Golden Ale). Anyways, just because something is cooked with that alcohol does not always mean that it has to permeate the flavor, just complement the dish at the very least.

3) I'm not sure this is a \"gastropub\" since there isn't really a pub to just purely sit down and drink. This is a restaurant that deserves that distinction and the view sitting by the river and Fort Chambly give it a great environment to enjoy any meal."}
{"text":"J'ADORE!!!! 
La bière est mise en valeur!! Des produits de chez nous et de très bonne qualité. Ma viande est toujours parfaitement cuite et l'ambiance est super. La vue est également très belle."}
{"text":"Fourquet Fourchette is essentially the brew-pub for Unibroue, just down the street in Chambly, Quebec.  It is a quintessential gastro-pub.  Unibroue probably has the most solid complete line of beers available from a commercial brewer and here they're as fresh as they come and served along with some scrum-didili-umptious eats (if not 100% consistent  since they're open 7-days a week and a chef's gotta take a break sometime).

The building is an old something-or-other, and has been repurposed as a resaurant and event spot.  The entry doubles as the Unibroue gift shop and upstairs has a event room for all your middle-ages/castle themed weddings and such.  The back wall faces lake Chambly and is just one giant 3-story set of windows.  In nicer weather there's seating or event hosting on the back patio by the lake.  It's a damn nice spot.  It's the perfect place to discover all the Unibroue brews you didn't know about or just can't get elsewhere.

Get a Chambly Noire on tap and slip into heaven."}
{"text":"good for lunch with a good soup and salad bar.
excellent lunch deal.
good local food selection.
nice outdoor seating on the lake.
very friendly and helpful staff."}
{"text":"Ambiance Nouvelle-France soirée thématique vous aurez du plaisir.  Biere de microbrasserie"}
{"text":"When looking at this page on my web browser on my phone it said \"Yelpers report this location is closed,\" which is so wrong ... It most certainly is not. 

We stopped by the Unibroue brewery around the corner because my husband thought they had a hospitality center and tours. Not so much. Hopping on the phone, we found the Fourquet Fourchette was less than a half mile away, so we hopped back in the car. Found it open. Not closed. Whew!

The restaurant was completely empty (it being 2pm) but the back patio had a couple families and friends, a nearby bike path/trail seemed to lead straight here for a wonderful water-side rest.  

We also noted that a wedding was going to be taking place, so that was kind of cool. We got to clap and cheer for the bride and groom on their special day. 

We had the beset grilled cheese sandwiches ever, followed by a monstrous charcuterie platter. Our waitress didn't know the english words for some of the things on the tray, but we didn't care. We were gonna eat it anyway. So good. Could have used a couple more slices of toasted bread, but overall... amazing. More than perfect for two of us. 

We enjoyed Maudite, Ephemere, Blonde de Chambly, Raftman (in bottle because it wan't available on tap) and la fin du monde. 

We watched the wedding party enjoy Blonde de Orange which is kind of a mimosa with beer. I took a picture of one that was returned to the bar and wished that the bartender had given it to me instead of pouring it away... ah me. Heartbreaking. 

Gift store was a little expensive but we were there and bought some beer to take home and 2 beautiful glasses. 

Overall, absolutely no complaints. Hearts and bellies full... the manager then asked if we liked beer history and recommended we swing by Bedondaine & Bedons Ronds. Which we greatly enjoyed. 

Beautiful setting, beautiful day, beautiful everything."}
{"text":"We came here with another couple on a Friday night for dinner.  We were quickly seated on the outside patio, overlooking the Chambly River.  The sun was just starting to set, creating a wonderful ambiance.

We started with the beer sampler - a flight of 6 - 3oz Unibroue beers.  Definitely the way to go, if you are not familiar with their beers.  Our server was extremely helpful and friendly, and provided us with English menu, which really just made us more hungry reading the descriptions.  The appetizers that stand out were the Warm Salad (with scallops seared to perfection, smoked salmon), the seared foie gras (no description needed - AMAZING), the \"pow wow\" (a sampler platter of smoked meats, etc).

For entrees, I had the Guinea Fowl with Chanterelle Mushroom, local seasonal vegetables, and potatoes... wait... and topped with some seared foie gras.  A perfect balance of flavors, and the guinea fowl was moist and flavorful - would definitely order again.  There was also a venison steak dish, which a friend had - I didn't try it myself, but there were rave reviews.  Crispy skin salmon with seasonal vegetables and rice - very fresh and tasty.

Unfortunately, we didn't have room for dessert.  I would definitely come here again!  (posted some pics of the evening)."}
{"text":"Went there for a wedding ceremony and reception, service was great, the staff was courteous and the food was really good, I had deer steak for dinner and it tasted heavenly..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the Chambly area.  The service is always good, but it's not a quick in and out. 

They have awesome entrees, the chicken dish and the duck dish are top notch. The best duck I've had in North America. 

Nice place, nice view, great food. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We came here when we realized, after driving all the way to Chambly, that Unibroe did not offer tastings or tours.  Our research showed that Fourquet Fourchette is like the unofficial Unibroe  tasting room and I love waterfront dining so we were excited.

The interior is reminiscent of an old tavern and they have prints of all of the Unibroe beer labels framed and hung in the walls.  The lake side wall is all windows and let in a lot of light.  It was a very warm, relaxing setting for lunch.

We ordered Unibroe beer flights, French onion soup, and a big meat, cheese, and veggie platter.  As soon as our food and drink came out, so did the flies... Tens of fruit flies buzzing around our meal the entire time we were there.  I'm not sure if it was from unclean beer taps or food sitting out too long but it was totally disgusting and a major turn off for us.  And there was not really anything we could do about it short of walking it so we tried to finish quickly so we could get out of there.  The soup was good, the platter I would not recommend, warm and soggy. 

Based on our overall experience I cannot recommend this place - if you are set on a Unibroe tasting you are better off buying an assortment of their beers, which are available everywhere in and around Montreal, and doing your own tasting!"}
{"text":"Nice decore in this large restaurant - the theme is beer. Appropriately, there is good beer selection on tap, as well as wine, and excellent food. Superb service. Recommended!"}
{"text":"My friend was visiting me from NYS and we are both huge Unibroue beer fans, so a trip to Chambly before heading to Montreal was in order. 

We found out upon arrival that Unibroue does not have a tasting room open to the public on site (I should have read the Yelp reviews first-ROOKIE MISTAKE), but they kindly recommended we head over to this lovely establishment that does their tastings and even cooks with their beers!

When we arrived, we were greeted but the beautiful illustrations of the different Quebecois folklore legends that are depicted on the beer labels. It was like we have arrived in Unibroue Heaven. 

The restaurant overlooks the gardens and the bay. Deep mahogany colored wood and a large bar area as well as a full seating area below and above, make this a really attractive multi-purpose eating establishment. 

Their menu includes a luncheon prix fixe option, which offered a delightful array of dishes for $14-18CA including an all-you-can-eat salad and soup bar, fresh bread and rolls, main dish, and dessert with coffee. Um, oui, s'il vous plaît!

I chose the Onglet de buf, sauce aux poivres et Trois-Pistoles, which was a tender piece beef in a peppercorn and Trois-Pistoles infused beer sauce. Delicious. My friend ordered the Poulet au sauce sage, a tender and moist chicken dish with a sage gravy. Equally tasty. Each dish came with potatoes and veggies. The veggies were the typical steamed kind, so nothing to write about. 

I also chose to do the Unibroue beer sampler which allowed me to try the beers I had yet to try. I ended up sharing some of the generous pours with my dining companion, as the alcohol content is pretty high on my favorites and I didn't want to nap the day away in a blissful, drunken slumber. 

I will definitely be returning here and bringing loads of beer lovers with me."}
{"text":"Being huge fans of Unibroue (and the fact that they don't give tours at the brewery), it was essential for us to check out Fourquet Fourchette... and that we have... TWICE!  A great place for beer geeks!  They have their entire line-up of current beers to choose from and an excellent little store that you can purchase bombers and interesting things like Trois Pistoles Mustard, Blance De Chambly Orange Marmalade, and Trois Pistoles Blackberry Jam (we purchased all three of these and they are all delicious)!

We hit the restaurant at a weird time (around 4pm) on this trip and they had a limited menu.  We did a meat and cheese plate to go along with a Sampler (3 ounces of Blanche De Chambly, Ephemere [Seasonal], Blonde De Chambly, Noire De Chambly, La Fin Du Monde, and Trois Pistoles) and Seigneuriale for me and an Ephemere Cerise (Cherry) for my wife.  A minor setback was that four of the six beers in my sampler came out of the bottle instead of the tap, so only two of them had that super-fresh taste, but it was still good nonetheless.  I would recommend finding out what is on draft and sticking with those, though, because those beers will rank among the best beers you will ever have in your life.

Restaurant atmosphere was beautiful.  When we went during the summer, it felt like a lovely cottage house on the lake.  When it was cold in October, it felt like a rustic ski lodge just getting ready for the snow.  Service was very courteous.  We practiced our French this time (as there were some language barriers on the first visit) but both of our servers spoke excellent English.

Definitely recommended to swing through on your way up to Montreal.  Even if you're heading to Quebec City, it's not difficult to get to, just a long trip after you leave.  If you're heading back to the US, just remember that you'll be dealing with the border about a half-hour after leaving and that might not work out too well.  Please note that we were able to purchase Unibroue shirts on our first trip through but we heard a rumor that no more clothes were being produced.  I hope they change their mind on that one!  Also, be sure to check their hours before making the drive as they have limited hours during Chambly's slower months."}
{"text":"Absolutely my new favorite spot on the way to Montreal! We stopped by over the summer after reading about it and the place was one of the busiest restaurants I've ever seen so we unfortunately didn't have reservations. Luckily, we went back this weekend on a pretty slow day and finally got to experience the location. We mostly went in for a flight but also had a delicious cheese plate, and it was great. We were so lucky Richard, the manager, was there and he even gave us a tour and history of the restaurant, and was so wonderful and friendly. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone, make a reservation in advance and enjoy a great place with a gorgeous view!"}
