{"text":"Tremendous breakfast bagel sandwich served promptly and with friendly service. Coffee was good, too. Place is worth a stop, especially if you are on the run."}
{"text":"If you're currently going to the great Canadian Bagel in first canadian place, do yourself a favor and go here instead. One of my pet peeves is having to repeat my order over and over again, these ladies ask what you want and always follow through accurately. They are super friendly and always remember you.   The bagels are delicious. The cream cheese is actually creamy and not watered down.I usually have the egg and cheese, and it's superb. The egg and cheese costs me $3.14......downtown Toronto, you will never see that. Compare this to the great Canadian Bagel which costs $4.50 for just a Bagel and cream cheese.   I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I always come here when I'm craving a bagel. The cute Korean ladies that run the place are always hustling and are super sweet while doing so. They are always happy to see you and I've never had to wait long or had a messed up order.   The bagels are great... they got 2 sizes depending on your appetite and a pretty big selection for such a small shop. Prices are fair. I normally go in time for breakfast special deals.   Nothing negative to say except the can improve on their coffee."}
{"text":"Very quick service.   There are 5 women working in this small place. But they r pretty quick considerig that i ordered a hot sandwich with egg. It was made to my choice and served hot. Bagel was good but not one of not the best I've had. They r essentially a deli with soups and meats to go in other breads as well. They have 4 kinds of brewed coffee in jugs.  i had the irish creme. it was good. Overall very good."}
{"text":"This place is located in the Richmond Adelaide Food court, just before you enter the Sheraton Hotel zone when walking from south to north.    Five stars is given for 3 reasons:  A) owner pride and passion.   This is run by a Korean family and their friends, and they wake up at 3AM every morning to buy fresh bagels, bread, and fruit etc.  B) Their chicken salad on a bagel.   Say yes to the dijon mustard and get it toasted.  One of the best deals under $5 in the city.  C) They have a huge selection of bread, bagels, yogurt and menu items to choose from.  The staff is rocket fast and quite happy to serve you.   One downfall is that they are cash only.  Usually I would take a star off for that, but this place's value for money is just too high."}
{"text":"This food court offering is an absolute gem in the Financial District, and it's in the PATH, so you have the choice to walk here underground! Located in the Richmond-Adelaide Centre food court (just across from the David's Tea, Nadege, MNP and Google Office entrance, around the corner from M Square Coffee, on the way up to the Eaton Centre through the PATH, etc), this place is a great spot to purchase reasonably priced breakfast fare and lunch options.   I've visited several times, and all my orders so far have been fresh, quick, and a good portion size. There are a variety of bagel types/flavours, you'll have lots to select from, and they have more than just breakfast fare - they have many sandwich options too. If you order anything with meat, they are very generous with how much they stuff your sandwich/bagel, and the same goes for their cream cheese.   On a recent visit, I ordered a chicken sandwich on their version of an \"everything\" bagel, and the portion size was large, sauces were tasty, all the ingredients were so fresh, and it was, honestly, a very well-made, delicious sandwich - and under $5.00!   For the area, the prices are very reasonable. There is also plenty of clean food court seating, which is wiped down/swept regularly. I will definitely be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Another gem in downtown!! Well not really, I see a lot of people lining up at this place every morning, I just never actually tried but I'm GLAD i did earlier this week.  I tried their smoked salmon bagel and lox (smoked salmon) cream cheese bagel and both were so good!  They give you so much cream cheese for the price you pay!  Plus their bagels are top notch, very flavorful and it's not hard to chew even after toasting!!  Depending on what you get, the most expensive is probably the smoke salmon bagel which comes to around $6.50, but I thought the price justifies the quality and quantity they give you!  They also have a large selection of bagels which fits all bagel lovers!  If only they have blueberry bagel too.  I think i just found myself a new breakfast place at work but need to look out for the calories count."}
{"text":"Do you see over there--on the right--where it says in tiny print \"Cards Accepted: None\"? This is a cash only business, which means that for those of us traveling on business, who want to expense meals on the company card, this place is a non-starter. I WISH I had had a chance to experience their bagels, but as an American with no Canadian coin on me, I couldn't even try their food out. Maybe they prefer to cater to Canucks only? Oh well."}
{"text":"Butter in my BLT!!! I've had it with them.  Stop putting butter in the bagels unless people ask for it!!!  Do you think people enjoy the extra cholesterol and calories without even asking?  I'm done with this place for good!  I asked for a BLT with mayo and she puts butter!  Also the lady working the cash sometimes handles the bagels and never washes after touching the cash.  Never again!"}
{"text":"Their bagels taste superb and yet, the prices are incredibly cheap compared to the quality, 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"On paydays, I like to treat myself to a good BLT sandwich and I always come here.   Their prices are reasonable: their BLTs on toast costs only $2.99, tax included. The bacon to lettuce and tomato ratio is fair, too. You always feel ripped off when you bite into a sandwich and there isn't bacon in every chew.   The staff also reminds me of a synchronized swimming team: five, sometimes six ladies, flow cohesively together from one corner of the tiny open kitchen to another, without spilling food or bumping into each other. They should apply for the Olympics because they win gold every time we, the customers, get our orders in under two minutes.   Plus, here, you're always greeted with a smile and nothing beats that when it comes to starting your day on the right foot."}
{"text":"Bagel & Co is located in the path on the right side of Sheraton, across from the mortgage store in the Tims food court. Easily missed if you are walking towards the Tims.  I ordered the New Yorker which has smoked salmon, onions, and cream cheese. They have a huge variety of bagels to choose from for the small size - which is your typical bagel size. But you can also go for the large bagels which only have a few flavour selections.   Food is prepared in front of you, takes about 2-3 minutes. I went a bit after 9 and there wasn't a line up. Smoked salmon tasted fresh (and still a bit cold, yay!) Could definitely use a tad bit more cream cheese, and they definitely did not go easy on the onions.  I guess it's a slighly healthier option than your typical Tims or McD breakfast!  CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Bagels might be good but customer service really stinks. I felt more yelled at then served. The menu and ordering system is confusing. They are also cash only which takes them down a notch in this day and age.   As a former east coaster, the bagel was good but not NY sublime which the other five star reviews seem to suggest. Four stars for the bagel, minus one for the lack of customer service, confusing menu, and lack of payment options."}
{"text":"Great deal on a fresh bagel breakfast sandwich. Spinach, tomato, cream cheese, egg, all good. Reasonable coffee. Fair price for all. Will be back the next time I'm looking for breakfast at 630am"}
{"text":"A hidden gem! I had no idea this spot existed but thank goodness I discovered it because boy do they have some delicious bagels.   My boyfriend grabbed two bagels to go: vegetarian and smoked salmon. Their multigrain whole wheat bagel is next level, so crunchy and delicious. Their cream cheese that they used in the smoked salmon was also on point not to mention they do not cheap out on amount of salmon given!   The bagels cost ~$3.50 each, a great price for healthy bagels. Will definitely come back if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh bagels with a wide variety of types.  Staff is efficient and quick...just don't expect a huge conversation.  Simply place your order, make payment, step aside, and wait for your yummy order to be handed to you. This place is cash only, so ensure you're carrying cash or you'll end up needing to take a short walk to the CIBC to get some. Location-wise, if you're not familiar with \"The Path\" it can be a bit confusing to get to at first.  They are located in the Richmond-Adelaide food court.  Most people downstairs can help direct you, don't be afraid to ask. I've wandered hours back and forth in the Path in an attempt to locate this place, their bagels are that good, especially when there are countless food places that would easily stop most people who aren't as determined to find it as I was."}
