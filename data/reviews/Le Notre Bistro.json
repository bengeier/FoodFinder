{"text":"Phenomenal. Cozy and quiet bistro with seasonal, local foods. The owner explained every dish and every wine very well when asked. I had the duck confit and my boyfriend had le burger. Everything was delicious and perfectly cooked. Cannot recommend this new addition to Toronto highly enough!"}
{"text":"Just got home from a totally delicious dinner at Le Notre Bistro! Small cozy restaurant with a very tasty menu, beautiful presentation and good wines to choose from.  I indulged in the arugula salad, a daily soup made of sunchoke, parmesan, onion and a touch of cream, and the boullabaisse.  While the entire meal was delicious, the boullabaisse was simply superb.  All of the seafoods were respectively cooked to perfection - the whole of the dish was spectacular.  I highly recommend asking for extra baguette (which is also divine) to soak up the saffron infused fish broth.  Additionally! My daughter who I dined with follows a vegan diet, which can make ordering restaurant food often tricky.  Nonetheless the chef cooked an array of wonderful vegetable dishes, off the menu, that looked absolutely incredible.    It was a wonderful experience, I will recommend this restaurant to any and all of my acquaintances!"}
{"text":"Totally over top food ambience and device! Extremely good value and owner is truly a great host Menu very varied but try scramble eggs! Enjoy and sit at bar need chef kitchen! DRH"}
{"text":"The signature duck confit pasta was extremely salty to the point of being almost inedible. However, the service was good and the waiter helped us choose a great bottle of wine."}
{"text":"We had a great meal for Valentine's Day.  The tasting menu was excellent (especially the razor clams) and the wine selections were interesting and good value.  Because the restaurant has just opened and it was jam packed for the night, the service was a bit slow although earnest and attentive.  I look forward to going back and trying some of their other offerings as the menu evolves.  It is a great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Le Notre is a perfect French spot for date night!  A quieter, intimate spot off Harbord, my wife and I made our second visit and had time to tuck into the Chef's Menu. After a brief conversation, you get a sampling of items catered to your interests, each dish was outstanding. I'd strongly recommend the wine pairings as well, they're well thought-out and elevate each dish.  Serguei, the ma√Ætre d' is also a star. Attentive, knowledgeable and professional, I'd gladly put any dining experience in his hands. Where many similar restaurants in town veer stuffy and slightly condescending, he keeps things at a tight, comfortable level.  Looking forward to returning already."}
{"text":"These guys. Dedicated to delivering a food experience with great ingredients. They deliver. The 4 course sampler allows these guys to dazzle you with a creative set of dishes.   Service was excellent, food was outstanding. The restaurant is a little bistro that creates a wonderful ambience in a great neighborhood.   I loved my experience here and will be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is tucked away on the corner of Harbord and Manning Ave. Where Ici Bistro used to be. It is small and reservations are definitely recommended. About a third of the seating is bar stool type so be specific if you want a  table.  The wine list has a reasonable selection, with a preponderance of Italians in the red list. We had a good Sancerre, $75 and an excellent Rhone, $110.  We thoroughly enjoyed the food, and they were very open to and facilitated the fact that we shared everything.  Some olives stuffed with anchovies and a decent little salami appeared without asking soon after we sat down. The Tartine, not something we would normally order, was outstanding. Hot mushrooms and cheese on essentially toast. Crisp! We had ordered Sea Bream, but they ran out and offered Groupa instead which did not appeal; so we had the Octopus which was the smaller ends of the tentacles and a fine mild flavour but compared to the rest of the meal this was not the highlight. They are still worth trying. The Duck Pappardelle were full of duck, rich, very tasty with fine pasta. The quail were very garlicky, warm and moist and the french fries were good, hot and herby, recommendable.  The owner was present , attentive and very solicitous. He reminded me slightly of Basil.  Overall this is a good find."}
{"text":"Must Try, This restaurant has become my favourite in TO. The tasting menu is amazing the service is super friendly, not just the server but even the kitchen staff is super friendly, they accommodate the tasting menu to any allergy, which luckily I don't have but I do hate mustard... the made just such an amazing tasting menu.   The have a fair wine list, that matches what our eating, they don't pressure to buy the expensive one they suggest the one that goes to your tastes, and the suggestion they gave me was one of the lowest price (only one dollar over cheapest)  I'm definitely coming back for a different tasting menu, to see what the chef has to offer."}
{"text":"It is more than evident when a restaurant owner has aimed for above and beyond a \"great\" experience. Serguei has the ability to make you feel both welcome and valued. We came on a rainy Wednesday evening for an early dinner. Upon entering, we were greeted warmly and shown to our table - our coats were taken to be hung out back.  Serguei first came to fill our waters and answered questions regarding the drinks menu - he sincerely takes the time to understand your likes and dislikes, and recommended spectacular choices. He also went through the menu with us - nothing ever felt pushy, rushed, or forced - rather, Serguei has the great ability to make you feel as if you're immersed in a wonderful conversation regarding the food they offer and still retains the highest level of professionalism. After his suggestions, we ordered four appetizers - the steak tartar, braised octopus, tartine du jour, and selection of three cheeses.  The steak tartar and octopus came out first - and both were delicious. The tartar was seasoned to perfection and topped with a quail egg. The octopus was tender and vibrant which went well beside the heavier steak tartar. We were given warm baguette and butter to accompany it.  The tartine du jour was mozzarella and cherry tomato - very good but not as great as the previous two dishes. The cheese was divine!! We were given two French cheeses - Gouda and a very luscious Brie, as well as a manchego from Spain.  For mains, we had the steak frites and the ricotta gnocchi scampi. The steak was a very generous portion and cooked a perfect medium. The fries weren't forgotten - crisp, well seasoned, and served with a house made aioli. The gnocchi was truly unforgettable. Light, fluffy, and starch free. Smothered in an incredible scampi sauce and topped with sous vide prawns. The flavor was incredibly rich and memorable! I would return simply for the sauce if I could.  All in all, Le Notre has quickly established itself as a star french restaurant in the city - I would highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Amazing French bistro, just what Toronto has been missing! I've already been twice, and I'll for sure be back again shortly. The first time I had a perfect set menu, and the second time we went a la carte. The place is cozy, service is spot on and the food was everything I wished for. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Serguei was a gracious host and the food was fantastic! This cozy French restaurant offers a great ambiance and delicious food, and looks out onto sunny, vibrant Harbord st. Try it out, you won't be disappointed! ..Sharing plates, gnocci, burgers, steaks, its all quality food. The service was excellent, attentive but not overbearing, and the owner personally explained each dish. 5 star!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant on the weekend for dinner with my husband. This is a little French bistro with decent prices and food. We tried the soup of the day, which was a leek and apple broth. It was a novel idea, but tasted like apple juice. We also tried the fois gras which was creamy and good. For mains we had the steak frites and pork chop. The dishes were good but not great, I feel like they were lacking something. A sauce would have added some extra dimension to the flavors. For dessert we shared the house made chocolate layered pastry, garnished with some orange preserves. I enjoyed the dessert, but the portion was quite small and  my sweet tooth wanted more. Likely the best thing about this restaurant is the service. The staff were very attentive and friendly. Overall, I would recommend the restaurant but there are better French bistros in Toronto."}
