{"text":"Customer service is horrible. I have been here multiple times and everytime i call in the lady at the register that takes the orders is consistently rude and acts as if i am bothering her by placing an order. I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt but the last time i tried to call in and place an order she was mumbling and talking low.. i couldnt understand her and asked her to repeat herself and she got irritated started yelling at me. There is way too many options for chinese food in the area for anyone to settle for being treated like this."}
{"text":"I looked at their menu. I saw Szechuan dumplings in Hot Oil. My mouth was watering. I called to place order. They don't have that. WTF??? Oh well...back to surfing."}
{"text":"I miss this place! Definately the best take out Chinese food in the Charlotte area. I'm a huge fan of Chinese food and I have to say this was by far the best quality chinese food that I had since I've moved to Charlotte. Every dish that I've had is delicious! 

Chopsticks is located close to the University area and its kind of hidden so if you don't live in the area you wouldn't even know it was there. But the food is really good. 

My favorites from there are their pork friend rice, sesame chicken, and boneless spare ribs! You will definately taste their difference between their food and other Chinese places.

I wish Southpark would have a Chopsticks!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from this establishment several times partly due to its location but I have always felt that the service was poor. Today I called in to place an order and the employee that took my order was so rude that I called back and canceled my order. As I attempted to place my order, the employee attempted to rush me off the phone and then mocked me when I did not use the exact names on the menu to order. I do not appreciate being disrespected when trying to support an establishment and do not plan on purchasing from this establishment again. The sad part is that their food is actually not bad.

Happy customers= profits!"}
{"text":"My husband and I contemplated getting food from them today, because they make great sha cha chicken and shrimp egg foo young.  We decided to stop patronizing there because they treat their customers too rude.  
Even though we went regularly, we were still treated rude, by both the husband and wife.  On one visit I told the husband, \" you know, your food is good, but you guys are extremely rude.\"  I certainly hope it's not racial, because the majority of their customers are non-white.  Regardless, they won't get another penny from us."}
{"text":"Rude customer service and horrible food. Do not eat here. Roaches are visible in the restaurant dining room.  They told me they didn't have sweet tea or fortune cookies. Do not eat here ever this place is disgusting."}
{"text":"Best fresh chinese food. No body have time to be rude and nobody waste the time to be rude"}
{"text":"Very mediocre Chinese food, at best. I get take out from here from time to time simply because I live really close to this location, but I've never had anything that impressed me. Their prices are pretty good and you get a good portion, which is why I still occasionally eat their food.

If you want something delicious, you're probably not going to find it here. If you want something quick, with a good portion and reasonable prices, that you can find here."}
{"text":"The egg rolls and lo mein are good.  Fried rice is good as well.  I have had a few other dishes (chicken and broccoli) that were good as well.  The only dish I don't like is the general tso's chicken.  I would probably give this place 4 or 5 stars if this dish was good (it is my favorite dish to get at chinese places when done well) but it is just bad here.  The chicken is grizzly and horrible quality.  I feel like they use whatever they trim off the chicken and broccoli chicken in the general tso's chicken.  It is such a shame to be honest.  Everything else has been good but the general tso's is low quality."}
{"text":"The food is not extraordinary, but it's not too bad. However, that is not enough to cover up the TERRIBLE customer service. 

My son went in to order alone and came out very frustrated. He said the lady taking the orders was very disrespectful and rude! 

They have the boneless spareribs he likes so I stopped by one day to surprise him with an order, sure enough again...you guessed it! She was rude! 

Unacceptable! Does this lady know there are other Chinese food restaurants in the area?!?"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I had to return to this dump. My neighbor is down for a few weeks after having had surgery and she called me on Saturday afternoon and asked if I could stop and pick up Chinese food for her. She said she would call and place the order. She texts me and tell me she ordered here. I was pissed!  I should have just asked what she wanted and stopped at one of the hundred Chinese spots along my route home. Of course, they are still nasty and rude (even while taking your money). I told my neighbor, only because you are sick did I stop at this restaurant. The place is dirty inside and they don't deserve to be in business. I don't understand how people patronize them simply because the food is cheap and tastes good. Check out Cottage, I think they are better."}
{"text":"food is good. owner & staff just pain nasty and rude"}
{"text":"This is a nasty restaurant! Not only did they have a 93 the last time and they had flies so big no wonder their score was so low. The lady took money, wiped her nose and went right back to preparing food. I can only imagine how the rodents look crawling around back.the worst service I will drive a little further for cleanliness and better service!"}
{"text":"Food is good but the server/manager sucks. He was very rude when taking our orders. Called in for a pick up and went to go pick it up...it wasn't even made."}
{"text":"The food is always good...which keeps me going back. But the lady taking orders is absolutely the worst...no matter how pleasant you are...she's always rude...I saw her husband taking a phone order and he was rolling his eyes and slamming his fist on the counter because the caller asked about the menu price."}
{"text":"Great food, horrible customer service. The lady that usually takes the orders is always rude on the phone, never greets anyone properly, and sounds like she hates life. The worst part is she doesn't pretend to be grateful for the people that are keeping her family business afloat. If it weren't for the fact that they make the best lo-mein I've had in Charlotte, they would never get another penny from me. So I only order every now and then when I'm really craving it. They need to change their attitudes towards customers."}
{"text":"If I could give it negative stars I would, horrible customer service and the chicken seems like it's been sitting for a while. The lady at the front didn't ask us any questions or even greet us"}
{"text":"I was nervous after reading all of the reviews but decided to check this place out. The food is decent for a fast food restaurant. This place is a takeout restaurant and no sitting in. I could see them having difficulty communicating with others because they are foreign. For me it was any other normal ordering experience lol."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE customer service. Food is good, but the service makes me cringe and not ever want to order again! The wife is very rude & she is the person who takes the orders and telephone support. I cant believe this place is still in business with the many complaints they have."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, but the service is so horrible I dropped their rating.  I would rather spend my money on places that want it.  This is despite giving them several chances, hopeful someone else would take the order or work the counter."}
{"text":"You know when you work full time and are a full time student it's great to have a place that'll deliver but it sucks that it tends to take a while for it to get to you. The food is good. Some dishes are awesome and then some are not so good. I usually get beef broccoli and I've realized that on occasion it'll be an ok item to eat from here then other days its the best ever. I do know that they have some awesome pork egg rolls. When I first moved up here i searched everywhere around me to find some good egg rolls about 6 restaurants later I found this place ha. 
The people that take the orders are usually anal and have a bad attitude not sure why I mean when I order I do tend to help them stay in business most places I think would be happy. Oh and if you don't tip they usually talk in Chinese to the people In the back and show the receipt pointing which usually tends to make it obvious as to what's wrong. 
Moral to the story if your needing something fast then this is the place but if you want the best of the best I'd say look elsewhere."}
{"text":"The rice was awful and plain. The Mongolian beef was mostly onions. Very little meat."}
{"text":"Just like everyone else has written, good food but TERRIBLE customer service.

Their chicken wings are some of the best Chinese chicken wings around here. Their dishes are pretty decent.

They look downtrodden. The lady is rude and has a serious attitude problem. The husband is no better. When I'd go there years ago, they seemed friendlier. Oh well, people change."}
{"text":"This is a decent Chinese place that will deliver to the Wyndham Place/University Commons neighborhood. I enjoy the orange chicken and the won ton soup. However, the wait is pretty lengthy but they do make up for it in large portions."}
{"text":"This one particular time I got service with a smile and my food was hot. I love their chicken and broccoli. 
The lady up front has been cheering up over time. I'm going to continue shopping with them."}
{"text":"Bourbon chicken is good. Dumplings are good. Spring rolls ehhhh. i understand everyone has bad days but the lady on the phone is always rude and acts like your business is an inconvenience. I go here because its convenient."}
{"text":"The chicken wasnt great at all. I dont like to bring them down but it was just not...chicken"}
{"text":"Best Chinese good ever. Terrible service,they are rude and don't look happy also I noticed their sanitation score keeps decreasing it was 90% and to me that is low..."}
{"text":"As much as I'd like to say the lady is rude, i think it's more of a cultural difference more so than being rude. The food is always good when I order, granted it's rare since I only get it when I'm in town to visit my sister. Great portions but be forewarned the language barrier can complicate ordering."}
{"text":"Omg I'm just glad it's not me the customer service is always terrible I really wish I could find another place close but with good Chinese food! Again the food good but service is very very very very terrible"}
