{"text":"Nice restaurant but do not come here if you are looking for good all you can eat sushi. They do not serve sashimi and all their nigiri sushi is mostly rice with a very thin layer of fish. The fish tasted a bit off as well. The grills are nice but you end up paying for a very expensive bbq at $27. I am usually not difficult with restaurant reviews but this was by far the worst sushi I have had in a long time, and I cannot even say that \"you get what you pay for\" as the price was on the expensive side. If you are into \"all you can eat rice\" then go for it. Dessert ice cream was, how should I put it, disgusting. The reason for the 2 stars was for the smiley touchy-feely waiter. They could do much better. Oh well, won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was incredible, the servers were amazing. Clean smell, great vents to limit the exhaust!  Good all around!"}
{"text":"New Korean BBQ place in Montreal First thing that got my attention was the decoration and the dim light effect which makes the environment relaxing and perfect for a date! The second big thing was the ventilation system for each table. Finally, a Korean BBQ in Montreal that did it!  Buffet style, which is enjoyable.  I tried all the meats offered. THEY HAD LAMB OMGOGMGOMGOG.  It tasted damn good. Juicy pieces of lamb kbbq style. I swear,being a fan of lamb meat, this made my day.  I also tried the sushi they offered. Some of them was really fancy. Definitely worth a try.  Side dishes came with the meal.  Another thing that surprises me was the paper sheet they use on the grill that helps to retain excess fat and cleanliness of the grill. We could asked the waiter to change it if needed.  Friendly staff. Good service. My glass of water was always full. Chinese/ Korean music on big TV. Good place for date, double date or chilling with friends.  Awesome location to be in Montreal Chinatown. It's pricey. For the quality and experience we get, it's worth it. I also saw a VIP room where there was KTV and seats on the ground.  I would definitely go there with a group.  Best korean BBQ in Montreal so far."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Sushi place in Chinatown.  It hasn't been open for many years so it's still a bit of a secret gem in the area.   The place has a neo-japanese decor with a youth vibe. The staff and service are welcoming and prompted.   I give this place props for being so quick on brining out your order. We also arrived 45 minutes before last call and they accepted us and we were able to eat every plate clean.   The quality of the sushi rolls is very good. (I have extremely high standards when it comes to my sushi and sashimi). Also, since the beef and fish (for the Korean BBQ grill part) are very good too. And fresh avocado - no brown spots or day old.  With all you can eats and Korean BBQ - the plates add up and there is little space to manoeuvre around - The service is really quick on delivering your order and cleaning up your plates. As well as water service and drink service.   And if it matters to anyone (like it does to me) The dish wear is surprising delightful. I pay attention to dish-wear and their tea set (I ordered green tea) was a delightful little set. (I should have taken a picture - I will next time, there will be a next time).   Since it's an growing business - and I have been there a few times - I have seen the progress in their service, menu design and even dish wear. I think they are on the right track.   And if you happen to be greeted by the two owners - they are charming, chatting, attentive and welcoming - making you feel VIP."}
{"text":"Not bad for a korean bbq/sushi buffet. I think the bbq aspect is better than the sushi or kitchen type items in terms of quality. Although the chicken wings are very good and crispy. I'm not sure if the place qualifies as \"all you can eat\" as I went here with my boyfriend a couple of months ago, and the waitress who was waiting our table told us we were restricted to only 1 serving of ice cream which is quite disappointing. She brought us another serving, but we were informed that \"it was an exception\". I'd like to point out that we were there for supper on a weekend, so we were paying the higher price point and were told we couldn't have more ice cream. So rating this place 2 stars instead of 3 because of the service and sushi quality could be better."}
{"text":"Sushi was good quality. The concept of Korean BBQ was similar to the one in the country."}
{"text":"Great place, nice staff. its my 2nd time and i'd go back."}
{"text":"Pros: friendly staff, clean environment  Cons: everything else  I took my mom to Montréal for the first time since I fell in love with it the last time I visited, and one of the stops during our visit was Chinatown.    I told her to choose where we will dine for lunch, and she chose this place.  We ordered from the à la carte menu; She got the pork bento box, I got the tofu dolsot bibimbap.  The presentation of her food looked acceptable. Mine, however, absolutely did not.  The stone pot was so hot, it turned my rice into hardtack-like rice krispies, there was barely 1 1/2 Tbsp of carrots, bean sprouts, and squash, and to top it all off, the gochujang didn't even taste like gochujang! I was utterly disappointed, and left hungry.  My mom's pork was very thinly sliced and was half fat, so she ended up throwing half of it out.    To be fair, I do want to say that my mom was born and raised in Korea, and I was born and raised in the U.S. surrounded by Korean FOBs, so we may have much higher standards regarding Korean food.  However, I don't see that as an excuse for non-Korean Asians to pose as Koreans, and potentially ruin their reputation.    I would've given you one star, but our hostess and server were both very kind to us, and everything was quite clean."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue. For starters don't come here for sushi that is their weakness. Their specialty is korean bbq and they do a very good job at it. This place sporadically gets busy so if your are an etoh drinker I recommend getting a pitcher from the get go, which equates to about 3 beers aprox."}
{"text":"J'adore !! Moins sec que Seoul Chako et le service est plus dynamique (je compare les 2 restau car ce sont des concepts similaires + ils n'incluent pas tout de suite 15% dans ta facture, ils te laissent choisir le pourboire que tu veux leur donné, ce que tout les restau devraient faire !) Pour ma part, ce que j'aime bien, c'est le dessert à la banane. Le papier absorbant qu'il faut changer à chaque fois est une assez bonne idée ! Le décor est cool."}
{"text":"Very good they have a lot of various meat and their ice cream are so delicious, the service was really good ! Fried banana a little dry but overall very satisfied"}
{"text":"Very good place. The meats are pretty tasty but sort of similar in taste. It looks like they might have used the same marinade for everything. The quality of the meat was good too. The sushi was pretty tasty. The Dragon Eye was the best one and I loved the way it was cut on an angle. They even had fried bananas and those sweet buns with condensed milk which I love! The service was very fast and the decor absolutely beautiful. The tables are not too crowded and the vents above the table actually do help with the smell. I do think Mon Ami BBQ and Sota are slightly better."}
{"text":"Awesome service!!! The waiter and waitress are very nice. Food was okay but good service helps! Will visit again.  Meat is fine.. However, side dishes could be better as they aren't fresh or anything."}
{"text":"I went recently for my birthday and it lives up pretty well to what I expected.  We went on a Sunday for lunch and the selection was pretty huge. 2 kinds of beef,chicken, pork, lamb and many other types of meats to grill.  There's also a sizeable selection of sushi as well as appetizers.  The grill is a bit small so you can't grill too much a a time so it could take longer to feed 5 people.  The service was quite nice but the place really got busy around 2. Its the only AYCE Korean bbq here so hope it does well."}
{"text":"Great Service and amazing food! First time going to this restaurant and the waiters were very helpful with how the ordering and barbecuing works."}
{"text":"Mmmm j'adore ce BBQ coréen. Le peu d'épices qu'ils mettent sur les viandes et fruit de mer et la sauce teriyaki est délicieuse.   Je suis allé deux fois et les deux fois j'ai trouvé les grillades délicieuses. Il y a quand même une grande variété de sushi et sont délicieux. Il y a aussi d'autres petits plats que vous pourrez déguster.  Un gros  Pour les moules géantes, les crevettes, les calmars frits et pétoncles panées. Ah oui et les ananas sur le gril, c'est un gros delice. miam  Je ne sais pas pourquoi, mais le poulet était so so...bref. Je ne prendrai pas du poulet, je n'ai pas tant tripé.  Bref je recommande. La dernière fois que je suis allée, le resto à perdu des points dans le service à la clientèle. Au début, le serveur était super serviable, et venais nous voir. Après avoir reçu notre première commande, le serveur à changé. Il ne venait jamais nous voir. On a dû se lever 2 fois pour demander de l'eau et demander si on allait recevoir tel truc qu'on avait demandé, car ils avaient oublié...  Finalement, le resto est ouvert jusqu'à 2h Am YEA! Et de plus en soirée, c'est environs 26$ par personnes plus taxes. Ce qui extrêmement bien pour tout ce qu'on mange."}
{"text":"Nice all you can eat buffet. Great service and food. Theres also fan on each table. Decent price."}
{"text":"While this place looks alot nicer than Chako, the meats here were sub-par. We ordered beef. beef ribs and chicken. The beef ribs hardly had any meat on them. The problem among all of the meats at Kalbi is that they had 0 seasoning on them, which made them bland. The appetizers and food were alright overall.  Would not come back here again."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and it's been great! All you can eat sushi and bbq, what else could you want?  The service is pretty quick for this type of restaurant, and the sushi is actually pretty decent for the quantity and price. The atmosphere is nice, although I could do without the loud K-pop music the they play in the main room. If you manage to book the separate room they use for larger groups, you won't have to deal with the music problem, and it's pretty private.  If you plan on going on a Friday night or on the weekend, I would recommend making a reservation. It was pretty packed when we went, but they managed to shuffle some things around to get us a table.    * We did have a bit of a problem during my last visit, where they kept insisting that someone at our table had ordered a mixed drink, when everyone had only had water. The five of us each paid our own bill, and they tried to charge each of us for the drink that no one at our table had ordered, or received, even after we told them multiple times that it must have been a mistake. Not pleasant."}
{"text":"Tried this place out since I heard people talking about it. The variety is good but the thing that makes it unique is what makes it a minus for me. It's hard to get a good grill on the food through a parchment so although the cleanup is a breeze, the food suffers in terms of the sear. I would prefer the more popular Soeul Chako that has the actual grilling plate, but to each their own preference."}
{"text":"Un bon à volonté de sushis (les classiques, ne vous attendez pas aux nigiri/sashimis ou à des rouleaux innovants) et grillades coréennes! Par contre, service un peu long (car sous-staffé)"}
{"text":"Not worth a review tbh. Service sucks! In addition, I've been to A LOT of Korean grills!!! This is the first time I've cooked on paper *blank stare. It truly takes away from the nice taste you get from GRILLING you meat with the combination of the grill and flames. The two stars is for the restaurant itself which is very clean and modern. That's it, that's all!"}
{"text":"Quelle belle surprise!!! Il y a peu ce restaurant était un sushi à volonté bas de gamme, mais le propriétaire a changé et voilaaaaa!! Nous voici dans ce BBQ/sushi Coréen vraiment très bon où le service est simplement parfait et les serveurs très aimables. Le choix est plutôt complet, de la viande et des légumes à griller, ainsi que quelques soupes, des tempura et quelques desserts. Le tout à Volonté! La seule raison pour laquelle je n'ai pas mis 5 étoiles, c'est que c'était peut être un poil trop cher, 26.99$ ... Allez y le ventre vide et dans ce cas vous en aurez pour votre argent!"}
{"text":"It's totally not Korean Kalbi at all for the short ribs here. Most of the meat taste the same and on the salty side (even I love salty but I complained) Probably they want you to eat with rice so less meat..I guessed :-). Service was ok but they don't grill for you unlike most of the waiters in our town. The place was clean. Sushi and rolls are better than the meat. Ice cream are good too."}
{"text":"Nice Korean restaurant!  Atmosphere : the main room is dark with no window. There are two rooms by the windows, great for groups and very bright!   Service: staff was nice and also speaks French. We waited a bit but that was expected because we were a big group.   Food : we had a blast with the Korean barbecue (all you can eat). My friends liked the bibimbap.   Will come back when I'm in Chinatown."}
{"text":"My lunch there was quite disappointing. On the plus side they were able to accommodate our large group by sitting us in the private dining area. The service was effective and courteous and the food was served in large portion and plentiful. Either their ventilation was quite effective or the use of the paper lining minimised the smell but I left there without stinking cooked food.   On the negative side the food was barely seasoned albeit the lamb was excellent. One of my pleasures eating at Korean restaurants is to enjoy the different types of kimchi. This restaurant only serves the traditional cabbage one.  It seems this restaurant tries to attract a broad range of patrons and therefore lost the bold and authentic Korean flavours in the way."}
{"text":"A new style of Korean grill that uses paper grilling.  I have been to several Korean grills, the only thing that annoys that after longtime of grilling, the grill pan gets black and charred, and all that food gets stuck on the grill pan and you eat the char as well.  Paper grilling is more healthier and less greasy.   They have all kinds of assorted meats and vegetables.   Don't know why they charge 0.50 extra if you want lettuce??  That's puzzling...  The sushi and handrolls were very freshly made.  The only downside was the ice cream, it had no flavour, especially the green tea ice cream, no green tea flavour at all."}
{"text":"Très bon et surprenant pour un resto de China town... le service est numéro 1 et surtout en français yéééé . Le seul hic c'est la position des jambes sous les tables. Si tu n'es pas assis aux extrémités des tables, tu dois manger reculé car le système BBq prend énormément de place. Dommage car Seoul Chako n'avait pas ce problème. Mais bon, si vous êtes invités à vous y rendre, arrivez en premier"}
{"text":"Terrible food. Literally not good at all... except the crispy French fries. Will never visit again"}
{"text":"This place was merely ok. Service was super slow. The bbq in the table was a fun gimmick but you spend most of your time tending to the various foods you are trying to cook. In South Korea you would have the back of your hands slapped by the server if you tried to tend to your grilling food. It would show that they were not serving you properly. We ordered the following: -Wonton Soup  (it was good) -Peanut Butter Wontons (tasted fine) -Kimchi (I really liked it but probably straight from a jar) I'm a kimchi junkie -Imperial roll (dry) -sweet potato tempura (the miniature servings should be mentioned - 2 silver dollar size pieces -Fried Calamari rings (smallest serving ever seen, also smallest rings ever. About 5 the size of a quarter, tasteless. Stick to grill. -fried sweet bun (these are good) -fried dumplings (not bad) -Fried Chicken Wings (would be better with some hot sauce!) -Katsu Chicken (doesn't ring a bell!) -Onions (laughable how few and how thin) -Broccoli (steamed wilted mini flouretts) -beef ribs ( ultra thin, poorly trimmed, mostly bone and fat) -Sausage (thin sliced ronds of a sausage link) odd texture and taste, not bad just different -Beef (thin sliced beef to grill. Could use some seasoning, like salt and pepper. (This was my favourite)  We washed it all down with a few Cans of Sapporo.   We left full and we were good with everything but just need to say it's not the finest food. But you can have a good time here."}
{"text":"The staff was really friendly but overall I didn't like my experience. I ordered a bunch of stuff and they ended up never coming. I had to ask a few times but never received my full order. Also, they advertised a 30% off discount but when I went they didn't even have the scanning machine. It wasn't a big deal but don't advertise it if you don't have it. The meats were just okay, nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"Came here for AYCE with some friends. I like how they have the vents because we didn't smell too BBQ'd by the end! The meat was not good though: not as marinated and seasoned as other BBQ meats I've had, especially Korean ones. And like other reviewers have said, the sushi is really good! We actually kept ordering sushi and had to very reluctantly finish the meat. I'd be willing to come again just for the sushi haha!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, better choice of sushis then Seoul Chako, but their food is lack of flavor.  Healthier choice of Korean BBQ, less burned food since they are using wax paper."}
{"text":"Nice venue and love their bbq grill setup. Couldn't be happier with meat and more meat but all of this is lacking a little marinade, ssamjang and garlic to cross the finish line with more stars.  Short veggies/banchan selection to choose from and sushi side of the menu gets an appetite going while working the grill.  Parking meter up front, daily parking around the corner and free parking after 6pm in the back street.  Gunbae!"}
{"text":"I've heard so much about this place and was interested in trying it as I love korean restaurants. We walked in and the place seemed a little off. I was disappointed with the food. The parchement paper on the grill made the food steamed and not grilled, the kimchi was too acidic, probably too much lemon, the fan on top of the grill was not working, the sushi wasn't good either. I will not go back."}
{"text":"I'm from a big city in the states where we have many KBBQ restaurants. This is my first time going to a KBBQ restaurant in Canada.   1. This place is very clean and has a nice ambience. Hip hop music videos stream on the TV as well the speakers.  2. They have a sushi chef on deck, which I've never seen before in the states. I only ordered the salmon hand roll, which was good; the fish was fresh.   3. I went on a Wednesday, which is ladies' night. They put a cup of sangria in front of me as soon as I sat down, which I thought was nice. They did not refill my cup voluntarily; I had to ask.  4. In the states the servers place a variety of sides (salad, potatoes, bean sprouts, kimchi, etc.) on your table, sometimes before you're seated. Only kimchi was placed on the table as a side, but sides were available to order on the menu.  5. There was not a large variety of meat. The only \"beef\" on the menu was similar to brisket. In the states you can order 6 or 7 different types of cuts of beef. Also, the beef flavor was ok; nothing popping with flavor.  Overall this place was just ok. I ate until I was content. I am just visiting Montréal, but probably won't go back or recommend this place.i"}
{"text":"Overall great experience! The place is clean, classy, nice dim ambiance (my bae and I went on a date). I could've done without the cheesy k-pop ballads personally though. Great service, decent food, average flavor profile, nice variety. Great destination for parties / groups.  I've been to Kanda and Chako, which are similar all you can eat sushi and grill joints, but this one was the nicest. There is a vent right above your table's grill, and a parchment type sheet is placed on the grill's surface, which is so much healthier, cleaner (and easier for them to maintain too). Result, less fatty grilled items with reduced risk of charring (which reduces your risk of eating cancerous compounds).  The service was great! Super nice and attentive, which I value a lot.  The menu items are simple. Nothing popped flavor-wise. It was all decent and filling. (If you want flavor, I recommend Biiru). I did love the seaweed salad, salmon sashimi, grilled ribs, and fried sweet bread for dessert (mmmm)!   I've been to quite a few all you can eat  places in Mtl, and so far this one is the best. Cleanliness is my biggest concern and I didnt leave with food poisoning. I left with a smile   I'll be back."}
{"text":"Positive :   Good venue Nice staff Fresh veggies and meat Fun experience Great KBBQ Good pricing  Near metro place des armes    Negative:   When i went to Kalbi, there was only one waitress. She was very nice and polite but the service was slow. On a busy friday afternoon (1h30-3h00), she had to do everything (serve us and be at the cash register). I dont blame her, i blame the manager.   Sushi needs improvement. Ex: Dragon eyes are fried to long, too much rice in some sushi..."}
{"text":"On Saturday evening, I came with a reservation for a great Korean bbq meal. My first impression of the place is that it was very well maintained and the service was alright for a busy Saturday.   They seated us a bit further away from the main entrance and close to the bar. I took a look at the menu and I was disappointed by the lack of varieties of the menu. The meats selection were bare and the sushis were lacking in flavors. We spent the majority of our orders on the same meats; Beef, chicken, pork and calmar. The quality of their food is probably better than Seoul Chako but they lack the varieties that their competitor has. The only drink I got was a white wine Sangria and it was delicious. Since they accommodated me with a glass of Sangria, they only sell by the pitcher for more than two drinkers and I was the only one who drank that night.   Overall, I think I will give this place three stars for a start. I hope they increase their choices in the future. I see opportunities for them to be a very well established Korean bbq place because their customer service is a lot better than Seoul Chako."}
{"text":"The food was okay... The service were really slow even though there were not a lot of customers :/ Personally, I like Seoul Chako better; it has more flavor"}
{"text":"Oh, so many issues with this restaurant. First thing, this is an all-you-can-eat sushi and Korean beef buffet. That means you cannot pay for menu items separately. I tell you this now because the staff will not explain this to you before you order. They also won't explain that there is a disclosure on the menu that says \"$1 extra will be charged per piece left on the table.\" So you better eat everything you ordered or you will be charged extra per sushi. Also, they do not explain what is in the sushi. \"The New York roll is with salmon, the Quebec roll has cream cheese in it.\" No further context. We got a great laugh out of this place and the food was pretty good but this system is so incredibly bizarre. If you know what you're getting into, great! If not, be ready to smuggle sushi rolls in a napkin to the bathroom when you're stuffed so you don't get overcharged for not eating it."}
{"text":"We walked by this place very often but never really interested in trying. My coworker came here once and said the foods are not bad. Others said the service was horrible. We gave it the benefit of the doubt and give it a try. Came for Mother's Day dinner of 5 ppl and an 8 month old baby.   Atmosphere: When we arrived, surprisingly there are a lot of ppl but then they kind of closed 1/4 of the seating area. Anywhoo, the decor remain the same as previous sushi restaurant, nice and spacious but very hot and humid. Maybe it's an indoor bbq or maybe they forgot to turn on ac. Not very comfortable esp with a baby. Most cooling place in the restaurant is the toilet.   Food:  Decent, I like the sushi. But I found other Korean bbq place has an upper hand on menu and flavor in meats. Everything is somewhat blend and tasteless. I never like bbq on a piece of paper, took away the \"grilled\" texture. Some food seems to be prepare ahead of time and they just microwaved (octopus balls) for you. Some fried food is under fried (fried bun is mushy inside) and some food is over fried (calamari). The ribs are extremely chewy. I like the fish surprisingly. I usually hate bbq fish because they fall apart after cooking.   Service: The person greeted us seems not too happy. But the rest of the evening, all the waiter/waitress served us are very friendly. But they do tend to forget our order and kind of slow. The sushi came out faster than the raw meat for some reason. The lady changed our paper took our clamp and never return it...  Overall: Forgetting orders or giving you the wrong order are very very typical in an all you can eat places, in Montreal at least. So I suggest you to take a pic of your order before submitting.  Overall, the restaurant is okay; the reason I gave 1 star is because they charged my baby which is 8 months old. I understand if you eat something, you should charge them. But an 8 months old can't even eat any solid! Charge her for what? A glass of hot water or a seat on the table?!? We were 5 people, you have to give us a table that can accommodate minimum of 6 people anyway! We didn't now they will charge 4 years or younger regardlessly. If we knew, we won't even consider this place. We were not happy at all. We won't be coming back nor recommend it. There are far more better kbbq in Montreal; good food, decent services AND they don't charge your 'non-solid eating infant' for being there."}
{"text":"Kalbi est un resto de BBQ coréen et sushi à volonté. Il semble aussi offrir un menu midi express pour ceux qui veulent juste un bibimbap ou une soupe.    Le resto est bien situé au quartier chinois, distance de marche du métro place d'armes. On est allé un dimanche midi. Il n'y avait pas beaucoup de monde, le service a été quand même rapide.  La bouffe était bonne: la viande était bien marinée et les sushis étaient frais. Il n'y avait par contre pas beaucoup de choix de sauce pour le BBQ. J'ai bien aimé leur concept de cuisson de papier qui absorbe l'excès de l'huile, et leur système de ventilation pour évacuer la fumée du grillade. Ça rend l'expérience plus agréable :)"}
{"text":"Good service. Not very busy place.  I like the presentation of sushi. I can see the passion in the chef. However, I would like to choose a restaurant by the quantity of its customer, which in a way to ensure the freshness of the ingredient, especially for an all-you-can-eat place. I believe, this place is a good choice mainly on weekends. The meat was cut too thin. Losing the texture. Flavor-wise I like them. The ventilation was OK, no worries to smell like BBQ after dinner. The best part is to use a paper on the grill. May be seen as a consolation of health. May come in once in a while."}
{"text":"3.5/5 Good service Modern restaurant Upstairs in china town Great price for lunch on a wednesday was 17 dollars (dont forget the 15%tax though)  You cook on a grill with parchment paper on it which helps the food not to burn and keeps moisture in it. You check off what you want to eat on a list. All you can eat Hot prepared food and soups aswell as cold sushi style and raw bbq items Beef was good, short ribs good, pork good Not a whole lot of seasoning. Did not have shrimp to grill (maybe just because it was lunch im not sure??) Only hot sauce and some sort of oil to season your food. Rolls are decent  Fresh fish on the sushi pieces  Fried Scallops means deep fried Charge for uneaten food to prevent waste"}
{"text":"Sushi wasn't that great the rice was a little bit dry and some of the sushi smelled a little fishy. The beef was really good but the ribs we're full of fat and we couldn't eat most of them.  The waitress was really friendly and nice. The place is very clean and doesn't smell because of the vents"}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant for my gf and another friend's birthday.   I go to Seoul Chako BBQ very often. For a comparison,   Kalbi offer more healthy environment to eat. They have grill paper to absorb more oil and fat. They got a vent to absorb the smoke and smell. Their meats are less salty. You can season by yourself. You have more options on the menu.   Place is smaller but I think better than Seoul Chako.   The price is same as Seoul Chako. Lunch/Dinner/Late night."}
{"text":"25$ for all you can eat lunch is on the expensive side based on the selection they have. The grilled meat is not very oily but doesn't have any distinct flavour. The sushi selection wasn't large and  the quality was alright (rice was dry). The fried calamari was weak (too much of none crispy batter and the calamari wasn't seasoned). Overall, it's good to have a new k bbq in town, but there is much more room for improvement."}
{"text":"Went there on a weekend night with friends. Place is really clean, love the ventilation system (I did not smell bad when I got out of there). They have the usual KBBQ stuff, and you can season your meat with the two sauces at your table, they are both quite good. Service is really efficient, dishes came out quickly, and we did not even have to ask for the waiter to change the paper on the grill. Really a good place to hang out and have fun, will definitely return."}
{"text":"Weirdly this place has really good sushi compared to the meat. Still, the meat was pretty good, just a bit bland so we peppered/salted everything. The only thing that upset me was that they didn't offer any drink options except water unless you are willing to pay extra. The price is also a bit pricey--my bill came up to 35 including tip for lunch but I believe it's a decent price for what you are paying. If you want a relatively good AYCE and don't care too much about the money come here!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and style in the restaurant and it's great for group reservations.  Though it's not your typical Korean BBQ, they offer a wide variety of meats and vegetables that you can pop on the grill (built-in on each table). They have traditional Chinese and Japanese dishes as well, ranging from Sushi to Chicken Katsu and Hot and Sour soup.  We tried to taste a little bit of everything and we were very pleased with the quality of the food. The orders didn't take long to come to the table and the wait staff was very helpful.  I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Went here for my husband's surprise party. Since we were 21, we got the private room. It was soooo fun!!! The service was excellent. They were so nice and patient with us. The food was really good and fresh. A huge choice of different kind of meats, sushis and other great dishes! It also helps a bit to have a fan that sucks up the smokes from the grill.   Sometimes when you go to an all-you-can-eat buffet, they tend to slow down the service or even give you a crappy service if you over indulge. Not here. We ate till we dropped end the waiter kept on asking if we wanted more! Haha. Cute! I didn't have much expectations about this restaurant but boy was i ever so pleased to have come here. We even have some really good beats in the room. Everything was great! I will be coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"Oh my how beautiful!!! A very clean Korean barbeque restaurant with fantastic A+ service. Service alone is 5 stars. Cleanliness makes it 6 stars! With ventilation at every table. This restaurant uses paper lining to keep the grill clean. I love this because my companions, despite my best efforts, tend to burn all parts of the grill.  Ok the food is just 3 stars. In fact maybe 2. It's acceptable because it's Montreal. But overall it's not that great.  Every meat is thinly sliced, which is great because you can cook faster. But it's not very flavourful. The beef ribs are alright and are the best among the meat options. The chicken is tasteless!  Meat: beef, pork belly, beef rips,  chicken, ox tongue, spicy and non-spicy sausage (Chinese kind), lamb.  Seafood: salmon, squid, shrimps, mussels, fish fillet.  I actually ordered sushi to fill my stomach.  Monday to Thursday it's $24.99 Friday to Sunday it's $26.99 How much does ventilation help in preventing your hair and clothes from smelling like Korean BBQ? 80%!!! Almost 90%. My hair gently smelled like barbeque but my sweater didn't keep too much smell! Also because the restaurant was empty for Tuesday lunch, only 3 other tables.  But our waiter that day seriously is so amazing!!!! He's the best I've seen in Korean BBQ, but also one of the best in the city!!!!! Yes I can compare this guy's service to some insanely high-end luxury Michelin-star restaurant. He can totally work there!"}
{"text":"première fois dans un BBq coréen.  J'ai bien aimé mon expérience.  j'y retournerai mais pas trop souvent.   le midi et le soir sont deux style différent.  durant la journée il y a le menu à la carte. le soir c'est cuisson sut le grill à volonte pour 30$. la fin de semaine,  Il y a des plats de plus sur le menu à volonté.   mercredi et jeudi sont des soirées spéciale pour le dames,  sangria gratuite ou 3e drink.  le menu offre beaucoup de choix, du porc,  du boeuf,  du poulet,  des légumes,  des sushis, Et j'en passe. Il y a vraiment beaucoup de choix.   par contre,  Rien est assaisonné.  C'est un plus et un moins parce qu'il n'y a rien pour assaisonné,  seul de la sauce soya,  sauce épicé et une autre sauce.  j'aurais aimé des assaisonnement qu'on met sur la viande pendant la cuisson.   la cuisson est sur un papier,  ce qui permet de boire le gras des aliments et rend le tout plus santé.   le service etait tres bien malgré quil n'y avait pas grand monde, Mais mon expérience à ce niveau était très bien.   personnellement,  le prix et le manque d'assaisonnement me fond couper une étoile,  Mais ça reste une belle expérience."}
