{"text":"First time at Smash and was taking  a colleague for lunch.  I was greeted and seated immediately, but it took the server 15 minutes to come over and ask me if I wanted a drink.  My guest arrived and after another 10 minutes we flagged down another server to get my guest a drink and place our order.  The food arrived (we both had lobster mac and cheese - lots of lobster) in good time and was very good.  I would go back again if I'm the area, but the service was horrible.  The food makes me give it three stars or it would have got two based on the service."}
{"text":"Recommend this place for weekend brunch. Their regular lunch/dinner menu is getting boring and the last few times I have gone and ordered their salads I have been very disappointed. The quality here is going downhill. Hope this changes soon."}
{"text":"A couple of us came here after seeing a show in the city. We didn't have a reservation(would recommend) and were lucky to get a table seeing as it was a Sat night and even though it was 8pm it was still busy.  I wanted to come here as I was in the mood for ribs and I came across this place on yelp.  The ribs did not disappoint.  Two of us had the ribs and they were fantastic, fall off the bone. The flat iron steak was also ordered and it was also great.   the restaurant is in the corner of a small strip plaza and I don't think I would ever had noticed if we weren't looking for it. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried their Winterlicious special last night and it was great! The meals were more than sufficient in quantity and deliciousness. The service was also great - manager was always checking in with the customers even though it was super busy.   Will come back to try the Smash burger."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Smash and this place is phenomenal! Tucked away on Highway 7 in a shopping plaza this place doesnt sound like its up to much but your wrong. Hands down one of the best meals I have had in Toronto, amazing staff and beautiful inside.   We had the lobster mac and chesse, steak brisket, banana cake for dessert and some cocktails - all amazing! and fast too!   I cannot rave about this place enough. Will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Really hit and miss here! Some days are good and others are not so good. The oil that is used to deep fry the fries needs changing. You can tell when the the oil is dirty, the fries are not bright or crispy they are dark and soggy and you can see the oil is soaked in the potato! Changed fries 3 times, all same results. Manager said, oil changed a day ago, owner said, that morning. I was in the F&B business, I have seen with my own eyes that they deep fryer sometimes goes way over the \"supposed\" to limit. Commercial (ie restaurant) oil is re-used many times. It is called \"fry life\" in the biz. But these oils are formulated with additives and stabilizers for commercial use which extend their life. A typical heavy duty decent quality commercial oil has a \"fry ratio\" of maybe 15 or 16, meaning that you can fry 15+ lbs. of stuff (typically french fries) per pound of oil. Thus, a 35 lb. box of oil will fry maybe 600 lbs. of potatoes. This will take many fryings possibly over many days. Many restaurants have a rule of thumb of changing their oil on the same day every week, but of course it depends..... Good restaurants are diligent about keeping their oil clean, by filtering to get the charred bits out. Unfortunately, most restaurants are not so diligent. You don't even want to know. Of course, oil also needs to be use to give fried foods flavour, so many chefs may mix a little of the old oil in with the new oil, but you won't have a gross after taste. Sorry, to emphasis so much on the deep fryer, but this stuff is going into our tummies and through the liver for break down. I didn't go to smash looking for a free lunch! I just wanted a lunch that I could enjoy and leave satisfied. Even after complaining \"nicely\" and having 3 different servings or fries changed out and reserved, none of them were \"eaten\" just taste tested. The Manager, still brought my bill over full price. If the fryer is icky and the manager has spoken to the customer, acknowledged that the fries that came with the main were indeed icky, but still chooses to charge full price. I don't know what to say! These days, how you treat your customers can actually be more important than the food quality, It can be the ultimate result between a good review or a meh, review. It's not always about the food."}
{"text":"The food is really good, especially the buttermilk fried chicken and ribs The only problem I had was I waited for over 5 minutes to get a table, even though the restaurant wasn't that busy. There were a couple of servers walking around, and they saw us standing by the door, yet no one asked if we needed help. It would be nice if someone at least offered to help. When the hostess finally came to seat us, she did not apologize to us that we waited. The server was great though, he was very knowledgeable in the menu, which is great. He was friendly and nice.   The items are at a reasonable price, and they have a pretty big menu which I like. Overall if it wasn't for the wait, I would have rated this restaurant a 4-5 star."}
{"text":"My family came for lunch on a Monday for their $10 Pizza Special. All pizzas on their menu are $10 on Mondays, which makes it a pretty good deal if you wanted to try one of the more expensive pizzas. The 4 of us shared since it was lunch, so we couldn't eat too much   L.A. Mac & Cheese ($10). Cheesy cavatappi pasta baked with bacon bits and bread crumb. Yum! It's Mac & Cheese with bacon bits, what's not to love! Portion size was ok for the price, its an appetizer so it wasn't too big.   BBQ Brisket Grilled Cheese ($14). The sandwich was made of BBQ brisket, coleslaw, onion rings, a four cheese blend, Smash sauce, and challah bread. It comes with a side, so we choice the Soup of the Day which was a Curried Carrot Soup. I liked the soap, it had a nice sweetness to it from the carrots. I found the bread used for the sandwich too thick for my liking. I'm sure it was to prevent the bread from getting soggy since the brisket was pretty saucy. But it made the sandwich really hard to eat, and I couldn't get all the ingredients at once. My dad was a big fan of the sauce for the BBQ Brisket though.   Neptune Pizza (Normally $17, but special for $10). It had herb garlic butter, mozzarella, tiger shrimp, smoked salmon, red onions, capers, arugula, balsamic. I liked this one a little bit more than the Pride of Nova Scotia Pizza. The crust was perfectly cracker thin and the flavours worked well together.     Pride of Nova Scotia Pizza (Normally $19, but special for $10). It had tomato sauce, mozzarella, lobster pieces , roasted garlic, pico de gallo, shaved parmesan. It was a good pizza overall. I really liked the roasted garlic. I could barely taste the lobster though. This pizza also came out with half the crust on one side slightly burnt, giving several bites a slightly bitter taste.  Overall, I liked this place! We came for lunch, so the place wasn't crowded. Their washroom was clean and they had little hooks near the sink in the women's washroom for you to hang your purse while you wash your hand. I though that was good touch. Their $10 Monday Pizza deal is definitely a really good deal. They also have a 10% off check in special on yelp, but it didn't apply to the pizza deal. I still got 10% off my mac & cheese and sandwich though. I'll definitely be back for the $10 pizza and I look forward to trying some of the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Delicious food!   My order of double patty with egg burger and side of fries was delicious. A bit larger than expected, but that is not a problem as the food was tasty.  The crab cake served with eggs benedict atop tasted out of this world, despite being over deep fried and blackened on the outside.   The service was good, large space inside, would be back.   Brunch runs until 12!"}
{"text":"The service is exceptionally good here. Our waitstaff was very personable, friendly and worked hard to make sure we were having an enjoyable experience. The food is excellent and they have some good week day specials. Best atmosphere in Markham."}
{"text":"Delicious food!!!! Had a party of 16 ppl, our waitress was amazing, and food came out quick!! Great service."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely amazing & craft brew selection was great! The fried chicken anD gravy is to die for. Make sure you call for reservations. It gets quite busy quickly."}
{"text":"Unexpected amazing brunch on Easter Sunday! Crab Cakes Benedict is a must have. Outside so crunchy inside so juicy, their Hollandaise is so good to go with. Smash Benedict is also good. Finally located a good weekend brunch place on Highway 7, less driving more sleeping time.  Caesars is good and is on Sunday special. But coffee is somehow fast food quality."}
{"text":"4.5 STARS  My buddy and I popped in here for a late lunch. What a great place to play hooky from work. The staff were super friendly and the ambiance is really cool. Maybe not the best place to watch a ball game but a nice place to kick back and chill. Started with a couple beers. Not a huge selection on tap, but still plenty for a beer fan like myself. Our pints were nice and cold. Really hit the spot. We started with the meat lovers pizza. Superb. Thin crust. Cooked perfect in their pizza oven. Tasted great and you could tell everything was freshly made. My buddy had the Smash burger with fries. He said it was very good. A man of few words. He cleaned his plate though, so good sign. I had the BBQ beef brisket grill cheese with fries. Fries were very good and plentiful. The brisket is where lunch derailed. So Much Food. I was done. It was cheesy, moist, tender and sweet. So good but I could only finish half the meal. That half sammy is going to make a great lunch tomorrow though. My only complaint is price. Kind of following the trend of pricier bistro type establishments.  Still, it was a really nice experience. Would definitely pick it over a place like Milestones if I were looking for an upscale casual meal."}
{"text":"Come for a classy, intimate dinner and a drink at this hidden resto buried in a strip mall across from a senior's villa (what?).   We came on a Saturday after driving aimlessly towards east Markham, waiting for fate to lead us to some sort of food-serving establishment that would have an iota of ambiance. On a whim, I turned the car into Smash.    AMBIANCE  Intimate and modern. Eschewing normal dangling lights over tables, the designers went for targeted spotlights, either on tables or strategic spots on the walls. Sounds tacky, but successfully creates lit spaces on the table, while allowing for a dim, sexier atmosphere elsewhere. Sexy art! Decent modern art on the walls, not wallfurniture from Wal-Mart (mercifully), adds to the modern feel.  Seating for groups of 6-8, bar stools for cocktails, tables for two, tables for four. Open concept, so no booths that I could see. We were at a table for four.   Good for: -a date -impressing your Mom -classier night out with your friends (that isn't East Beaver Creek. Take that, Richmond Hill!)   FOOD  Italian and par the course for a classy resto. Higher on the payscale but the food quality and portions were good enough that I didn't begrudge the price. We ordered mussels for $12, a caprese beet salad for $14 and onion 'chips' for $8, and a lava brownie.   The mussels were delicious and we sopped up the sauce, which was possibly white wine and tomato-based. I resisted the urge to be a real lady and eat the sauce like soup. Good portion for the price too.   The caprese salad was decent, I enjoyed the balsamic reduction and the addition of the beets. I've had better buffalo cheese (softer, creamier) but can't complain.   Onion chips, meh, fried onion bits with chipotle mayo. Plus, my arteries, ouchie.  The lava brownie was tasty and came with a cute side of blueberries, biscotti, and whipped cream.     SERVICE  We were served by four different people at different times, but they all were professional and pleasant. We noted that our servers made great efforts to make us feel welcome. Our food came quickly and our water was refilled repeatedly.    LOCATION  Good parking, bad signage. At first glance, Smash Kitchen and Bar's yellow sign says 'place to buy furniture', not 'sexy resto, bring your sexy dates'. Close to Unionville's main drag at Highway 7 and Kennedy, it is Viva bus accessible.    OVERALL  Come to Smash for a nice, modern resto experience in fair Markham. It isn't breaking the mold, but it's doing what it's doing right."}
{"text":"This place is great! Service was excellent and the food was amazing. I got the mushroom linguini (with chicken) and the duck fried rice, both were great. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"If your looking for comfort yummy food this is  the local spot.  Our table split one rib app (5 ribs), I was happy with just a little bit so I could also enjoy something else for dinner.  I ordered the coal fired veggie pizza with goat cheese and my buddies ordered the Smash cheese burger. We washed it down with a local draft.    I would come again."}
{"text":"First time there last week. The interior remains unchanged from the old Blue stone restaurant. What we order was great and the service was quick."}
{"text":"What a treat - we visited last Saturday night - around 8PM.  Why I want to go back:  - We weren't too hungry when were there, but saw some interesting items on the menu - will go back for lamb risotto  - We did try their dessert, both were tasty:  red valvet cake & banana bread - Their  appetizers look interesting too, we liked the grill calamari"}
{"text":"I've been to Smash Kitchen & Bar on several occasions before and the service here is always impressive! I came here recently on a busy Friday night for an office Christmas dinner. Our food came out of the kitchen in a timely matter and was plated beautifully.   Appetizers: Only one of each appetizer listed below was ordered to share between 7 people. There was enough in each dish for each person to try a little bit.  Grilled calamari The grilled calamari was cooked perfectly! The texture was soft, not rubbery, and very easy to chew. This dish isn't ideal for sharing.   Garlic cheese bread Three cubes of garlic bread topped with cheese, pico de gallo, and drizzled with a balsamic vinegar reduction. The combination of flavours complemented each other very well.  KFB The broccoli was lightly battered and smothered in Korean ketchup. It was very tasty and I would definitely order this again.  Souther chicken bites These lightly battered chunks of chicken breast were tender and served with BBQ sauce and ketchup on the side.   Main: Piri piri Cornish hen I usually order the \"Smash Burger\", but I opted for something different this time. The Piri Piri Cornish Hen seems to be new on the menu. Although the grilled half hen was tender and juicy, the skin wasn't very flavourful. The smashed potatoes were also rather bland and a bit dry. I disliked the seasonal vegetable on the side (a dark, leafy green that looked like Chinese broccoli with thinner stalks); it was too bitter.  Desserts: Smash mini donuts Warm and fluffy donut holes dusted with cinnamon sugar and powdered sugar, and drizzled with caramel sauce. These mini donuts were not overwhelmingly sweet and very light as a dessert.   Sinful chocolate bar This flourless chocolate cake was dense and rich with flavour. One order was shared among 7 people. I tasted a small square and it was more than enough. I would definitely recommend sharing this dessert due to the richness of the cake."}
{"text":"We were a group of 18 celebrating a family event, adults + kids.  First time customers to Smash Kitchen & Bar.  Overall the food was good, enjoyed the gnocchi, ribs & $5 caesar special.  The kids enjoyed their duck fried rice and chocolate milk.    During our service, the server did make efforts to be engaging with our family, answering our questions and requests.  She was humorous and bright.  There were a couple hiccups and a few instances where I had to step out to search for service and a delay in receiving our desserts and bill towards the end of the night.  Was challenging for the parents who were in attendance and needed to leave.    I provided feedback to the manager @ Smash and he promptly responded in a positive, appreciative manner.  Our patronage was acknowledged and he extended a very kind gesture to our group in order for us to return to the restaurant.    I might add that the server/manager did brought us a complimentary dessert, tasty donuts with a sparkler to help celebrate the evening.     Overall experience turned around."}
{"text":"First time here for brunch. I ordered Smash Benedict and the portion are pretty big and taste pretty good.  The server is friendly and I was impressed with their fast service for food. So happy to find a nice place in Markham for brunch instead of driving downtown."}
{"text":"The draught taps have been down for a week?!? and the bottled beer was warm.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a girlfriend on a weekday. The place was moderately busy and we had a quiet booth so we could catch up. Staff was friendly and easy to deal with. The menus came out quickly as did our drinks. My friend had the Pride of Nova Scotia pizza which was she found to be excellent. I had the Lobster Mac 'n Cheese. The dish was good overall. However the lobster was overcooked and rubbery. I told the server and she quickly had it replaced with one that was cooked properly.  While we were dining, the servers did check on us regularly. However, once the bill was paid and we sat chatting for a while, no one came back to check. It would have been nice to have had a water refill at that point.  Our total bill with 2 mains, 3 glasses wine & 1 coffee, plus tip came to just under $100. As it was a special occasion it was worth the splurge but too much for a regular lunch."}
{"text":"Nice little resto tucked away in the corner of plaza. Food was good. Service was ok except Only comment about service is training younger servers to actually care about their jobs and spot with snotty attitudes towards patrons.   Would come back with family for brunch. Overall enjoyable first dining experience."}
{"text":"Amazing food at decent prices. They sometimes have decent prices on a bottle of wine which is nice."}
{"text":"My friends and I came on a Sunday for brunch and the food was exceptionally delicious.   I had the crab cake benedict and it was cooked to perfection. For those of us that ordered the benedict, it met our standard and satisfied our cravings for a good brunch place uptown. A friend had the meatloaf brekkie and that was delicious as well.   Definitely would recommend this clean, friendly and hidden-in-a-corner restaurant."}
{"text":"This a great hidden gem in Markham!!!!  Tucked in the corner of a plaza on highway 7 near unionville main street.  They have quite a few semi private rooms, that's good for  group dinners, birthday parties,  and they offer a good variety menu,  no minimum charge or prix fix menu required for booking the party rooms.  I'm definitely coming back.. They are known for their thin crispy crust pizza and burger!"}
{"text":"Had the Smash Benedict: poached eggs were a little too overdone, not a lot of pulled pork on the English muffin, not too big of a fan of the gravy sauce  Server was friendly :)"}
{"text":"This place food was ok atmosphere was ok only problem was with the service and when I asked for the manager the manager was just as bad and realized I wouldn't get  any where with my concerns and complaints they all seem like buddy's/ friends working together and will just shrug you off bad business sense ! They just lost me and my friends business and the people that ask us how that place was that know we went , etc but... I guess it would be a good place to work if you just want to have fun with your buddy's / co workers"}
{"text":"Been here for brunch, lunch, and dinner...multiple times. Food is consistently good at all 3 times of day. Hostesses and servers are very friendly."}
{"text":"After reviewing some comments from the yelp, I finally came to this restaurant with some friends for a lunch today. We were seated near to the patio door overlooking a beautiful view of green trees. They have a nice, trendy and well decorated atmosphere with very friendly waitresses.    We didn't feel like to eat burgers or sandwiches today, but they really have some yummy burgers or sandwiches served with soup or salad or fries on the menu.  I definitely will try it next time. We decided to order the following dishes instead...  2 orders of Seafood Paella 1 order of Half Rack and Mac 1 order of Piri Piri Cornish Hen  Also we ordered some beers with the food that was a perfect match for our afternoon gathering. Even though it's a little bit longer than most waiting time, our food came out so flavorful and delicious. We really had a great time with good food and nice ambiance at Smash. Will come back to try other food next time..."}
{"text":"Love this spot!!! I think I've been here 3-4 time already.  Came in for brunch, lunch and dinner. Everything I had here was amazing, from the pizza to the chicken and waffles, the Mac and cheese and the fried chicken with gravy ahh so good!   I would definitely recommend making a reservation for brunch or dinner, the place gets busy!   I would say skip desserts, none of them stand out."}
{"text":"Over rated!! Food was not good at all. Ribs are one of their signature dishes and they were awful. The quality of the pork was not good or they just gave me reheated ribs. Cheese in the beet salad had no taste and the texture was very spongy. Again it may have been old. Will not go back to this restaurant.  I will give 2 stars for service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"We came to Smash for a family dinner. The excellent reviews brought us here. And what can I say that hasn't been said yet, this place is awesome! Staff were super, all attentive! Christine, our server was the best! Ambiance gives me good vibes. I like simple menus, it's not about quantity but quality of options. And the food, you get what you pay for. We ordered: Ahi Tuna Wontons appetizer - out of this world, a must  Angry Lobster Linguini w/ garlic bread - despite the tiny lobster, very good with a kick to it BBQ Baby Back Ribs w/ mashed potato & corn- this is no baby! It's a huge portion, about ten ribs. Fall off the bones goodness! Good to share Neptune pizza - thin pizzas here but portion is good to share. It was okay, unique. Banana Chocolate Toffee Cake w/ ice cream - sweet goodness Red Sangria - pricey for $8 glass but lovely companion w/ the dinner We'll definitely come back, I have to try the BBQ brisket grilled cheese sandwich (avail until 4pm only). I highly recommend.  We came on a Friday night at 6:30pm, it got crazy busy by 7:30, so we're glad we were fully served! Crowd that came where mostly groups, half were seniors, half were yuppies. Not a quiet place to be on weekends so come early, Sunday or weekday nights. TIPS: Reservations is highly recommended. Families are best to come early. Great place to celebrate or to chill with family or friends."}
{"text":"I had come here for the first time along with a friend as we had both read the positive reviews and were wanting to try it out. The restaurant offers both an indoor and patio dining experience. As it was a very pleasant day, we had decided to dine outdoors. The patio was a nice small area which probably seated around 20 people. I had ordered The Monster burger with a side of sweet potato fries and my friend had the Half Rack & Mac. The fries came with a chipotle aioli dip, as most sweet potato fries do. The service is very good. The host and waitress were very friendly. Also, the food had come out fairly quickly. The fries tasted as most sweet potato fries do, not bad but nothing spectacular. The burger, however, was below expectation. The burger, while tastes good, had really dry patties. However, I would be willing to try this place again, with the exception of another burger."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant.  Out of town on business, found this restaurant on yelp.  Good ratings, so I thought I would try.  I'm glad I did.  Food was incredibly fresh.  Wait staff amazing.  Atmosphere is great.  I would strongly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Pizza tastes good and special. As well as a sashimi something' . Just the side of pizza very hard which is I don't like."}
{"text":"Excellent! Great service, great ambiance and great food. Yep, price on par with Milestones or Kelsey's but much better value. Will certainly be back!  P.S. roasted tomato corn soup is superb!"}
{"text":"The burgers here are massive and required a fork and knife if you want to finish them without making a mess all over yourself. The duck taco makes for a great appetizer as well."}
{"text":"Great hidden little gem of a place! Cozy, relaxing, great food and good prices. This is going to be a regular restaurant for me and if ppl ask for a recommendation for something in that area"}
{"text":"Have always had a great experience here, definitely worth the 5 stars. Even when the restaurant is busy the food comes out on time and is always hot and delicious. Staff are always friendly and helpful even when they are not your specific waiter. Went recently with my husband and the most memorable was the fresh donuts with strawberry sauce, they tasted so fresh and so good. Also had the brocolli tempura as an appetizer and although it seemed like an interesting option to try it was also delish! I will definitely be reccomending this place to friends and family."}
{"text":"Had lobster mac & cheese and ribs there. It was soooo delicious!! The staff was so friendly and the food was amazing! Everytime I am in Toronto I have to go there. The vibe is friendly and it is great for a date, dinner with friends or colleagues and even family."}
{"text":"Never realized theres a restaurant inside this plaza!! Server was really friendly! Food was amazing!   Loved the grilled calamari!! it became my instant favourite!! :) A MUST ORDER if you go!! the toffee chocolate banana cake was good too!!   a very good experience and will def be back!!  *i heard their ribs are amazing too!"}
{"text":"best seafood pizza in town..should try the Smash burger pretty bombb"}
{"text":"Food is very generic. Prices are too high for what they offer. Better to go to pickle barrel or Joey.   However the atmosphere is enjoyable and the service is fast and nice."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times now, the Tacos special was great and the brunch is good here too. Too much syrup on the chicken and waffles though during brunch. But the half rack and mac is great i love their mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"I've been to smash many times now. Smash has an awesome lunch menu as well as brunch menu!   For brunch their French toast and chicken waffle is reaaaaaallly tasty! My favorite! For lunch their pizzas are fantastic too.  The ambiance is nice and cozy, feels like a great family restaurant. Their servers for the most part are friendly and accommodating, but there are the few that aren't so much which is a shame.   The prices are fair for the portions. A large and convenient parking, finding a spot is not an issue.   Overall, the food and service is great. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had the pizza. It was fantastic. We had a private room to watch the game. Great atmosphere. Staff were really friendly but hard to get a hold of."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed here. It's a great place to go with bigger groups, they have a few private rooms and are always very accommodating. The food is amazing, I don't usually leave reviews but felt compelled to with Smash. Can't go wrong with the Monster Burger, Mac and Cheese, Ribs.....really anything. The Burnt Ends are a great way to start the meal and the mini donuts are the best way to end it!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant last month and ordered the Paella. I had high expectations because I had heard a lot of hype about this new restaurant which had just opened up. I can't say that the food lived up to the hype though. Unfortunately, the Paella lacked much flavour. In comparison to the Paella I've tried at Pickel Barrel, I would say Pickel Barrel was much better and in terms of authentic food, Pickel Barrel wouldn't even be on the map (which says a lot)  I also noticed that the portions of the food were good but the seafood and sausage could barely be found. Overall, based on the one dish I tried, I wouldn't recommend this place but if I was forced to eat here for anything business related, it wouldn't be a horrible experience. Perhaps, this was just not one of the popular gems to try at this restaurant."}
{"text":"A bit over-priced for the value received.   The KFB is ok - batter is thick.  Brett's cocktail is nice and fruity.  The calamari was ok, but too sour from the lemon juice.  I'm not a fan of white bread, but grilled ciabatta is all they had. Wish they could carry a whole wheat option/more variety.   Customer service is good: they were friendly and attentive. After our meal we were offered a coupon incentive to return.   Keep an eye on the math on your bill - the total on my bill included a tip, but there was no indication that tip was included. When I spoke to staff, they said it must've been a mistake and  resolved the issue well enough for me to return."}
{"text":"Been to Smash 5 or 6 times in the last couple of years and have never been disappointed. Great variety means that there is something for everyone. Service is good and I really like the atmosphere. The ribs and fried chicken are two of my personal favorites."}
{"text":"Had dinner for the second time last night.  Great service as usual!  I called to book our table cuz with a baby I always prefer to have a spacious table for tons of baby stuff.  The man who picked up my call was very nice, asked if I would come with stroller or car seat only, if stroller, he would arrange a more suitable table for us.  I ordered the ribs and my hubby ordered the steak.  However both were overcooked.  Guess that was the manager who came by and asked \"how's everything?\"  He agreed that the food was over done so he offered to re-cook it, also 2 complimentary salads and 1 dessert as compliment.  The re-cook d food was very nice and even better than lots of chain store ones.  Our first dinner there was nice experience too.  I was too busy with the baby and my pasta was cold afterwards.  I asked if they could hear it for me and they re-did a new one for me.  Very very nice service!!  Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"We went there back in January to celebrate a friend's birthday. The service was good but the food was sub-par. I ordered their special for the day - pan seared scallops on a bed of quinoa, sweet corn and spinach in sweet potato sauce. The quinoa/sweet corn/spinach tasted great but the scallops were incredibly salty. One of my friends asked for a recommendation and was told their BBQ baby back ribs was their best seller so he went with it. What a mistake! The ribs were so burnt half of them weren't even edible! Another friend of mine ordered grilled salmon and it was overcooked and the mushroom linguini was really bland. We also ordered a personal sized BBQ chicken pizza (in lieu of pepperoni and had to pay extra) and there were less than a handful of chicken bits on the entire pizza! There were couple of good dishes though. The Pride of Nova Scotia lobster pizza and beef tenderloin were both good and the Firecracker shrimp appetizer was really yummy but for the price we paid, we were expecting a lot more."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today and had Savor York Region special. It was a group of 4 people. The service was very nice.  It is a bar with a twist. Very nice and interesting menu. We had lobster tacos, they were so delish. The tomato and corn soup was excellent as well. And I was eager to try their famous mini donuts that they make over there. So tasty. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I dined at Smash Kitchen in late November with a party of 7 and 1 child. I had been to this restaurant many times before when it was called something else. Smash was a hit for me. I ordered the lobster macaroni and cheese. Cost around 23 for the dish so I wasn't expecting too much, maybe some ground up lobster and extremely well done seasoning that would fulfill my taste buds but not my stomach... to my surprise I was wrong...  The portion size was excellent and the amount of lobster given was very generous. I counted meat from 3 claws and you are given a half lobster tail while the other half is ground up into the pasta. This was the best mac and cheese I have ever eaten! The apps were also very good and the service was amazing. A complimentary pizza was even brought out for us because of the length of time we waited for our food but to be honest I hadn't noticed.  My only gripe with this restaurant was that I felt it should have been crammed to the gills with customers. It was just busy enough but I hoped there would be a line up out the door because I think this place is one of the best and the value can't be beat! I just hope word-of-mouth will help sustain this place for many years to come because they deserve it."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been trying to find decent brunch places up in Markham as it's a fairly lengthy trek to go to brunch every time in downtown Toronto.    We came here for brunch last weekend after I had a craving for pancakes.  We had been here before for brunch and found that their classic breakfast was a great deal so we decided to come here again to try their pancakes.   We were pretty hungry so we both ordered the classic breakfast and then shared a plate of pancakes.    The classic breakfast is pretty standard - eggs, sausage, potatoes and toast.  We asked for the potatoes to be extra crispy.   The pancakes were actually awful.  I'm 95% certain that they came from a box and were not made from scratch.  The texture was like premixed pancakes and it had the taste of a boxed pancake mix.  Definitely disappointing especially since they were $12!   So truth be told, we liked their classic breakfast enough to come back one more time but after trying their pancakes...I don't think we'll be coming back. I gave this place 2 stars because their classic breakfast is pretty decent but if I had only tried their pancakes, I think they deserve only 1."}
{"text":"Always a good place to hit up if you're looking from some great food! And the staff are all really nice - even bring out some old faves that aren't on the menu if you ask nicely ;) you can't go wrong with the fried chicken or the donuts!"}
{"text":"The staff is brilliant. The level of service I receive here every time is, without fail, incredible. My server, Manny, had us laughing all night and took such good care of us. He went above and beyond to cater to our specific needs and meal modifications. Wish we could have eaten our meal with him haha. A+   The eggplant tacos are a dream! As are the mini doughnuts :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, good service. Like the ambiance and like how it can be romantic at night but still kid friendly during the day."}
{"text":"If you prefer to have a more relaxed dinner, I would suggest going on Sundays. I made the mistake of visiting on a Friday night and having to sit at the bar with 3 drunk idiots across from me.   Asides from that comment, the food was overall pretty good. I really liked the ahi tuna wontons, firecracker shrimp, sundried tomato & spinach dip, pizza, meatloaf, and lobster mac & cheese.   As for the smash burger, at first I thought I enjoyed it but after 2 bites I realized having a burger with 2 thick patties makes it very difficult to eat and the meat was a bit bland.  To the Managers at the restaurant:  1) You should have a host/hostess in front of the restaurant at all times. I have visited this restaurant 3 times and 2/3 times the bartender had to leave their station to greet me and find us a table.  2) There should be at least 2 bartenders on busy nights. I felt bad for the bartender you had on shift Friday night of the patrons at the bar and also make all the drinks for the tables. I noticed that the bartender wasn't able to be attentive as he could have been if he had extra help.  3) Perhaps you should invest in a second POS system to ring in/cash out orders. It really slows service down and makes it awkward for any customer who has to sit next to it like I did."}
{"text":"Had brunch with waifu at Smash. Was pretty good -- we ordered from their brunch menu and she had the classic waffles while I had the garden omelette (see pic).   It was decently sized portions and the cheese in the omelette was at the right level of cheesy and melty and very much enjoyed it.    Here's where they lost a star for me: ------------------------------------- I opted for their prix fix deal which included entree, dessert and coffee for $20. The entrees vary in price from $10-16 and the 3 dessert choices were $7 each so depending what you want as an entree it's not much of a deal. I chose the fresh berries for dessert and was extremely disappointed when it arrived and I saw it was just a dozen blueberries topped with a few chopped up strawberries and a few blackberries topped with some whipped cream -- all in a martini glass. Definitely not worth the $7 they were charging for it."}
{"text":"Overall pretty good food. Got a Poutine, pizza and pasta. All were very good except it was a bit on the salty side. Also we sat outside in the patio and that was super nice"}
{"text":"I've only eaten at this restaurant once with my mother and it was a great experience for both of us. The server was friendly and informative. My mother and I started our dinner with the Firecracker Shrimp and the Calamari. They were both very flavorful and cooked perfectly. Next, for the main course my mother ordered the Salmon and I ordered the Striploin. My steak was very tender, cooked to my liking and seasoned wonderfully. Loved Smash potatoes on the side. My mother's Salmon fish was very moist and also quite delicious. I would definitely recommend going here if you live in the area."}
{"text":"Was introduced to this place by a very good friend....  I was sick and tired of eating Chinese food and needed a change. This place rocked. Great food, great service!"}
{"text":"We were here last night for dinner. A great pick for a restaurant in Markham and very unsuspecting given it's location.   Parking: Lots of it. Free Parking.  Service: - Very friendly staff and very prompt as well.  - Given how busy the restaurant was, the food came quickly too.   Food: - no complaints at all!  - fresh and plentiful - the falafel burger is definitely worth trying out - arrived promptly and was nice and hot (temperature wise), just the way we like it!   Ambiance: - clean - not too crowded - nice lighting  - clean bathrooms!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Smash Kitchen. I've been several times and always have wonderful service, great food and a relaxing atmosphere with friends or my husband. I've never been disappointed with a meal there and I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with the family. It was alright. Wine list has several bottles under $50 which is nice, and they had a $37 prix fixe that was a good deal. The ribs were decent, the salads all nice. Quality is elevated from your usual restaurant in this category - although it is about the same as Milestones. Server sold us on the Anti-Pasti which featured store bought bologna, I'd skip it. Caprese Salad had a strange basil sauce rather than basil, but all my issues are small like that. Nice atmosphere, very attentive waitstaff and they take reservations."}
{"text":"2.5 Stars for Food Visited Smash Kitchen in August during late lunch hours for a quick meal.  The restaurant is very spacious and has lots of nice circular seating booths.    Ordered the Smash Burger, Baby Back Ribs and Neptune pizza.  The burger tasted ok but the ribs were a bit too dry and the meat is lacking favor.  The pizza was the best among all.  However,  it would be nice if the toppings are more generous.    With an average price tag of $20+ per item, I was a bit disappointed and would expected better food quality from Smash Kitchen."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem, its pretty upscale and fancy inside but from the outside you would never know it even existed ( Its located in a random plaza).  We ordered the French toast and eggs benny. Pretty decent. Nice place for brunch. Havent tried anything else here yet but will do another review once I do."}
{"text":"Smh the server didn't give me change I didn't even want to tip that much greedy bunch   Service was bad too did not attend to us   Hire better servers pls"}
{"text":"Do not go to Smash kitchen, I repeat don't go!  This place was beyond inhospitable. I made the mistake of tying them Out for the first time and was turned away by their hostess that said all the tables were reserved....yet there were plenty of empty tables??  And said to wait for an hour or at the bar (we had our young kids with us and there's no way u can seat little kids in a bar stool  safely!). I don't mind waiting at the bar but usually the establishment will at least give a family a table in the bar area and not expect you to seat little kids at a bar stool!!  I mean seriously what kind of thinking is that!  Just plain ignorance. Unfortunately I didn't see a previous tip/review that was posted and made the mistake of taking a chance on Smash kitchen, with no reservations, it was Saturday early evening and the place wasn't packed at all. With that said, the hostess wasn't helpful at all since we had no reservations and said we would have to wait since most their tables are reserved??? Ohwell their lost!  I definitely won't be making a  mistake in ever returning to Smash kitchen and will be sure to spread the word of their horrible hospitality.  Not returning ever."}
{"text":"??lobster mac & cheese, ??????????? ????????????????????? ????????????????????? ????? ?????????????????????????? ???????????????????????? ?????????"}
{"text":"The service was not great, we had a reservation and got there on time but our table wasn't ready, we waited and were told we were being seated at the front of the restaurant  by the bar, 10 minutes later we were seated at the back of the restaurant in a large booth. I sat down and felt something scrape my feet. There was a broken mug under the table! I flagged down our waiter and asked him to move us/ have it cleaned. We waited at least another 10 minutes for someone else to come by and sweep up the broken pieces.   The food definitely turned this experience around. We had the BBQ Ribs and the Buttermilk  Fried Chicken, both were fantastic and the portion size for the ribs was huge!"}
{"text":"Came here three times: Great for a big family & an active baby! Love sitting in the patio when the weather isn't too hot or too cold! There is always seats & welcome environment~ saw a few groups hosting a girls brunch & baby shower~~   Smoke salmon Benedict is my all time favourite & their freshly fried hash brown too!   Only complain is the food was abit salty~~  Would appreciate more if presentation was a little more delicate~"}
{"text":"Mediocre poutine, beer selection is main stream. At least it is something different out in the burbs where most of the places you see are big box restaurants."}
{"text":"It's always a hit or miss at this place. I find the busier they are the tastier the dishes! We had the lobster mac and cheese (AMAZING) and duck tacos were always great! It does get quite busy on Fridays and Saturdays - reservations highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I will describe in reverse order.  The donut  dessert  is their signature  dish comes with mini hot sweet donuts in a wine glass that you will love to eat more.  The paella is one of the tops in Toronto.   Either the taste or the look is good.  The rice a bit cooked like the risotto.  The only missing part is no that many fish in the dish.   There are clams, mussels and lots of pretty good size shrimps.  The seared tuna Wonton is actually a hi.   No complain must try.  The owner is very customer oriented  and mingles with the staff and customers  A hidden gem in the plaza with lots of parking."}
{"text":"I have been here more than a dozen times and have never had a bad meal. The portions are so large that I have also rarely been able to finish a meal!  The Smash Burger is one of the best I have ever had, juicy, fresh and delicious; French fries are yummy; pizzas are unusual flavours, fresh and delicious; pastas are delicious and al dente; chicken, salmon and beef dishes are done to order and service is quite fast and very pleasant.  Ambience is also great and they have separate areas for large parties/ private events.  We have also used their catering service for special occasions. The owner, Jason, works with the chef and the client and is really great about listening to the client and offering suggestions. One thing I found very thoughtful is that they include all the garnished etc for all the appetizers and main dishes so you can make it look restaurant quality even at home."}
{"text":"I dined at Smash with a group of friends last night.   The decor is pretty modern for a restaurant in a strip mall in Markham.  The place reminds me of a Milestones.   The service was okay, but the servers struck me as inexperienced. We had one mess up on the food order after a lengthy conversation about the omission of a certain ingredient, and I was treated rudely when I tried to move out of the way when one of us was served an appetizer.   I ordered the portobello and quinoa salad which was okay.  My husband had the Americano pizza which was good.  Overall, the food was good but not great.   The prices are okay and there's lots of parking.  The plating was modern and well done.  The portion sizes were sufficient. They didn't automatically charge us a gratuity because we were a large group which was a huge plus.   All in all, I would only come back if one of my friends really wanted to eat here."}
{"text":"Just had the crab cake eggs Benedict for brunch. Fantastic quality food and will definitely be coming back for more"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good food, great deals. I had their burger and it was well made.. And huge! The Mac and cheese wasn't that impressive though. They have night deals which make it worth going!  Service is great and they are knowledgeable and very friendly."}
{"text":"Smash is one of my go-to restaurants in Markham. You'd probably find me and my stained purple lips on a Thursday popping bottles of J Lohr. Can't go wrong with half priced wine day!  I can't say their food is out of this world spectacular but it is definitely some good comfort food and probably one of the better choices up in the burbs.   All their pizzas are great and their lobster Mac and cheese is nice and creamy. I do also recommend coming here for brunch. The crab cake benedict is a must!  Service has always been amazing here. When your server is busy, management would come check up on you to see how you're doing or to top you off. Not in a overbearing way but in a hey we care about you kind of way.   Great place to catch up with friends over some tasty zza and wine."}
{"text":"Located in a corner of a small shopping plaza, the restaurant was quite the hidden gem.  I was impressed by the nice interior and the spacious bar area.  Mix between fancy with all the hanging pendants to casual with all the TVs throughout the restaurant.   We were greeted by the friendly hostess and felt welcomed. Servers were also friendly and attentive as they circulated our area.  Came here on Sunday afternoon for a baby shower so everything was preordered by our friend hosting the baby shower.   The area we were in accommodated our large group of about 30 women and a handful of kiddies.   We were offered cocktails and mocktails. Plus food served was well presented and all tasted delicious.  Beef sliders, flat bread pizzas, mushroom bruschetta,  fish wraps, fried chicken, sweet potato fries, pita and cheese dip were placed on a side table as well as centre table buffet style.  I don't usually venture up to the area, but next time I'm nearby, I will definitely try a proper sit-down meal as food and service was pretty amazing."}
{"text":"Great food/atmosphere, although our service was very slow. Our server apologized several times for the wait, and I could literally see him running all over the restaurant trying to serve tables as well as bartend. The other staff seemed to be wandering aimlessly with nothing in their hands and didn't seem to be much help to this poor guy. His hard work made me rate this 4 stars, despite the slow service!"}
{"text":"Well, we came in today. The place was quite busy. We had to wait roughly 15-20min, which was fine. We were sitting tuck away on the left side of establishment.  We came here a while back, it was great. Had my smash burger and I wasn't disappointment. So I came back for a second time and had the meatloaf. It was good and I was full. It was pretty filling. I had a doggy bag for the other portion. It came with hash browns with gravy on top.   My friend had the egg benny with pulled pork (yum) and my mother had the breakfast classic (she was satisfied).  I also upgraded my meal prix fix menu which either came with coffee or tea and one dessert (chocolate mousse, cheesecake, or mix berries) we opt for the cheesecake.  Cheesecake was delicious nice touch with the gooseberry, Caramel and chocolate drizzle on top with whipped cream on the side.  Now, I have no complains about the food. However, the service wasn't the greatest.  First, they forgot the coffee. Second, we received our dessert after another table that order later then us. So we waited quite a while for our cheesecake(15 mins). And I had to remind her about the coffee  At the end, considering there was 3 people in my table I was charge gratuity in my bill for lack lustre service. I was quite disappointed. I thought I wouldn't be charged gratuity when it's below 8 people but I was. Gratuity is earned not given. If service was great I have no issue giving out the appropriate tip or more and I always tip regardless of how bad the service is. It maybe less but I always tip. I had a very disappointing experience and the waitress noticed my face of disappointment afterwards when I left. I sense she purposely added the gratuity in the bill when she knew I was very upset. Completely un-ethical  Not sure I will come back again. The place left a bad taste in my stomach. Fortunately it wasn't the food but it was the service.  RESPONSE: the table only had 3 people. No other. No separate bills, no individual bills."}
{"text":"We meant to try this place since it had opened but hadn't gotten a chance to. We were glad we did! The food was delicious and service friendly and attentive. We went with the whole family with kids and a baby. They were very accommodating and sat us at a roomy booth where I could put the baby car seat. The kids absolutely loved the food! We came here for dinner and would definitely come back to try their brunch menu! If you check in, you get a free app! Great perk!"}
{"text":"I have gone to Smash Kitchen twice, and both times the service was great,  and the food was amazing!   First time was for brunch; which I had the crab cakes Benedict and my boyfriend had the French toast. Both dishes are a must-try! Server was knowledgeable and attentive.   Second time we went to a birthday dinner, and we had a party of 6. The hostess led us to our table and took our jackets since it took a lot of room in the booth. Our server was nice,  attentive and accommodating.  Lamb shank was the favourite at our table. We also had the ahi tuna tacos,  which were probably one of the best appetizers I've ever had, and the Spanish paella had just the right texture and taste. Overall, I would highly recommend this place for brunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"I've been to Smash many times and love it each time. This is one of my \"go-to\" places to meet up with friends and family dinners because the food delicious, the service is amazing, there's always parking and the ambiance is quite nice.  Most recently, I had my birthday there with my family. We were a party of 14 and there was no problem making reservations the day before. Everyone (kids and adults) loved what they ordered.   From the numerous times I've visited Smash, the standout dishes to me are their Surf and Turf burger, their steak, the salmon dish, and the chicken and waffles. I can't wait to return to try new dishes!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant hidden in the corner of the plaza.  Service, food and atmosphere was great. I had the bbq brisket grilled cheese with fries.  The only thing I felt deceiving was the bill that had a \"suggested total with tip\" and the real total.  When it came to paying on the machine, the \"suggested total with tip\" is entered, handed over to you and then it brings you to the typical tip screen, so I can see how people can be tricked to double tip."}
{"text":"Great setting for an intimate and romantic dinner. We went to Smash to celebrate my gf attaining her project management cert.  Seating was prompt and quick on a Tuesday night.  The waitress was patient enough to give us time with the menu . We decided on the ahi tuna wonton app, the smash burger which was a special for the day  and finally the smash pizza.   The ahi tuna wonton app was a good contrast of textures.  Crunch from the fried wonton wrapper and  slaw vs the soft seared tuna.  I found the burger double pattie and bun a bit dry for my taste.  Perhaps the bun could have been buttered and pattie seasoned stronger for a more melt in your mouth gourmet burger. The onions in the burger were battered which was a nice touch.  The coal fired pizza was the best dish of the night.  The thin crust was nice and crispy and the toppings were great.   Since we were short on time we ordered the safer options hoping they would be quick to arrive. Fortunately everything was punctual and we we're able to catch our movie. I look forward to returning to Smash to try some of the other dishes such as the Neptune pizza, lamb shank, steak, ribs and pastas."}
{"text":"Went for brunch today and it was good.  I've heard brunch is the best part of this place so definitely come during that time!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to check out smash kitchen for quite some time, and finally had a chance to for brunch. It was not too busy and we were seated right away.   We ordered a smash burger and chicken and waffles. Food came out pretty quick and looked quite delicious. The chicken and waffles were really good. The chicken was fried just right and the waffle was crispy on the outside yet light on the inside. My bf had the smash burger with the fried egg, but he asked for it over easy which probably wasnt a good idea because once he cut the burger in half the yolk leaked everywhere.   I saw a few people ordering french toast and it looked amazing. Even the regular breakfast looked good and the portion size was huge. I would come back to try that next time!"}
{"text":"Great food but a little stingy on the portions. I enjoyed the lobster Mac and cheese but at the price would expect a bigger portion. I also tried breakfast and had the crab cakes Florentine. Portion was good enough for me and was quite delicious but I personally prefer no paprika on my hollandaise sauce"}
{"text":"Been here for brunch and dinner before. Good food, good service. Decent prices. Definitely need to make reservations 80% of the time because they're just that popular!"}
{"text":"Food: 2.5/5  Service: 4.5/5  Value: 2/5   We came here for the first time on a Friday evening having read so many great reviews on Yelp. There was a 20-minute wait and I am very happy they can take down your name and text you when the table was ready instead of having to wait inside the restaurant. We came back at the 15-minute mark and our table was ready and was seated promptly.   We ordered the the fried calamari, warm steak salad, chicken burger, and a red sangria.  Red sangria - very nicely presented, flavour was excellent. I don't usually drink alcohol but the sangria was done very well, strong but fruity, not watered down at all. I would definitely recommend!  Fried calamari - flavour was great, the spicy jalapeños was a great addition. However, we found the texture of the calamari to be too soft and almost rubbery. It seems as though the calamari was pre-cooked, and the batter was added on later on.  By the time we were half way done the dish the batter has soften and the dishes was not so pleasant. I would skip this one. The bed of salad underneath was very fresh though.  Warm Steak Salad - I wish the salad base was more than just spinach, perhaps a mix of salad green with some hearty veggies (Kale, sweet potato, charred broccoli etc.) would be a good addition. The steak was cook very well and flavourful. A good dinner salad but I was not overly impressed.  Chicken burger - the burger was good but we found the portion size to be on the small size for the price.  Service was excellent overall. The staff was friendly, attentive, warm without being overbearing, a combination which is not easy to come by these days. However, I am disappointed with the quality/quantity and ambience of my experience."}
{"text":"Typical sportd bar feel. Had the monster double patty. A little bit more expensive than I expected. Service was polite but the food could have came faster. Overall, an ok experience."}
{"text":"I came here a few times before but yesterday was my first time coming here for brunch/lunch. Our server was great! They had a prix fix $20 lunch/brunch menu to order from which included a choice of coffee or tea, an entree, and a dessert. I ordered the cobb salad and it was delicious and very large. I almost couldn't finish it and I definitely felt really full afterwards. For drink, I had coffee as I am a coffee drinker and I really needed coffee that morning. It was unlimited coffee which was great! For dessert I was initially going to choose the cheesecake but I saw how big of a slice it was at the table next to us and decided to order the mixed berries with whipped cream instead as I wa already really full. I did not regret my choice - the mixed berries and whipped cream was very light and we a great ending to brunch. I still didn't finish it though. Overall really great experience except for one girl who helped us take photos because our server was busy. She was really rude and didn't even give us heads up as to when she was taking the photo as well she seemed like she hated life at that moment. She walked away afterwards without even asking if the photos came out okay. I definitely gave her the benefit of the doubt and assumed it was because it was busy and she was probably tired. Later on, we asked someone else to help us take photos.   Overall great experience. I would come back. Definitely one of the few good brunch spots in Markham!"}
{"text":"Went to this place for this first time on Saturday and it definitely won't be the last time.  The staff are very kind and are very welcoming.  Our party had ordered some appetizers but a kitchen \"glitch\" had occurred so our waitress (Tanya, who is amazing!) came to us to explain that they will be served with our meals.  She was very apologetic about it and even offered to cover the apps herself.  We were all saying that her sincere apology was enough but for her to offer to cover the apps was just really kind of her.  On top of that, (who I believe was) the Manager also came to our table to apologize.  All this happened early in the night and already we were impressed.    [Beverages] Sangria - Not a big fan of sangria but this one was very very good.  It was actually made instead with pineapple juice which is probably why I liked this one.  If I didn't have the same tolerance for alcohol as a slug, then I would've had my own glass rather than just take sips.    [Starters] Onion Chips - If you like the Blooming Onion at food festivals, you may also like this.  It's a lot lighter and comes with some kind of dip that looked and tasted like chipotle mayo.  I didn't have much only because it wasn't my order, and I tried it much later when it had already cooled down.  I would assume it's much better tasting when it's fresh. 4/5  Ahi Tuna Wontons - Hands down, one of the best apps I've ever tasted.  Not overly flavoured but was flavoured enough.  If you want a lighter meal, I'd recommend this one.  Maybe get another side to go with it. 5/5  [Mains]  BBQ Chicken Pizza - Other than the BBQ Chicken Pizza at CPK (California Pizza Kitchen), this one is very good, maybe even better since the pizzas are baked in a coal fired oven.  Crust is nice and crispy and the kicker or the \"icing on the cake\" with this pizza would be the roasted corn.  5/5  Neptune Pizza - If you love seafood, I highly recommend this pie. It comes with tiger shrimp and smoked salmon. Garnished with fresh arugula, capers that roast nicely and drizzled with a nice balsamic.  It is by far one of the best pies I've ever tasted.  I'd go back just for this pizza. 5+/5  Penne A La Vodka - Big serving of this very simple pasta dish.  Had a pretty good ratio between the pasta itself and the chicken and mushroom.  Had the right amount of cheese as well so it wasn't overly rich. 4/5  BBQ Baby Back Ribs - A great meal for a big meat eater.  Ribs were perfectly prepared as it was quite tender and just fell off the bones.  The sauce was also very nice though it could've used a little more flavouring.  Otherwise, it was still very very good.  5/5  Mushroom Linguini - My friend ordered this dish and she opted out of the bacon so SHE lost some brownie points with me.  The dish on the other hand was very tasty with the right amount of heat.  Definitely something I'd order myself in one of my future visits. 4/5"}
{"text":"Came here with my daughter on a Thursday night a couple of weeks ago. The place was packed and had a great vibe. Service was attentive and the food was great. I gave my 10 year old free reign to order whatever she wanted. We ordered the beef cheek poutine, burnt ends, Caesar salad and the truffle mac & cheese and cleaned our plates. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food aren't bad! Servers are nice. Just a little bit too loud. Oh they have really good pizza. I ordered a pasta that has seafood, the seafood wasn't that fresh/good. Will go there again for sure"}
{"text":"Decent food, good service (if you could get over-served, this is your place!), good atmosphere, busy (which is good), pricey."}
{"text":"Our party of 8 had a great time this evening. The food was awesome, the seafood pizza, lobster carbonara and ribs were all very good. Our server accidentally left out one of the items we ordered but it was quickly fixed. At the end of our time, they offered us their complimentary donut dessert... and it was fantastic! We will definitely be back, thank you for the kind service and great food!"}
{"text":"Overall experience: 6/10 Food: 5/10 Atmosphere: 7/10 Service: 7/10  Going against the grain here and saying that Smash Kitchen is way overhyped. I left underwhelmed and tres annoyed that Yelp had led me astray.   The restaurant is fine in regards to environment and service. Everything is as you expect - nothing is particularly rude (service) or dirty (environment or service lol). It really came to the food that was the major disappointment.  I ordered the lobster mac and cheese. There is 1 piece of lobster - half of a lobster tail that you'll get. Definitely does not feel like your $22 went a long way. The pasta was okay - sauce felt pretty runny though, rather than the thick-gooey goodness you normally are looking for in a mac and cheese.   2 of my friends ordered the margherita pizza, a classic you think you couldn't screw up. Rather than the simple tomato sauce, cheese and basil, both came out topped with whole slices of tomatoes on it. They were not even thinly sliced and pretty cooked (so they seep into the cheese), but looked almost raw.   THE BOTTOM LINE: underwhelming and frankly, disappointing considering the buzz about this place."}
{"text":"Service was great. All the staff are extremely friendly and our waitress was phenomenal. This restaurant definitely knows what great customer service is. They take reservations for large parties. Food was awesome and the environment was excellent."}
{"text":"The food is really good and thats pretty much the only reason i have gone back Although my experience both visits has been pretty much the same.  The hostess, the one person who is responsible for greeting guests and starting off the experience on a pleasant note was absolutely horrible!  So incredibly sassy, so rude, and honestly just did not even want to be there after dealing with her!  I brought over one of my friends to try this place but the hostess was so sassy it was embarrassing for me!  We had requested a booth while I made my reservation online, something the hostess did not acknowledge and then when I asked she said she wouldn't know attempted to move us to another table and then when I mentioned it again she went back and spoke to the waitress and instead the waitress asked us to pick up our menus and took us to a booth. Although it leaves me wondering why I am reserving online if the staff is actually acknowledging via chat but not acknowledging in person. Again the food was so so great but honestly she has made this an ongoing experience and I probably wont be going back and telling anyone who asks that the front staff is super sasssy so be prepared!"}
{"text":"This is a mediocre restaurant with good service.  The downfall of the restaurant really is the food. The staff (reception and dining were all amazing).   I ordered lobster tacos, eggplant taco, vegetarian pizza and chicken bites and fries.   The chicken bites are literally chicken nuggets like the kind u get at mcdonalds served with ketchup and BBQ sauce. ???   The fries were exactly the same type of fries u get at Swiss chalet. Not impressed.   The tacos looked and tasted stale. The lobster was chewy. The pizza had arugula on top that didn't seem washed. Maybe I ordered the wrong things but I always say if you're going to a restaurant everything on the menu should taste good. Unfortunately a miss on every single food item.   Won't return."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Never knew there was food this good in Markham. Went for brunch, had the Chicken & Waffles and my friend had the Smash Burger. He said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had, and my food was hands down the best chicken and waffles I've ever had as well."}
{"text":"It was a tad of a mission to get a table because the restaurant was pretty packed and the hostess seemed preoccupied trying to set tables up for other guests. Had to wait a few minutes before they took my number for a table (they text to you when they're ready).   Overall the service was on point. The service staff was super friendly and attentive. We had the chicken and waffles, which was good for brunch. We found the sauce that came with it questionable, because we weren't sure if we worked well with the chicken/waffle or not... We didn't use much of the ball of butter under the chicken (which is nice to have and aesthetic ! But definitely couldve been something packaged on the side to the same effect)."}
{"text":"The food and service are pretty good, but it's a bit expensive. My husband got the fried chicken and I got salmon, both about $30. For the two of us, one pop, we paid about $80 after tax and tip. It was okay but I'm not in a rush to go back."}
{"text":"The brunch at this place is awesome! It's a three course meal and I got the crab cake Benedict while my boyfriend gets the chicken and waffles. It is honestly a great price, decent service and good food. We have been there for dinner before, but I only prefer to go for brunch because I think it's a better deal."}
{"text":"Great food! I really like their coal-fired oven pizzas, and their pastas are really good. My go-to place when i'm in the area Service was pretty great as well - very lively and genuine"}
{"text":"Awesome service and nice atmosphere. The food was good/ok nothing spectacular. I ordered the chicken and waffles and my wife the crab cakes Benedict. I would eat here again if in the area."}
{"text":"I always look for new places to eat, especially in Markham. Read alot of great reviews about this place and decided to check it out. Looks like they have a nice patio dining at the back of the restaurant but I went during the winter. The service was pretty good and food was okay. I had the burger there and enjoyed the meal. Overall an average restaurant and dining experience."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and ordered off of the fix price menu.  Appetizer, entree and dessert.  For 20$ it's about average.  Had the caesar salad, smash burger, and mini donuts.  Salad was good.  Real bacon, real parmasean, fresh lettuce, just the right amount of dressing.  The smash burger wasn't too smashing.  Average in the burger world.   Fries were similar to New York fries.  Mini donuts were ok.  No party in my mouth or anything.  Had some of my friends cheesecake and the buds were bopping.  Room for improvement though.  It's not very professional for staff to stand staring up at the tv in the dining room floor. lol. Bit awkward.  Other than that, overall a good experience.  Would come back to try other items on the menu"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with a friend. I had the Eggs Florentine and friend had the crab cakes. The eggs were perfectly runny, and so good. I usually don't like potatoes as sides but the hash browns were made so well. We also added an extra waffle, which tasted pretty standard imo, you can probably skip it or just do their waffle or pancake brunch. We got seated right away on a Sunday morning, would definitely come back here again for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here one time and the food tastes amazing. She bought a groupon thing with her with set dishes. When we went on a weekend during lunch time, there weren't that many dining in, restaurant was very quiet.  The staff are very friendly and patient even if we had a Groupon thing.   Their food was fresh and delicious. The plaza is pretty dead, you can definitely find parking here.   I would come back here again for a second time just to try other dishes they have on the menu."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  No sense of customer service what so ever.  I find it so strange that this establishment doesn't spilt separate bills for large parties.  So be ready to pull out your pen and papers and put your high school math to good use to figure out what you are going to pay!  More like they couldn't be bother to satisfy customers.  I would think the manager Brett would have more sense, but we was too busy eating with his friends in another table.  If he told us in a polite way instead of try to blame your customers than it would of been a lesser issue. Im not a yelper but I purposely sign up to comment on this bad experience."}
{"text":"A lovely addition to Markham region, Smash fills a gap of mid-priced, Canadian/Italian type fare in a family-style setting in the area.  Slightly less expensive than the Unionville Main Street area with a much more accessible parking lot dedicated solely to the plaza, the outside of the restaurant looks deceivingly small.  Once inside, it's like Hermione's magic bag:  it has multi rooms, plus a small patio to the left side. Oh, and also a giant silver fork on the wall.  I need that thing in my life.   Came in yesterday with intentions for a super late brunch after checking out their menus online but arrived too late - it was, after all, 3 or 4pm!  (Um, work hard, play hard?)   It was alright though, at such an odd hour we had no trouble getting seats and there were still 4-5 other tables eating too.   My brother had the Smash Burger with an upgrade to some tasty sweet potato fries for an additional $2 or so.  Fact: Fries taste best stolen from siblings.  A boy of few words, he said the burger was \"OK.\"  I think the fries were worth the couple extra bucks.  Can't tell you about the burger as I felt bad about trying to steal a bite off that too.   The hubs and I split the fried chicken and a Smash Lovers pizza.   The chicken, served with a scoop of mashed potatoes, a small bed of charred corn, and a smear of a spicy red oil/sauce on the side. Oh, and also, some gravy. Gravy is always welcome.  There wasn't a lot of it, but it was alright anyway as the buttermilk fried chicken was tender and juicy on the inside, crispy and delicious on the outside.  The hubs felt it tasted like the batter on a calamari, but failed to explain whether that was a positive or negative attribute.    The pizza was on a thin crust, covered in quite a bit of cheese and some pepperoni.  The pizza was fine, but I do feel the price was quite high for the product.  Their pizzas are the same price point as restaurants in the prime downtown areas that *specialize* in pizza - I think it would be more fair to mark these these prices down closer to the $12-13 mark, rather than the $17 going rate.  I prefer the rustic style of a slightly more pillowy (but still thin) dough, slightly less on the crispy side and more quick-fired in the brick oven.  Also, would be great if there was an upgrade option for burrata.  Oh, and D.O.P. tomatoes & sauce would be great too.  Yes, in a past life, I must've been a Ninja Turtle and a pizza snob (mutually exclusive).    Service staff are friendly, no worries if you want to bring children - no short skirts/low shirts gimmicks to draw you in here, just decent food in a clean and comfy spot."}
{"text":"Went for brunch today and overall a subpar experience. Service wasn't great, no refills on coffee. My eggs Benedict was lacking hollandaise sauce and was on the cold side. I am a fan of this restaurant so I'm hoping this is just an aberration."}
{"text":"Must Try: Stone Oven Pizzas, Smash & Monster Burger, Firecracker Shrimp, Chicken & Waffles, the Ribs, Eggs Benedict (Brunch, weekends only)  Rating: (10/10) Food, (10/10) Service, (10/10) Value, (10/10) Ambience, (10/10) Presentation, (10/10) Cleanliness  My Experience:    I rarely ever give five stars, so listen up and believe the hype.   Been going to Smash since it changed over from being Blu Stone Bistro a few years back. From the food quality to atmosphere to the service, everything is always spot on. I've enjoyed a meal there at every time of the day, and I've never found time when Smash waivers in quality.   The food quality is always on point, whether it's for brunch, lunch or dinner.   For Brunch, Smash makes the best eggs anywhere in the GTA. Any egg dish will be a hit, particularly the Eggs Benedict (Crab cake & Florentine are my personal favs). The french toast is also a great choice or even the chicken and waffles!   For lunch, their Firecracker shrimp and Ahi Tuna Wonton's are great starters, and any of the pizza's are great for sharing, Neptune, Nova Scotia and Smash Lovers are my favs. If you're particularly hungry, the Monster Burger (with the onion ring and fried egg) is bragging right to conquer.   For dinner, the BBQ Baby Back Ribs are a must have, but the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Brick chicken are great protein dishes. The lamb shank is spot on as well. For pasta, the Chicken Mushroom gnocchi is great as well as the Lobster Mac & Cheese. If you're lucky and catch the Lobster risotto (usually a daily special) it is amazing, lots of lobster with am amazing risotto.  The staff is always friendly, very knowledgable and accommodating. The manager, Jason, is always upbeat and takes a hand on approach to make sure every customer feels welcomed and at home.   A perk of Smash, is their private rooms. They have two private rooms, and one segregated section   Hands down, one of the best kept secrets of Markham."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice - and ordered the Smash Club both times because I couldn't stop thinking about it. I still can't stop thinking about it. Great atmosphere and the food is definitely high quality without being too expensive."}
{"text":"I get the hype for this restaurant because of its location, but after going here for dinner I found Smash very sub-par. Since there are not many other American style restaurants in Markham, this place is always really busy and you have to make a reservation for dinner.   I rated Smash sub-par because of their mains. The appetizers I found quite tasty and unique. I tried the crab cakes,  ahi tuna wonton and calarmari all of which  were 3/5-4/5 stars. However, when i wanted to try their surf and turf, one of their most popular dishes,and it was sold out which was a bit disappointing. Our table ordered 6 main dishes on their menu and after trying all of them I was very disappointed in the flavors of the food. The presentation was great and overall service was good, no complaints. Just disappointed in the food."}
{"text":"What better way to end a long work week than to treat myself with some delicious creamy baked LA Mac & Cheese with Bacon - Yes, Bacon...mmm... Smash Kitchen & Bar is a cute and trendy gastro pub located uptown in the heart of Unionville, Richmond Hill. Getting a seat was quite the challenge the first couple of times around but we settled for a seat by the bar. They have a wide selection of menu items ranging from Asian fusion to pizza, and pasta. We order the LA Mac & Cheese with Bacon (not sure what makes it LA), Tuna Tartare and Buttermilk Chicken. Food was pretty tasty but I think there's some room for improvement - I was promised crispy golden fries by the server but I found the fries weak and soft, nothing is worse than soggy fries. The Tuna pieces were also too small for each bite and is overpowered by the other flavours in the dish. Great ambiance, and service was friendly and efficient. Overall, it's a cute little place to hang out with some friends if you're lucky enough to get a seat."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch around 11 and had no problem getting a seat. Got myself the crab cake benne and it was delicious! !!! Had the potatoes, veggies and fruits I wanted along with the main dish. They left the coffee decanter and water pitcher at our table so I could refill my heart's desires! They also had a prix fix menu that included the entre, dessert and coffee for $20 if that's your thing.   I'll definitely come back here and try their other menu items! Great for brunch! !!"}
{"text":"First time I've ever had lobster on a pizza, but the combo was quite interesting, not bad!  It's a coal fired oven pizza and the crust was made quite thin and crispy. Would love to try the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"We went on Saturday night for dinner. I found their menu did not have enough variety more burgers. We ordered lobster tacos they were tasty but over priced at 26$. Ordered burger and fries. It was good nothing special.  It had great reviews so we thought we try it out. I would prefer jackastors to this."}
{"text":"I normally only come here during the weeknights for dinner with my friends. We always enjoy meeting at Smash and converse with the pizza and wine special. However I came here for brunch today and was thoroughly disappointed by not just the drinks but also the service which is usually top-notch.   There was a 40 minute wait when we arrived for Sunday brunch which is acceptable considering the nice weather. The host/manager was very friendly and always had a smile on his face even though he had the job of advising people of the long wait.  Once we were seated we ordered the sangria pitcher, our own mains and a waffle to share. The food orders were slower than usual and the waffles came after we finished the mains though we asked for it to come at the same time. The sangria was painfully hard to drink - it tasted like canned pineapple juice with wine. We never even finished the pitcher and hardly drank what the waitress poured for us. I was extremely disappointed that she never even asked how the sangrias were or question why we barely touched our drinks. My friends went on to order different drinks and still she didn't question why. The Caesar only tasted like horseradish and the beer was flat. Yet even though my friends barely touched those drinks either, she never asked or attempted to rectify anything. When she came by to clear plates she would oddly only take one and ask again the next time though we were all done. Food was good which at least saved this visit to Smash.  Overall I've never been so disappointed with this restaurant, especially the service since it has always been stellar."}
{"text":"This spot is a real gem! Driving in and I didn't think that the inside would be as nice and spacious as it was. I went for Girl's night on a Monday, we shared the $10 pizzas. These are thin crust full size pizzas that will make any pie lover go gaga. We had the Pride of Nova Scotia, Neptune and smash lovers pizza. For starters we had Mac and cheese and beef cheek poutine. All the food was really great. favourite is the smash lovers pizza.   The ambiance is great here for a date night or night out with friends. Seating is spaced out enough but still cozy. Service was efficient and friendly. Had a great time, will definitely be back to try some of the other things on the menu if I can resist ordering the pizza."}
{"text":"Don't let the shady plaza fool you, this place is legit! A hidden brunch gem in York region with a great menu and amazing eggs benny. The service was great but it was a little over priced. The pancakes are nice and fluffy but nothing special."}
{"text":"Food is great. Fairly priced and the staff is always excited to see you. Everything you want in a restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered a crab cake benedict for brunch. It tastes good. The menu also offers a wide selection of brunch with coffee and desserts combination."}
{"text":"A hidden gem of a restaurant in Markham with great food and a decent patio.  I've been here a few times and then again when they had the Smash burger deal.    The waitresses are friendly and the restaurant is pretty big and never too crowded.  On a day with great patio weather (though it was a weekday lunch time) we had the patio to ourselves.  Smash has their own Smash blonde beer which is great for a summer day.  The Smash burger was a pretty huge burger - though it did not come with any sides (our waitress was very kind to point that out before the food came in case i had wanted to order something else).  I'd say the food is above average with a great atmosphere where there's usually very little to no wait time.  It's much better than the restaurants down the street on Main Street Unionville."}
{"text":"Seriously the best restaurant I've been to in a while! Went here last night and everything - from the service, appetizers and mains! We trekked from mid-town Toronto to get here and boy, was it worth it!! :)  We weren't really hungry but after looking at the menu, everything looked good. We ended up order crab cakes and pizza to start and then two mains after. TOO MUCH FOOD.   Everything was bomb.com! Especially the crab cakes..divine!   We were also checked up on by the owner/manager? Very nice touch! Server always refilled water and checked up, but not too often.   Ended the night with a food baby! Haha. Definitely recommend!  Oh and the servers are pretty good looking!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. Call and reserve a table tho.  Food: 3/5 Quality control has gone down. Service: 4/5 Super friendly. Kind of rushed us.  Environment: 5/5 Really modern. Comforting.  Washrooms: 4/5 Clean. Worth it?: 4/5 Great for Brunch date.  Came here for brunch. Good thing we made reservations. The wait was up to an hour without one.  The brunch menu looked amazing. They didn't have chicken and waffles however as there waffle machine was broken at the time. The server we had didn't seem very well trained. He was all over the place and had out bills ready and waited near us and just dropped it off while we were only half way done dessert. I was expecting more out of a place like this.   We had the crab cake Benedict and the meat loaf skillet. Both were good but had minor things taking away for it. The hash browns were kind of flavorless and soggy. The meat loaf was dry. I really wanted to like the food. It seemed like the perfect brunch spot.   Others around were commenting about how quality control has gone down hill since they opened and the servers are just not trained to par anymore. I really want to come back and be wowed by this place. It just seems so comforting of a place to me. I will have to try them again and get back to you."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! I came with a couple of friends and we ate in the back patio which was really lovely. Their truffle mac and cheese was soooo good. I can't remember what everyone else got but everyone enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"Made reservations online through open table. Confirmed by restaurant then they cancelled an hour before when enroute. Have booked business and private functions here. No apologies, no explanation so I am a customer lost and will never recommend this venue again."}
{"text":"Monday is the best day to go. For the special, $1 wine corking fee, and $10 any pizza. Try the Neptune pizza, been back 3x with this combo. It's delicious, classy, and a easy of the wallet night out."}

{"text":"This is one of my new favorite restaurants around Toronto.  I came in with a customer on a Thursday night which by lucky chance was 1/2 price wine night on all bottles.  Work was buying but this made my expense report look better.  We decided to just relax with a bottle of wine and keep ordering appetizers until we were full, but it was all so delicious that we just kept eating until we were overstuffed.  I would highly recommend the brisket wraps, tuna wontons, lamb chops and lobster taco.  The prices were very reasonable, I mean the lobster tacos are only $3 each!  The service was also excellent so 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Came by Thursday evening for dinner without any reservations but despite being fully booked, there was high tops and bar seats for those without reservations. The hostess was super friendly and seated us very quickly.  We had two servers that night, Manny and I forgot her name (so sorry!). They were super amazing and patient with us. We couldn't decide on drinks so we ordered food first then we couldn't pick between the wines so Manny brought us samples of a few whites. In the end, my friend settled for a beer and I got an old fashioned (they don't use the large ice cubes so the drink watered down very quickly).  We ordered:  Large Caesar Salad $10 - Romaine hearts, smoked bacon, wonton crisps, parmesan, house caesar dressing. I really like the wonton crisps because it gave the salad more texture.  Chorizo wrapped phyllo dough with jalapeno cheddar dip $? - this is their special they had that night and it was very tasty!  Smash Club $13 - Grilled chicken breast, bacon, lettuce, vine tomatoes, guacamole, chipotle aioli, naan. I did not enjoy this because I found it to be very dry but the flavours are there  Lobster mac n cheese $22 - Lobster rosé, pico de gallo, herb crusted. I would not recommend this because there was barely any lobster in it - I'm not expecting them to use a whole lobster but for that price c'mon! Also, there was a small lobster tail in the mac n cheese but it was frozen tail because when i flipped it over to look at the meat, it has a grey tint to it and it tasted disgusting.  I would come back to try their ahi tuna wonton as I've heard great things about it and because their staff is simply amazing."}
{"text":"Been here for a friend's birthday and we got a private room for 10 people. Had great service but sometimes overlooked since we were in the private room. Went on a Tuesday night and it was their taco night! Apparently they are removing these from the menu and starting a new summer menu. The menu items were good and pretty affordable.  They have specials every day of the week. On Tuesdays they also had pint specials. $4 Canadian pint and $1 off tacos. Tacos were actually not bad so I don't know why they are removing them from the menu. I reallt  I enjoyed the duck taco. Seriiusly reminded me of  a Peking duck because they had hoisin sauce in it with the duck.   My hubby had a tuna salad that looked appetizing.  For my friends birthday they brought in complimentary birthday donut holes with sparklers."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say . Went there for brunch cuz of the good reviews. Ordered the Meat loaf and it taste like gluten + carrots + weird pork. Maybe it's the brunch.  Maybe there dinner is better . Price is ok. However it still didn't worth it. I might give dinner another shot. The staff and customer service is fine"}
{"text":"One of my favourites! It's somewhat hidden in a plaza. On the outside, it doesn't look like much. But once you enter, you get a taste for their ambience and experience. I've been here for both dinner and breakfast, many times. And I'm a huge fan of their food. I recommend going for one of their meat dishes, although you can't go wrong with anything from this place."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch this afternoon. Waited for around 20 min even though there were so many tables empty.   Food was good. I had the meatloaf and my partner had the smash burger with soup instead of fries.   Only 2 stars was because they charged an extra $2 for the smash burger with soup with no extra add-ons. I wasn't aware until long after I left the establishment."}
{"text":"Food was very good, ordered the fried chicken, was very tender and jucy, had some bbq sauce on it, just a hint... with mushroom cream sauce I believe.. was on top of mashed potatoes and grilled corn.  I would have given them a 4 but I did not get the fantastic service others have posted. The server was too busy walking past me and my empty water glass and ice tea to clean tables when people would leave. The only time she stopped to ask me if I needed anything was when she saw my empty plate and came to grab it. Would have been nice is she would have asked 20 minutes earlier, after all, the place was over 1/2 empty.. If u don't want your water or ice tea refilled, and u hate the sight of dirty dishes on tables, this is the place for you! Lol."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place a 2.5.  The service is excellent, everyone from the hosts, waitresses and manager were really warm and friendly.  Really just top notch customer service.  However, the food was just average and bit pricey for the portion size you get.  Came here for dinner and had the Mushroom gonnochi, sweat potatoes fries were rather bland."}
{"text":"This was our first time here, came for brunch. Amazing service, very good food and presentation, fantastic atmosphere, very relaxing. I can say this is the best place I have been in the Markham area, will be back often, what a gem."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch today! Made reservation 30 mins before arriving. I love the opentable that feature!   Decor - its nice, I think in the nights it would be pretty cool when the lights are on.  Service- the waiter was friendly, attentive and prompt with our requests.  Food- good. I enjoyed the crab cake Benedict. The crab cake was meaty a s tastey. The egg was soft and runny, which I like. The hollandaise didn't have much taste. I didn't notice it amongst the crab cake. The hash browns were bland. Dave got the chicken and waffles. The chicken was crispy.  But the dish was overall bland and didn't compared to other places we've tried.  The bill came to $51 with the yelp check in discount including tax and tip. Its a good value for the meal.  I will be back to try the dinner and drinks menu in the summer."}
{"text":"Many months back a fellow Yelp GTA Elite recommended that I check out this spot because they were doing some big things in the in their \"Kitchen & Bar\" that were worth noting!  I'd visited several times for a beer when doing work, but somehow had always 'just' eaten before arriving (talk about poor planning on my behalf). However, that beer was almost always their own custom brew of Amsterdam beer aptly named the \"Smash Blonde.\" It's a cool crisp flavour perfect for the summer.  Speaking of summer, despite this place being a tad hard to find, they've got the perfect patio/deck outback that is just begging for you to have drinks on now that the weather is warmer. And if a \"Smashing\" beer isn't your bag, the bar here is one of the few in the GTA to actually be whipping up Craft Cocktails!!  That's right folks, SMASH does Craft Cocktails!!! Standouts include their Smash Caesar (made with a delicious spicy green bean garnish) and my personal fave the Peach Whiskey Smash (made with simple syrup, real muddled peach and makers mark Bourbon). No matter what the cocktail it's served in a mason jar, filled with ice and let's be honest... they're FAN-Friggen-tastic!!  Bar aside, the kitchen has got it going on as well, known for their Smash Burgers, Pizza and Donuts, I haven't had the chance to try any of the three (which I look to remedy ASAP), HOWEVER, what I have recently eaten was a appetizer platter of their fried calamari AND their burger slider appetizer. Likely one of the best fried calamari's I've ever had and the special sauce on the burgers was unreal!   What I like best about Smash is it's versatility. The staff are professional and knowledgeable like that of a fine dining establishment (which matches the decor, accented with high wrap around booths - very private and intimate), however with the multitude of television screens, excellent patio and casual fare make this a great spot to stop in with your friends for a game or just to grab drinks and apps like my friends and I did!  There are many, MANY menu items I need to try both in \"Kitchen & Bar\" so it would appear this will be a new regular spot for me this summer when in Markham. Join me if awesome eats and thirst quenching drinks are your style!  EatCrest Out!"}
{"text":"The ribs here are something I dream about weekly - since I ate them for the first time at Unionville Main St Festival last summer - thank goodness the restaurant is within walking distance - I've begged and begged for the recipe but the chef ( understandably !!!!) won't give it to me :(           Update on April 3 - I came here for the 5th time today w a girlfriend for lunch and - as usual- the place was packed a delicious. Smash is starting to lead a charge towards being my FAVOURITE Unionville restaurant - I just wish it was within walking distance like Unionville Main St restaurants - however since the awesome bike lanes in our neighbourhood were expanded, it is BIKABLE therefore that will be a possibility ...... If Spring ever arrives !!!!! I had the Cobb salad and it was perfect - our amazing waiter was perfect and polite and very patient despite the fact that we had so much to chat about ..... 97 minute lunch..... He must have refilled our water glasses 20 x. So nice :) Thanks Smash !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and service and seating... Tuna wontons were great, salmon salad, monster burger and seafood salad were all delicious"}
{"text":"Came here a few times before and it has never disappointed me. Food is always good, I love their pizzas (my favourite is Neptune). I tried their pastas and Mac and cheese before and liked those too. Service is always super prompt and friendly as well. Will definitely keep returning  ( $10 pizza deal on Mondays is an amazing deal!)"}
{"text":"Food 3/5 (50% of final grade) Nothing mind-blowingly delicious for both appetizer, entree, and snack. The only thing that caught my attention was the banana chocolate cake. It was a nice harmony of moist, rich, and everything good-- so I gave it a three.  Ambiance 3.5/5 (15% of final grade) The place was darkened to fit its description being an \"upscale casual\" place of dining. Aka, bring a date here and it should be ok, if you don't mind the discrete entrance that is. The entrance looks ghetto (lol), but the inside space looks nice :). I liked how they maintained a casual air while having black lap-cloths neatly folded with cutlery placed delicately on top. They have a room that fits roughly twenty people, so you could hold special events here, too. The establishment had a clean feel to it in general-- no sticky menus or mysterious stains on chairs or tables, which is to be expected.   Service 3.5/5 (15% of final grade) The staff did really well with ordering and catering to the big group I went with (about 20 people). They promptly took our orders, the food came quickly, and the server helping us out was happily and eagerly asking us what we thought of the food (this was what garnered them extra points, the genuine feeling they emitted of wanting to know what we thought of the food). From my memory, all the servers were happy to serve!  Cost 2/5 (10% of final grade) It's priced slightly high for comfort food (so a little higher than places like Kelsey's, for your reference).  Brownie Points 0/5 (10% of final grade) Although the experience was nice, nothing they did left any particular impression, so no brownie points awarded.  Final Grade = 55/100 = 3 Stars  TLDR: A nice establishment, but not a place I would prioritize revisiting or crave food from. MAYBE come here for a date IF YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEAS. Then again, if you are on a date, I guess the main highlight is your date and not the food ;) Think of this place as Cora on classy steroids."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday after hearing so many good things about this place and reading so many good reviews. Ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict and my boyfriend ordered the Smash burger with the prix fixe ($20 for entree, coffee or tea and dessert). He got coffee and the chocolate mousse. The eggs benedict was tasty but not mind blowingly amazing. I enjoyed the smash burger a lot more. Would order that next time! The chocolate mousse was alright, wish it was a little lighter. Overall, had a good brunch and would come back!"}
{"text":"Turns out this is a really good location in the 'burbs for group events. There are private rooms and plenty of large tables available. Way busier than I expected, food and mixed drinks all still came out at a decent wait. The FIRECRACKER SHRIMP CAESAR comes with a massive piece of fried shrimp, the burgers will defeat you with messiness if you dont show em who's boss, and the pizza comes on a thin thin crust, softer towards the middle of my lobster pizza but crisp towards the edges. The PRIDE OF NOVA SCOTIA coal-fired lobster pizza was not mind blowing, but tasty -- especially considering roasted garlic candy topped it off and there were actual discernable bits of lobster. The lobster in the SURF AND TURF BURGER, however, was highly negligible."}
{"text":"After reading the stellar reviews for this restaurant, and having contemplated many times on going, but upon second contemplation, never actually having went, I decided to finally head to this east-GTA gem. I thought this was going to be a surefire hit given all the stars this place has racked up...right??   But alas fellow yelpers, I think you've gone a little over your head with this one.   Here's the scorecard:  Ambience: 3.8/5 - Yes the 0.2 points from a 4 count. The resto/bar offers a pretty standard ambience akin to other chains like Milestones, Scaddabush and Joeys. I felt it was a bit of a cross between family dining and a lounge setting. The central bar offered the typical loungey oasis that cater to executives and tired 9 to 5'er's. While surrounding the bar spanned family style dining furniture that felt more reminiscent of a Jack Astor's or Montanas. Just kind of a discord in design IMO. So naturally I felt a bit disjointed upon entering. Is it ok to shoot one back here? Or do I have to worry about the kiddies?  The main event: 3/5 - We ordered the two most popular items according to our very jolly waitress. All critique aside, she was attentive and very pleasant, so cheers to providing good service Smash.  Let's start with the pizza, the Poseidon. It wasn't half bad. There were some good chunks of shrimp and lobster on there..so points for that. It was a thin crust and the flavor was savoury but not too overwhelming, as seafood can sometimes be. The second entree, the infamous Lobster Mac-N'Cheese was good but not spectacular. There were about 3 large chunks of lobster meat, but after having gobbled those, I wasn't really gung-ho in finishing the rest. Let's just say, I've had better.  Last thoughts: Would the food have been more of a hit in their Unionville location?"}
{"text":"You could never tell from looking at the outside but this restaurant is warm and inviting inside, the food is really good, and service friendly"}
{"text":"Nice service with ample of space. The portion size is decent, though the soup I feel is a bit too oily. There is no real complain other than it not being at the most obvious (location-wise) place in the plaza.  Smash Kitchen is still one of the top spot for comfort Canadian food in the Unionville area."}
{"text":"Passable...coffee pot was always empty, the waiters were unavailable and inattentive.  The chicken and waffles was OK.  The waffle was fine because almost no one can get that wrong.  The chicken was obviously not fried recently because it was hard and crusty. And not that warm.  The sause that made all it kind of edible was sparse.  So meh...passable."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to visit this place but we were in dinner menu so no Chicken waffle *cries* Got the Southern fried chciken sandwich which was pretty good as well.  Service was amazing as thre waiter kept checking on us and even refilling our water when he saw the glasses were gettign empty. Food quality is very high and flavor is amazing.  Will want to come back for lunch next time."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend (who is an extremely picky eater) to Smash for the first time on Sunday. We decided to try various items from the menu - Firecracker Shrimp, Garlic Cheese Bread, Ribs and Chicken, L.A. Mac & Cheese and the Seafood Paella. Food came hot and within the time frame we were given.  Firecracker Shrimp - A little overdone in my opinion - bacon was break off crispy, whereas I like a little chew. I personally like spicy food, so was expecting more kick. Overall still good.  Garlic Cheese Bread - Delicious when hot out of the oven. We asked for the balsamic on the side, but when combined together with the bread and fresh tomatoes, was great and refreshing.  Ribs and Chicken - Boyfriend greatly enjoyed the chicken. Well seasoned and not too much batter. Ribs well sauced.   L.A. Mac & Cheese - Absolutely amazing! So amazing we went back on Monday and had take-out of it on Tuesday as well. Super cheesy, just how I like it.  Seafood Paella - Initially I thought the portion size was quite small, but in the end could not even finish it. Well flavoured. Ample mussels and prawns with some pieces of sausage.   On top of the great food, service was great a well. We were informed off the bat the kitchen is just in the middle of transitioning from brunch, therefore the food may take longer to come out. The manager came to us to apologize as the kitchen just transitioned, the mashed potatoes was not ready at the time and offered to substitute the side. Water was always available at the table. and all staff were friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Was here for a retirement party a few weeks ago and food and service were fantastic!!  Came back for brunch with some friends and the chicken and waffles did not disappoint - probably the best I've had!  The chicken was hot and skin crispy and waffles were not soggy as I've experienced in other places.  Finally, some good eats in Markham!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and the food was pretty good. Like that its a bar but feels more upscale. A nice place to go with family or for an event such as a birthday. They have a wide range of food to pick from as well that is nice. Would definitely go again"}
{"text":"Will definitely be coming again.  It's a bit hidden and tucked away in a plaza. Did not expect such a nice atmosphere inside !  They have great daily food specials, as well as drink deals.  Server was fantastic and the food tasted amazing. We went hoping for brunch, but they only have their bunch menu on weekends. However, the sandwiches we ordered were delicious.  This place also has multiple party rooms, or is great for small groups."}
{"text":"Dinner did not fail to impress. I had the Seafood paella, and the way they cooked the rice made it absolutely fabulous and tasty. Portion-wise, it was adequate for me, but perhaps may be small for others. My friends had the lamb shank, lobster Mac and cheese, and all of them were satisfied (especially my friend who had the lamb shank, who is in chef school). Server was attentative and pleasant. Don't forget to make your reservation for dinner, especially on weekend.  Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Occasion: birthday party dinner for a party of 15 or so.  Location/Service: It's located between Kennedy & Birchmount of Hwy 7 - inside in the corner spot of the plaza.  The restaurant is very big with bar tables and patio available.  Service was very good as there were multiple staff handling the big party.  Food: Surf & Turf - this is the only thing I tried on their dinner menu. It's a combo of jerk pork belly and grilled octopus.  I really liked the octopus as it was grilled to the right level and still chewy.  The pork belly was a little overcooked and became a bit dry to my tasting.  The parsnip puree and beet gastrique helped balanced it out, but it would have been a little better.  I have come here for brunch and I think it's worth to try.  Their eggs benedict is done very well and there's a variety of styles to choose from.  I would come back again to try their dinner menu, hopefully editing my review with a higher rating!"}
{"text":"Finally made it to this restaurant located where the Bluestone Bistro used to be on Highway 7 and I wasn't disappointed. The menu has a pretty extensive range of contemporary comfort food from ribs and burgers to pasta and pizza. The BBQ baby back ribs I ordered for my main were impressive both in presentation (check out the photo! Rib tower. Lol) and in terms or taste. They were sweet and fall off the bone tender. Almost as good as some rib festival ribs I've had. Only really lacking in the sauce department a bit because I prefer mine a little more kick. There was also A LOT of meat on them. They were pretty substantial. On the side were some delicious mildly spicy smashed (haha) potatoes and some really good corn. Delicious. My dinner companion also reported her food was tasty (salmon and risotto dish) too...when she wasn't trying to steal some of mine. The drinks menu was pretty good too and the Smash Blonde beer looks like a reason to come back and try out the pretty awesome looking deck/patio in the summer.  It's a little on the higher end though (~20-40 per person), so be aware of that. I'll definitely make my way back here again in the summer--if not sooner."}
{"text":"Very modern and well maintained restaurant. I went on a busy Saturday night with no reservation and waited approximately 20 minutes. The staff were friendly and professional and were attentive to our table. Our food came promptly, less than 15 minutes wait  We had ordered the smash burger and mac and cheese, which were both delicious. There were lots of flavor and layers to both dishes, and I recommend both. I had also gotten the eggplant taco. It was good, but too simple and would rather skip it next time.   Overall, this restaurant was a perfect destination for a chill Saturday night."}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  We didn't reserve seats and were told that the last patio seats were given to the customers before us. We asked to wait and they told us we could. The seats were ready quite quickly.   1. Appetizers: The firecracker shrimp, duck and lobster tacos for appetizers 2. Soup of the day: Cream of mushroom 3. Entrees: Lamb Duo, K-BBQ Octopus (from the Specials menu) 4. Desserts: Apple Smash 2.0, Chocolate Banana Toffee Cake  The firecracker shrimp is bacon wrapped shrimp. It was very meaty and not too salty. The lobster taco had jalepeno inside to bring a nice kick to it. With the lemon juice, it was very refreshing. The duck taco however was not spectacular. It reminded me of the wrapped Chinese Peking duck with cucumbers and hoisin sauce.  The food overall, was very well plated and the flavours were on point. The lamb was very soft and the parsnip puree paired very well with the heavier meats. It was earthy and sweet. I enjoyed it - having the texture similar to mashed potatoes but not as heavy.  The main highlight of the K-BBQ Octopus was the tenderness and softness of the meat. It was grilled to perfection, with the suckers chewy but not too hard. The kimchi and pickled cucumbers were sour but it wasn't overdone as the brussel sprouts balanced it out.  The Apple Smash 2.0 was ridiculous! As one of the staff would say. It was warm with apple filling, and had a scoop of maple pecan ice cream as well as cinnamon crumble. The banana Chocolate Toffee Cake was also delicious. It had a good mix of the textures.   1. Red Sangria: It had blueberries, strawberries, and blackberries. It was not too heavy and was infused well.  2. Lychee martini: It was interesting. There was a fresh lychee at the bottom and the martini was sweet.  3. Just Peachy: This is not your typical peach flavoured drink. The appearance looked very different. I was confused if I was given the wrong drink. The rim with coated with red sugar and a piece of strawberry. It didn't taste like peach, and was slightly too sweet.   I was very pleased with the courtesy of the staff and their exceptional customer service. There was also a lot of thought put into the plating and menu items."}
{"text":"Yum! Smash brothers is one of those restaurants that once you find you want to keep going back.   Just off of Hwy 7 in the midst of construction that has taken the city (what feels like) 15 years to finish, sit this small restaurant hidden away.   Their brunch is amazing, so good that I went back the next day for their dinner menu and grabbed their famous smash burger.   Brunch: I had the crab cake eggs Benedict, it was very very good. The crab cake was not greasy at all and the poached egg was cooked to perfection, the yolk was gooey and warm. Yum. My husband got the chicken and waffles, this is the best thing since sliced bread. The chicken is breaded and deep fried, and super moist on the inside. The waffle, fluffy and warm. I highly recommend ordering any of those.   Dinner: my friends and I all got the smash burger, it came with a double patty, an onion ring and fresh toppings. It was wicked, but the best thing on that plate was the roasted red pepper Parmesan. If you haven't had their homemade soups, you have to try it. It was to die for!   Overall, come brunch or dinner - this place is amazing. Stop by today!"}
{"text":"For dinner, I settled with the duck taco, $5, and veggie lovers sandwich, $12.   Service at this place is definitely a 5, and that's maybe because I came fairly late - last call was in an hour so it died down by then, but I'm basing it on the flavour of the dishes itself.   The duck taco was a hit with me, something I'd like to try again. The veggie lovers sandwich lacked any flavour. It's dishes such as this one that give vegetarian options a bad rep considering it was missing any real taste. The bun was a little dry - could not taste any basil pesto, and needs more of a kick/spice.  Truthfully, I would like to come back, but this time try their brunch menu and maybe the lobster taco, $6. The only other thing was, at dinner, my guest complained of it being too dimly lit that they had trouble reading the menu."}
{"text":"Went here for a weekend brunch with friends. My friends had variations of omelettes, eggs Benedict. I had the crab cakes Benedict which was quite good. We all had the deal to get some coffee with our meals. Friendly waitresses who accommodated with a smile to small changes and picky eaters.  Nice ambience.  Would I come here again? YES. Especially to try the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Came here today at 11:20am     I was the first customer of the day, and i was served to a table as soon as i walked in. The service was pretty decent but there were times where there was no waiters/waitresses insight but probably because they are still prepping for the day.  They offered a complimentary coffee to start us off.  I ordered ahi tuna wontons that tasted ok- it wasn't anything spectacular actually tasted a little off.  Also ordered smash burger that tasted pretty good better than the usual burgers you get from fast food restaurants. The size was pretty big too.  Overall- food is decent Service - it's ok ~maybe better later in the evening"}
{"text":"When you walk into the restaurant, it looked like a big bar. But then I saw the seats. Apparently, there is an outdoor patio - which is awesome because it's situated behind the restaurant and not in front of the parking lot.   My friends and I ordered the Smash Burger, Meat Loaf skillet, Eggs benedict, Omelette, Fruit with whipped cream, NY cheesecake. I got the Smash Burger, and it was quite good. I believe we all got the sets, so mines also came with dessert - which I ordered Fruit with Whipped Cream. I tried some of my friends cheesecake and it taste like any other cheesecake. My own dessert was also an expected taste - but I was going to travel in the afternoon. So, I didn't want to be too full.  The service was wonderful though. Our waittress was really quick to respond to our needs. The food came out a little slow, but we weren't rushing. Overall, I'd definitely come back to try some of their other foods."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for a nice dinner but it came out to be an unpleasant experience. We asked if his salmon had peanuts or any nuts in it and the server said no. Once it was served and he ate it, he immediately suffered an allergic reaction.  The manager came over and the best thing he could do was refund only his meal back while I had to pay for mine, without being incredibly apologetic for almost putting my boyfriend into an anaphylactic shock. Thanks for ruining our dining experience. Never returning."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to return to this restaurant ever since attending the excellent Yelp event that was hosted here in May. Because the pizza was so great at that event, I went with the BBQ chicken pizza (tomato bbq sauce, mozzarella, roasted corn, red onions and cashews), and it was phenomenal. Corn and cashews on pizza is a great idea! Who knew?  For dessert we had the banana chocolate toffee cake, and it was also great. Large portion sizes as well.  In terms of drinks, this seems to be the kind of place that focuses on wine and cocktails. That being said, in the future it would be great if they could also add more to their beer list. What's on tap is great, but this is quite a large restaurant and there were a fair number of people drinking at the bar, so it could probably support a few more brands.  The service was also quite good.  This is a restaurant that you could easily miss -- it's tucked into the back of a plaza with no frontage -- but there was a decent crowd for a Wednesday, so I hope this place is here to stay. The space itself has really high ceilings and tasteful modern decor. I like that its something big and modern, which is different than the smaller restaurants in old heritage homes on nearby Main Street Unionville. It's nice to have some variety.  They have AYCE ribs on Wednesdays. I wasn't hungry enough for this at the time, but I plan to return to check it out."}
{"text":"Decided to come back for brunch with a bunch of my girlfriends around 12pm for a table of 6. We all had a hard time deciding what to get as so many items on the brunch menu were appealing.  I decided to go with the Smash Benedict. This was on the heavier side but I actually quite enjoyed it. The only thing I would want to mention is that the potatoes that it came with were slightly salty.  Overall another enjoyable experience! Good portions for the prices that they're listed at."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday. The grilled cheese brisket salad was tasty, but the Smash burger was disappointingly small and nothing special about it....unless you pay extra for more ingredients like fried egg. The Greek pizza was a little on the dry side but good nonetheless and great for sharing. Staff was welcoming and friendly. Would come back again to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The location is bit hidden. However, once you step in,  the place looks amazing. The ambiance is very nice. Our waiter was very friendly and helped us with our choices. As for appetizers, I did enjoy their sweet potato fries and fried wontons. For my main, I had the lamb shank.  The presentation was great but the meat was a bit dry.  The other mains our table got was the buttermilk chicken (good), angry lobster (too spicy), and the mac and cheese (good). For the dessert, their mini strawberry donuts were great. They do have a wide selection of drinks on the menu as well. I would have given them a 4 star but we didn't have an easy time paying for the bill. They accidentally charged extra things on the bill which was settled and they apologized but then they didn't take pre-paid visa gift cards. Would I go back?  I would but this time I'll probably try their pizza and other methods of payment."}
{"text":"The SMASH burger is indeed amazing!    My friends and I went there for dinner on a weekend.  We made reservation at 6, which was not super busy when we arrived. It started to get more packed after 7, but I think if you are coming with a group of 4 or less,  it shouldn't be too hard to grab a table without reservation.   The SMASH burger comes with 2 juicy and beefy patties and some crispy onion rings (inside the burger) and a side (choice of soup,  salad,  or fries). I highly recommend getting the fries as they are slightly thick-cut and freshly deep fried. The portion for fries is also larger than salad or soup. My friend and I both got the SMASH burger and shared the sides - one order of salad and one order of fries,  but we still couldn't finish the fries.  The fries are more than enough to keep you satisfied and full.   The service was alright.  One of the servers seemed to be in a hurry and always wanted to take our dishes away.  Other than that,  the overall experience was great."}
{"text":"Have not been here for a month, the price increased 20 - 30% compared to last visit. Brunch food quality and service did not justify the price. Too bad, we would rather go to 'Inspire' or ' Alchemy', weigh better food and price."}
{"text":"Went here with my family on a weeknight and it wasn't busy so we were seated pretty fast. There were a lot of things to choose from on the menu but I decided to get the beef brisket grilled cheese with side salad and my mom got the smash burger with side soup. Service was good, and the food portions were a decent size and pretty filling. I really enjoyed my food and so did my mom, we were pleased by how good it tasted! Def recommend this spot to try and would also come back!"}
{"text":"-- My First Impression --   This was my second time eating at Smash Kitchen. The first time experience was terrific. We were there to host a surprise birthday party for my husband. I called Smash 4-5 times to change the guests count and made arrangements to drop off the birthday cake. The manager and the hostess were very helpful. They even arranged a private room for our party without any additional charge. The food and service was awesome! I was hoping to come back after that birthday celebration. When I noticed there was an \"Order-the-yelp\" event at Smash this year, I was super excited and decided to order their takeout! I called them 15 minutes ahead of time to place my order for the takeout, and I picked up everything on time.   -- Food and Drink --  *** We only ordered food from the \"Order-the-yelp\" menu***  1. Main: Finger Licking Rack (Full rack of ribs) - Smash bbq sauce, smashed potatoes, chipotle lime roasted corn) $14  - The ribs was super tender and the meat just fell off the bone! We loved their barbeque marinate. They used fresh corn instead of frozen corns. Their mash potato was quite bland, I think I should have tried their potato first because the barbeque taste was too strong and overpowered the taste of the rest of the dish. Overall, I enjoyed their ribs a lot!   2. Burger:  Yelp's Angry Smash Burger (Burger) - Double patty, cheddar cheese, onion chips, lettuce, pickles, smash sauce $7.50 - The burger was huge! I couldn't bite the burger in one bite. :( Love the quantity and quality. It also came with a side (salad/ fries/ daily soup). We picked the soup of the day, which was the Southern Pulled Pork Soup. The soup was very hearty. It had a strong spicy, sour and sweet taste. There were a lot of pull pork in the soup, and again they used fresh corn in the soup! I couldn't be more pleased to try their soup and burger :)  -- Overall --  I loved Smash Kitchen! The food was great (4.5/5.0) and their service was exceptional! Can't wait to come back to try their brunch! :)"}
{"text":"I've been to Smash a few times in the past and based off my experiences I can safely say this restaurant is a strong 4/5. Make a reservation if you're going for a weekend dinner, it gets very busy and most of the time, there are large groups in there having parties so space is limited.  Smash has a pretty diverse menu which I find is not too small or not too large. There are enough options where you feel like you have a few different things to choose from yet you're not overwhelmed. Some of my favourite dishes included the Korean Fried Broccoli, the Tomato Corn Soup and the Mushroom Linguine! For most of their dishes, the portions are quite large so you're getting good value for money.  My favourite part about Smash would have to be the atmosphere. It has a very cool vibe without being overly intimidating or unapproachable. You can come here with your family, your friends or anyone else in between knowing that there's going to be something for everyone."}
{"text":"their food is really good and the service is absolutely amazing. I had the same server the few times i went and unfortunaltey i never got his name but he was incredibly helpful and very good attitude, he wasn't fake or anything like that. I come with my parents all the time for early dinners"}
{"text":"Have visited Smash on two occasions. Both times the food and service was good!"}
{"text":"Come here with friends periodically whenever we are craving some brunch, however even though the service was great the food has become average.   I ordered the crab cake Benedict and the crab cakes were nicely prepared but the hollandaise sauce on top of it was a disappointment. It was not a hollandaise sauce, it tasted more like a runny chipotle mayo sauce and overpowered the flavours of the crab cake. Friend ordered the eggs Benedict Florentine and also had the same \"hollandaise\" sauce on her dish, which she did not like either. Although ample of Smash hash browns were provided the meal felt way too heavy afterwards as I couldn't finish off the hash browns. Instead of providing 2 meager pieces of fruits, a salad would be better. Will be going back to the other brunch place  two doors down, since their brunch comes with home fries and also an arugula salad."}
{"text":"It was almost worth a 5 star the first time I came but I don't believe there is perfection. It hovers between a 4-4.5 star and reason being is the place can get really busy on weekends so you have to make reservations and although they seemed to be known for their fried chicken, I was not that impressed. Also, one of our servers did not seem to attentive.  I came here for both their brunch and dinner menu. It's a nice place for both brunch and dinner doesn't get too noisy and has decent options for food. They also have TVs playing sports so it's always nice being able to catch a hockey/basketball/baseball game. Portions are also quite big.   What I tried - crab cakes Benedict, buttermilk fried chicken, BBQ Beef Brisket Grilled Cheese and ribs.   Crab cakes Benedict - this is my favourite here! I have tried bits of the other Benedict's, their meat loaf and chicken/waffles from my friends but will still always choose this for brunch. I just love their crab cakes so much. I would just go here for brunch because I want to eat this dish.  Buttermilk Fried Chicken - the chicken was not a winner for me. It was only ok, I expected it to wow me and it didn't. The portion is decent and it comes with a side. I chose truffle Mac&cheese and that was the star. Their Mac and cheese is so good. It's heavy but I love it. The side is a perfect portion and a great way to get a taste of it.  BBQ Beef Brisket Grilled Cheese - delicious! I opted for soup instead of fries. Their special that day was stracciatella! When it came, the soup looked underwhelming because it looks just like chicken broth with some white stuff in it (for lack of better description) but the flavours were so on point. It was very flavourful and did not taste bland at all. I was so pleased. The sandwich did not disappoint either. Very thick and the beef was flavourful - the fried onions added a lot of flavour. The slaw inside the sandwich helped to balance out the grease and heaviness from the fried onions and grilled cheese. I was only able to finish half the sandwich but it was delicious.   Ribs - it's a hit or miss. When it comes warm without too much sauce smothered on it then it's great. My friend got the ayce ribs and wasn't too impressed. It came cold a few times and too much sauce smothered over it. Also, just waiting to get the ribs in between took awhile.  I still want to try their burgers and pizza. I would also come back for more Mac and cheese.  Service - usually it's great but we had a mediocre experience once. The server kept coming back a bit too often at the beginning to see if we were ready to order. My friend and I were a bit distracted with chatting about basketball so I felt interrupted. Eventually during the night when we needed the server to come, it was hard to get their attention. It was a bit of a let down because it seemed that the server would always come at the wrong times (interrupted us again while we were intensively watching the basketball game and talking about it). I'm hoping this is a one off situation. Despite this, I still think smash is a great place to come."}
{"text":"I Tried this place after craving for chicken waffles. They only serve it for weekend brunch so we made sure to book some time for it during the past weekend.   We did the price fix brunch that came with coffee and dessert along with the entree. We both ordered chicken waffles for the entree, of course.   The waffles had a nice light syrup. The chicken was done perfectly and was delicious.   The portions were huge and since we don't have huge appetites for lunch, we could have easily shared one order of the chicken waffles.   The coffee and ice cream dessert was good. I tried the cheesecake and it was alright, but I was never a fan of cheesecake anyway.   The server was nice and we were seated right away. Nice casual atmosphere  Overall, this was a good brunch and we will be back again."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here. The first time was just for drinks and the sangria was really good. Today I came for lunch and it was ok. By checking in you get a free appetizer with the purchase of two entrées. We got the mac and cheese which was the highlight. It was perfectly creamy and gooey. I wish this was my entrée. I got the mushroom linguine with pesto cream sauce. It wasn't bad but a little too saucey and salty. And the peas don't do much for it. I ate what I could but didn't care to pack any home. Our server was friendly. To pay with a machine you need to go to the bar. I'd come back for the mac and cheese but not in a rush."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a late lunch.  My wife had the veggie pizza and I had the beef brisket grilled cheese.  She raved about the pizza and my grilled cheese.  I thought they were both very good. Will be back."}
{"text":"Om nom nom! I'm totally sold on this place. A little hidden away on Hwy 7, Smash is a great local eatery that serves some delicious food with good portions. I came here for a birthday dinner and since our party was so large, we had to get a set course meal but all the food options were great!  Service was fantastic - nothing got mixed up and they were super friendly and accommodating to all our asks. The risotto was amazing and hearty and huge! The seafood cake appetizer was fantastic, and the apple crumble was yuuuuum. I'd love to go back and keep trying more of their food.   You can find this place along Hwy 7 hidden in the back of the plaza beside Whole Foods."}
{"text":"The first time I went for brunch at around 11ish and didn't have a problem getting seated at all.  The coffee is wonderfully strong, the French Toast just melts on your tongue and may be the most amazing thing ever, the staff is very attentive, friendly and professional. The second time I went for lunch around 1:30 and had the option of either waiting 10 min for a table or sitting at the bar. I chose the bar. The seats are super comfortable and don't cut into your legs and cut off your circulation.  I had the eggs benedict.  They were just as good as I remembered the food being. Staff was just as amazing as the first visit. I will absolutely be back here!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. I came for brunch on a beautiful Sunday post vacation and was pleasantly surprised. The portions are huge and the service was spectacular. I would highly recommend making reservations as they do fill up fast especially for dinner."}
{"text":"There is a reason why there is always a packed restaurant at all times. Make sure to make a reservation ahead of time! The food here is pretty good and quite flavourful! Service is quick and efficient. And I always recommend this place if friends are in the area craving for American style comfort food with a higher quality and flavour than normal fast-food chains."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for brunch and I must say, we have had much better. The latte ($4.5) here is terrible. It pretty much tastes like office coffee. I should have known better when no one around us ordered specialty coffees and they didn't even have a coffee menu. Anyhow, to me, brunch and espresso based drinks go hand in hand, so this was definitely a shocker.   My girlfriend ordered the eggs benedict ($14) and we were pleasantly surprised when the food came within minutes of placing our order. That was until we found a long strand of hair in the sm'hash browns. Our waitress apologized and brought us a \"fresh\" plate within 2 minutes after they took it away.   The sm'hash browns, which is their version of home fries, tasted pretty decent. They were well seasoned and served nice and hot. The peameal bacon was slightly salty and juicy, but there was nothing exciting about the flavour profile. I found the hollandaise sauce to be on the heavy side and I missed the tanginess in it.   Overall, the eggs benedict wasn't bad, but there wasn't much to be thrilled about either. I would have considered returning to try other menu options as the service was efficient and friendly. However, that strand of hair in our food really made the experience unsavoury. With the god awful coffee as well, I am no rush to come back."}
{"text":"Love this place try and go to it whenever I can. Never had a bad experience and they always accommodate a large crowd"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place gets such rave reviews. If its because of the fusion style American food, I can say that there are a ton of better options out there. Came here for dinner and service was alright, there were no booth seats so we chose to sit at the bar. My friend and I both ordered a burger and it took quite awhile for the food to come...and this was only a burger. Service was alright, but from my experience this is just like any other fancier chain restaurant (ex. Milestones or Joey's) with overpriced food that didn't wow me or make me feel like it was worth the money. Will not be returning, as there are many better alternatives in the area."}
{"text":"Great service .  Need to take reservations all the time.  Would like to go earlier and be guaranteed a seat.  Great desserts"}
{"text":"Loved this place!!! Here from Michigan for work, we loved it!! It's kind of a weird spot, corner of that mall but it's super nice inside. Great decor, classy. Good was excellent, amazing side Caesar salad, and the Neptune pizza was incredible!!! Omg so good. Great wine too I had the Pinot Riesling blend yum! Service was very good too, really nice people!!"}
{"text":"Recently went here with a couple friends, and was pretty happy with the overall experience.   Service at the table was amazing overall. She was super nice and accommodating. My friend and I were trying to decide between a red and white sangria, so she gave us a bit of both to try to help make our decision.   We did try to get the wifi password, but the server gave us the wrong password a couple times, ended calling over the owner, and still no one knew the password... Said he would come back, but never did...  She also pushed us for the special appetizer and entree which I ended up getting. Spicy tuna wontons were really good and beautifully plated. I personally would have liked them spicier, but they were quite good.  The tandoori halibut on curry risotto was amazing. All the flavours came together nicely, and made a nice fusion plate. Again, more spiciness would have made a better dish for me, but it was still very good.   Overall a good experience, but in the end felt that it was overpriced for the food we got."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Located inside the Plaza beside the pet hospital. We love coming to this location. The outer appearance doesn't do this resto justice. The food especially the mac and cheese and corn are some of my favourite dishes. Good place to throw a party as well as they have 2 separate rooms for guests."}
{"text":"The food was okay but it was pricey for what you get. My kids love the chicken and waffles. The pizza was okay. I had the meatloaf and it was good. We didn't make reservations and I felt a bit uneasy with the receptionist's tone and reaction like she was bothered for us showing up as walk in customers."}
{"text":"Food: 7/10 -- Value: 6.5/10 -- Service: 8/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 9/10  The value is the biggest downfall here relative to any restaurant you could visit in Markham for dinner. Compared to other western-style food restaurants, it's on par.   APPETIZER/SNACK: Ahi Tuna Wontons ($14) --------------------------------------------------- This is the kind of thing that I don't find good value but that's commonplace in western restaurants. You get three wontons (not sure if I'd call them wontons, but they're open upward-facing chip bowls almost). They were tasty none the less. The most prominent flavour was the peanut dressing and everything else takes a backseat. I love everything peanuts, so I enjoyed it. I'd still like to know what part of this dish was worth $14 though.  MAIN: Grilled Salmon Nicoise Salad ($17) --------------------------------------------------- I didn't think this looked very good, but I googled \"nicoise salad\" and they all kind of look like that. I just realized the salmon that we were told would be cooked medium rare was pretty much cooked all the way through. It's a salad. I don't have much to say about it other than that it was fine.  MAIN: Chorizo Pizza ($14) --------------------------------------------------- Basil pesto, mozzarella, rapini, caramelized onions, goat cheese, pico de gallo. This was good, my favourite parts being the goat cheese and rapini. To be quite honest, I haven't really had bad pizza before. I feel like one of the fundamental components of pizza is being amazing.   DESSERT: Banana Chocolate Toffee Cake ($7) --------------------------------------------------- I wish the slice had been bigger, but it was delicious!  I've heard a few people say Smash is overrated. I can see why they'd say that. It's pretty ordinary western food with a self-ascribed \"upscale\" label. If you check-in on Yelp, I think you get 10% off and I was lucky enough for my friend's office to have a 15% off employee perk. With the discounts, I was satisfied with the amount we paid at $50 for an appetizer, two mains, and a dessert.   The restaurant is nice though. We were seated right by the fake (?) fireplace and the vibe of the restaurant was really lax and comfortable. I can imagine the booths being nice.  We went on a Friday night without a reservation at 7:00pm and didn't have to wait for a table for two.  In general, this is a pretty nice place. It's not cheap, but it's acceptable for a change of pace once in a while or a nicer place to catch up with friends. Without the discount? Hmm..."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant!  I got a grilled veggie sandwich and my mother got a lobster grilled cheese, and we ended up splitting the sandwiches half and half. The veggie sandwich was one of the best I've had, I devoured it. While I also enjoyed the lobster mac and cheese, I found that the slices of bread it came on were a bit big, some bites I felt like I tasted just bread. I also would consider it more of a lobster club than Mac and cheese, having come with Bacon, tomato, and chipotle sauce. However it had big chunks of lobster and was tasty.   I found the prices reasonable ($12 and $15) and there were tons of options on the menu. I will most definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My first time here was on Family Day for my birthday. The Monday special for $10 pizzas is great. We started with the Greek pizza and grilled calamari, both were really tasty. For our entrees we shared the fried chicken, Cobb salad, and the monster burger. The corn that accompanied the chicken was really tasty, their French fries with the burger were awesome, and everything else exceeded our expectations. The portions are quite large and for four people we had way too much food. I would highly recommend this restaurant.   Also, the birthday donuts were really good!"}
{"text":"I had just finished a fitness competition, and coming off of a strict diet, I was very excited to have a burger - and Smash did not disappoint! I ordered the Monster minus one patty (it comes with two) and destroyed it. It was so juicy and packed with lots of flavour. Our server was very nice and attentive. He chatted a lot with us throughout our visit. He was impressed to see how quick I ate my burger because I'm tiny in nature. After we had paid our bill, our server offered us dessert. He gave us Smash Mini Donuts. These tasted like a blend between timbits (but 5x better) and Tiny Toms donuts. I would definitely recommend Smash. Great for a night out after a fitness competition for sure."}
{"text":"ALL MY PICTURES OF THE FOOD GOT DELETED   But don't worry I'm still going to write this review:  FIRST, the service and staff here are seriously the nicest people ever ! they are very accommodating and kept checking up on us to see if everything was okay !   The food is pretty okay but the vibe of the place definitely makes up for it  The truffle mac and cheese was a little bit too cheesy and gives you that weird feeling afterwards but my friends ordered the LA one and they said it was good. Overall 3.5/5 for the food.   FINALLY i just gotta say that the patio is super beautiful and makes you feel rich even when you're poor"}
{"text":"I had a dinner with a friend here and I must say I think there's a little more hype about this place than what it actually is.  I do think the atmosphere is nice, it's clean and it has a good vibe.  However I found the food (which is the main reason I go out to bars n restaurants) mediocre. I had a hard time selecting something to eat as I am currently trying to make healthier choices, so I ended up getting their chicken salad. This salad consisted of chicken, lettuce, avocado, boiled egg, goat cheese, tomatoes and chickpeas.  I felt that it literally tastes like canned food all around.  I think I could have made a better salad myself.  I was quite disappointed.  I've ordered salads at other restaurants before and I've been extremely impressed at the quality and taste.  This was def not up to par.   My friend got the steak medium rare with mashed potatoes and sweet potato fries.  I did get a few bits of the steak which is why this review is getting 3 stars instead of 2.   I found the steak quite delicious, as did my friend.    Would I go here again? I probably will cause of close proximity but not because I really really want to.  The atmosphere is nice and it is super clean which is important. But overall food was disappointing.  Maybe with some improvement to their salad menu i can change this review ..."}
{"text":"You'd think that after living in a town for years that I would have a strong grasp of most of the bomb dining in the area. Guess not, because the folks at Smash Kitchen & Bar know what they're doing.  A group of maybe 20+ of us went to Smash on a Monday night for dinner. Surprisingly, considering the day of the week, the place was super active. (Apparently, I'm the last one in the city to come here.) Thankfully, Smash has plenty of space and seating, so our group was easily accommodated. You'll find regular dining seating as well as bar seating and TVs, so I suppose you could head over to watch the game. (Though in my trashy opinion in this regard, I like to watch sports in less upscale environments. Weird? Probably.) The general vibe of the place is upscale bar, but still rather casual.   On to the food! Since there were so many of us, I got to see a large variety of what they serve. Holy mother of Jesus, do these guys know how to plate stunning dishes! When they were placed on the table, it was the food equivalent of walking into a room of models, minus the sexual attraction. I'll skip the description. Just look at photos. But how does it actually taste you ask? After much deliberation, I ordered the Smash Burger. Friends who had already been to Smash suggested several items, but I was smitten by the idea of the Smash Burger, which is apparently prepared with tiny cubes of butter distributed through the patty. (I cannot 100% guarantee the validity of that claim.)  For about $17 I was served up two beef patties, sandwiched between a brioche bun, with cheddar cheese, whatever Smash Sauce is, lettuce, pickles, and onion chips. The burger also comes with a side, (sweet potato fries for me), and dip. Aside from being beautiful, the burger was wonderfully satisfying. It's not as if I could discern whether the mystery cubes of butter existed, but boy was the patty pleasantly moist. The onion chips gave the burger a welcome crunch, and the Smash Sauce did it's flavourful work. For someone who has been on a Best Burger tour of Toronto, I can't say that this burger broke any records, but I can say that the Smash Burger is close to as good a burger that you're going to get without stepping more outside of the box in terms of typical burger ingredients.  The staff at Smash are gracious and generally fantastic, the food looks and tastes beautiful, and the decor and setup is well thought out. This is one of those would-be 5 stars, but on the knock-my-socks-off scale, my socks were firmly on. Great restaurant."}
{"text":"Horrible, inattentive service despite dining there at 2:30 on a Saturday. The place wasn't busy at all and there were plenty of waitresses/servers available. It seemed as though we had three different waitresses as our orders were taken by one, a follow up on whether we were happy with our food was asked by another, and our bill was paid to yet another waitress.  Despite having 3 different waitresses aware of our existence, the entire service experience was slow and fraught with inattentive/indifference towards our table.   Aside from the service, the food was pretty good for the most part. The soup of the day (smoked chicken) was great. The tuscan chicken wrap was also really good. The duck taco was dry and the creole pasta was average and overpriced at $20. The dessert (chocolate bar) was stale.   Overall, I would be reluctant to return or recommend Smash Kitchen and Bar based on the service. The food was good but not good enough to outweigh the service experience."}
{"text":"We've come here a few times for work lunches. The food is very good and the service is always friendly. I've had the burger (excellent) and the grilled salmon salad nicoise. The servings are quite large.  My coworkers go crazy for the roasted tomato corn soup, which I can't have as there's dairy in it.  Prices are higher than what I usually do for lunch (mid to high teens)."}
{"text":"I found out about this place from the unionville festival last weekend and they were selling 'sexy on a bun' which was Mac & cheese on BBQ pork and peameal bacon  So this Sunday my bf and I decide to come and try out their brunch menu.   I ordered the crab cake Benedict and my bf got the French toast. The crab cake was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside with right amount of saltiness. When you eat it with the egg Benedict it creates the perfect combination.   The French toast was coated with lots of cinnamon sugar makes the dish so much more enjoyable. The only thing I wish they could add was something savory on the side to balance the flavor. (Which is why my bf ordered additional bacon for $2)   Our server was Jason which was the same guy we saw at Unionville. You can tell he's very passionate about his job and this restaurant.   Overall, we had a wonderful experience and will definitely come back for their dinner menu."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this establishment for large groups. Although the food was good and the server was efficient, the restaurant refused to separate our bills. We escalated this to the manager Brett, and he threatened to charge 21% if we insisted on having our bills split. He was very unprofessional and quite rude. He was eating with his friends in the restaurant and seemed annoyed that we interrupted him with the billing issue.  He was more concerned with proving the customer is always wrong. Not a good outlook to have if you work in the service industry!"}
{"text":"We thought we would try this place as the reviews were good. It was a Friday and the place was crowded and quite noisy. Fun atmosphere. The service was amazing. They could not do enough to make us happy. The food was also great. It was perfect for a cold rainy night. They advertise that they do comfort food and it sure was. The meatloaf was delicious as was the steak. Both dishes were rich (maybe a little too rich) and very good."}
{"text":"I brought my little sister here for her birthday since it was fairly close to the theatre. We both had a salad, both were large helpings, fresh, and delicious. My salmon was seated just right!  We got the ahi tuna wontons to start, and they were great. Tuna was fresh and the slaw was yummy, but the wontons could be smaller so they are more bite size.  I had a Glass bottle diet coke to drink (classy!!).  Also, since I mentioned it was her birthday our fantastic server brought a little martini glass out with these yummy little warm apple doughnut hole dessert (can't remember what it was called but it was delicious).  All the servers were friendly and courteous and took extra care to make sure we were looked after, we felt VIP. Our server had a great offbeat personality. All in all we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been here for both brunch and dinner - noted that weekend mornings/afternoons are packed so be prepared with reservations!   The food here is alright. In my opinion, it's just your typical Canadian restaurant. The interior is modern and classy, and the dinner prices reflect that as well. The food is acceptable - not my favorite but definitely a contender for business in Markham.   For brunch, I ordered a crab cakes eggs benedict and while the presentation was on point, I felt queasy near the end of eating it. I just think the texture of the mushy crab cakes didn't combine well with the dense, viscous yolk of the egg. Anywho, that's just my personal experience.   For dinner, I came on taco night so I ordered 3 different tacos. They were good and probably the most worth it item to order on the menu since it was at a promotional price. I guess since there aren't any good Mexican restaurants left in Markham, this place wouldn't be too bad for satisfying a craving of non-authentic tacos."}
{"text":"Cool hip restaurant   Came with with my family couple months back and ordered a salmon salad with Greek cheese. Good quality and great taste overall. Refreshing dishes that would appeal to all age groups."}
{"text":"Overall a great place for lunch or dinner even with a bigger group. Huge options with a wide range of dishes. Came here on a Wednesday for lunch and got the $10 Smash Burger (special price on Wednesday). The burger looked great with two patties and crisp onions on top. Burger was juicy and cooked nicely to medium rare. Solid burger but not stand out. Fries were good, definitely above average.   Friendly and fast service. I like the atmosphere: relaxed, spacious, nicer than a typical bar/grill.   Also came here for a bday party back in Feb. We had the private room near the front and it was a great night. Everyone liked the food and we got attentive service."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times for brunch, lunch and dinner.  Love everything about this place.. the ambience, the staff, the FOOD, and the location (cuz I live nearby haha).  I've been here with a large group (8+ people), for dates, or just a quiet dinner to catch up with a few friends so Smash is pretty much suitable for all occasions.  They also have these private rooms with TV's for larger parties.. which would probably be very amazing if a group wants to get together and watch a sports game or something...   Let's focus back on the food... Smash doesn't have the largest food selection, but everything we've tried to date is very delicious.  They are currently doing an all-you-can-eat ribs thing everyday after 5, and some seasonal dishes in additional to their regular menu that sounded very appealing.  We tried their fish tacos from the seasonal menu for appetizers, and OMG, they were HUGE and so DELICIOUS.  The batter on the fish was extremely light, and the guacamole was creamy.  I was actually a little full after my 1.5 taco, but next up are the ribs so I gotta make room for that!    Smash makes their ribs different than most places.  Instead of giving you a rack, each rib is served individually and coated with BBQ goodness.  The ribs are piled on top of mashed potato and corn, and the portion is so big there's always left overs for lunch the next day.  The other entrée we ordered was the 12oz rib eye... it was very flavorful but it didn't stand out as much as the ribs.    For dessert, we shared the NY cheesecake which was covered with blueberries.  The cheesecake was very good, light, and the crust was like shortbread.  Yum.  The best part of our experience is always the staff.  They are always friendly and accommodating to our requests.  The owner, Jason, is also amazing and checked up with us several times to make sure we're happy and taken cared of.  All in all, a wonderful experience here every time."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner on Sunday with some friends.   The wife and I shared a Sunday family platter.   $65 for quite the variety.   The boneless chicken with jalapeno was full of flavour.   The ribs were plentiful and fall off the bone.  The Mac and cheese was oozing with cheese, and was tasty.  Other items that came were the andouille sausage and jalapeno bread rolls.   The last item and maybe the only negative was the corn.   The core was still cold so either it was sitting for a while or it was frozen and didn't thaw all the way through.  All in all the platter was more than enough.   One of our dinner companions ordered the lobster Mac and cheese.   At first glance the dish contains a healthy portion of lobster.   Unfortunately it was not cooked and still translucent.    The staff as usual were phenomenal.   They handled it very quickly and made it more than right before you could even complain about it.     I have never had a problem with service at smash.  What I love is that all staff management and all pitch in and Hussle to get things done.     Will definitely keep coming back as it is a nice place to have a meal and relax with friends."}
{"text":"Started with drinks, asked for a cocktail cherry with my old fashion and got a blank stare back as if I asked for something she had never heard of. Gently asked her to try and not to worry.  Sangria was decent, sweet. Old fashion was ok.  Had KFB, wasn't great, wasn't bad.  Firecracker shrimp was edible, over fried Roasted brussel sprouts were also forgettable, boiled sprouts tasted better Duck fried rice was gross, I think they used Orzo..."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for this restaurant for weekend brunch. The quality of the food is great, but for the price, I think there are better alternatives.  They have a prix fixe menu, so we went with that along with our groupon, which also included 4 glasses of sangria per person (it's a lot for a brunch!).  The eggs benedict was great, flavour, proportions were perfect.  Sangria was good. Service was also good, so there isn't too much to complain about :)"}
{"text":"Smash lives up to the Hype and bounces perfectly on Target!  We came with a big group and our server Sarah was wonderful!  She was  friendly, enthusiastic, and laughed at all our corny jokes. She never missed our orders from shots to food to cutlery.  I ordered the Neptune Pizza and the Smash Burger. The burger was sooo juicy and it was only $12 with a salad.  Dare I say it may have even tasted better than Burger Priest...uh oh I hope I dont get punished for that comment from the Pope.. haha!  The Pizza tasted phenomenal and the shrimp and salmon complimented each other like chicken and rice....mmmm...chicken and rice...  Anyways back to Smash...the drinks were on point and the food and service were wonderful! We will be coming back for their specials in the future and Smash our way here like the Mario Brothers!"}
{"text":"It is casual hangout pub . They has Monday, Tues Wed Thurs and Sunday specials.   I enjoy the food"}
{"text":"Its a very nice place- the ambiance was the highlight. I went on a stormy Friday and the place was VERY busy.   They have a great drink menu and also daily specials, unfortunately not on Friday's. The staff was very friendly and informative. However, it was my first time there and I think I went overboard. Everything i ordered was deep fried and accompanied by the beer that I drank- I was stuffed. The highlight of my visit was the lobster taco's. They were delicious.   I was very impressed and most definitely going to head back to try out their $10 burger special."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. Ordered the Cobb salad and crab cake Benedict to share. Food was tasty but on the expensive side. The Cobb is you average salad and at $16 you're better off with one of the other brunch items. Also check that all the ingredients are present. My salad was missing the egg and they had to bring it out separately after we told the server. Chicken was tender and well seasoned. Benedict came with poached eggs sitting atop crab cakes instead of English muffins. Crab cakes were crispy on the outside with flavour of real crab coming through strong. I would have preferred to have English muffins with crab cake and egg on top to balance out the saltiness and richness of the egg and crab cake. Overall, solid food, airy and comfortable surroundings. Friendly servers. Overpriced. Would come back to try other non brunch items."}
{"text":"Great place to bring a first date or to have a casual meal with friends/family.  Years ago when Smash opened up, it was second to none because there was no competition in the area for the same type of cuisine. Today, that still remains the same.  This review is based on a Wednesday  birthday luncheon for a party of five.  Service: 4/5 Our server was attentive, thoughtful and funny. Rare to see these qualities these days.  Food:  The pizzas were definitely unique in terms of the toppings. Taste: hit or miss. I really liked the one with salmon and meat lovers pizza, but the one with the egg....not so much.  For the sides we ordered:  L.A. Mac & cheese with bacon 3.5/5 2x truffle mac & cheese 5/5 sweet potato fries 5/5  I really love the vibe at smash. Very relaxing after a long day/week from work.  I'll be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"First impression walking in from the parking lot: this doesnt look like what I imagined...it's in a small plaza and looks like a small place. But, the restaurant is quite large on the inside and very modern looking with a bar + family restaurant feel. Before I even had a chance to take off my jacket someone came by to give me two glasses of water. Our main waitress came by shortly after to take our drinks order and as we were looking around (just to check out the ambiance) another waiter came by to check up on us. Our server was good and he replaced my white sangria with a red once I said it wasnt that good (and he checked up on me to see if I'd like the white). So, I'd have to say really good customer service. Menu has a variety of foods ranging from paella to burgers and pizzas to sandwiches and salads and the typical mains like ribs, chicken, steak, grilled salmon. What was interesting was the fusion dishes on the menu like ahi tuna wontons and eggplant tempura tacos (the tacos was on their Easter weekend menu). Check-in with Yelp to get a 10% off voucher on food (food only, not drinks). I had the ahi tuna on a wonton crisp to start. There was a bed of slaw with peanut sauce between the wonton wrapper and tuna. The serving was too big to fit in your mouth in one bite but you'd have to \"smash\" it apart to eat it otherwise. it was decent...kinda felt like chef tried a little too hard to make it \"asian\" with the typical asian ingredients (wonton wrapper, peanut dressing).  Also had the lobster rolls ($16) which I didnt think was great. Not a lot of lobster meat and it was overpowered by all the minced onions. Came in a trio of mini burger buns that could've used some toasting prior to being served. Main entree was the bbq chicken pizza. Had cashews and and corn kernels on it which was interesting but I dont think I like having it on my pizza. What I did like was that it was a tomato sauce and not bbq sauce as the base...the taste of bbq sauce was mild and in just the right amount. A bit too much cheese. Centre was soggy so I prefered eating the outter half which was thin crust and crispy. My gf likes this pizza but I dont think I'd have it again. The two bourbon drinks on the menu were not to our liking. The vanilla bean one was too sweet and was more a girly cocktail. The second one (starts with an \"n\") didn't have any citrus in it so not the way we like our bourbon drinks but at least it wasnt as sweet. The Smash caesar was good but could use a little more clamato juice in the blend. It's pretty spicy! Liked that it came with a pickled bean, olive and pepper. Sangrias were just okay. i liked the fresh fruits stirred into it. Sundays are $5 caesars and sangrias so I got both.  Overall, it was a good venue but I dont think it'd be top of mind for food choice in the Markham area and I wasnt able to find anything to really rave about except the service and ambiance."}
{"text":"The last time I visited Smash for a friend's birthday, I must say I was less than impressed by the service that was given to us.  We had a large party but that should not stop anyone from giving us poor customer service because we are still paying customers that would have returned if we were treated better.  We all got our drink orders in and ordered our food and I went with my favourite, Pride of Nova Scotia oven pizza.  Again, the food here has never been a disappointment.  I presented my Yelp coupon which was a free appetizer which I am entitled to if I order 2 entrées.  I asked the waitress if I could use this coupon and she said that it was an older coupon and the new coupon was 10% off the total bill but she'd double check with her manager to see if they could still honour it for me.  I waited and waited and she never came back with an answer.  Then after waiting for a good half an hour or so, I was able to get her attention to order my next drink and follow up with her in regards to the coupon.  She then explained to me that they cannot honour the free appetizer but I would recieve 10% off the total bill. After everyone was done their food, we mingled a bit and then got our bills.  We were then told we were not able to do separate bills because upon making the reservations the birthday girl did not request for separate bills.  Kind of stupid but fine, no biggie.  Then as we were going to pay, she 'forgot' to apply the 10%.  She then insisted that we must show two different coupons on two different phones to make sure we can have 10% off each of our tables (because we had two large tables).  She further explained that she had to see it and when I showed her my old coupon she denied it and said she needed the coupon that shows 10%, making it all very difficult for us. I have to say that I hope that the next time I come that I will have a Smashing experience than want to Smash the place apart for the unimpressive customer service.."}
{"text":"Given the choices for brunch in the area, it is quite easy to see why this place is busy. The food, service and quality was quite good for the price. Was looking to opt in for the prix fixe but we decided against it and just ordered the regular breakfast with a side waffle and the crab cake benedict. The portions were big and the food was tasty. The coffee was a bit weak and had a fairly decent tea collection if you weren't looking to booze it up. I would definitely recommend as the hours for brunch are good, the location is easy to get to and fairly cheap and cheerful."}
{"text":"Smashing my brunch standards! Came in for Sunday brunch around 11 pm (no reservation) and was promptly seated. There is a good mix of tables (patio and indoors) as well as bar seats. Ordered the Smash Benedict while others ordered the Classic Breakfast, French Toast and Meatloaf Skillet. The eggs were nice and runny, and the cheese, pulled pork and gravy complemented each other well. Potatoes were light, and really liked the touch with putting peppers and onions to mix it up. Service was extremely attentive throughout, with all staff (along with our designated server) making sure that everything was up to par and water was always filled.   Contemplated getting the prix fixe brunch ($20 for entree + dessert + coffee/tea), but was somewhat glad I passed since I was already so full after the entree. Food looked good, tasted good, and service was awesome! Will be back to try the other brunch items. Between this and NextDoor (sister restaurant) I prefer Smash, but it is obvious that the service is consistently positive between the two."}
{"text":"Wow! This is the second time I have had lunch there and it did not disappoint.  It was a bit loud for my personal taste but we were seated at the quietest booth.   The server could not have been more helpful in assisting us with deciding between all the wonderful offerings. We decided on the spicy shrimp appetizer, the house burger and corn bread.  The shrimp was out of this world; crunchy, yummy deliciousness.   Enough said. Go there."}
{"text":"Came here last night for Father's day dinner, extremely disappointed with the food and service. I normally don't do any reviews and never complain about my food but this time Smash EXTREMELY disappointed me and my family and I will probably never be returning.   Their lobster Mac and Cheese was $27 but only had 2 fingernail sized pieces of lobster. the staff was not very helpful when I brought this up. Service was slow and my server had to be reminded about simple things like refilling water and getting ketchup for people having fries. I would rate it lower than 1 star if I could.  Or maybe the menu just had a typo... Taking away the \"LOBSTER\" in \"Lobster Mac and Cheese\" would be a better represent this dish."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and got the Smash benedict. Great flavours with the gravy and pulled meat. What a flavourful twist to the traditional benedicts. The potatoes were seasoned well. Not a fan of the bell peppers that was in it though. It was a hearty brunch! Reasonable price, good portion that filled me. Good service."}
{"text":"Pleasant surprise for brunch! This place is a bit hidden as I wasn't aware of it until my friends met up here for brunch. They have a great fixed price menu for brunch with unlimited coffee and desert and a main for $20. It was too good of a deal to pass up, so I went for it :) I got the Eggs Benedict with coffee and cheesecake. The portions was surprisingly larger than I had expected - especially for the price! The dish even came with some fresh fruits which was a nice touch. The restaurant's atmosphere is almost similar to a milestone or moxie's! Our waitress was super friendly and accommodating. Overall, I am quite happy with the brunch experience and I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A great little bar/lounge in Unionville. I had the beef cheek poutine, which was too salty (but still satisfying because: poutine); the bacon wrapped shrimp, which for an appetizer was a healthy portion with 5 jumbo shrimp.   I was a bit disappointed because their patio was closed on a 30 degree day, as they hadn't yet opened for the season. The service was a bit unattentive, and left us for long stretches without any contact, including after being seated.   Seems like a good place to grab a beer or Caesar and snack and watch a game, or relax on the patio, which I could sadly see from the window as I sat indoors."}
{"text":"I went here for my birthday and it was amazing. I ordered a steak and requested rare. To my surprise, it was done perfectly. No other restaurants have done it to my expectations. My friends ordered a variety of different entrees and one that got the most praise was the crab cakes.   They were more than happy to serve me and my 10 other guest with a open embrace and a big smile.   I would definitely go back again for the food and service."}
{"text":"Came here with my friends for Brunch. LOVE the portions, and love the food even more. The service was excellent. I was surprised by how big the portions were, I've been to a couple of Brunch place and they don't normally serve you a big portion.   Make sure you rsvp in advance! They book up really quickly!! And check in you get 10% discount :)"}
{"text":"Came to Smash on a late Saturday night. This restaurant is hidden in a corner of a strip plaza. The restaurant itself is fair in size and has a menu filled with many varieties.   We opted to order the ahi tuna tacos to start and then I got the lobster mac and cheese while my Fiance got the half chicken and rib combo. The ahi tuna tacos were quite tasty. A good chunk of tuna with a fair amount of toppings. My lobster mac and cheese was quite underwhelming. When I think of a good mac and cheese, I think of gooey warm cheese as I bite into it.. unfortunately mine was hard and not gooey at all. At some points, I even contemplated if they used KD cheese as their cheese.. not a lot of lobster in the mac and cheese as well. Bits and pieces but not a good chunk. My mac and cheese was also overpowered with bread crumbs.   My Fiance had the rib and chicken combo. His ribs were quite tender and fall off the bone so he enjoyed it. Smash also has a list of cocktails as well but we did not opt to try any. I don't think I will be returning to smash unless someone is having an event there."}
{"text":"Food was okay. I had the caesar salad and BBQ chicken pizza. The food was similar in quality to food that I could find at many other similar restaurants that serve pasta, pizza, and Burgers. Overall experience was okay, but certainly nothing I would rush back for."}
{"text":"The service here started off great. We were served immediately and the servers were friendly. We had a party of 4 on a Sunday at 1pm. We were seated on the high tops because it was so packed and we had no reservations. FYI Make Reservations here on Weekends!!!!  Brunch  Smash French Toast  This was incredible. It looks like a really big portion when I first saw it but the toasts are light and fluffy and manageable for one person with an appetite.   Crab Cake Benedict These were great. I loved the sauce and the crab cakes themselves were a unique touch. They were cooked to perfection, warm and went well with the toppings. The potatoes served with this dish were fresh, not cold, overdone or hard.   On our way out, the server forgot to bring us our take out containers and our bill took forever to come back when we handed the server cash. Hence my 4/5 stars. This is a great atmosphere, nice layout and clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"I have to give this place a 5 star review, because it happens to be my go-to spot when I'm looking for somewhere \"fancy\" but not break the bank.  My favourite dishes here are the salads (tuna salad being my favourite) as well as anything off their brunch menu! If you are looking to indulge, their lobster mac and cheese is worthy every calorie."}
{"text":"So being my first time coming here and hearing a lot about this place, I had high expectations  for  my experience  here. I was actually  pretty  disappointed.  When I first walked in, was ignored and not greeted. I had to assert myself to SOMEONE to assist me into getting a table.  So the lady, who I assume is the hostess, was rude and looked as if she didn't want to deal with me. Even though I didn't have a reservation, I thought I could make it easier by letting her know we only need a high chair if that helps. Her response  was quick and snotty. However, to make things better our server, Kevin, was really professional and courteous. He did check on us and made sure we were OK. The food is good and with a decent quantity. On another  good note there is an bathroom that is designated for people to change babies in which is a total Plus! Would definitely consider coming back again maybe for dinner."}
{"text":"Awesome night yet again. The food was fantastic! Wasn't feeling like eating until Christina told me to try the brisket beef grilled cheese. You have to try this if you haven't before.. The beef was juicy and fatty and the sandwich itself was superb! Had coleslaw in it as well, which made it so much better in my opinion. Noms..."}
{"text":"A late review from last year. We took advantage of YELP's Burger Binge Event and tried their $14 burger for only $5. All really, really good burger that is worth the regularly steep price but we made out like bandits that day."}
{"text":"Service was great, atmosphere was great, food was good. Prices are a little higher than average but the place was packed so obviously people are willing to pay. I'd come here again.. probably to try one of the daily specials."}
{"text":"Service: Very good. Hostess and waiters were polite, friendly and helpful. Gave us just enough time to order, and then after the meal to bring the bill. Manager dropped by to check in, which is always a nice touch. Servers are attractive, so that's always a plus for anyone who cares. 5/5 for service  Menu: Not the most extensive menu, like most semi-upscale places but some neat looking options. We went for the crab cakes and chicken pizza to start with, and the 10oz steak (medium rare, the only right way to eat it) and fire-grilled chicken breast. There's a decent selection of different types of mains. Prices are a little on the higher side, but nothing too extraordinary.Pretty similar, once again, to something like Joey's and Moxies, but hey, it's how the food tastes that counts. 3.5/5 for menu selection/price  Food: Crab cakes were amazing, easily one of the best i've tried. Chicken pizza was just as good. Thin crust always helps, and they put cashews on the pizza which was new to me. The main courses weren't QUITE as good. The mashed potato that came with the mains were exceptional, but my steak was a little tough, despite being medium rare. Also not as flavourful as I had hoped for the prices that we had to pay. The chicken breast was excellent though: juicy, tender and straight up delicious. Would definitely recommend trying it out. 4.5/5 for food  Overall: One of the better restaurants I've been to recently. Left me full and satisfied, which is all you can really ask for. 4/5 overall. Would recumbent and visit again"}
{"text":"Omgoodness this place was incredible. Michelle and the service staff was extremely friendly and professional. And don't get me started on the food IT WAS AWESOME!!!! We had the Poseidon pizza, lobster Mac and cheese and The Monster burger! Holy moly evvvverything was delicious"}
{"text":"Came here for my 35th birthday with a group of friends and the experience was amazing from beginning to end. Our server managed our table with such ease and she made sure that everything was done right from the food to the drinks. I ordered the quinoa salad, korean tacos and the pizza to share and everything just tasted so good! For the price everything was decently sized and well worth it. I definitely want to come back and try their other menu items and daily specials."}
{"text":"Went here with a large group. Note to groups, don't expect good service because they auto grat you 18%. Not even exaggerating but from the minute we sat down, our waitress was rushing us. We had literally just taken our seats and the waitress was asking us for drinks. Not a big deal, quick service... But through the whole evening, she kept rushing us. We weren't ready to order when she came around and stated that we weren't but if she was going to take orders, she should start at the other end. She started at the end where people were still deciding. At the end of the meal, we tried to ask for a split bill but the manager cam over stating that they would the charge us 21% auto grat to split the bill. It wasn't even about the policy but the manager had mega attitude. He pretty much just walked away from us because he was too busy eating at the table across from us with his buddies. His attitude was clear that he couldn't be bothered to deal with us despite being a big table. If you do get bad service, don't expect the manager to care or do his job. First and last visit. The owner should reconsider their management if he plans on the establishment being successful.  NOTE: Thank you Jason for the response. Yes, many of us posted as we were a large party and were all disappointed by our experience and to be honest, is something Brett should have probably considered before giving us attitude. The negative experience wasn't just upon the split bill but started with our waitress who kept rushing us through the service. The bill was just what pushed the experience completely into the negative. When we spoke with the Brett, he claimed that he took my reservation so obviously something is being lost in communication. Again, I understand that at the time of the reservation it was stated that it would be one bill. However, I have never had an issue upon changing our preference at other establishments. It seems funny that you uphold the policy over something so trivial to the point of losing customers. I appreciate the offer of the gift card but will have to respectfully decline as I cannot see anyone from our party returning to your establishment. Hopefully, you reconsider your policy to prevent you from losing future customers."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Tuesday. We arrived at around noon and it wasn't very busy. The service is quite good but the food we had wasn't particuarly great. We ordered from the special lunch set menu. It's a choice of starter, main and dessert for $20. My friend got Caesar salad to start and I got the soup. Soup was ok tasting but not hot, just lukewarm. Then we both got the smash burger. It's a large enough burger, 2 patties, with cheddar cheese, pickles, lettuce and onion rings. However, the meat was not seasoned much, dry and charred. The patties were like home bbq'd with all the black carbon bits stuck to it. Fries were ok. Didn't offer refills on our diet cokes but refilled water a couple of times. Didn't have room for dessert but our waitress said that we could pack them to go, so we got the mini donuts to go. (My kids said that they were delicious, even cold.) Total came to $60 inc tax and tip for the 2 set lunches and 2 diet cokes.  Service is quite good Food is not that great, maybe other things are better. Decor is just basically a charcoal room with wood accents, Joey Markvilles is much better ambience Would return again but not too often, bit too pricy for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Last night, my boyfriend was like we are going back to this restaurant again to give it a second try. He said his co-worker told him the duck tacos were tasty. Here's my review:  Ambiance Very good, and comfortable seating. The lighting is perfect, as I hate pot lights in restaurant since I get migraines.   Food We ordered the duck taco $5 each. It was a very good size and the duck was flavourful. I only find the sauce a little to sweet and I would have preferred less crunchy pieces in the taco.  Ahi Tuna Wontons Seared and sesame crusted, peanut dressing, Asian slaw, horseradish aioli. The crust was very tasty. As I am not a huge fan of slaw and peanut dressing, I have to admit it was good combination of dressing. For people who likes slaw and peanut dressing and ahi tuna, it is worth a try.  Pride of Nova Scotia  Tomatoe sauce, mozzarella, lobster, roasted garlic, pico de gallo, shaved Parmesan. It was not bad, I can use a few more pieces of lobster on there. The crust was not bad, instead of shaved Parmesan, I think the home made chilli oil helped a lot, it was very tasty!    The service that Andrew provided us was top notch. He was very attentive, made you feel welcomed and a happy dining experience."}
{"text":"After seeing pictures of this place reviewed on my Instagram, I decided to check this place out when a group of girlfriends when one returned from HK for a visit and requested 'no Asian food'.   After looking at the online menu and checking for specials, we found out that it was 10$ pizza's on Mondays. There were some pretty fancy looking pizzas on the menu, so we made sure to ask our server if there were any limitations on what we could order. Nope, it was all 10$.  We got there at about 8, the place was busy but not packed.  Nice looking bar, tables and booths in dark fabrics and woods, cosy looking, casual fancy. Server was attentive and the food arrived quickly. Portions are good for sharing.   Returned recently for brunch and it was equally enjoyable."}
{"text":"Came in on a quiet Monday so service was on the slow side.   The salads looked amazing and I recommend the daily specials.  The fried chicken was nothing special but the food was good overall."}
{"text":"Smash is our go to restaurant for lunches with coworkers mainly because of the location and food quality.  We come for lunch right around 12pm and we generally make a reservation.There is never much of a wait time just a couple minutes of setting up the table.  The food itself is the main reason we return over and over again. The portions here are HUGE like i'm stuffed whenever I leave her and I return to work with a food coma. I love ordering their mac and cheese but be warned very cheesy and filling. If you are not a fan of cheese you won't enjoy this. But I'm a cheese lover and the mac and cheese here is a must try.   I would recommend getting the mac and cheese on the side with another entree like half a rack of ribs ($22 for ribs, mac, and cheese, cornbread and coleslaw). It's a smaller more manageable amount of mac and cheese. I had the lobster mac and cheese on its own once as an entree and I found it way too much for one sitting.  The servers and manager are very welcoming, they came around to our table at least 8 times to ensure we were happy. It shows that they care about customer satisfaction here and the automatic 18% tip for groups of 8 and over is still deserved. Most places that slap on a tip requirement stop caring but not at smash. They still work for it!   If you coming with a group it is recommended that you make reservations. The parking there is very spacious, not a lot of restaurants to compete with for parking just small businesses that are not open after 5.   Smash is tucked away in the corner of the plaza but it is definitely a go to for comfort food."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner on a weekday night, we first ordered the lettuce wraps and the Cobb salad for appetizers which tasted great. For dinner our party of 3 ordered the tandoori wrap, the BBQ brick chicken and the BBQ chicken pizza. Unfortunately, the pizza did not taste very good, but the staff was excellent in changing our order and brought us the warm steak salad instead which tasted great! Smash has an impressive staff and a diverse menu, definitely a place to check out in the GTA"}
{"text":"Located in the corner of the plaza.  I used to go here when it was Bluestone Bistro.  If not for Yelps Burger Binge I would not of known it reopened as Smash Kitchen.  Place is masked by a veterinarian sign.  I was not impressed with draft the beer selection, they have several beers but no diversity.  I'm not into lagers, there's usually at least a Rickards Red or of I'm really lucky a Mill Street Tankhouse.  Even looked into the bottled beer with no luck.  This is the perfect style of restaurant to put an emphasis on craft beers.  I would throw in a Flying Monkey on tap.  It may seem picky, but I'm sure I'm not alone in this being a reason to return or not.  I was here for the burger binge week, so my wife and I both got a $5 smash burger.  If the rating was just for this I would give it five stars.  Fresh ingredients, used the right bun, juicy, all that stuff that makes for a tasty burger.  But the other items were not up to par.    We ordered the Ahi tuna on wonton.  The dish had potential, but the star of this dish is the tuna and unfortunately it was overun by large wontons and far too much salad.  It made for an oversized appetizer.  This is an easy fix.    My son got the buttermilk fried chicken (which I convinced him of just so I could try it).  They should take a lesson from my wife on this.  The chicken was a breast with no skin, first mistake.  The batter was all wrong, way to thin, second mistake.  And lastly, it was not coated properly because it didn't stick to the meat.  Overall a good experience, friendly staff and great atmosphere, but there are subtle improvements needed to some of the dishes.  I'll be back to see how it goes."}
{"text":"A hidden little gem with pretty good food but a bit pricey for its value. Smash burger was delish, lamb lollipops were mediocure & the Neptune pizza was so so. Service was great, good effort from the staff in training! Comfy and relaxing ambiance, a great place to watch sports games than the regular crowded bars!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times within a month and a half-ish. It went from 4 stars to approximately a 2.5 :(   First time was brunch and we got the crab cake benedict and the smoked salmon benedict. The one thing I dislike about their brunch is that there's no garden salad and instead, you get peppers. The crab cake was a bit on the oily side (I get it, it was probably deep fried but at least dabbing some of the oil first). Other than that it was decent.  Second and third time was for dinner. In both occassions we had the rib rack, the ribs and chicken and the lobster mac and cheese. The first time was amazing, the ribs had spicy corn and was done perfectly! The ribs fell right off the bone and was soo good. The fried chicken was a little dry though. Recently we went back for dinner and it seemed like the menu changed a bit and we ordered the same thing and a beer. The beer tasted flat and had a weird aftertaste. We got the beer changed for something else but it still tasted off... This time we had to choose a side for the ribs and we got the sweet potato fries and the corn again cause it was so memorable. Also, there was coleslaw and cornbread that automatically comes with it but both tasted bad. The lobster mac and cheese didnt come with a slice of bread this time but it tasted the same. The sweet potato fries were super good, but sadly this time the corn was a disaster. It was really bad - tasteless and mushy in the sense like it was frozen corn that has been frozen for way too long. The ribs were a little burnt and had much more fat on it this time. It didnt fall straight off the bone either this time.  I probably wont be coming here in a long time because the last dinner was a huge disappointment. The quality went down by a lot :("}
{"text":"I'm back!!  Another 4 star for yet another great experience here at Smash. My boyfriend who's usually out of town, waited long enough for his return home to grab the \"Smash Burger\". We made reservations for later in the evening, but our plans changed and ended up coming 2 hrs earlier. We had let the staff know about our reservations and apologized for the last minute changes! And yet they still managed to seat us right away, although it seemed quite busy.  We were very appreciative of this because we weren't expecting to be seated and were prepared to wait - even though we made reservations for a later time. Did I mention how friendly their staff is? Always greeted with smiles from everyone you pass by - VERY WELCOMING!   As for food...  Although my boyfriend chose to go with the same order but with a side of salad, I chose differently this time around. I was in the mood for a salad... not necessarily a Cesar Salad but something with a kick.  WARM STEAK SALAD (4.5/5)  It was everything I was craving. I requested medium rare steak on my salad and it came out perfectly. I love spinach. I love scallions. I love blue cheese. I pretty much loved everything about this salad. (Was my first time ordering a \"warm\" salad). Definitely worth a try!!!  Based off my boyfriend's feedback: SMASH BURGER (5/5) Recommended with a salad to balance out the salt and savoury. Last time he got the fries, and found it to be too filling. With a salad, he was much more satisfied! The burger itself is monstrous!!! It has Mac & a Cheese in the burger.. that explains it all.  Oddly enough, not surprised though, my boyfriend ate that thing in a span of maybe 10mins or less? I don't know how he did it, but our server was definitely impressed!   By the way, Josh (our server), you were a delight - we appreciate the kind service and friendly chat!   Hoping I can come back during brunch and grab the chicken and waffles!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite place to be, could not remember how many time I have been visited. BUT! Today! Curly Hair inside the pasta, and manager said it might be our hair? Rude AF ! What a joke!  Enough said, won't come back again. food is great, service not recommended ."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out again since we were craving margarita pizza and because this place has high ratings.  What we ordered last time affect our ratings so we decided to give this place another chance.  Unfortunately, we were disappointed because pizza (lunch menu) is available after 3pm.  We ended up ordering a Canadian Club.  They do give you enough meat (5 slices of peameal bacon!), 2 slices of tomatoes and lettuce.  The sauce in the sandwich definitely has some wasabi or horseradish-like ingredient.  The fries have some grilled vegetables.  The peameal bacon was a tad on the salty side.  Service was nice and friendly and overall it was an okay experience.  My only suggestion is... Please have pizza available for lunch!"}
{"text":"Got the smash burger and it was hella greasy. Definitely not worth the calories as the patty was not very flavorful. Go to the numerous other amazing Toronto spots. This place is lame"}
{"text":"Went on a Monday around 530 only to find out that there's a pizza special!  $10! The 4 of us all got a different pizza and shared, I enjoyed all of them! I'm pretty sure they are cooked in a wood oven.   I got the pride of Nova Scotia pizza which had lobster.. It was enjoyable, I would definitely get it again. Someone else got the meat pizza, the Neptune I think it was called with smoked salmon  and the last pizza was something with sausage. It's thin crust so if you feel like putting it all away it's doable!   We also got a pitcher of blonde beer I think it was $20+ for it, not too surprised about the price though, usually these bar/food places that try to be fancy and trendy will have higher drink prices.   Would definitely go back again to try different pizzas or another special they have.   Service was ok, she didn't seem personable or really care if we needed anything, when we walked in I sort of felt like they weren't attentive in seating us even though it was a little early for dinner.   Decor is a try hard Moxies with pretty comfortable booths!"}
{"text":"I went to Smash for brunch on a Sunday.  I had the Bacon Mushroom Omelette for $12. The omelette was decent, but nothing special. The toast was a bit too dry and hard. Pototoes were good. The portion was sizeable.  The scene is pretty nice, busy, but apparently you have to make a reservation. Since I didn't there were still seats for high top chairs."}
{"text":"Wifey had the Fixed Prixe Menu. Tomato Corn Soup to start was amazing. Definitely must try. Entree was flat iron steak and also done to perfection. For dessert, we had the Apple Crumble just so so. Nothing special.  Hubby had the lamb dish. Meat was so succulent and melt in your mouth.   Will definitely return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, lots of comfy food choices. Great atmosphere and helpful staff. Brunch on weekends is a must, and Smash Benedicts are yummy."}
{"text":"I've been to Smash on a couple occasions. My first time there was for brunch, $21 for a set meal was a decent deal. Second time I went, I treated my family to dinner and no one was really happy with their meal. Third time I went, my friend enjoyed his steak and my salad was okay. I stopped going for a while but decided to return for brunch once again...and once again the crab cake eggs benny was burnt and extremely greasy. The food came quick which was not what I expected for a place like this. We were nicely asked how our food was twice, and then past the hour mark felt slightly forced to leave when the waitress asked if we wanted anything else 4 times but there was no one waiting for our table. Anyway, food is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Mmmmm! Caught up with a few friends over brunch at Smash, and really enjoyed it! This place is a hidden gem in Unionville, tucked away in the corner of a somewhat random plaza.   I ordered the eggs florentine for my love of smoked salmon. The eggs were poached perfectly, and I liked how they weren't drowning in hollandaise sauce, which is the problem I usually have with eggs benny. The spinach and capers also paired really well with the salmon. Eaten alone, the hash browns got a bit too salty after a while, so I'd recommend having it with ketchup. Overall, a very well thought-out dish!  The french toast came with 4 large blocks of toast. It was really warm and soft, and the cinnamon flavour was delicious! My friend ordered this dish alone though, and the taste got repetitive after eating half of it, so I'd advise ordering this to share rather than as a main course.  My other friends went with the prix fixe, which came with a main course, coffee/tea, and dessert. They loved their crab cakes benedict and the meatloaf skillet (which remained hot even over an hour into the meal).  We were seated at a table in the corner, and ended up staying for a solid 5 hours without getting kicked out! It's a classy, yet casual, place to spend an afternoon or evening. I would definitely come back to try other items on their menu!"}
{"text":"Had lunch with a friend today, both our first time here.  She ordered the lobster mac and cheese and I had the smash burger. We were both so full by the end of the meal and didn't even finish everything.   I had the chance to try the lobster mac and cheese as I took a bite from my friends dish. We both agree it was good. The flavour and creaminess of it was on point! I didn't really see the lobster in it but my friend said she had some in there. I had the burger with added mushrooms and a side of fries. It was good. I felt like it was an average burger and I really can't complain because it was the Wednesday special. $10 instead of $15 . It was a really heavy meal because there were two thick burger patties, so if you like your meat it's a good burger.   Overall enjoyed the space and food and I really want to come back for brunch next time."}
{"text":"Literally the best service I've had... At least that I can recall. We got the spinach and sun dried tomato dip as an appetizer which hit the spot. Buttermilk fried chicken  w/ corn and carbs #MashPotato which was def. the highlight to my belly. What I loved was even the waitresses/waiters that weren't serving us were still coming by and seeing them all working together to give customers the best service... Left me with a twinkle in my eye and the most satisfied stomach."}
{"text":"Service can be on and off, depends on who you get as your server.   Their food is quite good. They recently changed their menu for the winter, the beet caprese salad is really good. Also their pasta carbonara is really creamy.   Reservations are encouraged as they do quite busy during weekends."}
{"text":"Their brunch is okay, nothing notable but there aren't many places around that have great brunch - so it'll do for now!  They have lots of comfort food - can't really mess it up! The pizzas are so great for it's price on Mondays. $10 pizza! (Also, $1 corkage, so go have a pizza party to start the week off right.)  They have great service, all the servers as nice and friendly.   This place isn't that special, but in a town like Richmond Hill/Markham, it's worth a try. It's an easy choice. Not too expensive and reliable. Great for families as well."}
{"text":"The food is always fresh and we recommend the ribs, seafood salad, seafood pizza or any pizza!  Daily specials like half price bottles of wine and $10 pizza makes Smash a good weeknight dining option.   Manny and hostess / bar staff are always so welcoming and friendly as well as knowledgeable and helpful with the menu.   I've been here for lunch with the girls, brunch, drinks and apps with colleagues and dinner with friends and family. They also cater to children which is great for weekend brunche etc."}
{"text":"Brunch is a wonderful, fantastic thing. And the brunch at Smash lives up to those standards. Service was rocky to start but gradually improved. My bf was trying to get someone's attention for awhile (5-10 mins) but we were ignored by 3 different people even though we definitely made eye contact with them. When someone finally managed to track down our server (we had to ask twice before someone came), everything was fine after that. The food, as always, was very well done.   For a prix fix price of $20, you get a brunch entree, a dessert, and a tea/coffee. I thought this was a fantastic deal and while their portions were not the biggest for some items, I actually preferred it this way. Eggs benny were very rich, so I welcomed the more reasonable plating sizes (though a guy friend of mine did want more). The meatloaf looked quite large though, so that might be something to consider if you're extra hungry.   I got the crab cake eggs benny that came with a side of \"sm'hash browns\", which were essentially home fries. I thought it was all very delicious. The crab cakes were tasty and the hollandaise was a great accompaniment to it. The home fries were well seasoned, which is a bonus since side potatoes can be quite bland. A friend of mine was also very happy with the soup of the day (potato/bacon/cheddar).   For dessert, I got the fresh berries with whipped cream. Nothing special, but it was very refreshing after a heavy entree. Friends got the cheesecake, which had a nice caramel flavour. Some of us also got Sangrias, which were $5 on Sundays. They weren't very boozy, but had lots of fruits, which is the way I like it for brunch.   Smash is a great choice for comfort food and good quality. They deliver consistently and are reasonably priced for the food they serve. As mentioned in my previous review, service can be more attentive but once you do have their attention, things go pretty smoothly.  (41/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for a friend's birthday dinner. Their food arrived fairly quick for a large group of people! We ordered the chorizo pizza and smash burger. Both were really good. The server was extremely attentive and super friendly.. the champagne had to be cooled in their fridge for sometime and they gave it to us on the house! We will definitely come back. Thanks for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly when I walked in it was a very nice place inside. It was a Thursday and they didn't have a seat for me. I was alone tonight. They seated me in the bar which is ok. The service is great. I order the lobster pasta and it's a 3 star for me. The Pasta was little under cook for me. For the price it felt like a $$$ to me. I didn't felt full at all. The garlic bread was cold. I'm a kind of guy that love testing all the restaurant and recommend to others. I will try it again with my wife just because I didn't get a table for dinner. Let's hope it goes well next time. Nice place though."}
{"text":"Smash Kitchen and Bar offers a modern twist to American classics in a casual dining environment. A great brunch spot for Markham or if you want a break from the abundant Asian fare typical of the area.   FOOD Ordered their chicken and waffles for brunch. The Smash brunch menu offers classic brunch items like eggs benedict and omlettes, and has a $20 prix fix option that gives you one entree and a dessert with coffee or tea included. But I have a penchant for fried chicken and freshly made waffles, so I opted for the option that would best satify my craving -- and it did not disappoint. Both the chicken and waffle were done right. The fried chicken was lightly battered and fried to a light crisp with a nice golden exterior. On the inside, the light batter kept the chicken moist and cooked evenly throughout. The waffle carried a slight sweetness and was fluffy in texture, but firm enough to support the chicken on top. Both chicken and waffle were complimented by a citrus maple syrup that balanced the savory flavors from the chicken with the sweet flavors from the waffle. The vanilla butter was a nice touch but I only used it sparingly. There were also a few sprigs of lettuce added for visual contrast but really could have done without.  SERVICE My order was taken promptly and questions about the menu were answered swiftly. Food arrived at the table with no delays and waitstaff were very courteous. So much so that two different waiters and a manager came over to the table to ask how the food was. A little overeager to please but no complaints.  ENVIRONMENT Clean and welcoming, Smash Kitchen and Bar offers an open and spacious environment. There's plenty of seating in the dining area and at the bar. Restaurant is well-lit throughout with interesting light fixtures and several TVs for anyone to catch the game. Overall, Smash offers an inviting and casual dining experience.  WASHROOM Washrooms at Smash (at least for the gentleman's room) are kept clean and odour-free. Paper towels were kept in supply. No complaints on washrooms, though the urinal was a little close to the door."}
{"text":"I went into Smash Kitchen with high expectations. As a pescatarian, I already looked at the menu online to see what I could eat and decided to grab the Halloumi Salad.  I absolutely love Halloumi cheese after eating the Halloumi sandwich at Nandos.   However, I started with splitting an appetizer, the Seafood Crabcake, with my friend. We were given 2 medium sized portions of crab cakes (a steep price for $16).  And they were nothing to write home about. They came on a bed of arugula and had tartar sauce on the side.  The sauce was actually pretty good, but other than that, I wouldn't order this dish again.  The Halloumi Salad was also abysmal.  They breaded the cheese and deep fried it, so I expected something warm on the inside, but it was just a chunk of room temperature cheese.   The salad was made up of some more leafy greens, cucumbers and tomatoes.  I will not forget to mention that they really drenched the salad in a sour vinaigrette.  It was just a bit excessive and after a time, made me wince at the tartness.    I will say, however, that our waitress was exceptional.  We sat at the bar so she was taking our order as well as being the bartender.  She was still very attentive as our server and would check up on us the appropriate amount of times, without being overbearing.   Aside from the exceptional service, I don't normally have the best fokd experiences at Smash kitchen, and being even more limited now because of my dietary restrictions, I don't feel that I will come again."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for me. We ordered the burger and eggs florentine for lunch. Burger was very meaty which was great. Service was decent. Your typical average brunch restaurant."}
{"text":"Location: This restaurant is hidden away in the corner of a local Markham plaza.  Parking: not a problem! Plenty of space even on weekends.   Food:  Don't miss out on their weekend brunch because you'll really enjoy their chicken and waffles! I love that they also offer weekday specials ( Ie. Pizza night, burger night, etc). I usually order their butter milk fried chicken with the original sauce. They changed their menu with a new type of sauce but I just love their traditional gravy for the classic Southern fried chicken gravy they always had before. They are still very kind to allow me to request for the other sauce instead.   Wait and set up: They are really popular on the weekends for their brunch because there is often a lineup at the doorway for small groups. It usually doesn't take too long for a two person wait because you have the option of sitting at the bar as well.  Definitely recommend to call ahead for reservations for a bigger group.  They have secluded areas / private curtained areas if you would like to book a group, hold birthday parties or gatherings.   Love it and will keep coming back for the food"}
{"text":"Always friendly excellent service, never a let down.  Markhams hidden gem. Although my favourite meal is not on the new menu, I tried something new and loved it , have a new fav now.  Their Mac and cheese are delicious."}
{"text":"Buttermilk fried chicken was delicious.  The outer layer was crispy and the actual chicken was soft and tender.  The full rack of ribs was easy to cut and eat though some pieces were a bit dry.  Service was professional and very attentive.  Atmosphere was very good - this place is like a hidden gem as it's tucked away in the corner of a Plaza.   There was also a live pianist throughout the dinner.  The lady received a free gift (cupcake in a box) which was a nice touch.  This was probably due to valentine's day."}
{"text":"Fried chicken and waffle ain't crispy, quite soggy actually (even the non syruped parts). Crab cakes were mediocre. But At least they knew how to make an eggs benedict properly. How did this place get 4 stars I have no idea. First and last time coming here. Again, it seems like it's owned by a Chinese trying to sell white food.  No complaints on the service. But I what's the use of good service if the food is meh."}
{"text":"In a sea of Asian restaurants on highway 7, we find this gem of Canadian comfort food. We arrived for Tuesday lunch party of 8. Restaurant not busy but noticed 3 large groups of people including us. Mostly local business folks out for lunch. Server handled everyone effortlessly. We started with 4 appetizers share, pork ribs, naan bread with assorted dips, tuna tare tare salad and grilled calmari.  All good however the calamari tasted like it was from frozen. My main was steak and eggs cooked to order to a perfect medium rare. It always  surprises me when a restaurant cooks a perfect medium rare since so many don't get it get it right. The rib steak was excellent.   The one surprise is when everyone's main came out except for one person in our party. The manager came over apologized that they did not print the ticket and asked what he ordered. The manager offered a Cesar salad while he waited for his lamb shank 10 mins later it came out looking fresh and good but most importantly complimentary including the salad.   Great place we will be back"}
{"text":"This is a lovely venue, pleasing to the eye and comfortable   The staff are all lovely and very attentive   I ordered the full rack of ribs and to be honest I was disappointed and expected a better dish for the money  Ribs, mash and corn  Ribs were fall off the bone and tasty however true mash was a little cold as was the corn   Gf got the lobster Mac and the lobster was tiny!"}
{"text":"Do not order their fries. I repeat do not order their fries. Their fries are so soggy and dark brown, they are just not great. If you visit this place make sure you are willing to wait 30 mins for your food. I was expecting a lot more from their food, considering I waited for such a long time. The food is only decent for the amount you are paying for (4.5/10). If you want thin and crispy French fries, I guarantee you there will be better options."}
{"text":"Went fir a Sunday brunch. We were just looking for a place to eat & we were not disappointed at all! Their special is quite tasty"}
{"text":"Not bad for a local diner, I've been here in the past and it has definitely improved. I would actually rate this a 3.5, shy of a 4 due to the appetizer. I ordered the sun-dried tomato and spinach dip. When it came it was really burnt I was surprised they even served it. The corner of the dip was black and the pita was burnt as well. When you bite into the pita you can taste the charcoal which I should have taken back. For my main, I ordered the half rack and Mac which I really liked. The ribs fell off the bone and the Mac was just right (seasoning well and proportionate). It was a great combination and super filling. The service was great, a few different people came by to see how we were doing multiple times however I felt like it was a bit too much. Our server came at least 5 times which is greater than your average and seemed to be a bit pushy towards the end to give us the bill when the restaurant had plenty of space."}
{"text":"I've been to Smash twice now - seated once on the patio in the back last summer and once in the dining room.    I'd say it's a fairly classy establishment - similar in trendiness to Moxies/Joey's/Alice Fazooli's - where you can go for a classy dinner or just grab some brews and watch the game with your buddies.  Thus far, I've had the Lobster Mac and Cheese and the Mushroom Gnocchi. I recommend getting the Lobster Mac and Cheese - it's one of the more unique dishes on the menu and delivers. The Mushroom Gnocchi was good too, but nothing special. Look out for the specials too! My friend got a pizza lunch special for $10.00 - originally $17.00, I believe.  Smash is good, but not exceptional; pretty standard across the board.  It deserves 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on Friday. The service was great and the food-brisket and smash burger was even better. The sangria on a hot summer day  was really good as well."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon looking for some simple comfort food. We sat in the dining room, which had pretty dim lighting and was of moderate noise level. I am assuming it gets much louder in the evening since the bar section looked beautiful. This place has a really nice environment for a casual meal, yet would also be great for a fancy/classy celebration. I can even see myself planning a birthday dinner here!   The menu has several options to choose from including appetizers, salads, sandwiches, burgers, coal fired oven pizza, pasta, ribs, steak, etc. To our surprise, we were extremely satisfied with each of our dishes! Ahi Tuna Wontons ($14) was one of the more unique dishes that had lots of flavor and layers to it. There were however only 3 pieces, so I thought this item was a bit overpriced. Monster Burger ($18) was so juicy and delicious! One of the best burgers I've had in awhile, and the portion they give you is huge. I actually had to take half of this to-go, and am pretty excited to continue eating this later on tonight. Lobster Mac & Cheese ($22) tasted amazing as well, very saucy and cheesy!   The staff was attentive. Our server constantly came to check up on us, and as we were leaving, many workers gave us a friendly goodbye and a \"have a great day\" - I usually only hear this from my server or hostess, but it was nice to receive the kind words from everyone around.   Smash is certainly a decent place to have a bite!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. I had the fried chicken and sangria and while the sangria was too sweet to drink the food was good. For the price, I was a little disappointed but it was still good just not great. In the area it's a good option since there's not a ton of variety."}
{"text":"First time coming here, I will likely return to try some different menu items as there is an incredible amount of options to choose from.   We started with drinks. I had a strawberry mint mojito, my boyfriend had an old fashioned which were both well made and reasonably priced.   We started with the Ahi Tuna Wontons as recommended by a fellow yelper claiming they were the best, I was quite disappointed upon their arrival; 3 wontons lacking in flavour for A steep 14 bucks. We should've gone with our gut and ordered the poutine.   That aside the decor and ambience of the dining room is very nice. Spacious for gatherings and a bar with tvs making it versatile for all occasions. I'm hoping to return on a week night when they have some good looking specials.   Our mains arrived:   For my boyfriend: the monster burger.  They are not lying when they use this adjective. Nice large portion for the price and the sweet potato fries on the side were delicious.   For myself:  the Neptune Pizza  Fortunately I noticed a black hair in one of my pieces BEFORE consuming, and I really didn't feel like waiting for a whole other pizza so i just let the waiter know and he gave me a discount (a measly $4) for the trouble. Aside from that the pizza was delicious. The salmon was perfectly grilled and the flavours went together well.   Afterwards we had a few beers despite the abundance of fruit flies surrounding our plates and drinks which now makes me realize they probably don't clean their taps as often as they should.   All in all I'd like to go again and give this place a second chance but I'm a little worried I wont get my money's worth, I would still rather take that same money and spend it at Joey's."}
{"text":"After bookmarking this place for ages, I finally got a chance to try it out! Walking in on a Friday night (it was about 6:15pm), this place was already full, and we didn't make reservations...uh-oh. No worries, the waitresses were SUPER friendly and let us know that they do have a table, but we needed to clear the meal by 8pm. Of COURSE I'll finish by 8pm, that's a whole hour and forty-five minutes to eat!! We weren't planning for drinks either, so we took the table. It's rather nice of them though to approximate about (I'm assuming 2 hours) for their guests to dine.  Sitting down next to the window, the restaurant's ambience was dim lit, but still comfortable. Hoping for comfort food, we decided to go with the Chorizo Pizza ($14) and The Monster Burger ($18). HOLY MOLEY, the PORTIONS WERE MASSIVE. The Chorizo Pizza has an area the size of my printer and the Monster burger, great name for it, cause it was also massive. Not only were they massive, but they were delicious too! They were all cooked to a great temperature, the burger was juicy, the pizza was cooked just enough that the crust wasn't over the top crunchy, and the toppings were dry.   I think I'm going to come back next time for other items on their menu."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and each time I was not disappointed. The restaurant has more than enough parking in the lot, although you have to look for the entrance as it is in a corner of the plaza. The first time ever when we came here was for a friend's birthday so we were a large group so they gave us our own section in the restaurant. The other times we were just in the main dinning area. I find this restaurant is very comfortable and spacious. So even though you are in the main dinning area you still feel like you have some privacy with your party.  I find the food here delicious and a good range of choices to pick from too. The portions are also generous too.  Overall really like coming here for dinner."}
{"text":"I ordered a steak and potato meal and it was average I would say.  My steak was definitely undercooked, but overall the restaurant was good.  The mini donuts for dessert was the highlight of my meal!!!"}
{"text":"Was here with two groupons two months ago. Service was great and door was pretty good. They let use both of our groupon even though it says only allowed one group on per visit. We ended up with 3 appetizers 6 entrees and 3 desserts. It would've be a $300+ bill but we only had to pay tips and taxes so I think we ended up only paying $80. What a sweet deal!!  All the entrees were delish and desserts were amazing. Will consider going back."}
{"text":"came here for lunch with a group of friends it was pretty packed and we asked for outdoor sitting which we got. the restaurant is very pretty perfect for chilling with friends or to go on a date. everything looks elegant love it  the food arrived pretty quickly and looked very appealing  the chorizo pizza was $17 and had spinach chorizo sausage goat cheese and more. the crust was thing like I liked it and they gave olive oil and chilli peppers. the pizza was pretty good but I wasn't too fond of the taste from the goat cheese. 3.5/5   we also got the la Mac and cheese and it was very cheesy and creamy. one of the best I've hadn't SO YUMMY 5/5 it is $15 for small and $19.5 for the large however small is a pretty decent size since Mac and cheese is filling   The truffle Mac and cheese was also good but not as good as the la. it had a prominent truffle taste and was more creamier but the same cheesiness 4/5  also got a salad but don't remember the name. it had a lemony vinaigrette. pretty typical wouldn't get again cause didn't stand out but I like the cucumbers just average but pretty expensive 3/5  overall it was a very nice atmosphere and the service was exceptional. they checked up on us and refilled our waters quickly. would definitely come back but the price tag is pretty high so only once in a while"}
{"text":"Came here for our anniversary dinner on a Tuesday night and was surprised as the place was busy! I recognized Bonnie from Yelp too as she greeted us and took us to our table :)  Tip: make sure to make a reservation for dinner.  First impression: Amazing service! Very cozy!  So we ordered the garlic cheese bread as appetizer and got it in like 5 minutes. Wow that was fast. The garlic cheese bread could use more cheese, really. But over all not bad.  So we placed our 'mains' order and was again surprised as the food came in like 5 minutes! Definitely not what I expected! So that was great, as I was really hungry at the time.  I got the buttermilk fried chicken with bread and corn and was impressed by the serving size, but not too impressed by the taste. I find the corn to be really spicy, and definitely not what I expected. But over-all not bad. I regret not getting the LA Mac and Cheese but I will definitely get that next time I come here.  My BF got Chicken and Ribs and he was also surprised at the serving size he can't even finish the meal! But he enjoyed it still and found the food really tasty.  Over all I would go back for sure to try other dishes. And I am coming back because I was pleased with the service as well."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always a hit and never disappoints. The menu is larger and has a variety of options from salads to burgers to a section dedicated to mac and cheese. The salad was a big portion so it was actually filling. The service was good as well. This place is almost always packed so make a reservation! The only downside is it is a little pricey."}
{"text":"I've heard sooooo many positive things about this restaurant... and they are totally worth the hype!!! Service is an 11/10. The staff are extremely nice and polite and made sure we had everything we needed, it's rare to find this especially on a Friday night!   We had the half rack ribs and chicken (super yum!) and the bbq brisket grilled cheese sandwich. The portions are HUGE! Be prepared to be very full or take home some left overs"}
{"text":"Third visit.  Came across the Monday special, which was $10 pizzas (applied for all pizzas). Ordered the Pride of Nova Scotia (originally $19) & Chorizo (originally $14). I really enjoyed the Chorizo, as it was full of flavour yet not to spicy. As for the Pride of Nova Scotia, it was really tasteful with big pieces of lobster - they weren't skimping on the ingredients at all. I'm  normally not a seafood fan, but I really enjoyed it.  This restaurant is definitely a place to go for lunch/dinner, especially with their daily deals.    Cons: (otherwise would've given them 4 stars) - The pizza came at room temperature but they were still delicious  - The server was somewhat rude as I felt they kept on rushing us for the bill even though they were not busy at all"}
{"text":"I think this restaurant is between $$ and $$$ dollar signs depending on how elaborate of a meal you want to have.  If you want to have a starter, entree, and dessert, it would surely between $35-45 dollars per person.  Maybe if you split the starter and dessert, you could get it closer to $30.  With that being said though, Smash Kitchen Bar is a great experience for small or large group dining experience.  You can come here for a nice sit-down meal with some friends or catch the sports game with the strategically placed TVs around the restaurant.  In my case, I did both.  We came on a Sunday evening for dinner and I really liked the ambience running through the restaurant.  There was a good mix of people that were here to catch a game from the NFL opening weekend or just for a family/friend meal out.  The service staff are friendly and attentive.  I was really impressed with the service staff when they came over and asked \"How are the first few bites?  Is there anything not to your liking that we can re-make?\" (paraphrasing a bit).  One of our table mates did mention that their protein in the southern chicken lettuce wrap was a little dry and nary a peep, they whisked the dish away and came back with a new one that was to their satisfaction.    This blew me away because normally you never find a service staff that asks the second part to that quote above and then they followed through like champs.  That is 5-star service right there and you know the restaurant has the customer's experience at the very top of their list.  There is a wide variety of items to satiate any burger, pizza, ribs, mac and cheese, or other craving that may occur while browsing the not too overwhelming but just enough choice menu.  The menu seems to change from time to time which is great to keep people coming back.  After taking a long hard look, I went for the warm steak salad because I have to run a marathon in a month so maybe I will treat myself to the buttermilk chicken and ribs after that!  I was really impressed when the salad arrived at the table.  The 4oz sirloin steak was cooked rare as I requested and it was laid on top of a large healthy portion of spinach, kale accompanied by candied pecans, bacon, caramelized onions, blue cheese, grape tomatoes, and fingerling potatoes.  The salad tasted every bit as good as it looked and I almost never order salads at a restaurant.  Everything on the plate just worked together.  My only little niggle is that the salad was a little too over dressed with the dressing for my preference but that did not take away from the overall dish.  My YEA (Yelp Elite Assistant) got the Poseidon pizza which was loaded with tiger shrimp, lobster, and bacon among other toppings looked very appetizing as well!  It was very much enjoyed.  At the end of the meal, it wasn't any trouble for them to do split bills because their POS system and the service staff can easily handle it which was the cherry on top for me.  Highly enjoyed my experience here and would come back when another opportunity presents itself.  Cheers Smash Kitchen Bar!"}
{"text":"This is an upscale trendy casual restaurant. The food was better than I thought. The BBQ Ribs were tender flavourful. Smash Burger was soooo delicious. It also came with a side ( we chose the roasted tomato corn soup). It was amazing. We also had grilled calamari for appetizer. Cream brûlée and raspberry sorbet for dessert. We had an awesome dinner & a tasty experience. Already made a reservation for next week."}
{"text":"The buttermilk fried chicken is fantastic! I had it with a side of the LA mac and cheese, and the combination is superb. The chicken is crispy, flavourful and juicy. It is a little bit on the expensive side. We had one server that was quite vibrant, and another who didn't seem as vibrant. But nonetheless, the service was good."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with my brunch experience at Smash. Decent food, good service, good portions, and decent price. Large seating area, so didn't have to wait even during prime noon hour.   The crab cake benedict was good, although I found the crab cakes themselves had too much filler and a little soggy. Also, they had some jalapeño salsa on top, which made it a little spicy for me.  The meatloaf skillet was quite nice. A little dense (with again a little too much filler), but still tasty. Especially liked the bacon wrapped around it.   Would have been nice to order items off their main menu (wanted to try their pizza), but was told only brunch menu until after 2 pm.   Will be back to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Love this local run restaurant!  The food is tasty with some interesting items.  We especially like the firecracker shrimp.  The kids' menu grilled cheese is a favourite too amongst kids as it is more like a garlic bread with cheese!  They use real cheese too.  The wait staff is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp and decided to try it out with a friend since we were hungry and in the area.  We sat on the patio which was unfortunately quite small and didn't have any view. (There were very tall wooden fences boxing the patio) the waiter was very friendly though, but he got my order wrong. I had ordered the lobster mac n cheese instead for the angry lobster. I didn't realize until I had taken a bite of my meal, but luckily after I asked about it, he still charged me for my original meal which was cheaper.  Food wise, everything was great, the portions were decently sized, and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and fun atmosphere. A pleasure to have in Markham. Food is always delicious and prices reasonable. Occasionally service is week, many times if they are busy, servers or bartenders forget to make drinks, bring appetizers or simply forget when you ask for something like cutlery, ketchup etc.. All in all a nice place to take the family for a good quality  meal."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday brunch and the nice server asked if we wanted to sit in a shared table vs waiting 45 mins for our own table.  We took the shared table and unlike some other places, the seating was quite spacious between the parties so we did not feel like we were sharing...frankly many restaurants with your own tables seat you closer to your neighbours.  We chose the $20 price fix menu items where we got main, coffee and dessert.   The eggs Benedict were perfectly prepared and the home fries was not greasy.  What more can I say but the food was good and the service was excellent.     I'm so surprised we did not come here before considering I drive by it all the time.   Definitely will be back for brunch.    One extra comment is why don't you have a lunch menu or brunch available for the weekdays or Sat?"}
{"text":"As I was reviewing my Yelp reviews, I was surprised that I had not reviewed Smash Kitchen sooner. We have been going there from time to time for years and the restaurant has come a long way from its beginnings, when my cousin was a chef there and helped conceptualize some of the classic menu items like the Neptune pizza, bbq chicken salad, and chicken and ribs combos. To this day these are still some of my favourite menu items. I also LOVE the banana cake which we order every time we go there.  The restaurant is spacious and has a few areas where larger parties could be accommodated (we held our wedding rehearsal dinner here a few years back). The staff are pretty friendly and attentive. They have a small patio which is nice to sit out on during warmer weather.  If you're looking for a great place to come hang out with friends, or go to brunch with family, or simply a place to stop by for a drink, dinner or dessert, Smash Kitchen is definitely a place to consider.  (48/100)"}
{"text":"Definitely a date night place for sure but also a chic small group dinner place.  I had chicken carbonara and my person had LA Mac and cheese. That Mac smelled amazing!  The carbonara had great flavour and seasoning, though a tad pricey for what it's worth. Grilled chicken breast was filling and they sliced it up but I still cut it up in smaller pieces. Not juicy, but not dry. I'd say it was ok.  What pulled this to a 4 was the pasta and just the general flavour of the dish. It wasn't overly salty nor overwhelming. Although not a fan of vegetables, the spinach helped complicate the flavours and made it interesting.  Service was meh though. Maybe it's because we were the only table in a little room but it took a while to get someone over.  If the flavour was average, my review would have been a 3."}
{"text":"This place really has gone downhill. Raised prices, lowered quality. Add bad service on top and you get Smash kitchen."}
{"text":"I love their dessert the flourless chocolate cake! It comes with 2 bars then a sorbet n a little bit of fruits"}
{"text":"3.5/5 with no rounding up unfortunately.  Meal was brunch with the boyfriend last weekend. We decided to loaft and came here around 2. Luckily their kitchen was available for dining as other groups arriving after us were still served. +1 for accommodating beyond your posted time.  There wasn't a wait for patio seating, and 80% of the tables were full with diners. Our server was quick to attend to us, and filled our water glasses promptly. Having passed the lunch rush, she was most certainly attentive, and happy to answer any questions we had. I got the eggs benny with salmon, and BF got the meatloaf on a skillet. Mimosa was good, and was made with freshly squeezed OJ. Delish.  They do have a brunch Prix Fixe where for a few dollars more, you have a choice of drink, and dessert.  One gripe I had was the food quality. The hash browns weren't made from real potatoes, but instead I know they are supplied by a food services company ): May come back for their chicken and waffles"}
{"text":"I swear all y'all boosted this so much that what I experienced turned out to be a great disappointment.  I went in and stood for a few min and absolutely NOBODY helped us- there were people at the front but they looked at us and looked away. OKAY, COOL. Our friends that were already there eventually saw us and waved us over but nice to know you hire such attentive staff!!  I was not feeling super hungry and I only had the soup of the day: chicken corn chowder? When it came, it was in a super small bowl (with large edges - to give the effect that there's a lot?) the soup was super salty, to the point where I was taking 3 gulps of water per one spoonful. Also, there was 2 pieces of chicken in there. Awesome.  My friend had the lychee martini and apparently it tastes like cough syrup.. My other friend had the lobster pasta and apparently the lobster was miniscule. However, my other friends enjoyed their meals and drinks.  The server we had was alright, she was friendly and came back to check on everything so yay for that.   Other than that.. this is an overpriced restaurant for mediocre food. I like the atmosphere, it's nice and dark with kind of a modern muskoka feel. I don't feel like it will ever get 5 stars from me, like all the other raving reviews I see on here. Super disappointed. I'll come one more time to try more food- if this is the current review you see, that means my mind didn't change."}
{"text":"Finally came here after passing it by so many times and eyeing it.  I went on a Saturday morning for their brunch menu (Sat & Sun, 9am-2pm) - prix fix at $20 (optional), it includes one entree, one dessert, and a coffe or a tea.  However, after finishing my crab cakes benedict ($15 on its own), I opted out of the prix fix because I was too full from the entree and coffee (free refills!).   The crab cakes benedict comes with two poached eggs, crab cakes, hollandaise, pico de gallo, sm'hash browns and a bit of fruit (honeydew, pineapple, orange). While it was super filling, the taste didn't wow me as much I expected it to - the crab cakes were pretty good in flavour but everything was all a bit over-cooked - not to the point where I couldn't finish the meal, but enough that I didn't eat with my usual zeal.  My friend ordered their garden omelette ($13 alone, three eggs, peppers, onions, tomato, mushrooms, spinach, four cheese blend, sm'hash browns, toast, and a little bit of fruit) and she was satisfied and definitely full at the end.   Despite my slightly over-done meal, I'd definitely come here again - there are many delicious-sounding options plus the atmosphere is great - modern but homey, service is friendly and frequent, and there's plenty of seating. Brunch fills up really quick - while I didn't make reservations, I got lucky enough that I got seats a few minutes after I arrived - I recommend you definitely make reservations if you come for their brunch or for dinner time. Smash is a great place for good food and good conversations - we sat there for hours until the place slowly emptied and left happy."}
{"text":"Smash kitchen and bar is a fantastic contemporary restaurant for classic comfort food! I highly recommend going!  This was my second visit. The first time I ordered the lobster mac n cheese which I wasn't too fond of due to the heaviness of the dish. I liked the concept of the restaurant too much to not give it a second shot and I'm glad as I had a much better experience this time around. I would definitely visit again!  I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken as it was highly recommend by our waitress. I was a bit hesitant as I thought it would be too heavy but it wasn't! The fried chicken was nice and crisp, and was well contrasted with the sweetness of the corn and biscuit. It was also boneless which was awesome, hands free fried chicken! The sausage gravy was creamy and brought everything together. Typically, I must absolutely have ketchup with my fried chicken but didn't need to this time around. It was that good.   My friend ordered the pride of Nova Scotia pizza and it was delicious. I love thin crust coal fired pizza and this was just as good as the authentic Italian pizzas. There was a perfect amount of cheese and the pizza was neither dry nor gooey. However, it was slightly on the salty side and could do with some more lobster. Do expect to share this unless you're super hungry! Tip: Try asking your waitress for chili flakes and a drizzle of olive oil!  The ambience of the restaurant was nice and cozy albeit a tad too dark and noisy, but that is expected from bar types of restaurants.   The service was great as our waitress was attentive and gave us great recommendations. We were well taken of! I liked the fact that they provided us a bottle of water so we didn't need to flag down someone for a refill. In addition, checking into yelp gives you 10% off the bill, just how awesome is that?!  Make sure to reserve well in advance; I called to reserve a table for a table of two at 6:30 and the earliest time available was at 8:40."}
{"text":"Delish. Nicely done steaks. My sis had the ribs and liked 'em. Definitely a nice comfort food place as advertised. Plentiful portions. Our server, Manny, was so lovely and sweet. Made us Chicagoans in a foreign land feel quite welcome. And the Brett's LP drink was very cool and fantastic! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Came here for both dinner and brunch. It's a good place for a Canadian/American style meal uptown in Markham and a great brunch option besides Cora's in the area.  For dinner I had the Neptune pizza with shrimp and smoked salmon ($17) The serving was large I had to take a quarter of it home. The crust was thin and crispy when it came the way I liked it, and it came with a good amount of toppings. The service was a bit slow that night but bearable.   For brunch I tried the chicken and waffles (not many places uptown has it so I had to try!) The chicken thighs were moist and crispy on the outside and they were de-boned so it was meaty every bite with none of the work! The waffle was good and not dense and the citrus syrup was also great to moisten the waffle but could be a more spicy. They give waaaaayyyy too much of the vanilla butter - it was a large scoop i used maybe 1/16th of it and the vanilla taste was a bit odd for myself personally.   Can back a second time for brunch on a Sunday, and got the crab cake Benedict - it was a very large portion and very filling with potatoes and a fruit skewer. The 2 crab cakes were really good and actually had lump crab meat inside with a crispy outside, topped with poached eggs, wish it came with a little more hollandaise sauce and pico de gallo   The brunch service was good the waiter was friendly at times a bit awkward, but was great. My friend ordered the veggie omelette and the wrong one came out but replaced it for her right away. Would definitely come back again especially for brunch. They do get booked up though, tried going once for lunch and the whole place was rented out for a wedding, another time for dinner for a large birthday party."}
{"text":"THIS IS MY FAVORITE BRUNCH GO TO IN MARKHAM!!!   I have been coming to this place periodically at least twice (maybe once a week) for about 2 months now. I have never been disappointed by the food or the excellent staff!  The Tomato corn soup is a favorite! its my go to pick me up. The pulled pork grilled cheese is also to die for.   I am definitely  going back again for more brunches to come."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with my husband and child.  We live in the area and always say we should go, but never do.  I'm glad I finally went - I think I was missing out on some good food.  My rating is a 3.5, but without the option to give halfsies, I rounded up.  Let's start with the bad part:  The hostess was a complete dip.  She was seriously lacking in tact.  We show up at 5:30pm on a Saturday, no reservation.  The place was empty.  You could hear a pin drop.  She looks at the computer and informs us that she can give us a table without a reservation, but we'd have to vacate in a hour.  WHAT?  My husband and I were just kind of flabbergasted.  Either you send us away without a reservation, or you give us a table.  Her strategy of being completely unwelcoming and a bit of a douchebag, it rubbed me the wrong way.  I guess I was giving the blank stare/WTF-face for too long b/c she finally said, \"well, maybe you can have an hour and a half\".    We took the table b/c the way I see it, once I start ordering drinks and food, it will take a complete baffoon/jerk to ask a customer to leave.  So, that's what we did.  WIne, beers, apps, mains, dessert.  We took our time.  No one asked us to leave, b/c, why would they???  So, dear management, teach your hostess some tact and customer service.  If the food wasn't good, I would say that I wouldn't return.  On to the food.  We ordered:  Louisiana Croquettes - very good.  So crispy, warm in the middle, just the right amount of spice, and the sauce was very good.  Loved this app.  BBQ chicken salad - perfectly dressed.  Avocado and crispy wonton strips were a nice touch.  I would order this again.  As good as it was, it was $16, which seemed like a bit of a rip off.    LA mac and cheese - The cheese sauce was so good, it probably had 1 stick of butter in it.  the cheese melted on top was nothing special (ched/mozza blend - kind of bland).  It was unnecessary.    Margarita pizza (no tomatoes) - good thin crust pizza.  Nothing special, but really well done.  SImple ingredients and thus, very tasty.  Monster burger + fries - I like that the fries are made in house.  Thank you for no frozen fries!  The burger was big, juicy and delicious.  Beef is ground in house, I believe, which is key.  It was so big that my husband couldn't eat it in hand.  He tried, but eventually settled for a knife and fork.   Dessert - strawberries and cream donuts.  Good, but for $11, we got ripped off.    The prices are a bit weird.  Some stuff is priced well, others things are priced way out there.  A skillet of noodles and cheese should not be $9 or $11 or whatever it was.  Same with the donuts.  $11 for 6 donut holes??? get out of here.     Our waiter, Manny, was AWESOME.  Really nice guy who was attentive but not annoying.  The GM or owner paid a visit to our table, which was a nice touch.  He was very nice and welcoming.  Upon arrival, the bartender heckled my husband for wearing a Sens jersey, which was funny.  So, the staff is great (minus dumb hostess).    I would go back.  There is more food that I'd like to try.  A good place to visit if you don't want frozen crap or basic dishes.  They had the classics (burgers, pizza, meat + potatoes), but there was some good variation with ingredients and etc."}
{"text":"Had dinner with wife & kids (yes not wives and kid :) for our anniversary. It was our first time here.   Big parking lot in the plaza was maybe 75% full but it seems only Smash is the only establishment open :).  Noise level is medium and can still hear each other.   Food: (sorry don't have exact names) Smash pizza - very flavorful, sprinkled ground beef on top Beef ribs (from special dinner menu - those one pager) - oh my,  beef was falling off the bone. So tender. The rice with mushrooms (risotto?) that came with it was perfect.  Lobster mac and cheese - as expected for a mac and cheese Shrimp appetizer - quite good / just a small serving of maybe 5-6 pcs Dessert - complimentary one (Smash's anniversary gift) - with the little donut holes, a sparkler on top and cake (brownie/chocolatey). My wife loved the cake. I felt it was too sweet for me.   Very good experience. Servers were so cordial and were what you'd expect from \"great customer service\". They do try to delight their customers.   By the way I called 2 days back to book a Saturday 6pm but they booked me on a Friday instead. Glad the gentleman handing the front was able to find us seat rather quickly. So their mistake was of course quickly forgotten and forgiven. :)"}
{"text":"I think I'm slowly returning to bi-weekly visits here. Their brunch is probably the best in Markham and if you go on a Sunday the Sangria is the special as well at only $6 per glass! They've taken the time to truly craft a beautiful glass of wine, fruit and juice. It's a pretty strong drink and the wine flavour really comes out in each glass. I'm not a sangria drinker nor wine drinker but I will return for theirs!"}
{"text":"Just ate it here for brunch today. Overall the food was good. At my table we ordered smash chicken and waffles, meatloaf skillet, smash Benedict, and crab cakes Benedict. For the eggs Benedict, we ordered the crab cakes Benedict with soft eggs and the smash Benedict with medium, but they mixed up the eggs and I ended up with soft eggs when I ordered medium eggs. I didn't say anything just because typically when I go to restaurants if they make a mistake I don't complain. This could be just because I never know what restaurants might do when they take back the food. The service in the beginning was good but as it got busier the service for our table was slow and we were waiting a while to get waitress. But other then that food was good and liked the decor and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I finally got to try Smash this past Sunday after hearing so many good reviews on it. My boyfriend and I came for brunch around 12pm and it was packed. Good thing we had reservations so were seated pretty quickly.  Service was great - our waitress was very nice, friendly and attentive. She gave us some recommendations on the brunch menu and was very helpful and informative.  I ordered the Chicken & Waffles ($17), which I was really excited about because it was my first time trying it. I was not disappointed. The chicken was nicely deep fried and had a nice layer of crispy skin that wasn't too thick and oily. The waffle itself was a bit dense, but that wasn't a problem when I ate it together with the chicken. The spicy citrus maple syrup also gave it a nice kick. My only recommendation would be to share this dish with someone and eat it first before it gets soggy.  My boyfriend really enjoyed his Meatloaf Skillet ($16), which came with 2 eggs, bacon weaved meatloaf, sm'hash browns, bell peppers and caramelized onions. The meatloaf was very flavorful and moist. The potatoes were also cooked very nicely - crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  Overall we enjoyed our food and experience at this restaurant. We'd definitely come back again! =)"}
{"text":"Had brunch here: ordered the Eggs Florentine and Crab Cake Eggs Benedict, both dishes were alright, although personally I was looking for more flavour and value if I was to pay around $17 per person for  brunch. Overall verdict: too expensive."}
{"text":"brunch is amazing. i also had lunch once. definately would visit again in near future."}
{"text":"Excellent service. I didn't know weekend was limited to brunch menu and had my eye out for the ahi tuna salad. Kitchen was nice enough to specially prepare that for me and it was delicious. Also tried their chicken and waffles, met expectations although still not as great as places that specialize in fried chicken and waffles such as the Dirty Bird. Overall, we had a nice brunch and would definitely come back again to try other items."}
{"text":"Ordered ribs and chicken with lobster mac and cheese and caprese salad for two of us. We went there as a group of 10, and the server was very friendly and helpful. Buffalo mozzarella was freshly made in house. I might be biased since I love caprese salad, but this was definitely one of the best ones I have had. Beets give the hint of sweetness as well.  Ribs were tender and moist, and mac n cheese was creamy. Such a satisfying meal! We wanted to order a dessert to share, but we were just too full. Their dessert menu sounded good too! Hope I get to go soon to try some of them.  Overall, good ambience, solid food, and friendly service!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favourite restaurants for dinner in York Region. We've had a hard time finding good restaurants in our area so we tried Smash because it popped up on my OpenTable app. They are no longer on OpenTable.  Normally I have the grilled calamari to start which is AMAZING!!! The seasoning is peppery and delicious. For dinner I usually get the lobster mac and cheese...it used to be so yummy and more like a rosé sauce with lots of cheese and a half tail and a claw plus some smaller pieces of lobster in it. We went the for Fathers Day and were very disappointed that the quality declined significantly...dry pasta as though it sat under a heat lamp too long and barely any lobster meat. Huge bummer.  Note - I would not recommend the angry lobster pasta...it lacks the \"wow\" the Mac and cheese has.  Pros:  Sometimes amazing food Good value  Relaxed casual atmosphere  Good service - normally 2 servers per table and the manager will usually come by to ask how things are going Clean restaurant  Lots of parking Online reservations   Cons:  Small patio - feels cramped Some areas of the restaurant are quite dark Curb appeal - it's in an older plaza on Highway 7 and doesn't do the interior atmosphere justice.  Food quality isn't what it used to be   We will still go back, but it's no longer one of our faves :("}
{"text":"Not bad service. Not bad food. Just a bit noisy. Probably would go back but not order anything with bread. One of us didn't finish their biscuits with their meal because it got soggy in no time. My burger fell apart instantly because the bottom bun sogged up so I ended up using my knife and fork."}
{"text":"What a gem! I've passed by Smash several times but the bad location (located in a strip mall next to a Vet clinic) has always deterred me from going. Boy was I mistaken! Their brunch is probably the best Markham has to offer!  On my first visit I had their steak and eggs benedict with their fab gravy instead of hollandaise sauce and it was fantastic. I love their twist on traditional dishes, it adds a bit of creativity and fun to their menu. On my second visit I had their Smash Burger and that was absolutely delicious (I'm a sucker for a Brisket burger). Wish I had enough room to try their mini donuts!   The vibe of the restaurant is kind of sports bar-y but classier (without the pretentiousness). The staff was very friendly and down to earth. Food prices are a tad bit on the expensive side but what can you expect food prices have been on the rise for awhile now. Smash is definitely trying to compete in the JOEY market and I do think they can with a little more promo. Both my experiences at Smash were flawless and I'm definitely on my way to becoming a regular."}
{"text":"Food was excellent, the mac and cheese is unexpectedly sweet so just a heads up, but it was still great.  4 stars because we made a reservation for 7 and they still squished us into a table for 6 people, the restaurant wasn't even packed when we ate so no reason to sit uncomfortably."}
{"text":"didn't know there was such a place in markham until i was searching for brunch place nearby. have been here for lunch and dinner before. What we ordered are good, taste and the look are good. The portion is good as well. There's special for every night and will definitely go and try more food."}
{"text":"I smashed at their kitchen last saturday, a fine sunny morning.  The environment is very comfortable and cozy, I felt good and relaxed as soon as i walked in. The sunlight was coming in, their decor is nice and classy with the bar being in the middle of the restaurant, it just looks like a lot of thought went into placing everything. I was eyeing a table by the window, it looked so good with the sun coming in, but couldn't get it because it was reserved :-S so we were seated on the white bar table which is seperate from the alcohol bar itself.  Therefore, if you wanna sit on a good spot, reserve the tables before going in, this place is very popular on weekend mornings.  Service was nice, the server explained the deal to us ($20 for a three course brunch) and the food came pretty quickly as well.  Food, I got chicken and waffle (I just can't get past it if i see it on the menu), my SO ordered the smash burger (I told her its famous on yelp lol). The chciken and Waffle was the best i have had after White brick, which is quite a compliment. The waffle was freshly baked, so it was warm and soft, the chicken was fried perfectly and it came with a citrus sauce which went well with the food. The burger was pretty decent, considering it is not a burger joint, but since i have had sooo many great burgers, i can't say i would try the burger again.  TL;DR - Great environment, busy on weekend mornings and good food. Reserve your spot before going."}
{"text":"GTA YELP! meet and greet at Smash Kitchen was quite eventful!  This place used to be Bluestone Bistro, but Smashed is here to stay! The decor, and overall atmosphere has an intimate, yet fun surrounding aura.  The service was excellent! props to both Jason the manager, the bartender, and kick a$$ stone oven pizza that was dishing gourmet goodness. Both my guest and I had SANGRIAs all evening, perfect balance of citrus fruits and wine! However i should have tried their Ceasar which received praiseful review, and yes I decided to stick to Sangria, sorry Steam Whistle guys, I did NOT want to mix my alcohol.   Gourmet pizza: 5/5; bbq flavored, with chicken and corn, perfect balance of flavor, and it was gourmet thin crust! gone are the days of thick dough. Their pepperoni was another popular item, which i give the same 5/5  Chicken Wings: 5/5 unlike those small wings, Smash has some decent sized wings packed with saucey flavor, thank goodness napkins were well in stock!   Calamari: 4/5 it was great, but again not a big fan of calamari, and though it was fried, it wasnt oily! a big plus!  Smash Burger: 5/5!!! hands down, packed to the max meat burger oozing with cheese, was the perfect comfort food experience! probably one of the most juiciest burgers I've had in a while!  Definitely coming back here! though its tough to see off Highway 7, its a jem tucked away!!"}
{"text":"5/5  My previous rating remains the same. GREAT service and amazing food. This time I had the warm quinoa salad with seared rare tuna. I was here for a work lunch (8 people) and they were able to take reservations a few days before, and seat us immediately upon arrival. We were in and out within an hour... usually not the case at other restaurants!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our dinner last last night.  Nice decor which was unexpected for a restaurant in a strip mall in the burbs on Highway 7. The menu was diverse, contemporary and the food was great.  Service was very attentive- perhaps too attentive with the servers and others popping by every few minutes making sure we had everything and were happy with the meal. I got the impression this may have been mandated by management as it came from three different staff members.  Hopefully the staff will find the balance between being available and not constantly interrupting their guests' conversations.  If so, they'll get 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Smash has become one of my favourite restaurants in Markham. The chicken and waffles, surf and turf, and pride of nova scotia pizza, Mac and ribs are all very good. One of my favourite parts of smash is that they have different feature dishes every day. They also have $1 corkage fee on Mondays :) Anyways, I'm excited for their patio to open..its been long overdue!"}
{"text":"Went here for Saturday brunch with my parents. We did not have a reservation so we had to wait for a table to open up. The wait wasn't too bad, about 10 minutes. Our server was welcoming and polite, and managed to be attentive although he was very busy at the bar and with other tables.   For food, we ordered the Smash burger, the crab cake Benedict, and the chicken and waffles. The burger was...a burger lol the crab cakes were to die for but the home fries were a little hard for my liking, and the chicken and waffles were decent...could have used a touch more butter and maybe extra syrup on the side. Half way through our meals, we all were surprisingly full and had everything packed up for take out.  I would definitely recommend Smash for their weekend brunch, just make sure you call ahead to avoid waiting."}
{"text":"This place has great options for brunch. The Crab Cake Benedict is really good. You can't go wrong getting the chicken and waffles. And the garden omelette is... very healthy tasting ^^  Their hash browns are really crispy and addicting. Don't overlook dessert! Most of all their good service is what I'll remember the most. Highly recommend this place~"}
{"text":"there aren't very many good brunch spots north of Toronto and i much rather just head downtown for brunch, so it took me a while to pay Smash a visit. i've heard from my friends that it's very comparable to the places downtown, with their chicken & waffles being a signature! we walked in and was told there would be a 30 min. wait and they're always booked full on the weekends. luckily i insisted they find somewhere to squeeze us and we would be very happy sitting at the bar.   eggs benny with smoked salmon, just my go-to for brunch, never a disappointment. for some reason, i was craving a club sandwich or what i thought would've been one. after about 10 minutes and us trying to wave the server down.  i ordered a latte and their canadian club, while my friend ordered a hot chocolate and the eggs florentine - we also ordered a waffle on the side. our drinks never came, rather the food came i believe in 10-15 minutes, we were impressed, especially since we were starved. the potatoes 'sm'hash browns' were PILED and i mean my entire plate surrounding my sandwich was covered with potatoes! with such generous portions, i can see why everyone is so pleased. my friend enjoyed her eggs florentine very much - i on the other hand did not enjoy my order. i probably should've said something ... or read that the club wasn't actually a club sandwich, it just a sandwich 'piled high peameal bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, honey mustard' .. because the peameal bacon was so stacked .. i mean 4 slices thick, it made it exhausting to eat and very dry. i ate half.   on the side note, we already asked for the server to follow-up on our drinks, they never came. i just didn't want to seem a nuisance so didn't mention me not enjoying my order. instead, we split our waffle, which by the way was GREAT! it came out the same time as our food so after 20 minutes of sitting there, it was still very crispy and i was slightly more content afterwards. while eating my waffle, the manager came by so i asked to cancel our drinks, we were finishing up by now. if you haven't gathered at this point, i did not care for our server. we basically did not exist to her.  he came back to apologize and said he gave us 25% our meals, which i completely unexpected and really appreciated the gesture. the server finally came by to ask if we needed anything .. at the end of the meal. she never asked when we first got our food or to check up on us. but there were 2 guys who sat down right next to us and she definitely served them, asking how their food was, if they needed anything .. we were just invisible.  when she saw we finished she cleaned up .. i had still a half of the sandwich (just couldn't really have the rest) and a lot of potatoes left. she asked if i wanted to pack it, i stated i did not enjoy it at all. nothing. no response, she said oh and took it away, that's it. no response.  now .. i didn't expect her to say oh let me comp. that meal or anything, just even an oh i'm sorry to hear that, something? i literally could've served myself better than the job she did. if not for the manager being so nice, i definitely would've left without tipping her, which i actually regret even tipping her at all. needless to say, NEVER sit at the bar although, if she's in the dining room and my server again .. i would just leave. i should find her name on my receipt.   note to management - do not put slow or new or BAD servers at the bar. she clearly could not handle herself or her 3/4 pairs of guests she had. it's not even as if she had to run around, she stayed at the bar, made drinks and served them, if she even did. she had no sense of what to do first and what was more urgent. for example: when we asked to take our orders, she proceeded to take her time to look for a machine to close a tab, wait for it to be done (by the way they were 2 steps over over) then 5 mins later, come back to take our order. she could've easily taken our orders while waiting for the customer to enter their pin. i do hope that if/when i return, the service will be .. service.   again, i did really appreciate the manager (so i think he was) and what he did. but it definitely did not make up for the experience overall - especially with all these raving 5 star reviews."}
{"text":"I tried to check in here but somehow it wasn't working properly.. oh well.. bought a groupon and tried it with some friends..And I was quite impressed per say...  We ordered:  caprese salad, smash burger, baby back ribs, BBQ ribs and chicken...   Caprese Salad was a great starter.. bocconcini with tomato...  Smash burger was juicy and delicious...2 thick patties..packed with tomatoes, lettuce and i think its mayo...   Baby backed ribs is sooo soft.. falls off the bone delicious..loved the BBQ sauce... corn and mashed potatoes were a perfect combo...  Chicken was a little too dry for my taste buds...   Great decor, service is quite detailed, comfortable seating.."}
{"text":"I first ordered the Parmesan chicken which was a pile of soggy spaghetti that does not look/taste appetizing at all. However the service here was really good. I told them I was disappointed with my food and they replaced it right away for me. They even gave us complimentary dessert to make up for it.   Food is average, nothing special but service is definitely 5/5."}
{"text":"I really want to give this a 3.5 out of 5 overall.  Service-wise, this was a 5 out of 5. We were seated immediately and we had kids in a big party. The waitress was very good for taking in the orders as well as each of the different requests/modifications and was very attentive to the table.  Food, I would give this a 3 because they priced their fare fairly high considering the quality. I had a burger and fries, but I've had better burgers elsewhere and the fries were a bit dry. The food came out in a timely manner. But the portions were a bit lacking and could do with a tad bit more volume."}
{"text":"Come for brunch not for dinner.  I went for brunch, had the crab cake benedict, and really enjoyed it.  Went back for dinner with a couple of friends. We ordered the Neptune Pizza, BBQ chicken pizza, and the Margherita Pizza. They were all underwhelming. The Margherita especially (very little mozzarella and basil - basically just sauce and bread). Also the service was worse for dinner, which I didn't understand because there were less people than when I went for brunch."}
{"text":"We ate at Smash Kitchen yesterday. The restaurant is definitely one of my faves to frequent. I ordered the Smash Burger.  I had ordered the salad side, a while back. This time around I went with fries. The chefs at Smash, are generous with the fries portions! The service is excellent! There are plenty of staff walking around. We sat at the high chair table section. Those seats are ideal for hanging long coats. Definitely will be back for more fries and burgers!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today.  It was surprisingly good. Truth be told, I was kind of cranky about it to start, because I live in Leslieville and why oh why do I need to drive to Markham to have pizza?  Anyways, it was pretty good.  My friend made a reservation, and they easily and graciously accommodated, 2 kids, 4 adults and 2 babies, complete with high chairs, etc.  It was chaotic for us when we first arrived, mostly because having all these kids makes things crazy.  The decor was nice.  I didn't have a chance to read too many reviews, and had my heart set on the margherita pizza going in.  Well it turns out that Monday or Monday lunch is $10 pizza special day.  So, yes please.  I ordered the margherita for my baby (who's taking solids and preparing himself for years of cheese-eating pizza fun), with intentions to take home leftovers for hubby, who had to work, so couldn't join us.  He was happy because really, a baby can't eat a whole pizza.   I ordered the neptune pizza for myself, that was delicious.  There were a number of options, but I was looking at the menu over my friend's shoulder and it's the that I could see.  Plus I like smoked salmon so it was a good choice.    Other items ordered were the BBQ chicken pizza and the meat lovers, a brisket sandwich, some tacos...  Everyone was pleased with their choice, except my friend who ordered the brisket because her sandwich was filled with weird chewy stuff.  She sent it back and the manager/owner came in to apologize and she ordered the bbq chicken pizza and he gave her an additional discount on that, on top of removing the sandwich from the bill.    So overall, the service was good, they were attentive.  I like how they quickly addressed complaints and rectified the situation to customer satisfaction.  I definitely think it's worth visiting, and they will do what it takes to make it right and that you leave a happy camper.  Two thumbs up for service."}
{"text":"Had a nice Christmas lunch with my team, Food was great, pizza looked awesome! I had lunch special, pulled pork taco, and it was very good. Will go back"}
{"text":"Always great service here. Came on a Monday night where they had $12 pizza and $1 corkage.  They saw my bottle of white and brought a chiller over right away. It was busy and our food still came quickly and deliciously. The pizzas are really quite good- we shared the chorizo and Poseidon pizza and had a fried chicken as well.   The pizzas were packed and flavourful and the fried chicken was juicy and not too battered. Even the yam fries were fried nicely. It's really a gem in this neighbourhood to find this modern Canadian cuisine done so well."}
{"text":"Hidden restaurant in Markham. Quite nice decor inside. Staff are friendly and attentive. Food was  on the pricy side for portions they provide.   I ordered the Cornish hen. Plating was great.   Smash kitchen is mostly for the younger crowd that like to socialize and hangout with friends. Their menu is broad with many choices depending on what you want to eat."}
{"text":"Never been to this place before! The decor is decent, and the atmosphere is pretty good! The food that I order is excellence!"}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday and i had a party of around 40. They were so accommodating and gave me the full dinner space to put my friends in. They also served me up a really nice fried doughnut yums!!!!  I had their pizza and omgoodness you'd think this place is small and would just have a regular pizza but thin crust and spinach and mozzarella! So delicious! I've also had their paella which I thought was great. Not so traditional but they're not a Spanish restaurant anyway.   The atmosphere is nice and the servers are super polite and friendly. I'd recommend this for any one. A little tip is that it is a little hidden.... So keep trying to find that corner spot!"}
{"text":"Smash Kitchen remains one of my favorite restaurants to grab comfort food. It is generally busy so I highly recommend reservations. But I have also visited on numerous occasions without a reservation but the waiter was able to seat my group relatively quickly. I enjoy the food and service here so I do come quite often as I live in the area.   Some of my favorite items are the ahi tuna wontons, brisket grilled cheese, and LA mac & cheese. I also love coming for brunch. Highly recommend the LA mac and cheese, and you can also choose to add this as a side if you want another entree."}
{"text":"Always busy for brunch. It seems to be the place to hold a party. Their brunch never disappoints and service is always great. A decent sized menu and they have about 4-5 different benedicts to choose from. I love their hefty french toast.  I need to come back on a weeknight for their daily specials!  Check in to get 10% off!"}
{"text":"RATING: 3.5. First time coming here after hearing only good things about this place. They have a saturday/sunday brunch menu that lasts until 3pm. It was pretty packed when I went around 1pm, but we managed to get seated at the bar right when we got in which I didn't mind. I found that the staff were nice and helpful despite it being very busy. I ordered the crab cakes benedict which was 2 crab cakes with poached eggs on top. It came with their \"smash browns\" which I was expecting to be actual hash-browns but basically just home fries. I enjoyed my meal overall, but would definitely try something else if I were to come back for brunch. One of the poached eggs were slightly overcooked, but nonetheless, still tasty. Looking forward to trying something from their dinner menu next time."}
{"text":"The place looks new, very spacious and has a great atmosphere. There are huge windows at the back, bringing a lot of sunlight into the restaurant. Staff was welcoming and helpful.   My boyfriend and I came here for brunch, which is only served on the weekends. There is a brunch combo option available for a drink and a dessert. I ordered the crab cake benedict and it was delish. The crab cakes were crispy on the outside, had a lot of crab meat. The hollandaise sauce was not too heavy, and didn't over power the taste of the crab cakes.   The chicken and waffles is a must-have. The chicken is fried perfectly without being too oily and the meat was juicy and tender. The citrus maple syrup paired well with the chicken and there was definitely a kick to it. I am so glad to find a good brunch option uptown and I will definitely be back for more.  I was surprised at the number of tables that were filled but we came here pretty early. It is located at the corner at the very back of the plaza, so it is very easy to miss. As well, there is a 10% discount, but it can't be used for Friday or Saturday."}
{"text":"We needed an uptown Valentines Day Dinner spot, so we decided upon Smash. Upon on arriving, we were surprised by how big and spacious the restaurant was. Definitely great for large parties. We settled on the The Baja Fish Tacos / The Chicken & Ribs and the Poseidon Pizza.   The tacos came out very quickly, the fish was perfectly battered, and although there was only two tacos, it was huge and filling.   Between the tacos and our main course, we waited more than 20 minutes. Because of the long wait, our server gave us a complimentary Cesar salad. The fried chicken I found to be a bit dry, but thanks to the delicious gravy, it made up for it. The ribs was definitely the shining star in this meal. The ribs was tender and flavourfully soaked in a sweet bbq sauce.   Lastly we had the lobster pizza, it was good but I think because of the wait, we got full from eating the salad. So after a slice each, we packed the rest home.   Overall, the service at Smash was excellent, the manager occasionally came in as well to check up on us and our server was very attentive. Overall, Smash is a great place for a date night or large group party occasion."}
{"text":"Went to SMASH for the first time this weekend for brunch.  Like the modern restaurant design.  It is not what you expected at a restaurant in a small plaza.  Had hard time decided on a dish since I want to try them all but finally picked chicken waffle.  Mainly because i saw the other table ordered it and it looks good.   When the food arrived, mostly they look good but I was disappointed about the small portion of the chicken on my dish compare to other table.  I tried all my friends' food (crab cake benny, classic breakfast, french toast) and they all tasted average.  Overall, the food look better than it tasted.  One good experience I had is the service.  Our waitress is really attentive and on point.    I will give it a second try for the regular menu and see if I will change mt rating for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Inconspicuous and hidden behind an old plaza somewhere in Markham. There us just way too much to rave about that I don't even know where to begin.  The food is just great. You absolutely cannot go wrong with anything you order. Pizza, ribs, seafood, pasta...etc go ahead, don't think, just order it. Drinks? Go ahead, just do it.  They have daily specials that repeat weekly so check it out in the tips section in Yelp."}
{"text":"Came back on Taco Tuesday ($1 off each taco). We really liked the tacos last time and we think the tacos are underrated. The deal is not amazing, we actually wanted to come for the $10 Smash Burger deal but it's actually on Wednesday.  We had: korean chicken taco, lobster taco, fried calamari taco, jerk chicken taco, duck taco, Smash burger  Since this is an update, I will only write points that are different from our last visit.  1. Korean chicken taco was good, Steven really liked the coleslaw in the taco. Very flavourful. 2. Lobster taco same as last time, delicious. 3. Fried calamari taco was also good. The calamari was fried very well, crispy batter on the outside, tender/chewy inside, and had the calamari flavour. I really wanted to just pick out the fried calamari and eat it lol. 4. Jerk chicken taco was a disappointment. Chicken had an odd flavour that was nothing like any of the jerk chicken I've eaten before (it didn't even taste salty), and they had some pineapple in the taco but it definitely did not mesh well with the \"jerk\" chicken. Every bite was a bite of sadness for this one. 5. Duck taco was pretty good but more sour than I remember it to be. Could use more of the sweet Beijing duck sauce. 6. Smash burger same as last time, delicious."}
{"text":"Was looking for a decent burger and I found it !    Came here late on a Tuesday. Very few people in the place, but decided I'd sit at the bar since I was solo.  Place is dimly lit and actually quite intimate.    The server working the bar was very friendly.  I had wanted a stout beer and there was one on tap, but I wasn't impressed.  No matter.   I ordered the burger that I was craving and hung out at the bar.  Since the place was kinda dead, I just watched the Hockey game on the TV while waiting.  My food was served up shortly there after and the burger was definitely a good one.  I had asked for fries with it and those were definitely good... not fab, but good.  The burger was juicy although not entirely flavourful.    Once I was done, I paid my bill and out the door I went.   Overall, the place was very nice decorated, and seeming like it was pretty new.  Place was clean, servers were very friendly and food was good.  It's definitely one of the better burger places I've been to in the area.  However, not the greatest burger I've ever had.  That being said, I liked it and I'll definitely go back to try some of the other meals."}
{"text":"We decided to come here for the 1st time to celebrate my hubby's birthday. It was a Friday evening so it was quite noisy there.   Our menu of the night:  1. Grilled Calamari (Appetizer) The squid was quite tender and tasty. But one of our bread was burnt a little.   2. Seafood Cakes (Appetizer) This is basically a crab cake but it was filled with more than 1 seafood item. Taste was quite good as well.   3. The Monster Burger It was quite a big burger, even had a fried egg in it. But the only bummer was that the bottom of the bun was quite soggy, it broke apart when you lift to eat it. Taste was ok.  4. Grilled Salmon The salmon was nicely cooked and quite tasty. There was also some greens, corn and orzo pasta, and they paired very well with the salmon.   5. Buttermilk Fried Chicken The chicken had a nice crisp and taste was ok. But the biscuit was way too soggy, because it sat between the sauce at the bottom and the chicken on top.   5. Cornish Hen. Taste was ok, didn't get a chance to taste it myself. But that is what my father in law said :P He said he wished he had bread and salad with it.   6. Seafood Paella Presentation was nice. But also didn't taste it myself.  Another bummer was that my husband ordered a Caesar Salad, but it never came to the table. And also the kid's meal didn't mention anything in the menu, that salad and chocolate milk was an extra cost.  Overall, the food was great. We would probably come back to try other stuff."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and twice in the recent 6 months.  The service is nice and attentive and there's always someone checking on you to make sure you're enjoying your meal. The restaurant itself is nice and open, but I would say that they need to consider some acoustic furnishings.. something to absorb sounds, because the shape of the restaurant makes it so I can actually hear people chatting in the next section. It's really quite noisy.  The food here is okay. It's modern and they've tried to put their own twist to regular comfort foods like Pizza and Mac and Cheese. I wish they'd spend more time on finding fresh ingredients for better flavours, especially at their prices. The mac and cheese is a section of the menu that I've tried all of. The pasta is always over cooked, and the truffle one tastes like it was doused with truffle oil all over. It's not really the quality I guess I'm looking for.  It's a fun restaurant to visit, but I just don't think it's worth the pricing. I'd rather go elsewhere for better quality and menu options."}
{"text":"Food very good quality and great flavours. Some portions of food are much more than others. The chicken and ribs can feed 2 regular sized appetites while the salmon can satisfy 1 or less appetites.   It's a nice place to take a date, the waiters are very polite and attentive. They have house cocktails which are nice."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. We have been multiple times and will be back again. We have had dinner there but I would recommend brunch. The portions sizes are good and the staff are very friendly.   I had the monster burger and it was delicious. Difficult to eat but very satisfying.   They also have two private rooms that you can reserve if you are having a more intimate gathering."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the service is always great. Though it's on the pricer side, the dishes are well prepared and taste great. I tried the lobster mac and cheese tonight and it was amazing! On a weekend, I'd recommend getting a reservation because it does tend to get crowded."}
{"text":"I go here all the time. Food is great, decent amount of beers on tap, the staff is wonderful, and the owner is super cool. Kind of place you want to support. It's a hidden little gem in Markham. Check it out if you're looking for a good time and good eats."}
{"text":"Very nice and clean bar. It hard to find bars like these around these areas the location is perfect. The place is a bit hidden and they have some TVs is weird locations. The washrooms are clean the food is amazing. Make sure to the poutine"}
{"text":"Not Amazing. I saw all these good reviews, but obviously things have changed. The food was, ok. I had the garden omlette, my partner the chick and waffles and many in our party had the crab cakes egg benedict.  The chicken and waffles, was not crispy but rather soggy and the sauce was like a spicy plum?  My omlette was satisfactory. The service was lack luster. For a place that demands an 18% gratuity for parties over 8 they sure didn't do their best to earn it. I had to physically leave my table and retrieve sugar from another. Many had to ask several times for our drink orders to be filled.  And what kind of \"upscale brunch\" take the men's orders first!?!?  Driving from Leslieville to Markham for Brunch. . . . A mistake I won't easily make again.  On the plus, parking is free and plentiful. :)"}
{"text":"Busy place and you definitely have to make reservations to make sure you get spots but regardless we were seated quickly even without reservations. I was surprised to learn that on weekends they only serve the brunch menu until 3 PM and we had looked forward to the lunch before getting there. There were only 2 vegetarian options which I wasn't too happy about but despite all that the French toast tasted really good! It was great and definitely worth its price! My friend got the breakfast plate and she loved it too! It is a little expensive but worth it! Need to come back another day to try the lunch/dinner menu though!"}
{"text":"Waiting for table of 5 was 20 mins.  Got the pumpkin beer, it was seasonal drink, it was meh.  Girlfriend got coors light and it tasted flat and metallic.  Server was willing to change a new one.    Ordered the monster burger, tasted kinda sweet. Not my liking.  Girlfriend ordered the surf and turf with jerk pork belly and octopus.  It also tasted weird.  The octopus was tender though.    All in all I would not come next time or crave for it."}
{"text":"I have been to this location since it was Bluestone, and actually stopped going to that restaurant as it was just too inconsistent. So I was interested to see what Smash would be like. First time wasn't good - it was closed for a private party. Second time was much better; I came for lunch and the food was - well, not world class for sure but tasty and well done. Enough that I'd want to go back again, which I did. But the third time ... ah, the third time wasn't a charm.   There were just two of us and after looking over the menu we ordered a pizza, the buttermilk fried chicken and a halloumi salad. All three items turned up at the same time, less than 10 minutes after we ordered, Usually you're asked - would you like the salad first or with the entrees? But no. Boom it all just arrived.   The fried chicken was really salty and one of the two pieces was a dark brown and we couldn't eat it. You don't cook a chicken thigh in less than 10 minutes so I can only assume it had been pre-cooked and just sitting there. That's fine for KFC but not for a restaurant that charges $ 24. The halloumi salad was good with nice tasty chunks of fried and breaded halloumi. I personally prefer my halloumi just pan fried without the breading but this was fine.  The margherita pizza came with a balsamic reduction and whole cherry tomatoes on top, just warmed through. You'd think if they have a pizza oven they'd have that nice slightly charred collapsed cherry tomato thing going on but not in this case. Oh and the pizza crust was burned in spots. I get adding your personal touch to dishes but seriously, don't mess with the margherita. It's just tomato, mozzarella and basil. Leave the balsamic drizzle for something that actually needs it.  Thing is, we turned up quite early for dinner - before 7 I think - and the place was not really that busy. Empty enough that we were seated right away anyway. On the plus side the manager did take the chicken off the bill.  i see several positive reviews and wonder if maybe I am just not destined to have much luck eating at restaurants at this location. I do hope for their sake that the meal we had was an aberration and not the norm, otherwise it won't be there that long."}
{"text":"Great place to have brunch with a crowd. They very easily and happily sat 16 people for a birthday brunch.  Talking about food, placed eggs on crab cakes instead of English muffins, great idea and delicious. The rest of the dishes on the table looked great and everyone liked their meals. The service was great considering there was 16 people to serve.   As an added bonus they allowed us to bring our own birthday cake and were happy to serve it to us."}
{"text":"Heard many things about this spot, so I had to give it a try. I hadn't been here since it was the Bluestone Bistro. I am happy to say this place is a lot better as a Gastropub. The design is great. It has a nice bar, plenty of tables, and there isn't much of a wait. Even though the place was busy, every table was used, it wasn't a restaurant that keeps a line while there are empty tables. Service was excellent. The server was always available to refill glasses, provide suggestions/advice, and to answer any questions.  Upon checkin, I always take the time to find what other Yelpers are recommending, so I went with the Smash Burger which was pretty amazing. There are a ton of recommended options on the menu that sound delicious. I will definitely be back to try the brunch as well.  Overall, I am excited to visit this place again to see what else they have to offer."}
{"text":"Bookmarked it, tried it, LOVED IT !   I came here for a late Saturday lunch with the hubby,  and fell in love with it the minute I walked in. Tucked in a little cozy corner, the inside gives you a warm trendy feel the minute you walk in. We were greeted by the super friendly staff, who seated us in a half moon booth facing the mounted tv's.   I was starved so everything on the menu was jumping at me TRY ME EAT ME!!!  I settled for the grilled calamari appetizer and the surf and turf burger (yah I pigged out.. so what), and my husband ordered the ceasar salad to start with the Monster burger with onion rings.   we got our appetizers shortly after the drinks were served and they were delicious. I was a little disappointed that the calamari was a bit smaller than some of the pictures from other reviews... looked like they skipped on a whole calamari ring.... but mehh nonetheless still tasty.   The burgers were good, he was really enjoying his but mine was alright... I picked at the insides more than the patty... it was a bit dried out but the lobster salad on top of it was good....would I order it again probably not.  I'm definitely coming back to try other items on the menu!!! I've mentally booked mark a few items (the lobster mac and cheese... I'll see you next time)"}
{"text":"Ahi Tuna Wontons - way too much peanut dressing and slaw  Seafood Paella - sauce was tasty but too salty. note it's made with orzo instead of the usual rice.  Angry Lobster Linguine - again, the sauce is good.. but pretty standard dish.   Also shared Neptune Pizza, Tandoori Halibut... underwhelming. Everything was borderline ok but nothing to write home about...   Although it is a casual restaurant, service was unprofessional, the server acted like a joke the whole time and came to check up on us at least 5 times within 5 minutes -- rush to get off work??"}
{"text":"We have been here a couple times for dinner and they were all pleasant experience. This time we came here on a sat for brunch.  We did have to wait a bit but it wasn't too bad. Wait staff were friendly and proactive.   Brunch menu offers mostly Bennys and omelette. Bf ordered a smash burger and I ordered the chicken waffles. It was another wave of wait which was even longer than the waiting of the table.  Bf thoroughly enjoyed his double patty smash burger and rated it a 4/5. I had a bite and I love it too! And lots of fries on the side. If the burger could have been a bit juicer it may score a 5.  Onto my chicken waffles, it was a bit of a letdown especially when it was the most expensive item on the menu..(see the pix) the taste was great however the texture wasn't very good. The skin+batter crust was soooo thick and hard and over-fried. It's two third of the whole piece of chicken! I eventually had to remove the crust part and just ate the chicken. The marinate of the chicken was good though with some spice to it. But overall I didn't enjoy it as much as I would like.  I would come back to try the bennys though."}
{"text":"Came a few times for brunch with family. Amazing place. Quite and fresh food. Large portion. Must try!!"}
{"text":"I work in the same plaza as Smash. Myself and lots of my staff have eaten there. No one has ever been disappointed. Absolutely delicious. Staff are all amazing whether they're serving a table or just getting out of their cars in the parking lot. So friendly. Owner, Jason, is a modest and honest guy with a welcoming smile and is running the restaurant better than ever. If you're looking for a $3 burger, it's not going to be here, but it is definitely one of the BEST burgers I've ever had. Totally worth the price. I get it regularly to-go at lunch time.  Would recommend Smash any day/any time!"}
{"text":"It's been a few months since my last visit and it seems like it's gone down. The service was very very slow and the food wasn't as decent as i remembered. They changed their Margherita pizza. Instead of topping it with several fill basil leaves, they top it with one shredded leaf. The cheese on it is also shredded instead of large flat slices of cheese - very disappointing. One of the waiters said they changed it because they kept running out of basil leafs. There goes consistency! If you can't serve a Margherita pizza correctly, then take it off the menu. Everything from drinks, to food and the bill took awhile to come to us, the waitress just disappeared for long periods of time. We couldn't even see her to flag her down. When she appeared she was pleasant and nice however the long intervals between everything doubled the amount of time we wanted to spend there. Sorry, not going back and can't recommend this place to anyone. Not even for the pizza."}
{"text":"Went with my friend for a special event and we had a pleasant evening (of course good company already calls for a good night ;D). We went on the day of their Monday special of $10 pizzas and I am so glad that we did. But before that, since there was a very good special, I anticipated a lot of people and made reservations just in case. Whoever I talked to was very polite and helpful so I had high hopes for the service even though many people here complained about service in general.  So the question we had was, what was the catch for the $10 pizzas? Nothing! We thought the pizzas would be smaller or only a small selection of the pizzas were $10 but nope, all of the pizzas are $10 and they are the same size as every other night so that was really nice to know. Especially when two of their pizzas had lobster/smoked salmon and shrimp!  So we got their Spinach and Sundried Tomato Dip with slices of Naan bread as our opening. The dip was very flavourful and we really liked it a lot. The naan bread was a little bit less consistent as some pieces were either really chewy or too crisp to the point of burnt. But we were happy with the dip enough to look over that.  We ordered two pizzas because the deal was too good to pass up on. We got their Neptune Pizza which had Smoked Salmon, Shrimp, Arugula, Capers and a Garlic bread spread topped with Balsamic Vinegar on a thin crust. I really liked this pizza as there were huge slices of smoked salmon everywhere and everything else was very flavourful. They did not hold back at all. The other pizza was their BBQ Chicken Pizza topped with BBQ Chicken, Freshly Chopped Corn, Red Onions and Cashews which was really weird but it did work. Never had cashews on a pizza before but it was a nice crunch added. It was very meaty, and our only complaint was that the BBQ sauce was a bit much and made the pizza superly flavourful but other than that it was good. There were a ton of slices, maybe 8 or so and it was more than enough for us to finish that we had to take some home.  To comment on the service, it was nice and we didn't have much problems at all. We each had Keiths' that were bottled but poured in nice glasses for us by our waiter. We were checked up about our food quite frequently and they all had very welcoming attitudes. The only thing I could mention though was that our waitress took a little time to come back to take our order but maybe it was because we were really hungry and was impatiently waiting!   Overall, service was good, food was pretty tasty and we had a good time. The atmosphere was nice and the decor was pretty modern. Although normally a little expensive, it's what I would expect at a Western restaurant/bar type place. As long as the food's good and the service is good then I'm good too :)"}
{"text":"3 with an .5 for service...maybe it was just our server or maybe that's the standard. But she was super attentive and helpful. However she forgot our water but other than that deserved every penny  I ordered an L.A Mac and cheese. It came in a skillet which was pretty cute...although with that price tag I should have got to keep the skillet $14 dollars for such a small portion... I'm a broke uni student so I'm just thinking how many McDoubles can I buy with that. Other than that the Mac & cheese was creamy gooey and artery clogging.  Sweet potato fries were pretty standard. Sorbet was good but could be made at home.   Solid alternative to non-Asian food in Markham that's not a Boston pizza or Kelsey's"}
{"text":"Came here on Friday as a walk in party of 4. I can understand the hype about this place, it's a rarity in the area. The concept is good and the atmosphere is fantastic. However, the food doesn't live up to the hype, in my opinion.  Came in at 7, and were told we could either sit at the bar, or sit in the dining room and leave by 8:30 since there were reservations. We decided to sit in the dining room and then have drinks after elsewhere.   Service here is amazing. Servers are attentive and quick and friendly.  I ordered the fried chicken and it was disappointing. Very greasy, and one piece was really dark and tasted like the oil needed to be changed. The mash was only okay and the corn was meh. My friend had the smash pizza and said that was good. Another ordered the lamb shank and said it was good also. My fiance ordered the chicken and ribs and the dish was exactly the same as mine, except it had ribs. Lacking a little creativy there.   Overall, it was alright. I'm not sure I would come back here.. but if I do, I'll probably stick to a pizza or something."}
{"text":"Still great food!  I'd like to say the half mac and racs are absolutely delicious. Along with that, the venizon, Neptune's pizza, clam chowder and paella as well (Yes, I had a bite of everybody's food). Would definitely recommend ordering those mains, or if you want you can always share a few mains and the server will gladly give you extra plates. Every time I've been here, the service has been fantastic I must say!   My original review mentioned it was great for large gatherings, however I'd like to point out it's great for large gatherings specifically if you book a private room.   My reasoning for this is because the interior of the restaurant is all hard wood. You're probably wondering, why does that matter? Well, something I've learned is that sound waves bounce off hard wood, causing noise to be everywhere making it difficult to hear one another, especially if you're sitting on a rectangular table and want to talk to somebody on the other side. If that's the case, talk to them after."}
{"text":"So I was excited to return to Smash Kitchen because I had the best experience there the first few times that I went. I even considered Smash as one of my all time favourite places to visit. Then I had to ask myself What The Fudge Is going on? We came with a Birthday Party. I kinda felt like our server was no where to be found at times, because we wanted to ask questions and order drinks multiple times but she wasn't around. Also we had a free appetizer saved on our Yelp App, we showed our server and she said there was a new promo of 10% off the bill. She mentioned that she would check with the manager if they would honour the free app that we had saved. She never did get back to us about it until we asked her again. She finally asked about it and told us the manager said no but offered the 10% discount. At the end of the night she did not do separate bills for us, and she \"forgot\" the 10% discount. Worst of all she made things so complicated at the end. There was someone who used their 10% discount on their phone for the bill, but for some reason she required 2 phones to apply the 10% to the bill. I understand we were two tables but we were one party. We had the free appetizer promo on our phone and not the 10% discount but she insisted that someone else show her the 10% discount coupon. I may give this place another chance in the future just because of my first experience, but it may take a while. Cooling off period. Jimstar Out!!"}
{"text":"I've been to Smash a couple of times in the past few weeks for lunch and brunch. The food and service were good enough to put them on the short list when some old friends from high school wanted to get together for dinner. Tonight's experience warrants another review and elevation to five star status!  There were eleven of us, with almost everybody coming here for the first time. We were seated in a smaller, more intimate area that was quite cozy. A couple of friends, not related to our group, were seated in the same area a few minutes later. Oooh, was it their date night?  After a few drinks and getting reacquainted, we ordered our meals. Despite our last three guests arriving late, after we had started ordering, all the food came out at the same time, with the latecomers actually getting served first. The food came out of the kitchen a lot quicker than we anticipated. They were also able to tweak a couple of the dishes to satisfy some dietary preferences. Good job from the kitchen!  Our meals included MacnCheese, Paella, Pizza, Club Sandwich, Cobb Salad, Chicken and Ribs, Steak, and Cornish Hen. The presentation on all the dishes was really attractive (see photos). The taste was even better!  The Club Sandwich was served like a wrap, on naan. It certainly looked a lot better than the one I had for lunch earlier in the day and K said it was absolutely delicious. M was raving about his Chorizo Pizza right until the last crumb. L and T enjoyed the Paella and would probably have eaten the shells if they could. W performed a magic act by making his Steak disappear before setting his sights on P's Chicken and Ribs. My Piri Piri Cornish Hen was so good, I would have licked the plate! Everybody truly enjoyed their meals.  Although we were all stuffed, we just had to try their desserts. We had the Chocolate Bar (brownie, mousse, raspberry), Mango Sorbet, White Chocolate Raspberry Creme Brulee, and coffee. Sounds delicious? It was! Civility prevented us from licking the plates.  Our server, Nick, did an outstanding job! He was courteous, professional, efficient, and very patient. Our last guests arrived almost an hour late and we were the last ones to leave. Sorry, Nick.  Our group included couples that were high school sweethearts who have known each other for 40+ years. That's unusual these days. It was a great evening of friendship and good food. Smash provided the perfect setting. Bravo!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times, mostly for brunch on the weekends. The entrance is hidden in the far corner of the plaza, just look for the big round yellow sign. The space itself is well decorated and spacious, there is even a patio space in the back that is open on nice days.   The brunch menu here has plenty of choice but is not particularly innovative, they have the usual classic breakfasts to heavier plates like the meatloaf skillet. My friend swears by their french toast but I always prefer something savory for brunch and went with the bacon mushroom omelette instead. The omelette is generously stuffed with cheese and mushrooms and came with a 4 half-slices of bread, a pile of salty sm'hash browns, and a small skewer of fruit. I would have preferred to switch out either the bread or potatoes for a salad or something lighter because it was just alot of carbs on one plate. A good place for a traditional brunch in a nicely decorated space."}
{"text":"Arrived @5:30pm on Friday night and were seated immediately. Not much from outside but once you get in, it's very nicely decorated darkened room. Incredible customer service to the point where my son commented on how very very nice our waiter was.  My kids, 10 and 13 insisted I leave a great review on Yelp.  Ordered:  - Smash Burger, my son gave this the thumbs up.  He's a burger expert and this one is top 3.  We asked for well done for him.  Usually, they cook it to medium well. - Chicken Bites, I think this is chicken ?thigh?  It felt a little too tender to be breast but it was very good.  I liked the Korean ketchup, my husband didn't.  I'll also eat almost anything with Panko. - Beef Cheek Poutine, the beef is so very tender and delicious.  Fries and gravy are also best friends so this combination is always a winner.  A little salty but it could just be our palates because we cook with very little salt. - Seafood Salad, nice seared tuna, shrimp, crab cake.  Nothing was dry or overcooked.  Sweet Treats: We didn't order dessert but our waiter brought mini donuts in caramel sauce that did not survive more than 3 minutes with our kids.  I see they have a brunch menu.  I'm intrigued."}
{"text":"Got the fried chicken and ribs + sweet potato fries: Fried chicken - soft, not dry, goes well with the gravy! Ribs - tender meat off the bone, only downside is the low meat to bone ratio (too much bone), the sauce is on the sweeter side of BBQ sauces, so it's good if you have a sweet tooth like me Sweet potato fries - hard to go wrong with this, downed the whole thing in a flash  Baked maple-glazed salmon:  The outside sugar coating sealed the deal for this one. Each bite came with a crisp of maple sweetness and juicy salmon"}
{"text":"Their staff is always super friendly and helpful. I hate when most wait staff don't know whats on the menu but they're really knowledgable. I've been here a couple times and their seafood cakes are delicious. Their paella isn't traditional as they use orzo instead of rice. I've tried a bunch of the pasta dishes with friends and family and they're all delicious.   Definitely one of my new favourite places in markham"}
{"text":"Don't let the small sign outside fool you. Classy interior, big restaurant and great service from entrance to exit. The 3 egg garden omlette was filling and just right on flavour with perfect combination of cheese and veggies. Great coffee to accompany the big meal."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday with some friends. Nice, cozy environment. However, service was a bit disappointing. Waited for 15 mins before being seated, the waiter we had was either too busy serving other tables or was avoiding us.    We ordered the lobster mac & cheese, a pizza, bacon wrapped meatloaf and an apple smash 2.0.  The savoury dishes were alright. The mac & cheese was the only hit for our table, it was filled with cheese but the portion was a bit too small. The pizza had a thin crust with sausages and pepperoni on top, again nothing special about it. (I actually didn't like it cause it is too thin.)  The meatloaf was ok, but again nothing too special.  Apple smash 2.0 had a nice presentation, but was a bit too sweet for us.  Overall, it was a nice place. I'd like to come back and try their breakfast/brunch menu."}
{"text":"It's a nice place to have lunch/brunch in Markham.  Cool ambience, comfortable seating and good service. The lobster Mac and cheese was very rich and tasty, the Neptune pizza was good to share and delicious as well.  We also tried the burger the waitress recommended and thought it was juicy but nothing really special, just a good fresh heart burger. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Definitely wouldn't waste my time to go back this place. Food just sucks and not worth my while. Worst than mediocre cuisine, just got to a fast food joint. You'll pallet will thank you. It's really just the food that turns me off, other than that, ambiance and staff is ok. But, don't you go to an eatery to eat??? LOL"}
{"text":"We ordered salad as the entree. The portion is huge!  The price is reasonable, but it can be add up quickly when you add the side order.  The warm steak salad is good, only the steak is a little bit overcooked to my expectation.   I would recommend this kitchen and bar to anyone close by this area.  Remember to make reservation ahead, so you don't have to wait to get seated."}
{"text":"This restaurant is right on highway 7, good location with a lot of parking spots. I had their pasta, salad, taco, and pizza. Their pizza is one of my favs. It's a huge whole pizza !!! Yummy !! Their crust is a flat bread which makes it really soft and crunch. Another fav is their fish taco. Check them out :)"}
{"text":"Love their food here. I come to this place exclusively for their brunch menu.. which is on Saturday and Sunday from 9-3pm. My favourites are the crab cakes Benedict and the smash chicken and waffle. Absolutely delicious! The portions are also on the larger side and for a notional prix fixe price of $20 you get a brunch item, coffee/tea and dessert :) I can never finish the brunch and dessert so I always have stuff to take home :) Definitely a favourite neighborhood gem in the Markham unionville neighborhood! They also have a small patio outside and they have a few private rooms for small functions or private gathering as well!   Def recommend trying this place and they have specials throughout the week too! Their pizza is amazing :)"}
{"text":"I returned two weeks ago for lunch with coworkers. This 5-star rating is given due to consistency over the many meals I have had here.  The food quality is consistently delicious.  The service has been consistently polite, efficient, and professional.  I have had no problem splitting the bill every time."}
{"text":"I have been here on several occassions. Great casual place for brunch, big group (they have private dining), or a small gathering. They have great specials like $1 corkage fee and $10 pizzas on Mondays. Friendly staff and food usually comes out pretty quickly. My recommendations are tacos and beef cheek poutine for appetizers. For mains, there are a lot of good choices like salad, burgers, pizza, mac and cheese, and ribs. Also, they have a great brunch menu. I suggest making reservations as they can get quite busy on some nights."}
{"text":"I've been back here several times... not yet with a date *sigh*.  Each time has been excellent, so I am upping my rating to 5 stars.  My favorites would be the BBQ brisket grilled cheese and the topless steak sandwich.  Both were awesome and I have recommended them to friends who have thanked and heartily agreed with me.  Last time out I tried the Smash burger and a Smash Blonde.  Thoroughly enjoyed both.  I don't consider Smash Kitchen to be a burger place, but it will get added to my burger list because it is just that good.  Haven't been? Go.  Also, check in and get a free app deal (with the purchase of 2 entree's) if that is still on."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their crab cake egg Benedict last time I was here. But today, just wanted to try something light, so I got a cobb salad, which was just ok.. As in edible.. The chicken beast was so over cooked, even its cut in small pieces, it's obvious some pieces are burned, half of it is really dry, I'd say only 35% is good to enjoy.. I wonder if McDonald's chicken salad provides better tasted soft grilled chicken breast. Regardless.. We sorta came here for its layout, atmosphere, experience so to speak. So overall it's satisfying brunch, and I'd come here again, but not the Cobb salad."}
{"text":"We ordered eggs benedict and the smash burger. The hollandaise was super rich. The burger was delicious and tender. Sweet potato fries were crispy. Would definitely return and order the exact same dishes."}
{"text":"When it comes to customer service, this place not only delivers but it amazes.  I had a reservation for dinner with friends but had to wait 20 minutes since the place was packed. When I got my table, the manager felt bad and served us a free pizza and gave us a free appetizer of our choice. At the end of our meal, we also got a gift card for $25. The service here is just that good that I feel bad for not sharing my experience.   Now with bias aside, the food was alright. I ordered the chicken and ribs and it was quite tasty. The chicken is much better than the ribs since the ribs were somewhat dry. The dish could also use more vegetables since all you really get is corn and mashed potatoes.   Overall, the exceptional service and great environment would make me come again. I am also a sucker for cute waitresses which is always a plus."}
{"text":"I spied this place on the Savour York Region Menu listing of Restaurants, realized it was fairly close to where I live, and decided to check it out with my boyfriend the other night.  In the little plaza it's in, it is kind of hidden away in the back, you might miss it if you're not actively looking for it :-).  The decor is really nice, clean & modern. It's a good place to go if you're bringing a large group of people as they have several areas that could seat 8+. They also have a few little booths if you're with a smaller group.  Our server was extremely friendly, though with that being said, we were not checked on too often through-out our meal and the service was fairly slow (the restaurant was also not too busy at this time.)  We had the mac & cheese with bacon for an app, which was decent, but a bit bland, and definitely lacking in the bacon department. The cheese sauce was pretty mild (it made me think of something I'd want to slather all over some cauliflower, though :)).  I had the BBQ Fire Grilled Chicken, and my boyfriend had the Chicken Penne. The presentation of the meals is well done, though we both agreed that like the mac & cheese, they were both good, but still a bit bland. The grilled corn that came with my chicken was deeelish, though!  Then came dessert. Wow. This is the type of place that while the food was good, I did not think I would be coming back, unless a friend wanted to, because I have had better for the same price. But that Banana Toffee Chocolate Cake was like HEAVEN in cake form. It was soft, gooey, and the perfect balance of being not too sweet but just sweet enough. Seriously, it's just amazing - try it if you stumble by this place :).  Overall the experience was decent, and while I don't think I will be coming back for dinner anytime soon, I will definitely be checking out the Brunch if just for an excuse to munch on some more of that heavenly banana toffee chocolate cake :-)"}
{"text":"Been here couple times previously as the restaurant in close to where I live.  Came here again for my birthday with two other friends on a Sunday night.   My friends and I decide to share a appetizer and two entrées as we were not extremely hungry at the time.  We ordered the burnt ends(recommended by the server), Smash lovers pizza and the Seafood paella. the burnt ends is smoked brisket, assorted pickles and bib lettuce that you make a wrap with.  It was only OK for me as the brisket was a bit on the drier side for me. The pizza and the seafood paella were really good. The seafood paella was loaded with generous amount of mussels, clams and giant shrimps (my fav)!   Service was a bit rushed. Perhaps its Sunday night, our server had to get off at 9pm.  She kept asking if we're done with our entrees and ready for desserts (at least 3 times).  This was actually pretty bothersome as we were still working on our food. At 9pm, another server served us as our server had to leave (this explains why she was rushing us).  I would come back again on a better day of the week. Of course any day but Sundays."}
{"text":"I've been to Smash Kitchen three times now. The second time I had the lobster mac and cheese which is delicious and has a decent amount of lobster, but also one of the most expensive things on the menu (that isn't something like steak) at $22 dollars, $27 after tax and tip. I'm a small eater and I was full but not stuffed.  The third time we tried the Neptune pizza ($17). The crust is really, really thin so be aware of that. More of a light meal than what you would expect from a regular pizza. This one had shrimp, smoked salmon, red onion, arugula, and a sweet vinaigrette. It was good, but nothing mindblowing and I wouldn't pay $17 for it again. It also won't make you very full. Crust is really hard and thin and breaks apart when you bite into it and slightly burnt.  Looks like Smash Kitchen can be hit or miss depending on what you get but overall pricey for the portion."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the top restaurants in uptown! Extraordinary food, great Service, made us want to go back and try every item on their menu!"}
{"text":"I think this restaurant is trying to be a gastro pub, and their menu descriptions certainly speak of it (lot of Mac n chhese, buttermilk fried chicken, ribs, etc), but the proof is in the eating and unfortunately, this place falls well short.    Had the beef cheek poutine to start.  It was OK, but the gravy tasted like it came from a mix...the dish tasted like fries with Campbell's beef stew poured over it.  Had the Smash burger which was a chef's recommended item.  5 out of 10.  I have had better burgers at Kelseys or other chains.  Ceasar salad side was OK.  Nothing special.  The rib and truffle Mac cheese.  Ribs were actually very good.  Tender and moist.  8 out of 10.  The truffle Mac was 6 out of 10.  Friends had the Cobb salad and the chorizo pizza.  They tasted OK, but again nothing special.  The service is attentive (maybe even overly so...had to tell the servers multiple times that we weren't finished with the app).  This was my second time here.  The first time was for brunch and it was also kinda disappointing.  I wanted to wait for a second visit before I reviewed.  Overall, this place isn't terrible,  can't say I would recommend."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and tried the baby back ribs for $28. I thought the sauce was too strong and overpowered the flavour of the meat. These are not your typical baby back ribs. They are more the size of beef ribs. The meat was tender but not fall off the bone tender. Comes with corn and mashpotatoes.   Also got the angry lobster linguini $23. It came with a lot of lobster but the pasta portion was small.   Service is always excellent.  Although I give it a 3 star this time around there is a reason I have come back here so many times. Service is great and most items I have tried are amazing. Just don't think I will be ordering the ribs any longer."}
{"text":"Visited Smash for Brunch with my husband at about 1130am on a recent Sunday.  He ordered a mushroom omelette and I had the chicken and waffles.  The space looks nice inside...there were a lot  of staff seemingly hanging around...perhaps they get busy later?  It was HOT out, but we chose to eat outside on the \"patio\" as the interior had a smell of a musty, moldy basement. It's a shame as its a nice space inside.  There is a very small, narrow deck in the back setup for outdoor eating.  The table water has an odor.  It actually smells fishy. We ordered tea, juices, but couldn't help but notice the foul water.  Food came quickly...my order ( chicken and waffles) was delish.  There is a orange-y sauce drizzled atop which I would next time request on the side...but all in all, loved every bite.  My husband remarked his omelette was 'ok' and after tasting mine, said it was super good.    Really nice staff; very friendly.  Would return but only on a nice day for outdoor seating unless I knew the indoor situation was fixed.  I hope it is as it seems a great neighbourhood restaurant with a nice menu.  Ps loved the booth they had at one of the festivals on Main St. Unionville."}
{"text":"Great Brunch menu! Nice comfortable interior. Will definitely come back to try dinner out!"}
{"text":"My wife and I took my son and future daughter-in law for an Engagement  celebration dinner.  We had gone to this location when it was under different owners, but this place was worth 5 stars plus.  The restaurant interior is modern, the wait staff super friendly, and most important, the food was \"off the hook\".  We each ordered a different entree and we all were very impressed with our choice.  We had an appetizer and dessert, and we were all more than satisfied.  The presentation of the meals was outstanding, and the flavour fabulous.  The only problem is location.  It is in a plaza, tucked away in the corner, so unless you have heard about it, you would drive right by it.  Word of mouth is very important to promote business here.  They deserve to be noticed.  It would be a shame if this restaurant didn't succeed due to lack of business.  It is hard to find quality at reasonable prices in this day and age.  I really hope that whoever reads this, gets in their car, turn on your GPS and drive over for an eating experience.  You won't be sorry.  Actually, you will be sorry...sorry that you finished your meal and it is time to leave.  Put this on your \"must go\" dining list."}
{"text":"4 stars for food and 5 stars for service. We came on a Tuesday night for our anniversary dinner and my hubby had the all you can eat ribs, I got the Poseidon pizza.  The food came out quickly. The ribs were good, when my husband got his second helping, it was much better fall off the bone ribs, the first rack and the third helping he needed to pull the meat off the bones. So a little bit of inconsistency there. The pizza was amazing! It was so nicely thin and crispy filled with lobster, shrimp, arugula and a creamy tomato base. It was sooo good, even better than Pizza Libretto considering it is not even a pizza joint! I would really recommend getting this pizza, it was worth $19!  Also love the fact they use compostable take out containers that biodegrades and not the styrofoam that is not recyclable in York region.  We enjoyed the atmosphere, the restaurant was beautiful and the service was phenomenal. The waiter kept coming back to see if anything was needed, filling our water constantly. I noticed either the owner or general manager was very observant. He makes sure everything is perfect, even checked the cutlery and noticed a knife was dirty and exchanged it. A couple near us ordered the ribs and salad and calamari. The food all came out together and they explained that they wanted to have the salad to start and she was going to have the calamari as a main. Since both were starters and maybe she didn't specify to the waiter, they did not want the salad in the end.  The waitress took it back and immediately the manager came out and apologized and offered dessert on the house. Even though it may not have been the waiter's fault, they took on the responsibility and made it right.  Customers come back because of this and that is why I say their service was phenomenal.  We were so impressed we tipped them very well.  Definitely will come back and kudos to all the waiters/waitresses and manager/owner!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here last week for date night. It was our first time and we both would definitely gobback. I had the truffle Mac and cheese and boy was it delicious! Probably my most favourite mac and cheese dish. Our waiter was kind and kept checking up on us."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch, but little did we know they do not serve a LUNCH menu at around 1 o'clock. Instead they only serve a BRUNCH menu.   The brunch menu only entails a selection of only breakfast and 1-2 lunch items. Relatively speaking, the prices were a bit expensive for brunch. I had asked the server if we could get another menu besides choosing what to eat off the Brunch menu and the waitress had declined us that they are only serving brunch at the time  and we would have to wait until 2 o'clock for the dinner menu.....   That's the part I don't really understand or agree upon. If nothing on the brunch menu seems fascinating or appeals your interest why would I want to order anything off that menu? And it's the fact that she didn't even give us the choice or option to look at another menu to decide what we want. It's Brunch time, so you only get to choose what you want to eat off the brunch menu?!..... Hey, if I don't want to eat anything off that menu I would be happily to spend more money on a dinner item off the DINNER menu instead and be satisfied.........  So my friend and I had just ordered off the brunch menu, since we both were already hungry and didn't want to waste anymore time... I got the chocolate chip waffles with ice cream. It was alright.. Not really a breakfast or lunch item to be honest. . It's more like a dessert than anything.....  Service was average, food was alright. But wasn't too fond of the limitations about what I can choose to eat and what not."}
{"text":"So many reasons to love Smash  Family loves it here. Delicious creative appetizers like the beef cheek poutine. Friendly attentive service by enthusiastic staff. Boss Jason is an example of commitment and tireless energy. Mondays I love to bring a bottle of wine for next-to-nothing corkage fee. Pizzas are wood oven baked and delicious. New back patio is awesome. Bar has screens and there are also screens in the wall for sports fans, but it is an upscale bistro. The staff love food and wine, and it shows in the finished product. - last visited October 2016"}
{"text":"Smash is a great place for brunch! I've gone a couple times and haven't been disappointed. A little on the pricy side when it comes to add-ons for your meal, but other than that this place is great! I'd recommend it for sure!"}
{"text":"If you don't know this place is here then you might just miss it since it's in a corner of a quiet plaza. I've been here for dinner and brunch and both were excellent. I've ordered the grilled salmon salad and at $17 it was probably the most filling and yummy salad that I've eaten at a restaurant. Although, I don't really eat salad in restaurants so take that with a grain of salt. There was lots of goat cheese pecans and mushrooms. The dressing was great. The salmon wasn't a dinky little piece that could blow away with a strong gust of wind. I actually had a difficult time finishing the whole thing. I also tried the Korean fried cauliflower which was DELICIOUS.   Another time I went to have brunch, I got the eggs florentine and the eggs were perfectly runny. Again, big portions and I couldn't finish all the potatoes. Highly recommend although it does get really busy during brunch so be prepared to wait in line!"}
{"text":"Literally a hidden gem! I was looking for a place in the area to have dinner and came across this place with stellar reviews. The place is literally hidden away at first glance since it's tucked in a corner of the plaza, however you can't miss it with its huge sign above. There's plenty of parking so you shouldn't have any trouble.   Upon arrival, we were greeted with a bunch of smiles and were seated right away. Walking towards our table, the place was super busy. They had a couple tv's with different games playing (too bad raptors wasn't one of them).   To start, we ordered a glass of Pink Rosè Sangria and the Smash Caesar. I'm a huge fan of Sangria's and their Pink Rosè was perfection. Unfortunately I can't comment on the Caesar because I personally don't like them sorry folks! Then we ordered the L.A Mac & Cheese and the Fried Chicken & Ribs with Sweet Potato Fries. Where do I even start?! The L.A Mac & Cheese was simply amazing. On the menu it mentioned that with the L.A Mac & Cheese you can choose a size: Side, Small, or Large. Good thing I ordered a small because it was filling and imo a large would be too over whelming. The ribs were to die for. I mean it just slides right off the bone and the sauce was sweet an savoury - it was just right. The fried chicken came with a gravy sauce which was the perfect combination. However the gravy is not your standard gravy sauce, but it complimented the chicken well. Oh and how can I forget, the sweet potato fries and the spicy mayo was great. My bf said it was the best fries he's had but I think that was his hunger speaking because to me it tasted the same. Overall, I give it a 5/5.  The service was excellent. I could have sworn from the time it took for our server to take our order until we received our drinks and food it was about 10 minutes or even less. All I remember was being surprised at how fast it came! Our server was on top of everything. Overall, definitely a 5/5.   Halfway into our dinner we told ourselves that we definitely have to come back here for more dates and with a group. Might as well become regulars because this place is bomb. I would definitely recommend this place. If you made it this far into this lengthy review, cheers to you!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, including my wedding party rehearsal dinner and each time, I've loved it. It's so great to have a restaurant serving delicious food with friendly service and fun vibes right here in Markham! I love their appetizers, their mac and cheese, their chicken with mashed potato dish. Everything is delicious!   The place itself is hard to find, almost hidden in a plaza but once you step inside, the restaurant is spacious, nicely decorated, perfect for family and friends outings and they're good with crowds. Plenty of free parking in the plaza too. Seriously, a keeper."}
{"text":"I have been to Smash a few times for dinner and it does the trick to satisfy any cravings for Canadian/American food.  Staff: They are always great and friendly. My most recent visit we found ourselves seated at the bar and it was quite amazing at watching him multitask. The food came very quick for us, in fact I thought they made a mistake when they brought it out so fast! I don't think it took any more than 6 minutes for it to come and the place was packed (hence why we were at the bar).  Ambience: It was a nicely lit and had an intimate feel. The game was playing on screens all over. It definitely had a casual pub-like vibe going, but also felt very classy as well.  Food: I had the Surf and Turf Burger with Sweet Potato Fries. To put it bluntly, it was huge. It was two patties, with an additional seafood cake, a few slices of tomato, lettuce, aioli and cheese. There's a reason why they serve it with a knife! It was so good, I loved the seafood cake, it was basically a crab cake but it probably wasn't 100% crab, so kudos to them for the honesty. The Sweet Potato Fries lacked seasoning for me though. In the end, I hadn't been that full from just an entrée in so long.  A nice restaurant in a sea of Asian cuisine in the area. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Upgrading this to a five after tonight's performance. On Mothers Day, full House, they were killing it. Excellent service and hot/delicious/fast food. They were well staffed and working together beautifully as a team. You were great with my kid's allergy. We all enjoyed our meals and how thoughtful to give us some free warm donuts to finish off the meal.   ________________ Lovely brunch this morning with a friend. This is a large but cozy restaurant based on placement of booths and part walls. Service was friendly and very good.  My friend and I opted for the $25 price fixe. It made sense when we were both having coffee/tea. Apparently we ordered the two most popular items on the menu.  Chicken and waffles were delicious and plentiful. I took leftovers home. I was a bit surprised by the chili powder in the fried chicken and easily two tbsp of butter scooped on the waffle. I also would have liked more maple syrup to balance out the chili powder. My friend really enjoyed her crab cake eggs benny and commented the s'mashed potatoes were really fresh. We both had the mixed fresh berries for dessert which was just righ  Washrooms were icy cold unlike the rest of the restaurant. It was below -20C outside though so not a normal day.  All in all a nice and repeatable experience."}
{"text":"Make a reservation!  I was very pleased to have found Smash Kitchen. The food is fresh, tasty and simple. I have a lot of allergies so perservatives aren't my friend! The kitchen is top quality with fantastic combinations. Having lived in Montreal for over a decade ..I got spoiled!!"}
{"text":"Really great spot hidden in the corner of a strip mall! We were feeling something lighter for dinner and wanted to share some appetizers. I went (as usual) based off the Yelp reviews. I would definitely return!   Appetizers we got: Firecracker shrimp - super tasty, how can you go wrong with bacon wrapped shrimp?   Seafood cakes - very meaty! Good seafood flavor.   Tempura broccoli - tasty as well with an Asian flare  Calamari - my colleague enjoyed it! Citrus white wine sauce - quite large for an appetizer.   Lobster Taco - this is my only complaint, the lobster is tempura and with the other flavors, it honestly could have been any fish. I wish they would have highlighted the lobster more in a butter sauce perhaps and not fried. I wouldn't get that again.   Donuts for dessert were great. Fried dough balls dipped in cinnamon and sugar and caramel - winning!   Great spot - don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Was there this past Saturday night with friends. I had the seafood paella. Asked the waiter about it, and he said that it was an amazing dish. I ordered it, and was just happy that I did not get very sick. The dish was very small for the $21 price tag and the seafood was disgusting. There was also supposed to be sausage in the dish...I counted 2 tiny little pieces. My wife had the chicken wrap and there was a lot more protein in that than what I had...she said it was \"ok\". Will not be back."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed brunch and dinner at Smash a few times. My favourite brunch item is the Chicken and Waffles. It comes with a bit of an orange sauce but the friend chicken is extremely tasty. I think it beats a lot of actual friend chicken joints. The atmosphere is similar to that of a milestones or pickle barrel. Service from what I recall was fine. Would visit again!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch.  It's spacious and the food not only looks good but it is very tasty. The only thing was that I felt the there weren't enough assistance due to the size of the restaurant.  It was good that we weren't in a hurry."}
{"text":"This place is hidden in the corner of the plaza, you won't miss it if you look for the sign. Another nice place for brunch. The blueberry mojito was refreshing (was too tipsy to take another pic) but attached was the classic mojito. The smash burger was filling, doesn't look like it's a big portion but trust me this will fill you up, I was rubbing my tummy when I finished my meal. Instead of regular fries, we switch to sweet potato fries. The smash Benedict was so so, could've done it better. The dessert was a bit too sweet for me, we ordered a strawberry short cake if you wonder. We dine in here for dinner a few times, and it was pretty good too. The chicken waffle is the signature dish I believe heArd was not bad. The overall service was friendly and smiley. This place have a small patio open during the summer time as well."}
{"text":"Found this little gem tucked away in the corner of an older plaza and have been meaning to get around to try them out.  Finally I was given a chance today when hanging out with one of my besties and my little sister. Unfortunately, I had just removed my wisdom teeth earlier in the week, but the waitress was so accommodating, and even helped me out if I can handle the Roasted Tomato and Corn Soup by getting me a sample.  Our table started with LA Mac & Cheese, and continued with the BBQ Brisket Grilled Cheese with a side order of fries and the Chicken Mushroom Gnocchi. Everything was great, delicious, and very filling. The only complain was it was too filling, so come with big appetites; you'll be greeted with generous portions for a great price. There are deals throughout the week too!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in quiet plaza in Markham but tge food is so good...brunch is quite nice....decor is cozy and modern....definitely have to try this place!"}
{"text":"First off the restaraunt has a really nice ambiance. We came here right after adamson bbq. We had the fried chciekn  sandwich. It was spicy which I like and massive portion. The chicken was really tender plus the restaurnat was packed which told me the fod has to be good. They have a wide variety of food options l  Next time I have to come here on a empty stomach."}
{"text":"They make a hella good bloody Caesar. We were gifted firecracker shrimp from the server (much appreciated) I have tried nothing else.    The Caesar alone is good enough for 4 stars.  4/5 Caesars all day everyday"}
{"text":"The hub and I came here for the Yelp GTA Elite event, and we had a great time. The food was very good and the place looks awesome. I have seen this location go through different names, and one of the things it was known for was brunch, so we came back with a couple of friends. The food again was good, they had an interesting take on French toast, and my eggs Florentine with smoked salmon were tasty. Our only complaint was the service. Both our server and the owner were incredibly pleasant and helpful but everything was so slow, and there were only 3 other tables of customers at the time. There seemed to be something going on because the staff looked worried. I asked for a cappuccino and I got an americano, and the owner had to come and make it. Also, they mixed up one of our dishes. Pretty strange for a slow day. We might let them figure things out a little more before we return. BTW the s'mores dessert is not what you think, ask before you order."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch twice, the food was mediocre but service was great. From reading other people's review it seems like the good food is in the regular menu, so I have to come back and try this place again! Hope they will up their brunch menu!  I have had the Crab Cakes Benedict and the Belgian Waffles. Thought the crab cake was nothing spectacular but incorporating the crab cakes into the eggs benedict is interesting. The Belgian Waffles came with fresh berries, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. The waffle is average, the berries very fresh.  Overall my brunch was average but not disappointing. I will need to come back and try the regular menu!"}
{"text":"Really nice and warm staff welcomed my bf and me when we arrived on a Saturday night.  We had a reservation so no fuzz at getting seated, nice ambiance and service from the waiter and waitress. Although it has the sports bar feel to it, it has an elegant touch to it without being too loud like Joey's. I had the grilled salmon salad and my bf had this burger with sweet potato . Really liked the salad, the burger is good too but cant say its superb, a bit dry on the meat patties. Bf insisted to try the banana tofee cake he read on yelp that ppl loved; we tried it, its just OK for our taste. Dont get me wrong, it still tastes good, jist dont have the wow factor in it.  So overall the food I give it 3.5, with the ambiance and good service a four star would be proper ;)."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd brunch visit and i'll have to say the food is okay...with some imperfections, service was not mind-blowing.   I'm big on customer service. Although our server was friendly and professional when he took our order, he did not check  on us even once. He did leave us with a bottle of water and a full jug of coffee, so maybe he planned to not have to come back?  We ordered a red sangria, meatloaf skillet and the crabcake benedict.  I'm a sangria fan and I thought their mix was disappointing. It was diluted, with a prominent taste of syrup- you could taste the wine if you closed your eyes and focused for it.   The meatloaf skillet came with 2 slices of meatloaf. The entire playe was pretty warm except for the top piece which was cold in comparison. The crabcakes were a tad bit oily but very tasty. With all these booming new restaurants we probably will not come back for a long while."}
{"text":"Been here many times since it is in my hood  and is a cozy little wine bistro.  Love their beer collection.  Wine selection is a little small though.  Lobstee and cheese was great, and  said paella was  good.  Save room for their creme brullee."}
{"text":"Excellent food at a fair price.  One of my favourite place to dine.  We were there for Monday's Night $10 stone oven pizza special, yum yum at a cheap price.  What more can I ask for."}
{"text":"The service was great, staff were really pleasant. Overall the food was good too. My margarita pizza was a little soggy because they use tomato slices so you have to eat it with a knife and fork. The calamari was great, really well done, sauce it came with was great. When we first got to the restaurant the table we were sat at smelt like it had been wiped down with a dirty cloth. It also took the server 15 minutes to give us change from the bill. Overall I'd give it 3.5/5"}
{"text":"This was my second time eating at Smash Kitchen & Bar and I was excited to have their Ribs & Mac dish again. Unfortunately, it did not live up to the standards of the first experience I had here. I then spoke to my friend about it and he said that there were some staff changes that may have contributed to the changes. Included are the before and after pictures. You'll notice that the Mac used to have these crunchy bits on top which were nonexistent the second time I visited. Oh, and the bed of delicious corn? must have left with the change in management. Also, the ribs were not fall off the bone delicious the second time either. I'll give this place one more shot if they return to the standards of the first visit."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday for lunch with my parents.  We started off with the firecracker shrimp ($14). The shrimps were quite big and they were nicely fried. I thought that the sauce was the right amount of spiciness and sweetness. I did wish they included more garnish because I thought the fresh vegetables went well with the crispiness of the won ton wrapper.  I convinced my dad to get the buttermilk fried chicken ($19). My dad thought that the chicken was fried to the point where it's almost burnt and I have to agree with him. Otherwise, I quite like his entree because the chicken was quite moist.  My mom got the special which was a pulled pork sandwich ($15). When it first came out, I thought the presentation was gorgeous. The pulled pork had a lot of flavour and the fries were perfectly crispy.  I got the surf and turf burger ($19). I feel like I made a bad choice because I didn't really enjoy my burger. There was some lobster in the burger but don't expect whole pieces. The patty was not dry and the onion ring was delicious (I ate it on its own instead of with the burger). I wouldn't recommend getting this burger because there's nothing special about it. It did come with a chicken, carrot and potato soup. It's quite a hearty soup.  Of course, I cannot complete a meal without ordering desserts. We got a lavender creme brulee and carrot cake to share between the 3 of us. I could actually taste the lavender in the creme brulee and it was my favourite out of the two. The carrot cake was just too dry. My mom said it tasted like a McDonald's muffin that they just cut into squares.  I would definitely come back to this restaurant to try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"I had the margarita pizza here and it was crisp, light, and simply delicious. I have worked at an authentic Neapolitan pizzeria and so I consider myself someone who knows how to judge a good pizza when I see one. The basil was fresh and fragrant, the sauce and dough were just right. I believe they use a wood oven, but don't quote me on that.  The service was excellent. I had asked for my margarita pizza to be smothered in arugula and the server had it done for me for no extra cost! Get a main dish with a beer or drink of your choice and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Smash Kitchen is really out of place tucked away in the corner of the strip mall but its got a nice modern interior and good atmosphere. The service was friendly and attentive. I had the grilled calamari to and the LA Mac and Cheese. The calamari was perfectly cooked, not to chewy, and very tasty. The LA Mac and Cheese was delicious, my favourite part of the meal, they had me at \"bacon\" basically. I'm really happy I found this restaurant, will definitely be returning, and maybe I tackle one of their giant burgers."}
{"text":"Really good spot tucked away in a small lil plaza. Great brunch, great place to hang out."}
{"text":"We came here last night to #ordertheyelp (Monday, after 8PM).. the server said it would take a LONG time, up to 30 minutes.. well, I was already here...so... might as well.  We ordered the burger, ribs, margherita pizza and donuts.. interesting thing about Smash was that compared to other restaurants participating in the Order the Yelp, they just offer regular items off the menu at 50% off, pretty amazing deal!  This was my first time at Smash, been wanting to come for a while but never got around to it. The restaurant was pretty busy as they have a Monday special ($10 pizzas).. they also have certain deals Sunday - Thurs.  We ended up waiting over 40 minutes for our food; was getting to the hangry point by now.. soOoo no pictures of the food, it wasn't the prettiest anyway as everything became soggy after being put into takeout boxes and a 20 minute drive home.  Burger: Quite delicious, the smash sauce was a little sweet so I really enjoyed that. The fries were really good though.  Pizza: I think the pizza would've been amazing fresh out of the oven as it was incredibly thin... but it became soggy even after reheating in the oven when I got home.  Ribs: I really enjoyed the ribs, the smashed potatoes were kind of dry and there was really nothing special about the tiny bit of corn.  Donuts: Meh, they were alright but def. not worth the $7 they go for... there were about 7 of them and tasted similar to timbits.  Overall, I may come back to try the food another time but I would definitely not recommend ordering anything to go.. as the food they serve doesn't exactly sit well in takeout containers."}
{"text":"My friend and I had this bookmarked for ages! So glad we went. The decor inside was amazing and very classy. Upon looking at the menu, it was more extensive than expected. I didn't see many different options of food when looking at photos on instagram. The prices also looked high but after getting the food: it was worth it! A lot better than other high end burger/steak/chicken places (ie. Moxies). I got the chickpea burger as I love vegan patties. The flavour was like a mild curry hummus. The patty was very thick but did get crushed while I was eating it since it was very soft. Everything in it was well paired under the soft, fluffy bun. THE SWEET POTATO FRIES I GOT ON THE SIDE WERE THE BEST FRIES I EVER HAD. the dipping sauce was also divine. I'm not sure what it is but my friend said maybe chipotle mayo.   I also got to sample my friends tuna cake. It was tasty and I would definitely get it again. It came with a large salad too. My friends got the monster burger, quinoa salad, and tuna salad. None of us finished our food because the portions were huge! We all enjoyed. Something to note is that the monster burger looked over 10 cm tall."}
{"text":"Good food place is well priced but the staff is slow so four stars only we held three parties here this past year and we come for brunch the slow service is consistent throughout each visit"}
{"text":"Since writing my review, the owner of Smash has personally contacted me and tried to address my comments with a receptive attitude. It's refreshing to see this, and although I have not yet returned for another meal, I'd like to raise my rating based on good faith."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a long while now.. It's been recommended by my friends and they have great reviews. Finally checked it off my bucket list.  Went for dinner on a long weekend Saturday night, RSVP is pretty much a must!  Dinner for 2 was $125, we had a calamari appetizer, full rack of ribs, 12 inch chorizo pizza, 2 sides and 4 drinks.. The service was attentive, nicely staffed! Ambience was great, would recommend for a birthday or date night!  The grilled calamari was great, the Mediterranean dressing was light and healthy.  Ribs were cooked to perfection, no too soft, but still fall off the bone perfection and moist. Finished nicely on the grill with BBQ sauce. Pretty much you standard rib feast quality!  The sausage-goat cheese, basil, rapini 12 inch pizza was an awesome deal for $14. Tasted great, well balanced yummy toppings and think crust. Would definitely come back for pizza!  The LA max and cheese was really good for a side order. But the duck fried rice was the highlight of the night!! If you like Peking duck or risotto or Chinese seafood sauce, then you will like the duck fried rice, if you like all 3 of those things then you will absolutely love the duck friend rice!!! Soooo good!!  I'll be back to try other things on their menu! Props to the executive chef, kitchen staff, and waitress team! Great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Went to Smash Kitchen last Monday.  However, when the waitress first came to our table she did not mention to us what the deals of the day were. We only found out after ordering that they had $10 pizza deal. Other than that, the food we ordered was delici"}
{"text":"Really loved this place, atmosphere, service and food. Went for lunch and can't wait to go back. Had the Fresh Guac and chips, the warm Quinoa salad was amaaaaazing, also their truffle broccoli soup and my friend had the chickpea burger and loved it. Definitely going back. Tucked away but a great Markham Gem!"}
{"text":"The burgers for YELP burger week was very delicious, but they didn't come with a side which was a bit of a turn off. We had a hard time signing in for the $5 burgers, but the servers were incredibly kind and let us pass this time. Service is wonderful there, they are fantastic"}
{"text":"*A nice change from the the usual chinese restaurants in the area, the price was pretty much comparable to other similar restaurants such as Boston Pizza.  *Smash Kitchen & Bar was a bit hidden in a plaza corner where you wouldn't expect there to be a restaurant, and I was quite surprised of how big the space was  *The staffs were extremely friendly, tentative and professional  -BBQ Ribs (Tossed in our signature Smash bbq sauce) - $14:  I thought the meat was tender but not fall off the bone tender. The BBQ sauce was sweet and very flavorful, though I would have liked it a bit more if there was some spicy kick to the sauce.  -Surf & Turf Burger (Atlantic lobster, double patty, cheddar cheese, bacon, tomato, lettuce, basil aioli) - $19 My other friend said his surf and turf was good but it was tough to eat in one bite. I must mention how the bottom bun of these two burgers were extremely thin, hence they soaked up all the juices from the patties and resulted into this huge mess when you try to eat.  -Smash Burger (Cheddar cheese, onion rings, Smash sauce) - $15:  My friend ordered the smash burger and he mentioned how it was just your average and nothing special.   -Angry Lobster Linguini (Lobster tail, arrabiatta sauce, basil pesto, arugula, pico de gallo) - $23 Despite the tiny lobster pieces, for $23 there were a decent amount of lobster incorporated within the pasta. Although the pasta wasn't freshly made in-house and despite being overcooked by a few seconds, I was surprised at how tasty the pasta was! The sauce had a nice kick and acidity to it with some nice small chunks of tomato, and fresh arugula to lighten up the dish. With that said, I didn't find any pico de gallo nor the basil pesto, and I find it strange to have those two with the arrabiantta sauce?"}
{"text":"Came here on weekend late dinner. Very comforting food, best slider I've ever had. Lobster bisque - average. Chicken & ribs - with corn & mash potato. Asked for tabasco sauce the waiter let me try this house special hot sauce that went super well with chicken!"}
{"text":"Food was incredible! Service was awesome! Might have to come back again before leaving back home....so damn good"}
{"text":"Was in Markham for a couple of days and looking for somewhere relaxing to eat and have a beer.  Sat at the bar.  Service was friendly, quick, and had no problems with substitutions on the menu.  Beer was fine. Not a huge selection but the local on tap was good.  Food. Enjoyed  immensely.  In addition to just going there on my own, I'd equally recommend the place for couples or groups of friends. They do get busy at the popular times, so book a table, but certainly a place I'll be returning to when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for brunch so decided to try this place because they have a crab cake benedict which sounded pretty good.  The eggs and pototos were pretty good but thats pretty hard to mess up. The crab cake was a joke, it had big pieces of shrimp inside, i dont even know if i actually tasted crab.  If your gonna do that say so on the menu, shrimp and eggs is a gross combination in my opinion."}
{"text":"Awesome place! The location is a bit sketch so you'll be pleasantly surprised once you enter.  This is a great place for business or with friends.   The service was great and food was amazing.   We split a pizza as an appy which was delicious!  Then I had the ribs and mac.  The ribs were far better than you'd expect from a place like this.  I could go on but really you just need to try it"}
{"text":"4.5 stars  Really enjoyed our dinner here. The service was excellent but it might have been cuz I checked in via Yelp & we also got 10% off our entire meal because of that. Remember to check in! :) Deco was nice, typical of a bar. But I enjoyed the food a lot.   I ordered the Chorizo pizza (Basil pesto, mozzarella, rapini, caramelized onions, goat cheese, pico de gallo - slightly spicy sausage) & absolutely loved it. The crust was thin & crispy (exactly how I like it) and combination of the ingredients was very tasty! The portions in general were also generous and I had to pack half my pizza home! I love not making lunch for work the next day!  Also got to taste the crab cake (may not have been entirely crab) but it was fried nicely and tasted good w/ the dipping sauce. I got to sample a bite of my hubby's burger and it was very nice and juicy! Cooked perfectly.   Prices in general was very reasonable. There are also daily specials! Mondays - $10 pizza, Tuesday - $10 smash burgers & $4 Molson pints, etc. I will definitely be back again!   Lots of parking"}
{"text":"This place never fails to deliver great food. It's a nice environment and the decor on the inside is nice. It's upscale casual dining with great service and great food. I've been here both for brunch and dinner. They have a delicious brunch! I think prices are fairly reasonable, even if they are on the higher end. I would say this place is one of my favourite restaurants in Markham. I have never had a bad experience there and would definitely return."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch on my birthday, we had a group with kids and the staff were very helpful and friendly. They knew how to keep the kids busy by providing crayons and colouring paper. We had smash burger, eggs bene with crab cakes, waffles. The kids loved their pizza and grill cheese. Everything was delish and portions were pretty big too. I liked that since we all had coffee the waiters gave us a few pots of coffee on our table so that we can help ourselves. We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"i've only been here once and never had the desire to come back. not because the food or anything was bad but nothing stood out either. until yesterday when i came for a belated mother's day dinner at the request of my mother since she loved the ribs she had here. we ordered the seafood cake, full rack of bbq ribs, truffle mac and cheese, buttermilk fried chicken, donuts and poseidon pizza. everything arrived at our table together after 10 minutes of ordering. IMPRESSED! everything arrived hot and delicious. my mom was happy!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday for lunch and it was pretty busy. Menu is similar to Joeys, Moxies or Milestones. Each day has a different deal and Monday was $10 pizzas.  The food was great, we started with a \"Take it to the Greek\" pizza which had chicken, arugula, sun dried tomatoes and peppers. The crust was super thin but really crispy. Toppings were all fresh and worked really together.  For my main, I tried the mushroom chicken gnocchi. The gnocchi was pretty good, and loaded with mushrooms. It's definitely a heavier dish so make sure you have space!  I was too full after having these two but would definitely go back to try other dishes. Service was friendly and fast. Recommended!"}
{"text":"I've always heard about this place and finally get to try it today! We wanted to come in for brunch but missed it by just a bit (I think they end brunch around 12 and then switch to lunch / dinner menu).   We tried the broccoli tempura, caesar salad, duck fried rice and the smash burger. Smash burger was pretty tasty though more greasy than I expected and not as hot, suggesting it was sitting around for a bit. The duck fried rice was pretty good, though the rice wasn't the traditional rice found in fried rice but like the instant rice thats like slippery, bigger than regular jasmine rice, and soft. The salad tasted almost like regular Caesar salad but slightly more rich. Finally the broccoli tempura was better than the usual tempura because it had this special sauce that was a bit spicy but made it really tasty.  I'd definitely come back to try it out, it's food is definitely better than you typical comfort food restaurant. The prices are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"The lobster tacos are great, the rest of the menu is average.... Their price point is a little high for the area"}
{"text":"ENVIRONMENT It's located slightly hidden in the plaza, I was surprised to find that a restaurant opened up here. The interior is nice.. Kinda sportsbar like, and very spacious - you wont be able to tell from the outside. It's refreshing to see such a restaurant in Markham.  Service didnt feel rushed, and it wasnt too busy when I went on Saturday 11AM. Wait time is minimal.  FOOD The benedicts were not bad. There's an option to have a $20 brunch combo in which you get the brunch entree (benedict, omelette etc), coffee/tea and a dessert (ie cheesecake). I tried the combo with the crab cakes benedict and the boy got the florentine benedict. I felt the crab cakes were a little too..flavourful and hearty.. But that may just be me in the morning. Cheesecake was not bad as well. Hence three stars, nothing really stood out to me, but I am glad more of these restaurants are opening up in Markham and they serve brunch!"}
{"text":"It has been 2 years since my last update and honestly, I have nothing but praises about Smash Kitchen :) It is still my favourite spot for comfort food with a special flare in Markham. I continue to recommend Smash every occasion possible. I do not work for Smash but I truly stand by their overall quality.  The restaurant has grown and improved beyond my expectations during these couple of years. Menu is constantly changing, and weekly food specials are always exciting to try! My absolute favourite was the Shrimp and Grits they had a while back, and it was just heavenly. Do take advantage of their weekly drink specials. The Thursdays 1/2 price bottled wine special is worth coming back to lol.  Some of my all time favourites: - Beef brisket grilled sandwich - Truffle mac and cheese :D - Mushroom linguine - Seafood paella - Neptune pizza - Duck fried rice ('rice' made with orzo!) - Ahi tuna wonton - Chocolate banana and toffee cake :3 - Well, pretty much all the desserts lol  This place is always buzzling with people, so be sure to make a reservation! They can accommodate large groups - I have organized family outings, birthday celebrations, Christmas function, brunch for bridal shower here before and Smash has been amazing and very accommodating, thank you :D I heard they did a private event for wedding a couple months back too! And parking is never an issue - I get asked that a lot lol.  Thank you for always being so with patient with me and my crew, especially at the end of the night. It seems like we never like to leave (you can always send Manny over and boot us lol.) But Smash just feels like home to us :) I don't live in Markham, that's why this is always our fave spot to meet, catch up and have a great meal. No hard feelings, right?  P.S. We love you lots, Manny :D  P.P.S. The negative reviews on Yelp seemed to majorly target Lobster mac and cheese. This is a very popular item itself and often the first thing people would order... but yours definitely needs revision. The regular mac and cheese is definitely a hit... why wouldn't the lobster? Go big or go home - people are willing to pay for it if there are more chunky meats (less the fancy tail)! Easier said then done, I know (and I'm no restaurateur!) But hopefully you can work the magic!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with a group of 9 and a baby. Made reservations for dinner same day on a weekday. It is a fine restaurant for kids. The noise level is pretty loud and the restaurant is lighted a bit dark but I had no issues. A plus for the noise? A crying baby. Nobody heard, complained and asked us to leave!  The kids (three) ordered from the kids menu which included a pretty good sized \"smash\" burger and fries and chicken fingers and veggies. The prices ($13) aren't great for kids meals. I don't recall what the other guests in our party ordered, I think the Smash burger special ($12 on Wed night), the tuna salad, and the chicken cobb salad. They also ordered the Chorizo tacos. I did not hear any complaints about the food. I had the BBQ Beef Brisket Grilled Cheese ($16) and my husband had the Chorizo pizza ($16). Both dishes were good. My grilled cheese was tasty after the first bite but I tasted mostly the BBQ brisket and the sauce was sweet. Not a lot of cheese though but good crust on the grilled cheese. If you aren't a fan of sweet savoury dishes (like my husband), then this dish is terrible, however I like sweet so I liked it. However, if you let this sandwich go a bit cold, it's horrible. The bread becomes very hard and stale tasting. Maybe they could make homemade bread? The pizza was pretty good between myself and my husband. The goat cheese, chorizo, buffalo mozzarella were all good. I didn't really taste the advertised pico de gallo and basil chimichurri.   Overall, prices are average (between $12-28) for entrees. The food was alright, wasn't horrible but wasn't amazing either. Our waitress was pretty nice. The restaurant was also pretty busy for a weekday dinner. I also appreciated the many many TV's in the restaurant, which played sports. I read good things about the brunch here on Yelp so I definitely want to come back for that. Other than that, if I have a large group, I wouldn't be against coming back but there are other Canadian/American (traditional) restaurant/bars I would try in the area before having to come back to this one."}
{"text":"Been going to smash since 3 years ago. Haven't been in a year and the food and service has definitely downgraded. I remember the buttermilk chicken was to die for and I raved about it everywhere I went but when I came back the buttermilk fried chicken tasted just like chicken fingers I would get from A&W. The desserts I ordered as well were gross to the point I only took one bite out of it.   Mind you, I waited 10-15 minutes until someone came about to finally take our order. I don't have the patience to come back and give this place another try.   Sadly never coming back."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Markham. Great ribs! Buttermilk fried chicken is to dieeee for!  Brunch is great as well.  Pizza Mondays $10 Smash burger $10 Ayce ribs Wednesday Half price wine Thursday"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my fav burger places! Good full filling tasty burgers .  Their atmosphere is great and romantic. Their bar selections is not bad Their choices and selections have alot of varieties  I love their salads too they have this steak salad you should definitely try it out The line is generally very long could range from 30-40mins So its better if you do reserve one or two days prior."}
{"text":"Came back to Smash, this time to try out their dinner menu. I had the ribs special, while my bf had the fried chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries.   First off, portions are massive! I thought the prices were on the high side until I saw our plates. Come hungry, or be prepared to have leftovers.   I was also much more impressed with the food this time around. The ribs were well-sauced and done well, fall-off-the-bone but still with a bit of bite. The side of brussel sprouts went well with the ribs. The fried chicken sandwich was a crunchy, meaty, two-fisted mess, in a good way.   Overall, very satisfying meal!"}
{"text":"Tucked into a little corner in the plaza. Came here late night on a Sunday and we ended up here on a whim. It was sangria sundays for $6.00. So we definitely tried it out. The restaurant was not super busy, a few birthday parties, but not crowded. We ordered the calamari as we waited for our other friend to show up.   Once we came we ordered the firecracker shrimp, lobster mac and cheese and the Poseidon pizza. They were ALL DELICIOUS! Nothing I can complain about in the taste area.   Poseidon Pizza - Tomato cream sauce, buffalo mozzarella, Italian bacon, lobster, tiger shrimp, roasted garlic, arugula  - Everything tied together really well.   Firecracker Shrimp - Bacon wrapped & lightly battered, sriracha maple tossed, pink peppercorns, scallions, potato hay - Big in portion and seasoned extremely well.  Lobster Mac & Cheese - Tomato cheese sauce, Atlantic lobster, pico de gallo, herb crusted - This is big for one person. I am really glad that we decided to share because for one person that would be tooo much. I would come back just for this.   Overall, it was great and I would come back again"}
{"text":"Hubby and I went for dinner here last night and it was fantastic! We had the rose sangria, cheese croquettes, bbq chicken pizza, rack of ribs with cornbread and mac and cheese, and the mini donuts for dessert. The food was so delicious, the portions were very generous and the service was fast even though it was really busy! Our server was named Lauren and she was so friendly and making jokes! We will definitely back!!"}
{"text":"I love their brunch, ribs and Mac & cheese! sooo good..."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars After hearing tons of people talking about Smash, I finally went to try! Upon entering, it was pretty empty since I came at the awkward 3pm which is right after the lunch rush. You are greeted by some friendly waitresses and left to gawk at the awesome interior of the place. It's classy and casual at the same time. I feel like you could walk in with jeans or a little black dress. It reminded me of moxies, but with a classier and more upscale design. Now onto the food.... Since I came with my friend who was starving, we mostly shared a few dishes, mostly appetizers.  Let me start with the truffle mac and cheese though. This is the bomb. I usually don't indulge in mac and cheese but...... this was so creamy and decadent. The truffle definitely upgraded it to another level. The pasta that they used was shaped like a fancy swirl. It was served on a skillet for aesthetic purposes (and to keep it hot). This was definitely a highlight, but not for the fainthearted, i could feel my arteries clogging. The Calamari appetizer was quite good as well, the batter was light buttermilk and really complimented the dish, there were two sauces that were served with it. One was creamy and the other was more of a tomato sauce. Both were delish! The Guac & Chips were good but nothing to brag about. price was a bit steep, but the guac was a LOT that I ended up taking some home. **the guac was very fresh and this would be a good healthy option** Lastly, The Tomato and Corn Soup was good, but I'm not the biggest fan of thick soups. I like more of a brothy consistency but the flavour was blasting in the soup and was great with some bread dipped in it.  Overall, the food was quite good and my bill came in just short of 60 dollars. The waitresses are very witty and made the experience very comfortable.  I would definitely be back to try out their pizzas and other mac & cheese ( they have a lobster one that i'm eyeing rn)"}
{"text":"Had so much hopes for this place because of the reviews and from friends. The place was great. Nice atmosphere and everyone was super friendly. The food was awesome. This honestly would've been a solid 4.5 stars if it wasn't for our waiter. The waiter gave me and my boyfriend this vibe that he didn't like us. When we were ordering, I asked him about the menu, he answered it like I just asked the most stupidest question. And when we finished with our meal, my boyfriend went to the washroom, so he came by and asked if we wanted to look at the dessert menu and I said no thanks, we were really full. Then he goes on and collected the plates and then came by and just threw the bill on our table and goes on to the other tables. I found that so rude. This was the first time that I experience such disgusting manners. I didn't ask for the bill yet cause I was waiting for my boyfriend to come back then pay.   I wanted to come back for lunch or brunch but I'm not sure if I would come back to this place again."}
{"text":"This place is probably pretty awesome if you're not gluten free. We stopped in for brunch and literally the only gluten free option was a Cobb salad. Ah the salad thing again. I thought those days were gone as gluten free becomes more normal. The salad was good, the decor was pretty snazzy and my friends all enjoyed their food immensely (poached eggs for one and burgers with sweet potato fries for the other two). Even the bathrooms were really nice!  So if you aren't gluten free - you'll likely really enjoy yourself here. If you are, I'd skip it. The Cobb salad was really good, but I rarely go out and willingly get a salad. So I won't be back for the reason alone."}
{"text":"I got the egg benny for brunch. The meal arrived quickly. Honestly though, the hollandaise sauce was the highlight of the meal!!!!   The hollandaise sauce was delicious - super creamy and buttery. The poached egg was cooked perfectly. However, I wish they gave more fruits than potato wedges.   We got seated and served promptly. The waiter was really attentive, so that's a plus!"}
{"text":"I came here with a group from work at the recommendation of one of my coworkers. The venue is pretty large, and it gets crowded - we had to sit at the bar. The ambiance is nice, with modern styling and dim lighting. The service was friendly and timely. However, I wasn't a big fan of the food. I had the smash burger, which was fine, but certainly not great vs. many other burgers I've had. The fries and the side soup were also a bit bland - not very well seasoned. Same with the sangria - it tasted watered down. Overall, this is a nice venue, and the food is passable, but nothing I'd write home about."}
{"text":"Eggs Benny was amazing and the French toast taste like cake.  The line up is longer than expected but it's worth it"}
{"text":"Came for a bachelorette dinner and everyone enjoyed their food. Since I'm allergic to shellfish I couldn't try the lobster dishes I had a salad instead with the BBQ chicken. It was really good and the rest of our group enjoyed their meals (they ordered the surf and turf burgers, lobster linguini, lobster Mac and cheese, and the fried chicken and ribs). It's a nice place for groups! Prices are fair, portions are good, service was nice."}
{"text":"We came here an hour before closing and was sold on their \"last\" family platter. For $60, you get 2 buttermilk biscuits, 2 grilled corns, 6 small pieces of ribs (really small), 1 fried chicken and 1 sausage with Mac N cheese. My advice is, it's not really worth it specially if you come at the end of the day because you will get all the reject and left over pieces that didn't sell out during the day!  The ribs were all end pieces with some burnt tips.  The quality of the meat was in consistent and you can tell it came from different slabs of ribs.  My piece tasted like it's been sitting there for days while my husband said his was delicious. He took a bite of mine and immediately said, that's a bad piece.   We also ordered the lobster pizza which barely had any lobster. The salad dressing on the quinoa portobello salad was tasteless and did nothing to enhance the flavours ingredients.  The burger and grill cheese brisket was not bad.   Our server was really friendly but he forgot about one of our sides. He made it up by putting sparklers on our fried donuts. I thought that was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Great place in Unionville. The menu is amazing. Check it out. It's between Main Street and the new Markham downtown area. Ribs, burgers and pasta is great here."}
{"text":"Service is sub par at best. Convenient location for me but not my first choice. Made reservations for 8:30 but didn't get seated until 9:15pm. Food did not come at the same time, and had to send back my food because they made an error. Have tried most things on the menu, food was better during my first visit 2 years ago for my birthday. Seems to lack freshness. Chicken on my pizza tasted stale and old."}
{"text":"I usually make a few visits before I decide to write a review.  Mostly because I am a small business owner myself and I don't want to provide negative feedback based on one experience. I would not like a customer of mine to judge my business based on one interaction either.   My first experience here was so positive that I feel very comfortable writing some things down right away.  I travelled further than usual to find the Smash Bar. Once I arrived I was surprised at how understated the exterior is. It's tucked away in the back of a plaza with very plain looking signage.  Once inside the atmosphere and decor compare well with a Milestones Moxies or Earls.  The menu is extensive. I was having a very hard time making a choice so I asked for a recommendation from the server. The server was great. Very attentive and filled every tiny request. Never failing to remember a detail.   The suggestion he gave me was ribs and Mac and cheese. Two things I had been considering pretty hard anyways..  So that was an easy sell.   I am a bit of a bbq and especially a rib snob. So I'll hold my opinion of the ribs for now.  However..  The Mac and Cheese was perfect!!  So flavorful and perfect in texture. I will go back for that alone. In addition everything that came with my ribs was top notch. Roasted corn and coleslaw are so yummy.   So how's the ribs?  Well. Not the greatest. They were not horrible. But most of the flavor was by way of sauce. Rather than a good marinade or a rub... Or a smoker!  I would probably choose something else next time.   All that being said...  This was a very positive dining experience. I would make the tri"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant. They smashed it out of the park each time I've been here (twice).   First time was for the BBQ ribs (all you can eat on wed evenings in the summer) and it was one of the best ribs I've had. So tender and juicy, I couldn't stop eating. It came with a side of mashed potatoes and corn which was awesome.   This time around I went for brunch and it was a very good idea. I got the smash Benedict which was amazing! ($15) definitely something I would highly recommend. My friend got the crab cake Benedict and it was divine ($15) and my other friend got the eggs Florentine ($13) which was also lip smack worthy. You have the option to do a fixed price of $20 (entree with coffee/tea and a dessert) not a bad deal because the dessert is $7. Options: New York cheesecake, fresh berries with whipped cream and chocolate mouse).   Dessert not the best -- fruit was not that fresh and the cheesecake was mediocre.... But let's just concentrate on the food which was a showstopper.  One day I came for the chicken and waffles. Not too heavy and with a citrus syrup which was surprisingly delicious! Unfortunately not enough syrup. It was like a very light drizzle. The waffle was amazing, chicken was decent. Just not enough food!!! I was still hungry after I finished $17  Would definitely come back again and again and again..."}
{"text":"I was at Smash for dinner on Tuesday evening (March 15) and I just wanted to commend them on the essence of their delicious cuisine and inviting atmosphere. Our sever was super pleasant and engaging (sadly I do no recall her name). Everything was to perfection - from the starters all the way through to the dessert. The quality of the food was outstanding and they were extremely accommodating to meet any dietary needs.  I dine out frequently and Smash was a magnificent experience.  I'm looking forward to returning.   Thanks for making a great first impression!"}
{"text":"Service: 4 Food: 5 Decor: 4  We've been here for weekend brunch and dinner with friends and family. We were never disappointed by their food especially the Mac n cheese!  If you order their steak, make sure to ask for medium rare as it's usually a little bit over cooked but still taste good!  If possible, try to make reservations especially on the weekend because it's usually jam packed. It's definitely good for big gatherings as you get your own room if you make reservation ahead of time. This provides more privacy as it does get a bit loud out in the dining room and bar.  Prices are fairly reasonably if you compare with other steakhouse and you get quite a variety of options. Considering the location its definitely worth going if you want something different."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time returning! Should have known better as the first time around it was for my sisters birthday! I had called to remind them but nothing was done, not even a mentioned of happy birthday!  As the first time around, I ordered their Richmond Hill version of the winterlicious menu back in October so did not get to use my travelzoo! First off their Antipasto, came with several hard bricks of Parmesan cheese, how do they expect us to eat them? Worst was it said prosciutto and all they gave us was several slices of what appears to be Black Forest Ham! After speaking with the waitress, the manager came to explain that it was actually Capicola and they had ran out of Prosciutto on the line so he went back and somehow managed to give us a few sliver of the precious prosciutto on a seperate plate on top of some arugula!   Next came our main, the 12oz ribeye, both of us ordered the same med rare! However one came out super salty and practically medium well vs one was under-seasoned RARE! The mash potatoes came out grainy as if it's got sand inside! Blah! If it wasn't for the fact that I had to use the travelzoo I would not be coming back!   Really want to just put 1 star, however our waitress we had was very nice and attentive! She gave  us good suggestions to having the banana toffee cake, which was tad bit on the sweet side but otherwise delish! !   Oh and the 2oz Martini was a ripoff coz either the liquor was watered down or they didn't put in alcohol! As usually I am very much of a lightweight and gets super red as simple as one sip of alcohol however the Martini had no effect on me whatsoever! Argh!  Two bad experiences is more than enough!! There are so many yummy restaurant would NOT recommend this place! Be warned! 2 words; Go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday; they do offer a small dessert/surprise kinda thing for birthday people so if you're interested be sure to ask the staff. They are pretty nice, and they try to accommodate you as best they can. The place can get busy though, so some gentle reminders might be needed.   Decor is very modern and the place itself is quite large; lots of seating available in either these round-looking booths, or your normal tables. They also have a bar area with high chairs so it's good for dinner or a drink meet up (or one after the other). The lighting is a tad dark at night for my liking so if you're looking for any picture moments you might need more light.  Be sure to try their pizza if you come here. Personal fave was the Neptune pizza; thin and crispy crust, aromatic and flavourful ingredients. Not a fan of balsamic but the light drizzle they had on it was ok. Portion is big enough for 2-3 people imo. And because it's so thin, it doesn't make you feel super bloated and you can actually eat other stuff; presentation was also very nice. Could use a bit more cheese.   Another must try is their Calamari; very light, fluffy and crispy on the outside with a good amount of spices, and fresh and tender on the inside. Good starter to have.  The NY Striploin was a good portion; perfectly cooked on the outside and the inside was tender and juicy. Not the 'best' steak in town but a good one.   The Mushroom Linguine is a pretty good option for the veggies out there; the portion however is solely meant for one person so don't even think about sharing it unless you're only giving away one bite.   They have a good number of items on their menu where each category is not overwhelmingly filled with a huge number of dishes, but enough to have your pick. Prices are decent and in general pretty balanced with what you get. Good for groups or casual dates but might want to book a table as waiting can get long, especially on weekends."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on a Saturday afternoon.  The only menu option was the brunch menu but it did not disappoint!  The location is somewhat hidden in the crevice of the strip mall. Once you enter through the doors, you instantly forget how crappy the exterior is.   Well lit, clean and modern looking. Staff all seemed happy to be there and we were also greeted (on the way out) by someone that appeared to be the owner.   The booths are spacious and somewhat private. Once we sat down, all the sights and sounds around us slowly disappeared.    We ordered the French toast and mushroom bacon omelet. Take a look at my photos, the portion sizes are huge!  But in a good way!  We didn't get an abundance of food, but definitely enough to feel really full by the end of the meal.   The French toast, as the menu states, are challah blocks, literally!  It almost tastes like a cinnamon donut. It was really good.   The omelet was fresh and packed with toppings. Cheesy, and plenty of mushrooms.  The hash browns (potatoes) were crispy and hot. The additional side toast wasn't needed.   Overall this was a great experience. We'll definitely be coming back. We've heard great things about their dinner menu items, especially the burgers!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Ian somewhat proud of this place. The environment was trendy and all the employees there were professional. The food was amazing and came in a timely fashion. the manger came by our table and greeted us. I thought that was very nice of him to do so. The only bad thing is that I haven't noticed this place till now since it is located in the corner of the plaza. It is quite hard to find especially if it is your first time going there."}
{"text":"Tldr: Great tasting comfort food, awesome service, on the pricier end, would recommend!  I've been here a couple times for birthday dinners and this place is amazing. Smash offers delicious options like pizza, chicken and ribs, burgers, mac and cheese, as well as sandwiches.   When i come here i usually get the chicken and ribs...It's pretty much the best of both worlds. The ribs are meaty (fall off the bone baby!), accompanied by their signature bbq sauce that is sweet and savory in it's beautifully unique way. The buttermilk chicken you ask? It's nice and crisp on the outside and MOIST on the inside. In my opinion you can't go wrong with their juicy and flavorful fried chicken even if you just get it by itself. On my last visit i tried the lobster mac and cheese. It was baked in a cast iron, and oh man was it cheesy. It was dense, creamy and packed with considerably large lobster pieces. They did not skimp out on the lobster at all.   The service here is awesome as well. Food comes in a very reasonable time, and the servers are super friendly. They really make your dining experience quite comfortable at Smash. Great tasting food and excellent service does come with a price though. The chicken and ribs are $29 and the lobster mac and cheese was $24. This is the reason why i don't come here often, but when i do it's always a treat. Highly recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Coworkers and I came here during our lunch break. We told them exactly what we were ordering and told them we were in a hurry.  The server understood and quickly went away with our orders. In a timely fashion, he returned 15 mins later with our food.  Wow.  Everything tasted sublime and was cooked perfectly. I ordered the fried chicken entree while my coworkers ordered the fried chicken sandwich and warm steak salad.  The fried chicken was cooked perfectly with a crispy skin and juicy thigh meat. It paired very well with the chicken gravy that accompanied it. I also really enjoyed how it was paired with some arugula, adding a nice peppery and fresh flavour.  The corn bread was crispy on the outside and soft on the outside with just the right amount of sweetness. Next time, I'm ordering a basket of them as an appetizer.  And the mac and cheese ... yum. I am NOT a mac and cheese person, but their mac and cheese was buttery, creamy, and rich. It's probably the best mac and cheese I've had so far in Toronto. The noodles were al dente, the sauce coated each of them seductively and each mouthful was better than the next.  By the end of our meal, I was stuffed. I really wanted to order a dessert, but I physically couldn't eat anymore.  It's definitely on the pricey side, but worth every penny. My coworkers all enjoyed their meals too so we will be back again!"}
{"text":"It was my best friend's birthday and I wanted to treat her to brunch. This place was in between us and we wanted to try it for the longest time. The place was super packed when we got there, they only had the bar and high top tables available at the moment. The bar was actually super nice so we got seated there.   We were immediately greeted by our server Nicole, sick tattoos btw. I've asked her about their mimosas and she said there were different types of mimosas that they can make. She listed them all and introduced this blueberry lavender mimosa that was pureeeeeeeee delicious and amazing. It was definitely something that we both haven tried before. The taste of it was just amazing and perfect for brunch.   I've ordered the eggs Benedict and my best friend ordered the crab cake Benedict's. The food came super quickly and I was super impressed at how our server kept checking up on us and even filling up our cups with water without disturbing us!   Let's talk food. My eggs Benedict was amaaaaaaazing. Delicious, I wish they were more generous with the hollandise sauce but overall it was great. The smashed potatoe hash browns were sooooo perfect. Crispy, hot and soft in the inside. I loved how they also sautéed other veggies with the hash. It was delicious. I think I would get the crab cake Benedict's next time, my friend said it was amazing and something she has never ordered before.   When I asked for the bill, Nicole our server totally surprised us with a birthday treat for my friend. We were so awed with the surprise that it totally made our day. Plus we would definitely be coming back just to snack on those donuts. It was pure goodness.   Can't wait to try their fried chicken next time.  Happy eating fellow yelpers!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. A unique layout. Their choice in appetizers is great. The L.A Mac and Cheese is amazing, so rich and delicious. Their sundried tomato and spinach dip is excellent. The sun dried tomatoes over power the flavour of the spinach, but its still a great dish. The only dish i would give a 2.5 out of 5 is the Bbq fire chicken breast. The chicken was really dry and not very flavourful. Other then that the atmosphere is great, the owner and staff are very welcoming. Great place to eat and relax!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Markham. The plaza is kind of on it's own, the restaurant is the back corner and the sign isn't obvious.   The food was amazing! Their eggs florentine was just right and I loved their fruit kabob! Their home fries are a bit on the saltier side though.  The service was friendly and quick, which was nice, especially since it was busy. The decor just reminds me of a place you'd go for a first date in high school.   Besides those little things, this is definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"I'd love to give this place  bit better rating.. but I must say the waitstaff just need to cheer up. The manager though did make his rounds which I can appreciate as customer satisfaction did seem to be important. But as most interaction is with the waitress; she just seemed either out of it or just not in any mood to deal with any social interaction,   Besides that; I must say if your deciding between Kelseys or Jack Astors; Choose Smash Kitchen & BAR, Similar atmosphere but not a franchise helping it give a personal touch and giving the menu a by far better appeal. The food was more than decent and the pricing was not too bad. Cannot say im obsessed but not a bad choice for a quick bite and drinks with friends! Def give it a try!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites when I'm in the area on business. Taco night is a must and their other food is really good too. Great drink specials."}
{"text":"First time here , love the experience here . Good deal on monday to wednesday . Friendly stuff and nice envoirment.   I ll come back for sure .  My family and i came on a tuesday night,  which they have taco special from $3 up ( compare to regular menu ,taco is $1 off )  taste not bad at all , we also tried the rib tower for $20 from the appitze menu.  If you dont need any side like salad ,fries or soup , just dont bother to pay $5 extra for thr rib from the main menu.  The size of the rib tower is good for a person as the main entee ."}
{"text":"Well done. Ordered quite a bit and everything was great. Duck tacos, lobster pizza, fried chicken, ribs, and 3 of the desserts (donuts, toffee cake and carrot cake). Our server, Andrew, was attentive, funny and knowledgeable. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"A friend of mine took me out for brunch for my birthday from the time we walked in everyone was super friendly. We sat at the bar, the bartender was super friendly and definitely knew her stuff. The prices for the food and drinks are very good compared to what I usually would pay at most places. I had the crab cake egg benedict, can I just say it was amazing and I would recommend everyone to try it when go there. From the service, food, and drinks I'm defenitely going back there.   decent foThe food was amazing...... loved it"}
{"text":"Came back to try the chicken waffle! Had a friend dislike the spicy citrus maple syrup, tried it, thought it wasn't bad. A suggestion would be to maybe add a bit of coleslaw to the dish? Chicken was good and waffle was soft and lightly crispy. I would say I've had better but overall, it was alright.   If you're looking for a healthy brunch option, cobb salad would be the way to go. Loaded with lots of vegetables and chicken but the chicken was a little dry for my liking. Other than that, pretty good!   New York cheesecake and chocolate mousse were delicious. Nothing out of the ordinary but no complaints either :)"}
{"text":"I came here a few days ago because of the reviews i had read about this place.  First off, thank you Yelp, by checking in a received 10% off my entire bill. Not much but better than nothing.   I ordered 'The Monster'  I can't even remember what was in it but i do remember 2 fried eggs, onion rings, and either 2 beef patties, or 1 beef pattie + sliced meat of some sort?  Also had a side of fries.  The burger was good, but i have to admit, it was not spectacular like i expected it to be. I wanted to be able sink my mouth into the burger for the first time and then figuring out what kind of sorcery was going on inside my mouth, but it didn't happen. Nothing about it really stood out or made it special or unique in it's own way."}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place anymore.  I've been and tried this place for a few times. I came out feeling the same; their services are horrible and the food is okay only (their coffee sux). Its quite a disappointment dining experience each time as matter of fact."}
{"text":"Been here twice, mostly recently last Saturday night. There's still a few items on the menu I reaallly want to try (including the enticing brunch menu), but I've been pretty impressed so far.  ATMOSPHERE:  Place was completely packed on a Saturday night - I imagine this place fills quickly, but they really do a good job of structuring seating in a way that maximizes capacity while also allowing a comfortable distance between tables. There's also more private dining rooms/areas for larger parties. Seems like a great place to dine or just grab drinks with friends.  SERVICE:  Despite being as busy as they were, our server was surprisingly quick with the food, and prompt in responding to any requests we had. He took the time to answer our questions, and offer us input.   FOOD:  Went with the the lobster roll, and the \"Smash Burger.\" Was surprised to see the lobster roll come in mini-slider style. I prefer a buttered bun, for taste, and also it makes it easier to hold in the goods on the inside. The lobster meat and sauce though was still good - could perhaps use a bit more seasoning to spice it up a little. Unsurprisingly, the restaurant's namesake burger was pretty damn good - it reminded me a lot of a higher quality and larger Big Mack, with the cheese, onion rings, and \"special sauce.\" Obviously the patty was much thicker, juicer, and more savoury. Only downside, again with the bun,  is that it got soggy pretty fast.   VERDICT:  Will definitely be back to try the brunch, and a few other items I missed!"}
{"text":"Here is what i think makes this place popular: 1. it serves proper brunch 2. it serves brunch in a neighbourhood that is predominantly asian and asian restaurants dont do \"brunch\" 3. they have chicken and waffles  The food here is quite average. It's neither bad nor panties fall down amazeballs. It's just...good non-asian food, if that's a category - burgers, sandwiches, pizza, salads. For brunch, you got omelettes, more eggs, more salad, and chicken and waffles. I have had better chicken and waffles, but i have not had better chicken and waffles in markham/unionville because they hardly exist.   It's a great, safe place for decent safe food that everyone will enjoy so i can see why it's so popular as a meeting spot. I probably will be back a lot more since i seem to come here at least once every time im back in town."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here on Sunday night with a group of 8. The food was delicious, the service was amazing.  I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Four stars says it all, I'm a fan! Came here for the first time a few weeks ago with my friend and again just last week with my boyfriend. I was equally satisfied both times. It has become one of my favourite western comfort food places in the Markham area!   Service and Environment Definitely make sure you make reservations especially during Fridays! I had to sit at the bar the two times I've been here because they were completely full or booked. Moreover, service was great. The server/bartender at the bar is really friendly and always makes sure everyone is doing well. The food also comes out fairly quick (~15 minute wait). I'd say the ambience of this place is casual, cozy with a bit of class. It's definitely a great place for date nights or special occasions!  Food Lobster Mac & Cheese - This was definitely one of my favourite menu items! Mac and cheese was creamy and baked to perfection. They were also very generous with the amount of lobster meat that was incorporated into the dish. I also loved how they added some bread crumbs on the top to give it an extra crunchy texture completing the dish perfectly.  Full Rack BBQ Ribs - OMG the ribs were so tender that the meat was falling off the bone! What made them even more delicious was the sweet and savoury BBQ sauce that they were marinaded with. I also loved how it was served with freshly chopped corn and mashed potatoes.   Piri Piri Cornish Hen GF - This was a pretty standard dish but not the best. The grilled half hen was very juicy and tender and the chimichurri sauce complemented it well. I wasn't a fan of the seasonal vegetables that was served that day, it was some greens that tasted too bitter for me."}
{"text":"Walking through the front doors of this place, is instantly impressive even though the hostess booth is a somewhat hidden and you're not sure if u should wait to be seated or not.   Servers are cute and friendly, decor is warm and inviting ...sadly, it's downhill from there.   - We were seated at the back area near the washrooms, it was drafty and cold.  - We didn't see our server very often.  - The Mac n Cheese with Lobster is a pasta in a rose sauce over-loaded with shredded cheese and rubbery over-boiled chunks of Lobster for $22!! - beef-cheek poutine with hardly any cheese and gelatinous gloppy gravy. - Fountain Coke was flat and had to order a bottle which isn't refilled.  - Weird lighting in that area was hard on the eyes.   Had heard good things about this place from friends, but it was a bust for us and we won't be going back.    Only gave 2 stars Bcus it's pretty inside and the servers were sweethearts."}
{"text":"The french toast is out of this world! You don't even need syrup! I ate them plain with a side of pea meal bacon. Delicious."}
{"text":"Updated review based on brunch - dinner good, brunch....not so much   I've come here twice for brunch. I love that they take resos and there is parking and usually easy to get a seat even if we just walk in.  I don't love...the food. Both times the bunch was meh and was on the edge of being pretty bad. First time I got a benny and the eggs were way overcooked but also watery (?? like they didn't drain them?), the potatoes were scarce and everything was cold and bland. Second time I thought I would try the crab cake benny at the advice of our service. The crab cakes were disgusting and squishy and watery and bland and where's the crab? and just plain gross. Eggs were almost totally raw this time (runny yolk yum. runny whites gross) and had the same scarce, cold, dry, hard, need to wash down with water potatoes. I barely ate half it was so off-putting.   Not expensive but definitely not cheap. and food was terrible.   I may go back for dinner if someone asks me there, but after these brunch disasters, I think smash kitchen is off my list."}
{"text":"Honestly, one of my favourite local eats! I came here with my friend for breakfast. I got the crab cake which were quite filling. Near the end I just couldn't eat anymore, and sadly had to leave the rest. When entering the restaurant, they posted so many of the \"Yelp loves us\" stickers and immediately we knew it was going to be a great place. The servers were also really nice and they were very helpful. A downside to this would be that the servers don't tell you there's a price for the coffee... they ask you and they charge you when you say yes."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the apps from Smash, my favourite being the seafood cakes . The cake comes with a sauce similar to tartar and tomatoes on the side.   Went on a Tuesday for dinner when they had tacos on special, I wasn't wowed but satisfied. The calamari came in a sauce that was a little too salty for my liking. I've also tried the ribs but once again not wowed.   I would come again just for the cakes!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars  I really want to love Smash Kitchen & Bar and support local small business, but Smash is really missing something that makes me want to go back any time soon.  Smash Kitchen & Bar takes over the space that used to be Bluestone (RIP). If I didn't see the menu, I would have thought it is an identical restaurant as not much had been done in redecorating or renovating the place.  The cocktails menu is quite interesting with some twist to the all time favourites are priced from $7.   Citrus Caipininha ($7) -  cachaca, blood orange, freshly squeezed citrus, maple syrup and citrus curl is quite delicious and cooling, especially in a hot summer evening.  Smash Sliders ($11) the patties are pan fried but cooked with a little pink inside and quite moist.  Brick Chicken ($20) is the best thing we ordered. The chicken is moist and tender and smokey!! Even the white meat is surprising well flavoured. Too bad they over grilled the asparagus and where's my chipotle roasted corns?  Seafood Linguini ($18) though no extra cost to substitute for whole wheat is a bad move. The waitress did not advise us that only whole wheat penne available. The mussels are not fresh and the tomato sauce has a spicy kick to it and my DC hates everything!! Poor me ended up stuck with the pasta!   Since Smash Kitchen is quite new, staffs really need more training. I really felt that services are lacking and just little details that made my dinner experience not as enjoyable.  - Water never refills until asked - Right cutlery not supplied until requested twice: how can I eat my chicken with a small fork??  - waitress not really sure about menu or make helpful suggestions - The restaurant is not even busy and I felt neglected...not a good feeling...   I am not sure if I coming back to Smash Kitchen again at least not for the food, since at this price point there are quite a few options... maybe for a drink on the patio..."}
{"text":"The LA mac n' cheese is simple but perfect. My boyfriend and I shared one and regretted not ordering a second one. We also tried their halibut special that night and their angry lobster linguini. The halibut was served with a mushroom risotto and greens, yum! The linguini was definitely spicy and had a good amount of lobster in it. Overall, we enjoyed our dinner. Thank you for satisfying our comfort food craving!"}
{"text":"Fave dishes from Smash Kitchen (i've already been back more than a few times...) Grilled Calamari Crab Cakes Seafood Paella Seafood Salad (just realizing my fishy flavoured pallet)  And to wash it all down, BRETT'S LP - hands down one of my favourite cocktails. Ever. (created by an amazing manager there)  Love this place. Take your date!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday morning around 10:15 with a group of 12 people. They do a prix fixe thing for brunch which is a really good deal - for $20 you a tea or coffee, choice of any breakfast item, and choice of any dessert! Such a steal, because you are basically getting the dessert for free :D  After spending a long time debating what to get, I decided on the chicken & waffles, and I was very pleased with my choice! I normally don't get the hype about chicken & waffles, but this one was very, very good. The chicken was very lightly breaded and cooked to perfection, not overcooked or too dry, it was crispy on the outside and then soft and moist on the inside. The waffle also tasted fresh and was not overcooked - other places sometimes have make them so they are hard/crunchy and impossible to saw through, or kind of rubbery and stale, but Smash's waffles were fluffy and soft, so they were easy to eat and enjoy with the chicken. The dish comes with vanilla butter and a spicy citrus maple syrup, which is very unique and delicious! It is really not that spicy, and the citrus flavour helps tone down the sweetness of the syrup. Goes really well with the chicken and waffle!  I sampled a few other things, and thought they were good, but not as good as my chicken and waffles. The crab cakes benedict is quite delicious, but like one reviewer pointed out below, it is seasoned quite heavily and it a bit too flavourful for my taste. A few small bites would be okay, but I don't think I would enjoy eating the whole dish myself. Also tried a bit of the smash benedict, which has pulled pork, gravy, and cheese. Again, this wasn't bad, but also didn't blow me away.  Service was pretty good considering we had a big group, and the interior of the restaurant is nice, casual, with high ceilings and a chill kind of vibe. Would recommend just for the chicken and waffles, because I really enjoyed them, and prices are pretty reasonable!"}
{"text":"I've literally come here for brunch, lunch, dinner, snack time, you name it. Smash kitchen is killing it with their awesome food and amazing service. I always get their corn tomato soup cause it is heaven in my mouth.  No matter when you come here, the menu provided will be versatile with the portions exceptionally big. A lot of my friends know about Smash because of their brunch menu, so I highly recommend everyone to head down there for brunch. If you like the vibe during brunch then you'll like it even more during dinner.   The staff here are fast and on their toes. I came here many times on special holidays when it was a full house and was never disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"If you live in Markham and you're a little sick of coras, eggsmart, and other big chain breakfasts you need to try smash. If you have a sweet tooth in the morning, try their French toast blocks... I forget the actual name, but trust me on this... They'll blow you away. Even if you don't have a sweet tooth, the other breakfast items are ridiculously good. Definitely one of the better breakfasts I've had locally"}
{"text":"The food was great well prepared. the price is above average for brunch we had a buger and meatloaf with 2 beers was 50 bucks.   But the decor inside is decent and I would come back to try other things.   The sign outside looks horrible but don't let it turn u away it well worth trying."}
{"text":"My friend took me here for brunch and it was certainly a popular spot for locals. We were seated near a corner which was nice since we wanted to catch up.   We ordered their $25 price fix menu and an entree to share.   The waffle + chicken was alright. The chicken had bones and not a lot of meat. The waffle was crispy and sweet. No need of syrup.   The veggie omelette was full of goodies. Smaller in size than other brunch places that I've been to in Mississauga. We sub the toast with French toast which was too sweet for me as it was coated with sugar. The best part was their potatoes which was stir fried with veggies. A very nice touch. Never had it that way before!!!   My friend appreciated that she left the coffee thermos with us so we didn't have to get the waitress. Service was great.   The sorbet/ice cream scoops was divine!! Loved every bite. I do hope they made it in-house.   Verdict: Will definitely go back again... with my partner!"}
{"text":"Smash Kitchen is a really popular brunch spot, but when we came here it was for a dinner to celebrate a birthday. Their staff was very accommodating for group bookings. They have a spacious room for big groups that have a curtain, so it's easier to talk from across the table. There's also no cake fee which is great (even for icecream cakes). Their service is really great, with the waitress coming to check up on us once in a while in the room. It was a bit spotty when we were trying to pay, but that wasn't a big problem since at least we were fed and satisfied. It was easy for everyone to split the bill (I think they asked us when we did the phone booking and again when we arrived).  Their food is decently priced. Most of us ordered their burgers which were delicious and MASSIVE. They also come with a huge portion of fries in case you think you won't be full. They have a lot of weekday specials like $1 corkage which is super rare, and would be great for a nice night out on a budget. Definitely will go again!"}
{"text":"My cousins brought me here for my bachelorette dinner.  Was so pleased with our service and food.  The Truffle Oil Mac & Cheese and their Big Meatball were our favs.  Among the group there were some food allergies and the staff was so accommodating in regards to checking ingredients and ensuring no cross-contamination.  Staff was so polite and attentive.  Thanks for helping to make this a memorable night!"}
{"text":"I was looking to have a light dinner with a bit of dessert while I was on the road for work and I decided to do take out.   I got the Beet Caprese without the cheese (I know I'm crazy, I just am not a fan of that cheese but I love beets). The sauce on the beets and tomatoes was out of this world! I loved the pesto on the combo. I think it would have been good with a little crunch factor of some kind. Then I decided to go Gluten Free and get the sinful chocolate bar--to die for. (I guess not the light meal I was thinking of).   The staff was very friendly when I came to pick up my order. They directed me to the bar and the bartender assisted immediately (typically I feel like bartenders are annoyed when distracted from what they actually do). Lovely friendly Canadians!  Also, be careful when you do carry out for the beets because the containers don't totally close and mine leaked."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch or dinner spot in Markham for good food at good prices. The servers have always been excellent and the food has always been spot on. The donuts are delicious as a dessert as is the MONSTER BURGER. Please, please, please make reservations!! Even for two people on a Weds night, it was packed but because we had to wait 45min for a table on previous attempts, an online reservation was perfect!"}
{"text":"My first experience at Smash was earlier last year... came with a few girlfriends for dinner. We notified our waitress of a tree-nut allergy prior to ordering.  Food arrives, things were going well, food was delicious--- but then the friend with the allergy starts feeling funny.  We clarify with the waitress to ensure the meal was tree nut free, which she wasn't sure until she asked the chef in which he mentioned the pesto they use is cashew based!  As soon as we knew we immediately asked her to get the bill & machine so that we can get her to the hospital.  While we wait for the waitress to get the bill, the chef/manager/someone important told us not to worry about the bill, and that they have it taken care of. Although really unexpected, we were quite relieved because her symptoms were getting worse.  Needless to say, it was scary... but the situation was handled well & left a good impression on their service. I've brought friends (without food allergies) and have not had any issues, the food & drinks are absolutely delicious. The caesars are my absolute favourite.  All in all, the food is on point, service is great--- but perhaps more attention can be brought to the menu regarding nut allergies and how staff can communicate that to the customers to ensure a comfortable experience!"}
{"text":"I was thrilled to find a place in the North End that serves grilled calamari. It's decent here. The fried chicken is a must try, but I have also tried the Mac and cheese, seafood paella and ribs. All really good. Probably my favourite place to eat in Markham."}
{"text":"This was my second time eating here.  I had the chicken and waffles the first time I was here (Sunday late lunch/brunch menu). I was iffy about the syrup but it worked well with the chicken. The dish was excellent overall. Our waitress was average though. She wasn't pleasant (nor rude). She gave my friend the wrong kind of tea, and when she got the correct one, she left the old one on the table. There were four of us at a square table and there was literally no room. That was the only bad thing about the place - our waitress was below average.  I came back with my husband last Sunday for a late lunch (brunch menu), and this time our waiter was very polite, chirpy, and helpful. I ordered the crab cakes benedict, and my husband ordered the eggs florentine (which had smoked salmon). We thought the dishes were amazing. I liked my crab cakes benedict way better than the chicken and waffle! Chicken and waffle was still excellent but the crab cakes benedict was delicious. I also ordered an extra side of peameal bacon because I like my protein. Prices overall are great. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Love the food and love the restaurant's owner. But never once that the waiter does their job correctly and took the order right. Everytime I order in this restaurant something is wrong win the food delivered. If they can't keep up their service level this restaurant will not keep its review up. In today's meal it took 3 times trial and error until I get my dish"}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants in Markham! Came here a few times, and each time that I've been here, the food and service were amazing.   Whenever I come here, this restaurant is almost always full! Even though it is, I never had a problem of getting a table upon arrival. It's a popular spot. The waiters are very kind and attentive. They do check up on you and make sure everything is okay. Also, the manager walks around to make sure you are doing well.  The food here is amazing! My personal favourites are the truffle mac and cheese and the smash lovers pizza (I haven't tried a lot of items on the menu though). I often get the mac and cheese, and I ask them for chilli flakes (believe me, it tastes amazing). The smash lovers pizza is good, however it isn't thick. So if you like pizza slices that are thick, then you might not be a huge fan of this pizza. The mac and cheese is the way to go. It's that good, believe me.  This is the perfect spot to catch up with friends, celebrate a special event, etc. I will definitely be one of their regular customers!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time here at Smash Kitchen and Bar. We had great service. I had the berry mojito and it was very good. For lunch I had the LA Mac and Cheese and it was amazing. I would totally go back to try the other Mac and Cheese. Overall I found it to be affordable and the quality of the food was great."}
{"text":"I honestly love coming here so much that I've been raving to my friend about this restaurant for months. We were finally able to coordinate a time to go together at last. As I wanted to ensure we'd have a table, I made reservations ahead of time to guarantee just that.   Little did I know this would be the beginning of a not-so-pleasant experience....   When we were first seated, the host put us in a small room off to the side of the restaurant.... I thought this was peculiar as I saw many other tables for two people in the main part of the restaurant but said nothing as I assumed for whatever reason, this table was ours BECAUSE I made a reservation.   This room is very secluded from the rest of the restaurant so despite needing to provide feedback on the food, I wasn't able to as our waitress was nearly impossible to flag down. This was through no fault of hers but more so due to where we were seated.   Moving onto the food. I've ordered the Chickpea Burger the last four or five times I've come here and never have I been so disappointed. When our waitress first set down my food, I noticed that parts of my chickpea patty had already come apart before I even touched it. It was essentially in pieces before it was set down on the table? As I waited for my waitress to return so I could provide feedback, it had already been 10-15 minutes due to the nature of where we were seated. I was too hungry to wait at this point so I bit into it. I'm not sure if the kitchen was just off today or something but there was an extremely overpowering lemon flavor to it for some reason...... In addition to that, the chickpea patty flattened almost immediately after my first bite and broke apart even more than it originally had. I also noticed that the bite I took had no goat cheese on it because the other half of the burger had an inch thick layer of goat cheese there instead of it being evenly distributed in the burger.   I'm still giving this place three stars because my side of sweet potato fries were still delicious as per usual but this visit was definitely the most disappointing one out of all the times I've been here."}
{"text":"Smash kitchen did catering for our Collage networking event and it was absolutely phenomenal. The food was seasoned very nicely, the platters were arranged in an appealing fashion, and staff were very cooperative. Would have preferred a more affordable price, but for the quality of food, it was definitely worth it compared to other companies.   We ordered curry chicken skewers, little cold cut burgers, spring rolls, crab cakes, and bruschetta. The crab cakes were my favourite!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this place after seeing 400+ reviews and it was good! I had the burger and it was tasty. Classic American-style griddle smashed double burger. The other members of my party tried the pasta, the wrap, and the steak salad. They all said the food was really good but the steak was not cooked correctly. Medium vs. Rare, what we received. Besides that the restaurant was really good and I really liked the ambiance and friendly service."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Stumbled upon smash kitchen because my friend and I couldn't get into another Restuarant we wanted to go go...but I am uber happy to have found this gem. I had their eggs Bennedict on crab cakes and ate every last bite. The crab cakes had so much favour to it, I find alot of places have a hard time seasoning them to perfect but Smash found their magic.   Spacious environment great for a brunch. I prefer their brunch menu over dinner on regards to options and taste."}
{"text":"Disappointed, came for brunch, should have come for lunch or dinner.  Chicken and waffles $17 - gross, waffles were soggy, tenders didn't taste fresh, and were very hard, and lacked flavour. At $17 I was expecting some serious quality, considering it's more expensive than a lot of the other places in the city that offer it.  Steak and Eggs $18 - worse than the chicken and waffles. Wife asked for the steak medium well, came out medium rare, she couldn't eat it. I tried it out since I don't mind med-rare, quality of the steak was good, however, was lacking flavour. Had to add salt on top. Wife asked for a side of toast to eat her eggs, no mention of a charge, but $3.50 added to the bill. Not too happy with that.   Was going to complain to the manager but we were in a rush and had to go. Wish I came here for lunch or dinner since I heard good stuff about the place, but now due to my terrible brunch experience, don't think I'll be coming back here.  Hope your experience is better than mine!"}
{"text":"My second visit was a much better experience than the first one. Service was friendly and attentive unlike the first visit we had. I would give it 3.5 stars.  This place has specials Mon to Thu. 1) Monday: $10 pizza, any pizza on the menu. This is a steal. They have coal fired oven; pizzas are quite delish. Four of us ordered 5 pizzas to try as we couldn't decide what to get.  My order of preference, from the best to not so best:  Chorizo, Neptune, Nova Scotia, Smash, and Bacon & Eggs. Chorizo was the best one, I would get this again and again. I didn't expect to like the Neptune (shrimps and smoked salmon seem odd on pizza) but it was surprisingly delish.   2) Tuesday: $10 burger with a side (salad, fries, or soup). Burger patties were juicy; fried onion chips were a nice touch to the burger.   3) Wednesday: AYCE ribs for $27. I have yet to tried so I can't comment on this but I heard they have good ribs and chicken.   4) Thursday: half off wine.  Other items we have tried:  - Ahi Tuna Wontons: 3 for $14. Nice apps, I would say its worth the money. Wonton shells are nice and crispy. - Duck tacos ($5 each) were flavourful, satisfied.  One of my friend bad the buttermilk fried chicken. He enjoyed it.  Overall, it was a nice place for us to hang out with friends, grab a bite and have some drinks. I do enjoy the food here. Service seems to be hit and miss though. First visit was quite bad customer service and second visit was a better experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Different Specials everyday! We went for the Monday $10 pizza plus a couple of side dishes and were very very happy. Had a chance to meet and chat with returning  Executive Chef Mark who creates superb dishes! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is delicious and reasonably priced. The truffle mac and cheese is so good and a must try. Service is super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Found this gem on Yelp, and this discovery alone has made this app its weight in gold.  Not that an app has any weight, but I mean this in the best possible way.  Loved this place.  The service (Nick), and food were equally amazing.  We had the delicious, albeit messy ahi tuna wonton appetizer (comes with 3), Pride of Nova Scotia pizza which had a ton of real lobster.  We were sceptical about that ingredient before ordering, but we were so wrong.  Amazing, especially with their optional chilli oil.  The brisket grilled cheese was also amazing and piled high.  Kid's chicken fingers were huge and rated a 10 out of 5 possible stars from our son.  Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"16 of us came for brunch around 2pm after Good Friday service at our church nearby. We called ahead and arrived at the time that they told us the table would be ready, but we still had to wait for about 20 minutes before we were seated. There were a lot of us though, so we didn't really mind.  This place is definitely great for brunch! The menu has good variety, but isn't overwhelmingly long. My crab cake benedict was great! The eggs were poached perfectly, the crab cakes were tasty and not greasy, and I enjoyed the sm'hash browns (i.e. home fries) that came on the side. My only complaint is that I wish there was a little more hollandaise sauce and pico de gallo. Portion sizes are definitely quite generous as I was stuffed afterwards! Good thing I decided not to opt in for the prix fixe option ($20 includes entree, dessert and coffee/tea) -- although a great deal, I wouldn't have been able to finish everything without falling into a deep food coma afterwards. I did sample my friend's chocolate mousse, which was just okay...that was the only thing that didn't totally impress me.  Atmosphere here is lovely -- classy, yet unpretentious and casual. Props to our servers for taking such good care of all of us! I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Lunch at Smash was simply smashing lol.  Once you get over the confusing signages outside that has both Smash and an animal hospital on top of one another, you'd be glad that it's not an animal hospital once you enter the establishment.  On the contrary, this restaurant screams classy elegance! And i love the wide variety of choices available on the menu.  In the end after salivating over every entree listed, i settled on warm steak salad.  It consists of 4oz sirloin, kale, spinach, fingerling potatoes, mushrooms, Italian bacon & caramelized onion ragout, blue cheese, spicy pecans, scallions, radishes, grape tomatoes, ranch dressing.  All for $18 for a large plate.  Usually people think salads are light weight meals, but not this one.  The sheer quantity as well as the slices of steak, and the sauce are quite filling.  I always hesitate when it comes to ordering salad because i hate having to finish a meal and still fill unfull.  But this salad was perfect for me.  The only reason why i am rating this review a 4 star is because they left the sauce under the steak, which i thought would have tasted so good on top of the steak instead.  Can't wait to go back to savour their other dishes!!!!"}
{"text":"Burger Binge Week review: The Smash Burger  Tucked in a lone corner of a usually empty plaza at just west of Main Street Unionville and Highway 7 is a classy joint where they make comfort food for classy people.  The Smash Burger is basically their Monster Burger without the fix-ins from what I can tell.  You still get the big and juicy patty and their unique Smash Sauce.  When it comes to you, it would look very daunting with its thickness even if it wasn't the monster it is still larger than the average mouth.  Per instructions from the owner, the reason it is called a Smash Burger is because you have to \"Smash\" it down before you eat it.  You also need to keep the ridiculously long toothpick in place otherwise the thing will come out messy per the server's instructions.  So presentation is a bit on the rough (but fun) side.  The burger itself is a good enough meal for one person who does not want to blow up their figure without the sides.  The meat is juicy and tasty, though it isn't too fragrant when we ate it.  I am guessing it isn't charbroiled, but the sauce makes up for it as well.  At their regular price it is quite pricey along with everything else, but the venue is pretty classy too and the owner does great PR along with great service every time I come here.  It's one of those places where I save up some money to enjoy some excellent food for once in a while for date night with the Mrs."}
{"text":"After coming here for a solid 3 years, my last two experiences were so far out to left field (in regards to food & experience) that I can't leave a review on here any higher than a 2, I am really fair with my reviews and I don't want there to be a hype when really, there shouldn't be. This place use to be sooooooooooo good, but I don't know what happened?   I had gift certificates that were given to me due to my horrible experience in December of 2016, so, for a celebratory dinner evening out with another couple, we decided to come here and spend the whole certificate on dinner + then some. We figured maybe the last experience was due  to just a busy night or something.   Off the bat, this night was better. We were seated right away (unlike last time where I waited almost 40'mins with a reso). We ordered apps, which came out quick. They were good. Warm and fresh.   For dinner I ordered a 10 oz steak. The most expensive thing on their menu for dinner. It came out ice cold. Not cold, ice cold. Other party ordered the chicken and ribs. Also cold. (Same experience as my last visit where my meatloaf was ice cold). They took it back, threw it back on the grill and brought it back. How can a kitchen send out a steak ice cold? Honestly? The women got pasta and salad, why take the steak off the grill and let it get cold? This is basic kitchen procedure. Manager came by, offered us onion strings (this place loves giving you onion strings when they mess up, I got them last time too!). $33 plate (which isn't expensive, but is the most expensive on the menu) I expect a nice, hot steak. Not onion strings!!!  Going onto dessert, we got deconstructed carrot cake. Had carrot purée, NO CREAM CHEESE?!, the smallest scoop of icecream I've ever seen in my life and left a taste in our mouthes comparable to a dry carrot muffin. This can be had for $7.   With our certificates we still spent $60 with no alcohol.  Definitely not worth the money, before it was.. but I can't justify spending that much here anymore.. not that it's expensive, it's just not WORTH it IMHO.   2/5."}
{"text":"Great food, had the nova Scotian pride pizza, absolutely delicious! Lobster, roasted garlic tomatoes plus a few others. A must try for all the seafood lovers out there!"}
{"text":"Smash makes some seriously good pizza, comparable to some favoured pizza spots in downtown Toronto. I've been there twice, once for dinner and the 2nd time for brunch. I would highly recommend getting the pizza and the ribs.  As for brunch, I ordered the Smash eggs benedict. It was pretty good. I like the atmosphere too, definitely a hidden gem in the Markham area.   The only complaint I have is that servers are kinda inexperienced. When encountered with a billing issue, he first told us it's because they have raised the prices across multiple menu items. There's nothing he can do to rectify it. We were obviously not happy with that answer, because if that's the case, he should have at least informed us at the beginning when we were ordering.   He later came back with the prices fixed, saying that he has pressed the wrong button for the classic breakfast. That's cool but it didn't sit well with me. Automatically I was thinking, hmm.. .was he lying  when he first said all the prices have been raised? Certainly doesn't seem all that honest to me.   I would still go back though, given the food IS excellent. It's probably a one-off occurrence, just giving some constructive feedback so the restaurant can be all-around amazing! :)"}
{"text":"Friday night out.  Apps we had were grilled calamari,  Deep fried Shrimps , tuna wantons and crab cakes.  Main entrees were lobster mac n cheese, seafood soup and surf n turf burger.  Food was yummy.  Would come back."}
{"text":"I got to come here at last after seeing it pop up on my feed from time to time. The restaurant is at the corner of a plaza, and you can see a big sign for it if you look up. Got inside, and the waitresses and hostess were quite friendly, probably cause the place wasn't that busy tonight.  My friend and I ordered the ahi tuna wontons, and the smash burgers. The Tuesday daily special is $10 smash burgers, and the 10% off check in also applies to specials in case you were wondering like I was.  Just a note for future reference: the smash burger also has pickles in it. (Cause it doesn't say in their description on the menu.)  The wontons were pretty tasteful, it had some sauces mixed in with the tuna on top of some greens, and mayo on top. It was three on a plate, and for $14 I don't think it's that worth it, but at least to try it once since I've been wanting to come here. It was also listed as a chef's favourite, so that helped my decision in ordering.  The smash burger was good, and I chose to get fries as my side. The other side options didn't sound appealing to me. They put two patties in it with lettuce, onion rings, pickles, and cheese. It was juicy and delicious, satisfied my burger craving but I don't think the meal is that filling if you're looking to eat a lot.  I might come back here, but it closes pretty early imo so that's one of the reasons I haven't had a good opportunity until now."}
{"text":"I ordered the eggs florentine for my love of smoked salmon. The eggs were poached perfectly, and I liked how they weren't drowning in hollandaise sauce, which is the problem I usually have with eggs benny. The spinach and capers also paired really well with the salmon. Eaten alone, the hash browns got a bit too salty after a while, so I'd recommend having it with ketchup. Overall, a very well thought-out dish!"}
{"text":"Great food, great options and and great service. If you are looking for a nice place to meet a few friends or take family members, try this place out. Pretty reasonably priced. The only thing is that is only serves a brunch menu which may not cater to all individuals as some people around 12:00-1:00 p.m would prefer a lunch menu. Other than that, smash was a smash :-) (corny I know!)."}
{"text":"I came back here last weekend for brunch with my best friends and our moms. It was great once again!   It was our server's first shift and she did an amazing job. She was very friendly and helpful.  I got the bacon and mushroom omelette (just realized there were 3 t's in omelette LOL) with no cheese (obvs) which came with fruit, toast and home fries. It didn't look huge but definitely filled me up!  It tasted a little buttery or milky or thick or whatever it was for my liking (heyyyy lactose!) but good nonetheless.  All the moms got the veggie omelette (dammit spelt it wrong again), it was quite adorable, and they all really loved it.  My friends got bennys, one of them got the crab cake one which I got last time and I recommended it to her. She loved it!  Overall it was a great time and I was happy to return. My friends tried to choose somewhere that had a 2.5 star rating at shops on don mills and I was like NUH-UHH! Let the Yelp queen be in charge of the restaurant selection ladies! They definitely were not disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding service. Was there on a Tuesday . The food was great.  I'll drop by again. Nice and place to hang and watch the game."}
{"text":"I have come back to Smash on numerous occasions for their Brunch menu.  This place is popular and busy, but the staff are super friendly and get you seated quickly.    They have a good selection of brunch items...Eggs Benedict, crab Cakes Benedict, Belgian Waffles, Chicken and Waffles, Meatloaf Skillet.  All of the items I have tried are very good.  Solid establishment."}
{"text":"Their food here is excellent. I have been here for lunch and dinner but decided to try brunch finally. I was pleased! Hubby and I are eggs benny kind of people so we had the florentine and crab cake benedicts. Both were delicious and came with more than enough home fries. We ordered a slice of cheesecake to finish off the meal. And while I don't believe it is made in-house, it wasn't a bad little cheesecake. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Tried the lunch here and thought the service was incredibly, but the food did not wow me. Tried the burger, sandwich and soup, and pizza. The pizza was quite tasty, and the portions of the sandwich and burger were very big for the price. Seating was very comfortable and I liked the ambience, but the flavours were quite average and reminded me of a Moxies or Milestones. For the price, it is not bad though. It is worth trying."}
{"text":"My friend found this place. This was my first time, tucked away in a seemingly dull strip plaza. The ambience in the restaurant was extremely nice, and the staff working were all friendly and attentive. The food is similar to your standard western favourites with a bit of special twists; like Mac and cheese with truffles, Asian fusion tuna tartare on wonton wrappers :) interesting cocktail menu. This would be a great place for friends to each and social and a good place to bring a date. The food was amazing, their ribs are super amazing and that mac and cheese; it was heavenly.  Would love to go there again very soon :) prices are pretty great for the amount of food you get."}
