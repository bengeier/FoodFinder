{"text":"Certainly something for everyone here! I had the burger and fries and my husband had the Bolognese. Both were delicious. The owner made us a desert by using liquid nitrogen to freeze a cocktail.... It was like a yummy sorbet but smoother. Husband also had an old fashioned that was one of the best we've had. So happy to have this place local. For the quality it is very affordable!"}
{"text":"Went for a Valentine's Day dinner with my wife and friends.  We had a great evening while enjoying great food, wine and cocktails.   I had the Transitional steak, my wife had the pasta bolognese, our friends had a monk fish small plate, 96 hour short rib small plate, and the tenderloin steak.  Let me tell you,  we all just said mmmmm after our first taste!  Everything was absolutely delicious!  For desert we shared a brownie dish and the table side sorbet with alcohol!   Both were fantastic!   Chef Matt stopped by our table and was friendly and thanked us for coming in.  Do not pass up an opportunity to come to this restaurant!   You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Absolutely out of this world. Chef Matt is a master of his craft. Not only is the food amazing, but the atmosphere and experience just make this a fantastic experience. If I could only recommend one restaurant, this would be my pick! 

The small plates are fantastic. Perfect portions, and there are plenty of interesting, fun options. Entrees are seriously unreal. Every one is obviously a very carefully put together meal.  Desserts are refreshing, delicious, and all incredibly fun in a lively, quirky way that really makes everything unique. 

Service was fantastic. There are no other words. I suspect the chef knows my taste buds better than I ever will, and the staff has precognitive abilities. 

First time there we tried the short rib, and were absolutely blown away, and things only went up from there. Steak was the best I've ever had, and the entire plate was so well put together. Harmonious, and honestly perfect. 

I'm always concerned when a dining experience is THIS good, that it is lightning in a bottle, but upon revisiting, and based on everyone I've recommended it to, it's always this good! Which is honestly incredible. 

If you want a resteraunt experience that is truly epitome of dining, yet also holds a special, unique flair, I cannot reccomend Mizestro enough."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming portions were unpredictable my friend and i both ordered from small plate section she got a peice of salmon that was maybe five bites, i got a bowl of lo ster mac and cheese, had to pick lobster out it was horrible and dry.   Creme brulee was ok but portion was small again for a price of what you would get a decent portion of other places.  Service was manageable nothing fantastic for as expensive and fancy as the place was trying to seem.  Would not recommend to others."}
{"text":"A wonderful experience from arrival to departure. I unexpectedly walked into this unique spot-an ambient, romantic atmosphere that meets down to earth with regulars watching the basketball game! The bartender/owner/chef greeted us immediately. Our waitress was friendly and full of recommendations. I had the Steak Loin plate-which was delicious. Matthew is creative, artistic and is truly a skilled chef. My medium rare steak was cooked to perfection and the plates were beautiful. This restaurant then topped my expectations with a margarita sorbet for dessert made at our table on the spot by Matthew himself. It was amazing! The staff is so kind. I would highly recommend supporting this local restaurant. I had a superb experience. Thank you Mizestro!"}
{"text":"What a cute and cozy restaurant right in the middle of Brecksville!  Had a glass of great wine and some incredible appetizers (wings and beautiful cheese plate).   The owners were present and interactive for a refreshing change from most restaurants.

Enjoyed meeting everyone and the customers are friendly; I may become a regular!!"}
{"text":"Another night that did not disappoint. The food is unbelievably delicious. From appetizers to salads to main dishes.. All are out of this world. The owners are great to talk to and Chef Matt is at every table. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking to go someplace special for our 25th wedding anniversary.  We eat out often so we planned to go to an upscale place in downtown Cleveland.  My wife was looking online for a new place to try, and she was surprised to see how high the ratings were for Mizestro in Brecksville.  This is in the same location as restaurant 21-82, but with the new owner it is a completely different experience.

We were floored at the entire experience.  From the drinks to the service to the meals, it was fine dining at its best.  For example, Chef Matt created several hand crafted drinks for us.  One was served in a small bottle that had the words \"drink me\" cleverly written on a tag to resemble the Alice and Wonderland experience; however, when you poured it into the martini glass over rocks the color changed as you poured.  Another drink was accompanied by apple pieces with cinnamon, syrup, salted caramel, cashew powder to pair with bourbon, vanilla and special bitters.  It was not on the menu.  Chef Matt just asked me a few questions about what flavors I liked then created it.  The meal was also exceptional, but rather than describe it I will post a few pictures.

The owner/chef came out to meet us and his background was impressive.  When we went home we googled him and found the following:

Award winning Chef Mize, a United States Marine Corps veteran, earned his degree from the Culinary Institute of America (CIA), Hyde Park, NY, while stationed at the Pentagon in Washington, DC.  He was the personal chef to the Commandant of the United States Marine Corps, Ret. General Charles Krulak.  After his honorary discharge from the Marine Corps, he was the Executive Chef for the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Smithsonian Institute, ARAMARK Corporation and prior to his leaving Philadelphia, the Multi-Unit Executive Chef for acclaimed restaurateur, Stephen Starr (Starr Restaurant Group) where he received the Chef of the Year award in 2011."}
{"text":"This restaurant is FANTASTIC.  The food, the staff and the presentation ate second to none.  Throw out your standards for the Cleveland food scene.  This is above it all.  Frozen Carmel popcorn balls!  Forget about it!!!"}
{"text":"Loved it! The waitress was very friendly & helpful. We had the Cheeseburger egg rolls for an appetizer, awesome.  I had Pasta Bolagnese which was delicious, huge serving. :) Hubby had the Transitional steak and enjoyed every bite. The desserts were sooo good and the little show that came along with our sorbet being made quite entertaining. We had fun and will definately be back. Chef took the time to come to our table. Chef Matt & team,  great job! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The lobster mac and cheese was awesome!  The creme brulee topped it off nicely.  The staff was very friendly.  I want to go back and try the surf and turf plate."}
{"text":"The 96 hour short ribs were killed and the chefs salad was one of the most innovative dishes I've had. Chef Matt is definitely one of rising stars to watch in the Cleveland food scene."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Brecksville! Chef Matt and his crew are cooking and creating fabulous cuisine. If you're looking for a great place to eat and drink give Mizestro's a try you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow! I made an account just so that I could express how amazing this place is. I was passing through on my way home and wanted to sit and eat good food with good wine. Boy did I get more than I expected! Smooth wines and absolutely chic and gourmet dishes, absolutely beautiful. And also affordable. I wish I lived near this restaurant I would be a regular. A must try. Small plates and entrees available. Each plate is a work of art."}
{"text":"Three food loving friends and I went up to give this place a try with the great reviews and pictures.  We were really looking forward to it. 

We ordered a plethora of appetizers and entrees and let the very nice server know we had 90 minutes before we had to leave. 45 minutes later we did not even have an appetizer. Then everything, appetizers and entrees, all came at once. 

The beet salad is beautifully plated and I would give it a decent grade. Not the best I have had but no complaints.  The butter poached lobster was kind of fishy and not that velvety texture you want from a butter poaching.  The sauces, in our opinion, did not pair well. The transitional steak was pretty decent entree with an excellent steak tartar with a perfect runny egg yolk, the filet was average and the short rib was slightly better than average but by no means exceptional. Now onto the scallops. Another friend and myself made the mistake of ordering these rubbery fishy scallops. Do not order them.  I have nothing good to say about them at all. If this review were based on the scallops it would be one star. Truly awful dish. Then, last came the cheese plate (we really could have used this while we waited 45 min) and it was probably my favorite of the savory dishes. 

The best part of the meal was the exceptional creme brûlée.  It was smooth and rich. One of the best I've had. 

The owner seemed very friendly. The waitress was friendly and we tipped well.  The food was mostly decent with the exception of one dish (did I mention the scallops were bad?).  I am giving this three stars instead of two because half the food was perfectly fine, the dessert was great and the people were very friendly. We didn't mind waiting for the food but please stagger a few apps out while we are waiting."}
{"text":"My husband surprised me with a birthday dinner at Mizetros and I absolutely loved it.  The service, food and ambiance were wonderful.  We will be back!  
Every bite was awesome, and I loved the sorbet!  So fun, what a great night!"}
{"text":"All of the food was awesome but can't give the full 5 stars because service was just not keeping up with everything else.

Let's start at the beginning.  This place is sooo cute!  What a quaint place, I loved walking in, the ambiance was very relaxed and laid back. Negative...nobody seemed to be able to direct us to a table, we weren't sure who to ask as everyone there was busy doing other things. 

But once seated, we enjoyed mulling over our menu items.  Drinks...really cool they rotate beer options daily. That was fun. My husband really enjoyed the microbrew options. Although they are limited on stock and my hubby cleared them out!  Haha. I wonder if you could make beer requests when making reservations?   Service negative...server sometimes was away for a while and she had a hard time answering questions. Just didn't seem to know much, maybe she was new?  She was very nice but could have been a little more up to speed on things.

Ordered cheesesteak egg rolls. These are a must!  They were absolutely delicious!   Followed by a nice cheese plate. And our Bibb salads were really yummy. I subbed goat cheese instead of blue cheese no problem. 

Dinner I had the sea bass. It was thinner/smaller than I've seen other places but I loved the flavoring and how they seared it so there was a tiny crispness to the coating. Delish!  One of our friends had the pasta. He didn't particularly like the sauce as it was very tomatoey but I took a taste and liked it that way. It was sweeter than other sauces

Lastly, we saw the next table over got the sherbet made table side. It was root beer float flavored. There was plenty extra so chef Matt came over to give is all a taste. It was amazing!!!  And chef Matt came out to all the tables with \"dragon breath\" popcorn. That was really fun and really good!

We were there about 2.5 hrs, not once did they try to move us out to get others in. This place is really a great experience and if you come be prepared to stay a while, relax and just enjoy your social time with the meal. With the chef out chatting with the tables, it made it feel like we were at a small party vs just out to a stuffy dinner"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to stop this evening to try out the restaurant.  The bar was busy they had a birthday celebration but we got a nice table.  Our server was Jeff.  He was very attentive.  We had a few cocktails then my husband ordered the chicken thigh it was wonderful.  The chicken was shredded with rice.  It had a little spice to it.  I ended up having quite a bit of his. I am ordering this the next time.  I had the beef strip loin it was also wonderful.  I ordered it medium well - cooked perfect!  Very tasteful with potato gratin and asparagus.  Gave my husband a small piece which he really liked.  I will definitely be going back again.  The owners made an effort to come out and talk to us and thank us for coming.  The interior is very nice and a welcoming color.  I was very impressed!"}
{"text":"Giving a one star rating is being generous, had reservations for 6 on a Friday, no one at the door to greet us so we stood there until a guy got up from the bar to get someone to seat us. They took our drink order eventually and we didn't see the drinks for about 15 minutes and asked twice, my friends ordered their entrees we ordered the campfire salad we had read about in Cleveland Magazine and our dinner, explained to our waitress that we had tickets for Severance Hall so there was a time constraint,my friends got their entree, we got zip, we waited and waited finally decided to cancel the salad just bring us our dinners, the salad showed up and about 10 minutes later the food,  Our friends were finished, the salmon my wife ordered was the size of a postage stamp, my Veal Piccatta came as a sausage that was inedible, couldn't cut it without a steak knife which we didn't have and I left it on the plat asked for bill which took about 3 tries and when we left we were late to arrive at Severance.  Wouldn't go back with a gun to my head"}
{"text":"What's there to say that's not already been said about this amazing place?? Truly spectacular and highly recommend. I've been here on a few occasions and am just getting around to rating now and it literally never disappoints. Phenomenal atmosphere, outstanding service and amazing food. Give it a try and you will not be disappointed. Five stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Loved the cocktails, small plates, and fabulous meal!

Chef Matt is amazing and the addition of his table side magic  adds a personal touch I have not experienced elsewhere.

Our server Jessica was great.  Pleasant, knowledgeable and very helpful.

We went with another couple and made a night of our visit.  We were so entertained we didn't want to leave.  This is a must try place for any occasion."}
{"text":"A dining adventure!  One of those meals where everyone tastes everything.  We tried to taste a little bit of everything. 96 hour short ribs were worth the trip alone. Melt in mouth.  The beet salad and the house salad where excellent.  Lots of little features in each dish to test your taste buds.   Jelled balsamic vinegar, lemon creme and aioli in various favors to compliment every dish. 

Scallops were a bit on the salty side but done to perfection.  The transitional  Beef was an experience.  We had never had beef tartare and we loved it.   The filet was incredible 
The chicken thigh adobo had this amazing rice and cream cheese that cooled done the chicken spices which definitely had some heat.  Delicious!

Dessert was some of the best  Creme Brûlée we have ever had and my husband is an expert.   The flourless chocolate cake was also a dining experience.   The cake was surrounded by strawberries, lemon creme and pecan ice cream so you could mix and match flavors.  Fun!!

We also had several martinis.    The pineapple is a winner!!

The menu is limited to  6 items but each item is a treat.   The plating is beautifully done.  We will go back.  It was a fun new dining experience."}
{"text":"If you are looking to spend a lot for little, this is the place for you. A friend and I went there a few weeks ago and except for three people at the bar, we were the only ones there. The food was gourmet with usual small portion and great presentation. The fountain drinks we're not good. The piece of bread we received was miniscule. Not our cup of tea. Don't know how they stay open."}
{"text":"5 stars does not do this amazing restaurant justice!
Came for an early dinner with my 2 friends.
Got there at 5 and they were all ready for us as I called ahead.

Interior: Charming, modern, beautifully appointed decorations yet comfortable.

Staff: Chef Matt (owner) is so down to earth and friendly.  He welcomes you and just wants you to be comfortable, have a good time and enjoy the food.  He actually dislikes the term \"fine dining\" cause he doesn't want to turn away anyone.  In fact, I had called to make reservations for 4 and a toddler and when I asked if toddlers were ok, he said of course! But then my one friend and toddler didn't make it and they totally missed out.

Food: creative, fresh, refreshing, vibrant, beautiful and full of flavor! The plating and presentation were all spot on! See pictures below.

Read the other reviews and had to try the 96 hour short ribs...so tender! We actually ordered another plate as it was delish!  
Crab cake and lobster bisque...yummy with a corn relish. 
 Steak tartare was beautifully presented with raw egg, capers, some other condiments and we mixed it up and ate with the crostinis! 
Beet salad with gouda ...so delightful with the balsamic vinaigrette and oils on the plate.
Seafood and tuba tartare was again gorgeous and so fresh.  The grapefruit and blood orange were so refreshing. 
The sausage and peppers Flatbread was so good we ate 2.

Manny, the server was excellent all around. Very personable and he recommended great wines. We went with a pinot noir and pinot grigio. 

Dessert...we had 3. Best vanilla bean creme brulee ever. He cooks it under water in mason jars so it doesn't dry out.  Just amazing.
Chocolate cake was well done.

Manny mentioned sorbet prepared tableside by the chef so we jumped on it.  Chef Matt Came Out With Some concoction and made Pomegranate Margarita sorbet. There was liquid nitrogen involved and cook freezing smoke.

To top it all off, he has a specialty he brought out at the end...dragon breath popcorn. I can't describe it...uou will have to try it all yourself!
Best hidden restaurant in cleveland!  I'm going to tell everyone about this spot.

Thank you for a winder full dining experience Chef Matt and Team!"}
{"text":"Came here again, actually several times since the last review. The server we had was just bad, I have to be honest about it. But, that is not a true reflection of chef Matt's restaurant, which is amazing!

I was with my 9 year old, she has heard my wife and I  talk about the sorbet so many times that she had to try it for herself. 

When it was time for dessert Chef Nathan came out, listened to the request only a nine year old would have (root beer sorbet) and went into the kitchen.  A few minutes later he was ready to make our sorbet. 

While whisking, he put on a show with the smoke from the liquid nitrogen and kept my daughter absolutely captivated. He engaged both of us in conversation through the whole process and absolutely made our visit something to always remember. He even let me videotape it to show my wife. 

So, if you are looking for a nice time with your significant other (or as I did this time) with your child, you can't go wrong with Mizestro. The food is impeccable and the show is always great and you always leave with cherished memories."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Chef Matt is a wizard and his staff are wonderful. You must experience this place."}
{"text":"Chef Matt and I would like to thank everyone for all of your support over the last 16 months at Mizestro.  We made the decision for both professional and personal reasons to sell the restaurant to an investment group out of Brecksville and we highly recommend you still visit and check out their new menu and meet all of them.  Thank you all from the bottom of our hearts for all your visits and reviews and we hope to introduce you to our next venture in the coming months.  Peace out!"}
{"text":"Okay, okay, calm down.  Every last one of these reviews, five stars?  Well, pardner.  Until I hop on the nag *not in this particular instance an euphemism* and strap on the feedbag, all those OTHER five stars?  Highly suspect.

Uh.  Mmmm.  Well?  Yeah.  FIVE stars.  This guy KNOWS how to cook.  I haven't had this kind of variety, this subtlety of flavor, this extensive palette in Ohio since... since... maybe ever?  I'll let the others describe in achingly detailed sub-atomic particulars the dishes.  We tried, let's see... eight?  Can't find a single fault with any of them.  Not. A. One.

Service?  Attentive if a bit amateurish.  Does that matter, in light of the food quality?  Naaah.  Is it one of those place into which you wander and are stunned by the atmosphere?  Naaah.  Does that matter?  Naaah.

I hope to keep going here until the word gets out and Chef Matt is spirited away to some \"destination restaurant\" or he decides to open up seven hundred Mizestro's and become another lost soul on the long, dusty road to chainhood.  I've only been gone from his place for three hours and am already scheming a way to return.  

\"When you are discontent, you always want more, more, more. Your desire can never be satisfied. But when you practice contentment, you can say to yourself, 'Oh yes - I already have everything that I really need.\"

{"text":"If you are not eating at this restaurant and live within 30min radius, you should get your head or palette checked. I wish I could give them ALL the stars, not just 5.

The food is easily worth twice what they are charging, and we've been back twice now in 2 weeks it's that good. We had to try the other items on the menu, and honestly not a single bad bite in 7 apps and 4 entrees. 

Their beet salad is maybe the most refreshing, crisp and fresh salad I have ever had, the 96 hour short ribs are a MUST, and kudos if you can eat just one.

I had the Sea Bass and Chicken thigh Adobo for my main dishes, the fish was cooked perfectly and devoured in minutes. The Chicken was enough food for 2 meals, which is a feet in and of itself, best part is it almost got better with age for the Adobo to really set up some nice flavor and heat.

It's easily the best food I've had in 2 years since going to Gordon Ramsey's STEAK in Vegas, and only because they have wagyu. Oh and that meal was 3* what we paid here for 2-3% better meal. 

Best part is first visit they ran out of the short ribs, and without question Chef Matt upheld his standards by not serving us ribs that were still in need of the low and slow cooking, but gave us the short ribs on the second visit on the house. As well as several adult beverages all on the account of being my birthday.

They have great mixologists, the drinks are very well thought out, and really kick the dinner up to the next level. Happy to be having lunch there soon, my mouth is already starting to water.

Go there, eat well, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The first several times I went to Mizestro I was wowed buy the food, the presentation and the friendly staff. Every morsel evokes happiness and Chef Matt and his staff make everyone feel comfortable as they serve creatively prepared, beautifully presented, delicious food. 

I decided to reserve the whole space as a venue for our high school reunion. Matt turned his place into a welcoming party venue with amazing food, specialty drinks made for our event, and food that was presented  throughout the evening. As the organizer, I didn't have a care in the world... I left menu selection in the hands of Chef Matt. Service was flawless. Our class of 85 stayed into the wee hours of the night at this welcoming venue. 
Thank you Matt, Jacquie and team for a fantastic evening and for allowing my high school friends to take over Mizestro for the evening. I'll be back soon..."}
{"text":"This place has changed owners again. It seems like the reviews and the hype are so dependent on the owners and chefs but the place keeps changing, so we never know what to expect. The place is very nice, but there's always a slight fishy odor. Interestingly, they had a menu with some great options but didn't have any of the seabass or salmon. The bread before the meal is cold and dry. I only mention it because who eats cold bread? Never could accept that from restaurants.  We really want to like this place because there are few \"high end\" restaurants in the area, and we're local, but it's not going to happen. A couple of entrees with tip will cost you about 85$, which is really hard to justify for the experience. My suggestion is that if you're going to keep the bar and TV, lower the prices. We've gone five times, and it's always an older crowd, 50+ and I'm always hearing their conversation from the bar. Call me a traditionalist but if you're going to do white table cloths and 26$+ plates, you need to create a more intimate environment suitable for conversations, which you're not achieving with the bar running through the place. I hope you have found this helpful."}
{"text":"Was in the area on business and found this place on Yelp.  With all the great reviews had to check it out.

It was a great dining experience all around.   Sat at the bar and service was excellent.   Relaxed atmosphere, down to earth crowd, great drink selection and the food was outstanding.

Had the chicken with Mole Sauce and 96 hour short ribs.   Chicken could have been a tad mouister but once dipped in the mole was incredible.  Matt says he uses 28 different ingredients in the mole.   Full of flavor with a spicy kick but not overpowering.   Short ribs were melt in your mouth tender and full of flavor.   
Matt and the staff were great and made me feel like I was a regular.   Definetly will return when I am in the area."}
{"text":"We ordered the 95 hour short rib and the steak egg rolls. They were a great preamble to a wonderful beet salad and to the chicken adobo and the beef sirloin. The deserts and drinks were delicious too. 
Great date night!"}
{"text":"This place is not what i expected. We walked in and no one helped us. It was awkward!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I have been twice now and it has be awesome both times! Chef Matt says he does fun dining! He is right he is so enjoyable and his food is to die for! The 96hr short ribs r best i have ever had! The dessert are so good. The cocktails are imaginative and fun! Go u wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food was fine but also nothing special. I may be spoiled cause we normally buy wild caught salmon to eat at home ourselves so the salmon starter seems like it was farmed and not that rich in flavor. It was cooked ok though certainly not very large. The chicken dishes we got could have been summarized into chicken with tomato sauce (adobe) and baked breaded chicken (Milanese). They lacked complexity in flavors. The sea bass was probably the best one given one crispy side and a generally well prepared piece of fish but I have had buttery-er sea basses in other places.

It was a cute place but the tables were incredibly close to one another and in this small restaurant, it was really really loud. I had to yell to be heard across my 4 person table and even at that, it was hard to hear each other. The clientele was mostly empty nesters, definitely not a young trendy crowd. Of course, it's not like there's a ton of other stuff around on a Saturday night so that's understandable.

On the plus side, wine list was very affordable and the Bibb salad was quite fresh and good. It was deconstructed. I probably would have liked more candid walnuts and cucumbers relative to lettuce but I won't complain. I always want more of a good thing. The service was also friendly though the tight tables made it hard for both water filler and waitress to check on us and the 2 tables adjacent to us. The small plates came out fast but the entrees had a long lag. I couldn't tell if the lag was the kitchen or the servers. I tend to think servers were overwhelmed with a bunch of tables coming in at the same time. Oh well. It happens.

Overall, this place is ok. It's obviously not trying to be fine dining which is fine but it's really hard to enjoy a dinner where I can't hear the person across from me and the quality of the food didn't over compensate for the poor ambiance."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Mizestro a few months ago, I was singing it's praises. The Transitional Beef dish was amazing, I was telling everyone about it and that they should go there. And everything I've had there has been delicious! I loved it. I would have given it 5 stars. It was a great experience.

My visit on Dec 5th, completely changed my view and it was upsetting because I wanted to show the place off to my friends. I loved it and wanted my friends to love it too. Perhaps this was just a fluke? Or a bad day? But my experience on my second visit was atrocious. The server might have been new? But she was about as opposite from attentive as you could get. We were sat at our table and it took about 10-15 minutes before we even got menus and then another 20 before we got water and my boyfriend never even got a water. Our other friend ordered a drink and it was about 40 minutes before we got that. And the waitress would leave so quickly after giving us something that we couldn't even ask for anything else.

\"Thank you and...wait- can I order a-?\" And she's gone. 

By the time we were actually able to order food it became clear that I wasn't going to be eating much of anything, as I actually had something I needed to get to in an hour and a half. Which we told the waitress repeatedly, but it didn't seem like she was really paying attention or understood what we were saying. I thought an hour and half would be plenty for me to at least order something small which I would eat, and then leave my friends to their bigger meals. But I wound up leaving without ever eating anything and only getting one glass of water. I learned later that it took 2 hours after I'd already left for one of my friends to even get her food. 

I really hope this was just a random bad day. Because the food here was really good and I liked the atmosphere the first time."}
{"text":"Took a road trip from Philadelphia to the Ohio area, I couldn't believe how amazing the food was not to mention how friendly and caring the staff was. If I ever come back to Ohio this will definitely be my first stop!"}
{"text":"First timers at mizestro restaurant. Great new owners.. awesome food.. can't wait to come back.. i only rated this four stars as it is not an intimidating restaurant.. upscale great dishes"}
{"text":"Wonderful new, Fun place. Husband and wife team of Cleveland transplants give you a warm, inviting experience. Matt's culinary imagination is mind blowing. I've tried foods I would never have eaten, and have loved every beautiful morsel. Always someone interesting and friendly to sit next to at the bar, while you ooh and ahh over each other's entrees. A great place I return too often."}
{"text":"Chef Matt is amazing.  One of the best meals I have ever had In a chef owned restaurant.   We were in Akron  on business with foodie friends so we searched Yelp and based solely on photos and reviews visited chef Matt.   We went Tapas style and dish after dish was amazing.  Matt has a cool back story...be sure to ask and be sure to try the dragons breath popcorn.  Fun!!!  Who would think you'd find a place this good and cool outside a major city!!!!  Enjoy."}
{"text":"We went here after reading reviews in Cleveland Crain's and Scene about how this place was Fun Dinning. Like this excerpt from cleveland.com:

 \"smoking cocktails, tableside preps of frozen sorbets using liquid nitrogen, some 'amuse bouche' one-bites. And maybe some molecular gastronomy,\" Mize adds.\"

Our dinning experience was nothing like this.  
Nothing on this menu was new or innovative.  No Molecular Gastronomy.  

The food was just OK for this price range and the service was below average.  We had high hopes coming in expecting a gastronomic adventure but were let down considerably.  for $30 per plate there a lot better restaurants in Northeast OH serving this type of food."}
{"text":"Clearly a lot of people really like this place, and it's definitely an outlier in the suburb of Brecksville, that's for certain. I came here on a weeknight with a few friends, after months of being eager to try this place. I could sum up my experience with two words, still hungry. 
I get the idea of fine dining, and I do savor the flavors of smaller portioned dishes, but the portions here are REALLY small, like really small. My friend ordered the duck breast, and I think she got about 5 bites on her plate, no substantial sides to speak of. I ended up getting the short rib, which was absolutely delicious, while my other friend got the transitional steak dish. We all enjoyed our dishes, but were still pretty hungry. We ended up getting two desserts, a chocolate stout dessert and the creme brulee. Unfortunately the server didn't describe the desserts very well, she told us the names, but failed to mention that the chocolate stout dessert is mostly foam. Again, still hungry. 

My other issue with this restaurant is the service. I think they had about two servers working the whole dining room, which would be fine given the size of the dining room for a casual restaurant, but for this type of restaurant you really expect top notch service to be included as part of the cost of your meal. Our server was an absolute sweetheart, but clearly occupied with several parties, and came around once only every 20 minutes or so. 

I also had an issue with the details of the design. Something about the space just feels off. It's nice inside, but at the same time it feels like a lot of the decor doesn't quite match the ambiance they are going for. I think they were going for a modern feel, but again there's just something a little mismatchy about it. Some may feel I'm being nitpicky, but I guess there are other places I'd rather spend my money where I enjoy the ambiance a little more. 

Did I enjoy my meal here? Yes, but I left hungry after spending nearly $100 for 3 people. I actually really enjoy going out to nice dinners, but there is a certain level of service and ambiance that comes with that price tag, and I feel like they haven't got it quite right here. I may return after some time has passed, but I'm not eager to return unfortunately."}
