{"text":"I've been looking forward to eating here for a few months. I come here occasionally on business, and happened to stay at the motel next door. When I discovered id be there again I was excited, but today I arrived late .. About 20 minutes before closing.. This is usually not a good time to stop I to a restaurant, especially on a Sunday evening . How ever I was pleasantly surprised when everything went as it should be. I had the chicken linguini , which was delicious. This is also a wine bar, but not being a wine drinker, and not much of a drinker whole I'm working, I can't really comment on this. It's location seems like a good one, right next to country club/ main st stop on the light rail.. I think I'm going to work hard to land this account, just so I can come here once a month or so..."}
{"text":"I have been dining at Il Vinaio for the last year or so and have nothing but great things to say. First off, the service is absolutely terrific! From start to finish, this restaurant has your best interests in mind with their great wine and food reccomendations. I feel confident ordering anything off their menu. I know finding great restaurants in Mesa, AZ is tough but Il Vinaio makes it easy! Go here!"}
{"text":"Didn't get a chance to try it because they closed before posted hours,  but still had their sign light."}
{"text":"I feel like a spoiled princess everytime I go here! Dear Lord the food and drinks are out of this world,  and the customer service is outstanding. The $8 bottle of champagne is such a great deal! Their hamburgers are by far the best! So great that no ketchup, mayo, mustard necessary. Im so glad I took a chance and decided to try a new wine bar. A wine bar with so many other options on the menu than most I have ever been too. I highly recommend this restaurant. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Wife & I celebrated our anniversary here. We were treated like a king & queen. Cindy is the best. She is an owner who is very friendly, sociable & her recommendations were perfect. Wife especially loved the gluten free bread & brownie desert. We are kinda ashamed it took us this long to visit. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing for Breakfast and Dinner!  The Lobster Eggs Benedict and Crepes are wonderful!  Their Steak and Antelope are delicious!  Service is always great!  This is a little downtown Mesa gem!!"}
{"text":"The Arizona Republic reviewer gave this restaurant rave reviews and commented that if dinner were that good, she was sure lunch would be too.  WRONG!  Six of us went to lunch and no one was happy.  Burgers that were ordered medium rare came as two very thin patties cooked well done.  The reuben meat was fatty and there wasn't much of it.  Other friends who had coincidentally gone in (whether it was for lunch or dinner) were also disappointed.  Don't waste your money here.  Go to The Grill on Main (a few blocks to the east) instead."}
{"text":"Il Vinaio is by no means an Italian restaurant, nor does it claim to be. While it does have an Italian name, the translation is \"The Wine Merchant\" so be prepared for owners and staff who know their wines. If the wine list on the regular menu seems limited to you, do not hesitate to ask for the Sommelier's list - quite a few intriguing wines grace its pages.  As for the food, Chef James and his kitchen staff perform miracles daily. The new menu that was recently rolled out added quite a few tasty new options (a trio of  yummy flatbreads, smothered steak) while retaining some of my personal favorites (Crispy Pork Loin, Baked Cheese & Shells with Cappicola). Additionally, the vegetarian and gluten-free options have expanded.   I frequent Il Vinaio during Happy Hour and dinner time, so I cannot adequately review breakfast or lunch. In my opinion, this restaurant should definitely be on your list to visit. Great food, great wines, fair prices, attentive staff and fine dining all in downtown Mesa. I'm a huge fan!"}
{"text":"great food great staff great atmosphere. happy hour is bomb. endless mimosa?!?!?!?!?!?!?! yes indeed. tables are not crowded together. dog friendly. highly recommend."}
{"text":"Downtown Mesa isn't normally known for higher quality food or destination restaurants, but Il Vinaio is looking to buck that trend. It doesn't look like much from the outside and resides in an older building which resembles a diner built circa 1965. Inside, however, is a whole different story.   The restaurant has a large area in the middle that is mainly open and provides room for the live music. The upper part of the central area has wine related quotes on the walls. It's a nice touch and it adds some airiness to the layout. On either side of this central area is more seating. The tables are cozy and some even have small loveseat-like benched pulled up to them on one side. This was a nice touch and my date and I were able to sit next side by side and view the band (and each other) well. That set up is also conducive for sharing food.  There is a bar in the back corner of the restaurant and that seemed to be the most popular spot because there were only a few other patrons in the restaurant outside of the bar area (pretty empty for a Friday night). The live music is a nice touch, but it can get a little loud, so I'd recommend sitting away from the center of the restaurant if you want any chance of carrying on a conversation.  The wine list is a nice size and is good quality overall. Prices were kind of all over the map: from 1.5 - 3.0x retail. I was pleasantly surprised to see a Consilience Syrah on the menu ($11/glass), so we ordered that. It was absolutely lovely, with rich fruit and a smooth, lingering finish.  The food is basically a hodgepodge of Italian meets Greek meets Spanish combined with a little bit of whatever the chef feels like today. The menu broken in to Starters (apps and salads) and Entrees (fish, meat, and pasta dishes). As you know, I'm a fan of sharing food because it means you get to try more from the menu. Here's a rundown of what we ordered:      * Classico Bruschetta - This was pretty much what you'd expect ingredient-wise: tomatoes, garlic, basil, and Parmesan on toasted bread. However, this was probably the best bruschetta I've ever eaten (and I've had my share, trust me). The bread was toasted perfected in olive oil; slightly crunchy on the outside, yet soft in the middle. The tomatoes were so juicy and flavorful that we were fighting over them. The one warning I will give is that there is no lack of garlic on this.     *  Caesar Salad - Perfect size for sharing. This came with more of those yummy diced tomatoes on top, which I like on a Caesar. The dressing was very nice, with just enough pureed anchovies and garlic to give it a little kick without killing it. Croutons were good, but not great.     * Pasta Pomodoro -Angel hair pasta with fresh tomatoes (you sensing a meal theme here yet?), garlic, basil, and olive oil. Again, the tomatoes just rocked our world. The server split our dish for us, too, which I always appreciate. The pasta was good, but actually a tad bland. I rarely add salt to food after it's cooked, but this dish needed some and a dose of pepper flakes, too.      * Individual Apple Pie - The server may have been trying to get into my date's good graces as this dessert just appeared without us ordering it. We weren't complaining, though, because it was very good. Basically, it was a large ramekin lined with puff pasty, filled with apple pie goodness, and baked. Then topped with vanilla bean ice cream and a little caramel. The pastry was awesome as was the ice cream. The apples were good, but it was a bit much for me after the prior 3 courses. We put a nice dent in it, tho...  Final Take   The service was really top notch and very attentive. The food was solid and the wine selection was very good (beer choices are nice, too). Now whether downtown Mesa is ready for what Il Vinaio is offering is another story and I think that's biggest issue they face. The Mesa Center for the Arts is right down the street, so hopefully concert and theater goers will stumble upon this restaurant. But what I think would help Il Vinaio the most is some competition. My thoughts on this are that when you have a single, high quality restaurant surrounded by lower budget eateries, it's harder to draw the crowd to you. However, if there were a few higher quality restaurants in that area, well now you have something to attract more people. When one place is busy, you go to the next one over and check it out. Il Vinaio deserves to succeed and I hope that Mesa encourages similar caliber restaurants to set up shop.  Overall Grade = B+ (Very Good)  The East Valley Foodie"}
{"text":"I've just been to Il Vinaio twice, both for breakfast... usually I go more before reviewing but the pancakes I had this morning were maybe the most delicious pancakes I've had EVER. They're buttery and moist and basically taste like cake. Who doesn't love cake, right? YUM.   Tried the blueberry crepes which were also fantastic. Service was amazing, super nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after hearing/reading good reviews.  I ordered the Chile Rubbed Teres Major Steak and it came out room temperature.  The broccoli side was tasted like it had just come out of the refrigerator. I sent it back and it came back a few minutes later and the broccoli now tasted like it was dunked in boiling water and dropped right back onto the plate (it was soaking wet). The steak was still room temperature and while better, it was hardly worth the almost $20 it cost. No manager came to ask what the problem was.  Service was mediocre. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Just moved to AZ from NY and stopped into this place near a place I was staying.  Wow!! Amazing service and total wine connoisseurs!  I chatted with The owners and staff all night. The food was delicious and the pairing was perfect.  Highly recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Mesa and the hotel recommended this venue. We were delighted with the food and especially the wine. Nicole was our server and made us feel right at home. We had the steak salad which was expertly seasoned and cooked medium rare as ordered. If we ever come back to Mesa this will be our first stop."}
{"text":"Wonderful comfortable atmosphere   Wonderful selections of beer and wine   Love it!!!  However I will not go there again as the bathrooms ARE NOT WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the antelope burger and it was very good. My fries were a bit undercooked, yet slightly oily, which tells me that the oil temperature needs to be increased and the cooking time needs to be decreased......  My wife had a filet mignon flatbread and we both thought it was quite good. She also had a strawberry salad and liked that very much as well.   The service was a bit wanting......our waittress did not tell us about the specials, and my wife had a bit of food envy when another waitress informed the table next to us what the specials were. This increased when we saw their food brought out. Whatever the special was, it looked great. Also, service was just a bit slow......no big deal because we had plenty of time before our show at Mesa Arts Center, but if I was not killing time, this could have become annoying.   Overall, solid execution on the food, fair service, and interesting environment. I am not clamoring to go back, but I wouldn't be opposed if it was suggested next time I am in Mesa. I say a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"I was invited to Il Vinaio by a group of friends, and we ate there during an Octoberfest food/pairing event. We were not part of the event, however, and sat at a separate table.  About 50% of the food was adequate, the rest being poorly prepared, delivered cold, or overpriced. Here are my chief complaints:  1) $32 for a pitcher of ice and a touch of sangria. No thanks. 2) Overly cooked rice cannot be topped with melted cheese and sold as risotto. 3) Bread should not be harder than the table upon which it is placed. 4) Fondue is not cheese-flavored milk, and should be more viscous than a glass of water. 5) When a guest is dissatisfied with a $127 tab for slow service and underfilled pitchers, you should offer to comp something immediately. 6) If it is not your birthday when you sit down to dinner, it should not be your birthday when you get up to leave.  Our experience was positively awful. Eight of us shared this misery, and none of us will volunteer for this again. There are restaurants in town far more deserving of our money."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a business trip and literally stumbled on this place, looking for some good food and a glass of wine.  FOUND IT!!  Happy hour was in progress (ladies night=Wed) and I got a lovely Ceasar salad (YUM) and a couple of $5 appetizers (wings/bruschetta) and a great wine to go with.   Super good food/friendly service, pleasant atmosphere, great prices, WILL RETURN again next time I am in the area!! This place is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Best kept secret for weekend brunch in Mesa! How the line doesn't go out the door escapes me, but am thankful the crowds have yet to discover this gem in downtown Mesa. Originally a diner, the decor is upscale and tasteful with wine quotes surrounding diners from above with comfy couches available to slide into to enjoy your meal. The owners make this place with their cheerful demeanor and commitment to making your dining experience all it can be. Having enjoyed their weekend breakfasts for over three years, the food is consistent, flavorful, and piping hot. Eggs are always cooked as ordered with a wonderful assortment of bread and jams to accompany them. The menu is delicious with lemon crepes, berry French toast, and Eggs Benedict. Another wonderful feature of this eatery is the ability to order lunch during breakfast hours. Now for the absolute best offering, beside their massive wine selection, is Il Vinaio's 'made from scratch' soups. AMAZING! Lobster bisque, Cream of Salmon, green chili stew, and so many more. Easily the Valley's best soups, hands down. Not to forget the fact coffee cups never go empty!  With the masses waiting 30 plus minutes on a Sunday at some bland chain restaurant, I marvel at how we can stroll in to table at this hidden gem. Price compares to other breakfast places, but is a far finer dining experience. Best breakfast in Mesa easily."}
{"text":"Cozy wine bar with regular life music. Great options especially for brunch.  I love to come here because of the gluten free menu and the owners go out of their way to make sure the food is safe. Owners are very friendly and it almost feels like being greeted by family when you come through the door. Offer gluten free beer, burger buns and pasta.  #happyceliac"}
{"text":"Il Vianio is my new fave Mesa restaurant. Have been going there every week for lunch since I moved here six months ago. Yummy menu with unique dishes...all fresh and beautifully presented. Service is extraordinarily personal with likes/dislikes always remembered. Feels like friends are cooking just for you. If you go for dinner at the bar on Fridays and Saturdays you run into the downtown Mesa business owners after their workday. A fun place to be. And, if my fussy mother loves it, who won't?"}
{"text":"We were excited to try what had the potential to be great, unknown Italian place in downtown Mesa.  After reading other reviews I called to make a reservation (great place must be busy, right?) The gentleman with whom I spoke was very friendly and helpful in scheduling our reservation to ensure we would have plenty of time to make our show at Mesa Arts Center; when I suggested moving it 15mins later he indicated they had several other reservation for that time and we'd best keep the initial time. Well when we arrived the place was mostly empty, no issues getting a table reservations or not. 6-7p on Friday evening and the place was dead. Still had potential, the word was not out yet. Perhaps knowing the facility was once a cafeteria influenced my perspective, initial impressions reminded me of visiting my Italian grandmother's home: it was nice place at one time. They clearly have placed their influence on the decor with an emphasis on wine theme. Not unpleasant but not warm and inviting either.  Our hostess/waitress seated us in what was promised to be a romantic sofa seating, it was ok, chair height cushioned seating on same side of table; not the romantic spot I expected. So this place is supposed to have a good wine selection, great! When asked \"How is the Joseph Carr Cab?\", the response was \"good\"; not a very helpful description nor was it accurate, soft and flat with little fruit would be better description and I'd expect to pay $13/bottle rather than $13/glass. My wife's Syrah was much better choice.  Spinach salad with Pine Nuts and Strawberries for starter, a rather large portion and perfect for sharing. Pretty basic presentation with dressing poured on top rather than dressed prior to plating. Not bad but difficult to eat as it required table tossing.  Filet Minon Flatbread w/Bleu Cheese starter sadly arrived with the salad. It too was ok, filet was tender and tasty, and bleu cheese added just the right twang. For an Italian place I expected homemade flatbread but that was not the case. Overall good flavors.  Time for entrees:  Crispy Prime Pork Loin w/Creamy Fontina Risotto and Caper Berry Sauce and Pappardelle Pasta Florentine w/Spinach Cream Sauce, Fresh Tomato and Lemon w/Chicken which we shared among us. Pork Loin was awesome! Slightly sweat, crispy coating, on a bed of creamy risotto and large caper berries; we could have eaten the whole thing were we not reaching fullness. Pasta Florentine was good, large flat egg noodles which were cooked well, cream sauce and chicken are very good as well. Of the two Pork Loin would be a do-over with no reservations, Pasta would probably not in favor of trying something else. Both were very good leftovers.  Overall I was not impressed, I would probably not make an effort to return. There were two waitresses (and trainee) working this evening, the other waitress could have made this a more pleasant experience as she had a much better handle on things: sharing specials, soup of day, and more helpful descriptions of menu items and wine list; our waitress was missing most of the evening but couldn't have been very busy with many other tables. I do wish them well."}
{"text":"Coming here for brunch was a great idea!!   Our server promptly greeted us at the door. She was warm and inviting. She gave great suggestions and tips. The drinks came at a regular pace, which is always nice! The food was amazing! We all had something different (eggs benedict/blueberry pancakes/omelet/ 2 eggs your way). The portions were quite large and everyone had leftovers. We'll definitely be back...maybe we'll come in the evening for a wine tasting ;)"}
{"text":"The quote of \"A casually elegant American fusion restaurant, wine & beer bar\" really says it quite well. Diverse menu and wine list are well-priced but well done.   Just happened in and enjoyed the meal and the atmosphere. Give it a try, especially as there are multiple arts and entertainment venues nearby. They're ready for you!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place, downtown Mesa needs great restaurants in a bad way. They simply are not that good. Coffee is atrocious, if you are going to try to represent yourself has a fine dining restaurant, you need drinkable coffee. Had pancakes, they were undercooked and doughy. generally too much salt in most the dishes I tried, rice on a salmon special was inedible. Great cheese plate. Good wine list, reasonable price there. It feels like they are trying hard, but coming up short."}
{"text":"We had dinner here after a play at the Mesa Arts Center.  Not the worst but definitely not the best place i've ever eaten.  To be fair, I didn't try anything on the wine menu.  The gluten free menu was the attraction and i suspect that has attracted a few others as well, especially on a Sunday afternoon when not much is open in Mesa.  It's ok, but I wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here many times, for many different occasions, and have never been disappointed. This is also our go-to restaurant to take friends and relatives from out of town (never a bad review). Everything always tastes fresh and the burgers and steaks I've ordered have always been cooked perfectly. A relaxed, low-key atmosphere, along with a very nice and attentive wait staff. We'll be back soon, I'm sure!"}
{"text":"Bland food at high prices.  Not worth your time or money.  I recommend you go elsewhere for tastier, cheaper food with more authentic environments than this faux-elegant shab."}
{"text":"so i'm not sure this is a \"breakfast\" joint.  in fact i'll say that it's more of a lunch and dinner place.  the atmosphere is very large.  dark.  and \"old\" school.  not the wake up and go get a hangover cure typ of place... maybe that's more of the difference between places in tempe, (and certain ones in scottsdale) vs. mesa.  i dunno.  that being said the staff were friendly tho not very attentive when we first walked in.... no one was manning the counter @ the entrance to seat us or offer us a menu.  the place was empty save for 2 other guys.... men i should clarify prob just back from, or about to head to the golf course.  we both ordered belgium waffles and poached eggs with coffee and bacon.  this sounded good and i am happy to report, it did not disappoint. the bacon was SO crispy if fell apart in my hands.... i like it that way.  the waffles were just brown and thick enough to make me happy, and they were vanilla flavoured so that was a nice surprise!!  eggs were done right and the coffee was nice.  the bacon tho as i side i must say seemed a bit expensive....  3.50 for 3 strips of bacon?  really ?  is that the going rate ?  all in all tho this was a good meal , i'm just not sure it's meant to be @ this dark and lonely \"old\" feeling place.  oh well"}
{"text":"Our first evening in AZ.   Wonderful meal.American Fusion cuisine. Ahi tuna was outstanding.  Wonderful chicken roulade.  (Prices pretty reasonable)  Great food.  Nice wine.  Super service. Thanks, Kristen!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place more than a couple of times but this last time I thought was the best.  I had the roasted veggie flatbread which tasted great and was also attractive to look at.  Some of the previous meals I have had there left me wanting . . . wanting less that is, so this little roasted veggie flatbread was a nice find on their menu (see picture).  The bf had the blackened tilapia.  He liked it but I thought it looked too oily for my taste.  He also had the flourless chocolate torte which he said tasted good but wished it would have been bigger.  On one occasion I had the antelope burger which was quite tasty but I did not care for the fries -- don't get me wrong; there was nothing wrong with them but I guess I wish they had more healthy choices to choose from but you can't please everyone.  On another occasion I had the field greens side salad and a soup of the day but didn't care much for either as well -- the house red wine vinaigrette salad dressing was just too acidic.  The place itself is kind of depressing.  Every time we have gone it has been quite empty although admittedly we have been there on off dining hours.  I hope the light-rail helps out their business.  With such a large space, they should consider having a dance night (such as salsa) to draw in people.  One last remark -- the service was good."}
{"text":"My husband and I travel extensively and love food and wine. II Vinaio is a gem. Service is always friendly and prompt . Cindy is an outstanding hostess with great suggestions. They have one of the best burgers in Phoenix area and the garlic on the fries is fantastic.  Howard recommends the green chili hatch humus. I who hate salads will recommend the southwest Cobb salad. Weekend brunch is also good. We travel from  East Mesa for well seasoned, interesting food. We stop often on way from the airport for wine and  lunch on upon returning to town. The wine and beer selections are good.  They are priced for a good restaurant and a better buy than Scottsdale restaurants  We can not understand poor reviews because I know the owners would have promptly worked to resolve any issues. It is priced fairly for the quantity and quality of food. Mesa needs good quality restaurants that serve something other than burgers, Mexican, and diner food. The wine and beer menu is extensive.  On average we eat there 3 times per month. The ladies restroom is always very clean, but sewer gas does occasionally confront many Mesa locations.  I have never found it offensive. Please remember small businesses need opportunities to respond to issues before they are trashed on social media. Linda and Howard"}
{"text":"Man, this place is something of a secret gem and I almost don't want to mention it because it's hip to be unheard of. Still, I want to see them succeed and I loathe hipster douchebaggery, so ...  Il Vinaio is not so much an Italian joint as it is a wine bar with an Italian name. I guess the fact that this used to be the location of a downtown diner confuses people; their menu changes every 6 months or so and it's always interesting.  Their happy hour specials are frequent and well-provisioned. Most days if you casually glance at twitter you'll find some sort of deal going on. They have wines for the upperclass twit wine snob and beer and donut pairings for the belching Homer types. Really. They've got everything, and the owners are some of the friendliest people you'll meet.  They do a very nice breakfast on weekends. On nights where there's live music you can expect a great, fun crowd. With one exception (now gone elsewhere) their servers are fantastic and knowledgeable and very friendly.  I suggest the Antelope burger, medium rare, light on the onions, with a glass of Sean Minor and a Padron '64 afterwards."}
{"text":"Went there Saturday with a group of 12 women.  Although they were preparing for a wedding reception, we received amazing service.   Our waitress was very attentive and no one ever had an empty glass.   We had the brunch with the bottomless Champagne and it truly was bottomless.   We had a variety of items from the brunch menu and I must say, although mine was very good,  I was jealous of a few other plates!   I will be back to try some of those and of course, more champagne!  We were able to chat and had a very good time.   It is a little difficult to get to because of the light rail construction but worth it."}
{"text":"Very nice place and the hatch burger and garlic fries were very good. Great atmosphere and service as well."}
{"text":"Went on a Weds. night before a downtown show. Place is about 1/2 full. Took 30 minutes to receive glass of wine, 45 minutes to receive appetizer. After an hour of waiting finally received meal, which we had 5 minutes to gulp down before rushing out to catch show. Another couple that came in 5 minutes later, never received their meal. This way everytime we go (3rd time). I will not give them another chance. Owner said well, this place is bigger than it looks and we have a small kitchen. ??? Is this my problem?"}
{"text":"Rating would have been a 5* after our initial visit last week, but after tonight, it goes down to just 2*.  They had a \"special\" going that got you 2 entrees and any bottle of wine for $50, however, they were out of four of the bottles we asked for, and would not recommend any of the other Reds...needless to say, we passed on the \"special\" and just ordered our meal.  When my wife asked to substitute the onions on her steak (there were a ton) for another vegetable, the waitress got snippy with us, and said she would ask.  When we got our meal, instead of a different veggie, there was none, essentially her (tiny) steak and a serving of potatos, and that was it.  The bad part was that the waitress never bothered to ask if that was ok, just brought the food and said that they preferred not to make the onions since we said we wanted something else!  Overall, an extremely disappointing experience...too bad too, because our last visit was great."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the PHX area for the holidays and decided to escape the family for a night and have a date night. I came across this restaurant on Yelp and was drawn to their wine selection as well their very gluten friendly menu as I have food allergies. We sat at the small but very cute bar and were extremely impressed the with the service. I believe the married couple working this night were the owners and the male was the one who was waiting on us. They were extremely friendly and hospitable! The quality of food was exceptional as well as were the wine recommendations we were given to accompany our food choices. The antelope burger is amazing! I'm very happy we found this gem of a restaurant because we most surely will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  My favorite is the fried pork chop.  Love when they offer entertainment!  Best selection of wines!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy dining at this low key venue! Choices of wine are abundant! Happy hour provides very affordable small plates...satisfying and delicious! Owners Cindy and Cameron always make every diner feel special without being intrusive! Must make an effort to dine here more often!"}
{"text":"A gem on the west end of downtown Mesa on Main. I am never disappointed by the service, food or drink. They have happy hour every night they are open including weekends. Great appetizers which could easily be a light supper in combination. I highly recommend the pan seared ahi tuna with ginger rice and baby bok choy. The antelope Burger is awesome. All the burgers are very good. During the summer months they have a great wine tasting on Wednesdays. In addition to their extensive wine menu, they routinely feature five or six craft beers on tap including one on Nitro. The room has very good acoustics for occasional live music which fills the room without overwhelming."}
{"text":"My hubby and I stopped in for an impromptu dinner date after escaping an awkward work holiday party with bad, bread-based apps.  We were specifically drawn by the gluten-free menu and the commitment to sourcing local ingredients, and we weren't disappointed.  Rather than one or two safe dishes or having to make a million mods to be able to eat at a lot of restaurants, Il Vinaio had a full menu of possibilities, including multiple dessert options.  I didn't even get a look at the wine list, because the waitress had me at the seasonal Woodchuck Barrel Reserve cider, which had an AMAZING bourbon-like quality.  Wait, I shouldn't be telling you this, because I want to go back and get more before it's gone!    Hubby had the green chile burger, and I had the ancho rubbed steak.  Both of us were quite satisfied with the dishes, which were generously portioned and prepared just as we had ordered.  Best of all, I didn't get sick afterward, which tells me that the kitchen is on their game.  I was very happy with my flourless chocolate torte with berry compote, and my hubby loved his GF brownie sundae.    Great food, relaxed atmosphere, very friendly and attentive service, and a competent kitchen.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"My cousin & I stumbled upon this mesa gem while waiting for the children's museum to open on a Sunday. We had 4 children with two adults. At first glance we were hesitant, however once inside amazed at what we found. A truly vacation worthy atmosphere extremely friendly staff & delicious breakfast!!! Perfect Sunday brunch spot!!!! Kids or not."}
{"text":"My daughter and I went here for dinner to celebrate an occasion that only happens once in a lifetime, Retirement, for me of course. She told me to pick out any place that was different and unique. I searched high and low and behold, II Vinaio.  My daughter didn't sound too pleased of my choice because of her culinary skills and wide range of unique eating establishments but she agreed and we arrived at our reservation time. We could have got away without the reservation.  Our server was very prompt and recited the specials without hesitation, we selected the assorted cheese plate and alligator sausage with some kind of fritter for starters. The cheese platter had an assortment of 3 different cheeses,olives,fruit,nuts,and not enough small toasted bread slices to accommodate all the cheese. The alligator sausage was good but was it really alligator sausage? Not that I eat it all the time,so am I an expert on alligator ? but it was good if it was gator. And any type of batter that is thrown into hot oil is always tasty, the fritter.  The cheese platter was good because the cheese comes from outside vendors and placed on a plate with the proper condiments how can you go wrong,a no brainier here.  My dinner choice was Crispy Prime Pork Loin over fontina risotto and caper berry sauce.That was another disappointment in my life .I also have a large repertoire of fine foods and this was not it. The plating would not have won an academy for best picture because the pounded out paper thin panko crusted pork cutlet was place on top of the dollop size portion of risotto and ugh.   Our server promptly asked us how was the food and I told her that the pictures posted on this site sure didn't look like what I ordered. She told me that those pictures were posted a long time ago and things have changed. Well honey, that's the reason I came here, the pictures of the food were amazing. I've eaten pork loin before, not only in restaurants but I also cook a mean pork roast myself. This was not it!!! All I tasted was panko bread crumbs, where's the pork??  Long grain rice (risotto) with melted cheese, I've had better. My daughter has some kind of salad, just an assortment of greens with venison, nothing special.  The two glasses of Bordeaux were alright but were they Bordeaux?  My daughter should have paid the bill with a picture of a credit card and II Vinaio should have a disclaimer posted on their front door that reads, What you see you may not get."}
{"text":"Excellent wait staff.  Nice wine list.  Bruschetta was tasty.  Ordered chicken saltimbocca and lobster Mac & Cheese flavorful but cold.  Chicken tough, potatoes gummy.  We'll give you one more try as our server was so pleasant. Not what we expected.  Highly recommended to us by friends."}
{"text":"Be aware: they tack on a 18% tip that is labeled \"open\" on the receipt if you use a Groupon. Slow service.  Good food.  The manager is very nice and helped solve my receipt issue."}
{"text":"Mediocre food at best when we went last week. Don't let the Italian name fool you. Very limited Italian menu and when I asked for grated cheese ony angel hair pasta, the waitress looked surprised, went and checked and of course they don't have any. Why would they??? Lame and the wine isn't all that much of a value either.  Better places abound...try anything else."}
{"text":"Amazing place with incredible people who work there. Went there today for the first time and had a great experience,the 2 women who did the serving were fun and outgoing and made you feel welcome and at home. They made you feel  like you were with family. Im definatley going again and look forward to our next visit. So if you like a quiet, relaxing, forget your troubles place and enjoy having a  drink and food with out feeling rushed atmosphere then this is the place. Top notch."}
{"text":"I used yelp to help me find some lunch since I'm not from Arizona. I wanted a gluten free menu and fresh food. The food is all made fresh here and a great gluten free menu was provided. My daughter had s cheese burger she loved it, we shared a shrimp appetizer with sweet chile sauce it was delicious! Our wine was perfect and I had a tuna plate which I asked if they would add a side of the chile sauce. It was good. Our waitress was very friendly said its been slow since building the bus system out front.  Very good food, friendly atmosphere great wine!"}
{"text":"Terrible, horrible, DO NOT GO!!  The staff was rude and readily turned up their nose when 5 adults walked in with 3 children, we were told the only tables they ahd available were their high tops (clearly they were trying to deter us from dining there) when we stated we were fine with a high top it still took more than 5 minutes to get seated and the restaurant only had 2 other tables when we walked in.  The apps were good, but it took more than 40 minutes for the main entrees to come out of the kitchen, during which time we had to ask more than 3 TIMES for our drinks to be refilled...the burger that was ordered medium might as well have mooed at us from the plate, the puntanesca was so salty it was inedible, the lemon chicken was so over cooked wand dry it was like road kill.  When we complained we were told that our meals could be re cooked, but with 3 fussy children and already having to wait more than 40 minutes, we did not have time to wait and see if the dishes would be corrected or not.  We were not offered to have anything removed from our bill, and not even a 'sorry' was given.  We were also charged an 18% auto gratuity because 'technically' we were a party of 8...one child is still breast feeding, and the other two didn't even have childrens items ordered for them as they were eating off our plates...this place has terrible food, bad service, and staff that does not care!!"}
{"text":"It's disappointing to have to say that our dinner, on a very slow Tuesday night, was less than impressive. The menu is oddly broad. While much is Italian, there is a smattering of other types, such as Asian Ahi or Caribbean Mahi Mahi. They do have a large wine list.  The food was good (not great) -- both appetizers and main dishes. But there was no flair or style to the service or presentation. Just food placed on white dishes.  The greatest impact had to do with acoustics. There were several people in the bar area who had a long, loud conversation (tile floors reflected the sound). This was impossible to ignore and lessened our experience."}
{"text":"Great location for a pre-event (Mesa Arts Center) meal! Had the panko-breaded crispy pork loin with a side salad, and Vinaio Bruschetta for an appetizer. Yum! Very attentive staff, reasonable prices. Would come here again!"}
{"text":"I am ok with making the baseless claim that this is the only wine bar in Mesa...because in my Napa snob book it is.  They have a great assortment of wines.  You might get lucky enough to be there on a tasting night, where one of the owners are probably pouring you the wines and can describe them as well as the winemaker.  The husband/wife team is also usually on hand to make sure your food is made to your liking.  I've had their duck and filets, all cooked to my liking. And my low carb requests are always accommodated with extra veggies - usually asparagus. Then again, my low carb diet goes out the window when the desert menu is so delicious!  This is a great place for a good group of friends to enjoy wine to an intimate dinner with a loved one. Quiet during the weekdays, but busy on the weekends.  The ambiance is warm...and feel like I'm walking into a cafe in Tuscany.  The classiest restaurant on Main Street.  Mesa needs more restaurants like this!"}
{"text":"This is the second time we have been here. And had I rated it the last time I would have given it 5 stars. I bought the coupon on restaurant. com for this outing since there were 5 of us - 50 off of 100. When we arrived it was still happy hour so we ordered 3 appetizers right off the bat. The hummus,  yum and 2 orders of the chicken croquettes, so so. The appetizers came out in about 10 minutes.  Pretty good timing and our server had our drinks as well. I ordered the steak and all though she said it was super tender, it wasn't and it was cold with cold butter on top. My daughter had the salmon witch was ok and my husband the fillet. Which was also tough. 2 others had the pasta which was amazing but served with over cooked chicken. Ok all that about the food but literally it took about 35 minutes and there were only 3 tables in the entire place with people.  Another couple was seated at the same time we were and they actually left after getting apps and a meal while we were still \"lingering\" over our apps.  So ... what I want to say here is that I was super disappointed at the end of the day. My hopes were high for this place after a good experience back in January. Also not to be picky but they charged me full price for the apps because I had the coupon even though we were well over the 100.00 before the apps were added. We did have desert as well but nothing to write home about. So any way they added the extra to our bill in the end. I think that for a place that is super empty,  they may want to consider this policy, it was only 11 more dollars but still... so this is the third time I have used a coupon from restaurant.com and the 3rd disappoint. I dont think we will go back again:( too bad because I think this place is super cute and has potential."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim due to the large gluten-free menu and were floored from beginning to end. The gluten-free bruschetta as an appetizer was delectable. We ordered a second appetizer because the first was so good. For entrees, the lobster Mac, chicken Parmesan, pasta Vinaio and Vinaio burger were all perfection. The deserts (all gluten-free) were sumptuous. Treat yourself and make this a destination dinner!"}
{"text":"OK you guys let's talk about this place.  Another example of a concept missing the mark.  Sigh.  I was drawn here by the menu on the website while looking for a new place for date night.  Specifically the Asian ahi tuna.  The place is a converted family dining restaurant and you can tell but whatever.  Pretty good wine selection i guess,  I'm not a wine guy.  Not much of a beer selection for being a beer and wine bar.  Had a $13 glass of zinfandel.  Um yeah come on.  OK shrimp and seaweed salad app,  tiny but tasty I guess.  Salad was not unlike anywhere else,  sushi bar or Chinese buffet included.  Shrimp pan cooked with what seemed to be grocery store sweet chili sauce. Whatevs I'm here for the ahi. Menu lists it as coriander crusted with pickled veggies, sriracha aioli,  and curried risotto cake.  Um actually says the waiter,  that's now sesame crusted with ginger rice and steamed veggies.  seriously?  OK I'll have the crispy pork loin with orange caper berry sauce.  It would have been more accurately described as breaded pork chop with watery sauce and giant whole caper berries and onions on top.  I thought maybe the risotto was too watery and leaked onto the plate, then I realized it was supposed to be the sauce.  I was expecting a berry sauce with capers. And I don't know how you bread a pork chop like that in real life. It was like something from the grocery store freezer.  Or Dennys or something. Rubbery.  This is not pork loin. She had the antelope burger and gave a good review. Had the comfy couch table in the corner with a sweet view of the servers station.  How about a curtain? This is a different and overdue concept for downtown mesa but they're not executing."}
{"text":"The food was serviceable but not great. We went for happy hour but we don't drink. Maybe it's better with a couple of drinks in you.   The atmosphere is fun. We enjoyed sitting on a couch while eating. The music mix is very eclectic."}
{"text":"My mother received a coupon and wanted to try Il Vinaio before a show at the Mesa Arts Center. I had only been for dinner there once before a couple of years ago, and remembered that the service was so deplorable that we were worried that our host was embarrassed to have brought us there. But the restaurant was new and I understand that it takes time to work out the kinks. Turned out that this particular kink has not yet been untwisted.                The service is incongruent to the nice atmosphere and good menu. It's not just that the servers dress in jeans, tennis shoes and, I think, t-shirts, but that the quality of the work revealed the absence of proper training. Ex: no tray-jack, just set the entire large tray directly on our table, serving entrees while all of the appetizer and salad plates were still uncleared, never removing dinner plates, (we had to push the empty plates aside to do the check), no bussers which  decreased the amount of time we saw our server and greatly contributed to poor service.         \"Hi guys. My name is N_____. Let me tell you guys about the special.\" And then she literally began the description with, \"It comes with....\" She said the entire special backwards so that we had to wait until the end to know what the entree actually was! It went like this,\" It comes with X and Y over some (pasta?) and then you can get either A or B (fish or chicken maybe).\" The way she told it was impossible to get a visual and I was so distracted by the delivery that I couldn't remember what the special was 10 seconds after she \"described\" it. Oh goodness.         I ordered from an exciting gluten-free menu, which is a rare treat. I chose the braised lamb ragu with pappardelle pasta. My daughter wanted the same dish which was on the regular menu. However she told the server that she would go ahead and get the gluten-free as well, in order \"to make sure the [identical] dishes don't get mixed up.\"  When the meals arrived, the lamb ragu was over CAPELLINI. When I told the server, she unapologetically said, \"Oh, angel hair is the only gluten free pasta we have\". I told her that my daughter never would have ordered the lamb ragu in gluten-free had she known. Our server didn't do anything with this piece of information to satisfy the problem. This would have been a good time for her to have told the owner that his/her error on the menu had caused two guests disappointment. Maybe at Il Vinaio they think, \"Ahh, pasta is pasta. Who cares what shape it's in?\"    Uh....we do!            Important note: Ineptitude aside, the lamb ragu was DELICIOUS.         However my father, who just had dental surgery, ordered tomato soup as his entree along with a sweet potato side. I don't believe that the same person who made the lamb ragu could possibly have made that soup. It was very watery and barely tasted of tomato. Dad's incredulity that it was being passed off as tomato soup caused him to want everyone at the table to try it.  And unfortunately for him, the sweet potato mash was not sweet as sweet potatoes usually are. After complaining about the soup, he received the black bean soup. The beans were undercooked, thus hard and unchewable for him. To top it all off, he had ordered an O'Douls over a half hour prior and had given up on it. In our attempt to assuage his suffering, we reminded the server who then brought it.         When she brought the bill, I asked if she had taken anything off for not serving papardelle as the menu said. She replied, \"I already took off his soup, sweet potatoes and O'Douls\". I reminded her that the beer was 30 minutes late, and that the food he ordered was not good. I should have told her that in the restaurant business, once a drink takes 20 minutes to get to a guest, you give it to him with a sincere apology and it's comped. And when your guests find your food inedible, of course you do not charge them for that either.  Neither of which is a favor.         I then talked to the owner about the menu item switch. She apologized for it. I told her that I didn't mind for myself since I'm just glad to get a good GF meal, but that something ought to be taken off of my daughter's entree since she never would have ordered the dish had she known that it was not as described. The owner did absolutely nothing except to apologize again. I was stunned by the owner's inaction. She  probably figured we were never coming back so why compensate for that particular error. If that was her thinking, she assessed the situation incorrectly. It's so hard to find a good gluten-free meal that I would definitely have gone again.       I noticed a lively bar with about 10 seats. Il Vinaio is probably great for a drink and some socializing at the bar. Also I would mention the GF menu to anyone needing to follow that diet. But I offer a warning about the service.  The establishment is too nice and has too much going for it for the owners to overlook this shortcoming."}
{"text":"The decor is pretty dated, but comfortable and friendly. I was pleased the had gluten free options. I got the gluten-free BLTA and was surprised at how much crunchy bacon it had. The avocado was well ripened and the right amount too."}
{"text":"I had chicken routalade and my spouse had the vegetable pasta.  My food alright, not impressed and would not order it again.  The veggie pasta, was pretty skimpy on the vegetables which was a disappointment.  The waitress did suggest a red wine which turned out to be very good.  The service was good but the food was not impressive.  All in all a little disappointed with this place.   The also don't serve the typical bread which is unusual for an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I take back what I said about II Vinao being mismanaged.  I guess they where just having an off day.  The owner contacted me wanting details so that all problems could be fixed.  How great is that?  We will definitely be dropping by again sometime soon.  This place has what it takes to get a 5 star review from me I'm sure of it...I'll make sure to keep everyone posted."}
{"text":"A few months back I went to Il Vinaio on a whim for supper with a friend of mine. The restaurant was nearly empty, but our waiter was excellent, our food was served promptly and was delicious. I also ordered a glass of Sangria which was heavenly. I half-joked to the waiter that I wanted to buy a gallon of the stuff to take home with me for a get together I was having that night, and the waiter and staff were so accommodating. They sent me home with 5 freshly made bottles of sangria and a container of fresh sliced fruit garnish. It was a very good experience and I have been trying to get some of my friends to join me for a meal there ever since.  Well, last week I got together a group of 8 diners and we decided to go there for dinner. Two of the diners would be enjoying their last dinner there before returning home to England. I realized several hours before dinner that there would be an Oktoberfest Beer dinner that evening, and called to make sure that regular service would be offered. It was, and I reserved a table for 7pm. Three people were there right on time, and the rest of the party arrived a little bit late but staggered, no later than 7:20. I'm not sure if our waitress had never waited table before, or was just highly incompetent at her job, but the entire meal was a disaster from the beginning. The beer dinner taking place in the center of the restaurant was not as busy as I had expected it to be, and there might have been a couple of other tables in the restaurant, I'm not sure. Our waitress didn't get all of our orders taken until after 7:45. Bread arrived 10 minutes later, stale and cold. A couple of friends ordered pitchers of Sangria, which was not quite as good as the batch that I'd purchased previously, but still very good. However, the pitchers were tiny, filled to the top with ice, and $34 each. Most of our water glasses remained empty for long periods at a time while our waitress was nowhere to be found. The food was also very inconsistent with my first visit - I had tried the mac and cheese which was delicious and rich, and my friend that ordered it received a bowl of runny cheese-milk with noodles in it. The sauce on the mac and cheese was identical to the \"fondue\" appetizer she'd ordered. I ordered a grilled flatbread with cappicola, and what arrived was a glorified tortilla with some cheese and ham sprinkled on top. It was not a $12 meal. Some of the food was delicious, but the inconsistency was truly astounding. My husband's sirloin burger was cooked perfectly and was delicious. Another friend ordered the antelope burger, and stated that he preferred his meat as rare as possible, but as he'd never eaten antelope he would like the chef to prepare the burger as he recommend it be eaten. The burger came out well done, tough, and underseasoned. I also had this item on my first visit, ordered medium, and it was perfect. Our food did take a very long time to come out, which I could attribute to the kitchen being tied up cooking for the beer dinner. However, we were a large, paying party who made sure that regular service would be an option before we came. There were so many more issues with the food and service. I was appalled that I had so highly recommended the restaurant and taken a large group there. It was a disappointing meal for every single member of our party. This review would be much longer if I detailed each member's order and the multiple issues with each.  I am not a confrontational person. I have worked in food service before and the experience we had was inexcusable. My husband picked up our portion of the check and I left as a couple of our more confrontational party members said something to the waitress. Nothing was comped, no apology was given or explanation made, and none of us will be back. I had such high hopes for this restaurant after my first visit. I am saddened that my second experience was so disastrous. Downtown Mesa needs good local businesses and restaurants, and I was so excited that this would be one. If this is a typical experience I expect they won't last another year. Please, show me this was a fluke!"}
{"text":"First time at Il Vinaio but had to do take out due to other commitments. Arrived at 4:30pm on a Wednesday and it was deserted. Hostess obviously greeted me right away and accommodated me with a gluten free menu.   Since I did take out, she warned me that GF pasta takes 20 minutes. No prob there so she offered water during my wait.   Dinner arrived right on time: 20 minutes after she turned in the ticket. We ordered Classic Bruschetta on GF bread. It was toasted just right with herbaceous tomatoes on top. For entrees we got the Pasta Vinaio with GF pasta and Chicken Roulade (no gluten adjustments needed.). Each dish was well prepared with saucy goodness, goat cheese and sun dried tomatoes.   The total was $43 for two entrees and an app but for hard-to-find gluten free Italian, it was worth the price.   We will return when we have time to have a good sit down meal."}
{"text":"We were just there last night for my friend's bachelorette party. The place was surprisingly empty for a Saturday evening honestly. I was surprised. Regardless, I ordered a moscato (super tasty!). Our server was super slow despite there only being a few other people in the restaurant. We wondered a couple times if he was coming back. After ordering the steak and twice baked potatoes, we had a great time catching up!  Here's the reason for the 1 star: I am allergic to shellfish. Typically not super severe, but enough to cause vomiting and a swollen throat/tongue. I haven't had a formal reaction in years. My friend/bride-to-be ordered Lobster Mac and Cheese. I didn't think anything of it because the place seemed super nice and 99% of the time, most places will have separate areas for seafood, beef prep, etc. Unfortunately, my potatoes got cooked in the same steamy oven as her lobster (as told to us by the owner). I took one bite of my potatoes and immediately started having a reaction, swelling tongue and all. My friend came to check on me and I told her I was having an allergic reaction as I was throwing up in the restroom. Her sister got the owner and he went to investigate. The thing that bothers me is while this is all going on, never once did he actually talk to ~me~, everything was communicated through my friend's sister and I never once saw him personally. He took the food off the bill but we still had a charge for the wine that I half drank. My friend called my husband to pick me up and I ended up in the ER from about 10:30pm until about 1am so I could breath. For the owner's credit, he did openly admit that they didn't think cooking in the same area would cross contaminate and they would be changing their procedures. The main reason for my 1 star is that I wished the owner would have actually talked to me instead of avoiding me. It's embarrassing on both our ends, but it doesn't make me feel any safer when I seem to have been avoided when I was able to be out. Mistakes happen, and hopefully get fixed, and I definitely understand that. I just felt like the whole situation was treated more as an inconvenience rather than a serious health issue."}
{"text":"EDIT- Letter back to the Owner:  Cameron- I appreciate you writing back. I actually responded to your message on Yelp that I had come in on Wednesday night, November 4th, right after your Happy Hour had ended. I appreciate you retraining the staff on how customer disappointment should be handled, and clearly you found our order and waitress that had helped! I had expressed to her the fries were raw, and still think it's strange that she did not offer anything after the fact.  I do apologize if I said the food took 40-when it had taken 30 minutes.I still think that's a long time for raw fries and an overcooked burger when there was maybe 4 other people in your large establishment. And to address your last point-The broccoli soup was extremely grainy, but the caprese salad was tasty.Fresh mozzarella, tomato slices and spinach.  As a reviewer, the only thing I can do is be honest about my experience. Although it is not reflective of everyone's experience, that is how I tasted and was treated that evening.   Thank you."}
{"text":"We had a very pleasant experience at Il Vinaio. The service was excellent, the food was good and the atmosphere was warm and inviting. Excellent wine list as well as beer list. I went with my wife and 5 year old son and we all enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I just had the nicest time here.  I had a Groupon for 2 glasses of wine and a cheese plate, I went with my BFF and we added a Lobster Benedict to our order.  Our waitress was friendly and funny, I felt like I knew her from somewhere.  Our wine was served first, a generous and well presented serving in a decanter.  followed shortly by our cheese plate.  The brie, when put onto the toast (she sai it was just some oil and herbs) was inexplicably delicious, it was like angels toasted and buttered it themselves, sniff."}
{"text":"If I could divide the number of stars between the service and the food the server would have definitely received 5 stars. But the food? OMG it was barely eatable. I had the filet Mignon with wilted spinach, gruyere mashed potato, and ancho demi-glaze sauce. How could THAT be without flavor I have no idea but the chef managed to leach every bit of taste right out of it. It wasn't just the steak either; the potatoes and spinach had absolutely no discernable spice on it. I had to pour tons of salt on it just to eat it and I'm not one to salt anything. My husband had the Chicken Roulade with sun dried tomato, spinach, goat cheese, with mushroom risotto and lemon basil beurre blanc. I tasted that and the same thing - flavorless! This was a huge disappointment because the menu looked wonderful and it was close to where we live. But there is no way this restaurant can survive. As if that wasn't injury enough I did not enjoy the glass of wine I had, which they are supposedly known for and it was extremely pricy. I would never eat there again."}
{"text":"I have been coming to il Vinaio for over a year now and I have never been made to feel like anything other than a friend here. The service is excellent and the staff are very knowledgeable. I recommend it to everyone I can as a place to celebrate or just to enjoy a delicious meal. I can't wait for the next donut and beer event."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but no other customers on a Wednesday at lunch time.  Decent menu though a bit on the pricey side.  Wine was 2 for 1 at lunch... thought that was nice.  Great service.  Ordered the Vegetable Pasta and was looking forward to the zucchini and asparagus.  It was way to peppery yet bland.  Could have used more cheese also.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We returned to Il Vinaio for an anniversary dinner, and it was every bit as good as the first time! Cameron was very friendly, and true to his word did offer us a flourless chocolate torte on the house. I am happy to report that it was fantastic! I do think we shall be coming back to Il Vinaio as regulars. :-)"}
{"text":"Went for the carne fest and it was probably the worst experience I have ever had for the $45 I paid for dinner. The waitress couldn't remember to bring me my drink, the food was either under or over-cooked, service lacked professionalism and they ran out of nearly everything.   I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Eggs Benedict w/ lobster on gluten free eng. muffin and blueberry  crepes. Both meals were well executed and fairly priced. Our waitress turned out to be the owner, which is always appreciated by a fellow shopkeeper. In the downtown/civic district of Mesa , and within a very dated building, the ambiance is classy and understated. I hope to return for the beer and wine. $3 pints of craft brew at brunch!  Very quiet on a Sunday morn. a nice escape."}
{"text":"I really appreciate having a restaurant / wine bar in central Mesa. It is great to have a place for great food and wine. I love the Crispy  Pork Loin with Creamy Fontina Risotto and Caper Berry Sauce.  The pork is crispy and tenter, the risotto  is rich and creamy, and the caper berry sauce is the perfect counter balance. Wow what a dish. It is addictive. Their other food is great also. They have a great selection of wines. they have great wine dinners and happy hour specials. The owners are very nice and attentive, they really make you feel at home. Gotta go, writing this has made me hungry for  Il Vinaio."}
{"text":"Very good service.  The Antelope burger and bruschetta were very god as was the spinach salad."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Filet was unevenly cooked.  Food seemed a bit under-seasoned.  I question if it was actually a filet and not a mock tenderloin.  Not the tenderness one would expect of a filet. Chicken order was mediocre at best.  Price for quality is not equal.   Live music = one man band sound was excessive to the point that we asked if it would be turned down.    My normal rule is of a place is vacant of customers, don't eat there but the waiter said it was because they were in the off season. I was also watching time or I would have walked out to find something else.   3 stars for cleanliness, atmosphere and service.  So if you have low expectations and want some wine and a hang out spot Yes. Don't go for the food."}
{"text":"Well this is a local business  which is a wine bar which they had a good selection of but all in the pricier range. 48$ or so on up for the most part and trying to serve gourmet food which they  truly do not have an overly creative menu  we started with the pear and Brie Bruchetta where the crouton they served it on was way to thick the pear was cut into micro pieces and sautéd with cinnamon top with a piece of Brie tasted more like a desert than a app my wife had the stuffed mushroom with purée Carott and sauté spinach all done well  I had the duck confit served with gnocchi which the duck was shredded and the gnocchi looked like it was put in a pan and got a blackened on on side but still tasted ok . Our wait person was over the top friendly but all and all the staff is very pleasant .there was a good crowd there to see a musician by the name of Michael powers who is a Seattle guy and we are also transplants from Seattle as well so we were familiar with him he's really a smooth jazz guy ( not my cuppatea) but we chatted with him a bit and he is very pleasant and outgoing . And had quite a az following"}
{"text":"Let's begin with the food, I would classify the cuisine as a modern take on old Italian. Very fresh ingredients prepared to order.  The executive chef definitely has classic and modern training. A wide selection of wine to please any palette,  always looking forward to my next visit.    The staff and owners genuinely care for their customers. always a top notch experience"}
{"text":"Good food w/ interesting combination of ingredients. Good selection of beer & wines and good hard working staff. Some fun beer & wine events too. Beer & donut pairing tasting is really good, I wish they would do it more often. One of the very few full service restaurants in downtown Mesa."}
{"text":"This place rules! Please support his business. Food is tasty! Mesa needs to support awesome businesses like this one!"}
{"text":"This was a great find in downtown mesa! I had a client meeting during lunch and the staff was great at stepping in at just the right times. The food is excellent. I had a massive burger with what tasted like fresh cut fries. The salads were large and no one complained about their food and everyone praised the service. It was quiet during lunch because of the summer but don't let that keep you away. It's worth checking out!"}
{"text":"It is right on the corner of Main and Country Club, and one might not see much on the outside, but really you should check it out. It is really pretty inside. The food is amazing, and they have quite the menu. Offering tapas, gluten free options, happy hour, and serving brunch on the weekends. Plus they have bottomless champagne (mimosas) for $8! Amazing!!!   The one thing I notice is it is a large space, with not that many people in it. Hopefully more people will check it out because it is a very cool wine bar that is good for groups. Most wine bars are small so getting a group of friends all together can be tough. Not here! You're good to go."}
{"text":"As I've said in past reviews, I don't write many reviews but there are times when I feel that I should and this review is a little late in coming.  My husband and I really love this place.  In Mesa this really is our Cheers. The owners Cameron and Cindy are about as welcoming as you can get.  Owning a restaurant can't possibly be an easy thing to do, but they sure do it with a smile.    So last week we decided on a Tuesday night that we'd go to dinner at iLv, because he hadn't been in a while, I asked what the specials were on FB and we were pretty set on what we were going to have for dinner that night. Not to mention that I was totally craving their classic bruscetta it simply is the best I've ever had.  I could eat that as a meal all on its own.  My husband had the trout special and really enjoyed it, I had a bite and was pleased that it didn't have that fishy taste that trout can sometimes have.  I can't really speak for him on his experience but I sure can speak for mine.  I had the beer battered fish and chips, and all I can say is OMG.  I have had good fish and chips very rarely here in the United States, and I'm very selective about it,  because I got spoiled when I visited the UK.  If you've never had fish and chips in England you must put this on your bucket list. But back to this particular fish and chips.  I would pit this up against anything I had in the UK, it was just THAT good. The batter was light and airy and not dripping with grease.  My 5 stars is for that fish alone, if I could add more stars just because of service I would.    Good wine, good food, and good company. How can you go wrong?  Oh yeah, don't leave without having the gellato."}
{"text":"The translated \"Il Vinaio\" is an ancient Italian word meaning \"polished turd\". The pretentious menu, the \"Denny's\" environment. The dated and uninspiring wine list. Fake yelp reviews, rude replies to yelp reviews.  Reviews that have no other reviews or friends, are obviously  fake yelp profiles, sad . Clearly unprofessional \"foodies\" have no place in the restaurant industry, this place makes the Taco Bell next door  look bad. Keep polishing that turd, I heard the best way is to suck at both ends."}
{"text":"They have a unique menu, great beer selection, and wine you can't get in other places.  We got great service, talked to the owners for a while...and we'll be coming back for more tastings.  The prices are also very reasonable for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Local sourced organic ingredients and a new chef and menu makes this a must do. Soups are excellent flavor and not salty. The hatch chili is just right in several dishes. You will really like!"}
{"text":"Love love II Vinaio! Fantastic wines and food! The owners are a fantastic couple and is always very welcoming to my partner and I."}
{"text":"First time visiting this place.  Tuesday night and at one point we were the only ones in the restaurant.  That was a little different for me, but soon others showed.  It's kind of nice not to bump elbows with other people everywhere I go.    Very friendly staff with smiles.  I hate getting low on drinks and asking for a refill.  That never happened here and our server was very attentive.  I will say I was not a fan of the music.  A more classical or mellow fare would have been more appropriate.  I don't like hearing U-2 followed by crappy Sting songs, etc..  The food was superb.  My wife ordered the southwest cob salad.  It was huge and the lettuce was very fresh.  More than enough for one person to eat at a very good price.  I ordered the lobster mac-cheese.  Absolutely fantastic.  It was very mello and not caked in salt.  I'm glad they do it that way as I can add more if I need to (and I did just a bit), but id rather add then be soaked in it.  I would have preferred that my glass have a straw.  I don't like putting my lips on restaurant glasses.  I did not ask for one though.  Also, there was a musty smell coming from the kitchen at times.  I assumed it was from washing the dishes.  That's just a heads up to the staff, but not that big a deal."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. There were several good wines on their list to choose from and the food is well prepared. I've had breakfast and dinner at this restaurant and both meals were delicious. There was also no wait which was a bonus as well! Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Wow, I don't come out to Downtown Mesa too often, but found this gem on Main Street. I had the most perfect Turkey Club Sandwich there on this recent trip. Customer Service was just awesome, they were cheerful and very helpful. I'm definitely going to try this place again for dinner and I hear they host some special events."}
{"text":"We had a group there for dinner last night for my bachelorette party. We had a wonderful time until we got our food. My friend who ordered steak and potatoes started having an allergic reaction. Her food had been cross contaminated with shell fish. After my sister talked to the manager I believe we found out they had cooked the shell fish and her potato in a convection oven together. I understand accidents happen, but I cannot believe that NO ONE in the restaurant came to our table and apologized to her and no one offered to call an ambulance while her throat was closing. Her husband had to come get her and take her to the ER, this is completely unacceptable. And then they had the audacity to give her a pay stub for her one glass of wine as her husband was on his way to get her as she's going to the bathroom throwing up and struggling to breath. Completely disappointed in this establishment."}
{"text":"This place was terrible, worse then terrible. Food was awful.service terrible. Please don't waste your money on this place, there are other places to do that.server was Cindy, brought wine when it wasn't ordered, never even asked us if we were interested in dessert, not that we would.  Wasn't cheap either."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Mesa... They have very good organic bison burgers very tasty.  Also good selection of wines and beers. Waiters are friendly and helpful.Me and my wife had there lunch first and we really liked the place and dice dead to go there for dinner."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the positive reviews for this place!  It's not what one would expect for a \"wine bar\".  We had happy hour food only and I'm glad we didn't waste our money on a meal.  The place was empty on a Friday night. We had the four cheese \"flatbread\" which was not flatbread at all!  It seriously was more like a frozen Red Baron pizza.  It was a (horrible) round premade crust with a bland tomato sauce with cheddar and mozzarella on top and sprinkled with dried spice flakes.  It looked like a pizza and tasted like a bad cheap pizza. Didn't complain because it was only $5 and if they think that is flatbread, then there is no point in complaining. The person next to us had a salad and it was all iceberg lettuce with cheap grocery store croutons - not a green item in it! My wine was old, it tasted like the bottle had been open for a week.  The wine pour was very light compared to the regulars sitting at the bar.  Their wine pours were much larger than mine. I really didnt want more of the wine anyway but need to mention that customers notice when your wine pours are not equal to all patrons. For $9 glass (happy hour $7) I expect better wine.   My husband liked the Deschutes beer -we are from Bend ironically; -)   Lastly, my husband and I were talking amongst ourselves calculating the tip (we were discussing how much 25% would be- but left less after this incident) and the owner buts in and says \"Is something the matter?\"  Then proceeds to explain the bill to us like we're idiots. It was embarrassingly rude to point out the happy hour discounts in front of everyone at the bar as though we were concerned with the prices when we never asked her a thing!  This was SO rude that it pushed us over the edge after the already bad experience and couldn't get out quick enough!"}
{"text":"Had the antelope burger for lunch. Wow so so tasty. Very lean and healthy. The pork belly and bean soup was to die for.  Roasted veggie flatbread was so good. So basically anything you order from this place will be awesome. Only problem is that I'm working and can't enjoy a nice glass of wine with lunch."}
{"text":"Ok, so I went here with my Mom and a group of people for her birthday.  The drinks were good, I'm under 21 so I had a raspberry iced tea, which was good, and everyone that had wine or beer thought it was a great selection.  For an appetizer I tried the chicken wings, which were huge (bigger than my fist) and very delicious, being only $5 on the happy hour menu, it was a great deal. It came with 3 wings.  For my entree I tried the chile rubbed mejor steak.  It was $20, and the disappointment was bigger than the steak.  The steak was smaller than the chicken wings were, with even less flavor.  I honestly don't even know how they removed as much flavor as they possibly could from their steak.  The size of the steak alone made me want to leave upon looking at it, but the hopes of flavor kept me going, only to end up wanting to cry in the spiciest mashed potatoes I have ever had.    In the end, I wish I had only had more of the chicken wings.  The drinks, wings, and service were the only things that kept me from getting too upset.  At the time.  This happened a few weeks ago and I wasn't going to write a review, but I've had this eating at me and pissing me off at random times.  I WILL NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN.  If you're a steak fan, I wouldn't go here.  The chicken wings were the only things on the menu that looked appetizing to me."}
{"text":"Where do I start? This place is amazing! I found out about it via restaurant.com! The food is made to order! The service is freakin amazing! The first time I ordered breakfast and it was great! The pancakes are better than Ihops pancakes! For my birthday I got the antelope burger and it was cooked to perfection! They are cordial and welcoming! The owners love good conversation! They accommodate all your dietary needs without fuss! They also have events that make you appreciate great food and drinks! Anytime family comes in town I always take them there! The food is fresh and taste fresh as well! I have to be careful with kids because my son is allergic to many things but they have no problem meeting those needs! They have an email list to keep up with all the good things going on! If you are in Mesa hit downtown and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"il vinaio is a pleasure! The food is fantastic - very robust flavors and a menu that is constantly being updated. Service is friendly and atmosphere is phenomenal. The owners are very involved and work tirelessly to know their customers and create a warm, inviting environment. John - the musician that plays requests on Saturday nights is great fun.  This is a place for friends, family, kids. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Top notch. Great beer selection, great wine selection, and the food is fantastic. The owners are incredibly friendly. I'll be coming here for years."}
{"text":"Went for brunch today by suggestion of a friend and was very pleasantly surprised.   Our server was very friendly and attentive and helped us with the menu and any questions we had...   Some of the things that made me love this place was 1- the bottomless champagne brunch 2-the food was great.   I got the green Chile burger substitute for chicken and it was delish ! 3-BOTTOMLESS CHAMPAGNE...   I will be going again!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. I had never even heard of this place, but live so close.  It wasn't until a friend of mine invited me to dinner here, that I got the opportunity to check it out.  Wow! I was impressed. I can't believe I have been missing out on this for years!  I ordered their pork loin, which was recommended, and it was amazing.  One of the best dishes I have ever tried. I will return."}
{"text":"This is a very nice addition to the downtown Mesa landscape.  Great food, great room.  It's hard to explain the nuances of the place, but the web site will give you a pretty good sense.  The vibe, food, music are all good.  In the evenings, the owners are very visible.  When you are there, you basically feel like you are at a house party at their house.  The servers are all very upbeat as if they like being there also.    The night I was there, guitarist Carmine D'Amico was leading a jazz quartet that sounded great.  Carmine is studio legend who retired to Arizona after living in New York for his entire life.  I'm not a wine expert, but friends who were there were very happy with their choices.  I had a rigatoni dinner with marinated tenderloin tips, artichokes and some other veggies mixed in.  It was really, really good.  Not your everyday pasta.  Apparently, the dinner menu is created by the chef who came over from the Roaring Fork.  I believe it.  I also went in for breakfast.  The room seemed to have lost a little bit of the vibe and was much more of just a restaurant.  I'm not sure if the new chef put together the menu as it seemed to be pretty standard fare.  Nonetheless, my wife was very happy with her salad and I had a really nice breakfast wrap.  The other reviewer who said that the place seems like Denny's on the outside is spot on.  In fact, the place used to be a diner.  The new people have done wonders transforming the inside.  I wouldn't necessarily consider the breakfast a 5-star experience, but dinner is without a doubt.  If you like the finer things and want a place to become a regular where you can relax and feel comfortable, this is a good place to check out."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years & while we aren't disappointed we really wish they would revitalize & freshen up their menu. It has been the same for YEARS. Service is good & the food is good but getting boring."}
{"text":"I'm not sure about other people's experiences, but anytime I have come to il Vinaio I have had nothing but quality food and drink. Could the service use some work, sure. There is never a time the customer service doesn't need work. The food is a completely different story and I have never been disappointed by the food. Or wine. Ever.   There is a variety of foods that range from any of the appetizers to entree meals- it's all well done and good. The menu has items on it for everyone from the courageous to the not so brave diner. The chef had a watermelon gazpacho a while back and it was amazing! Same thing with the Antelope burger, Elf Fillet and Venison ( I think it was). Their twice baked potato is so flavorful too.   I will say that the parking kinda sucks and there has been construction for the lightrail going in there. And the area is kinda sketchy at night. But its worth a try."}
{"text":"Good food but presentation was lacking. Spotty service but kind staff. Wine list decent but when I switched from white to red I wasn't given a new glass."}
{"text":"They have horrid food, over cooked rice and sloppy risotto.  Unseasoned, food comes out in 5 minutes.  Very overpriced for what you get will never come back.  They use wine bar as an excuse to show up there.  Would order wine and never food."}
{"text":"Doesn't even deserve 1 star.  My husband and I went here last night to grab dinner before a concert at the Mesa Arts Center.  We arrived at 6 and the show started at 7:30.  The hostess asked if we were going to the show and we said yes. We were seated immediately...the place was not even half full.  Waited a good amount of time before our server came to the table to take drink orders.  Waited 20 minutes for 2 glasses of wine.  Ordered our food which consisted of a salad, grilled flatbread and a burger with fries.  The salad came after we had been there for about 45 minutes.  Finally realized it was 7:00 and still didn't have our food.  Asked our server about the delay and she seemed shocked.  To top it off she had the nerve to say I brought you some bread, your salad and wine...WHAT!!!  We told her never mind on the food we would just take our bill.  By now it's 7:05.  The manager comes to the table to tell us that our food is being plated right now so it's ready.  At this point the show was starting in 20 minutes so we clearly didn't have time to eat it now.  She was very unapologetic about the whole situation.  She brought us our bill, and clearly couldn't be bothered to comp anything from it to try and rectify the situation.  Then the server comes back again to tell us our food is done now and did we want to take it was us.  Why yes, I would love to take my food and leave it in the car for the next 2.5 hours while we attend the concert.  That sounds like a great plan...NOT.   The couple that was seated right before us had also complained to their server and manager about the wait and I overheard their server mention that is was because there were so many people here tonight...keep in mind I mentioned the place was barely half full.  That was their 3rd time coming to the restaurant and it was the same all 3 times.  They were really trying to give the place a chance but said 3 strikes and you are out.  Such a disappointment and unlike the other couple, we will not give them another chance.  When you have people complaining you have to make it right and they did NOTHING!!! Do not waste your time going here unless you have tons of time to kill.  Luckily the show at the theater was amazing so it didn't ruin my night since we had to go to the show on an empty stomach."}
{"text":"We had a small taste and were coming back for more.  We stopped by for dinner before a show at the Mesa Arts Center.  Just a short walk from the theater.  Il Vinaio was busy but the wait staff were kind enough to let us know what we might be able to get and still have time to walk back to theater.  The restaurant seems to be a great gathering place.  Lots of large parties having a good time.  We ordered the the Vinaio Bruschetta and a Four Cheese Flatbread because of our time crunch.  The Bruschetta was a great combination with pesto, goat cheese, caramelized figs, and candied pecans; and the Flatbread was melty fontina, pepper jack, cheddar, and feta cheeses.  Turned out this was a perfect light dinner before the show.  We shared our choices.  My wife and I loved the favors of sweet figs with the goat cheese. We had a great time.  Cindy our server was really attentive and wanted to make sure we got to the show on time.  Her suggested items were excellent.  We are making plans to come back again soon to have a full dinner experience."}
{"text":"We have belonged to the Il Vinaio wine club for quite a few years.  We love getting a new selection of wine every month at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite restaurants for food and happy hour, today they had brunch too! Seriously! They have salads and yummy light food so don't let the name make you think heavy Italian! It just great food and wine! I don't know why they aren't packed all the time.. Ok I said enough. Price is good too!"}
{"text":"Amazing Happy Hour! Great drinks and specials, everything tastes great. Love that you can sit on couches."}
{"text":"My family had an excellent dinner experience here before a show at the Mesa Arts Center. The service was a little slow but the food and atmosphere are exceptional, especially since fine dining restaurants in Mesa are so limited."}
{"text":"We dined at Il Vinaio on Saturday night. Got there early before the Chris Botti Concert at Mesa Arts Center. It was our first time at the restaurant. It is a pleasant place inside and out. We were greeted when we arrived and seated in the dining room. They do have a small bar that looks nice. Our server brought us a terrific bottle of Byron Chardonnay from Santa Barbara County in California. It was excellent and priced right. We paired the wine with a cheese plate that hit the spot. We also had green salads and pasta with meat sauce. The meat sauce was meaty but not a nice thick tomato sauce that we like. We both agreed it was too \"watery\" for our taste and that we would try something else next time. As they served rolls with the pasta that we good but not great. However, we had a great night and walked the three blocks to the Mesa Arts Center. It was a great evening, we will certainly be back."}
{"text":"this is the second time there and both times have been great! We tried their brunch out and it was great! I had the crepes ( really really thin pancakes) and my wife had some eggs bacon and potatoes. I really like the fact that the owners are there and so involved and they chat with you and remember you. Great food good times just go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Food and service were mediocre. Nothing special in my opinion, not for that price. Had the tilapia the first time and it was very fishy tasting, which was not what I expected. Second time had the lobster Mac and cheese which was alright but not amazing. Boyfriend had the 10oz sirloin and the chicken a different time, which he said were good, so maybe it's just the fish that they serve there that's yucky."}
{"text":"Food was AWFUL. Everything had a weird flavor and there was another table saying the same thing near us. We mentioned it to our server but he said that was the way it was suppose to taste. Waste of $85."}
{"text":"Amazing food and very nice staff and owners. It was my girlfriends birthday and they took very good care of us! I also proposed which they celebrated with us. Awesome place for the gluten intolerant folk. Full gluten free menu along with their regular menu. Very food allergy conscious and will do anything to please. Will defiantly become regulars and thank you again for a an amazing night that we will never forget!"}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant with a party of friends. Things were going well until my friend had a severe allergic reaction after taking one bite of her food. Turns out, there was cross contamination by way of the convection oven. Well, the manager never even apologized to her and they still charged her for the wine! They also made no effort to make sure she was okay despite being violently ill in the bathroom. Extremely poor customer service and there are health risks at this restaurant. None of my friends will be returning."}
{"text":"Phenom Food & Sweet Vibes + Outstanding Pro Service = il Vinaio ! Spectacular Weds. Live Music is the Perfect Happy Hour. Don't miss Paris James for some of the best Blues & Old School R&B from Otis Redding  to Stevie Ray Vaughan. For Wonderful / Unpretentious Fun visit this Place !"}
{"text":"We came in on a Sunday evening over a holiday weekend. When we arrived, we were one of three tables, but by the time our food arrived we were the only table in the restaurant. Despite having many tables open, the waiter seated us at a 2-top. Odd, but whatever. A nearby waitress cleaned the table behind us, a 4-top, and offered it to us to have a little more room which we were grateful for. When our waiter brought our water, he simply said he'd give us time with the menu, never asked us if we wanted to order anything to drink (we didn't order the water, he just said he'd bring some). Eventually he returned to our table and we ordered our meals, pork loin and lobster mac and cheese. Waiter asked if we would like bread, but again didn't ask about drinks. When the bread arrived it was a selection of 3 rolls, very hot. They were tasty, and the front of the menu noted they were from a local bakery. Our food arrived surprisingly quickly and was extremely hot. The \"lobster\" mac and cheese was more like a side dish and topped with a seafood combination of imitation crabmeat, a few bay scallops, and maybe a piece or two of crawfish. I was honestly expecting \"Langostino\" lobster aka crawfish but the imitation crabmeat was just sad. The cheese sauce was grainy and not very flavorful, also oddly spicy which wasn't noted in the menu. My husband's pork was a generous portion although the risotto was gummy and glue-like with the insane amount of cheese that had been added. Our waiter checked on us once at the beginning of the meal, but never returned to refill our water glasses, instead posting up at the bar to chat with the bartender and other servers. For what we received, it was incredibly overpriced, especially the mac and cheese, and I would have left hungry had it not been for the two extra rolls I ate. The only positives I can say is the bread is good and the food arrived fast, although in reality it arrived way too fast for it to have actually been prepared in the kitchen and not just reheated. Would not recommend, nor would we return."}
{"text":"Il Vinaio you are truly beyond fabulous! i have been wooed with delicious filet mignon before but yours is to die for.  The filet was served with divine mashed potatoes and quite possible the best brussel sprouts I've ever had. I've dined on this meal before and each time, I'm struck at how amazing Chef James is.   Though each meal I've had at Il Vinaio has been fantastic, this one was different. I brought family and friends and wanted to have them enjoy Il Vinaio as if it was my own home and they did.   The wonderful host and hostess,Camerin and Cindy, made sure that my friends and family enjoyed the same amazing food and hospitality I have. Amazing food is expected but wonderful hospitality is an art that not all restaurants can claim. Il Vinaio certaintly can.   Now, Il Vinaio may not hit a home run with every meal, every time but I have continued to go back to them again and again, for happy hour, for wine tastings, for New Years and celebrations and here is the thing - the patience and investment I have made in this restaurant has paid off.    The return on my patience and investment is more than a few mouthfuls of food that instantaneously brings a crazy smile to my face and makes me smiles days later and thank the heavens for Chef James.  The best part is that they treat me, and they will treat you, like family. It is an experience not to be missed."}
{"text":"We wanted to try the 4 course meal for $75 as advertised on livingsocial.com I will comment on each course.  menu  Salad  Two Field Greens Salads  Toad Hollow Rose Pinot Noir  Salad was fine. A lot of green olives. Wine tasted like zinfandel and neither of us liked it. Rolls were good.   Appetizer  Portabella Oscar: Crab-Stuffed Mushroom with Asparagus and Hollandaise  Steelhead Pinot Noir  Very bland. 3/10. Hollandaise sauce was thin and uneventful. Now we are getting worried. Was not hot but served room temp. We had to force ourselves to eat this course. Disappointing. Wine was still just ok.   Entrée  6-Ounce Filet Mignon with Red Skin Mashed Potatoes, Haricots Verts, and Wild Mushroom Demi  OR  Lobster Scallop Napoleon with Bacon Risotto Cake, Asparagus, Sun Dried Tomato Butter, and Lemon Beurre Blanc  Cosentino \"The Cab\" Cabernet Sauvignon  We tried one of each. The Lobster dish was what made us try this 4-course meal. This was just bad. Risotto was harad and not fully cooked. The owner Cindi explained to us that it was intentionally \"al dente\". Why? Worst risotto ever. No flavoring. We exchanged it for another fillet which was good.    Dessert  Gelato Sampler Trio  Tombstone Belle Port  Gelato was ok. We liked the Port and the macaroons Did not like the music that was playing--bad 80's music some of the time. classical would have been nice.  Summary: They tried and multiple courses was fun but we did not feel the food was of the caliber that it was worth $95 with tax and tip and we won't be back."}
{"text":"I come here often and have tried various foods and desserts and always love them. I have even had an antelope burger and kangaroo brats here. When they have something new or limited it's always a tasty treat. They also have a nice rotating beer selection. I really love the beer and donut pairings that they do. And the owners and staff are so friendly and welcoming, I feel more like I am going to visit friends or family and I can relax rather than going to a loud, stuffy restaurant (as I feel about many other places).  PS: Love the tables with a couch on one side. I mean, if that's not relaxing..."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in downtown Mesa. Tried it for the first time tonight, came for the wine bar.  We enjoyed the great selection of wine, I had three different reds that were all very good (I recommend the Smith and hook blend!).  But better yet the food we had was so good!  They had a flatbread filet and blue was awesome, and the Vinaio bruschetta was amazing.  Best yet the people taking care of us were awesome, friendly and attentive.  For a nice evening out, give this place a shot, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with a friend to have a meal before seeing a play at the Mesa Arts Center. For those of you who like to use the light rail, this is one of the places that you can get to easily now that the rail goes through downtown Mesa. The restaurant is in a building that was obviously something else before but they have made the interior their own. I'm not much of a wine drinker but a nice selection of beers and all the beers on draft are $5 - a more than reasonable price for a craft brew and the management, when I ordered an IPA, even brought me a sample of the local IPA from the brewery down the street, Desert Eagle Brewery.   My friend had the pork cutlet over a risotto and I had something else which does not seem to be on the online menu, but it was also good. I found this to be a perfect place to relax and enjoy some nice food and a drink or two before an event at the Mesa Arts Center and I'm sure it will be where I go again next time I go to a show."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place isn't busier. The only time we've seen it full is on the beer & donut tasting days (those are FUN). The food is good, fresh & innovative. The service is always fast & friendly. Of course, they always have plenty of good options for booze - especially wine. And it's decorated in fresh, inviting decor. I've been here for lunch, dinner & happy hour & it's very consistent."}
{"text":"The brunch for my mother's 94th birthday with 15 adults, 8 children was perfect. The staff was so hospitable and responsive. The food was delicious and not the ordinary run of the mill menu. A children's menu was greatly appreciated and it was fun to have our own private area. Reasonably priced, this place is a gem in downtown Mesa. For large groups or small (or just coming in for wine tasting), enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very pricey, our meal was average they were not kid friendly and I will not be returning.  I gave them 2 stars because the pancakes were good."}
{"text":"Thank goodness that the owners decided to revive this beautiful downtown location and turn it into a far better restaurant than the old cafeteria that used this building before.  Il Vinaio is a welcome addition to downtown Mesa. I've visited about a dozen times for breakfast and will continue to be a regular. I haven't had lunch or dinner there yet, but I suspect that the food and service would be consistent with their top-notch breakfast.  The staff is friendly and attentive. After a few visits, it was clear that they recognized us and gave us even warmer welcomes. It seems like they genuinely enjoy their jobs.  I've had the crepes with blueberries and marscapone (only $6 - take that, Crackers) a couple of times. The fruit is fresh and the crepes are perfectly cooked. It's sweet but wonderfully executed.  Lately I've stuck with eggs for breakfast - either the $5 breakfast sandwich on an English muffin with a generous portion of potatoes, or two eggs (I take mine poached, which they do in the traditional style, so no added fat) with potatoes and sausage for about $7. I'm not a fan of potatoes, but I love what they do with them for breakfast. They are oven roasted, slightly crispy, with roasted and almost caramelized onions. The taste is fantastic.  I do have a couple of complaints that I hope the owners will work on: 1) Buy some good (hot) tea options. You are a nice restaurant and should have something other than Lipton plain black. Invest in a variety pack with herbal and green teas, plus Earl Grey. 2) Replace your ceiling vents. They're disturbingly unattractive."}
{"text":"Was in town on business and wanted a good restaurant nearby where I could sit a bar for dinner. Cindy was the bartender and was super helpful and knowledgeable. I had humus for an app (with hot pita points) and salmon. Also had a nice Chardonnay. All recommended by Cindy. Great food, wine and service."}
{"text":"I was looking for a nice gluten-free restaurant close to Mesa and Il Vinaio popped up. It was my boyfriend's birthday and he has celiac so I had to be pretty picky about finding a place. I read the reviews on here about how conscious the staff is about their gluten-free dishes and knew we had to try it. Our server was very friendly and we were seated immediately. The place itself was very clean and inviting. It looked like it was a remodeled church (could just be the stained glass windows that gave me that feel). The place was not very busy, but we arrived at around 5:00pm and people began to trickle in after us.   We both ordered a beer. My boyfriend ordered one of their gluten free selections while I asked for a hefeweizen (which they did not have so they suggested another beer on tap). We both LOVED our beers. I wish I could remember the name of mine because I would drink it regularly.  The food was just as exceptional as the drinks. We ordered two appetizers of gluten-free bruschetta (one regular and one Vinaio). I HIGHLY recommend the Vinaio bruschetta. It has pesto, goat cheese, caramelized figs, and candied pecans. YUMMY! The sweetness was great with the saltiness of the pesto and beer! My boyfriend ordered the Antelope Burger while I ordered the Lobster mac & cheese because when you see those on the menu, you kind of HAVE to order them, right? We both loved our entrees! Astounding service and remarkable food in the convenient setting of downtown Mesa!  Celiac and gluten allergy sufferers rejoice! Il Vinaio will do you right!"}
{"text":"I was taken to this \"restaurant\" for a birthday lunch. Seated immediately but told that there would be a wait. So we waited . . . no bread was brought to the table to tide us over during our wait or even offered. I understand that sometimes a larger table should take priority BUT every customer should be treated with respect and taken care of equally. I ordered the blueberry crepes and a side of bacon. The crepes were mediocre at best tasting a bit off. The side was soggy and chewy four slices of something that resembled bacon. My companion ordered the V Ruben which arrived with cole slaw inside the sandwich, gasp, bastardization of cuisine. And when asked the waitress had no idea whether the pastrami was lean or fatty. What gives?! And no spicy mustard. The bathroom was a door leading into tiny sink area and another door leading into the lavatories. A fresh coat of paint was merely window dressing on this poor excuse for an upscale restaurant in downtown Mesa."}
{"text":"Always a reliable place for a relaxing glass of wine, appetizer or to enjoy one of their fabulous entrees."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, as a huge fan of wine bars and Mediterranean cuisine, but I found the experience disappointing due to issues with three different ingredients in the meal being either rancid or overripe, and more particularly due to the poor attitude of the manager on duty (who told me that I was just my opinion that the ingredients were inedible. The existence of mildew on dried figs or big brown spots on fresh strawberries  is factual, not subjective). I would not return here, due to being treated rudely and arrogantly by the manager. Too bad because the restaurant has an inviting food menu and a good selection of wines by the glass. I also appreciated the attentive service by the server."}
{"text":"We went back to this gem last evening with a discount voucher in hand. I love this place. The food and service are impeccable. Still a bit pricey, but so worth it. Do yourself a favor and give it a shot. On Main Street just east of Country Club Drive."}
{"text":"What a great joint to meet friends and enjoys glass of 'old grape juice '  The tri-hummus is to die for, and then order up the piled high with pastrami club on marbled rye!....yummmmm!"}
{"text":"So wanted to like this place, the interior is adorable!  If you're going for just a glass of wine, then definitely visit this place.  But, if you want food, don't.   And stay away from the ladies bathroom,  there is such a strong odor of raw sewage that a couple of us were nauseated by it.  Now to the food, we went for Sunday brunch.  One person ordered the crepes with blueberries and it looked like the cook just dumped a small half frozen bag of blueberries on top.  Half of it was the thawed ice.  It should have been called Drowned purple water Crepes. YUCK  Just no excuse this time of year not to use fresh blueberries.  Another person had moldy tasting rosemary on their potatoes and the other person that ordered the breakfast potatoes had hers come out bone dry and no seasoning at all.  As for me, i ordered the lobster eggs Benedict which came out with no eggs, how does both chef and waiter miss that?!  Hello, quality control, anyone home?  By the time mine came back with basically two hard boiled eggs on top, everyone else had finished.  The waiter tells me that they decided not to charge me for the bacon side, well I wouldn't charge for two black charred pieces of bacon either!  They should have done more for the orders that were so bad.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends on a Saturday afternoon. It was really quiet; I assume due to the holiday weekend.   I must admit, I was worried when I saw the exterior, but the inside was a nice surprise. Cindy was our server. She was great!  We ordered the Lobster Benedict and a the Green Chili \"burger\"; but at Cindy's suggestion changed out the beef for chicken. The lobster was tender, quite a lot of it, the eggs cooked perfectly, the green chili added a very nice flavor and the hollandaise was great...very rich! The chicken \"burger\" was incredible. Everything was very tasty...but best of all? $8 bottomless champagne!  We will definitely be back for dinner!"}
{"text":"Went with my husband and another couple to a beer and donut pairing event here and had a truly enjoyable experience.  I mean how many places do donut and beer pairings?!  It was quite yummy.  They often have live music which is another bonus- but it's not so loud you can't enjoy conversation with the person next to you.  I don't really understand the negative reviews regarding this place."}
{"text":"This used to be the Mesa Eatery and was dying a slow death. The new owners have turned it around 100%.   I have only had breakfast here, which has improved a little. The prices are still astonishingly low, and the service is reasonable (really depends on how busy they are). The atmosphere in here is fantastic - they gutted and rebuilt this place. It no longer looks like a rundown 1950's Big Boy and now resembles a chic wine bar. Have you ever had breakfast on a couch? They still need to update the bathrooms, but I can live with them just being clean.  Try this for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews, looked at the pictures, but still did not expect the dining experience I had at Il Vinaio.  The atmosphere was very lively, with several different guys getting up to sing and a live band playing some Italian tunes. We started out with the share platter, which was a great starter. The veggies and soppressata all seemed fresh, and with a glass of wine could probably satisfy the needs of a couple light eaters.  For our entree we chose the rigatoni with tenderloin tips and the braised pork shank.  It has been a long time since I had a pork shank, but I don't recall it being as tender and juicy as this one.  Rigatoni was excellent as well.  There wasn't one thing on either of our plates that I would have given under 4 stars.  Couple that with great service and a fun atmosphere, and Il Vinaio has given me a good reason to occasionally visit Mesa."}
{"text":"Not from this area we relied on Yelp reviews to pick a restaurant before our show at Mesa Arts Center on a Friday night. This place was super close and had great reviews.  Positives:  Beer selection (had the gluten-free Stone beer, which was very good) and gluten-free food options.  Green hatch chile hummus was delicious. If you order nothing else get this!  Happy hour is available at your table (not just at the bar) They take reservations  The front of the menu has info about Slow Food (which if you are not familiar is a movement about eating local, sustainable foods). I am all for eating local and sustainable, however it seemed more like it was about serving slow food as we waited a very long time to put in drink orders, then appetizers and then finally food. Our waitress was very hard to track down even though the place was busy but not packed.  The reason for three stars is the food was really just average, nothing blew us away (we were a party of 6) and especially for the price. Two people at our table ordered the Mahi-Mahi and everyone agreed the mango rice wasn't good. The veggies with pasta were just ok. The only stand out was the lobster mac and cheese."}
{"text":"3 stars it is not. It wasn't good, it wasn't bad. That's the point and too bad since their menu looks so good. It reminded us of when we went to a specific italian chain locaiton when they first opened up and everything was so bland. We asked what was up and they replied if you want it like all others in the chain you need to ask for full flavor. Even though this was in an area which had a lot of older clientele they should not have strayed from their standard prep. Could that be the problem here? This food could be really good if there was some/any actual flavor. Not being a chain you should strive to break the rules in a good way. The reception and wait staff helped to raise rating from a 1 to 2 stars."}
{"text":"This is one of those special cases where atmosphere, service, food quality/taste and price all blend to create a wonderful 5!  From entering to leaving it was a great experience.  We ordered the Hummus Trio - a great starter.  My friend received an excellent wine recommendation and she loved her blackened Tilapia (I tasted and agree).  I can't wait to return to have the prime pork loin again!  It was suggested that I cut the capers into thirds and include in each bite - this was perfect for flavor.  This was a great meal.  The owners Cam and Cindy were on hand to provide input and history which was a huge plus - its very apparent that a customers comfort are important to them, it showed.  I highly recommend you visit!  If I lived in the area I would be a regular."}
{"text":"You know when you go to your best married friends' house and you leave well fed and a little buzzed on excellent wine? Come here ro get that level of camaraderie and deliciousness. I live in Tucson but this place will be a destination for me. ."}
{"text":"I am not surprised at the number of low star reviews this place has...that said I love it here. I want to check out a dinner but have only been here for Sunday Brunch. The service is slow to get the food out and or take orders. The last two times we have been there we have spent 3 hours for brunch. I can see how this irritates people.  I can tell you however, that we go there knowing that. It is an excellent time for our group of friends to catch up and hang out.  The prices are so affordable, most of the food has been delightful (skip the crepes), and the bottom less champage is a big bonus if it will take at least a couple of hours to eat drink and be merry.  Now don't take me word for it - go ahead and listen to all of the one and two star reviews and stay away... then I still won't have a wait while I get there. I love being seated right away!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? The great food? great atmosphere? or the awesome staff? Wow what a great restaurant. I was greeted by both of the owners, a husband and wife team that really want you to feel at home yet still be in a very special atmosphere they have created with class and restraint,  The wait staff was attentive with a flair of whimsical personality splashed were appropriate. (you have to coax them a little!) The mood was set by a guitarist/soloist that reminded me of Carlos Santana unplugged. My beer and cheese fondue with homemade warm pretzels is to die for...only to be topped by the best salmon i have ever eaten...pecan encrusted salmo finished with an orange gastrique sauce on a bed of al dente asparagus nestled into a warm pillow of green chili mashed potatoes which are addicting. OK I'll stop...but you have to go here...the menu is deep, well thought out and expertly executed. You will not be disappointed but rather quietly impressed and satisfied...head, heart and tummy!"}
{"text":"I have hosted lunches here for The Conscious Community for the past year and Cindy, the owner and the wait staff have always done an excellent job catering to our needs. The food is fresh and yummy. They offer gluten free items that are incredible. I also went to dinner there one night when I was on the East side of town and was amazed at the gourmet offerings, paired with a great wine list. Cindy and her husband make you feel welcome. You'll be glad you tried it!"}
{"text":"This has long been our \"Go To\" place for a variety of themes - date night, happy hour, birthday, anniversary, or visiting family or friends. Owners are as engaging as they are knowledgeable about the food and drink that they serve. No skimping on ingredients or on service, and the setting is perfect - classy without being pretentious. Cheers!"}
{"text":"The food and prices are amazing! The service was great, we had a group staying in the hotel next door and had about 30 person party roll in for brunch. They made everyone feel comfortable and welcomed. It didn't take long for the food to come out and I can't wait to eat here again.  This place is Canyon State Beard Club approved!"}
{"text":"Tried a new place in Mesa as it was close to the Mesa Art Theatre to see the show \"Chicago\".  Tom, our server was pleasant and efficient.    Went for Happy Hour and ordered every appetizer on the HH menu and enjoyed a glass of wine while dining.   All of the apps were delicious.  Chicken croquettes a little on the spicy side but very good.  Deviled eggs were creamy.  Flatbread pizzas were flavorful as was the hummus.    Enjoyed the spinach and the Cesear salads which were fresh.   Also Ordered a burger which was huge! Topped it all off with the gelato trio which completed our meal! Highly recommend enjoying your evening here"}
{"text":"We came here prior to a show at the Mesa Arts Center. Not a lot of choices in the immediate area and this one was the wrong choice. I ordered the sirloin steak and potato. I asked for medium and it came well done and dry. Not impressed. The potato was twice baked covered with cheese and was ok. My companion said her salmon was good and tasty. Not an experience I want to repeat."}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere were nice but the food was not great. We tried four items off the happy hour menu and they were all generic and too heavy on the sauces/dressing/drizzles. I didn't finish any of them."}
{"text":"I had just a few hours to spend in Mesa, and had quite a few dinner options to explore but something about the exterior of this place seemed welcoming yet upscale. Jason greeted me warmly and answered a few questions about the menu (I'm vegetarian), and everything he suggested sounded great! The restaurant was quiet and comfortable. The food was fresh, ample, and delicious. The recommended wine was perfect. The service was quick, thorough, attentive. I couldn't be happier about the restaurant experience. As a solo diner, I especially appreciated the easy and interesting conversation with Jason. He's not only a great employee but an exceptional young man. Some restaurants make solo customers uncomfortable, but here, everyone was great. If I lived in Mesa, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"Eating breakfast here regularly now, love it.  To all you haters who have NEVER EVEN BEEN HERE who are writing 1-star reviews, over the lion burger controversy - shame on you!  So you don't like the lion meat thing - I get that.  Have at it in the discussion topic here.  But if you haven't eaten here, DON'T POST A BOGUS REVIEW just for the sake of giving the joint 1 star and attempting to drag their average down.  That's BS, and you're a lousy Yelper if you're doing this."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place because I think it has potential, and because I think heavy meat-eaters might like it. I'll start with the good stuff to counter my low stars . . .  The place is big with a large airy open space in the middle. They have live music on some nights and the space would be good for dancing, though I didn't get the feeling that dancing will be happening here -- maybe I'm wrong? The music that was playing while I was there was definitely not conducive to dancing -- VERY subdued, not that great.   There are separate (but fairly open) large areas at the sides and backs of the restaurant. These are great spaces for large parties.  The service was good, the meat-eaters in my group liked the meat (I'm vegan), and the owners spent a nice amount of time chatting with us and answering our questions. They're really trying to do something unique and serve high-quality food. They get their produce from a local farm -- One Windmill Farms -- which is awesome.  But that's the weird part -- I buy my own produce from that same farm, so I was really surprised to find that the vegetarian food my husband and I ordered was really bland. I don't know if it's the way they prepared the food, or if the produce they got that day just happened to be flavorless, but I have no interest in going back to find out.  So what did I get? The Angel Hair Pasta and the Bruscetta. It was the most bland pasta dish I've ever eaten. The bruscetta wasn't 100% flavorless -- it was drowning in garlic. I normally love a lot of garlic, but this was definitely overkill, and the tomato and basil were flavorless, just like on the pasta. The bread was too soggy for me, too, but my husband liked it.  There is an impression that Il Vinaio is a wine bar. It's not. Go to D'Vine if you want a Wine Bar. The wine list at Il Vinaio is limited. I had the Malbec and found it no better quality than any Malbec I can get at a typical restaurant -- just o.k.   Overall, it was the most flavorless food I can remember getting at a restaurant, but it was priced high.    BTW, there isn't much for a vegetarian to eat here. That didn't affect my star rating, but since I yelp for vegetarians, I wanted to mention it."}
{"text":"So ... I came back again...just feels like home... I aways like what I drink ..always like what I eat...taking a chance tonight ..gonna get a steak rare ( raw)... Hopefully no rating changes. If you don't see an update 5 stars stays"}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for happy hour for the first time. I really liked it! Server was very nice. $5 happy hour tapas were yummy. Plus you get $2 off glasses of wine. I thought it was really cute inside. It used to be a family restaurant so there is only so much they can change. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Unimpressive and overpriced. Tried the lamb ragu and it was one of the blandest dishes I've ever eaten. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the dominant flavor was the noodles! We tried an appetizer that was okay but nothing special (some sort of spicy/sweet shrimp). The best part of the meal was the bread (Breadsmith), however we had to ask for it and it didn't arrive until we were almost done with the meal.  On the plus side, they had a good beer selection featuring some local breweries that you don't see all the time. I do like that they source most of their ingredients locally."}
{"text":"Service very good, wines are good, food just so-so.  I had a filet that was not a filet...it was OK but I don't know what cut it really was.  Companion had Pasta Florentine with just a hint of spinach.  Def for drinks but may pass on the food next time."}
{"text":"Yummy food. Great service. This was our first visit. Almost didn't stop cause of the 3 1/2 star review. Thought what the heck. So glad we did. We will be back. Definitely try the fried pork lion."}
