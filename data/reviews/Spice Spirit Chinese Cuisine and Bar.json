{"text":"First time in town and a friend took me to this place. Amazing food and spectacular environment especially traditional Chinese decoration. A great place worth trying !"}
{"text":"I usually go to Mekong Restaurant at Mekong Plaza for Chinese cuisine whenever I am in the area. The other night, I tried Spice because they just recently opened. I should have figured out by the name that they will have mostly spicy foods. But since we are already seated, why not give it a try, right?

Before we get to the food, I want to note that the ambiance is very nice.  They get 5 star for that.

Since I don't do well with spicy food, I ordered chicken fried rice, Mongolian beef, and west lake soup. I was disappointed that the the west lake soup did not have cilantro. The Mongolian beef is ok (I had better), and the fried rice is on the oily/salty side.

There were a lot of dinners eating and they ordered spicy items from the menu. They even had hot pots and soups and they seemed to be enjoying it. I don't wish to bring down Spice' rating, but I guess this restaurant is not for me. I wish them the best."}
{"text":"What a fucking bad Chinese restaruant. We waited about half an hour?and  the servise is too low.  It is no servise."}
{"text":"I was wary because of the prices we had seen in the online menu, but are always looking for good Chinese food, it's on the way to Mekong Market, so we stopped in for lunch.  We ordered Spicy Lamb ($18.95), which the waiter said was plenty for two and they could tone it down for my wife.  Later the bill showed \"small spice\" or something to that effect, but the plate was full of peppers, hard to even find the lamb.  The lamb was so fatty that my stomach was a little upset afterwards, although I almost finished it and it's a dish for one, not two (which would be the only way to justify the price).  We also had a vegetable dish of eggplant ($10.95).  It was mushy and the sauce was nondescript and we left most of it on the plate.  My grandson was with us and his Mongolian Beef ($14.95) was decent.  The service was good except for the misordered spice level, which meant my wife couldn't eat much.  The decor is nice, but they played American radio which seemed out of place.  The bottom line is that the food is very overpriced and you're taking your chances with quality.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I enjoy this restaurant almost three times a week. I really like spicy foods and the foods are delicious. Also, the servers are so nice. My recommendation are Jumbo shrimp with salted egg paste, fragrance lamb chops, Dan Dan noodle, Extremely spicy Feng teng fish. All in all, this one is the best Chinese restaurant I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"I have been in Arizona for four years, this is the best Chinese restaurant that I ever taste. BTW I am from China.

The traditional and authenticate chinese food! 
Wonderfully!"}
{"text":"The real deal Chinese food, which is hard to find here in AZ. Very fancy interior, more of an upscale fine dining establishment.

Food was excellent and very spicy."}
{"text":"Authentic dishes, all about the clean flavors and spices, not heavy sugary pastes.  House chicken three chilis is phenomenal.  A bit expensive for lunch, portions are probably same for lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese cuisine. Pleasant environment and nice staff. I was surprised to find such amazing traditional Chinese food in a place like Phoenix especially when I tried many Chinese restaurants in San Francisco back then, but didn't find one like this. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Decided to try a new restaurant, the food was delicious! Definitely authentic and made with care to tradition and flavor! I really love spicy food amd this really made my palette so happy! Absolutely will be back! 

The service was also great! Very attentive without being pestering you, and really allowing you to enjoy your meal!

Genuinely recommend."}

{"text":"Finally.....found a outstanding Authentic Szechwan cuisine in the east valley!
Service is great,staff are helpful.
We were guided to our seats in about 30 seconds of waiting.
As we are really familiar with Szechwan cuisine,it didn't take us too long to deiced what to order. We ordered #240????(Sliced Beef & Maw Szechwan style) #102 ????(Fragrance Lamb Chop) #251?????(String Beans).It's more than enough for two...even my wifey still want to order boiled whole fish.We will leave it for next time I guess.
Food were served faster than we expected, also being presenting nice and clean.Taste even better....
Well worth my money and time! We will visit this place again soon!"}
{"text":"The food was really tasty and authentic?but the price could be more reasonable. It is too expensive for me to visit it often! Lower the price down could bring you more customers!"}
{"text":"Bad service, super slow and they charge extra if you pay with credit card??!! Never heard that before. Will never go there again"}
{"text":"Really good food, especially if you enjoy spicy foods. Our waiter Ed is awesome and the service is amazing."}
{"text":"Super delicious  Spicy Chinese Food. Lots of vegetarian choices as well. Perfect date spot, it's not very crowded yet so come before everyone finds out how great this place is!"}
{"text":"I don't really know anything about Chinese cuisine, however I thought this place was the real deal!  Well thought out interior, great open dining space. Our service by Eddie was terrific.  Eddie was kind enough to make several recommendations. The house three chili chicken was spectacular and they give you plenty of it to share.  I tried pork belly for the first time and while it was not my favorite dish it had a good flavor balanced with sweet veggies. They have  both an authentic Chinese menu and a Americanized Chinese menu with many options for picky eaters and children.  We will definitely go back in the future."}
{"text":"If you want to try some extremely spicy Chinese food, this is the place to go. But if you do not aim for extreme spicy, but well-cooked delicious spicy food, this place is just so-so. Went there twice and felt like we could find better alternatives at other Szechuan style restaurants, and in some cases my cooking could be better (to be fair, I consider myself good at cooking)."}
{"text":"They don't serve lots of things that are in the menu. We were disappointed that all the dishes we want were \"out\". We went there twice and both times they said they were \"out\" of those food. So then we ordered lettuce wrap but they served us the meat without the lettuce. We had to pay for the full price. The food was not so impressive either. In overall it's a poor quality resturant."}
{"text":"Authentic Sichuan style restaurant in Phx!
A little pricy but food's good and spicy!
Will come back"}
{"text":"This place has real Chinese cuisine! Very neat interior! Would definitely come back next time in town"}
{"text":"Waited for 10 minutes for a hostess to show up for seating, finally the party that came in afterwards went hunting for somebody. Seated at a table and waited another 20 minutes. When no one came to take our order we finally left. Greeted on the way out I asked if the service was always this slow (it was Tuesday) she simply replied \"I am the owner.\""}
{"text":"Very authentic sichuan food. This is a Chinese chain company. Best in Phoenix. I like the decoration of the place, it is not like other to go places, this is a nice dinner place."}
{"text":"I would love to rave out this place. I have been waiting to try since it started to build over a yr ago. 

When i approached the restaurant
I noticed all the staff outside smoking. Once inside i was alerted that they were the ones also handling the food. Everyone reeked of cigg smoke. 

I order kung pow chicken and wasn't pleased. It wasn't kung pow chicken. The sauce was not correct nor were the ingredients. 

Everyone working there seemed confused and lost."}
{"text":"\"Hot\" and new is so appropriate for this place! Great food, very spicy. It just needs better music...you listen to commercials for half your mean."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Chinese restaurant Szechuan style in Phoenix area!!! First view is a nice quire environment and Eddie come to  serves the table for couple simple question and we start to order. I had House chicken with three chilis and Mapo tofu. It is great flavor and makes me thought the same flavor as when I was in Chengdu. I mean if you are really wants to eat some traditional Chinese food and Szechuan style. You should have a try!!!"}
{"text":"Very bad service. Totally keeping silent except asking us what we would like to order. Dishes are really BAD, being a chinese, this is a disaster for me."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Chinese food. The service is a little hard to communicate with as English is not their first language. Overall the food was made very good and tasted great. The dumplings are unique as they're immersed in a spicy chilly oil. The water boiled fish wss a very standard dish, nothing spectacular, but on par with what I'd expect. The three spice chicken was really really good, I've never had anything like it before but I loved it. The eggplant was pretty standard, as expected. Definitely worth a try for Chinese in Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Get into the spicy spirit! There are quite a few Sichuan style Chinese restaurants opening up in the Phoenix area. I say bring on the heat! 

Set in the corner spot of the same plaza Asian Cafe Express is in (But on the opposite side), Spice Spirit opened up just a few weeks ago. I'm not sure what the space used to be but the interior is quite lavish and beautiful, with a lot of tables and booths. I'm sure they spent a pretty penny on upgrading this area to make it look so nice.

We decided on the hot and spicy cumin fish fillet, dan dan noodles and the chef's special dry chili tofu. The fish and tofu were prepared in a similar way, lightly breaded and fried, then coated with a chili mixture. I enjoyed the light crispness of the tofu, the soft molten creamy center, and the tongue numbing chili spice. The fish was tender, also lightly crisp, with a bold punch of ground cumin dusted on it along with the chilis. The dan dan noodles by comparison were more tame. The noodles had an al dente chew to them with a mound of seasoned ground meat and fresh cooked greens. I was surprised to see fresh vegetables instead of the pickled vegetables I usually see in dan dan noodles.

Service was friendly and water was refilled as needed. Prices were a little high but I did feel like the product we got was high quality. 

As we left the owner was there and he thanked us for coming which was a nice touch. 

There's a lot more off the menu I still want to try so I will definitely be back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place...after i was seated and reviewed the menu, the waiter came and asked did I have any questions.  I asked him what veggies were in the Kung Pao Chicken, his response, nothing just chicken, i said okay, i'll take that.  Our comes a dish w/ chicken, onions, various colored bell peppers and peanuts...although this is not what you said it was, i'll still eat it, because it doesn't have anything that i don't like.  It was pretty nasty, tried dressing it up w/ soy sauce and chili oil, it helped slightly, but the chicken had a very odd texture.  The only reason for the two stars is because the waiter was polite.  Needless to say, I will not be back."}
{"text":"New decorations and very nice services. Pretty sipcy though! Ordered the whole fish dish, enough for 4 adults."}
{"text":"We had dinner at this restaurant Saturday night. The food taste good but we wait for almost 1.5 hr. I got my diet cook in a wine cup, which is fine for me....When refill the drink, it was only filed half of the cup... suggest the restaurant provide better training to its servers."}
{"text":"Best traditional spicy Chinese food I have had in Arizona so far!!
The noodles were great! I got the one that's not spicy but my friend had the spicy beef  soup noodle and she loved it, definitely coming back and if you are a spicy food lover, go to this place!
You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese restaurant in Greater Phoenix, but a little bit pricy. Is there any discount for students? By the way, it is funny because someone underrated this restaurant cuz their CHICKEN FRIED RiCE, ORANGE CHICKEN, KUNG PAI CHICKEN were not good at all. Sorry but if you are looking for American style Chinese food, this is definitely not a good place for you."}
{"text":"The food here is super Chinese-styled. The Lalala Ribs pot and toothpicks lamb taste just like what I have eaten back in China. And they have multiple choices of vegetables that are not available at every restaurant. Also I have strong expectation on their upcoming roasted duck!"}
{"text":"Overall: Yum! Love the bbq skewers

Heard their under a new management (again lol) so they have new menus. I dine in once and ordered to go another time. I asked for their phone number but it doesn't seem like they have a phone service set up yet. 

Food: Food here are delicious. I noticed a lot of their food is spicy so keep that in mind. I ordered the pepper and beef rice noodle soup and it was super spicy since it had the Thai chili peppers! It didn't event say it was going to be spicy on the menu. Thankfully, I love spicy. However, their skewers were pretty good but pricey for an order since they come out pretty small. 

Side note: the restaurant seems to be own by Asian owners and workers, seems like they don't understand too much English. I asked how long will it take for my to go order, and they didn't seem to understand."}
{"text":"Ate here on Sept 1 with 8 Mensans and 1 guest.  I was the only \"Chinese\" (ABC).  I ordered to share with 2 others, some of my favorite dishes to order at a Szechuan restaurant:  pork belly with preserved veggies $13.95, hot and spicy fried fish fillet with cumin $16.95, and fried eggplant with ground pork $10.95.  

We were served by Ethan, who gave us 5 star service, which is sadly quite a rare occurance in the Chinese restaurant world.  He kept our water glasses full, he explained the menu, he came back to check on us and ask if everything was OK (really unheard of in my experience at a Chinese restaurant).  He had the attitude of willingness and cheerfulness.  

We rate the taste of the food 4.5 stars.

However, I rate the prices of the dishes 2 stars, so i don't think I will be back anytime too soon, or maybe with a larger group (10) so we can all share food family style, which the Mensans refuse to do."}
