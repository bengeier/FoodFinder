{"text":"Found this place on Yelp's \"Hot and New\" and after going there I know why. The service is great and they are very attentive. I had the gtoza for an appetizer and they were cooked to perfection. I had the steak and salmon for my entre and it was juicy and tender and the salmon was fresh. I highly recommend the garlic butter with the steakt as it tastes incredible. They were nice enough to let us sample the seaweed salad and it was very tender and flavorful. Everything tasted very fresh. For the price, it truly cannot be beat! I will definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Bentos are sooooo good! The sauce's are amazing, ask for spicy sauce and mustard sauce  Kevin is awesome, and so friendly! Definitely will come back again! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this place very friendly owners who went out of their way to make sure I enjoyed my food.  I ordered the rib-eye steak and it was cooked perfectly.  They even show you the steak before they cook it.  Once I got the steak the owners then gave me 5 different kinds of sauce to sample.  It was my first time and whenever I am in town I will be sure to stop in for a great meal.  Only about 15-17 dollars if I remember correctly."}
{"text":"A nice alternative to the sit-down hibachi grills... I don't even really watch the \"show\" that the chefs put on anymore lol.  Kevin gave really good service, always checking on how we were doing and when we asked for some different sauces, they literally brought out every sauce they had  X 2 lol!   Check them out!"}
{"text":"Great little spot. Salmon and shrimp that I had were well cooked. Portions were enough to feel full but not leave you bloated. The variety of different sauces offered really made the difference in flavors you get to taste. Awesome customer service on top of all of that. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Super friendly!!!  their customer service!!! They asked if we needed anything, and made sure we were okay. Their Chicken Katsu was yummy!!! Their salmon and shrimp bento was amazing!!!  definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time.  It is a little hidden gem.  Angis beef was awesome along with the tuna rolls.  Awesome food and awesome service."}
{"text":"Great customer service, very good portions, great quality.  Typically can't get this quality at these prices, especially on the southside.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"New find in town. I'm not too sure when they open but I lived around the area and didn't see it until today. 
Absolutely loved the angus beef with the Scottish Salmon. Everything was seasoned very well and cooked perfectly.
 The fish was not raw but not so over cooked that it falls apart. The steak was cooked medium well per my request but wasn't dry so they definitely nailed it. 
Very happy I found this place and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"FIVE STARS IS NOT ENOUGH FOR THIS ESTABLISHMENT!!!  I and my wife are from MD where Japanese restaurants abound. But we found this on on Yelp and decided to give it a try. Long story short, we've come here almost every day since we've been here in Vegas!  Not only is the food cooked to perfection, the staff really makes you feel like you are not just another tourist. It is evident they love cooking and want you to love eating it and dining with them. PLEASE do yourself a favor and stop by. You will not regret it!!  We will definitely be coming back here when we return later this year!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant took way too long just for 2 bentos and 2 orders of appetizers. If you make plans after getting food from this restaurant, you will be late. The service was unacceptable because we were the only people in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Very friendly service and great prices!! Not to mention the food is AMAZING!! The steak and calamari bento box is delightful!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to write a review for Teppan Bento for a long time. The staff here is always friendly. The gentleman that works the register greets me with a smile and always ask if I've been here before. 

The Angus steak double meat with garlic butter is succulent and savory. I normally ask for my steak to be cooked at medium for melt in yo mouth goodness. Marinated chicken is the wife's fave here. Veggies are good. They tend to go overboard on the onions, but it is a good pairing with the carrots and zucchini. 

Although the meats are cooked to perfection, what makes it over-the-top is the sauces. Make sure you ask for extra teriyaki sauce for the chicken. The mustard sauce and garlic butter compliments the steak well. 

Clearly, these guys don't get a lot of business especially after Fresh and Easy closed next door. I'm sure these guys were getting a lot of their business do to proximity walk ins and convenience. 

You can get a double portion of protein, two cups of rice and veggies for about $11. That's about what you would pay for a three entry at Panda Express. But I'm the kind of dude that doesn't mind paying more for less if the quality is there. Teppan Bento is one of my go to places for a macronutrient friendly meal with phenomenal taste and a decent price."}
{"text":"I was looking for a healthy dinner and stumbled upon this restaurant. It was new and and I was excited to eat a bento, but was sorely disappointed when I got home. I ordered the marinated chicken, the chicken was decent. The fried rice that was pushed on to me without me knowing that it cost $1.90 extra had no clear flavor and was extremely tough to eat (hard) I had to cook new rice at home for myself. I didn't want to finish this dish, but since I have spent so much on it, it would be a waste. Extremely disappointed night ."}
{"text":"Great place to have a quick dinner!  place is small but every one is nice and friendly. I ordered shrimp tempura and steak and shrimp bento, it was delicious! I will go back and try other menus."}
{"text":"Teppan Grill is awesome!  I went in on several occasions to browse their menu.  Kevin and their chef were always so welcoming and offered me samples of all of their sauces.  The first time I ordered, they gave me all of their sauces to take home (since my husband wasn't with me during my previous visits).  My husband was impressed with the taste of all of the sauces. He enjoyed his chicken katsu (crispy, moist and not greasy. My steak was cooked (medium rare) and seasoned perfectly. My 6 year old son devoured his teppanyaki shrimp (he said that it was so good!).  We have been eating there almost once a week; and have never been disappointed.  Great food and great quality at a great price!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time today after seeing all the great reviews. I ordered the marinated chicken and calamari bento combo and it was delicious. The place was clean and everyone was super friendly. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Wonderful! They are always so nice and customize my order for me. Come here for great food! It does take time to cook though so be slightly patient"}
{"text":"This is a diamond in the rough, still needing a lot of polish but full of potential and more importantly, already delicious. The guys running the restaurant are super happy and excited to please. The restaurant is still trying to figure their menu out and doesn't have a lot of sitting area, but there were plenty of free samples so being a sort of \"beta taster\" can have its rewards. :)"}
{"text":"The workers were so friendly and the food tasted really good.  I also really liked the sauces they have and the prices were decent"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place, it's my go-to for a quick an simple meal. Highly recommend the teriyaki chicken and the tempura shrimp not to mention the customer service is second to none. The owner Kevin is awesome he even remembers my name and my favorite thing to order! So next time you're in the mood for Chinese takeout, switch it up and try Kevin's restaurant! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"My wife, our kids and I were STARVING from driving all over trying to find a good place to eat. It took so long because we are total food snobs. We pulled in to this plaza and found this jewel located right by our hotel. The food is loaded with flavor and (steak and shrimp) taste very fresh! The owner is very very hospitable and kind. He was extremely accommodating and friendly. He made it a point to put on a Disney show for our kiddos which was a kind gesture."}
{"text":"Amazing place and family. A must while in LV. Had the tofu and it was perfect even though it was not on the menu.  Very friendly place."}
{"text":"Just try it, you won't regret it!  Garlic butter was money!   They also give you different sauces.  The customer  service was excellent!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty dope. I was looking online for places that sold bento and this place pops up. I go there and the food is amazing. Soft and juicy steak with superb vegetables."}
{"text":"I had the best experience here. My boy ordered steak and chicken,  the steak was so tender and juicy.  The chicken as well. Very friendly staff.  Had met the gentlemen outside and an hour later he still knew my name. I'd give them 10 stars.. all the way around.. GREAT PLACE"}
{"text":"Expensive for the quality of food and service. Take forever to serve the food. Yes it took a long while before the food was served when it wasn't that busy."}
{"text":"I've now been able to try Teppan Bento's food a couple of times and I haven't been disappointed! The steak bento box is probably my favorite so far.   I can't speak for the items I haven't tried yet but I'm sure it's all very good. The food is amazing and the hospitality and customer service is even better.  Kevin is very friendly and always recognizes his regular customers.  If you want a healthier meal, quick service and great customer service, go to Teppan Bento or have it delivered to your home!"}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, great price for the dish!!!   This is a come back place when we come back to Las Vegas. Near the South Premium outlets too!!!!"}
{"text":"Kevin was so wonderful! My girlfriends and I came here on 7/22, first stop on our Bachelorette weekend and had a great experience! The food was delicious and Kevin was very attentive. Would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Came and brought my parents, service was a little rough, but the food was delicious! ESP the garlic butter!!"}
{"text":"This Place is Very welcoming, they will make sure it's how you like it. Affordable Prices. Great selections. Even Better Sauces! I recommend I do."}
{"text":"So ive been going to this place since they opened and I have an amazing experience every time. It's a family owned restaurant and the father and son run all the operations. They are so nice and hospitable. They really go out of the way to make sure you are happy. The food is always delicious. The fried calamari tempura is fried perfectly and never overcooked. I love getting the steak bento, my fav, and the meat is always juicy and cooked to the right temperature (med rare) every time. The veggies are al dente and perfectly seasoned. The give u a garlic butter for the steak, I always order extra because it's that good. They have a seaweed salad that is better then half of the sushi places I've been to and they give you a way bigger portion probably double the size. The prices are going to be a little more than anyone who runs a lunch special but it's worth every penny. You can't put a price on great food and service. Must go try them out and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Very good food. The sauces given go very well with what you ordered. The food is a great size and is surprisingly filling. Everyone is very friendly and are very willing fill any request! Definitely worth coming here and definitely worth coming with friends!

5/5 overall very good!"}
{"text":"Great service and good clean food! They make it to your liking. We've been here twice and can't complain about anything. Definitely worth our drive."}
{"text":"Quality food complemented by quality service! The employees (and possibly the owner?) are friendly and definitely good about remembering you once you start frequenting the place.  The majority of people seem to order it as take-out, but the food's just as good for dining in as well. Though there's only about five small tables. 

Usually get the ribeye, which is always cooked perfectly and extremely tender and flavorful. The garlic butter makes it even more outstanding. Also there are several sauces to choose from as well if you desire.

My only wishes would be the addition of broccoli being added to their veggie mix (onions, squash, carrots) and a regular house salad of some sort being added to the menu. They seem open to suggestions and feedback though, so maybe we'll relay our thoughts to them next time."}
{"text":"Pretty good place that cooks the food fresh for your bento. I ordered chicken and salmon, the latter of which they cook to your desired doneness. Food gets served with your choice of sauce on the side but since it was my first time they gave me a few to try. I recommend the spicy mayo and ginger. Gave me some miso soup on the house to try as well which was cool. Definitely a good place to stop by for lunch or to take something on the go."}
{"text":"1st time here and we were very pleased. The Shrimp tempura was crispy and absolutely the freshest tasting shrimp I've had since buying it right off of the shrimp boat in Charleston SC! The Angus is top of the line 1855 premium beef so that pretty much speaks for itself. A must try is the spicy chicken wontons, crispy, flaky and so full of flavor. The sides and different homemade dipping sauces were so yummy. 
The staff was super friendly and the chef came out and chatted with us for a while and explained some of the dishes. This little gem is the real deal. If you want authentic, FRESH teppan at super reasonable prices then this is your place. I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I had the calamari+steak combo $10.50(fried rice upgrade $1.90) and a shrimp tempura app $6.90, and boy I was so full! Price is reasonable for me. They are generous with their sauces(which they personally make), and they have a lot to choose from. A big plus is the friendly staff. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"My new go to spot!! It's exactly like a real teppan dinner without the show haha! Quality food is top notch too! Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"Food quality is excellent, and service is great!! We loved salmon and steak with garlic butter. Highly recommend anyone enjoy healthy and tasty food!"}
{"text":"I ordered chicken and steak and when I got home I started feeling sick as a dog. I feel like the chicken was not fully cooked. I was so sick and it lasted 2 days. Needless to say,  I am never going back. Be aware of the chicken folks!"}
{"text":"What a great little place! The food was quick, affordable and the staff was very friendly. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome Japanese food. Friendly staff. Great food. Sushi was yummy. The rib-eye was very tender. Katsu, was good, light & flaky, and katsu sauce was good too. The salmon was delicious. Fresh lemon water was very refreshing. Tried 5 different house made sauces, all were really tasty. Quick service...We'll be back"}
{"text":"This place is so good! I've been wanting to check it out, & I'm glad I did! So much food & good quality for for reasonable prices! I got the salmon and steak! It comes with garlic butter and it's yummy! I'm definitely coming back soon! Staff is super friendly too. The owners is fantastic & really funny! Thank you guys! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Being new to the area thought I would give this place a try and must I say it's definitely a hidden gem, I stopped by the hookah lounge next door for some hookah and saw this place from the service to the food it was all amazing. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back very soon thanks Kevin and staff."}
{"text":"Great food great service almost a hidden gem, it's like you took Osaka or Benihana, cut the prices in half and added a better quality of food. Extremely friendly staff, and now they have bite squad so I may not see them as much but it's nice to know good food is still found at random spots."}
{"text":"I am utterly puzzled, my experience did not mirror the majority shared here. We planned to dine in, but there was no open seating. No worries, we live around the block so I felt a to go order wouldn't compromise the quality. 

The steak bento box was suggested when I asked for recommendations, so I got that  - medium rare, and an order of gyoza and chicken katsu. Service was friendly, but they seemed very overwhelmed. To my surprise the wait was minimal. 

Our meal was still piping hot when we unpackaged it. The 110+ temps might have helped. Digging in the gyoza was fine, but rather run of the mill. The katsu was fried crisp and tender, but it was pretty greasy. The steak was bland and the pieces ranged from rare to well done. It was quite bizarre. Two scoops of white rice - yawn. Sauce of some sort was needed. It's possible we were given the garlic butter sauce in the bento box, but it was thick, clumpy and not at all delicious. Sadly, the veggies were the highlight.

I like to support small business, but it's difficult when the first impression is rather flawed."}
{"text":"The interior of the restaurant isn't anything to brag about. Friendly staff and cooks. Feels like a family owned and operated place, don't know if it is. I went with my sister while staying at South Point for a conference. She normally doesn't finish her plate, or box here, but she did. They gave us 6 or 7 dipping sauces and the garlic butter sauce for the steak was absolute fuego. Ordered a mixed 6 piece gyoza and received 9 pieces. We had prime rib, steak, grilled calamari, all 5 stars."}
{"text":"Discovered this new bento haven today! The staff is very friendly, place is clean, prices are not bad at all and last but not least, the food is delicious and fresh (esp for someone very picky like me.) I ordered calamari & salmon combo and shrimp & chicken. Yummy!  I'll be coming back...That's for sure."}
{"text":"Everything is cooked fresh to order. I've tried the shrimp, salmon and Angus beef. All delicious.. The chicken fried rice is so good I don't even have to doctor it up like I do with all other fried rice. It's a family run business and they are very friendly and helpful. They need to work on a few things to make it 5 stars for me. They need real glasses instead of tiny mouth rinsing size paper cups they offer water in. They also need fountain drinks or at least need to offer some diet or no calorie drinks. They've been open 2 months hopefully they will be around. Food is good and fresh .. Decently priced. Try it :)"}
{"text":"We're always on the lookout for good places to eat for lunch near our office and we lucked out on Teppan Bento. Great family run business with excellent food and service. The nice gentleman cooking the food has experience working in some of the finer dining Teppan places around town so he's got the skills. I ordered the Ribeye lunch medium rare and he nailed it. My wife got the marinated chicken and shrimp combo and both were cooked to perfection. Nothing was chewy and everything had great flavor, spring for the fried rice too. Finally, we are a big fan of dipping sauces and Teppan Bento didn't disappoint. Plenty of sauces to choose from and all delicious. Can't wait til they start delivering!"}
{"text":"***UPDATING MY REVIEW***

I have been going to Teppan Bento for years. My only complaint is that it is inconsistent.

FOOD: Teppanyaki is referring to the way the food is prepared. It is sauteed on a large steel grill. The bento refers to the divided compartments allowing you to have a few sides with your dish. For your starch, you can chose their white rice, brown rice, or fried rice. For your meat, you can get a wide variety like chicken, pork, shrimp, beef, calamari, salmon, and more. All bentos are  sevrved with mixed veggies. For sauces, they provide a garlic butter in the bento and you can ask for additional sauces on the side like their popular yum yum sauce or mustard sauce. My biggest complaint is that it is always a hit or miss with this place. Some days the veggies are overcooked while others the steak is overcooked.

ATMOSPHERE: Their food is served in a plastic bento box whether you dine in or out. I prefer not to eat in the restaurant because the smell of food definitely sticks on you. You can watch the cook make your food in the open kitchen."}
{"text":"We came here to see what the buzz was all about, and we were pleasantly surprised. All of the food we ordered came out very delicious. For a teriyaki style take out place, the quality of food is excellent. For someone looking for healthy, protein-packed options; this is a grest spot. The mom - pop feel of the place was nice as both people working went out of they're way to make our dine in experience enjoyable. They even brought us some free samples, to sweeten the deal! I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a quick, inexpensive, and lighter fare lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The tuna steak is great.  Love the steak bento as well.  Great price for a good meal."}
{"text":"Delicious as always! I have been here twice before, and ordered take out. This was the first time I dined in. Either way, the food is phenomenal. The owners here are always so nice and accommodating. I received the free gyoza app for checking in, and it was a big serving and very tasty! I will definitely be back time and time again."}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here after reading the reviews, but this place was not good at all. I ended up leaving my plate with a couple of bites only. The food had no flavor and the curry came out cold. I have the fried gyoza \"mix\" and tasted like one raw onion.  I wouldn't come again."}
{"text":"I feel really bad about giving this place two stars because the lady who seems to own it is very nice. The food is about about a 5/10. The atmosphere is very low rent. The table was dirty when we sat down. We got bento boxes. The veggies are like frozen reheated veggies. My chicken was nothing special, just some chicken and marginal teriyaki. The California roll was ok, not great, not bad. The reason I gave it two stars was because the prices were pretty low otherwise I would have gave it one star. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place is consistently awesome and delicious. All of the sauces are great, too. Efficient and friendly service."}
{"text":"A wonderful shop to break up the usual fast food joints in the Silverado ranch area.  Although it is small and new the quality is amazing. I have lived in Japan and these bento boxes are spot on. The price for a shrimp and steak box is below what I expected and the quality is so above what I expected. This is not your cookie cutter hipster place. The facility is clean and the staff is wonderful. I had a longer wait but I watched Kevin handle a dinner rush with such grace and respect you can't help but feel patient and respect the heart they are putting into this shop.  I love supporting business like this and would love to see it always busy."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! My friend and I shared the steak and shrimp bento and ordered a side of calamari tempura. The food was prepared very well and very fast. Service was phenomenal. The worker (who may or may not have been the owner) let us try all of the sauces even though it says we can only pick two for a bento. Definitely coming back!! Trust me, it is not a disappoint."}
{"text":"What a total gem this place is!!!  The food was amazingly fresh.  I got the combination bento with shrimp and steak.  It was so fresh and you could tell that it was top quality meat.  Not only was the food amazing, but the couple that runs the restaurant couldn't be any sweeter.  They review the menu with you to ensure that you are getting exactly what you want. Then they continue to check in with you during your meal offering many different sauces for your meat and seafood.  Definitely putting this in our rotation."}
{"text":"I get the chicken and steak bento, it is fantastic.  The owner is super friendly too."}
{"text":"I still cannot get over how good their Scottish Salmon is. It's literally something that you would expect from a high end restaurant. I tried their shrimp tempura and it was not very good. I guess I was expecting more of a \"panko\" crust. The shrimp was really crunchy, almost too crunchy. Almost $7 for only 6 pieces is a little too expensive (I had to finish it all, or I would've felt bad); it would've been worth it if the crust was actually good. The reason why my review is going from a four star to a three is because I saw a cockroach underneath my table (I can only imagine how many are in the kitchen). Still a pretty good place to eat at but I really hope that they get rid of the cockroaches."}
{"text":"Favorite place for this type of food. I love it so much. Service is always good. And the food is always satisfying."}
{"text":"I am very impressed with this husband and wife team.  For a take out it deserves five stars. The quality of the food is top notch. I will be a regular there, the only disappointment, I didn't realize they had ginger butter! I haven't had that since I left the East Coast! I guess it's a great excuse to go back!! Watch your back Sushi Mon! I ordered the angus beef u don noodles, and calamari."}
{"text":"I saw the yelp reviews and gave this place a try. I am thrilled I did as I have a new restaurantreally close to home I know I can go to. 

My fiancée and I went for lunch and decided to get a roll and a bento box each. The roll (spicey tuna) was about average, but the bento boxes were great. My fiancée had the calamari and chicken while I got the steak and shrimp. She really liked the calamari and I found both of my options to be excellent. The boxes came with rice (we both got brown), veggies and sauces. The sauces were a spicey sauce (get it if you like the heat), mustard and spicey mayo. The steak was cooked exactly how I like it and the shrimp were perfectly prepared. Overall I can best compare the qualitie to other high end teppanyaki places.

The service was excellent and very attentive. Our waitress checked in on us several times. 

One word of caution is that the restaurant is not huge. We went at 12:30 on a Friday and it was fairly busy. I imagine at 11 or 12 it is packed."}
{"text":"As restaurant owner myself, I find this place very pleasing.  Food and service is always very good.  My favorite dish is the beef steak bento box.  This has become my favorite local food place to go and almost go about 3-4 times a week.  This is a must try which will keep you coming back over and over."}
{"text":"The food here is really amazing!!! I love their angus steak especially with the garlic butter sauce!!! 

The owner is so friendly and nice. He even offered to babysit my puppy because the store next door doesn't allow pets."}
{"text":"Most amazing salmon and shrimp bento box I've ever had. Fish was so delicious. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good and Kevin was nice as well. I will be coming back for sure. You get a lot of food for your money and easily can be 2 meals."}
{"text":"Came here tonight and was very impressed. We got the marinated & Katsu chicken,  the salmon,  side of the shrimp tempura as well as the free gyoza appetizer (free w/ check-in)! All were very good and made right, loved that they had many sauces to choose from. I really like the ginger and the spicy mayo. I also like the fact that they serve the food in ready To-Go Bento boxes! 

This will now be our new Bento spot, since Vegas seems to lack more of. The owners/workers were all very friendly and welcoming, as this is a very warm, inviting & family-oriented establishment and they all made sure we were happy with our food. We are definitely coming back here for sure!"}
{"text":"The food was really good! I highly recommend the chicken katsu lunch bento & steak lunch bento boxes. Perfect portion and fresh off the grill. Me and my boyfriend came in for lunch after the gym and we are leaving this place HIGHLY SATISFIED. The long amount of wait is well worth the taste of the food. However, the waitress didn't visit our table as much. The cook had to check on all the customers and cook the food. But overall, it was a great first time here. I will be back to try other boxes."}
{"text":"One of the most enjoyable meals I have ever had! Wonderful people and amazing food. I could eat this everyday !!!"}
{"text":"Update (1 month later)

I really appreciate this place even more now. They truly take care of their customers and they show that they care as a business to deliver exceptional service. We had ordered a lot and they accidentally forgot something . We let them know and they were more than courteous to get us the items. I can't say enough good things about the place and service!"}
{"text":"I had some time before a client today and I was craving some yummy hot tea and a place to do some paperwork...and I found it.

Empty when I entered around noon, I grabbed a booth and settled in. 

Quickly the owner greeted me with a smile and sat menus down in front of me. 

I asked for hot tea and he said he had several options. Me not needing any caffeine I opted for the jasmine, it was amazing. It came with a super fresh juicy lemon. He brought me another cup with my entree. 

It smelled sooo amazing in there I got hungry. I ordered seaweed salad, veggie tempura and a vegetable sushi roll.
Veggie tempura is NOT on the menu, I took a risk and asked for it, he said they could accommodate. 

Seaweed salad was plentiful and the flavor was on point. I like a lot of sesame flavor and it has it.

Tempura came out and I was super excited for my Friday cheat day meal. (we don't eat oil and almost wheat free(vegan) 
Praying my tummy would not hurt later, upon first taste...I didn't care.

The veggies were quick flash fried and the carrots and other veg were super crisp and fresh inside. Broccoli, carrots, asparagus, onion layer, and white sweet potato! 

The roll I ordered never came and thank goodness it didn't! It would have been waaaaay too much food :)

The owner is super nice. He asked how my day was going, what I do, about my electric car, and was super sweet. Made me feel welcome and like family.

I highly recommend this restaurant, support local businesses, enjoy."}
{"text":"The salmon, tuna, and marinated chicken were delicious!  They brought out many different delicious sauces to try: chipotle, yum yum, tonkatsu. 

Lim and Kevin were super nice to my Mom and I on our first visit. I'm very happy to have a bento box Japanese restaurant in the neighborhood.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. They have the best service and everything on the menu is delicious. You can't go wrong with anything you order. Price and portion is is amazing. You get more than you pay for. I am one happy customer for life."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and we love it!! Ordered the katsudon with beef curry and shrimp teppanyaki bento box. Very flavorful and unique taste. We will come back for more. And thanks for the dessert!"}
{"text":"I dont really want to write a review but yelp wont let me just put rate this place so thats why im writing this. Yum."}
{"text":"This is a great little local spot. Great service, friendly staff and inexpensive menu. The ginger sauce is the business! Killer gyoza too."}
{"text":"IN LOVE with this little restaurant TEPPAN BENTO!  Met my friend here, we both ordered 2 entry bento my choice was the most tender steak and fresh salmon. My friend ordered shrimp and chicken. The server made sure our water was full and brought out every type of sauce. Thank you , I'll be back"}
{"text":"On my bucket list, I've always wanted to try an authentic bento style dinner, This place is worth every single penny. I live all the way in north Las Vegas and I went all the way over there to try their food. If I was in another country I would come all the way back to Nevada for their food. Their kindness is so refreshing and there love for there craft is so astonishing. I love the people there and I love their food. If it ever came down to going out to eat and spending money I would go to this place time and time again. \"Cooking with love provides food for the soul\" These people have given me happiness beyond compare."}
{"text":"Juicy and flavorful bento boxes and terrific homemade sauces made for a delicious lunch. Service was extremely friendly too! Portions and prices are just right!"}
{"text":"My husband's coworkers when here for lunch last week and raved about it. So hubby stopped by to grab dinner on his way home. I had the beef steak bento with mixed veggies and steamed rice, and he had the chicken and shrimp double bento with veggies and steamed rice. Both were out of this world. The steak was tender and cooked perfectly, both the chicken and shrimp had great flavors, and the veggies were very fresh and had a nice flavor to them as well. They offered him four different sauces to go with dinner. The pink creamy one was his favorite, and the habanero was mine, but they also tasted good mixed. It's kind of like a diner atmosphere, so very casual. He said the owners were very nice and he could tell they took pride in their food.

Will definitely be back here, and am highly recommending this place if you like fresh japanese food."}
{"text":"My friend and I were so excited to try this place and man were we satisfied!! The food comes bento style and the portions are great for the price! Everything tasted so good! We definitely will be coming back and I will be bringing people here as well!"}
{"text":"Saw Teppan Bento on Yelp and decided to try it. Great choice, the Salmon is amazing, along with the steak, yum!!! They have all kinds of dipping sauces too, my favorite is the hot sauce and my husbands is the garlic butter. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Whatever you choose they're all great!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch and a great value to boot. Tried nearly everything. Salmon was to die for, steak was superb. Friendly, gracious service. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"A gem of a place. A friend invited me to lunch to Teppan Bento. It was my first visit and I was impressed with the flavors of food and sauces. I ordered the chicken teriyaki and it came with fresh crisp salad and light ginger based dressing along with two gyoza  and rice. The portions were healthy and the meats were super savory and amazingly tender. The owner, Kevin was welcoming and extremely friendly. I felt like I was in his home. They take pride in their quality and I assure you will get it at all levels. Great value for the flavors, quality and quantity. I had such a great experience the first time, I returned and brought my entire staff and treated them to lunch. Their comments were \"The steak lunch was uber juice and tender, it melts in your mouth.\" The other staff member ordered more fried rice and said, \"I can eat this all day, it's so good.\" Both said, we will be bringing our spouses here to share the experience. You've heard my story and experience. If you like Teppan Bento style food or if you like Japanese or Chinese or any Asian style/flavors, this is a stop you have to try at the corner of Silverado Ranch and Bermuda adjacent to New Day Café."}
{"text":"Eaten here twice and loved it twice.  Five stars every time!  I've only tried the steak and shrimp bento box but that's because it's too good not to eat again.  Whether you are dining in or picking up I highly recommend this place.  Mixing teppanyaki and bento boxes created a magical combination!"}
{"text":"It's been several months since we moved away from Henderson, but we still reminisce about this delicious restaurant. We used to get the shrimp, salmon, and the chicken. The fish is extra awesome if you're lucky and they've got a fresh shipment in. The cooks and staff were always friendly and wonderful, offering up so many sauces to try and passion about their food! I hope that the scarce seating has been solved by now. But takeout is always an option. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Pretty good place.  The portions were a nice size. I got the salmon and steak combo and it came with veggies and brown rice. The salmon was cooked perfect and so was the steak. It also came with some sauces too."}
{"text":"Service was nice. Very friendly and warm :)
But the overall atmosphere in the restaurant isn't that great. Definitely better for take out than dining in.
The portion size was okay. 
I got the salmon poke, and I really liked how they let me switch out the rice with the salad! But the big thing that got was how SALTY everything was.
Food would've have tasted so much better if they didn't put that much salt. It was getting to the point where I couldn't take another bite without having to drink a huge gulp of water right after. 
My friend got the steak and salmon bento, and the salmon was really salty as well and it was dry. Steak was good, but was also too salty.
The shrimp tempura was also too overcooked. Though tempura does mean \"fried\" in japanese, fried shrimp in Japan is totally different from the American fried shrimp. The shrimp tempura in this case was just like the \"fried shrimp\" that's breaded and not coated in the traditional potato starch mixture of the japanese shrimp tempura. 

Sorry, but I wouldn't come here again. Service was awesome but the food wasn't."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is great! Garlic butter and shrimp tempura amazing ! We all eat here very very often . Kevin the owner is so friendly and kind. This place was a genius idea. Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing. I tried the bento with marinated chicken and steak. Sauces made the meat even better. Only issues is no unlimited drink and was about 30 for 2 people but was worth it."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! I get the salmon w/ beef combo & fried rice. The dipping sauce that comes with it tops it off. Friendly staff every time we come in! I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Seems to be under new management and food is not as great as before. My friend and I came here for lunch recently & we can definitely taste the difference.
I always get the steak here and they always cooked it the perfect medium rare but since they have a new cook , most of the steak pieces were well done & some that were a bit on the medium rare side turned well done right away. Server did not initially ask me how I wanted my steak but all the other times I dined here they always made it medium rare (tastes best like that anyways) so I just assumed my steak will be cooked the same way. Overall , the steak tasted bad and the main reason why I came here is for their steak.
They don't have garlic butter anymore when we asked our server. I never ever ever get butter on the side at restaurants except for this place. So my friend & I were a bit disappointed about that since their salmon and garlic butter go so great with each other. We would get a lot of sauce options already given but they seem to not do that anymore unless you specifically ask. The pinkish sauce my friend got w/ her salmon tasted more like thousand island sauce - I did not like.
The vegetable options were just terrible - it was mainly ALL ONIONS !!! Mixed with cabbage. With few pieces of broccoli and carrots.
Used to be a great lunch option but now I'll just skip :("}
{"text":"Ordered seared tuna, and salmon bentos. The food and sides were delicious. The salads were fresh and you can tell the fish was good quality. 

I do think they need to re do their interiors. I know they replaced some sandwich shop or whatever it was but when I step into a japanese restaurant you expect something a little more elegant. 

Price-wise it is ok but again the place just a needs a little TLC."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick bite. Place was clean and the owner/cook/server was really nice and accommodating. I ordered the salmon poke salad while my husband had the tuna steak. Portions were huge and the food tasted fresh. The hub commented on how good the vegetables tasted good so the owner offered to cook him some more. Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"This is great discover!! perfectly season and cook don't need any dipping sauce.  absolutely delicious.     friendly staff make you feel very welcoming as well. looking forward to taste rest of menu :)"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and food is full of flavor! Not to mention their dipping sauces! So glad we tried this place! The customer service was excellent and very friendly"}
{"text":"Lunch today for the first time. We ordered the steak and salmon bento. The salmon was amazing. Next time will be ordering double salmon! Super friendly staff and very attentive."}
{"text":"Such a gem in our neighborhood!  Super friendly people and big portions of great fresh food at good prices."}
{"text":"Excellent bento! The food was fresh, and cooked to order. Try the steak with melted butter and mustard sauce SO YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"I've been to this little restaurant twice now, and both times I've been extremely happy.  The food tastes fantastic and the cost is perfectly reasonable.  Don't expect your food right away though, it is made to order and you can tell by how fresh it is.  The quality of the food is like what you would expect from a more formal restaurant yet in a nice small casual setting.

I ordered the chicken and steak and my girlfriend had the chicken and shrimp.  Both the steak and chicken was tender and tasted great, and the shrimp was so good I'm definitely getting it for myself next time.  This place is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Great place. Quiet and simple atmosphere. Obviously a mom and pop shop. Service is excellent! Only downside is limited menu but they tell me they're fixing that. I will have to amend review when I try more options. 
They now have sushi! It's wonderful basic nigiri and sashimi! The Scottish salmon is so tender that it can be eaten with chopsticks. The salmon has become my favorite."}
{"text":"Had this delivered and Bite Squad took forever. But the food was mediocre. I wanted to try it for a long time so I'm glad I'm not wondering anymore.  Maybe in the restaurant but the food is a little better but not good for takeout."}
{"text":"It was ok. Atmosphere: wasn't really trying. Lighting was flat white as were the walls. It wasn't terribly dirty but felt cluttered. There weren't  any people Service: satisfactory.  Food: I got a steak and chicken bento. Could've had more seasoning on both. Maybe it explains the side sauce, I wish the protein was a tad more generous. I spent around 15 including tip. I could've gone to an AYCE KBBQ lunch.  You could try it, but for what it was, I probably wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"I love to support new local businesses and this became on my radar after scoping it out in my favorite section of Yelp... the Hot and New Businesses. I'm so glad I finally stopped by. I had a great experience and will be eating here more often.

I recommend the Calamari Tempura with spicy mayo sauce. That was so good! I also loved my Black Angus Steak Bento Box, cooked perfectly to medium rare at my request. The ginger sauce went really well with the steak, as well as the garlic butter that came with the meal.

The atmosphere is nothing fancy. The quality of the food as well as the excellent service are the true shining stars of this establishment. And really, what more do you need? Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Family owned and operated teppanyaki shop specializing in bento boxes: pick a protein or two, side it with rice and veggies, pick a couple sauces, and go on your way. Seems to be more of a grab and go spot but the food is solid, especially for those who prefer real food or are watching their calories, macros, etc. but still want their food to have flavor. Steak (cooked perfectly to medium, as requested) with garlic sauce is awesome.

Specials board indicates that they have poke, Yelp check in deal gets you a free order of gyoza. I like that they have several sauces to choose from to add flavor to healthy options, which sets them apart from similar spots."}
{"text":"Hmmm... I have such mixed feelings about this place. I actually want to say 3.5 stars. I guess I'll get the negatives out of the way since it's quicker.
1. I don't think this place is a very good value for your money. It's a little on the high side and you don't get that much quantity in my opinion either.
2. I have no idea what's going on with their website.

That's it for the negatives.
The food was very tasty. I had the beef with salmon bento with fried rice option and I ordered a chicken katsu bento to go. They give you a lot of delicious dipping sauces too which I love. Who doesn't love Garlic Butter anyways? And it was prepared very quickly. The staff is extremely friendly too but I'm beginning to think it's because they are trying to justify their slightly high prices. I was trying to get up to throw away my trash and they all insisted I sit back down so they could throw it away for me.
They also explained to me at length (without me asking) the quality of the beef that they use and the different levels they use relative to other places, which is why I believe that they know they are pricey and are trying to justify it to me so I'd come back.
Definitely give it a try for yourself at the very least."}
{"text":"Really good food and service! I was referred here on a special from Kung Fu Tea next door and the service here was excellent and welcoming. Will definitely dine here again in the future."}
{"text":"Amazing service! This is my go-to dinner every other tuesday before I hit up the $5 movie night at South Point. The marinated chicken and shrimp box is my favorite! Boyfriend always orders the steak (medium) and shrimp box, both orders are always cooked to perfection. The chef takes his time to actually speak with the customers and ensure they feel comfortable and his recommendations never fail. Can't forget the shrimp tempura with the poke sauce. Man that Poke sauce is the best! Every time I visit I never see anyone else dine in, only to-go orders, I recommend staying for lunch/dinner, you won't regret it! :)"}
{"text":"They have the cheapest bento boxes I've ever came across. I ordered the marinated chicken and calamari combo for $9.50 I believe. The portions were good I even had left overs, and I really enjoyed their food. For their price, you really can't go wrong with this place! I personally didn't enjoy the calamari as much as I thought, but it wasn't bad either. If you order two or more bento boxes you get half off of their appetizers. So I tried the shrimp tempura and it was sooo good! Even better with their spicy mayo sauce. All in all, this place is definitely one to check out if you're looking for a cheap bento box but still want that quality food"}
{"text":"This place puts the T in Terrible!! They delivered to our hotel and the food was not even edible!! Don't waste your time order from this place!! 0 stars!!"}
{"text":"My husband tried the Chicken Yakisoda and I had the two item Bento with Salmon and Shrimp. We also ordered a couple of appetizers. All of the food was great! The owners were very attentive to any customer needs and came out to speak to everyone. The location is a bit of a hole in the wall, but sometimes the very best places are. We'll definitely be repeat customers and recommend this place to friends. :)"}
{"text":"Good bento. The sauces are great, love that they give you several to try. Good take out."}
{"text":"Not every place is a foodie haven. Some places are just a good place to go for good food.  Bento steak and salmon came with veggies and fried rice as well as dipping sauces and garlic butter. I checked in on Yelp and got free gyoza. I was there with a friend and her 5 kids. No food complaints from the kids. I will be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful sushi!!!!!! Salmon poke just so delicious!!!!!! The steak and salmon agh..... Craving to have more, the chicken katsu so tender and juicy, the fried rice so perfect they have special recipe that you couldn't find in anywhere... And GARLIC BUTTER!!!(the best) its so so so good.... All the sauce they made it with secret recipe!! Wonderful place to go"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!! Dined here with my gf on a Saturday night and had no regrets! The food was prepared deliciously and flavors were on point. The bento boxes have just the right amount of food to feel satisfied and everything just tasted fresh. I highly recommend this place and will definitely bring my family here! :)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and it was surprisingly empty, which was a plus for me. Fast service is my number one priority when taking time away from the office to eat. We sat down in a booth and although the counter gives the impression of an L&L where you order at the front then find a seat with your number, we actually were served by a waiter. This was a pleasant surprise. I'll be back to fulfill my bento box cravings on my lunch breaks. The price for the lunch menu is super fair, too. I was stuffed on my special.

My friend and I both got katsu chicken, but I got mine with curry and he got his without. The curry wasn't bad, but it was thick and heavy. It just felt like too much food when paired with the katsu. The chicken was awesome and in the end I wish I had skipped the curry option and gone for straight rice. There is always next time! Nothing else on my plate was super memorable but I would suggest the pan-fried potstickers. If I wanted a snack and not a meal I would go for those a hundred times over. Yummy!"}
{"text":"My BF and I were on the hunt for something for dinner. We found this spot and decided to try it out because of the reviews and ratings.

Super excited to find a bento style restaurant near our house. We were greeted and employees were nice and friendly. I ordered the steak & shrimp bento, My BF ordered the Steak & Katsu bento & my sister got the shrimp bento.

The steak was ok. Not horrible but not great either. Shrimp was actually a decent size and amount, I usually find that when you order shrimp at these places...you get those little shrimps. I also got the fried rice which was interesting and not my favorite. And lastly, the veggies and some kind of mayo sauce 

They had given us a bunch of sauces which we had no clue what they were?!? BUT...I'm such a sauce/condiment kinda gal, I decided to try them. Those were a no go. Also I felt it was a little overpriced for me.

I had such high hopes for this place w/ the ratings and reviews. Overall, I'm super bummed that I didn't enjoy the food as much as I had hoped I would 
Since it was close to home. 

I'll just stick to my fav bento restaurant and make the drive to Teriyaki House on Rainbow."}
{"text":"Love this food ! Yummm , great service!!!Also, the hookah lounge next door is a perfect way to top the night or  you can get them to cater to you at oasis hookah lounge next door!"}
{"text":"Lets start off by how awesome the service is here.  Kevin the owner is very welcoming! Its great to know that i can get a quick tepenyaki bento thats fulfilling and flavorful. Lets not forget about all the sauces you can try out. The garlic sauce is a must!"}
{"text":"Really nice family run business, ribeye was delish, veggies too. Definitely for takeout and not for dining in though, the room is unappealing. Add this to your rotation of weeknight dinners for sure, the food quality is a step above and very worthy of these good reviews."}
{"text":"I like this place, the food is great for the price, friendly stuffsGenerally always getting the Black Angus Steak Bento with chicken fire rice & vegetables!!
Their special dipping sauces were full of flavor.
I do recommend ordering ahead & walking in and picking up,aThey are pretty fast serving up!!!"}
{"text":"I've always seen these guys on Yelp but never got a chance to stop by.

While passing by today around the area I finally got the time to see what they were about and I'm pretty glad I did.

I ordered their combination with steak and shrimp, both were cooked perfectly. Nothing gets to me more than when you go into a restaurant and you ask for medium rare and they give you well done. Orrrr when you order shrimp and it's rubbery and overcooked, but teppan bento never crossed me with this issue. If I had 3 wishes Mr. Aladddin sir, it would be to have perfectly cooked steak, shrimp, and salmon.

The bento comes with different sauces; I had garlic butter, spicy wasabi, and garlic butter aioli I think it was? Regardless it was good. And service was A++
They consistently checked on us, asked us while cooking what our preferences were, and offered us sauces to try. They were pretty attentive and polite and I think that makes the establishment a \"diamond in the rough.\"

I think i'll get the salmon next time since my friend got it medium done, and just off of the small bit I tried; it opened me to a \"whole new world.\""}
{"text":"I have been coming here since the early days of Teppan Bento. This food is phenomenal and always friendly service! The food quality is what you would expect from an expensive Teppanyaki restaurant but much more affordable and quick. Basically take the show and expensive prices out of Benihana's and that is what this place is! Get in there and eat!!!"}
{"text":"Great quality food, Friendly service and they care about the food they put out. I recommend the Ribeye bento!!"}
{"text":"When I'm not traveling I work mainly from home and I mostly don't feel like cooking if I have a really late day. I hopped on Yelp and this place was suggested to me so I decided to give it a try. 

I love bento boxes but I was unsure of the packaging for a take out, but I ordered anyway and somehow got carried away still working 30 minutes later. When I showed up for my pickup, the gentlemen said \"Merry? It's been so long your food is cold I'm sure, can I reheat it for you?\" I was like wow! 10 minutes before closing time and you're still on your A-Game. Then he asked me if I liked spicy sauces and I said yes so he gave me something he called \"his mom's sauce\" and even threw in an appetizer for checking in! Lol my appetite is terrible so I didnt even come close to finishing all the food but I tried it all, and it was all so yummy! TEPPAN Bento was a great find."}
{"text":"For what it is it 5 stars it's your down the street mom n pop shop. Out dated but clean. Food was good. Not expansive and big portions."}
{"text":"I love coming here, especially in between classes/errands. Its embarrassing how the owner recognizes me with how much I come here. 

Though they're pretty quick with getting my order ready, I usually call ahead so I can just pick it up. Steak (medium rare) and shrimp combo with double fried rice, no veggies. I think it only comes with one sauce but the owner always takes care of me and gives me almost all their sauces to taste. Order the spicy mayo and regular yum-yum sauce. So delicious!

This place doesn't get enough publicity or traffic that it deserves though. Its in this corner next to stores no one really goes to.

Two reasons that I took away a star in my rating is because the two times I dinned in at this place ... 1) they don't seem to have proper ventilation which makes the whole place smell weird. Once it was so foggy in there that they had to crack the door open while it was 105+ degrees outside 2) their water tastes metallic or tap water like, no lemon either."}
{"text":"Delicious Japanese bento food.  Super friendly family owned restaurant.  We got the chicken katsu, salmon and steak.  Our kids loved it all.  The chef makes everything fresh and we found out he is a very experienced teppanyaki sous chef who has worked at Benihana.  The use of fresh ingredients combined with special sauces makes this a wonderful off strip place!"}
{"text":"Came in here with my uber picky 8 year old son for lunch and he declared be 'loves this place.' Seriously, if it's not chicken nuggets and fries, he never says that. 

Even more importantly, I just ordered one adult entree to share with him as I doubted he'd eat much. I feel like some places balk at plate sharing, but this guy (the owner I assume), saw we were sharing, took my sons plate back to the kitchen to give extra fried rice. He was soooo friendly! Love giving places with good customer service business. Food and sauces hit the spot as well!!!"}
{"text":"They cooked my salmon medium rare. And they'll make me oxtail curry. Big bowl of miso soup for $3."}
{"text":"Small hidden Japanese restaurant that our party of 41 adults and kids reserved after a recent basketball tournament game. Bento boxes are simple (protein, choice of rice and grilled vegetables) and freshly made. Flavorful without being smothered in sauce, but the homemade sauces on the side are excellent. The oxtail soup was very good also. Kevin, his staff and his mother provided excellent service and even free mango and watermelon at the end of our meal."}
{"text":"Worth the high ratings.  Got the rib-eye steak bento and shrimp yakitori and both items tasted great.   I'm from out of town,  but I'll be back regularly."}
{"text":"I loved my teppan bentoo! I got salmon and katsu and my boo got the stake and katsu.. We dined in and got to sample all their 6 sauces. They were all delicious our fave was the ginger and the spicy yummy sauce. They use high quality ingredients and cook it to perfection. Not to mention the service was amazing. Although it was a counter service style restaurant, the boy who took our order was very attentive to our needs, brought us water without asking if we needed it and kept refilling and getting us more sauce. This place is defiantly a must!"}
{"text":"Was sitting in Del taco line and just thought to myself, there has to be better food around and so I searched in Yelp and found this place. I'm telling you as good as you'll get fresh salmon and vegetables so much better choice in this area and suuuuuuper friendly people. 5 stars easily!!!!!"}
{"text":"We eat here frequently and it's always delicious!! The owner is awesome and makes really good food. It's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I love this place. We frequent at the nearby Thai restaurant and decided to try something different. I love the combo plates and love their calamari as well. Sometimes when I don't feel like eating rice, I'd double on the vegetables which makes the dish a protein healthy dish. It sucks I gave up meat, reason why we stopped going here. Maybe they should add a Tofu option."}
{"text":"This was our first time.  We saw the ad on yelp and had to try it, we were not disappointed the steak and shrimp were very good, Along with the calamari it was a great experience"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great location 5 stars in my book! There should be a warning on the door that says
 \"If you like garlic you're gonna be addicted!\"
Holy smokes is that garlic butter good I put it on my vegetables - the steak they cook and the fried rice! I'm hooked and very grateful I have such a great healthy option really close to one of the places I stay in las vegas. On their site it's says best teppenyaki and that term \"best\" gets thrown around WAY too much but after considering these 3 factors. Quality - service and location this place is the best and gets 5 stars from me! Try the garlic butter on your veggies - it made my life better =)"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time yesterday!!!! The cashier and the cooks were all so friendly and smiley  (I came in like 20min before close) but they still treated me really well!!! The food was so yummy very juicy lots of flavor I was dry happy  I will totally be coming back again"}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this restaurant. I can say there was nothing wrong with the service. I also used their coupon for free pot stickers. The food did not taste very good; especially the free pot stickers. I walked in for pick-up, and while waiting for the food I noticed quite a few crickets through-out the restaurant. Considering it was a short it alarmed me. I don't think I'll be visiting anytime soon."}
{"text":"If you want dine-in, take out, or delivery, YOU HAVE TO TRY TEPPAN BENTO AT LEAST THREE TIMES. 

I've been thinking about this review a lot. I think this is my favorite place to eat at, and id probably pick this place before a lot in Vegas. 

The food: absolutely delicious. Their sauces are great, their meats/seafood always tasted fresh. The food alone is worth everything it me haha. 

Delivery: I ordered from grub hub twice. Their boxes for the food are cute and I always liked the way they came. Very clean and proper. 
The second delivery, our steak was cooked medium instead of rare. I called about it and he said no problem, we can come in whenever we want and he will make us the meal we originally ordered. And THIS is why you should come here if the food, service, and presentation isn't enough for you. 

Two months later I call and ask if he remembered us and if we can come in. (Our car was broken down so we couldn't really make it over there for a while). The same guy picked up and remembered the order/problem right away. He said yes come in! We showed up and it has a very homey vibe. It was just him and a lady working there, we asked for just one cup but she was nice enough to give us two. He cooked the same order we had, we didn't even have to tell him anything. The way they treat you here is very respectful and I am so happy we tried this place to begin with. We live across town, but I will always go out of my way to come here when I can. 

TL;DR this place is amazing and you should do yourself a favor and eat here. The people who work here are amazing and very enjoyable people. 10/10"}
{"text":"tldr

I really like this place, the food is on point and delicious!
The meal was really filling and the combination of vegetables and brown rice with the meats complimented each other.

Got:
-salmon and steak bento; salmon was a little undercooked and the steak was a bit over poked but paired well with the sauces. Came with 4 different sauces that had great flavor."}
{"text":"Wow very happy to find another gem close to home. Took my little angel on date night here. We were greeted by an awesome fella who hopefully owns part of the place. We ordered the NY Steak for $14. The steak was incredible. My angel even said it was as good as mine. Came with garlic butter, awesome an ample supply of white rice and tasty veges. The service was awesome. 5 stars easy. For people who complain about the plastic plate and forks have fun eating way worse food with silverware."}
{"text":"Amazing food, and amazing customer service! You feel so welcome here! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Ugh so good. Everything. I die. And the service, so perfect. Especially for being there not long before closing. Most places make you feel rushed or like they want you to leave but we got the opposite. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This is the best kept secret in all of Las Vegas ! Its kinda like Benihana without the laser light show, high prices, and long waits. I go in there at least once a week and order either the Chicken Teppanyaki or the Steak Teppanyaki. They are both outstanding.

The owner, Kevin, is one of those old-fashioned restaurant guys who remembers you the second time you come in. 

This place is special.. give it a try. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great service and food too! Food tastes fresh and cooked upon ordering. Very affordable and casual environment. We will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"Found this little quaint sushi and teppan food. Food was really good.  Service was very fast. Nice waiter"}
{"text":"Best Oxtail soup in town and amazing pork belly!!! Definitely have to check this Place out. Better than the California hotel downtown if you want oxtail and you don't even have to be up in the middle of the night!"}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I have found a place like this, nothing but exceptional food and fantastic service. Lim the gentleman in the front who takes care of everything is not only a great guy but very knowledgeable on what he has and product. You don't find this type of customer service nowadays portions were good sauces were great and service was better!!!! 

Want a good meal, lunch or dinner, quick and easy but to the point!!! Highly recommend!!!


Your welcome in advance!!!!!!

Go see LIM!"}
{"text":"2nd time here and we chose to get my Mother's Day meal from this place because it's simple and delicious.  You can ask for the amazing Garlic Butter sauce on the side (I am in love with that sauce).  You can never go wrong with the quality of taste in their food.  Great job guys I'll be coming back again and again :)"}
{"text":"seriously, this place is a hidden gem.. the food is fresh and the quality is superb.. 

ordered 4 lunch bento for the fam.. the pork katsu is cooked the way a pork katsu should.. same thing as their chicken katsu.. 

the shrimp tempura is also amazing, it melts in your mouth like butter..

and the thing that got me rolling is that super spicy dip they have.. been a spicy eater for awhile now but gotdamn that thing they have is super good.. 

definitely will comeback for the great food and the spicy dip.."}
{"text":"Delicious food and  friendly staff (family owned place). 

I was worried they didn't have anything vegetarian (didn't see anything on the menu), but they were able to make me up some tofu steaks, with veggies and asparagus, rice and seaweed salad. Their side sauces are delicious. And if you like spicy you have to try the mom's home made hot sauce!  The portions were good and it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp (thanks yelpers for the feedback) only negative thing was the fries rice was cold. 
Ordered the ny steak bento box, shrimp bento box and the yakisoba everything was seasoned well. 
Would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Now here a place I can visit daily.

Bento box also known as lunch box. As in you have lunch everyday so you can get a bento box everyday.

Food 5/5
Amazing quality, large proportions. Plenty of meat to veggie/rice ratio can't complain. Chef was very descriptive and knew what he was doing. 

Restaurant 4/5
Definitely a mom and pop shop. Nothing wrong with that. Just needs some dining area TLC. But right now it's just a pick up order type of place to me

Service 4.5/5
From the second we walked in the chef/owner? Was more than helpful, upbeat and resauraceful. The servers seem kind of slumpish. They could use some motivation and pep in their step. But overall good service.

Love this concept I will be back !"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! This is a must for me now when I come visit Las Vegas! Everyone was very friendly. The owner asked us what music to put on while we ate. I came here based on the reviews and it lived up to the rating. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Well let's start with Kevin who is a go getter! I came for steak sandwiches and left with two bento  boxes. Both the steak and chicken were tender and delicious. We also got calamari and dumplings witch were light and crispy. I don't know what your waiting  for get down there and be good to yourself cause it is great and waiting for you!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Great food great selection, even better customer service. Everyone there takes pride in their food and it really shows!"}
{"text":"Perfect. I ordered the tuna steak, it was beyond words! The waitress provided such an amazing service. The chef came out to see how we liked the food. That's something  we really appreciate. Such friendly people!. The meal portions were just perfect and the food delicious. We are coming back."}
{"text":"If you're craving Benihana but you don't feel like being fancy, just go to Teppan Bento!  Their teppan cooked dishes are amazing!

Located on the southeast corner of Bermuda and Silverado Ranch, I was greeted and seated by a nice elderly lady.  Darius was the guy handling the kitchen (I knew because the elderly lady kept calling his name whenever someone placed an order or needed anything).

The interior of this place is plain, but you are going to be amazed with their menu.  

I Looked at the menu with pictures on the wall and was sold on the certified angus beef bento.  The pictures looked great, so I'm hoping that the real thing is great!  They did not disappoint!

In about 5 less than 10 mins I got my hot steak bento.  You can get a choice of steamed rice or fried rice.  I figured that my bento would have enough going on, so I decided to stick with the plain steamed rice.  Other than two scoops of rice, the steak bento came with a very generous portion of steak (cut in cubes), veggies, garlic butter, hot mustard sauce, and spicy sauce.

The garlic butter was amazing!  The garlic butter had chunks of fried garlic.  The hot mustard was not too strong, but whoah....the spicy sauce was really spicy!  And if you didn't catch the spiciness the first second, it will creep up to you in a few seconds!  Spicy as hell, but awesome!  

My steak was cooked medium rare, and it came out juicy and full of flavor.  The steak is great with a bit of garlic butter and dipped in the hot mustard (or the spicy sauce....or BOTH).  Every bite was like a taste of heaven.

Their tap water is flavored with lemon/lime (you can see the water jar full of lemon/limes on the counter when you walk in).  

This place has me hooked!  I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Another Yelp life lesson: sometimes you have to take in all of the variables such as, do yelpers in a certain areas have enough good Japanese restaurants to come up with good comparisons? This can lead to a four and a half star rating that means nothing.

Food was ok. My medium rare steak was not very rare but decent. Not beef jerky, which is bearable. My wife's chicken was really dry. 

Walked in and the restaurant had a very strange smell. Waiters were nice though. Not coming back."}
{"text":"I came for lunch on a Friday with my family. We should have known the experience wouldn't have been good because the place was completely empty. When we walked in the owner seem to not even care about us and was not friendly at all. When we got our food we noticed that the portions were extremely small. $12.50 for a bento with a small piece of salmon and a few small chunks of steak. This was completely not worth it, especially since they tried to fill up the entire bento with rice but no meat to eat with the rice. The meat was dry and the steak was not medium well like I asked; instead it was overcooked and bone dry. The other two dishes we got was the teriyaki chicken bento and a salmon bento that also had small portions of meat and dry. I do not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"My wife gave her salmon and shrimp plate 5 stars.  She wanted to go back 2 days later.  I got the chicken bento meal.  The chicken was salty and rubbery.  I like the concept of a cheap fast version of Benihana but it just wasn't good enough for me to go back."}
{"text":"Overall the food was okay, but as the stars indicated I've had better. Not to say that Teppan Bento was terrible it was just \"Meh\".

The day I went, Friday evening, the place wasn't crowded at all. There was only one other group there. Seemed like the entire place was being operated one guy who was personable and pretty attentive. I did notice that the back three booths seemed to be piled up with misc items (dishes, a baby stroller, etc). This didn't really take away from the ambiance, but just a little disorganized looking besides I was there to chow down and not romance my girlfriend. I mean c'mon, wining and dining my girl requires a visit to KFC or at the very least - Chuck'E'Cheese (Baller!!!) 

So the menu is pretty straightforward and varied. I ordered the chicken breast/thigh and calamari box, but was told that there wasn't any more chicken thigh so it would just be chicken breast and calamari. No biggie.

The food came out and it looked okay, nothing impressive. The amount of chicken breast provided was a little skimpy in my opinion. I thought I'd get a bigger helping since there wasn't any chicken thigh that day (Guess not). The veggies looked tired like they just pulled a 12 hour graveyard shift. The calamari was in box form (Usually prefer tentacle form).  However with any food review the tastes trump the looks.

So how did it taste? It tasted okay, nothing to write home about, but nothing really warranting a return visit either. Chicken was nothing special. Calamari was chewy and also nothing special. Veggies were a bit soggy and tired. The same tired like a single mother coming home from her third job serving tables at Chuck'E'Cheese and finding out that Little Billy lost his retainer at school again. C'mon Billy!!! That thing is expensive! You think money grows on trees? .......So I digress........

Teppan Bento - it's okay if you happen to be in the area, but the value and quality for the money wasn't really worth it. There are better places out in Vegas (like KFC)."}
{"text":"Finally made it here for lunch today and it was a really good experience. Black Angus steak was perfect and the calamari was tender and fresh.
Good rice and even better fried rice, it was cooked to order and you could taste that it was just made and not pre-cooked. The best part was it was not 
overly oily. Veggies were cut with thought and again cooked with care and tasted delicious. Excellent seaweed salad and gyoza too.
Sauces were good with everything, it didn't seem to matter and they give you plenty of it. I kind of wished they had some kind of noodle choice, but still won't reduce the 5 star rating.
Drinks are in cans, but still won't knock any stars off for that either. Great place, nothing fancy inside, but the food is what you come here for. We'll be back, in fact Lana wants to go back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Teppan Bento was not only delicious, but it was a  culinary adventure. 9 Different In-house sauces ( I recommend the Ginger) Kevin has great front of house skills and the chef was informative. If you're not eating here its not real food."}
{"text":"We come here all the time and get the bento box with shrimp & salmon + veggies. Foods great, nice staff. Food just takes a while, but definitely worth the wait. If ordering pick up order 30 minutes"}
{"text":"Came to this small restaurant for the first time and it was super yummy. I ordered the steak and salmon Bento, the garlic butter was so delicious! I wanted even more of it. 
I also ordered the sea weed salad which was good :) 
This place also has sushi, which I'll have to try next time :) 
I recommend you come here or even order for work! This is the perfect lunch for work! 
Met the owner Kevin, super awesome guy."}
{"text":"The owner/employee was super friendly from the moment I walked in, and the food is great too. Most of the food is cooked teppanyaki style (hence the name), but they offer things like katsu and curry as well. 

I tried their oxtail soup which was very tasty and quite large, and it came with some different condiments. I also ordered a small bento.

All of the food was very tasty, and quite affordable. The portions were decent and the flavors solid.

The interior is simple. I think this is a great stop for a quick and casual but tasty meal!"}
{"text":"Food is above average for lunch 4 out of 5 stars. If you ask for water there is a small spout at the cash register, no ice available and inconvenient to get refills. I ordered fried rice which was more and only received white rice. The customers behind us got their order before us and we had been there about 5 minutes longer. Don't let them forget the sauces either. We were almost done when I asked about the sauces."}
{"text":"UPDATE 4/18 - Guess what, it's gone from sublime to sorrowful. We went tonight and were the only customers aside from a few carry out orders. One appetizer came after a half hour, one of the four diners came after 45 minutes and after ONE HOUR FIFTEEN MINUTES we told them to pack the rest to go. Sweet and embarrassed waitress said it was cook's first day but he had no trainer or manager or owner with him. Eating in the car we discovered raw shrimp and mushy salmon, waste of money and time. What a shame.


Delicious, lean, clean, flavorful food! No, you won't swear you're in a restaurant in Roppongi, but that's not the point. Go for well-prepared meat and seafood combinations served with an absolute gaggle of sauces...we had yum yum and citrus sauces for our shrimp, a teriyaki for the steak that tastes for all the world like a Japanese A-1 sauce..a decadent garlic butter that found its way onto our steak and the steamed vegetables. Service shows genuine concern for your happiness. We used the Yelp 10% offer for first timers and it was cheerfully accepted with no problems. We can't wait to return to sample more menu items!"}
{"text":"In the neighborhood today and hence decided to try it out on account of Yelp reviews. Walked in around 2:30pm and found myself to be the only customer. The only server, however, was hard at work cleaning the griddle.

I ordered hot tea, the seaweed appetizer, and the beef & shrimp combination bento. The beef was prepared to a perfect medium-rare, much to my surprise as most restaurants, including some fancy ones, tend to over cook the meat. 

Sauces were served \"on the side\" for all of my orders, including the garlic butter for the brown rice. This gave me the opportunity to try different protein/sauce combinations as well as the option to stay healthy by dialing down the sauce.    

Despite the unassuming deco, the restaurant is very clean. The menu, though simple, offers great value. Service was friendly. The icing on the cake - diligent employee when no one is watching bodes well for the consistency of quality."}
{"text":"Amazing food. I had steak and shrimp, with chicken fried rice. The fried rice is amazing as well. Wife had shrimp and chicken w veggies and steamed rice. Very good food, bill was only $28. We checked in and got a 10% yelp discount as well. The owner is a nice guy. Mama's hot sauce is excellent if you can handle spicy!! Wife loved all the different sauces. When you walk in the place smells, but I have a feeling it's from the closed up business drains next door. They share the same drains, and their drains are dried up. Don't let the smell deter you, great service, great food!!!"}
{"text":"My daughter told me about this little gem in our neighborhood, she said the owner are from Indonesia and they have Indonesian food (not on menu) every Wednesday and today I went there. She was right, food was good, great service, everybody really friendly."}
{"text":"Teppan Bento is an awesome place! I cannot ask for more. The food is delicious and the staff is really friendly. The garlic butter with the steak with fried rice is awesome and super tasty. Also, the salmon and tuna sashimi salad is really delicious. The ingredients are fresh and high quality and the serving sizes are pretty big.  I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a tasty meal!"}
{"text":"OMGGGGGGG
So much protein - so much delicious - small prices and great service!
The people who own this place and work there are so so so kind and friendly. They will introduce themselves to you and remember you when you come in. 
The steak is so delicious, it's like going to Benihana without all the ridic theatrics and high prices. The appetizers, like pot stickers and fried shrimp are also yummy. The sauces - you have to try them all - are all savory and unique. I like this place for a quick meal that tastes good, is nutritious (protein-heavy), and doesn't cost a lot."}
{"text":"The place is humble in appearance, but I don't rate based off of aesthetics. I ordered a marinated chicken and steak bento box with a chicken katsu appetizer. Everything had its own amazing flavor. I chose to get fried vs. White rice for a buck more and it was well worth it. Prices are fair for the rich quality of their food. Additionally, the staff id's incredibly friendly and make sure that you are well taken care of.

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place today for lunch and ended up coming back for dinner. For someone like me who's always on the run and can't really cook but wants to stay somewhat healthy this is the perfect place! You get your proteins, veggies and carbs. Food was freshly cooked and the workers were very nice. This is my new to go spot!"}
{"text":"We walked in thinking it was a Philly Cheesesteak place, my son and I decided to stay and order. Glad we did! The food was cooked to perfection! GREAT VALUE for the money!! Oh and the sauces were delectable. They should package them for sale!"}
{"text":"My family ordered Uber Eats from here once, it was pretty good. We ended up eating at the actual location today and we aren't coming back. I'm not going to sugar coat it, the service was terrible. 

We walk in and the lady (who I assume is part owner or something?) tells us to sit down. She asks us what drinks we want, notices that we have water bottles just says \"No drinks\" and immediately leaves. Leaving us confused if we can or cannot drink the water we brought.

We decide what to order and ding the bell on the table (a bit strange in my opinion, but the lady did say to ring it). She gives us a quick glance, serves the other table of 1, seats another table who just got there, and takes the new table's order. Then finally gets to us (a table of 4, and we had already been there for 20 mins).

She asks us what we want, we tell her as she is rushing through getting our order (and the place isn't even busy!). Most of my table asked if they could also get drinks. Her response was \"you can go get it.\"

5 mins go by and the table who came in 15 mins after us gets their food. Great. We proceed to wait another 15 mins and get our food. Each dish had problems. Also, my dad's seaweed salad never showed up and my mom's whole entree was nowhere to be found until she asked 10 mins later. The server completely forgot to tell the chefs, and it's another 10 mins to get her food. By now my mom doesn't even want it. We spent so long at this place waiting even though there were barely any customers and the orders went missing/got messed up. No wonder they were empty.

To top it all off though, when we finally get the bill the place is empty and she asks for a tip!! Nope. We usually tip well since we know what it's like to be a server. I know she was trying I guess, but not once did she at least apologize or acknowledge that she messed up multiple times. We know good service when we see it and that was far from it."}
{"text":"I called ahead of time to order for takeout. By the time I arrived about 15 minutes later, the order was ready to go! 

When I entered during peak dinner times, I noticed that it was considerably dead, but then again it was a weekday night. I appreciate that the meat is not over seasoned and could be considered to others almost bland. But they do pack you sauces on the side which I think create a perfect balance for the meat. The veggies that are grilled were cooked perfect! I wouldn't crave it, but this place might cross my mind here and there passing by."}
{"text":"this place has got the goods!! for the prices of their items on the menu you definitely get the most of your money. honestly the quality of the food here is amazing. i tried the chicken katsu bento and my gf had the angus beef w/ chicken fried rice and both were drool worthy. if you're ever in the area this spot is so worth checking out.
great customer service also, i think the owner was the one that helped us and he helped out with everything we needed and was very friendly."}
{"text":"I totally dig this place... It's near a place I need to be weekly and whether it's a snack, late lunch or dinner to take home... I have not been disappointed. The price is right... And the quality is on point! I've had the steak, squid, and my son goes crazy for the potstickers which I'll be honest-there are far better... But for a protein fix, a teppan meal, steak... I recommend. The chef also cooks at Bar Masa at Aria, with that being said he understand quality and during the days he's often there being the little chef ninja. They have a few different sauces - the typical traditional ones and this garlic butter dip... My goodness it's good but clearly not healthy and that's ok because it's so damn good! The staff is super friendly here and do their best to remember their customers which is nice to see/feel. Go Chef Ninja!"}
{"text":"This place is really good, and fairly priced. Our chef came out and asked us if everything was to our satisfaction and was very friendly. This place is kind of hidden, at first you wouldn't notice it unless you were in the shopping center, but I am glad we checked it out. It has a sort of mom and pop feel to it. Their house made sauces are amazing and everything was on point. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars overall

It's always nice seeing family owned restaurants around town. The staff is super friendly and truly wants you to enjoy their food. 

My boyfriend and I started with chicken and shrimp fried gyoza. They weren't bad but not memorable. I ordered the chicken and beef bento box with brown rice and my boyfriend got the shrimp and beef bento with fried rice. Since it was our first time there, they gave us all of their sauces to try and gave recommendations for which sauce went well with which meat. 

The best part of the meal were the sauces. My favorites were the yumyum sauce (creamy and tangy) and a spicy sauce, which had flavors reminiscent of Thai cuisine. And if you like garlic, the garlic butter/dip that comes with each bento was delicious as well. 

The food wasn't bad but I'm not sure if it's something I would be craving and coming back for."}
{"text":"After having a lazy Saturday, we decided to keep the lazy going and found this place on UberEATS. I ordered the chicken and beef combo. My husband ordered the beef and shrimp combo. Overall, the food was good. The meat had a good flavor, the veggies were yummy, and my husband loved the fried rice. We'd definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"One of my favourite things on Yelp is collecting the different badges. I wish, however, I could give a badge to this place. Teppan Bento definitely deserves the \"Hidden Gem\" badge, because this place is fantastic. 

I love supporting mom and pop shops too, but it's even better when you get to patronize them because they're great and not just because you're tired of the big guy. Teppan Bento is run by a son and his aunt, uncle, and mother. Total small time establishment.

I ordered the Chicken and Salmon bento, and my girlfriend ordered the steak and shrimp bento with chicken fried rice. We also got a gyoza appetizer. It was a lot more food than I had anticipated. We both split all the food and tried everything. I'd break down the food as following:

-steak 5/5
-chicken 4/5
-shrimp 5/5
-salmon 5/5
-gyoza 3/5
-chicken fried rice 5/5
-vegetable side 5/5

All the food was delicious, but especially the steak. It was cooked perfect. Also, their copious amounts of dipping sauces were amazing. My favourites were the mustard sauce and yum yum sauce. 

If you're in town and looking for some good teppanyaki-esque food, or just a good bento lunch/dinner, you HAVE to give this place a try. You would definitely be missing out if you didn't come here. 





Would I come back here myself??? You bet your chopsticks I will.

Would I recommend this place to others??? In a heartbeat."}
{"text":"We moved further away had to drive about 30 miles to get back, but well worth it. We had the shrimp, salmon, and chicken, and they were fabulous. The chef really knows how to cook. The fried shrimp had so much flavor. However they batter them they're crispy and juicy, and taste so fresh. The salmon is always cooked to perfection, so tender and the spices the chef uses are so tasty. The chicken is grilled and seasoned to perfection. I never thought I could enjoy chicken as I do here. The food here is equivalent to a 5 star upscale restaurant at 25% of the price. To get the same quality somewhere else you would easily be spending triple. And the service, THE BEST!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and I'm so glad I did! 
Ordered the Ahi Tuna Steak with white rice and various veggies and was absolutely amazing. The Yum Yum house sauce they served was my favorite. Service and price was great, would definitely come back again to try everything else"}
{"text":"Only open for a less then two weeks this place is a GEM!!! Delicious menu items, good prices and fantastically happy staff!! I will defiantly recommend this place to others!!"}
{"text":"Budget and nutrition-plan friendly! I'm happy to know that in a world where we run all day, spending a majority of our time driving in the car, there is a place where I can get restaurant quality food in fast-food service time. I wouldn't say it's spectacular but it is good, quality, healthy food in a nice atmosphere. Not to mention the excellent service. My only real \"issue\" would be that there is a lot of waste with the plastic bento boxes. I would love to see the orders that are not to-go, to be served in a less wasteful, more Eco-conscious container. I will probably be back quite often when I'm on this side of town, and I wish these guys all the best. Stop in and check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Definitely give this place a try! They're very attentive, the food is yummy, the portions are good, and I know we'll be back!! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Came in around 8 pm and was looking for some great eats. I asked the owner if my son could get something like a sushi roll with eel sauce for my son and he was very accommodating with a shrimp tempura roll that was super fresh and delicious. I ordered a calamari steak and beef steak combo medium rare and they both came out so tender and flavorful. Just perfect with a side of vegetables and brown rice and that amazing garlic butter. Everything was super delicious although it did take a little bit of time to prepare but after that it was entirely worth the wait. Wonderful dinner and very nice people there."}
{"text":"My wife decided to pick up dinner and noticed this place nestled in the fresh and easy parking lot. I myself have never experienced anything like this but from what she tells me these places are big in Japan. With that said I must say this place is really good and authentic I was speaking to the owner asking him why the steak is so tender and he replied that he uses only prime beef which explains why it is perfect every time this is a perfect example of a small business struggling to start up in America they need all the support from local foodies like us."}
{"text":"The steak was awesome and the fish is really fresh. The sauce is all really good and the garlic butter is amazing. The staff is very friendly, would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We are not from the area and we were starving and driving around trying to find a spot to eat. We decided on this place and I'm so glad we did! The food was very flavorful! The waiter was so friendly and even put in Disney music for the kids! Definitely would recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"So, we were tired of the strip, and wanted a local place. 
We found this one. The owner and his sous chef are the nicest people. 
In addition, he suggested what was freshest and best this evening, and we took him up on it. 

They use wild caught Scottish Salmon...really fresh and just plain wonderful.

We are so glad we had dinnner here....
As another reviewer stated, this is a hidden gem. 

We experienced excellent service, and had a great time. 

Please note this is a super casual place....with amazing food. 

Hey Las Vegas, this is the type of local place you should all embrace."}
{"text":"Clean, tasty, and cheap food! Couldn't ask for a nicer place and friendly workers. I saw this place as I was going to Fresh & Easy and had to try it. 

First thing I noticed is how clean it is. The menu is pretty basic so they stick to just a few items for the Bento box. Everyone welcomes you as you walk in and I think it's a husband, wife, and son who run the place. I always try to support family owned businesses. We take a seat and run through the menu, I decide on the marinated chicken and steak combo with two scoops of veggies and only one scoop of rice. All drinks are either canned, bottled, or water from a cooler; sorry no soda fountain found here. The food comes out shortly and is fresh and tasty. Portions are decent but nothing large. Flavor is good and steak also comes with this sauce with a kick which is a nice touch. After our meal we are offered some shaved ice on the house and the pina colada is the best tasting one. Nice meal and for $10.80 a plate I really can't complain at all. I was full but no left overs to take home. Definitely will be coming back for another round."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and fell In love. The food is perfect as well as all the sauces that go with the dish . Highly recommend this place to everyone . And the best part about it . I've had One of the best customer service experience!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little spot with great food and service. I went in for the first time and I was greeted right away and offered any help with making decisions from the menu. For starters my brother, sis and I got the gyosas, shrimp tempura, and calamari. For the main meal I got chicken and calamari and it comes with white rice, and veggies. The flavors were great. There are several sauces to choose from which were all delicious too. And they also have a garlic paste u can smear on over your food! Mmmm... Check it out! One side ways thumb for the fact that they don't have much to choose from to drink. Your choices are canned drinks from a small fridge. No biggie for me since they had coconut water!"}
{"text":"The magic has disappeared from this place. Used to be one of my favorite spots to come for lunch or dinner but not anymore. I came in for lunch other day and the light wasn't even turned on. I thought I wandered into the Twilight Zone. I ordered two steak and shrimp bentos to go & it literally took the cook 35 minutes to prepare my order. The steak was not tender and the shrimp tasted very bland. Dang what happened to this place? For a meal that almost cost $30 I felt totally ripped off, the quality was poor & they don't give you much food here anymore. Never again.

Poor service
Poor quality food
Tiny portions

So not worth it. Severely disappointed in this place and what is has become."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I had the Chicken Katsu bento with fried rice and was treated to the fluffiest, most delicious rice I've ever had. The chicken? Amazing. Perfectly cooked.

This lunch made me a better person.

Thank you, Teppan Bento."}
{"text":"I loved their customer services!! Excellent!! I love mom's spicy sauce!!! Owner's mom was very sweet and friendly."}
{"text":"We got couple orders to go orders and got 1 steak & salmon bento and the salmon was not cooked fully.   Instead of go back and complain we just decided to recook it ourselves.   The veggies were awful and not like other photos posted.   Wish it was either a salad or fresh veggies like others posted.  The steak was tasty.   
Probably will not be back."}
{"text":"A quick grab-n-go meal that was delish! 
We ordered ribeye steak, chicken breast, calamari, gyoza, shrimp tempura, salmon and lots of fried rice. Everything was so delicious. See you tonight Tepan Bento"}
{"text":"We enjoy Volcano Grill so when we saw a restaurant in my Mom's hood that seemed very similar to Volcano Grills concept we knew we had to give it a try. First we were disapointed that there was no sauce bar in which we could get our own sauces. It says on the menu that your bento includes 2 sauces of your choice but after being spoiled by Volcano Grills - get your own sauces & get as much as you like picking 2 sauces seems stingy. However, if you ask the server for more, he'll glady get you more. But who really wants to keep asking the server for more sauces anyways. Ok on to the food - The steak was tender & I do like the extra touch of smearing garlic butter on the steak. The chicken fried rice & chicken breast just were not exciting at all. The chicken was bland. And yes I know we have lots of sauces to choose from here but I think the food should be seasoned on its own. The rice in the fried rice were broken- I don't like seeing that, I want my rice in tact. I'm picky about my rice ok! The shrimp tempura was plump but overcooked. The decor is meh, nothing to write home about. The grilled veggies is a winner. All the sauces were right on with the yum yum sauce having a lemony taste to it. Would I go out of my way to make a trek down to the Silverado Ranch area to eat here again probably not but people living in this area should definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"I ordered the salmon and shrimp bento with fried rice. So good! Shrimp was fresh and flavorful. Salmon was well cooked. Seafood came with a ginger sauce which was great on the salmon. 

My friend got the calamari and chicken bento with fried rice. He loved the chicken, which was tender and had great flavor. The calamari was pretty tender. 
 
Fried rice comes with chicken which we were not informed of. I don't eat chicken so I had to pick it out of my rice. Inconvenient but customer service and food made up for it."}
{"text":"Excellent service! Friendly staff. It was a very welcoming environment and has good selections of food."}
{"text":"This place is the Bomb. Came for dinner with the family and had the Chicken Katsu. The great thing about the way they make it is that it's breast meat and not thigh. It's still juicy and tender with a perfect crispy coating. The best part are the sauces for dipping. The spicy mayo sauce is just the right amount of spicy and sweet. The service is great for take out or dine in. The owner is often there cooking for you. We will be back again for sure. I will be a regular here!"}
{"text":"While on the lookout for a new lunch place to try, I came across Teppan Bento here on Yelp. The ratings and reviews did not lie! Delicious food, very friendly, attentive and helpful staff! I am also a big fan of condiments, and they have sauces to pair with anything! They bring over a tray and explain which sauces they are giving you and what they go with in your meal. Will absolutely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"Great little gem in the Fresh & Easy plaza. I had the chicken and salmon bento with mixed veggies and rice. The salmon was cooked to perfection. The chicken, tender and juicy. They provide plenty of homemade dipping sauces which are all quite flavorful, each with its own unique taste! If you're in the mood for Japanese bento, check this place out!"}
{"text":"I dined in instead of take out. The service was super awesome. Definitely get the ginger and the mustard sauce. The food was delicious and it was a great little place for dinner on a Friday night!! Delicious."}
{"text":"I wish I had the experience everyone else seems to have. I was really looking forward to trying teppan as I have never had teppanyaki. I went with my girl friend and it was strange to say the least. Menus in the front but booths to sit so I didn't know if we put in an order at the register or the table. 

I did use the free gyoza appetizer by checking in. The chicken ones were average. Oddly enough, they smelled like McDonalds french fries. We ordered a shrimp and chicken combo bento box with fried rice. We had full intentions to get another order if we were still hungry but we didn't even finish half of the first one. They also serve water in red solo cups?? What??

When I bit the shrimp I could feel the puncture of the skin and the squishy texture. Most of them still had the feces line. The chicken was fatty and had a weird taste. 

The man who took our order was really sweet at first but did not say goodbye or that he appreciates the constructive Criticism when I told him it was not good. I did not mean it to be offensively and I'm sorry you saw it that way. I believe there is always room for growth, especially when you work in the food industry."}
{"text":"One of the absolute best To-Go orders I have EVER feasted on. Well...whether I rushed home or ate at the restaurant-my orders were superb quality!  
This place is about 5 minutes from home in the Fresh & Easy shopping plaza on Silverado Ranch & Bermuda. I have passed this placed for months wondering. Now I wonder how It took me this long to try! 
We were too lazy to cook one night and read of all the reviews so decided we'd give it a try. Cute couple greeted us nicely at the door and mentioned the specials on their board and if we'd ever eaten there. We explained it was our first time and he went on to explain the quality, and sauces and that he suggested the steak. 
I really wanted to try the Ahi steak and ribeye steak, so my boyfriend and I ordered 1 Bento of each. He let us know we could dine in even as it was closing up soon. But we didn't want to bother them and wanted to just rush home. We sat for a bit as the wife I guess clarified the available sauces that were their own homemade recipes so I asked if we could try them all. 
Our order was cooked quickly, packed neatly and with all the utensils and additional sauces requested. They even packed us an extra Chicken Fried Rice order. 
We got home, and dug in! FIRST bite was phenomenal! The medium steak was premium quality, juicy and tender. Vegetables were not over or under cooked. Mixed with the chicken fried rice, I swear I felt like I was sitting at a teppanyaki grill with the chef right in front. We scarfed down both orders quietly as we tried each sauce. I loved the ginger sauce. The spicy mayo with the ahi has more kick than I expected.
Service was so welcoming, food was top notch and portions are heavier than they look. Our meal came up to about $32+/- pre-tip for 2 full meals and I swear ever dollar was worth it."}
{"text":"What I love about this place that outshines a lot of other restaurants is that welcome. Being greeted by the entire staff like a good pal that has finally come back home. Now this is based off of my own individual experiences but nonetheless these are very nice people running an honest to God business.

Interior: Fairly open with maybe 7-8 tables so if it's not busy please take a seat, they will bring you all sorts of sauces to try and just chat, they like to get to know the customers that are visiting their establishment.

Food: I love their salmon which is personally selected by the chef/owner every week. Sometimes there is no salmon and I respect that.. why? because he refuses to compromise with his ingredients. He loses money potentially by not having that dish but there are still other great options. I really like their marinated chicken, very tasty and super tender. The steak is also a good option and ask to have it with the garlic butter its fantastic. The food is incredibly fresh and also a great healthy alternative.

Service: A+ 

Overall: fair prices, friendly service, and quality ingredients. Also in an area where good food is hard to come by. My new favorite restaurant"}
{"text":"First time at Teppan Bento and the food is the BEST!  The grilled salmon was done to perfection, the selection of sauces was a treat, and the pot stickers were delicious.  I wish I was a person who went on and on about things but I'm more of a 'get to the point' person...sooooooo drive from anywhere in the valley and you will be pleased BECAUSE the food is so well prepared.  It's a family business and they want to please.  I'll be back in a few days."}
{"text":"It seems I am forever on a low carb diet and I am always on the hunt to find new places to try that is heavy on the protein. Teppan Bento is a Atkins Lovers Dream!

Steak, Shrimp, Salmon and Chicken were all seasoned and cooked perfectly. The garlic butter he includes in so addicting and the perfect accompaniment with the shrimp. My favorite sauce is the Ginger by far, tastes great on the Steak and Chicken. I haven't tried the Ribeye yet as it seems a little high on price but will probably give it a shot soon. 

Its really nice to find a new healthy place that is not only very tasty but its fast, reasonably priced and the owner is a total sweetheart! He has gone out of his way to make sure we have a great meal and experience. I hope this place sticks around!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb!!! Great quality food that they cook fresh. Yummy sauces too!! They are so nice!! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"It's a cute little bento place. Inside they had booths and you can sit where the chef is cooking. I ordered the steak lunch with additional charge for fried rice and my friend got the chicken and steak combo. He cooks it right after you order so it's nice and fresh. My steak came with veggies. Flavor was good on the steak. It was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. The veggies were ok. I wish they had asparagus. The fried rice was good but nothing special to me. Overall my meal was good. There was more fried rice than anything else in the bento box so I would suggest less rice and more steak and veggies to balance the bento box out. Prices were cheap and affordable too."}
{"text":"Just sat down and already like the place! Here on business and my iPhone was getting out of juice. They nicely allowed me to use their charger and plug in to charge, that's great customer service!"}
{"text":"We found this restaurant on yelp with high ratings so we checked it out. They have a lunch and dinner menu serving sushi as well. Not a lot to choose from on the menu, which I love!! The environment was a little hole in the wall restaurant with amazing service. We walked in and the owner, Kevin, immediately greeted us and brought us to our table. The prices are reasonable between $7 & $12. We  had 3 different types of sushi, a chicken noodle dish and a chicken bento from the kids menu. Yes, there's a kid menu :) I love when restaurants consider the kids too! The food was tasty and delicious! There was no dessert menu. However, the owner was quick to offer an ice cream dish for the inconvenience. We thought that was awesome! We'll definitely be back when we need to get a quick fix of bento and sushi! Would love to see some baked sushi on the menu as well as a separation between cooked and uncooked sushi. Other than that, we recommend this place for your sushi and bento fix. Great place to go when you're pressed for time as well. Service was quick. Thank you, Kevin! It was a pleasure to meet you! Your service was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Delicious place to stop in for a quick lunch. The marinated chicken and calamari I ordered were both delicious and I especially enjoyed it with the included ginger sauce. Getting calamari cooked just right to be tender is no easy task so I commend the chef on doing ab great job. 

I do recommend calling in your order ahead of time if you're in a rush since it did take about 10-15 to get my food and that was with no one else ahead of me. I was in no rush so it didn't matter to me. 

Also, don't expect much in terms of ambiance or show like other Teppanyaki places. This is more of a bento place where your food happens to be cooked on a teppan. Delicious food but not the same experience (also not the high prices!)"}
{"text":"Bomb lunch bentos. Had the steak medium. Was cooked perfectly. Guys in there were really nice and fast. Only thing I'm not a huge ginger person. There ginger dressing. Is well super ginger. But if that's your type of dressing go for it. I'm not going to mark them off on something I'm biased about. Everything else was really good. And that orange sauce was crack. I put it on the steak and rice. Lol I'm definitely coming back for those combo boxes!"}
{"text":"This is your hole in the wall mom and pop shop with quality food, customer attentiveness at a reasonable price.

Ambiance: casual mom and pop, pizzeria furniture. Overall clean and well lit. 

Food Quality: OMG yes. It tastes great and they don't skimp on inferior quality. When it comes to the meat they don't go with cheap cuts. 

Price: There are more economic options down the street, but it won't be this quality or service."}
{"text":"HIGHLY RECOMMEND...Great family run business. Food was great! Recommend the steak with mustard sauce. Kids loved the katsu chicken and yakisoba noodles...Don't forget to order your shaved ice!"}
{"text":"Great service!!! The guys are very nice and the food is fresh and tastes great.... OMG the spicy mayo is yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try a gyoza and I had a coupon for free gyoza. When I went there, they told me that I have to purchase something to use the coupon, but the coupon does not say anything about a purchase required. Additionally, one of my friends have tried the same coupon before and it worked and he is the one who gave me this coupon to try their food. False advertising. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"To put it simply, everything we had was the bomb . I had the beef steak bento box and it was deeelicious. The steak was tender and cooked perfectly and was served with this amazing garlic butter. Yummmmm!!!! My sisters and my mom had the katsu chicken and they said it was some of the best they've ever had. And the sauces were all good too. Of course there was the garlic butter, but i also liked the spicy yumyum sauce and there was a gingery-maybe wasabi type sauce that was really good too. Overall, i had a good experience. Good food, and the service was excellent! I will definitely be coming back the next time i come to vegas"}
{"text":"Amazing food and extremely polite staff. Had the steak and calamari bento combination and it was amazing! Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Tried this place out for the first time today. It was speedy, excellent, and the fried rice was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I had a nice experience at Teppan Bento.  This place has been open just a month and is a casual place to enjoy the same flavors you could get at a teppanyaki restaurant for a good price and less time.  I met one of the owners, Kevin, who walked me through the menu.

I chose the combo bento with calamari and steak.  I asked about the tofu steak and learned it is being phased out of the menu.  When the chef heard me discuss it, he offered to make me the tofu steak on the house since it is going away.

I tried 4 sauces - the house made chipotle hot sauce, the garlic hot sauce, gyoza sauce, and ginger sauce, and got steamed rice with my bento.  The bento came with veggies (onions, carrots, and zucchini).  I really enjoyed the meal - everything was cooked perfectly and tasted very well-seasoned.  I was able to order my steak cooked the way I prefer.  The sauces complimented everything.  Ginger sauce goes very well with the veggies.  The bento also came with garlic butter to flavor the proteins.

The bento also included a drink, so I found it to be a very good deal.  I would definitely recommend a stop here for a tasty meal!"}
{"text":"Food is Fresh and cooked to order.  The chef recommended the salmon and the angus beef. Very tasty! Also ordered a chicken katsu kids bento for my daughter. Portions big.. She loved it!   Happy tummy happy mommy! I will  definetly be
back!"}
{"text":"We ordered the steak and salmon with fried rice bento and the marinated chicken bento. The steak and salmon were both great. I loved the salmon with the yummy sauce and the steak with the garlic butter and the ginger sauce. The marinated chicken had a slight BBQ flavor, but I think I would have been more satisfied with just the plain chicken to dip in all the sauces. We live right and the area and will definitely be coming back. We still love going to Musashi's down on paradise, but this place is close to as good at a quarter of the price."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! I get the ribeye steak bento box and my hubby gets the steak and shrimp or salmon and it's super fresh and affordable! The sweet older lady that works there gives you ice water as you sit to wait for your takeout! The best part is, is that it's right around the corner from our home and we can't find anything as good as this place close by. I highly recommend at least trying it! 5 Starz for me!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were starving, and decided to check this place out since it's pretty close to where we live. We were greeted and served right away. The restaurant was family-owned, cute, and REALLY clean! I ordered a bento with chicken and shrimp, which also came with veggies and white rice. I really liked how the chicken and shrimp were cooked, like teppanyaki style. It reminds me of a Bennihana, but definitely much more cheaper and delicious. Before our entrees came in, the owner gave us some free samples of meatballs they were thinking about adding to the menu. You could tell they really care about their customer's opinion, as they kept asking my boyfriend and I to critique the meatballs. All in all, they provide excellent customer service and food that's worth your dollar. Definitely going back! :)"}
{"text":"Bento boxes are very flavorful. Not overpowering marinated meats like some places. I did like the dipping sauces on the side, which is a nice touch. The sushi rolls are also spot on with quality. This places uses fresh ingredients and it is truly made to order. The prices are good for the quality of the food. Please remember it is very hard for small mom and pop restaurants to keep the food costs (especially meat or fish) down because they can't mass order from the suppliers like the chain restaurants. Get the fried rice on the side. 

Another hidden gem. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Solid, hearty, quick, and satisfying. Friendly service. Only knock was I really wanted to try the calamari steak, and they were out. 

Katsu Bento: **** typical Katsu. Sauce was good. Chicken fried rice option was good. Veggies were cooked perfectly. 
Steak and Shrimp (wanted it to be calamari here) Combo Bento: Steak: ***** tender and delicious, though ordered MR and got MW, but expected that since we got take out, garlic sauce was key here (could eat gobs of that stuff). Shrimp: *** meh. Not really much to write home about, especially since I had calamari steak on the mind. Steamed rice was nice. Veggies, again cooked perfectly. Seaweed Salad: ***** order it everywhere, and Very good here. Crisp, lovingly dressed, just enough sesame seeds. I'd do an order of that, steak a la carte, and the garlic sauce every night, and be totally happy

Also tried the yum sauce: kinda lemony; hot mustard: not too hot; poke sauce: wanted poke when I tried it; chipotle mayo: got some heat here! 

CANNOT wait to try the calamari steak next time. So for that we will return!"}
{"text":"Really good food.  We entered and were greeted imidiately.   Ordered kinda basic for our first time, just in case.  I had steak and chicken breast my girl had teriyaki chicken.  Loved the yum yum sauce!  Will become a regular.  The prices are really afordable and food exceeds the cost of the meal."}
{"text":"My daughter and I were hungry and thinking about where to eat. We Yelped for places in the area and found Teppan Bento, never heard of it and wasn't sure where it could be located. Near Fresh n Easy but we've seen all the places in that area.....Teppan Bento had replaced the old Philly Steak place. 

The lady owner greeted us at the register and asked if this was our first time there. She went over the menu and we decided to sit down and figure out what to order. I ordered the Katsu double protein plate and my daughter end ordered the beef steak plate. We also ordered the shrimp tempura for appetizer\" we weren't sure as to what sauces to order, so the owner brought all the sauces for us to try. My favorites are the mustard and ginger sauces. All sauces are homemade and so good, the chicken Katsu was crispy crunchy and not oily or greasy at all. The shrimp tempura was like fried shrimp and ver crunchy as well. The beef steak my daughter ordered was good without too much seasoning as you would use the sauces for dipping the meat in. The mustard sauce goes very well with the steak. We both had a lot of food left over enough for another meal.

Did I mention the owner brought us an order of seaweed salad to try on the house? Yes!!!

We were pleasantly surprised and Teppan Bento its definitely worth coming back to. I think I'll try the calamari steak next time with a side of chicken Katsu. Can't wait! 

I forgot to mention that there is a water cooler for those who prefer water instead of soda. Perfectly!

See you soon Teppan Bento!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the service was great! Definitely a must try. We had the calamari and the chicken katsu and both were tender.  The garlic butter was orgasmic.  The place is clean and they have good ventilation so you don't smell like the food."}
{"text":"The service was super friendly and the food was tasty! The food was cooked fresh and homemade, not 'commercial.' I ordered the bento box with extra teriyaki chicken and he had the two-item bento combo of salmon and chicken. Both came with this really amazing garlic butter. We also ordered the combo gyoza and seaweed salad. The gyoza was cooked perfectly, and sauce for it was just right. The seaweed salad was served with this yummy sesame dressing, something we had not had at other places. There was so much food that we took the leftovers to-go. The fun part is they gave us a plastic lid for the bento box to take home.

They also brought a choice of teas -- not fancy tea, but rather tea bag packets -- and we were offered all choices to keep. Some places charge per serving. 

The chef, and the lady who might have been a sous chef/server, made us feel welcome and everything we ordered came promptly, with a smile.

We dined here for the first time tonight and it was a good experience. We have lived down the street for years, but for some reason never knew it was here. It's in a strip mall that seems to market to the Asian-minded consumer. There's a tea place nearby and an Asian grocery market a few doors down. Also a Thai restaurant and a a Tae Kwon Do place. Although the ambiance isn't romantic/relaxing (lighting is a bit bright and decor could be updated a little), the good food and service is enough to bring us back again. I hear the Oxtail Ramen soup is a good dish to try!"}
{"text":"Solid five stars.  Found this place off Yelp.  Im from Los Angeles and anytime I'm in the area I'll definitely stop by.  Think of a Benihana but cheaper but actually taste better.  Quality of meat is up there too.  The owner is probably the nicest owner you'll ever meet.  Service is on par with a five star restaurant.

No joke, the food is spectacular and the customer service is unbelievable for a fast food or to go place.

Don't be fooled by the reviews you can sit down and dine in if you want.  I had the chicken and steak and it was done perfectly.  The sauces are good but the garlic butter is off the charts.  Definitely get the fried rice as well.

Awesome place, will come back when I have the chance!!!"}
{"text":"Kevin, the owner/operator, is AWESOME! I honestly didn't know what to expect at this restaurant as the bento box quick service concept is new to me. THIS PLACE IS AWESOME! They have all these yummy sauces and different combo boxes! Customer service, food, and atmosphere is on point and delicious! I will definitely be back! :D"}
{"text":"We came in today- second day of opening. I am generally iffy about quick bento places because the quality tends to suffer. This place was outstanding. The food was phenomenal. And the service was super friendly, almost like you were going to a good friends house for dinner!
We ordered some steak, teriyaki chicken, rock shrimp and chicken katsu and never once were we disappointed. Their special dipping sauces were full of flavor, but you didn't even need them because the meat was seasoned perfectly. I've eaten at all different places including expensive Japanese steakhouses and this food is just as mouth watering as any $$$ place, but this place won't break the bank. I can't wait to come back and try it again. If I could , I'd give it a 10!!"}
{"text":"1st time here yesterday to try it out & back again today to get more. Got the steak & salmon bento & it's so delicious. The steak is cooked the way you prefer it. The salmon is so good!!! Friendly staff!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why they have good ratings just $$$$ plane old Chinese Food and not very good very,very salty"}
{"text":"Try the oxtail soup! Broth is very good and flavorful.  California hotel puts a little more meat and is a little cheaper but Teppan Bento serves this all day and the broth is better imo."}
{"text":"Came here today with my friends. An definitely 10 out of 10 for service and food. Was absolutely wonderful definitely recommend to anyone looking for tasty homemade food. Super friendly too. I'm excited for my next trip back here!!!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible.  Not only did they mess up on my our order but they had ants that fell into our cups when we went to refill our drinks!  Calling dirty dining on this place!"}
{"text":"This place is a must !!!!! The ginger sauce and mustard sauce is so yummy!!! I'm def coming back here again !!!"}
{"text":"Ordered combo shrimp and Angus beef bento.  Was NOT satisfied at all.  Beef was well done and cut into very tiny pieces.  Shrimp was small.  I guess you get what you pay for.   Smh.  Fried rice for an addl charge want even worth it.  Not your typical teppan grill taste.   Sorry but it was horrible."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I had salmon and steak and my wife had steak and chicken. Let's just say we had no leftovers. All the sauces were great and the vegetables that come with it are great! Service was also very good and friendly. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"We were on vacation in Las Vegas and the only food we knew our whole family would agree on was Japanese food.  My husband found Teppan Bento on yelp and was impressed that it had such a high rating and so many great reviews. 

There are so many things I like about this place.  First, the ambiance.  It is a small, quaint establishment with nice acoustic music playing in the background (music like what you'd expect at a coffeehouse with live performers).  Next, the menu has just enough selection (not too many choices and not too little).   The service was a bit slow (and we were REALLY hungry), but all was forgiven once we were served.  I ordered the bento box with marinated chicken and calamari.  I have never in my life had calamari that was so fresh.  In fact, all of their ingredients seemed to be top notch (the only downside was my vegetables were cold...but still tasted great).  If you are a fan of ginger, be sure to request the ginger sauce; it complements the calamari nicely.

On finishing our meal, the chef came out and asked us how we enjoyed our food.  I really like it when the chef takes interest in how well received their dishes are.  Of course, we told him how much we enjoyed it! 

Our server was also very polite and attentive to our needs.  On our next trip to Vegas, we will definitely be stopping here for a meal!

Thanks, Teppan Bento!!"}
{"text":"I am gonna give this place a 3.5 star and so for this review, I have upped it or rounded it off to 5 star.

1.  Service - Fantastic. The chef and the waitress of this family style restaurant are very nice, friendly, and very good cooks.  I enjoyed their personal touch and accommodating whatever we needed, including asking tons of questions being our first time.

2.  Ambiance - Interesting. This place feels more like a fast food establishment although it has plenty of seats and benches.  There is no problem with parking at this strip mall. On a Saturday at 6:15 pm, we were the only ones at the restaurant, although within 30 minutes, there were quite a few more.

3.  The food- Interesting.  The food is served in disposable containers that are like  small bento boxes.  When I say small, I mean that they  seem to be about 70% the size of a normal bento box. It is also a bit shallower as well.

a. Calamari and Salmon - Very tasty calamari and tender overall considering it is not fried or breaded.  However, there was very little of it. I would say 2-3 ounces.  The salmon was very tasty and just that it was such a small portion. Again, 2-3 ounces and fairly thin.  I like thick portions of salmon.  Rice, and some other tidbits rounded out this meal and it was good.

b.  Teriyaki Beef and Chicken Katsu - the wifey had this one and the beef was good and the katsu was very, very thin.  Normally I like a very juicy piece of chicken and you can bite into the delicate katsu, with the right amount of crunchiness and then you get all the juicy bits of chicken.  This was thin, crunchy and easy to eat, just not what I was expecting.

c.  Tuna Poke - Our friends had this and I did not try it.  Although, you get a lot of poke mixed in the salad.  Looked good to me!

d.  Drinks are served in small 8 oz plastic disposable tumblers.  It was okay.  We had water.

The people are GREAT, the food tasty, I guess I may have been slightly underwhelmed by the pricing.  I have had teppanyaki style at many places and so you definitely are getting teppanyaki at half the price.  You are also getting a lot less in size and ounces too though.  

Eating say, Hawaiian plate food in disposable dishes seems to be okay and I guess it is because you get a heapin full of really good and tasty food. Here, the disposable dishes and the small servings kind of made everything feel a bit...well underwhelmed.

I was truly surprised by all the 5 star reviews and this place being the best and tastiest.  I may have to go back as I am totally not convinced at this time.

GK says, worth to check it out and inexpensive overall."}
{"text":"What a cool concept! I love how I can get in and out ! So delicious and cheap! Perfect for lunch or dinner! Open late and has sushi as well !!!! Check it out !!!!!"}
{"text":"I eat here at least 3x a week

Shrimp and chicken with fried rice

The garlic butter and the pink sauce is real good

Best fast food in the area takes about 10min to order and get your food and its a good price only 13$"}
{"text":"If you know what Teppan-yaki is then you have probably frequented a Benihana's establishment at some point or another. You may have experienced the wonder that is known as the \"volcano,\" or been lucky enough to witness the \"train,\" and this may lead you to believe that you know something about Teppan-yaki - but take it from a former vet in the Teppan-yaki game (I worked at Benihana's in HS from 96-97), Teppan Bento is legit. 

Don't let me mislead you...there are no chefs putting on a spectacle of chicken fried rice mounds and shrimp tails flying gracefully through the air here, but when you really get to thinking about it, isn't that the extra you're paying more for to somehow justify the $25 price tag for a \"meal-and-show?\"

You will definitely not pay the extra at Teppan Bento but you will get all of the delicious food that would have accompanied the flare - shrimp, marinated chicken, some delicious squid and Black Angus steak all cooked up to your liking with an army of sauces to choose from, served with grilled veggies and rice. I was partial to both the Garlic and Mustard sauces but there were several others. Oh yeah and don't forget the garlic butter - slather it on that meat!

Other reviewers were on point - the Chicken Katsu is some good eats. Simple and delicious. My young, rambunctious son who eats up Chicken Katsu was appeased so it had to be good. 

They just opened about a week ago and were working out a few kinks but the owners' level of customer service was obviously apparent - my wife even said it was \"like we were family!\" Although to my wife, everyone is like family :) 

Bottom line - good, healthy and quick eats at a great price. I can totally see myself picking this up for my family, especially the kids, or as a meal before or after a workout (maybe add brown rice to the menu?), or just to nosh on myself when I'm working late. Great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem. Really enjoyed the food, the shrimp was very good and instead of white rice in our box he let us swap it for fried rice which was delicious!!"}
{"text":"I have had nothing but a great experience in this restaurant. Every time I have come in here the chef and the cashier have been some of the friendliest people I've ever met, even going as far to remember our names."}
{"text":"VERY friendly staff, family owned. Exceptional service! We arrived just after opening and were seated immediately :-D

Tried shrimp gyoza... disappointing. :-( 

Spicy mayo sauce & poke sauce are unremarkable...

GINGER SAUCE IS DELISH on everything!

Ordered Shrimp and Salmon Bento Box and Chicken Yakisoba. Fish was prepared just right,  Shrimp good with garlic butter and a squeeze of lime. Enough food to bring home for another light meal.

Deserves 3.5 stars. Yum!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I went to get a quick bite to eat and that's our new favorite place to go food and service are great!! We love the garlic butter I need a tub of that stuff"}
{"text":"Okay so I have been wanting to try this place for a while now and finally got around to it. Lets just say the food was worth the wait--over a 40 minute wait. Since the guy whom took our order and his assistant were very nice im going to let the wait time slide as well as the fact that my order was missing an item as clearly the place was short staffed on the night of my visit. 

I ordred the pork katsu and the caterpillar roll. The pork katsu met my expectations. It was fried perfectly and the breding was light and flaky as you'd expect with this dish. meat wasnt try and the katsu sauce of course was fine as well.

Catepillar roll was actually really good. the fish tasted fresh and I personally found with each bite the flavor to be superb. 

My friends ordered a steak bento and let me tell you their entree takes the win. Steak was super tender and savory.


so finaly suggestion: give this local spot a try"}
{"text":"I am shocked!! I don't understand how this place gets good reviews. The service is horrible you are ignored when you walk in. It took forever to order our food we were busy fanning them down to our table. They act like they are so busy when they were only two tables that needed attention. I ordered the Katsu bento and that was terrible with the chicken fried rice . I have no words to describe how horrible the order was. My friend ordered the salmon bento and she herself was dissatisfied with the order. On top of that we ordered appetizer the steam gyoza which came right after we finished our food. We said heck no we do. It want that it's too late ! That should have came right before our bento boxes came. Oh and by the way our order did not even come in a bento box, even though it stayed lunch special bento box. It came in a bowel. This place put a bad taste in our mouth .. yuck!!"}
{"text":"Teppanyaki without the corny tricks served bento style. 

Protein choices: steak, chicken, salmon, shrimp, ahi, and calamari.

Entree options consist of a combination of 2 or 1 selection double protein. Each bento comes with rice and veggies and choice of 2 sauces. 

- ginger sauce* 
- mustard sauce
- teriyaki sauce
- bbq sauce 
- katsu sauce 
- yum yum sauce*
- spicy mayo sauce*
- gyoza sauce

*my faves, tasted great with my seafood! 

During my first visit I was able to try the ahi, shrimp, and salmon. Portions were decent, but a bit pricey; however, the quality of food justifies the price. Excellent customer service. Interior is a bit blah, but who really cares? We were the only ones dining in at the time. Other customers were just in and out. It seems like they get a lot of business with take out orders. 

Great tasting quality food minus the theatrics and awkwardness of sitting next to strangers.

Looking forward to returning and trying out the rib eye steak with garlic butter that so many rave about!"}
{"text":"Well, silly me. I received a few coupons in the mail from Teppen Bento last month & have stopped in for take-out 3 times now. I thought I had discovered a new & still unknown gem. I needed to write a review for this place--gosh, maybe I'd be the first reviewer!? Well, here I am, reviewer #232.

One of the reasons I thought this place was new is that it's usually empty when I stop in. But hey, I'm probably often their first customer of the day when I stop in at opening time on my way home from grocery shopping or something. At 11AM my taste goes toward sushi. At $4.95 for 8 pieces of California Roll or Vegetable Roll I've got a satisfying small lunch for myself. Only problem is, I know they have the best fried gyoza ($4.25 for 6 scrumptuous pieces) I've ever tasted so I often have to add that to my order. Yum!

This will be a great restaurant to take guests when we're looking for a simple, quick meal, or a nice meeting place for a group lunch."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by one of my brother's friends. First appearances, it doesn't look like much but the food is phenomenal. I got the tuna steak bento and my brother got the rib eye steak bento. We also got an eel nigiri on the side. Don't have pictures but it was delicious. The bento comes with your choice of rice and sautéed veggies. The tuna steak was seared perfectly. It was brown on the outside and a perfect pink on the inside. They also provided a lot of different sauces to go with the main entree. My brother's steak was cooked the way he wanted (medium rare) and the nigiri was also very delicious. The eel was crispy and just enough eel sauce to go with it. Service was also spot on. My water never reached empty and the waiter kept checking up on us. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"As most of the reviews have said great quality food for a good price.

My friend and I both got the salmon and steak. I got to say the portions here are spot on. The meal comes with rice (fried or white), lemon & garlic butter, cooked vegetables, steak and salmon! Overall each of the food was pretty spot on, I don't really have anything to complain about. I have to order some more of the garlic butter next time its so $$$.

It's apparent that they really care about the customers here. We were checked up on many times, and the guy even gave us a sampling of all the sauces he had! Pretty overwhelming at first but you should try it all.

Overall the place is super solid and I'll probably be coming around after work outs."}
{"text":"Basic crap miso, teriyaki ( ha, no seasoning or marination) chicken was obviously frozen and then over cooked, tempura anything tasted terrible like burnt oil. Plus sides, the sushi rolls are ok, gyoza as well, salad dressing was the best thing I got. Overall not good, worth half the price...or less"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi rolls!  Had the caterpillar roll, tiger roll and something off the menu.  The ingredients are very fresh.  The homemade spicy sauce has a real kick-never had anything like it before.  The owner is super friendly.  I would definitely come back to try the rest of the items on the menu.  Heard the steak and salmon is very popular."}
{"text":"I always seem to come back to Teppan Bento. The quality and taste of the food here is the same as sitting down and eating at a teppanyaki restaurant without all the hassle and prices. I love this place, all their sauces are fantastic.

Lim the owner is always so nice to me and provides excellent service. In fact everyone that works here treats me like family. Just thinking about this place and the food here makes me hungry right now lol."}
{"text":"fantastic!

great value and great quality. today was my first visit and i got the steak & shrimp combo. both items along with the veggies and rice were cooked to perfection! i will most definitely be visiting Teppan Bento on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I was craving Japanese food and didn't want to eat at the strip since it's overly priced. Then while yelping I came across this gem. It's a short drive away and definitely worth your buck. Here is what I have to say about it:

Such a friendly and delicious place!
The salmon poke is to die for, quality is GREAT.
I love how buttery the texture is for being so fresh. Definitely get this if you're a salmon sashimi lover + it has huge fresh avocado chunks and a delish home made ginger dressing on the side salad (This is my personal favorite).
Also the shrimp + garlic butter is also a killer! The shrimp is super tasty and prepared better than a couple other teppan restaurants I've been to (Benihana, Musashi). As a bonus, they provide juicy limes to squeeze all over it. 
Another popular item I got to try was the black angus rib-eye steak, mmmmm yummy & flavorful!
You can order it however you want- I preferred mine medium rare. It also comes with rice and grilled veggies (which are also delish).

Don't forget to claim the free goyza appetizer during check in ;)

The service was excellent and ate like a queen. 
Will return when I'm back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I heard about this place because of friend of mine knows Kevin, who works there. Let me just say that I was blown away by the expertise of how the food was cooked. Everything was very well seasoned, but not over-seasoned. The presentation is simple, but appealing. I had the teriyaki chicken and I was surprised by the flavor because I'm usually the beef kinda guy. I like the teriyaki chicken better than the steak! They were both good but that chicken is amazing!

The staff are really friendly, and you can tell they really enjoy what they are doing. Kevin introduced himself to us and is a really nice guy. He served us our food and made sure everything was enjoyable.

If you are looking for a great place to get an awesome lunch or dinner, don't write this place off because it's small. You don't want to miss this place!"}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service. I had the Shrimp and Salmon entree with brown rice and it was really delicious. The staff here is really attentive and want to make sure that you are satisfied and enjoying your experience at their restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a good restaurant could be better. Just improve customer service and get fresh food. Instead of frozen food change the cooking oil when its dark. The tempura looked like it was burnt and over cooked. I hope the food here gets better."}
{"text":"Tasty treat for those inclined for some benihana-esque flavors at a much more reasonable price!
The homemade ahi poke was a nice blend. 

The calamari and shrimp bento box was nicely cooked, not overdone and rubbery.  The grilled vegetables were slightly over seasoned for my tastes but I tend to like mine under seasoned. 

The chicken fried rice and the garlic butter that they serve in addition to the variety of sauces is awesome!"}
{"text":"Still one of my favorite places to go.  The staff is so friendly and welcoming.  The food is excellent.  I love all the flavor and love they put in every time they cook the meals which is always fresh to order.  They have a bunch of different sauces to choose from.  I'm a creature of habit and love their steak bento but have tried all of them and they are delicious.  I would recommend anyone to come here,  especially if they are in the mood for some hot fresh,  Japanese style food that is amazing."}
{"text":"Ordered the salmon and shrimp with fried rice and the salmon was cooked medium.  To perfection.    All the fish here is sushi grade.   It was served with chicken fried rice and garlic butter and a bunch of different sauces.   Everything was very good.  The chef is very nice and talked with us a bit.  The inside of the restaurant isn't very appealing. But the food is delicious.  definitely be back."}
{"text":"Visiting Las Vegas from Los Angeles with the 2 kids and wifey.  We stumbled upon this place after shopping at the Premium Outlets.  I noticed 1 Japanese Restaurant with 50 reviews (5 stars) so we had to check it out.  I ordered the NY Steak with Salmon and was completely satisfied.  Our server Kevin made us feel welcomed.  I haven't received this type of customer service in a long time.  We will for sure be dropping by here in our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Now that I have dined in and ordered take-out, I have nothing but good things to say. If you are looking for a filling, but reasonable priced meal, Teppan Bento is the place to be. This is conveniently located on Silverado and Bermuda with the Filipino market and Kung Fu Tea. There's always plenty of parking space and seating if you choose to dine in. It's a very casual restaurant so there's no need to whip out your fancy dress or shoes! The service is always on point. The woman was very thorough about their menu the first time we went and when we dined in, the server offered recommendation such as adding curry with the chicken katsu and a sauce that would compliment the steak well. Everything is reasonably priced with a large portion. The lunch special is the best! It comes with your choice of meat, vegetables, and your choice of rice (brown/white). For a small additional fee, you have the option of chicken fried rice or curry! Everything is so delicious and this is definitely a better alternative to fast food!"}
{"text":"Found this place for a quick and healthy dinner option. We had the steak/shrimp bento and chicken/calamari bento and they were both amazing and very well priced. Check it out!"}
{"text":"... My family and I love this place!! The service is fast and friendly ... The food is soooooooo delicious and the prices are great!!!  We're always in a rush so we call ahead and get our bentos to go.... But they now have lots of booth seating.  Our favorites are the  Grilled Steak... Shrimp...salmon... Calamari.... Chicken....it is prepared Teppanyaki style with the most delicious sauces - the garlic butter, ginger and mustard sauce are my favorites!  A must try!!  Lots of convenient parking... In the shopping center where fresh and easy was On Silverado and Bermuda. See you there!!"}
{"text":"While looking for a place to grub for dinner, a group of friends and I were attracted to this place by the 5 star rating. As we walked in we noticed it's a pretty small sized space with the cashier right in front as you walk in and 4 dine in tables. Their area of strength that was instantly noticeable was their excellent service. For example, one of my friends, the asshole he is, brought a soup from a neighboring restaurant. The kind woman at the cashier offered him a spoon to eat, as well as a cup of water. If that's not good service I don't know what is! Onto the food...

The menu is fairly small with a few starter dishes and their main bento boxes have meat choices of chicken, shrimp, and beef. 

We ordered the chicken/shrimp box and the ribeye box with sides of seaweed salad and fried shrimp. The highlight was definitely the ribeye and the garlic butter that came on the side with it. Meat was requested as medium-rare and it came out as such. Very tender and full of flavor. The above mentioned garlic butter is a delicious compliment to the ribeye (or to any of the meats for that matter), and it's not a surprise why it's featured in so many of these reviews. The seaweed salad was also excellent, might be an acquired taste since some people don't enjoy it. 
 
Pricing is extremely fair for the serving size and quality. For 2 bento boxes and 3 sides we paid a total of 50$. 

The place has a nice homey, hole in the wall feel to it and the complimentary water cooler with cups is a nice touch if you don't drink soda. 

Great place, great food, will def be visiting again."}
{"text":"Teppan Bento was a hidden gem! I ordered the lunch size steak plate with chicken fried rice. It's the perfect amount for me and the flavors are incredible. I'm really picky about my steak because I like it cooked medium rare-rare and at most places it comes out too over cooked. The chef/owner knew exactly what I meant when I asked for rare plus. The meat was tender and melts in your mouth. The garlic butter sauce was amazing. I suggest trying the chicken fried rice as well. The price was really reasonable, less than $10. The place is really hole in the wall, not super decorated but the food was well worth it. Will definitely be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Great new eatery! I am not only rating the excellent meal I had with my family but I am giving this place 5 stars for their exceptional customer service. Everyone was so incredibly attentive and informative. The owners brought out all different kinds of dipping sauces (HUGE fan of the sweet and spicy sauce) and gave us dishes on the house. Although we did also order a massive amount of food so we could have a taste of everything.
My family and I ordered: steak bento, steak and shrimp bento, 2 chicken katsu bento, shrimp bento, and shrimp tempura. We also got a free appetizer for ordering 5 bento boxes. It's usually a free chicken katsu but they allowed us to substitute it for the calamari, which was delicious and juicy. Everything was cooked fresh since it's teppanyaki and everything tasted great! I'd definitely recommend the calamari appetizer and steak bento for sure! And most definitely ask for the assortment of spicy dipping sauces. We're a condiments family so we were in heaven! And beverages come with the meal. They don't do fountain drinks, they offer cans and bottled water. The service was so wonderful that we couldn't help but to leave extra tip. Will definitely be back again. Hope this place never changes!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken + shrimp bento with fried rice, and it was delicious! Excellent service and nice little place! I would definitely come back and try the other items on the menu. This is a good place if you're looking for something quick."}
{"text":"Our first and definitely not our last visit was today.  Food was cooked fresh and still a good temperature for out takeout order.  I really enjoy the bento box concept.  Looking forward to our next order!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise this place is. Tucked in a strip mall where a mediocre cheesesteak shop used to be, this place serves legit bento boxes of teppanyaki. We ordered marinated chicken and ribeye bento boxes, as well as an order of chicken katsu.

The katsu was great, crisp with panko and served with flavorful sauces. The marinated chicken was good, especially with the complex ginger sauce that accompanied it. But the star performer here was the ribeye, served with spicy mayo and mustard sauces.

We upgraded from white rice to chicken fried rice, which was also delicious. The vegetables that accompanied them were obviously fresh.

The service was friendly and prompt. We were raving about this place the rest of the weekend after eating it. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"MUST TRY PLACE!!!!!!
This is my new favorite place!
The portion size is ALOT & the food is so fn tasty! 
It was my first time here & Kevin provided great service (welcoming, knowledgeable, quick and thoughtful)- I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time. I have brought friends, family, and refer others to try their shrimp bento with garlic butter. It is a family owned business and the owner is such a nice gentleman. He talks with every customer and is very personable. The shrimp is cooked to perfection as well as the Angus steak and salmon bentos. I found this place via Yelp and I highly suggest trying this place."}
{"text":"My son and I ate here for the first time tonight and we can't believe we have taken so long to stop in. The service was wonderful, the food amazing and reasonable prices. Will recommend Teppan Bento to everyone.  Thank you Kevin for the great experience."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and tastes good. They have very good customer service. It is a good option if you are in hurry."}
{"text":"This is the spot!  Like Benihana or Musashi without the show, or the price. Teppanyaki in a box. So far we've tried the steak, shrimp, salmon and calamari. Everything's been great! Very affordable and down the street from our house. They've been friendly on both visits. Keep in mind they're closed on Monday, we came for dinner yesterday and they were closed.. Sucked for us but we ended up coming back today (Tuesday)."}
{"text":"First off, very friendly staff. The food is great for the price. Good amount of veggies and rice to go with your bento boxes. Various types of meat are available. Pretty simple menu. I had the steak bento. Steak was cooked perfectly. They have various sauces to dip your meats into. The fried noodles were great, we went with the cook's suggestion on steak and carrots. Perfectly cooked noodles with a sweet sauce."}
{"text":"Just ate there with my mom. Fantastic food and service. This is definitely a $ not $$. The prices are good for the food. Try the salmon. OMG!! Use the steak or salmon with the ginger sauce or spicy mayo. Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and excellent service. We were very happy we discovered this place. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"What a delightful little place!   We were greeted at the door by the owner and the son.  This place is clean and tidy.   There is a Yelp deal for a free appetizer and they told us about it.  

When the app arrived, they added a second app because the owner wanted to try something new. They asked us for feedback about the app and were very sweet about it.  

We both ordered a bento box and both were tasty, fresh and hot.  They asked several times if we were enjoying the food and it was endearing and not annoying.  

If you like spicy foods, they have this dipping sauce that is delivered with the gyoza and the bento box.  It is spicy and just amazing!   This place is fantastic and it is my new favorite spot for teppan style food.    Five stars!"}
{"text":"I came in late at night and didn't realized they closed so early. They were still pretty attentive and more than happy to take the order. 

Ordered salmon and steak for me and chicken and shrimp for my friend. I wanted fried rice but apparently they ran out. Also ordered the dumplings. 

Dumplings tasted like frozen food. THe bento boxes were great and all the dishes were cooked well. They ended up giving me some fried rice but it was super old and inedible. Either way I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt and will be trying them again soon. Will update once that happens."}
{"text":"This place rocks.

Quality, fresh teppanyaki dishes prepared super quick and offered at a reasonable price. I have had the steak, chicken, salmon, shrimp and poke; they were all delicious and cooked to perfection. Great service as well. Definitely worth checking out, glad I did."}
{"text":"The prices are very good for the quality food they provide. I appreciate the healthy choices for my athletic powered lifestyle."}
{"text":"This place is legit!  I had the steak lunch special and it was soooo good.  The steak was very tender and flavorful as well as the sauces they had for dipping. This was my first time here highly influenced by a friend's recommendation. I was NOT disappointed. They were very friendly and attentive to any of our needs.  I felt they were willing to go above and beyond to make my experience the best.  I left thinking about the next time I'd visit.  I will definitely be returning and bringing my husband and family as well as any friends that will come with."}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and been wanting to try this place out and finally got the chance today. I love me some teppanyaki, and this quick to go version is awesome. I got the steak and chicken bento box, it comes with your choice of white or brown rice (fried rice is $1.90 extra, which seems a little steep to me, some grilled vegetables mostly carrots and zucchini with some onions, and a garlic butter to dip your meats in. A quick decently priced healthy take out meal. The staff was very friendly. The inside looks a little old and ran down which is strange for the location but didn't bother me. Good food though, check it out!"}
{"text":"Went on Sunday 5-29-16 around 6pm.  $41.12 got us two bento boxes, two drinks, a shrimp tempura appetizer, and a tuna sashimi plate. Service was very prompt and friendly.  There is a yelp check-in offer right now of 10% off and I had no trouble redeeming it. 

I got the steak and salmon bento for $12.50 and upgraded the rice to fried rice for like $2 more.  The steak was cooked perfectly to medium and the salmon was delicious.  Even the veggies had a great flavor to them.  Next time I would pass on the fried rice though because it was not tasty.  It looked like it was just colored brown with miniscule chunks of chicken in it.  I prefer my fried rice with some veggies in it and I like it to have that nice charred flavor from the wok.  

This would be a great place to eat if you were watching your girlish figure because the food is lean and healthy but incredibly flavorful.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My husband finished his calamari and shrimp bento box very promptly. I very begrudgingly had to give up eating my double beef steak bento - but I tried so very hard to keep going. Almost gorging myself to a food belly. Okay fine... I did good food belly and it was worth it. 

This place is well worth the drive from wherever you live or wherever you're staying! So delicious!!"}
{"text":"Came by here today to grab lunch, I have a Cricket store right across the street and never saw this place until I yelped since I dont live in the area.

Honestly the price was fair and service was better than most in and out restaurants like this. Owners were working which is always a plus in my book. $30 for steak and shrimp with fried rice and steak and salmon with white rice.

Steak was slightly overcooked which is understandable since its such small cubes of beef, but flavor was good. Could use a bit more seasoning on the steak itself, but with the sauces provided it was still pretty damn good.

The highlight by FAR was the salmon which was cooked perfectly medium like I requested and the shrimp was cooked perfectly as well. The garlic butter they serve with it is laced with crack cocaine for certain.

I will definitely be back to eat here when I am stopping by my store."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! So refreshing so delicious so amazinggggggg. Not just the food but the owner and start are so delightful. You'll definitely have to experience this place for yourself though. Also it's healthy so I will for sure be coming back. Steak, shrimp, salmon, chicken, the yakisoba!!! It's all amazing. 5 out of 5 stars without a doubt. Okay bye"}
{"text":"My first time going and I was impressed. The food was good and all the sauces were great as well. If you checked in on Yelp they gave you a free order of gyoza's which was also very appetizing. The staff was very attentive and nice. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great staff, very attentive. Every time I come in, I'm always greeted with a smile. I ordered the seafood bento box. Delicious! Everything is seasoned just right. Best shrimp I've had in awhile with a grilled salmon, veggies, and rice. Also with buttered garlic dipping sauce, ginger sauce, and yummy yummy sauce. Very reasonably price And they also offer catering! 

I would definitely recommend this place for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"I ordered the curry and rice, normally the curry is served with the katsu. I was about half way through feeling very satisfied with my order then I found a big chunk of the curry cube. It ruined and otherwise decent experience."}
{"text":"Food is good. But definitely NOT Japanese flavor; more like Filipino flavoring.  This is disappointing for me. Others may not mind or even care.  Service is very good and friendly."}
{"text":"Good food & quick service @ a reasonable price!! The steak was cooked to perfection!  My husbands salmon was beautifully cooked!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! 
I enjoyed my food. Just thought it was a little overpriced for the amount we got. Also, their Shrimp Gyoza barely had any shrimp at all, it was filled with more tofu-like stuff instead. Those are my only complaints. Besides that, it is quick food and friendly service!"}
{"text":"I think my expectations were higher for this place due to the reviews. My gf and I decided to dine in...luckily we got there just in time because there are only 5 tables here. They messed up my gfs order because she ordered the fried rice but when she got her plate it was steamed rice ..we weren't going to say anything but since I was afraid she was gonna get charged for something she never received..we let our waiter know. Our waiter seemed a bit distracted ...he told us it was the cooks fault or something like that .. I just know he blamed someone back there lol... I had the steak and calamari. The steak was cooked medium well and was pretty good the calamari was tender but could have been cooked just a tad longer for me. My gf had the chicken and salmon. The salmon was not too bad and the chicken wasn't over cooked. We also ordered the mixed tempura which was a bit smaller than I expected it would be. I did enjoy the yummy sauce that loves up to its name. The yummy sauce is a citrus and creamy at the same time with some tang kick to it ...went well with the salmon. The teriyaki sauce I tend to like a thicker sauce this one was just way too thin for me. I would give this place another try ... I just hope the service is a little better the way other people described and next time I shall try the other options. My experience was subpar but I'm willing to give them another try.. Everyone deserves a second chance ...maybe our waiter was new and was still learning the ropes who knows!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Great and friendly service. We had the chicken and beef combination bento. Both the chicken and beef were cooked perfectly...so tender and juicy! The house-made mustard sauce pairs great with the beef!
We will definitely be back the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"So I was upset at first once I was delivered my food at the nail salon because I had ordered and paid for $3.50 extra for fried rice. After my nails were done I walked back over and let them know. Their reaction definitely changed my outlook because they fixed the order immediately and offered me a meal on the house and were super apologetic and kind. Also, THE FOOD WAS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. Very fresh and healthy, but good tasting. Great staff, great food, great place! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and checked it out with my family. 
It's a small place with a few seats.
We tried Steak, Chicken and Calamari bentos.
They were all good. Meat was very tender. The sauces that it came with were all flavorful.
The Bento boxes came with vegetable and rice which is good.  
Staff was friendly and the price is fair."}
