{"text":"Three for friendly and extremely quick service. Our waitress had worked there for 18 years and was worth visiting just to see her hairdo. Ma and pop restaurant full of locals cons: The orange juice is Sunny Delight (we stuck with water), pros: the breakfast sandwiches are pretty good. Not a bad stop if your on the road!
My kids wanted me to say that \"There's a really nice lady who gives tons of lollypops.We ended up leaving with about 15(not bad!) Hope you like it!!!\""}
{"text":"I used to love this place. Yesterday I went for breakfast and ordered a western omelet. It had no cheese and skimpy on the rest.  I went back that evening for a perch dinner. The slaw was rancid the fish was way over cooked and the tartar sauce tasted like I don't what. However, the service was very good as usual."}
{"text":"We come here everytime we're in Ohio. Good food, good chef and service. Good coffee and large portions for your money, a win, win!"}
{"text":"This is a good spot for breakfast and the wait staff is very friendly. I've had good lunches, too. Dinner isn't bad, but it's the breakfast that draws me here every time!"}
{"text":"3+ stars for breakfast! Perfect short-order diner for a quick quality breakfast! Quick service... omelettes and eggs are great! Reasonable prices. We will come back again!

The decor is outdated and the bathrooms BADLY need rennovating!!!"}
{"text":"George's restaurant has great \"homestyle\" cooking. Now, THAT'S a cheeseburger! Comfortable ambiance and excellent attention from our waitress, Lisa. Old fashioned customer service.... That's George's! Although I did enjoy corned beef wrap at George's, I preferred Blue Sky's, the wrap had a slight toast, and a distinct, tasty cheese."}
{"text":"I loved eating at George's.  Generous portions,friendly waitresses . Food was very good. I would definitely eat there again. We ate there for lunch, my husband ordered breakfast."}
{"text":"Love this place. A wonderful spot for good food with good friends. You'll always see families and old friends shooting the breeze here. Affordable and delicious. I've never been disappointed with the quality of the food or the service. Try the omelettes or the country fried steak"}
{"text":"We eat here on lazy Sunday mornings. The service is great and it just feels like home. They don't mind our crazy kids or the mess we leave behind. The food is cheap and omg the portions are huge. If you get the special which is usually something like fried pork chops, homemade beef tips with noodles, or chicken paprikas, it comes with soup a salad and a side all for around $7 bucks a plate. It's not fine dining by any means but it's some really good down home cooking!"}
{"text":"Ok.... My husband decided to take me somewhere new, and this is where we ended up! The place was packed, and it's seat yourself. I honestly thought it was going to be a super long wait. Within one minute of sitting we had coffee and waters in front of us. Our server Jessica was extremely nice and took great care of us and our small rowdy children! The food came out within 10 minutes of ordering. The price here is great, and worth the drive. Six bucks got toast eggs hashbrowns and sausage. I think I found my new favorite breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna give this place 5 stars mannn the food quality is great ! I had the Spanish omelette with jalape√±o peppers and onion green peppers, and tomato excellent and the portions nice. The inside is kind of dated but they make up for it in food . I think the menu is way too large for a restaurant this size it's like 4 pages long. But the big but everything we ordered was great according to my guests I was with. A must stop if your in the Lorain Elyria area!"}
{"text":"Gosh, I love this place. I love, love, love, love, love it.

I order the same thing every time and with one exception (ordering breakfast at lunch time isn't the smartest thing) it has been amazing. I'm very particular about my eggs and yet they come out perfectly over-medium with a runny yolk and fully cooked whites. The hash browns are so yummy--so yummy! And the toast, coffee and water is good too.

The thing I love the most? It's not salty! Lots of breakfast places use too much salt and this place uses the perfect amount. 

I love this place. It's the only resaurant I'll really miss when I move out of Lorain!"}
