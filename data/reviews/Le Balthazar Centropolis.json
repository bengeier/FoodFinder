{"text":"Bel endroit. Chaleureux. Plein de sortes de bières. Spectacles. Age moyen lors de notres visite entre 22H00 et 3H00, 18 et 35 ans environ. Nous etions plus vieux et c'était très bien quand même."}
{"text":"Best bar in Laval, period. Unbelievable selection of beer. Prices are good and ambiance is ok. Only problem is food selection suck. Expensive food."}
{"text":"We tried out the Balthazar at the Dix30 in Brossard. We were very disappointed by our visit. First of all, we waited at the door for several minutes before a hostess came. Secondly, all the items on the menu are expensive, we were expecting some great food. The utensils are cheap (when you pay 30$ for your meal, you want to eat with proper utensils). We waited about half an hour for our order (although we ordered a salad and tartare) and there was a mix up with the order (salmon tartare instead of the tuna). The tartare is severed with fries OR salad and with regular bread, something more or at least both fries and salad would be normal and appreciated. We were offered some mayonnaise and we were surprised to see that it was not even close to home made (Heinz mayo) When you pay 30$ for your meal (45$ with tax and service), you expect a higher quality! The staff was new (the place has been opened for 2 weeks) and unexperienced but friendly and respectful. The restaurant is huge and very busy and the seating was not comfortable. We will not be going again and sadly do not recommend this restaurant it would be a waste of your money."}
{"text":"Good for all those people who want show off!! Food too expensive and okey selection of beer and drinks.. Service ok..
Will think twice next time..."}
{"text":"The service is really bad . The menu sucks ! Yes the beer is good cause they chose microbreweries like charlevoix that have the same recipes like European beer . I have been to alot of microbreweries in Quebec that have there own beer recipes. You can't even have a real coffee they make coffee with nespresso!"}
{"text":"Le classique du Centropolis. Tout d'abord, on y va pour le choix de bières. Plus d'une quarantaine à découvrir! J'aime particulièrement la blanche Balthazar :) 
On y reste pour le super menu et la bouffe de qualité. Si vous êtes indécis, demandez conseil aux serveurs les plus sympas du Centro! Je vous suggère les nachos, n'importe quelle poutine, les tartares (surtout le saumon et le boeuf) et la bavette. L'ajout tout récemment des poké bowls est un choix judicieux du chef puisqu'ils sont vraiment délicieux. 
Finalement, on termine la soirée là-bas pour les bands live qui sont la plupart du temps vraiment talentueux et aussi pour prendre un dernier verre (ou quelques shooters) et jaser avec les barmaids les plus gentilles et drôles des restos de Laval!"}
{"text":"Bon choix de bières de microbrasseries québécoises et nourritures bien pour ce type d'endroit. Service extrêmement lent et pas toujours le meilleur. Attendu 5 grosses minutes avant de me faire servir. Oui la place était pleine mais même pas de \"bonjour, je vais être avec vous dans pas long\". Je commençais à me demander si j'étais invisible."}
{"text":"Je donne 4 étoiles pour l'emplacement, la connaissance et le service du staff, le live band et la variété du menu. Ce n'est pas un endroit où j'irai pour manger, mais plutot pour un verre et des nachos à partager en couple ou entre gang d'amis. D'ailleurs en parlant de leur nachos, rien à redire, super. J'ai aimé mes 2 visites!"}
{"text":"Demandez les ailes de poulet en à 0,50$ les jeudis pendant le 5 à 7....

J'enlève une étoile, car l'ambiance...ennuyante, même avec un petit band qui joue. De plus, il y a juste 3-4 bières qui sont en spécial durant le 4@7... Bref, un peu déçu..."}
{"text":"The craft beer prices are good.
The menu is a bit pricey but the quality matches it. 

The beer selection is great. The fact you can take a tasting selection for 8$ is a great thing. Specially before committing to a full pint.

I would have never picked a full pint of the casket room temp beer. But after a try I was on board. Same for my boyfriend who wasn't sure about a fruit infused beer that ended up being a hit for both of us.

With the beer I had the potato donuts. It was amazingly good. Straight from the fryer and served with a maple glaze on the side, it was good.

The menu looked really good, but was a bit too pricey for me. (25$ for a salad?) but if you stick to the beer and maybe some appetizer/dessert I'm sure you can have a good time."}
{"text":"Nice place to kick back and enjoy a local beer. The food is just okay, not exactly hot.  But the help is awesome... Definitely go when Annie is working!"}
{"text":"Awwww.... beer!

Well, I'm not a beer drinker, but hubby is. So, we went to Balthazar over the weekend for a second visit. 

I can't say I was enchanted with my \"pulled pork poutine\". Not that it was not good. Everything was good: pulled pork, fresh french fries, cheese... the weird part was the gravy... it was an home made bbq gravy. Which in itself was very very good... but the mix didn't do it for me, at all.

Why then, do i give it a 4 star??? Well, we sat at the bar (our favorite places anywhere I think), and the waiter/barman and all the staff we got to talk with were something special. Very nice, sociable, knowledgeable of their products. That, and my husband's experience seemed to have been more than great. His food, the 3 beers he tried and our desert! 

Loved the ambiance and staff, but was so-so with the food. Hubby would have given it a 5 stars! he loved it all!"}
{"text":"This place is great for beer losers in Laval. It has a huge selection is beers. While that's great and their knowledge on the beers, that's really all they have to offer."}
{"text":"Before I start my review, be warned, this place gets extremely busy from Thursday to Saturday.

If you did not reserve, don't expect to get seated especially Friday and Saturday. That being said, it is not an offense to the restaurant or their patrons, it's just reality and I want you guys to have read this disclaimer.

Now on to the review, I have been here multiple times for different type of events:
- Date night (me and girlfriend)
- 5 à 7
- Hockey games
- Boys night out
- Karaoke Nights (Used to be Mondays, now it's on Sundays)

And I have to say that the food, beer, and cocktails have always been a solid 4.5 stars. Only con is that it gets overcrowded, and very busy, so sometimes, service will be delayed - but that being said, it is normal, you can't expect your food to arrive in 5 minutes when it is full house.

Great staff that works beyond your expectations to make sure you're happy, plus, they are friendly. 

Visit this place! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"If I wanted to hang out in St Jerome... I would go to St Jerome. 

The dbag levels were off the charts, even by Laval standards. I found nothing endearing about this place to report on. Large Quebec beer selection, but pathetic hard liquor selection. If you're not into mediocre beer then you're going to be disappointed with what's on the shelf. 

Live music... I guess that's what it was. I'd rather pierce my own nipples then go through that again. And some obnoxious guy with bad tattoos would pretend it was his own personal karaoke machine and sing along on stage, into the musicians mic. I think he was the owner or manager. 

Service was ok. I don't like chasing the waiter for 20 minutes just to pay. 

This is your place if you remember Fuzzy as a great place. And if you're from Brossard, and are looking for a place to hang out in, look no further."}
{"text":"This review is a combination of a few visits while traveling in Laval for work over a few weeks.  I found this place not only had good food and beer but the atmosphere was also quite awesome.  They had great music and when solo sitting at the bar was ideal for catching the game!"}
{"text":"The marriage between the food & the beer is excellent! Service is great & the staff knows their beers & they're a good reference if you don't know what to pick! The ambiance is friendly! Food was good but I found the beef tartar salty"}
{"text":"Voici un autre de ces restos qui se mérite la note \"Bof\" (3 étoiles). Voyons voir pourquoi... 

En général, la cuisine ici est très correcte. L'endroit propose un menu du genre cuisine québécoise remodelée au goût du jour et \" snobisée \". On trouve donc à la carte des poutines gastronomiques avec du magret de canard ou avec du cheddar vieillit et sauce à la bière noire. On offre aussi une large variété de burgers et de grillades. Aussi, des entrés surprenantes, tel que de la pieuvre apprêtée à la manière Général Tao ou du ris de veau popcorn. Original et efficace. Vous voyez le genre ? De ce côté, rien à redire. 

Ce qui tue chez Le Balthazar c'est le service. Il est terriblement long. Désespérément long même. Nous sommes entrés ici à 19 h. Après avoir poiroté une heure devant nos bières, le serveur a finalement daigné (sous notre insistance) prendre notre commande, et ce, vers les 20 h. À ce moment, il a même eu l'affront de nous dire : \" je dois d'abord vérifier avec le chef s'il est prêt à prendre votre commande \". Pardon ? Fallait le dire plus tôt non ? Les premières assiettes sont arrivées à notre table vers 20h45. Donc 1 h 45 minutes après avoir été assis par le placier. C'est vraiment trop long. 

Malgré le service exécrable, je dirais que la force du Balthazar réside dans son très grand menu de bières québécoises. Je souligne aussi que le menu bouffe propose des accords mets - bières pour chacun de ses plats. Bravo, j'adore l'initiative. 

Pour conclure, malgré quelques belles trouvailles gastronomiques, je ne crois pas revenir ici à cause du service. Dommage."}
{"text":"I came her on a busy night and being in the restaurant industry sometimes I'm a bit too understanding ... but this time I was hungry and waited over 45 min to order. When the waitress finally came she took our orders for drinks and quickly left, I got a bit ticked off because I was more than ready to order food and when she left I mentioned loudly due to the pub noise that I wasnt finished ordering however the moment was gone. 15 minutes later she comes with our beers , her knowledge on it was very good considering I had taken an assortment of 4x4oz tasters and my partner a simple house brew pint. We finally ended up ordering nachos and chicken wings that were a good pair and then I took the goat salad that had 3 scoops of goat cheese a bit much but the dressing in the salad mix was nice. My partner on the other hand ordered the bavette de boeuf \"rare\" and got his well done. At that time we were too hungry to fuss over and have them redo it so we settled with it. All in all , this place is better for groups then a simple couple night outand obviously my take if ever I come back would be just for the beer and finger food."}
{"text":"Superbe ambiance et beaucoup de choix dès micro québécoises! Nous avons été très bien conseiller, les prix de bouffe sont un peut cher pour un endroit de ce type, mais l'expérience et le service vaut la peine!"}
{"text":"The terrasse was very nice on a warm summer day. The beers were ok and the food was good. The chicken wings I asked were very delicious, the only thing were the fries which were quite burned. The service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Beer - 100% Québécois! Our dearest province is home to many exceptional crafted beers. Le Balthazar proposes a concise but well thought beer menu that includes beer only made in the Québec province. 

Beer sommelier - Love it! From 5 to 11 (I think) a beer sommelier is on the premises to suggest and comment great choices of barley juices (aka Beer). 

Food - Fantastic! The food is great. To this day, I've tried the steak bavette as well as the fish N'chips. The steak is tasty and the fish N'chip has the must, seriously the crispiest crust ever. 

Service - Lacking a bit! I found that the service was a bit lazy. Several times did we have to wave our hands to the server while she was snacking and chatting with other servers. An empty beer that has been standing on the table is not supposed to stay there for 10min, especially when there are not so many customers around. We had to wave once to order our beer, twice to order something to snack, trice for the second beer, again to order food, and yet again to get the check. The first time wasn't great either. 

Ambiance - elevated ceilling creates room, and the length-less wooden bar is incredible. The overall ambiance is great...when they are not trying to replicate U2's concert indoor! Damn, music is so loud late in the evening. Also, the ventilating fan makes a buzzy sound that drives you nuts. According to the server, an issue they've been dealing with since they opened...Then fix it!?!?

Overall, great beer, great food, but lacks (to my opinion) on service."}
{"text":"Recently opened in Laval's Centropolis, Le Balthazar Laval is the sister of the original one at Joliette.  Serving beers exclusively from Quebec breweries, it is an excellent place to have a tasting of different type of beers or to sip at a local recipe! You can select a tasting of 4 or 5 small portions of beer with very affordable prices.  My personal favorite is La Vie de Château from Le Grimoire which has a slight rum and caramel taste or the selection from the brewery of Ile d'Orleans! They also offer an interesting menu of pub foods that is surprisingly good.  However, the service is slow and not that knowledgeable of their products.  And they have this fan that just makes this constant and annoying noise... not cool... But I must point, if you are lucky, you might catch the 'sommelier' which has great knowledge and passion about beers! A good place to have a beer between friends without the problem of finding a parking ;) Hey it is Laval after all :D"}
