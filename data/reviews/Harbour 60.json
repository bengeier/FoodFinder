{"text":"The service was really good, it did feel like we were in a very high end restaurant, my friend and I of course ordered a steak each, but to be honest I've had better steak and when you are paying almost 100$ per steak I was expecting much more from it. I don't think this is steakhouse I will returning to on my own free will ."}
{"text":"I've heard good and bad things about this Harbour Sixty but the times I have gone I would say that  it is above average.  The thing with this restaurant is that the prices are ridiculously high given that they cater to Bay streeters.  I say this based on the clientele that seem to always frequent this restaurant.  I'll be honest the clientele kind of kills the environment for me as it reminds me of the many work lunches that I have gone to.  

Steak is wonderful.  They cook it to what you ask for but I am not particularly fond of the service.  I'd explain it by saying that the service seems forced and artificial to me.  I've spoken to people that have worked in the kitchens in a variety of fine dining steakhouses and they all tell me that the standards are not up to par with some of the other places that they have worked at.  I'm not sure what that means but I thought I'd include it in the review.  

Nice place, I'd go back but not my favorite."}
{"text":"The food and service here are fantastic! 

I highly recommend the octopus dinner appetizer. I'm not usually a fan of octopus, but the way they cook it here the texture is not rubbery whatsoever. The portion is big enough for a 1 person entre and comes with different veggies. 

The crab mashed potatoes are great as well. 

Overall a very good place to eat before catching a hockey game at the ACC."}
{"text":"Summary: A credible-but-not-great steak joint rendered awful by the clientele.

Every review here seems to have a few raves: the decor, the hostesses, and the food. 

The decor is thoroughly neutral and OK, but it is neither a memorable nor a particularly comfortable space.

The hostesses, described as \"model-like\" in other reviews, may have made models of cars, buildings, or atomic structures, but they were not models themselves as judged by appearance. Perhaps they were \"model hostesses\" in that they set a standard for hostessing as an activity?

The food was good, basically. There was an intriguing array of items brought with the bread, including a cheese-and-garlic spread rendered in a sort of tapenade texture that was very nice.

I had a lobster chowder that was well seasoned and had big chunks of lobster as an appetizer. My companion had a bland crab cake that tasted like it included a diverse and innovative combination of seasonings such as salt and perhaps a little more salt.

We ordered steaks for the entree, and they were perfectly cooked to order. Of course, my companion got the one I ordered, and I got the one she ordered. So, conceptually, it was like sending your gay male friend a female stripper. In all seriousness, at this price point who gets what steak should not be something the customer should have to sort through.

Dessert was baked Alaska, which was excellent.

Now, for our companions for the meal. We were seated at a table for two which was in a line of about 5 such tables approximately 20 inches apart. So, we got to know the people at the adjacent tables. I will highlight the table to my right. The young lady at the table appeared to be wearing a push-up bustier that didn't fit, allowing that which was to be pushed up to fall down. The solution? Manually lift the items up to display level. When they dropped again, repeat. My meal was basically ruined by this obnoxious breast preening.
 
The gentleman to my right took the liberty of slapping me on my arm to ask what soup I had just finished. \"Dude, that looks good.\"

The room basically seemed to be full of people who were ill-dressed and ill-mannered who were there for a special occasion. These occasions seemed to range from birthdays and anniversaries to acquittals and dodged-a-bullet STD test results. I didn't see a tie in the room, but I saw a lot of jeans, glitter and turquoise. These people were loud, obnoxious, and seemed to think the waiter calling them \"buddy\" or \"friend\" was appropriate; to me, it was strange and really brought down the tone. When you read every other review, please note that it is this clueless clientele that is so satisfied. Many reviews mention the free valet parking. Perhaps you're driving in from St. Catharines and valet parking and a location at a Gardiner off-ramp is crucial to you after a two hour drive, no matter what the rest of the experience involves? But, for everyone else, I can't see why this would be important.

For the same overall experience, I'd go to another special-occassion-for-the-ill-bred joint, maybe Red Lobster, and pocket the couple of hundred of savings."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointing experience. Let me preface this by saying the only reason I'm awarding Two Stars is for our server Elkin & the kitchen staff. My biggest complaint is with the Manager, Krystin I think her name is.

Let's go back to last summer. Around August of 2013 I planned on going before a concert with a potential client and colleague who had not been to Harbour60. It was going to be great as Harbour is opposite of the Air Canada Centre. I phoned ~3weeks ahead to make sure it was accessible to get into. Yes, of course it was they assured me. The wheelchair lifts are at the back. Perfect. Phone ~1week ahead, yes, everything is great and finally the day of, everything is still good.

So we get there, go down the first wheelchair lift no problem then I'm ushered into the back of the restaurant. The first sight is of recycling bins, garbage cans, tables & chairs and that recycling smell. Not exactly how I want to be greeted but whatever, I'm not a complainer. Then for the second wheelchair lift. Ahh, it's folded to the side.

There is a black piece of wood acting as a ramp down the stairs. I'm told that the lift hasn't been used in a long time and that \"everyone\" just uses the ramp. I don't expect anything to be near building code for accessibility but this was far steeper than what I felt comfortable with & definitely not what one would expect from a \"top restaurant.\"

Needless to say I look like a bit of an idiot in front of my clients & guests, I picked a restaurant I can't get into, bummer. No one offers any idea or help. So we went somewhere else. The next day I phone back and talk to the Manager (at the time), Virginia. I let her know what happened and how I felt lied to as the wheelchair lift clearly had not been working and the attitude from the valet. I was over it but frankly thought I should let her know so that no one else has a similar experience. She pleasantly offers me a gift card and that next time she will do something \"really nice for [you].\"

So in August 2014 I made a reservation for myself, a friend & his date. I go through the same process of making sure that the lifts are working. Saturday night @ 8.30pm I get there and it's the exact same problem. Now I look stupid and so does my friend in front of his date. Luckily my friend is a bigger guy and I felt comfortable with him holding the back of my chair.

I call back two days later and talk to the manager, Krystin. From the tone of her voice it sounds like she could not care less and I basically felt like a second class citizen. She said she would call me back the next day, nope. 

Now I'm not a complainer but when spending close to $500 on a dinner I would like things to go smoothly. I i basically felt like I was a nuisance to them and confirmed by the treatment I got from Krystin over the phone. I know there are not that many wheelchair customers who might be affected by this or read this, but it is the ethical  experience behind it that leaves a \"bad taste in my mouth.\" Since then I have had multiple people without disabilities tell me they will no longer go as they have friends or family that have been in chairs and understand what it is like. 

It sucks to feel like an afterthought, nuisance or a problem but even worse to look like an idiot in front of other people. 

Hence the 1-Star."}
{"text":"Amazing experience here.  Top notch service, everything came through as expected for Harbour Sixty.  You get what you pay for.  We saw some Leafs hanging out at the bar and a couple who sat in front of each other for an hour and a half and did not say more than two words to each other. I guess money doesn't buy you happiness, but it can get you a solid meal."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a beautiful dinner for my anniversary! Portions are a touch on the large side so we had to split a few( was glad the waiter warned us) aside from the steaks which were amazing I must recommend the ribs. I ordered them for myself and was robbed of half by my wife!"}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance of the place. Very (perhaps a bit too much?) solicitous staff: it's like woman, I'd like to enjoy the drink and company without so many queries whether I'm doing ok, but sure. Great bathrooms: I almost didn't want to leave them as well."}
{"text":"Before I start, I must begin with the fact that patrons of Harbour Sixty get complimentary valet parking. You know what a pain parking in downtown toronto can be, so this was a nice touch!

THE FOOD:

Ahi Tuna ($25) - a generous portion of tuna that sits on a bed of smoothly mashed avocado, doused with soya sauce and crunchy sesame seeds. A great app! 

Rib Eye ($58) - Nice colour on the outside, while still being tender and red on the inside. Flavourwise I thought it was a little over-seasoned. 

Creamed Spinach(half portion -$6.50)
Truffle Mac and Cheese(Half Portion -$6.5) -roasted garlic, fresh chillies

I've heard great things about their sides, and I have a feeling I didn't quite order the right ones. Both the Creamed Spinach and Truffle Mac and Cheese were very salty and heavy; making them not-so-great a pairing with a fatty and flavourful steak. I would definitely luck with something lighter next time.

Miso Black Cod($40) - Salty salty salty. Do you get the reoccurring theme yet? Whenever I consume too much sodium I get a weird raw wrinkly feeling on my lips. Almost as if the salt has dehydrated them. I didn't even make it half way through the dish before I had to stop and drink an entire glass of water. And again, the salty sides didn't help with the cause.

Molten Chocolate Cake($14) -Valhrona chocolate, vanilla bean ice cream
I was so excited to order desert because I wanted to finally have something that wasn't entirely sodium. No complaints here, delicious and chocolatey.


THOUGHTS: 
For such an upscale restaurant, I think Harbour Sixty leaves me with a lot to be desired. I was wowed by the restaurant setting, but had a different opinion about the food. Nothing was repulsive, but there isn't much to boast about either. And for the price that was paid, I would much rather take my money to Jacobs and Co, where I don't have to guess if I will get lucky with a good menu item, or a good cut of meat."}
{"text":"In Toronto's historischem Harbour Comission Building befindet sich dieses hervorragende Steakhouse. Das Ambiente, der Service, die Qualität des Essens und der Weine sind absolute Spitzenklasse. Habe schon viele Steakrestaurants ausprobiert aber dieses hat bisher Alle getoppt. Ein Besuch der Website ist vorab zu empfehlen und bietet einen guten Einblick in das was einen dort erwartet. Es sollte ausserdem reserviert werden. Ich schwärme bis heute von dem Besuch in diesem Lokal. Preislich ist das ganze natürlich in der obersten Region angesiedelt aber das ist bei einem solchen Top Restaurant nicht anders zu machen. 5 Sterne! Würde auch 6 geben."}
{"text":"Was here for a birthday dinner , food was alright , we had a flier manon 14 oz and a rib eye steak , portion is huge , we we really full at the end of the dinner , our server was not that attentive ,.we ordered the baked Alaska for dinner , and because we were here to celebrate a birthday , I asked for a happy birthday to be written on the dessert , but they end up did not doing it , by the time the dessert reached the table , I asked again there is suppose to be a happy birthday written on it , the waitress did not offer to take it back to the kitchen and have t written , we were pretty disappointed, paying $300 for the dinner and did not get the service we were expected, we have been to many other steak house in downtown Toronto , hy's Jacob's , and harbour sisxty is definitely not my favourite, will not come back"}
{"text":"You're paying for the best, but:
Not the best you can get around here.
Crab cakes not very good at all.
No sticky toffee pudding on the menu which is not a big deal but a personal favorite."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely astounding. It goes without saying that it is very pricey here. But unlike a lot of very pricey restaurants, you get what you pay for.

I ordered the rib eye steak and had it medium-rare. It was cooked beyond perfection and actually melted in my mouth. Definite moment of euphoria when I took my first bite (...and second and third...). Lol, it was fantastic!! I've had a lot of steaks in the city but this place is the best in my books. The sides are good too but the main reasonably steals the show. 

The service was good and everyone is very courteous. When you walk-in and when you leave, you have many people saying hello/goodbye. There is also very sweet valet workers who do not expect tip (but of course, I tipped them for being so wonderful!). Did I mention valet parking is also free??

The dessert is good but expect smaller portions. Just enough to appease any sugar fix needed. I really liked the chocolate molten cake but at my table, lots of people were fans of the coconut cream pie. 

Finally the ambiance is very modern, posh and romantic.

This is a great place to treat yourself or your loved ones for a tremendously great meal. It is pricey but it's worth every penny. Très bien!"}
{"text":"Harbour Sixty is a Downtown Toronto classic and well known as a top tier steakhouse.  You won't leave without your wallet being much lighter though!  Drinks, Mains, Appetizers and Sides are all quite pricey.

Food - good quality as expected.  Steaks were all cooked and charred appropriately.  

The Broiled Caribbean Lobster Tail is massive and was cooked to proper tenderness and flavour. 

The Bone-in Rib Steak was good but did not stand out to me vs other higher end steak houses.

Asparagus and Broccolini sides were healthy portions and cooked to proper level of crispiness.


Service - top notch and attentive.  Courses were delivered in appropriate intervals with constant check-ins for drinks and other inquiries.


Environment - high-end and well appointed with a Downtown Financial district feel to it."}
{"text":"Pros: The service is great, our waiter was very nice and helpful. The place was fairly busy even on a week night

Cons: The food is TOO overpriced. For the price you pay, you get very mediocre food. The steak consisted of quality meat but it wasn't cooked very well. Despite ordering a medium and medium-well the outside of the steak was burnt and too tough. I think the most pretentious part of the experience was when they brought out an oversized white plate with a little piece of filet mignon in the centre. No presentation, no garnish, no beauty whatsoever. So you pay 55-70 dollars for a little piece of meat that looked like it was prepared and made in a few minutes. You also have to pay for the sides (some are the price of a meal in itself) and is too large for one person to be able to finish.

Overall: The food is good but is worth maybe a third of what it is actually sold for. For their price, I would have expected a very unique experience and food presentation. And if one wants to justify that perhaps you pay for the restaurant experience, the interior is very dim and the furniture is outdated. Also, our view was towards a parking lot....so I ruled out that point (though it may be a matter of different personal taste)"}
{"text":"Decided to have my husbands 40th Birthday dinner here in one of their private rooms - The Commissioners Room located upstairs. I have dined here before so there was no hesitation I made the right choice. 

The service was very attentive and did not miss a beat. The Sommelier approached me as soon as our party arrived to go over some wine options and together we picked out a very delicious bottle to be consumed throughout the night. 

Appetizers are all very good, Burrata, Tempura Shrimp & Crab cakes just to name a few. 
Steaks were all cooked to perfection and the variety of sides ordered for the table were all enjoyed thoroughly. 

The Pastry Chef was nice enough to make a large Nutella Banana Cheesecake for our party (currently on the menu) and people are still talking about how sensational it was. I Would not hesitate to host a private party there anytime in the near future. Excellent!"}
{"text":"The food was every good.  Nice selection of steaks, and very good dessert! We ordered Ahi Tuna, 2x steaks, Baked Alaska."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday evening at 7 PM, valet took the car and was greeted inside by the hostess. It was my first time here and was provided a tour of the restaurant, which was really nice. 

My girlfriend and I ordered the crab cake to start, followed by filet mignon (10oz), New York strip steak, lobster mashed potato, and the baked Alaska for dessert. As for drinks, a glass of champagne and merlot (expect to pay 3-4 times the price for a glass of wine versus elsewhere). 

Crab cake was nice and hot when arriving, was a bit too salty in my opinion. The steak arrived shortly after and was delicious. Hands down one of the best steaks I've ever had, very flavourful and juicy. Lobster mashed potato was also really great, I highly recommend. The portions of the sides are fairly large, so if you are coming as a group sharing would be great! Lastly, we had the baked Alaska for dessert.. It is massive, and flaming brandy is poured over it! From what I recall, it was brownie on the bottom, almond gelato in the middle, and dark chocolate on the top portion. 

To summarize, great first experience.  I would recommend if you're coming here to celebrate something important or special. 4.5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night with my family of 5 ordered 5 appetizers 2 glasses of wine and 1 (one) steak for $500. The food was ok not great, the service was too fast. When you are spending $500 on a snack you don't want to be rushed. 
Next time Ruth's Chris for $500 everyone gets their own steak."}
{"text":"Harbour Sixty did everything right except for one thing. The wine list can make anyone feels like a kid at a candy store. The au d'oeuvres is a delightful collection of expected and unexpected items. The seafood tower can easily win over the most picky guest. The service is friendly and relaxing. The crowd all look like they are having a great time.

Sadly, the only thing they did wrong in this steakhouse is the steak. The chef has lost balance and chose a grill temperature that is just too high so the steaks came out with burnt surface but undercooked center. Incomprehensible mistakes."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday 
SO bad!
The wait staff was horrible,too young and talking in groups all night
The music was bad and too loud,club music
I ordered my steak rare and it came burnt
They could not get my drink right
They knew it was for my birthday and NO dessert was offered
We asked months ago,when we booked,for the lower room,they said we had to sit in the main dining room
Drab and old,NOT a pretty room at all
Over priced and not worth your time or money 
STEER CLEAR 
What a disappointment on my birthday ..............................................."}
{"text":"Fantastic steak, never a disappointment. Sides, seafood, desserts and liquor are no slouch either. Server Nick is always exceeds our expectations. Just be prepared for the bill!"}
{"text":"For a fine dining steakhouse experience a lot was left to be desired and generally an underwhelming experience for what you usually expect from  a premium steakhouse.  

The bone-in rib-eye that was ordered was disappointing to say the least. It was ordered med-rare and came to the table med-well.  Furthermore it was gritty and had a vein that was hard to see in subdued lighting but immediately noticed as I bit into the steak. 

It was company dinner so I elected to not make a big fuss although I did mention it but since we were a party of 12 it was overlooked. 

He appetizers we're ok but definitely a letdown for what you pay. Expected much better. 

Might try again and see if I fare better next time. Willing to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Had a corporate function here for customers.  Food was excellent, serving staff where great.  Somehow, we got way way overbilled.  If you have any corporate or parties here, put a limit on alcohol and then start paying per drink, otherwise your will get a huge huge huge bill.  We've banned our vendors and marketing department from using this place."}
{"text":"It was Valentine's Day and my boyfriend had made a reservation for this special day. As we arrived we were greeted by valet parking. I wanted to park my own car but was told I was not allowed to. I proceeded to park in the parking lot behind the establishment but was told I was not allowed to park here unless I gave my keys to them. After about 5 minutes of poor explanations of why it was mandatory, I gave up my keys. We proceeded inside and were immediately greeted. Before being seated they ask to take you jacket and give you a ticket. We walked around the busy, open kitchen were they actually seat people to dine as the cooks hustle to prepare the food. After being seated and welcomed by our waiter we immediately ordered. LITERALLY 5 mins, no joke, maybe 10 minutes tops, our food arrived. I asked if it was normal for steaks to arrive so quickly, the waiter stated the grills are hot today so they are cooking faster. I had request a medium well filet mignon, it came out past well done and lukewarm. The portions are large but they too were barely warm. The obeisance was very \"high class\" and made you feel like you should tip every stop you made. We were in and out in under 45 minutes. Overall for 2 steaks and 2 sides we paid $200. For this price I would wouldn't recommend this place. Ruth Chris is by far way better quality for the same price."}
{"text":"The steaks are really awesome and they have a great selection of wines too.
Try the shrimp cocktail. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"When I walked in the place it made me feel like it was going to wow me and instead it was just another over priced Steak house. Sure the Steaks where of high quality but the presentation was lacking something. I found the cuts where just to big and not as refine as a 5 star Steak House should be."}
{"text":"This place gone down in last 5 years. Steaks are not up to par anymore, certainly not in this price range. Regular, okay steak. Expectations not met at all. Presentation is slaking.  Take your dollars somewhere else. There are plenty much better steak houses with much better in the same price range. 

The only good things that are still left: Bread basket and wine list. But these will not make me come back anymore. It's not that I did not like it, the place is just not good anymore."}
{"text":"Went to celebrate my husbands birthday sat night. Service started off great but everything went downhill from there.  Wine we ordered was unavailable.  Shrimp cocktail was delicious but at 36$ for 3 shrimp, it should be.  Caesar salad soggy. porterhouse was ordered medium.  It came blue and cold in the center.  Waiter said that is whT their medium is at Harbour 60.  Sent it back and they must have microwaved it as there was little difference except for 2pieces on the edge.  Inedible.   We waited almost 15 min for our bill and we received an apology since he got held up in he kitchen.  One of the worst experiences and meals ever. The bill was close to 400.00 which included a 100.00 bottle of wine.  Will Never return and will be sure to let anyone thinking of going there to run......away!!!! They should go to Wolfgangs in NY at Park and 32nd to see what a great steak should be."}
{"text":"My opinion is that this is one of the great steak houses anywhere in the world, and our visit last Saturday didn't disappoint. 
It had been well over a year since our last visit, so visions of a somewhat dowdy interior lingered; however, upon entering and seeing the remodel for the first time, we're delighted that the decor lives up to the quality of the food and service. They've sort of created a new category; \"contemporary steakhouse.\" Dark wood, lush patterns, sexy lighting. 
A quick shout out to our server, Carmelo, who embodies what every restaurant, anywhere, should strive to provide; friendly, but not obsequious, professional, but not stuffy, knowledgeable, but not pedantic. He rocks, and will definitely be my \"requested station\" in the future.
As great as the steaks are, and it feels like we tried them all, the sides really made the meal. The corn with chipotle - spicy! - is terrific. We also had mashed potatoes, mushrooms, and creamed spinach. For a starter, try the \"Lisa's Salad\" which is a mellower version of a Greek salad. 
We had a petite fillet, porterhouse, bone in fillet, and bone in ribeye. Every steak was served as requested, from very rare to medium. 
The wine list is extensive, and I can't imagine not being able to find something for every taste (though not budget!). 
Bottom line: I'm a fan. The only caveat to the experience is you need to know this is not for the faint-of-heart. It is expensive...VERY expensive, but if you're looking for a restaurant that won't disappoint, steaks, seafood, service, and ambiance, go for the gusto."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere. Great food but lost us when we got the bill for a $327 bottle of wine we did not order. Our host had slipped out to accept a call and upon his return we were treated to a bottle of  wine we each assumed the other had ordered. Our host graciously offered to pay for the bottle but at a VERY reduced rate. Still feeling swindled..."}
{"text":"Great steak. Romantic atmosphere. Definitely a top choice for a special occasion! $$$"}
{"text":"I can honestly say, one of THE best filets I have had at any steakhouse ever! You just have to go here, words don't really do the food any justice.

Amazing service, and more importantly great cocktails! 

The free valet parking doesn't hurt either."}
{"text":"Just finished up a wonderful lunch here with my co workers. The restaurant is beautifully designed but not so easy to navigate. Definitely not wheelchair accessible. I had the seafood salad which was much richer than I had anticipated but still excellent with bug chunks of crab, lobster, shrimp and creamy avocado. For desert I tried one of their specialty coffees, the cherry bomb. It was very sweet and very good. Perfect end to a great meal.  Wish I could tell you something about the price but I didn't pay for it :) #internlife"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I visited this restaurant a while back so the details are a bit fuzzy.

Service was great (not that we'd expect anything less with the price they charge)  The porterhouse was enough to probably feed the two of us plus a few of her cousins and still leave all of us on a full stomach, it was enormous.  Along with the porterhouse, their crabcakes were also to die for."}
{"text":"Harbour Sixty was recommended to me as a good place to go in Toronto for a good steak.  It was way under sold this place was phenomenal!  The best dinning experience that I have had in Toronto and I will be be back.  The filet, shrimp, crab legs were all sampled and all were over the top.  The spread that they serve with the bread is also unique and very good."}
{"text":"Wir waren mit einer größeren Gruppe gleich zweimal im Harbour Sixty gewesen.
Positiv: Das Fleisch war durch die Bank sehr gut, ich hatte ein ausgezeichnetes Filet Mignon, aber auch die anderen (New York Strip, T-Bone usw.) waren ausgezeichnet. Dazu die üblichen Standards für gute Steakhäuser: üppige Beilagen in guter Qualität und eine 1a-Auswahl an Digestifs. 
Exzellent allerdings war der Sommelier: Wir haben zweimal kanadische Weine probiert und waren von der Auswahl/Beratung durch den Weinchef des Hauses sehr begeistert. Zwar können sich diese Weine (noch) nicht mit guten Franzosen messen, aber okay waren sie allemal.
Negativ. Gibts nichts auszusetzen. Allerdings sollte der Esser für dieses Lokal ein gut gefülltes Portemonnaie mitbringen oder eine Kreditkarte mit ordentlich Luft nach oben. :-)
Fazit: Wenn ich wieder in Toronto bin, gehe ich hier mit Sicherheit nochmal hin!"}
{"text":"Such high hopes for this place, but alas. Came for a birthday dinner. Great table near the bar, perfect for people watching. Bread and assorted spreads were delicious. But the truth is, if you are looking for a fancy steakhouse where you can get great food with a great scene and have an all-around awesome experience, go somewhere else.

As for the real food... We ordered: cesaer salad, filet, truffle mac and cheese, broccolini, asparagus, and truffle fries. The food took about 45 mins to come out, but we were enjoying ourselves so didn't think twice. 

My cesaer was completely fine, not made tableside as described in other reviews. The rest of our order was beyond disappointing. The food came out luke warm, and if you've ever had luke warm french fries, you know there is nothing worse than a limp, near soggy fry soaked in truffle oil. Not the way I was hoping to 'splurge.' The bf's steak was also barely warm, which is also not the way a steak is served. The mac & cheese, same... Veggies, same... But really only Maestro's knows how to do veggies.

We said something to our waitress, who was the sweetest, and she took everything but my salad and veggies back. When they brought out round 2, the food was piping hot: fries were crispy, steak was juicy, and mac & cheese not amazing, but better. However, at a place like this with prices like this, round 2 should never have been necessary.

My bf snuck off to order my favorite dessert: the molten lava cake. It was also quite good. 

When the bill came, we were quite surprised (and not in the delighted way) to see that not one thing had been comped, even the birthday cake. I mean, really? After providing a mediocre (they label themselves as 'premier') dining experience, you can't throw in a mini cake??

We emailed the restaurant a few days later to share our experience and nothing. NO RESPONSE. A week later, I tried again and got an offer for a gift card. Unfortunately, we are out of towners with no plans to ever return to Harbour 60 (and if we do return to Toronto, we will go to Jacob & Co as directed). I shared this with Eric, the manager, and he just ignored my email. I tried again (I'm nothing if not persistent!) and got some vague response along the lines of 'too bad, we will only offer a gift card.' And then nothing.  

I had hoped to avoid writing this review, as I assumed our experience was a one-off, but it appears that this restaurant is run on the notion that under-delivering customer service and over-priced food is par for the course. Just save yourselves the trouble and go somewhere worth the $$$. And the calories."}
{"text":"Food was good - can't justify the price!
No real culinary magic going on in the kitchen - just basic steakhouse cooking.  If it were sous vide, or molecular, or innovative then I could see the justification but I'm sure it's just a line cook cranking out steaks. Wine list is outrageous and borders on criminal
Don't think I would return even if I wasn't paying - steak at via allegro is better as is the wine list.  If wine not an issue, mortons or ruths Chris is pretty good."}
{"text":"I love it here! The food is amazing and the staff is incredibly professional. I've always had a great experience here. The steak is unreal and you have to try the molten chocolate lava cake, it will make your week."}
{"text":"Definitely overpriced for what it is, food ok, service meh.  
My first time at the restaurant, went for a friend's birthday with a group of 12. 
I had the beef carpaccio as app- the meats were sticking to the plate and had to be scraped off. Nothing special about the seasoning either. 
New York cut was ok, the portion was huge, it was very tender and juicy, but I don't know if I would pay $70 for that again. We ordered 4 sides to share, and definitely expected more when they charge you $15 for mushrooms or Brussels sprouts. They were just plain button mushrooms, there was nothing special about them. 
I would not visit there again."}
{"text":"Ok, I know this is a steakhouse, but please try the lobster here. Don't be afraid of the \"Market Price\" written next to it on the menu. Embrace that it will cost well over $100 but it will be so worth it. The most amazing lobster I've ever had anywhere. It's huge, perfectly cooked, and oh so delicious."}
{"text":"It's pretty much as you expect for the money.

Nothing to complain in terms of food but in comparison to barbarians it is more expensive...

And no pickled vegetables for appetizers :("}
{"text":"The food is delicious, the New York strip was super flavourful. Went here for a birthday dinner and it was a nice surprise that the waiter sang to me. 

BUT for experience. It's a no for us. For the price and the notoriety this restaurant comes with, we didn't expect for other customers to be playing music loudly on their phones speaker. Not one but TWO tables had to be shushed by other customers. So it was not just us annoyed by the ignorance."}
{"text":"Good not great and for the price it should be great. Service was just ok. We will not be coming back. I actually think ruth chris may be better and a better value"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here while we were visiting Toronto September 2013. My husband had just discovered his love of Old Fashions earlier that year and asked for one from the bartender- 3yrs later, he still raves it was the best drink he's ever had at a restaurant!! 
We had such a lovely time there, we didn't wait long for our 8:30pm reservation and were sat at a quiet table along the window. Quiet is a loose term since it was a crowded restaurant, but I never had to yell to hear my husband or the waiter. 
Food was delicious and the sommelier's wine recommendation was divine. We will definitely return if we ever make it back to Toronto!!"}
{"text":"Took the Mr. here for his birthday and we were both left very disappointed. 

Food: Steaks were low quality and lacked flavour. I had the bone in tenderloin and was expecting the meat to melt in my mouth but it tasted really grainy and was difficult to cut. Also, the presentation was off putting, as the steaks are served on a big white plate and all the sides have to be ordered separately. The sides are a la carte at Jacobs as well, but their steaks are served on a cast skillet with the option of being pre-sliced which just looks more high end. I also recommend that Harbour Sixty offer an assortment of salts and sauces to go with their steaks as they are not flavourful enough to eat on their own. It literally felt like i was just eating chunks of meat with no seasoning. I barely ate it and filled up on the sides instead. 

Service: this one was the kicker and what the server did at the end of the night has still left me reeling, but let me start from the beginning. Service was slow from the minute we sat down. It took a good 10min to just get water and drinks. 

The server checked up on us maybe once the whole meal and we had to flag him down all the other times we needed something.Since it was the Mr.'s bday I went up to our server privately to see if they could write \"Happy Birthday\" on his dessert plate ( i've seen this done on instagram photos with the Baked Alaska that we ordered) The server said of course but when we got our dessert, there was no message on the plate. He tried to play it off that I had wanted a candle but there was no need for a candle bc our dessert was flambéed. I told him that wasn't what I asked for and he just shrugged it off. Not impressed. 

Now comes the bill. Our meal came to $360 incl tax. With a cheshire cat grin, the server hands me the credit card machine and advises me that the tip has already been included. WTF??!!! I have NEVER heard of auto gratuity for 2 people. He basically tipped himself 20% for sub par service. After I paid, he asked if I liked my caesar drink which is still 3/4 full. I said no, and feigning concern, he asks if I want another couple drinks at the bar. Ummm, maybe he should have asked earlier when we're not about to leave. 

The only thing good about this place is the heated toilet seats. How fitting that the only positive aspect was related to my ass. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place is a suckers game for the rich. I went with my family of 5 ordered 9 appetizers, ONE steak and 4 glasses of alcohol = $500.
Lobster Chowder - strange after taste
Ceasar Salad - Romain Lettuce swimming in Kraft dressing with a large plastic piece of cheese
Calamari - Keg like quality
Shrimp Cocktail- tasty but not at $9 a shrimp
Tuna Tartar - A mound of raw tuna with squirt of wasabi sauce - go to any good sushi place and get it done right for a third of the price
The rest of my appetizers - Fries, mashed potatoes and 6 oysters
My ONE steak - Warm in the middle (directly in the middle) and over cooked all around - you want good steak go to Morton's or Ruth Chris and get butter like steak at a fraction of the price.

Service - Ordered our appetizers - within 10 min. all of them showed up on our small table plates on top of plates. I had to tell them to slow down the service and take back a few of them until there's room and until we finish a few. Normally at these type of restaurants plates are cleared asap once finished, new plates and cutlery are replaced frequently (Not here).

Atmosphere - dark with one lane for guests and servers to walk up and down. It was like a subway station right by our table.

You want old style Surf and Turf food go to Morton's, Ruth Chris or even the Keg.

George Brown Food and Beverage Graduate"}
{"text":"One of the best places in town for a steak. Always an amazing meal and excellent service."}
{"text":"I really didn't hear much about Harbour Sixty before I went, so I had no idea what to expect. From the time that we arrived to the time that we left, we were treated with excellent service. With complimentary valet and two staff who escorted us to the patio to just have a place to smoke while we waited for the rest of our party to get there, I knew that the actual restaurant service would be impressive. 

And it was. The wine adviser (I think he may be the manager, who knows... but I'll go by what he introduced himself as) sat down with us and guided us through the wine list, then proceeded to hold a great conversation with us for the rest of the evening. 

And the food? I had just been to Micheal's the previous week and paid the exact same, if not more for a meal that was weak in flavor and quantity. In total I ordered a $58 bottle of wine (one of the cheaper options... and it still tasted delicious) a 10oz Sirloin cooked medium rare (it's quite thick so it does come almost rare) and the four ladies I was with ordered the same; all agreeing to being pleased with the steak. We each ordered different sides and since they come big enough to share we got to have some of each. The fries are absolutely delicious! My second favourite was the beets and the sauteed mushrooms, and the garlic mashed potatoes were good and complimented the steak extremely well.     

I had a wonderful evening; I'd suggest getting a booth for more comfort (and requesting it in your reservation) but this is by far one of my new favorite restaurants. definitely a place to impress a date or a business partner. 

Loved it."}
{"text":"Great place ... A little pricy !! great smoking section.. I recommend u sit at the bar for dinner they have a dj so much fun.  I tried so many restaurants hard to compete with harbor .. 
Do not order market price. Big scam. At least 200$$$$. Or more. Drinks are 25$ and up. 
They have slowed down a lot since hockey stopped , or people aren't spending like they used too. 
 A must try j"}
{"text":"Would have given 4 stars if not for the service.  The food here was very good, but I experienced a long delay before I got my meal.  Other tables seated after us got their food way before we did.  As far as the meal, a top notch piece of steak (almost worth the wait) and the sides were very good.  Yes, H60 is a touch pricey, but there are some chain steakhouses that charge almost as much.  Definately worth the extra $5-10 for the entrees.

The place was on the dressy side, but did not feel stuffy."}
{"text":"Food is overly priced but the venue is just beautiful. Booked one of the private dining rooms downstairs and the staff were very accommodating. Was able to hire third party entertainment (a guitarist) to perform for us throughout dinner. I would visit here again if renting out the private rooms to impress guests/party but I can't say I'd return because of the food."}
{"text":"Wanted a nice steak and i got it. My Ribeye was perfectly cooked and the spinach was just as good. I thought the service was fast and the staff was extremely friendly. My waiter spooned the spinach on my plate. While I could have done it myself, I didn't stop him. it was a little pricey but worth every dime."}
{"text":"If your looking to eat at one of the top steak houses in Toronto this is one of them

From the moment you walk in you know you are in a top Dining establishment, the ambiance is fantastic 

For starters we had we had the jumbo tempura shrimp and the calamari, along with that came some olives, feta and some hot peppers, all very tasty 

For our mains (because we were 4) we had the double porterhouse with garlic mash, mac and cheese,  broccoli and rapini for sides 

The steak was cooked perfect and all the sides were as expected, really enjoyed the mac and cheese had a hint of truffle oil

All in all you will not have a bad meal here, I've had the pleasure of my fair share of visits and it's been good.... even after a busy sporting event or concert they still pull it off"}
{"text":"If you enjoy a great Steak, Harbour Sixty will not disappoint you. I have been here a few times now and love their food and service. The enormous shrimp cocktail (think it is sized 4-6) is fantastic. They are perfectly chilled and the sauce has a nice lemon/horseradish mix. The baseball filet is to die for, perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. They use a broiler that hits 1500 degrees, so the juices gets trapped in the meat instantly. For dessert you have to try the baked Alaska. 

The service and food is some of the best in the city!"}
{"text":"Favourite restaurant in the city. Romantic, elegant and delicious. 

Tip - You can order half sides so you can try more (and not waste as much - they're generous portions)."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the most overpriced establishments I have ever been to. The steak is similar quality to the steak at the Keg. So the question becomes, why not just go to the Keg?!!! Very stuffy decor and service. Also I'm pretty sure that my sister got food poisoning from her meal. She was throwing up excessively an hour after our visit, which lasted all through the night. Never going back again!"}
{"text":"Been there twice, the recent visit is horrible, order the Kobe beef, 0 quality!!!! It is a breakfast steak!!!! Go buy some from local Japanese supplier and cook for yourself. 
Automatic charged 25% tip!!!! 
Terrible service too, no reaction to whatever you suggest. 
All in all, no taste, no class. just wait to get your money."}
{"text":"All in all a good meal but not a great meal.  At these prices I would say I expected a little more.  

The service was good - everyone was nice, my water glass was always full, and we didn't wait too long for the food.  I had a porterhouse and the wife a filet - parts of my \"medium\" steak were rare and too chewy.  The filet was reported as really good by the wife, who is fairly picky.  We had sides of the Mac & Cheese and the Sugar Snap Peas - the former really tasty but would have liked a slightly larger portion given the prices; the latter was seasoned with too much garlic for our taste.  The Molten Chocolate Cake was made fresh, so it took about 15 mins to arrive, but was extremely yummy.  Again I was left wishing it was a little bit bigger.  

One more tip - we went on a last minute whim and when I called in they did warn me that all they had was a table by the bus-person's station.  What this meant was that all night we were treated to the \"crash-crash\" of dished being dumped into the dishwasher's station in the kitchen.  My wife and I were laughing the whole time.  The space is beautiful and I recommend you DON'T accept such an option if it's offered to you - better to just choose another restaurant!  But I will not take off for this, because we were warned (sort of)!"}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the burger.  Got if fully loaded(bacon and cheese I believe).  Not very flavourful.
Not worth the hype, it was a good burger but not a 22$ one.  Many better burger options in the city at a much lower price.  Steaks looked really good, maybe next time."}
{"text":"Sexual harassment is a BIG issue at this restaurant. The man who works Valet by the name of Ali is a huge pervert. He has tried to kiss customers like myself and other waitresses when no one is around. The employees are afraid to come forward. It's very sad that the MANAGER/OWNER doesn't protect his/her employees regarding this matter. There are several women who have been assaulted by this pervert but are too afraid to say anything. To ALL THE WOMEN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED SIMILAR EXPERIENCES Please come forward. I WILL NO LONGER SUPPORT THIS RESTAURANT. MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY will no longer be going to Harbour Sixty. I hope they confront Mr. Ali once and for all. Sexual assault towards customers, employees or anyone for that matter is a big No No. I hope Teddy, Lisa or Manager Amy do something about this matter."}
{"text":"I love Harbour Sixty! I think I've been here 4 times and service and food have been consistently good. I don't feel it's overpriced, and I do think you get a ton of value in terms of quality and portion size. 

The truffle fries are to die for.... 
You must must save room for coconut cream pie! It's just divine. I'm usually so full by this point that I wanna hurl but will still stuff the pie down LOL. 

I have yet to try the baked Alaska which looks insane. 

I loved all the sides I've had -  biggest tip is that these all come in half size orders! Take advantage as full size is humongous... Plus, half orders = more variety!

Foie gras errthang!"}
{"text":"As already mentioned but other reviewers, Harbour Sixty is very pricey. It's still worth a try if you love your meat so that you can compare it with other steakhouses. Personally, I preferred the Rib Steak from Peter's and Jacob's since I found them more flavourful and better value. However, the meat from Harbour Sixty was the most evenly marbled so I didn't bite into any tough part or sinew and the knife sliced into the meat easily.

We ordered the Burrata (mozzarella and cream) appetizer which came out to $36. We should have asked for the price before ordering. Even though it was delicious and flown all the way from Italy, I could not justify this ridiculous price tag. Also, make sure you order \"tap water\" if you don't wish to get charged for water. Our server asked us if we liked sparkling or still. We answered still water since we assumed that was the free one. However, still water actually came from a fancy bottle and costs $10. 

So, be careful what you order! My advice is to stick to the following items on the menu so that you leave happy and feeling you got your money's worth.
1) Truffle fries - generous portion even for half-size order and you can taste the difference from the Truffle oil and grated Parmesan
2) Steak - meat is top quality and cooked perfectly to the right temperature
3) Baked Alaska - large shareable dessert that is flamed table-side; ice cream inside is very creamy and rich"}
{"text":"Phenomenal. This is NOT like other steak houses. The decor and ambiance is very comfortable and beautiful. Bidet toilets in the women's room. The service is excellent, crumber for the table, fresh cracked pepper, wine poured once your glass gets low, complete attention to detail. The \"bread\" that's brought is a full olive and cheese spread. The caesar salad is delicious. The scallops are cooked to perfection and the pairings on the plate were unbelievable. The Chilean sea bass was crisped and tasty, with a seamless and unbreakable sauce. The truffle mac and cheese was delightful and light. I did not think H60 was more expensive than any other great steak house. Amazing meal and date night out."}
{"text":"An odd little place. I can't put my finger on it between the strange decor, food, vibe - something just didn't do it for me. Maybe it was the outrageous prices on the menu. Food was good, wine was nice, service was prompt. But I did get sticker shock when the bill.  This is an Expense Account kind of place."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place was just OK. It is super overpriced, we had the steak with the fried egg and truffles which was pretty good... but the lobster tail was not worth the $100 price tag, it was honestly so ..\"meh!\" We were seated on what seemed like a nice table by a heater, however, that heater that was blasting hot air at us, we were so uncomfortable! We didn't feel like having everything moved to a new table so we stayed put. The waiter was OK too, not as attentive and friendly as we would have expected. This place needs some upgrading to justify its price tag."}
{"text":"My wife and I consider ourselves to be foodies. While we don't like to
spend $250-400 at a restaurant ever week, we do enjoy spoiling each
other on occasion.

We both love steak, and pride ourselves in trying the best steakhouses
in the city (and outside of the city).

We our visit to Harbour 60 was well over due.

We decided to spend out 7th year anniversary there this past weekend
and were not impressed.

Service- free valet parking - bonus. But when youre directed into the
back of the restaurant and have no one to welcome you - very odd.
After we managed to find our way upstairs and through two doors we
finally found a hostess. No welcome or hello. Just - reservation? Yes
and thank you.

Even though we were celebrating our anniversary and requested a window
seat at reservation - we get seated in a 5 person booth, despite the
restaurant being only 1/3 full. Oh well.

Waiter - personality of a door knob. No welcome - just trying to rush
us to order. Must have come about 7 times to get our order in 15 mins.
Hello have you seen the wine book? It may take me a few mins to choose
a bottle!

Free apps - amazing bread selection. And amazing chucks of feta. Good job!

Paid apps - lobster bisque - mediocre. Tasted like canned vegetable
soup with chunks of lobster.
Caesar salad - decent, but come on its a Caesar salad.

Steak - we ordered their famous steak, as per recommended by the
waiter, the bone in ribeye.
Ordered medium. Received as rare to medium rare and barely warm.

We're trying to enjoy the evening so we try to eat it but barely can
finish a third because its so cold and undercooked.
I told the waiter that it was cold and ill take it home to cook it
properly to see if he'll get the joke - but no. He says. \"Okay.\" And
brings it back in a box.

Dessert - we order the donuts. Pretty good but who can screw up fresh
donuts? The caramel sauce was amazing though.

And again - this is the first restaurant I've ever been to on our
anniversary that we were not presented with a complimentary dessert or
glass of champagne etc. not looking for freebies but still, would a
happy anniversary kill them?

All in all - nice location. Nice place. But bad service and bad food,
especially for what you pay.

Not impressed.

Ps - excuse my spelling and grammar as I'm using my iphone. Thx."}
{"text":"Amazing! We started off in the bar, they have bacon out for bar snacks! It was soooo good. The decor in this place is GLAM x100. We had a private dining room, the octopus, short ribs, filet, and tagatelle pasta were delicious. This is the perfect place for a fancy date, birthday or business dinner to impress. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This review is about 6 months overdue as my visit occurred back in February when I had a near perfect birthday dinner here with a good friend and my parents. My friend had raved about this spot for ages and finally convinced us to go here to celebrate my birthday (OK, twist my arm - I'll go to one of the best steakhouses in Toronto for my birthday... sure!). 

It's location slightly hidden by Gardiner Exprwy above and is nestled between Queens Quay and Lakeshore Ave. While it's not impossible to find, it will require some intermediate navigation skills with all the road closures and one way streets in the area. It's interesting to see this historic building (Which I'm sure at one point stood out) is now hidden amidst the roads and high rises of \"newer\" Toronto.

If you're stressed out after figuring out how to get there, the H60 staff takes the stress off your shoulders the minute you pull in with optional valet parking service available.

Entering into the building it's gorgeous, I was struck by images of the Plaza Hotel in NYC or the Fairmont Royal York here in Toronto. Classic Old world charm, sophistication with a slightly modern touch. The most impressive feature to me upon entering their main lobby was the cabinets on either side of the foyer displaying the largest, most expensive (And extensive) scotch selection, I've come in contact with. I mean a Maccallan 55??? I didn't even know that existed! Even more vast and even more impressive was their wine selection, which occupied not just cabinets, but closets and even whole rooms, each bottle tagged individually with their name and price.

We chose to dine on the less pretentious, more casual bar side, which even as a bar, is still a classier dining experience than 95% of places in the city.

After corking a couple bottles of wine we were all thoroughly impressed by the standard table starter, consisting of Feta cheese with hot peppers on top, a garlic-parmigiano cheese spread and an assortment of olives. Delicious

After giving our orders to the server she encouraged us to take a tour of the fresh seafood and steak counter. If you like, you can pick the exact seafood and/or steak you'll be dining on that evening. I picked my own Rib-steak like I was picking out my favourite puppy from a litter.

I should note that their seafood appears to either be from the deepest depths of the ocean OR from neat a power plant - Easily the biggest lobster tails (not lobsters) I've seen, (see my photo for scale against a standard bic lighter). Basically the size of a child's arm. Insane.

To start, I had the Harbour Caesar salad appetizer. It was beautifully presented, but I found the use of more yellowish/white romaine to be underwhelming. This would be the only thing I take off a mark for. The dressing was great as well but I felt the \"best caesar salad in the city\" should have been a little better than this in terms of the lettuce used.

My mild dismay was only short lived because my handpicked ribeye steak soon arrived with a perfect char on the outside and the most perfect medium rare on the inside. I paired that massive cut of meat with the decadent lobster and brie mashed potatoes which, quite honestly, were so good that it made me reconsider my direction in life, my religious beliefs, political affiliation, my sexuality and my career choices. Forget ideas of gravity that mash flipped me on my head...

Just when I couldn't possibly smell another bite, let alone eat another one, dessert and a birthday song arrived. Two desserts to be exact 1) Baked Alaska. set on fire right at the table was was an amazing spectacle to be seen, as was 2) My slice of coconut cream pie (a new fave) which was thicker than my earlier ingested 2 inch ribsteak.

I can't be sure what this night of decadence came to, but I know it was spendy. So a heartfelt thank you goes out to those who covered the cheque. This meal took 2-5 years off my life but they were years well enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Been to h60 a few times and decided to write a review based on my latest visit. Staff/Service was friendly, unpretentious, knowledgable wait staff, overall our meal was good. 

Ordered the Beluga Caviar to start which was amazing. Blinis were really well prepared, served with chopped soft boiled eggs, onions and creme fraiche. Entrees and sides were really good as well  - 10 ounce fillet, Halibut, fois grois poutine and lobster mash. For those with rendered fat phobia do not order the poutine! The fries are literally submerged in all the fat that's been rendered from the goose liver. Or if you do make sure to order wine to cut through it. 

A complementary basket of bread, and platter of pickled peppers, olives, feta, and garlic spread is provided at the beginning of the meal. For first timers, ask your server for the bacon strips. The restaurant prepares it's own bacon smoked in house. They are so good we almost ended up not ordering entrees and making bacon sandwiches instead."}
{"text":"What an amazing dining experience. Our server(cant remember her name) was incredibly helpful. I love the decor of  the restaurant. All of the staff were brought their A-game to the table. The food was amazing. They even had HP sauce for the steak which should make it 5.5*/6

{"text":"TL/DR meh food, meh service, aims for style and service but fails at both


Like the atmosphere, the food was fine but not amazing. We had the Caesar salad and the calamari to start. Both were served promptly and thrown down on the table like we were a couple of pigs at a trough. For mains we both had the filet mignon with sides of truffle fries and Brussels sprouts. The fries were mushy and the Brussels sprouts were over cooked. Again food was just tossed down on the table.  However we can't fault the waiter by this time he was embroiled in a conflict with another table and spent most of his time behind the bar complaining to the other staff.  

 I don't mind spending several hundred dollars on a meal, but you better deliver. I feel sorry for the couples who are breaking the bank for a special night here or the professional who wants to impress a client. Take your money and run. Leave it for the trust fund kids and hapless social climbers."}
{"text":"This place is expensive so if you go, be prepared for exceptional food and drink, but a high price tag.

Steak was absolutely fantastic.  The best in this area.  Sides were also excellent.  Didn't have an appetizer or dessert.

We did have a bottle of wine.  While good, they take the price of a bottle of wine and multiply it by five.

Definitely a quality restaurant, but essentially you are paying extra for status and not sitting with the regular folk.  I won't go back based on price, but it was definitely good."}
{"text":"girl meets steak

I have an intense and passionate relationship with steak. I love it.  What's a girl to do then when her time is up in Toronto and she hasn't tried all the steakhouses.  Simple, she turns to her friends to help her narrow down the field.

Sidebar: Of the ones I have tried, I loved House of Chan.  I like Ruth's Chris  and I enjoy  mainstream joints like the Keg and Canyon Creek.  I'm not a fan of Morton's or Le Biftheque.

My shortlist was Jacobs, Ruby Watch Co, Barberians and Harbour Sixty.  I surveyed 100 Facebook friends and Harbour Sixty won the majority by 1 vote, Barberians was second and Jacobs was third.  I nixed the latter since most people raved about the table caesar.  Greens are secondary to me.

My friend Minnie and I headed to Harbour Sixty on my Final Friday (in Toronto), and it couldn't have been a more perfect finale.  I'd go back for an encore if I could.

It was one of the best meals I've had - starting with the impeccable service.  Comfortable, not stiff; polite, not awkward; attentive, not over-bearing; and professional, not pretentious.

It does come at a bit of a premium, but it served some of the best classic steakhouse sides I've had, and my ribeye (bone-in) was perfectly medium-rare.

The Golden Beet Salad was a nice twist on a classic.  Instead of just beets and goat cheese, they use a mould and create a trifle like salad.  

The Seared Ahi Tuna was fresh with a nice acidic bite.

We chose the broccolini, fries, and the mac-and-cheese.  The latter was a star.  I usually find mac-and-cheese overrated, but this one was bursting with flavour.

We paired dessert with coffee, and if presentation is any indication of the quality at Harbour Sixty, the coffee platter said it all.  Beautifully, impeccably laid out.  It's always about the details.

A perfect end to my Toronto adventure.  Be yelping from the other side...Vancouver that is."}
{"text":"Good wine selection with a load of options on the menu. Made a great vodka martini. I really didn't bother scanning the menu. Wanted to try the steak. Cannot say enough about the steak. Was tender and cooked as I wanted it -medium.  Juicy and flavourful it was one of those I savoured every bite. I had a salad before this but the waiter took it away before I even had the chance to say I'm not finished. Didn't vocalize but I was probably holding up the crowd. Buffalo cheese and tomatoes. Caprese style salad was a melt-in-your-mouth. 
Good food and ambiance for a pricier crowd."}
{"text":"Very good...overpriced...but convenient if going for a game at the ACC."}
{"text":"Um I wanted this to be better. Granted, the food was absolutely divine, and our sommelier gave us the perfect wine to complement the dinner without making us feel like we weren't worth his time because we weren't about to spend $1G. So the meal was fantastic, service great. But the patrons there are so douchey that I don't think I'll go back, since it comes off as just another greasy club, untz untz and all. Which is kind of too bad."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for a get together or special occasion. I came here with a few friends and we all ordered a few large dishes to share.

The food was fantastic. I'm a HUGE fan of tomatoes. I also can't stand it when restaurants serve unripe tomatoes!! Not here. The tomatoes were ripe and perfectly grilled to my satisfaction!

The steak was...So good....I almost had an orgasm! I don't usually eat meat but I love a good steak.

Then came the Crème Brulee with Tahitian vanilla crème, and citrus lace cookies.....Oh boy!!

I also  noticed a few pro Hockey players that were super hot! If I wasn't with my boyfriend,  I would probably had that orgasm!

Haha!"}
{"text":"I love harour sixty. it's such an old world charming place. I also love that for a steak house, it offers a wide array of selection in other dishes (I hate going to steak houses when I'm not in the mood at the insistence of my company and not having any options). 
And of course, everything is super delicious and the service is always impeccable."}
{"text":"The food is simply amazing.  I had the halibut and my colleague and I split the short rib appetizer.  The halibut may have been the best I have ever had - moist and excellently prepared.  The short ribs were excellent as well.  The whole thing necessitated extra time in the gym the next morning, but it was well worth it.  Be prepared for some sticker shock, but both the service and meal were excellent."}
{"text":"By far one of the best restaurants I have ever been to.

I still think of the coconut pie.  I long for the day I can eat more pie!

There wasn't a bad bite of food.  I savored every one.  While I love steak, I couldn't resist the tuna, which was amazing.

The waitress with a tattoo of \"7\" on her arm was real and not pretentious.  She was well versed in the menu and drink offerings.  

Anyone visiting Toronto shouldn't miss this gem."}
{"text":"Unfortunately not as good as expected.  The price is super high but 3 different steaks all were in a low quality and bad taste. The meats were not as good as it should be, the fish was good and burger delicious, but a steak house is expected to be good at steak which it wasn't... You pay good money for good quality!!"}
{"text":"I came to Harbour Sixty last week and the food was really good!  The steak melted in your mouth. It was cooked perfectly!  I ordered the Pan Roasted Arctic Char. The fish was lacking some flavour but the sides that it came with were delicious!  I loved the flavours of the salsa verde and the Jerusalem artichoke. It made the dish spectacular.  To enhance the flavour of my fish I added lemon and lime. 

My friends steak was to die for. I wasn't craving steak since it was 10pm but if I go there again, I will make sure I'm there earlier so I can order a steak. 

We started with the shrimp cocktail and it was delicious. The shrimps were huge and  scrumptious. I highly recommend that appetizer. It comes with three jumbo shrimps so if you have a bigger party, you may want to order a few. 

We also ordered a side of asparagus and mashed potatoes. The asparagus was really good!  I loved them. Unfortunately, I couldn't try the mashed potatoes because they had dairy in them but my friend said they were really good.

Allover, I would definitely return to Harbour Sixty to enjoy a nice dinner. 

Tips:
If I had to choose between Harbour Sixty and Ruth Chris. I would definitely go back to Harbour Sixty!

Valet parking is free. Just remember to tip the driver."}

{"text":"I have to say, the Baked Alaska is definitely awesome. However, putting the rest of the food vs. price in perspective will not give you the fair balanced answer. It's technically over priced for the quality and presentation of food they serve you. You can either find better or on par level dishes at many other restaurants in Toronto, for much lower rates. The service is great in my opinion, they provide what you expect from a fine dining restaurant. So if you place the pieces of puzzle together,  you can say its premium priced for something that is not at a premium level."}
{"text":"This was suppose to be Christmas celebration dinner with my wife. Having been to Jacob's, I was expecting a similar experience at least in terms of the atmosphere and environment. However, it was very loud there and we didn't feel it was a \"fine steakhouse\"

Pros
Very good service from our server
Crab cake and the truffle fries were delicious

Cons
Other guests were very loud
NOT baby friendly due to loud environment
Would not recommend for a nice quiet romantic dinner

{"text":"Went to Harbour 60 for my boyfriend's birthday.  Was shocked to see that the restaurant was barely full on a Friday evening... Perhaps it was because our reservations were for 9pm.  We ordered the New York strip steak, the salmon with cauliflower puree, Lobster mashed potatoes, White truffle mac and cheese, and a starter salad.  The salad wasn't the tastiest, very light on dressing and rather small.  The other portions were great-  the steak was cooked medium rare, a little bit chewy, but the salmon was cooked to perfection!  The sides were big enough for two... we took a doggie bag home because it was just so much food!  We will be returning, but in the meantime, will probably try other popular steakhouses.  Prices were as expected."}
{"text":"Delicious.

I was in Toronto for a conference at the Westin Harbour. This restaurant was right around the corner, so we decided to give it a try. I am so glad we did. I wasn't even hungry, but this was by far the best steak I've had. 

This restaurant will my new go-to when in Toronto. You must try it if you are in the area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Harbour Sixty for the first time for our anniversary. I was overall very impressed! The decor is beautiful, our waiter was very attentive with good recommendations, and the food was delicious! Our steaks were cooked to perfection. The apps are pretty big portions so we ordered a couple to split. Valet parking was a nice touch. We will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"For the amount you pay it is not worth it. The decor is tacky and the tables are way too close together. The service is ok at best. Food is mediocre. Will never go back. Maybe it was like this because today is Valentines Day but still not up to the standards of a proper steakhouse. Don't order the beef tartare it is tasteless and icey, served with burnt bread."}
{"text":"I also read some of the mediocre reviews and thought maybe they had an off night or were overly critical, but we also had a mixed experience at Harbour 60 recently. Full disclosure we went on New Years day 2017 for dinner with 4 adults and 2 children. I still love the ambiance and venue of this restaurant and this was my 3rd or 4th visit here. The service was very good but we noted 3 negatives in some of the dishes we ordered. First and most importantly the medium prime rib we ordered was quite lean ( not the way you want good beef)  and arrived luke warm. My wife whispered that it was not as good as what she has at the Keg! Second my nephew ordered a burger which he said was fantastic but the bun was slightly stale ( could be because New Years Day fell on a Monday?  but still disappointing considering the price ) . Lastly 2 of the 3 side dishes came out luke warm and brought out in unappealing metal baking dishes which my wife and my sister noted were unbecoming of a fine dining restaurant and more suited to a casual Indian restaurant....lol   ( ironically I didn't really notice this until they pointed it out to me).  When we explained our disappointment regarding the prime rib to our waiter, he removed the the prime rib dish and offered to replace it with another choice but we already had more food than we could finish so we declined. 

On the positive side the Ribeye steak was the best that my wife has ever tasted and my Arctic Char was very good. I followed up with the on duty manager a few days later to let her know about the short comings that we experienced that evening, and they offered an apology and kindly invited us back with a complimentary gift card. Overall I think that the owner of Harbour 60 should drill down on some of the short comings as clients expect 5 star service and food at this elevated price point and the competition is getting more intense with STK and Jacobs putting the heat on the established players Hy's , Morton's , Ruth Chris."}
{"text":"Awesome steak and service!probably the best in town

love the Baked Alaska which is absolutely amazing, even though the outside taste not good...recommended coconut pie is very good,must have a try"}
{"text":"So as predicted the food here was amazing. I had the Kansas steak and wow, it was massive and phenomenal!

Prices were obviously expensive given the elite status of this place but cest la vie!

Highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to celebrate. Also perfect spot to take a clients for business meetings !"}
{"text":"Pure amazingness.....I know that is not a word, but words should definitely be made up for this place!

Superb steak and seafood.

I love the counters where you can pick which steak you want and also choose your seafood.

Alas, very pricey and should not be entered unless you have a wallet FULL :)"}
{"text":"If you like over-priced CRAP and TERRIBLE customer service...this place is for you.

We took clients...bill was $1,000...food came out late..their solution was to give us basically $50 off.  I called the manager to ask for our meal to be comp'd as we had been their before many times and never had a problem...and manager laughed at me.  She said she talked to the owner about it and he said he \"didn't want people like us at his restaurant anyway.\"

Well...no worries...we're never coming back....jerk."}
{"text":"The dining area was very condense, couldn't pull your chair out without hitting something. The Caesar salads was below par.  The Dover sole was lightly pan seared and was average.   The fillet mignon was cooked medium rare, the way I liked it, but again, nothing special.     

One positive thing was their wine list."}
{"text":"Our friends came here for Christmas Dinner and we had reserved the Commissioners Room on the second floor.  What a great room, perfect for dinner with10 - 15 guests.  The girls complained it was a little creepy going to the washroom because of the dark hallway, but nevertheless, we were here for the steak!

Apps/sides:
Olives/Cheese platter
We shared the Seafood Tower which was great (but little overpriced)
Sauteed Brocollini very tasty
Parmesan Truffled Fries - Uhhh... soooo good
Truffled Mac and Cheese
Lobster Mashed Potatoes
Buffalo Mozzarella

Main
The Bone-In Rib Eye was my favorite which was exceptional
Beef Tenderlion was so tender that you didn't need their knife

Desert 
N/A sooo full!

I would recommend any of the above... This place is a little pricy so, resist the temptation to ordering everything from the menu :)

Free Valet Parking / Extensive Wine List / Great Service / Model Like Hostesses ; )"}
{"text":"I have long wanted to dine at Harbour Sixty.  Tonight would be that night!  After having had a disappointing meal at Kom Jug Yuen Restaurant in Chinatown, we decided to come for dessert as I have heard many rumours about how gastronomically amazing their Coconut Cream Pie was.

I had also heard about the astronomical prices of dining at Harbour Sixty but after having had a cheap meal (in every sense of the word), I was prepared to dole out for something good.

Luckily the kitchen was not closing down early tonight and we managed to nab a table.  The restaurant has a nice patio, but it was a bit cool outside so we did not get to enjoy it.  The restaurant is located on the ground floor of the Toronto Port Authority building.  The number of windows, and the doors make it feel like you are on a boat of some sort.  The decor is old school, and the environment is more suited towards the business crowd than it is for an intimate or romantic dinner.  The crowd is also a little bit older, and it is neither a chic nor trendy place to dine.  With that said, the service was stellar.  We were not treated differently even though we had only intended on ordering dessert.  But after perusing the menu, and feeling a bit peckish, we ordered the Foie Gras Poutine to share.  At $40 a plate, my expectations were high.  Yes I know - I am crazy.  I mean who pays $40 for a wee piece of foie gras, and fries covered in cheese and gravy?  The answer is - me!  Anyone who knows me knows I adore foie gras and cheese.  I admit, I also felt guilty for coming in to the restaurant just for dessert which prompted me to order it.

Upon ordering, we were brought a bread basket.  They had a raisin and nut bread that was to die for!  Bonus?  The bread was warm!  It came served with black olives, green olives, and feta cheese that was adorned with pickled green chilis.  The feta was presented in full block form - not its usual crumbled state.  The butter was piped into a tiny serving dish and was extremely spreadable.  Yummy bread.The title of best foie gras poutine still belongs to Au Pied de Cochon in Montréal, but Harbour Sixty's comes in at a close second.  The fries were thin-cut fries topped with marbled cheese (not curd form), gravy, peppercorns and finally adorned with a slab of foie gras.  The foie gras was cooked to a melt-in-your-mouth consistency while I was melting inside with every bite.  I really liked the inclusion of peppercorns in the gravy as it really enhanced the overall flavour of the dish without overpowering the cheese and gravy.  It may have been overpriced for what it was, but I'm glad I ordered it.  I don't know how one could possibly have a main and order this as a side - the portion size was generous to an already heavy side dish.  This for me was a meal in and of itself.

At Harbour Sixty, keeping in common practice with upscale dining establishments, sides are not included and are charged separately.  The pros are that you can order a few side dishes to sample and share, the con is obviously the added cost.  The poutine was the most expensive side dish on the menu.  The cheapest rang in at around $9.To finish off the evening, we ordered the Coconut Cream Pie.  Anyone who loves coconut, and even those who don't, will fall in love.  Their dessert menu is classified in 2 categories: Made Today or Made to Order.  The pie fell into the Made Today category.  It is served with a side of seasonal berries, a milk chocolate drizzle and shaved white chocolate.  It is fluffy on top, but the coconut cream was so amazing I was speechless.  You could taste the (fresh) coconut in the pie, none of that coconut flakes nonsense!  The pie crust was flaky and also had bits of coconut incorporated into it.  This with a cup of their amazing coffee (I dare say it is the best restaurant coffee I've ever had, and I further add that it is better than some of the coffee I've had at artisanal coffee shops).  It was a bold coffee that was full-bodied and rich without being bitter.  I had mine black, and it was a great accompaniment to dessert.  The coffee itself comes with a biscotti and mini cookie.  I found both of them to be stale.

Verdict:

Harbour Sixty is not somewhere you would go often because otherwise, you'd have to mortgage your house.  The most expensive item on their menu (the Double Porterhouse, which is a double T-bone steak), rings in at $115.  They have a generous wine list, and a varied menu.  With tax and tip, our bill came to $80.

I definitely give them top marks for food and service.  Our water glasses were topped up at frequent intervals, the server was attentive and down-to-earth.  When we exited the elevator, we were even surprised to find that the waiter came downstairs to direct us back to the parking lot.  I would recommend Harbour Sixty for a milestone birthday, or family occasion but not for a romantic dinner.  It definitely lives up to its reputation for good food, and now, also for its stellar service!"}
{"text":"Excellent steaks! Rented the private dining room for a group reservation. Food was excellent but room was noisy and at the end the orders all got mixed up and wait staff was bringing either wrong items or serving them to the wrong guests. I believe the food is great but the service could be better."}
{"text":"My dad took me to this steakhouse for my birthday. It was one of the best meals I have ever eaten, thought it was pretty expensive. I am a big fan of seafood, seafood tower and lobster chowder was a hit. For the main course, I got the porterhouse steak and a side of lobster mashed potatoes. And my dad ordered filet mignon. It was all very delicious, but 250$ later. I wish it a bit cheaper, so I could come here more often.

Thank for great meal!"}
{"text":"Definitely an expense account kind of place.
Service was very good, the wine list was extensive (and can get expensive), steaks were great and cooked as requested. The desert I had, coconut cream pie, was top notch. A bit of a strange set up where you need to take an elevator to the restroom.
As long as it is not coming out of my wallet I would be happy to return, Still prefer Jacobs though."}
{"text":"My husband took me for my birthday based on the good reviews online and from colleges.  We arrived at 6:00pm.  The restaurant was dead.  We were the first people in.  

Food:
1)Charred Beef Carpaccio - It was different, but nothing wow.  
2) Caesar salad was delicious.  
3) We shared the Roasted Prime Rib (22oz) and ordered a generous portion of Asparagus as a side.  The asparagus was made to perfection with the right mix of garlic (lemony) zest.  The Prime Rib was disappointing.  It was bland and tasted like card board.  Our cut was super lean and therefore it was not juicy nor tender.  It was very hard to eat (taste and texture wise) let alone finish.  We ending wasting 1/3 of it.  Mind you, my husband does not like to waste food and he didn't want to finish off the steak because it was that awful.

Before we ordered our waiter made recommendation on the Kobe beef, it was priced at \"market price\" which was super expensive (can't remember the price, which was fine for top notch) and insisted the larger cut to share was the only way to go.  We knew that the large cut was too much because we also wanted appetizers.  We decided to go with our gut.  A few minutes later we over heard another waiter tell a couple seated next to us that the smaller cut was more than sufficient.  Thank goodness we never ordered the Kobe, after tasting the Prime Rib it was money wasted.  Our waiter then continued to ask us if we wanted coffee/dessert, even though we said no twice.  He then returned a third time with the dessert menu saying \" I'm going to mean about this *smirk* and show you the dessert menu anyway...maybe for next time\".  We had already asked for the bill.... 

This was NOT the award-winning quality steak we heard about or was looking forward to.  We also found the decor very dated.  We left the restaurant at 7:30 and there were only two other tables since we first arrived."}
{"text":"Bad service and overpriced mediocre food. Save your time and money and go to Jacob's or Barberian's instead"}
{"text":"This was my second time here for my friends birthday! We were a small group of 6.  Upon arrival we were greeted by 4 hostesses at the front. They walk you through the restaurant to your table. Perhaps for the experience as there is a secondary door to seating. 3/6 arrived and they brought out a lovely plate of bread and olives feta/goat cheese, hot peppers and something I else that tasted like horseradish and Asiago maybe? It tasted good. I ordered the 22oz prime rib. Also ordered was the chicken, burger filet minion and bone in steak. We all tastes each other's main course, I would say that the bone in steak was the best. The prime rib was cooked to med but the cut was too thick. I would have preferred a thinner bigger cut but so be it. You have to buy your sides for the steaks in addition so I shared the lobster mash potatoes.  The server was excellent! They definitely are very attentive to the table.  Note - halfway through our service what I assume was a guy who specializes in wine came to our table; he wanted to recommend wine to us but those already drinking had already ordered so it was somewhat irrelevant.  The ambiance is great, comfortable chairs, mood lighting to boot. Overall a great experience but i have to do the comparison to the keg....  I did enjoy the food and it's nice to go somewhere more \"classy\" on occasion, but was the price justifiable? That's for you to decide. Each couple spent over $200."}
{"text":"Nice ambience. Great place to impress. Service is top notch.   If you want Ambience and atmosphere that screams opulence and old world charm. This is it.

The food was mediocre.  The steaks are corn fed. They are descent.  The sides are mediocre. 

The fish selection is descent.  

Overall this place is overpriced but it's a cool spot.  If you are looking to spend 300 on a steak date. And really enjoy your steak ...  Go to Jacobs.   If you want to spend money on seafood go to Chase"}
{"text":"Had dinner here in the private room with a group of friends. 

The complimentary bread was very fresh and fruity. We couldn't help munching on them. 

We ordered lots of appetizers to share. They all were good but nothing exceptional. 

The service was attentive and is expected from a fine dining restaurant. My only problem was the size of most steaks on the menu is very large. Our waiter didn't suggest that the steak could be shared by two people. Instead he said to us: do not look at the size of the steak. Just think about which cut you like. We ordered a few sides too per his suggestion. In the end, we were all stuffed and had to pack the left over steak home."}
{"text":"Having finished our morning business meeting, the decision for where to grab lunch was next on our agenda. My American colleagues and I all had flights departing late afternoon, and we were told that the fare at the airport was less than stellar. I've flown out of Toronto twice over the past 10 months and I had to agree; nothing stood out in my mind. Our Canadian friends recommended we try Harbor 60 - right across the street from their office. \"It's an upscale place, but if you let them know you're in a rush, they'll accommodate you.\" Well, OK then, decision made!

Upon entry we were taken by the old school charm. Inside the door near the hostess stand they have several bottles of very aged wine and liqueurs on display in a locked glass cabinet. Our hostess took our coats and hung the in a wardrobe closet close by. We could immediately sense that this is certainly upscale and I already found myself wishing we didn't have to rush. But, alas, we had 45 minutes, and our server said he would gladly see that we made that - and he did.

The lunch menu offered a nice variety of fare, and my eyes went straight to the fish & chips. \"Of course,\" said our server, \"it's Friday.\" That had nothing to do with my choice but I just said, \"indeed, it is!\" That seemed to please him. Anyway, one colleague ordered the cheeseburger and the other the prime rib sandwich with au jus. We munched on the variety of fresh breads delivered to our table as the kitchen accommodated us by getting the food out quickly enough so we could actually enjoy it before making our escape within the hour.

I really hate that we had to rush this, as the atmosphere is chic, the service outstanding, the wine list looked superb, and our lunches were delicious. This is a place in which to relax and enjoy the experience. We enjoyed our experience for sure, but I would have preferred to savor it. I will seek this out for dinner next time I visit Toronto. And I don't plan to rush. Very nice, indeed, and it's Friday!"}
{"text":"***LISTEN UP all yaSTEAK lovers!!! You will be in tears after feasting at Harbour Sixty. This is a very classy atmosphere with valet parking. Upscale restaurant.

I am very picky with my steak, not many places can prepare it to my liking. I like my steak medium rare to rare. Harbour Sixty definitely met my standard and expecting, it had pleased my taste buds. 

Food quality is GREAT, it is DELISH!!!!!!!! Portion is very generous!! Ladies, you will definitely want to split it with someone. Its worth your trip!!! TOTALLY WORTH!!!

The pancetta wrapped sea scallops was declious, this is an appertizer so the portion is just enough for oneself if you love your scallops.

Porterhouse steak is an excellent choice for us. Likesaid, the portion is really generous but delicious...Mmmmm....just the thought of it makes me want to go back NOW ;)

I love the way the sides were prepared, the fresh asparagus, sauteed rapini and sauteed button mushrooms. My personal favourite out of these 3 sides is the sauteed rapini. Love it, they had added horseradish and chilli pepper to spice it up a nudge.

Be sure to save some room for dessert, coz it is a good serving too, Lemon tart and souffle gave us a great finishing touch.

 I'LL BE BACK Harbour Sixty!!!"}
{"text":"Steak was charred burnt and bitter. It was also extremely salty. The ambiance was nice though just the steaks were disappointing."}

I was a regular patron when I was working in Toronto 13 years ago and, when business took me back to the city this week,  I couldn't wait to visit the restaurant again. I am pleased to report it's still wonderful. Everything about the meal and experience is exceptional."}
{"text":"Haven't been there in a while and for good reason. I took my son there last week and what was a pretty good meal was spoiled with the $56 glass of wine. I simply asked for a glass of red with my main. When I got home I looked over the bill and \"wow\": They charged me $56 for a glass of wine. I have paid more for wine in the past but chose to do so during a special occasion. Asking for a glass of wine during a casual dinner with your 11 year old son and getting a $56 glass is not the right thing to do. They have offered to treat me next time I am in but that is not the point. It's just deceitful."}
{"text":"Delicious and beautiful!
Top notch food quality, service and decor!
Surprised with free valet! And extremely gorgeous and cozy heated patio with a huge fire place, fresh flowers, comfortable and classy decor!

Yes it's very expensive, but worth every penny!

Check out the seafood tower! It's amazing!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed my experience.  We sat in the downstairs private room like atmosphere after a drink at the lively bar.  The vaulted ceilings and dark wood gave the perfect private dining club feel.  I took a 4 clients to dinner their and having been there before recommended the Ahi Tuna appetizer which being a Tuna fan is one of my favorites because of the sweet savory combo of the appropriately peppered edge paired with the pineapple.  I had to get the bone in filet which you do have to ask for since is not on the menu.  It was cooked to perfection and so was the Pacetta-wrapped sea scollops which I ordered for the table.  This is one of the more impressive wine lists in Toronto if you or who you are taking out are into that.  
I will certainly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking to spend a good amount of money for a great steak."}
{"text":"I enjoyed dining here.   Having passed by it so many times while taking the GO bus to work/school, I had the impression that based on its location and reputation that it would be a pretentious place.  I was pleasantly surprised that the wait staff were unpretentious and super friendly.  As well, they were playing snoop dogg and old school hip-hop and r&b at the lounge area.  The pricing is equivalent to that of a high end steakhouse.  Had the filet mignon which was buttery as it should be.  The lobster mashed potatoes (had real lobster chunks in it) was so falvourul, along with the truffled mac and cheese.  The Caesar salad was okay, but that is because I found it to be too mild, as I prefer my Ceasar salad to be super garlicky.  This is a good place to bring your loved one for a date or to impress a business client."}
{"text":"Harbour Sixty has the best steaks/seafood I have ever had. The catch of the day is always fresh/perfect! the steaks are made just the way you like it, and there is a huge selection. I Love the sides that you can choose, it has some unique choices and every one of them is delicious. there is nothing to complain about this place, this is my number one choice whenever I'm downtown.

and best of all, is the desserts!!! the souffle, creme brulee, and my favorite the baked Alaska to share. 

5 stars+"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Harbour 60 and it was incredible. Our server was Fred L and we were table 39. I have never had such fabulous service in my life. We have been to several 5 star restaurants including Ruth Crist's and this is the best in the city."}
{"text":"Awesome experience, it certainly costs a good deal of money but it was well worth it.  Next time we are in Toronto we will return."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday and boy was it expensive. The steaks were huge, if you go with two people you should probably share because you won't be able to finish one yourself. The steak was the size of my head- when a steak is that big it looses its flavour, you get sick of eating it. I would recommend coming here for the baked Alaska. The view and service was great."}
{"text":"Great place, had one of the best NY strip steaks with broccolini and Mac & Cheese - although the steak while I ordered it medium rare was rare inside. Five stars if I disregard some loud drunk guys in the table behind. Waitresses very fast and nice. Minus two stars for over pricing vodka soda at $24 per glass - this makes the place really pricy."}
{"text":"Great service, excellent cheese cake, however bone-in ribeye was just ok.  Good sized cooked medium but there was no sizzle and the steak was not hot."}
{"text":"Was able to enjoy a nice dinner on the company a few weeks back.

I came in with high expectations and left completely satisfied. Had I have been the one left to pay the bill, my attitude may have changed. But since I was not, the $52 long bone lamb chops got top marks! Perfectly cooked, with a tasty potato pancake/latke-like accompaniment. Throw in a side of the fresh asparagus and the Truffled Mac & Cheese (hands down the best mac and cheese I've ever had), round out with Banana Crepe for dessert, and you've got a winner.

The service was on point, including even being willing to find a phone charger and charge someones cell phone while we ate. 
At the end of the day, while I'm not sure if I'll ever pony up the cash myself for a $50+ steak, if the company offers again, I'll certainly be up to the task."}
{"text":"Best lamb chops in all of Toronto! Not to mention the cocktails and port are always great. Service is very good as expected in a place like this. Though the steak is never up to par the rest of the menu is very good"}
{"text":"Harbour is the self-proclaimed better steak house of the area and it shows with a touch of healthy arrogance and the food to back it up.  

I had veal osso bucco was super tender, slow cooked to an almost pork roast texture, with delightful bone marrow available inside.  My friend had a bone in rib eye that was one large beauty to behold.  

The waitresses, bartenders and hostesses were all quite beautiful (and perhaps buxom).  

The steaks come sans sides save for a few featured dishes.  The wine is where the prices I thought were unreasonable, around $20 a glass+.  

The bar area looked a bit more happening and I probably may come back for that bacon app and a drink Christine mentions below."}
{"text":"This is a second to the best steakhouse. You can't really give a five star until you have been to all of the following steakhouses which are (Jacob&co, Michael's on Simcoe, Barbarian).
I have been to Jacob&co and Michael's on Simcoe, haven't been to barbarian yet. However I could conclude that in order to distinguish the finest steakhouse of yours, there's no ranking, ranking will be different for everyone, the only way to distinguish is to visit all of them, and by visiting all of them I don't mean by going there once, but also try all types of different steaks such as rib eye, tenderloin, new york strip and porterhouse from all these restaurant, then you can conclude the finest steakhouse out of all these four restaurants, there's only one, the one that you like the most or the one that give you the best memory with the one you love."}
{"text":"Service gets 5 stars, Food gets 4 stars. Me and the boyfriend came on a Tuesday and had a nice intimate dinner. They let us sit where we wanted to. This place was not that crowded and the parking was ample. Like I said the service was A-1. The server checked on us constantly. The food left for more to be desired, but I was more into the ambience and the vibe of the place. This was probably one of the better places in the city, and beats STK by far in terms of class and service."}
{"text":"A posh steakhouse sitting in an old building. Unlike other traditional steak houses where you would imagine it's a place for the old boys' club, Harbour Sixty is an upscale trendy restaurant with extremely courteous staff crew. 

Let me just start with the wine selection. Once they sit you down, you get two books. Yes, I mean books. The first one which is one inch thick is there wine selection. Whilst it is slightly on the pricey side, it definitely covers an extremely wide varietals from each country and region. 

The second book is their menu. Their selection and cut are also that extensive that you can order off the menu. If you are interested in learning about the cuts, your server can always bring you to their counter and show you those cuts. 

The quality of meat is top notch and finished was spot on. I ordered mushrooms on the side and it came in a Staub container where the mushrooms were piping hot! 

Go try this steakhouse out! You wont regret!"}
{"text":"I give it 2-Stars simply because of the pricing. I thoroughly enjoyed the evening. The steak was out of this world and one of the only restaurants in Canada that serves USDA Prime (above AAA).

The wine list is out of control. I think its excessively vast and the markup is in the 300% range, higher than even Scaramouche or Splendido. It was difficult to find any value on this menu.

On the positive side, the 'Vesper' martini is one of the best I've ever had and the service was very good. For my money, try Scaramouche (the Filet there is even better!)"}
{"text":"Let's get the obvious out of the way, it is absurdly expensive. Not expensive .... EXPENSIVE. Sort of make up a number expensive. Two steaks, one app, two glasses of wine, two drinks and one dessert hit us $360 including tax and tip. If you've read my other reviews you know there must be a catch, and ther eis, we had a considerable gift card for our 10th wedding anniversary so this meal set us back the equivalent of a visit to Cora's.

Now in saying all that, i will say that i do far prefer an expensive steak house to an expensive fine dining establishment. From what I saw here the food was not too creative and the portions were good enough to avoid a side trip to McDonalds on the way home (looking at you Buca). 

We chose to sit on the patio which was a mistake, music was too loud and the highway is right there. Ambiance was \"well dressed but not pretentious\" though if you're not driving a German SUV or Italian Coupe, your car is going to look out of sorts in the valet area. No idea what it wa slike in the dining room though, I would certainly recommend a jacket for the gents. Ladies just turn up half naked and you'll fit right in. 

Steaks were bang on, my rib steak was a little too heavily marbled for my taste but others may disagree. It was gluttonous, delicious and weighed more than my own head. Have been to Gibby's and Cote de Chevalle in Montreal and to be frank i think Harbour 60 makes the best steak. 

App was solid, as was dessert and sides but the mains are the stars here. 

Service was attentive but not overbearing, did an outstanding job of explaining the menu and offering guidance on portion size. 

If you have a major milestone coming up, maybe forgo gifts and treat yourself, it's probably worth it."}
{"text":"Steak is awesome ^^  At harbour sixty the steak is SO good. The sides are not to be ignored either. Parmesan fries and lobster mash are addictive. Don't skip on dessert! They have seating by the kitchen which is a neat experience watching your meal being prepared. There's also a bar lounge area plus private party rooms. Definitely worth checking out~"}
{"text":"Met up with my boy for a classic guys' dinner and had a fantastic experience.  We were seated at the patio (which is a must) and had two extremely attractive servers (one who was in training) who were both very friendly and down-to-earth.  They had a DJ pumping great tracks in the background and the food was fantastic.  It was *exactly* what we wanted.

We had the seafood sampler for 1 and it was humongous.  Fish tacos were pretty tasty and the short rib appetizer which I had as my main was utterly sumptuous.  I'm a huge fan of the steak at Jacob but I would pick Harbour Sixty for the overall experience."}
{"text":"Food Is great, Service is great, Portions are HUGE.

Must try coconut cream pie and the molten chocolate lava cake... but share, like everything else, its fairly oversized. 

While I'm fine with paying the price for good eats, sometime of their over-pricing is a little laughable.

You dont leave hungry, but your wallet leaves empty."}
{"text":"The food and service here was great. I was looking to visit sometime, but never had the opportunity till now.

We were seated quickly and I was lucky to make a same day reservation for two people. Everybody was very polite and greeted you as you came in. We came here for steak and steak is what we had alongside of two sides. 

They prepared the steaks well and the server gave us a brief explanation about their cuts and their preparation methods. He was very patient in explaining the differences as well as our need for copious amounts of bread. I derped and accidentally set the cloth used to hold the bread on fire because I set it too close to the candle on the table and they quickly whisked away the flaming bread basket away. The server who alerted me was carrying a 3 story ensemble of glasses and plates and he didn't even drop or spill a single one when he saw the bonfire. 2pro.

The steaks were done well and they were juicy inside and crispy on the outside. I would come back again, but only after I've tried out all the top steakhouses in Toronto. The sides, we had a brussel sprout salad and fries. I don't know why I chose fries actually. And they weren't any different from fries in other restaurants. Whatever, had fries anyways. The salad was alright, but I'm not a fan of salad anyways. 

Service: 5/5
Food: 4/5
Price Point: 4/5

Food was great, but I think the sides could've been better."}
{"text":"I went here for my friend's 30th birthday dinner and just thinking about yesterday's dinner upsets me still. 

The food was terrible. Absolutely, undeniably, terrible. I would not have expected such an establishment to serve such mediocre food. I read a few negative yelp reviews but they were far and in between. I was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. 

Those that praise this place's food, I am speechless. 

The pricing is RIDICULOUS. I love fine dining. I can, and am willing, to spend hundreds on meals as long as the price warrants the experience. 

This place, does not.

We were a group of 15 and we booked the Louis XIII Room. Also known as the famous \"room that Drake filmed his music video in\". Every single person of the 15 left unsatisfied and upset.

We pulled up to valet and went through the front doors to be greeted by... Noone. We waited and decided to walk through. Waiters zoomed by us without a greeting. We were confused. The ceilings were really really low. There were no windows. We felt like we were in a cruise ship, trapped. Finally we were able to find the hostess stand tucked away somewhere. 

We decided to get a drink at the bar. The cocktails ranged from $26 to $45 - These were more expensive than cocktails at Dbar at Four Seasons. The bar was a standard bar, that looked pretty much like what I had in the basement of my house, not a fancy well-stocked bar. Surprising that the bar would be this lacking and so, ordinary, for such an establishment.

We finished our cocktails (at least the were strong to numb the pain of terrible overpriced food) and as we were about to get up from our seats a waitress with a flaming baked Alaska yelled \"BEHIND YOU WATCH OUT\" as she ran past us. I feel like she could've waited and let us pass first, not like we are at a marketplace. Rude.

We made our way back down the nondescript stairs to the low-ceiling area i.e. basement where the Louis XIII Room turned out to be as well. It was a cramped room with a wooden table that was much too large for the size of the room. The chandeliers were modern in a tacky way. There were about thirty champagne flutes lined up on the far side of the wall and another thirty glasses behind me. I felt like I was in a random storage room of the restaurant. The glasses were there in the beginning, were unused, and left there for the whole night. 

Service was mediocre. We had only one waitress to serve all of us for the entire evening. 

I asked pricing for the market price items: Beluga Caviar was ($245) and the Kobe Beef Steak  was ($450). We traveled to Tokyo and had mouth watering Kobe Beef steak. We decided not to take the risk here.

Alcohol:
We ordered ordinary shots of Hennessy for the birthday girl. The were $40 each. The cheapest half bottle of red was $36 with the 2nd cheapest being $50 - some Tuscan Sangiovese blend. It was great because they didn't cook it! 

Appetizers:
Crab cakes ($22) to share for two, they plated it separately so we can each have one crab cake(!).   I asked them to go easy on the salt (based on Yelp reviews). They still came out salty. 

Ahi Tuna Tartare ($25) very bland. Not seasoned all the way through. Raw tuna was very chunky. Generous portion though.

Watermelon Salad - This salad made the whole table laugh. It was watermelon sprinkled with feta cheese (the same feta cheese left out on the table to eat with the bread). 

Mains:
Prime Rib ($52),  medium rare. The cut had so much cartilage my fingers were starting to spasm and hurt from trying to saw my way through the cartilage. The meat was bland. I couldn't swallow the pieces of cartilage - I left most of it untouched.

Bone in Rib Steak ($52). It was cut too thick and was overly charred on the outside that it gave a bitter aftertaste. Also left most of it untouched.

Sides:
Asparagus (half, $6.50). Tasted very ordinary 
Lobster Mashed Potatoes ($15) - tiny piece of lobster on top of mashed potatoes, the potatoes tasted like the mashed potato mix you can get at the supermarket
Roasted Cauliflower - This was probably the only dish that was gourmet. Had a strong taste of curry and was charred well. Over seasoned but memorable.

Sauce:
Foie Gras and Truffle au Jus ($3) - What an odd tasting sauce. It was kind of tangy and sweet with a strong molasses type flavour but maybe burnt? Not recommended. First, the lady set it down for the guest to the left of me so I told her it was mine. She looked at me, POINTED at the guest to my left and said \"NO ITS HIS\" then came back and said \"ITS ACTUALLY YOURS\".  I thought pointing was rude?

Dessert:
I don't remember, the food was so terrible I just drank more wine to numb myself so I can go home and lament over my $400 I just burn to a crisp.

Please, for the love of God, do not eat here. Go to Jacob's Steakhouse for your money or even The Keg.

Oh, one good thing - they have really nice toilets with bidets."}
{"text":"Came for a buddy's birthday. 

Heres what we ordered for the evening:
Two bottles of chianti. 
Seared Foie gras and Halibut ceviche for starters.
Comes with complementary bread spread (cheese olives butter). 
For mains we ordered the Bone-in Ribeye, Prime rib, and a New York Strip. 
Sides: Lobster Mash, Truffle Mac and Cheese (shell pasta), and truffle fries.
Flat water

Service was very attentive. 
Ambience was dim and relaxed. 

Takeaway:
Well ventilated dining room but seats are too snug for personal preference. Food was above average in quality but poorly executed. Prime rib was overcooked and granted they do check..I'd have expected it done correctly the first time. NY strip resembled an overcooked filet mignon and pacing of food could have been improved. 

Do not get the truffle fries in spite of their insistence. Generally enjoyed myself because of my company. There's an air of misguided conceit that comes with the experience my group had. I wouldn't come back.. but I know one of my friends would."}
{"text":"By far the best steakhouse I've been to in Toronto.  
The ambiance is elegant & beautiful, the presentation Is well done and the food is exceptional. The steak is heavenly! 

For desert I recommend the marshmallows & chocolate .. it comes with a cute little fire on your plate to roast your marshmallows on."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Harbour Sixty to celebrate my fiance's birthday. Service was excellent - our server was very attentive and friendly. He was very knowledgeable about the menu items.

* BLACK TRUFFLE STEAK & EGGS (5/5)
(10 oz Prime Tenderloin Topped with a Free Range Fried Duck Egg 'Sunny Side Up' & Shaved Black Truffles, White Truffle Oil)
5 stars!! Loved this so much - I ordered medium rare steak. They loaded the top with lots of truffle shavings and the truffle oil flavour was very strong. Highly recommending this, it was so delicious.

* BONE-IN RIB STEAK (4/5)
My fiance ordered this and thought the portion was perfect - which means it would be too much for me haha. He ordered this in medium rare too - the meat was nice and tender!

SIDES:
* BRUSSELS SPROUTS (5/5)
(Soy Ginger Glaze, Sesame, Garlic)
Since we were consuming all meat, we thought it would be nice to pair it with brussels sprouts. Best decision. This was so yummy - the taste doesn't get bland at all! 

* LOBSTER MASHED POTATO (4/5)
This is very delicious but very filling! There are huge lobster chunks in the mashed potato - which tasted very fresh.I think one side dish was enough for us - we ended up packing this."}
{"text":"Best dinner I've had to date...

I know this is frowned upon, but I ordered a well-done new york strip.  The waiter recommended having it butterflied and it turned out perfectly.  Still melted in my mouth and still had that juicy, beautifully grilled flavor.

Excellent service and ambiance, not too quiet or too loud... (granted we visited late on a weeknight back in May of 2013).

My friend (who has a more qualified palate) had the prime rib and also delighted in the flavor, presentation, and service."}
{"text":"Gosh I love this place.  Totally worth the money.  The building itself has a lot of history, and the name Harbour Sixty comes from the fact that the water used to come all the way up to Harbour St.  

I love the beautiful, traditional decor.  I came here for a special event, and was taken down the elevator to one of the event rooms.  I felt like I was travelling back in time to a secret speakeasy or something.

The event space was great.  There were about 40 us of, comfortably seated with a screen for the presentation.  

I had the caesar salad, rib eye and coconut cream pie.  Everything tasted like a little piece of heaven.  The coconut cream pie was one of the best I've ever had and want to come back just for dessert (but would stuff my face with pretty much anything they make!)."}
{"text":"Great service, great food.  those shrimp are HUGE.  The steak I had was superb.  The creme brule could have used some work but overall I was delighted by the experience at Harbour Sixty.

Highly recommended.  Everything is fresh.  Definitely not for those on a budget.  Save up your money and go one time!"}
{"text":"Old school steakhouse with impeccable service, great ambiance and a gorgeous bar. One of the best restaurants in Toronto IMHO.  Clearly where the financial services industry movers and shakers meet to dine and do deals.

I met business guests here for lunch.  It's an ideal place for business meetings - in fact that's probably what it is designed for.

Had the seafood salad for lunch - not quite what I expected (I thought there was going to be a lot more green in the salad) but lots and lots of seafood so who am I to complain?  Point of fact it was excellent.  Accompanying this was a nice glass of pinot grigio.  

Overall an exceptional dining experience."}
{"text":"I was out with an employee and we had a great server.  I think that is their way.

We went a little overboard with ordering; oysters, and various cold serve, Caesar salads, and generous steaks.

Overall it is reminiscent of a US style Chicago steakhouse with cooked to perfection charbroiled steaks.  You need to order your temp as if you were in the USA so keep that in mind if you are looking to Canadian standards.

It is certainly pricey but worth it for a great steakhouse experience.  Crowed is very c-suite or at least Bay Street but overall a welcoming place.  An excellent and rare scotch / whiskey selection but again pricey.  We certainly enjoys ourselves but left $300 a head light.  You could probably get away with $120 a head but once you read the menu that may be difficult.

If you are wanting to open your wallet and have an excellent and delicious meal go here.  If you care a lot about your money than you may think it is too much.  But again if you go to A Chicago steakhouse this is only expected but you are in TO."}
{"text":"Harbour 60 is the rare steakhouse (pun intended) where the steep prices match the quality of steak and seafood on offer. It's a special occasion type of place, unless you are a Toronto Maple Leaf, who will undoubtedly be seated at the table next to you at dinner. 

Our business dinner started with a seafood tower piled high with an aquarium of over-sized crab, lobster, fish and other down-under delights. Then we shared a medley of pre-sliced steaks and sides cooked exactly to our liking. I don't entirely remember a dessert because we were many bottles into the Red by this time, but I imagine it measured up to the other courses.

Did I mention this is all served up by supermodels and sommeliers? Too bad the restaurant didn't hire Tom Hardy lookalikes for the female customers. There's clearly room for improvement there."}
{"text":"It was very delicious! And the staff was very friendly and pleasant! The bathrooms are super cool"}
{"text":"Terrible. My bf and I came here after reading great reviews online. For our appetizers, we ordered Calamari and Ahi Tuna Tartar. For our mains, we both ordered Filet Mignon with Mashed Potatoes and Broccolini on the side to share. We were expecting high quality food based on the reviews and the price for everything we ordered, but we were in for a surprise.

After placing our orders, the waiter came back in less than 5 minutes with the Calamari. We were surprised at how fast it came out because usually it should take at least 15 minutes to freshly prepare a new batch, especially at a high-end restaurant. The calamari wasn't hot, fresh or crispy. The texture was more on the soggy side, as if the calamari was sitting out and just reheated. Definitely a bad start to our meal. The Ahi Tuna Tartar was another terrible dish, worse than the calamari for sure. The Ahi Tuna was warm and the flavours of the sauce were just bad. 

Now for the Filet Mignon, we both ordered our steaks medium rare and the outer edges were fine but the center of the steak was too raw for us, and the outside crust of the steak was really dry and overcooked. One thing I noticed when eating my steak was that I tasted a lot of curry flavour. I'm not sure if the steak was meant to have a curry taste, but I definitely tasted it and it wasn't pleasant at all. No steak should be served with curry flavour unless it was stated directly on the menu.

We had a terrible dining experience at Harbour Sixty and we couldn't understand how this restaurant received many great reviews. Either the chef on duty was severely slacking that day or that this is the norm for the restaurant. We've been to several high-end restaurants and never have we experienced such distasteful food, especially the extra added curry flavour on the steak. It's extremely unbelievable at how much money we spent on poor quality food. I don't recommend this restaurant to anybody considering it because there are tons of steakhouses, such as Jacobs & Co Steakhouse, that offer top quality food at almost the same price."}
{"text":"Pricey but a great experience !

The atmosphere is fine dinning with low light in the rooms. They have several different styles of dinning room areas but each is just as classy and vintage as the others. 

The cellar is stunning and the decor all around is beautiful. 

They have valet parking on hand. 

Now to the food. 
We choose a selection of appetizers along with a plate of the carpaccio which were tasty. 
For my entree I choose the steak. 
It was a bit over cooked to my liking and really dark on the outside however it was still tasty. 
They lacked in presentation on this plate even though that was the only thing on it, they could of added some colour or garnish that would of made it more appealing (first pic). 
I ordered brussels sprouts (which looked charred and not appetizing) and mashed potatoes on the side. Again the presentation wasn't there on these plates but the mashed potatoes were still edible, unlike the brussels sprouts they were clearly over cooked as the green lacked a vibrant green hue. 

In the end we ordered the frozen baked Alaskan. Now that's a presentation on it's own!! And delicious!! Definitely a sharing plate. 

This dessert and the setting was worth it. As for the steak and other food...well I think I will choose another place for that. 

Staff was wonderful, friendly and attentive. 

I will definitely be back for dessert even though this is a steakhouse ;)"}
{"text":"The food was great, but they tried to sit my boyfriend and I by the server station, which was strange cause the restaurant was nearly empty. Then they sat us in a part of the restaurant where all the lights were on. I don't want to eat in the dark, but some nice, dim lighting would go a long way. They did not even ask if we wanted to sit outside, which was the better part of the restaurant. I only saw the outside part on the way out through the back door. It was my birthday, and no one wished me a happy birthday. My boyfriend made it clear that it was my birthday before we arrived. 

Our server was in a rush to get us in and out. When we were seated at this table he came by to ask if we wanted water. He was so flustered we couldn't understand what he was saying. It took him forever to take our order, and we had to ask him what the specials were. Then he brings us bread with a few spreads, and did not even explain what everything was. When we needed something he was no where to be found, and had to ask the other servers to assist us. 

The location of this place is terrible. We stayed down the street, and couldn't get a cab cause it was so close. I was in heels, as it was my 30th bday, so walking was my 2nd choice. We decided to walk, and I had to walk in rocks and through construction in stilettos.      

the food is literally the only good thing about this place, and it wasn't even all that. I had a lower quality bday experience for coming here. Never again!"}
{"text":"Called Harbour sixty to make a reservation for a large group (~20 people).  They referred me to their events manager who was not in when I called at 11 AM but they assured me she would call me back when she got in.  By 6 PM I had not received a call so I called them back and lo and behold, she was gone for the day.  They assured me she would call me back once again.  Next day, same exact story.  In the end, we went to Hy's Steakhouse which was incredible.  Because of their unprofessional behavior, I'm happy to say Harbour sixty missed out on ~$4000 which we spent at Hy's instead.  Will not even try to go here again due to their lack of professionalism."}
{"text":"Rib Eye steak was fantastic but a little over cooked. 

Service was exceptional , but waiter farted and tried to cover it up with a cough.

Stinky but satisfied."}
{"text":"Super expensive, but very delicious food and superb service. We sat \"bar side\" at a table for 4 in an intimate little corner with extremely low lighting, such low lighting we needed cell phone flashlights to look at the wine list and menu. I LOVED the fried cauliflower in buffalo sauce. Typical steakhouse sides and options, nothing surprisingly exciting, but very well seasoned, prepared, and plated. The Sommelier was friendly and suggested a great alternative to the bottle we had ordered which they were out of. The hostesses were very kind and courteous. It was a pleasant experience, nice ambiance, inside a beautiful old building, newly renovated inside with chic decor. I'm also in love with their toilets, no lie, you've got to use the washroom whilst there!"}
{"text":"Rarely do I like to spend a lot of money for dinner, but my daughter and her new boyfriend were visiting me at my downtown Toronto condo a couple of weeks ago, and we wanted to eat somewhere special. Joining us were my daughter's boyfriend's friend, and another couple. When I called Harbour Sixty to make a reservation, they were full, but offered us one of the private rooms for our party of six - what a generous offer. So we walked over to the restaurant and were taken to the private room - a gorgeously wooded room lined with expensive bottles of wine and liquor. The waiter made us feel like celebrities, as we ordered appetizers including the grilled calamari and an amazing salad, as well as a plate of olives and feta cheese. For dinner, I had the trout, and my daughter and her boyfriend had the lobster and steak. Everything was delicious and the service was superb. The restrooms are also state of the art - with heated toilet seats that open and close on their own, and also are self-cleaning. Overall, an amazing meal and night to remember. The total bill for 5 was over $600, with wine and beer. OK, it was an exorbitant night for a meal and we won't do it likely again for a long while, but an amazing night to remember."}
{"text":"This was a disappointing experience. The food is alright and not worth the price you pay. That being said, what really turned us off this place is the service. I booked this restaurant months in advance and had to wait 40 minutes to be seated. No apology given. When we did get seated, we were placed right next to the kitchen, which was frankly just an unpleasant and distracting spot. We felt like an afterthought. We repeatedly asked to be moved to a booth and they repeatedly forgot to do so until I politely reminded what must have been a 5th time. By then we were on dessert. Thanks for that. 

I know people reading this are going to find this kind of criticism petty, and I accept that, but this was our final anniversary dinner before getting married. It was supposed to be special, and I made that fact known when I secured the reservation. I'm a patient and understanding guy but this was just so contrary to my expectations in terms of food and service quality. Basically soured the entire evening. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Extremely expensive but as the saying goes, you do get what you pay for.  There's not a great selection of appetizers or even sides for your main course.   In fact, if you're looking for anything BUT steak, I'd just go someplace else, especially considering their prices.   But...you go to a steakhouse FOR steak... and this, is the King of Toronto steakhouses -- it's regal setting and sterling reputation are only outdone by its prices, which seem tailor made for the type of inclusive group you'd expect the royal family to be a part of.   But again, you get what you pay for.  The cuts of meat and selection are as good as it gets and every steak I've had there was cooked to perfection. Now, by \"every\" I do mean the ONE steak I had that ONE time I went there, but it was soooo good and perfectly done, it deserves the embellishment.   And if we're being totally honest, by \"ONE\" I actually mean \"TWO\" as I have been there twice, but \"one\" worked better for the joke I'm already regretting having made.  Anways...my Rib-eye came with the bone in and expertly trimmed around -- it honestly looked like a photo shoot for an advertisement.  So 10/10 on appearance without a doubt.  And it tasted just as good.  So doing the math, that's a full 20/20!  

Despite anyone's individual  experience there, I'd say you're basically guaranteed raw ingredients (i.e. beef) of the highest quality that would meat (ha!) the highest and most scrupulous of standards, that are then treated with the respect they deserve, a respect that is finally complimented with a precision and skill you would expect from a specialty restaurant with these prices.   In other words, they cook a mean-ass steak... and in still more 'other words', they understand what 'medium rare ' actually means -- a term that should go without saying in a steakhouse, but unfortunately, based on my experience, does not and is worth the mention.  

The decor is also very elegant and formal, which, although typical in fine dining, is not always the case in a steakhouse -- for better or worse. 

They also have an incredibly deep and impressive wine selection.  Every steakhouse should, especially for Reds.  But Harbor 60 goes well beyond this expectation, even to the point where it COULD upstage the steak if you let it and were that type of wine aficionado. 

So if you love steak and got quite a lot of cash burning a hole in your pocket, this is the steakhouse for you.  It also can make one hell of an impression on a date/guest, if you're into that sort of thing.  It's also a great one stop shop if you're not only hungry but have also  done something terrible and your 'redemption' requires a punishment directly correlated to your wallet... if you seem to find yourself in that very specific circumstance (i.e. visit #2)."}
{"text":"Best part of our dinner was the bread and tapenades. Rest was just okay, not worth the price. We have been to steakhouses and this one was just not up to par. Seems like they are living off a name versus actually caring about the food that is being brought out.

Service was poor. The server kept forgetting things like asking me four times in the span of a minute if I wanted still or sparkling water, and then when my glass was empty trying to fill it with still. My second cup of wine arrived near the end of my entree (useless) after we asked four times where it was. Our entrees took forever to come out and some of our dishes were cold (something must have happened in the kitchen). And for dessert they didn't have the one thing that our table wanted (coconut cream pie) when we saw many go by during our looong meal. Other tables (regulars?) seemed to get much more attention than ours - so this did not leave a good impression on my mother whose birthday we were celebrating.

When we arrived the place was very noisy but quieted down more near the end.

We will not go back. Too bad - we had come in with good expectations."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to celebrate his promotion, and this place was lauded to the skies so we were looking forward to the evening.  We fully expected to drop a lot of money and didn't care so long as it lived up to it's reputation.  Beautiful old building, and we were seated in the lounge which is a bit more contemporary than the dining room, which seemed old and stuffy (old school banquettes in velvet or whatever, entitled older crowd who eyed us suspiciously as we walked through during an after meal tour given by our great server, being that we are under the age of 65).  Anyway, the servers caught my eye as the ranks are full of young women in incredibly short skirts or tight leather pants, more a club vibe than fine dining.  But our server was wonderful, very attentive and helpful in her short leather skirt (the uniform, after all),  she made the experience better.  The meal: was ok, nicely presented.  Dessert was outstanding, molten chocolate cake and beignets were superb.  It was good not great and I might come back for an abbreviated version of this decadent meal in future, but truth be told we've had a better meal at Ruth's Chris.  Here is where the wheels fell off for me: at the table next to us was seated what I presume to be members of the owners family.  I say this because of the way they behaved.  Of particular offence was the middle aged cougar in skin tight leather pants and six inch heels, all glammed up, talking loudly about this guy and that guy and how much so and so loved the lobster and comes in every day blah blah blah.  She seems connected to the restaurant, might be the manager, who knows, and I assume she is family (I would not employ her otherwise) but I found her vulgar.  I don't care who you know nor where you source your lobsters etc.   If you want to have a family meal and name drop all night move to a private table, so you don't disturb respectable clientele who drop $400 on a single meal.  They came across as spoiled and I am not inclined to further their interests.  Truth be told this place feels like it is in the midst of an identity crisis, it can't decide what it wants to be, and that comes through so clearly."}

and top notch service Thanks to Fransico, bartender extraordinar; we loved the Rioja enjoyed with the elegantly savage smoked bacon bar snack-served in silver. We'll be back to the ever swanky Harbour Sixty, as this is our new
cocktail stop before venturing into the evening. Looking to impress? Look no further as this is the spot. Lucky Toronto."}
{"text":"A place to save for very special occasions, as there is a hefty bill that comes with dining at an establishment such as this one. Ordered a glass of wine, seafood tower, and steak. Although prompt, service was not very friendly. We ordered the Baked Alaska for dessert,  which had an amazing presentation,  and tasted just okay. I'd say skip the dessert. Food was top notch though!"}
{"text":"Positives first: Great atmosphere. Waiter Michael was awesome. Sea bass and scallops were great. Negatives: Even though there were many tables and we had a reservation we were given worst table in the place which seems to happen when eating with kids at a nice restaurant even though they order same food as adults. However most disappointing was the steak. Talked up as the best steakhouse yet my $67 filet was overcooked and dry. Very disappointing for a $400 bill and will prevent us from coming back. Too bad. Was great otherwise but just can't forgive a top notch steak house for blowing a $67 steak. That's just unforgivable."}
{"text":"Came here because a friend of mine ate here the week prior and was constantly raving about the truffle rib eye that he had. Decided to go with his recommendation and ordered the shaved truffle rib eye with sunny side up egg. It was alright, nothing amazing and I've had way better steaks back in Vancouver. Definitely a let down.

My group and I also ordered the seafood tower, which was really good and we also order a couple sides to share but nothing was worth mentioning. The best thing was the Moscow mules, I was hammering them back to back hahah. Customer service was pretty good except one server that delivers the food to the table. She kept mixing up the orders and gave me the wrong steak. When I asked her if this was the correct one, she suddenly caught major attitude and \"assured\" me it was right but in the end, it wasn't lol!"}

{"text":"I have eaten at Harbour Sixty 3 different times: once for lunch and twice for dinner. All have been during business trips and I had a pretty fat expenses accounts--this steakhouse is not for the faint of wallet. 

The service is superb and the steaks are fantastic. My lunch experience was a hosted gathering; I had about 20 IT guys from the top financial banks and organizations in Toronto there for a round table lunch. We did not have to choose our meals off a pre-fixed menu and I had the prime rib sandwich which as very tender. Everyone was very satisfied with their meals and the staff was great

Both dinners were with colleagues who had just closed big deals and they were celebrating. My timing could not have been better. First dinner visit I had the 10 oz. filet mignon and a ton of starters: the crab cakes rocked!.

The second visit I had the lobster--did not ask the price, but it was huge and tasty. I will say that the wine list is comprehensive but a bit too pricey--I live a little too close to Napa Valley to pay $100 for a mediocre wine. 

Other than that--Harbour Sixty was a lovely experience and I would will return."}
{"text":"This is so far the best steak house in Toronto. Great service too. I have been here several times and every time was excellent ."}
{"text":"Don't read the reviews that say it's too expensive. That's just what a restaurant like this is. Great wine list. Great ambiance. I'd recommend this for a business dinner or anything romantic. Classic steak house."}
{"text":"Food was awesome! Def get the truffle Mac and cheese. Be warned the portions are huge. BF got the steak and was in heaven. I tried one of the fish and it was also very good. Ordered the chocolate lava cake which was delicious! Def try this place! FYI for all you Drake fans...he filmed a video in their Louie the 14th room."}
{"text":"Habour is worth a try just because it's such an institution in the city. It's been around forever, it's a beautiful building, and you will in-fact be eating some of the best meat in the city. I take up no issue with Harbour at all. The meat is fantastic, the service is flawless, the restaurant is beautiful and they've successfully created an extremely elevated atmosphere. It's a very luxurious restaurant and I was not disappointed. A little pricey and I prefer the old-school Chicago-style steakhouse, but if you're buying - count me in."}
{"text":"Me and wife came here on a baseball trip from Michigan and we were recommended by a friend to come here. The ribeye was pretty good, little bit on the chewy side but still a great steak. The wife had the shrimp Caesar and she said it was really good also. The one item I thought was amazing was the buffalo cauliflower side dish. It was awesome and out of this world."}
{"text":"The Worst Evening ...Expensive overrated tasteless meal I have ever had.... If your going to charge these prices at least serve appetizing food... App oysters and Creme brûlée was the best part of the meal but I can get that anywhere... Don't call this a steak house when it isn't ...pan frying more like it... Try a Steak House"}
{"text":"I am writing regarding a tremendously awful experience that I, 2 colleagues, 2 clients and 3 special guests (2 professional athletes and their agent) had at this restaurant last night. We had a 6:30PM reservation and when we called prior to the reservation to let them know one additional guest would be joining, we were told by the staff that they could accommodate but that we would have to be done by 7:45PM. I was in shock at that comment since A) the restaurant is an expensive one and I'd expect you to understand guests would want to take their time to enjoy that expensive experience and B) that's just not an appropriate thing to say to a customer. I ignored the comment from the hostess for both reasons mentioned above and shook it off prior to arriving.

Fast forward to dinner; I'm sitting at our table and the server greets me with \"I'm sorry you have to leave so soon!\" to which I replied... \"What do you mean? We have nothing scheduled for after dinner\" he said \"we have another party coming in here at 8\" (i.e. You people need to leave). 

The next hour and 15 minutes were about as enjoyable as a well done steak. I could sense we were being rushed by our server and the bus boys from the first course to the third... wait a minute... from the first course to the second since we weren't even offered coffee or dessert but presented with the check instead! I've never experienced treatment like this at ANY restaurant, let alone at one as upscale as this one. The $1,500 bill was not too shabby, so it was not as if we were taking up valuable space and splitting 3 side orders. We bought expensive wine, appetizers, salads, steaks and sides (not to mention a $120 lobster special that should have only been a lobster tail one of the guests asked for... something I could write a separate post about) so to be treated like that and rushed out in that manner was absolutely uncalled for. 

The food was good - I can't complain too much about that; but the service was so embarrassing (for both the restaurant and myself to be treated that way in front of my clients) that it has completely overshadowed any bite of that meal. The lobster (which they incorrectly ordered on our behalf and charged us for), was not good. Not at all. It wasn't worth $25.... And yet we were charged $120. 

I spent $190 on each guest and it might as well have been McDonalds."}
{"text":"Amazing.  This place alone made me love Toronto.  Very cool vibe in the bar area, and the servers are extremely attentive.  Great pours of alcohol,  well cooked steaks, and a nice choice of appetizers.  I really don't think I've been to too many places better than this."}
{"text":"Was treated to a lovely meal at Harbour Sixty this week and I was in complete awe over the menu, the food and the service at this place. 

It was a complete sausage fest when we arrived, tables upon tables of mostly businessmen. This is probably just because it was the week leading up to Christmas and everyone was busy getting their holiday parties in.

The interior is kind of old school, reminds me more of a fine dining establishment in Oxford or Cambridge, UK - high vaulted ceilings, dark mahogany, carpeting and large leather chairs. They also had some nice tables with circular booth seatings. 

The service here was second to none, honestly. Our server was knowledgeable of the menu, attentive without being annoying, friendly and quite a comedian to boot. 

My eyes nearly popped out of my head when I spotted a lobster & mango parfait in the appetizers, two of my favourite things combined! An easy pick. I also tried the blackened cod for my main, which was a daily special. My date had a Greek village salad to start and the bone-in tenderloin steak as a main. We shared some mashed potatoes and asparagus sides.

The food was ridiculous!! and beautifully presented. I stuffed myself silly because it was too good not to finish. The parfait was heaping with big chunks of fresh lobster and my cod was cooked to perfection, flaky and tender.

The wine menu here is one of the most extensive ones I have seen (47 pages!) The maître d' was quick to help with recommendations once asking your general preferences and price range.

Truly a place to dine in style!"}
{"text":"It may just be personal preference, but this was not a great experience for me. In my opinion, the food was offensively expensive, even relative to other high-end steakhouses. The service was good.  Maybe this place would best be described as one for the price inelastic. 

The building is gorgeous. We stopped by for oysters and a drink as it was close to our hotel. The oysters were $6 a piece, which was the most I've ever seen.  The cocktails averaged $25 to $30, which is the most I've ever seen for a non-cocktail driven bar.  We wanted to grab a bar bite, but the appetizer steak tartare was $40, so we took a pass. I get that nice places are more expensive, but the quality needs to far exceed that of other, lower-priced restaurants, and this was to the point that it made my partner uncomfortable to order things. The oysters were quite good.  We ordered a side of cauliflower, which was solid at $16. The complementary starting bread and spreads were the highlight and very delicious. If this was 50% less expensive, I would give it 4 stars, but through that lens, it's a two."}
{"text":"Terrific steak, nice decor. I certainly can't come up with anything negative about the service, but it's fair to say it failed to match the quality of their food - If you're gonna get a $20 tip, it should be justified by your service, at least partially."}
{"text":"Best steak I have ever eaten.  4 of us went, ate in bar.  Well worth it - pricey, but excellent food.  I ate gnocchi side, some people ate fries, other apps, steak, wine, dessert, etc.  The guys also liked the eye-candy servers in the bar.  Yum yum."}
{"text":"Last night was my final visit to Harbour Sixty. I am sick and tired of them taking advantage of their customers with their upsell techniques. One of my friends asked the sommelier for a wine suggestion around the $100 price range and he comes back with something priced at $190. But the biggest kicker is their disgusting practice of charging $12 for a bottle for tap water. This is f'ing ridiculous! They go out of their way to refill your water glass all night long. Back in Dec we had a large group and they charged $250 for friggin TAP WATER. I confronted the manger and he said it was bottled water - yet it comes from the tap! This is BS and I won't go back anymore. Even their cocktail prices are ridiculous.....$24 for a vodka soda (they claim it is a double shot but it's not). Listen, I may sound cheap but that is not the case. I don't mind paying but Harbour Sixty is over the top and they go out of their way to gauge the customer and homie don't play that. Plus, my steak was undercooked last night and overcooked back in Dec so it seems like they can't even get that right these days. This place has definately gone downhill and I will be going to Jacob's or Morton's in the future. Harbour Sixty just ain't worth it."}
{"text":"There were so many great things about this place and so many things I think can be improved.  
The space - Awesome.  It is a cozy traditional dining space with a DJ playing great lounge electronic music.  
The service - Great but snobby.  On our vacation, we decided we would just drink Canadian wine.  When we were handed the giant wine list book, my friend chose to just ask for a recommendation from the sommelier.  The first thing he said was that he only drinks French wine.  Uhhhhhh okay.  You have a lot more than French wine on your menu and your job is to give us a recommendation from your expertise.  We ended up going with the wine our sommelier from the restaurant we dined at the night before recommended.  That wine was also twice the price as the restaurant we dined at the night before.  I wasn't paying, so that didn't really bother me, but that might be important to others.  Our server asked if we had dined there before and we told her we were from the states and this restaurant was recommended to us.  She responded by asking us if we were staying at the Ritz Carlton or Fairmont.  What?  
The location - the name threw us off because we thought it would be on the harbor and maybe have a nice view.  Nope.  I'm not hating that there's no view, but wanted to mention in case others are reading this and are not from the area and are looking for a restaurant with a harbor view.
Food - Fantastic!  After a day of eating our way through Toronto, we weren't too hungry when dinner came around.  We opted to share a bottle of wine and a few starters rather than having full meals.  One thing that was impressive about this place is the fact that they carry our favorite vodka from the states.  We shared the crab cakes, of course, the halibut ceviche, and tuna tartar.  Everything was fresh and delicious.
Next time I find myself in Toronto, will I return to Harbour Sixty?  Probably not.  But it was definitely a great restaurant and I recommend everyone definitely try it for themselves."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner here the other night on my birthday. Everything is the highest quality with hundreds of bottles of wine to choose from. Pricing is high end but definitely worth it. Great for a classy night out. Would recommend."}
{"text":"The best steakhouse in toronto in my opinion.
It's a classic spot, which I make sure to visit every now and then. It's kinda hard to stay away from this place for too long.

Harbour 60 is on the high-end price point, but it's nothing to regret from that point. The class, ambiance, service and quality is non-measurable with any other in the city.

I usually request to be seated at the Vintages north dining room, and most of the time my request is accommodated unless it's reserved which is acceptable.

The place is great for dates, special occasions or work holiday gatherings.
Starting with the valet parking, to the concierge who takes you to your reserved table, the outing always start with excellence.

I have tried maybe 50% of their menu, and I can't remember one item that I wasn't fully satisfied.

Some signature items to mention here that I recommend are the Tempura Shrimp as an appetizer which comes with amazing coconut sauce..Also, their calamari and meatballs appetizers are amazing and recommended.
In terms of mains, I usually get the New York steak and Porterhouse, which are both the best I've ever tried in Toronto.
Every steak is cooked to perfect as per order, even 'chicago style on a medium rare' which I have ordered a couple of times, where very few restaurants master this cooking level.
Also, as sides, try accompany your meal with Asparagus that comes with a tahini sauce and garlic, and their mushroom which has house wine and other herbs.

You will never regret going to this place, it'll simply make your date that much special and glamorous."}
{"text":"Atmosphere can't be beat. Service (Tom) was fantastic. Food was very good. We had calamari and tiger shrimp for appetizer. The shrimp were the biggest I've ever seen - ever. For dinner we had filet - it was very good but under seasoned. I also tend to like a char on my steak and this was absent. Regardless, steak was still very good. Sides were excellent. Get the cauliflower if you like spicy (has buffalo sauce & blue cheese). Lobster mashed was good. Brussel sprouts were good. They let us get 1/2 sides so we were able to try 4 items versus 2. Much appreciated!  The Chianti they recommend for $115 is very good. Martinis were expensive @ $23.  Excellent visit. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"I was really glad harbour sixty called us the day of our reservation for confirmation. I had remembered it being 2 hours later than it actually was. We made it to dinner early... actually, it was before they were even open.. They seated us anyway and were very accommodating, I only realized later that they weren't even open yet. - completely my error but it was the coldest day of the year and I was pretty scatter brained + hungover

The food was amazing. Expensive, obviously, but you don't show up to one of the classiest steakhouses in the city and expect it to be cheap. We got a bottle of wine that was perfect and started with fresh oysters. Best I've ever had! We each had New York strips and shared asparagus and lobster mashed sides. My steak was beautiful and cooked perfectly. Sides were good too.

We finished with the molten cake. We really wanted to try baked Alaska but it contains nuts :(

One note, my girlfriend has a nut allergy and had a close call w the bread. Their bread is not made in house and one of the pieces contained what looked like walnuts. We were told cross contamination was possible, but this wasn't cross contamination, it was an ingredient.

Anyway, this was a fine dining experience with outstanding service. One of my favourites for sure! Mmm steak."}
{"text":"Went there for New Years Eve dinner. The food and service were great. My wife and I each ordered the Steak and Egg. That consisted of a 10 oz. filet mignon along with shaved truffles and a fried egg sunny side up. The steak was outstanding and cooked to perfection!

The foie gras and Caesar salad appetizers were excellent. For dessert we had their homemade sorbet which was the best ever. (They were out of Baked Alaska).

I have eaten in some of the finest restaurants in the world and I found this place to be a more than decent steakhouse.

I am a foodie and I have no idea why other people complained about the quality of the food here. I found the beef tenderloin to be juicy and very tasty.

Not cheap, but their prices were in line with other steakhouses in the GTA.

I'm certainly coming back."}
{"text":"I only had time for one good meal out while visiting Toronto a while back, and that turned to be at Harbour Sixty.

1 1/2 hours to get apps and my medium rare filet was decidedly medium. You'd think these prices, the steaks would be cooked correctly! Some of the apps and sides were good, but hardly made up for the wait or the overcooked steaks.

There was a good view of the CN Tower from the outside courtyard, and they did give us a free tasting plate of desserts to make up for being so slow (dessert was served 3-3 1/2 hours after we arrived). The desserts were OK, but just typical heavy, somewhat clumsy steakhouse fare.

The wine list had a very interesting selection, but based on the few bottles I recognized from my own cellar, they are marked up a ridiculous 400%. I don't know what is typical in Canadian restaurants, but that is highway robbery in my mind. We ended up going with a single bottle of Duoro for the 3 of us, which was nice, but at $72 was one of the cheapest things on the list.

$100/person (since I refused to buy any more wine at those prices).

Sláinte!"}
{"text":"I GOT ENGAGED! ! !
Thank you Harbour 60 for making my special day amazing!
I don't know what my fiancé had planned with you but I had a great and memorable experience!

Food was to die for!
Great champagne toast for the New Years! 
Will highly recommend for anyone who's looking for a high end classy restaurant!

I felt like I was in the movie Scarface Very Bling Bling!"}
{"text":"Love this place, Mac n Cheese is insane :)   Ahi Tuna is delish!  Lovely, cozy, very friendly place!"}
{"text":"Food and drinks were amazing yes it's $$$$ but you should know that before going here no surprises. Our waiter was super friendly and knowledgeable and really no complaints from us also the coconut cream pie was amazing!!! Well worth it."}
{"text":"Another business dinner at a steak house. Lovely private room underground. Great ambiance! The good, the bar was great, they mix up really decent cocktails, I love bars that pays a great deal of attention to the ice they use. Service was as always amazing. The food again, in my opinion was very mediocre as well, nothing great can be said about them but obviously nothing bad. Let's just say, I don't think I would come here again, I just don't think the food is worth the price tag."}
{"text":"Not great value but that's not why you go here. 
Steak and sides are always amazing. Appetizers could be inconsistent. My foie gras was cold one time yet perfect the other. I like the service and wine selection menu here. Great place to come once in a while!"}
{"text":"Free parking, valet service, beautiful decor, exceptional service, wonderful friendly staff, and fantastic food. 

Situated in the heart of downtown Toronto, Harbour Sixty will transcend you to an era where time stands still. Entering the restaurant you are surrounded by sights beautiful decor.  Scents of sweet flowers as you enter the restaurant. 

Up to the bar for a few drinks and instead of the bar nuts, you're served beautiful applewood smoked stripes of bacon!!  That's right, bacon. 

Seated in the dining room, you're provided a huge wine list from all over the world. 

Steaks are delicious and juicy and our complement dishes were lobster mashed potatoes, mushrooms cooked in white wine and served with thyme.  Side dishes have to be ordered separate from the steak. 

A bit costly, but you can taste the quality."}
{"text":"After having worked across for months, my team and I proudly walked over to Harbour Sixty for lunch today. Extravagant déco., excellent service, and irresistible menu options... I have to admit it was a wonderful experience....

First off, a welcoming hostess led us into a elegant dining area with big comfy chairs. It was classy. Then, a lunch menu that made my choice so difficult because everything sounded really good!! 

Starters: deep fried calamaris with a zing (YUMZA!!) and a beet salad with goat cheese presented like a piece of cake (beautiful and delightful!!)

Main: Lobster sandwich with avocado salad. It was scrumptious!! Big chunks of lobster meat (not cheated with fake crab meat) with lightly smelted brie (I know!!) between two nicely toasted and pluffy (unseen before) bread. I was blown away!!!! To add to my experience, I had a taste of my friend's dish, short ribs with truffle mash. It was sensational..... 

Dessert: rumors have it that their molten choco cake is heavenly. Unfortunately we didnt have time or stomach for it. Ah, twist my arm.... I guess we'll just have to go back!!!

Service: Alex (aka Alexande) shall be recognized for his excellent service. He was courteous, friendly, informative and very accommodating. He threw in a side of pancetta to my meal after I mentioned my passion for pancetta!! He's the BEST!!

Value: let's just say it aint cheap, but it was quite worthwhile. I dont say that a lot about pricey restos because I find that many of them just overprice everything while the quality is questionable. This is a place I would go back for quality food, service and ambiance!! And if all these elements remain consistent, thou shall earn 5 étoiles from moi..... =)"}
{"text":"Wow its great service great pple  awesome foods waiters are very friendly ..and i enjoyed the food..."}
{"text":"Brought some high rolling associates up from the US, expecting to impress- not the case...service staff was extremely rude, most of the items on the menu were sold out or maybe they decided to change the menu in the middle of service? Did I mention how rude the waitstaff were? Bacon way too salty ( I guess they want you to fill up on drinks then leave, since they've run out of everything else on the menu); my black and blue steak  came out medium rare, we tried a bit of everything off the dessert menu, none of it memorable..I should have tipped with Canadian Tire money..wont be coming back"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here for the longest time but saved it for a special occasion... My Birthday! We arrived on a Friday night for our 8:30 reservation. The hostess seated us at a lovely table in the back corner by a windowsill. I loved this seat because we had views into the kitchen, dining room and out the window.

Since it was a celebratory dinner we started off with two glasses of my favourite bubbly prosecco that came adorably adorned with strawberries.

Next the waiter brought us a complimentary basket of warm bread and a platter of olives, pickled peppers, feta, and a garlic spread. Wonderful little noshes to go with our drinks.

Since we were at this epic steakhouse we definitely knew we were going to have steak. Wanting to go all out I asked the waiter what the biggest steak was. He pointed out two cuts to us, one of which was a special that night. The Tomahawk - 40oz - The name alone had me sold

Boy oh Boy was this a monstrous beaut of a steak - it looks like something the Flintstones would eat. The chef actually brought it out to us after cooking it to show us it and asked if we would like it sliced up. Of course we took him up on the offer.

Not only was this steak a feast for the eyes but for the belly - taste wise the it was flawless, cooked perfectly medium rare, tender, flavourful, it had no faults

For sides we had:
Lobster Mashed Potatoes that had huge chunks of meaty lobster and creamy brie folded in and appropriately garnished with a lobster claw
Sauteed Button Mushrooms were plump and juicy with an earthy flavour
Maple Syrup roasted Butternut Squash came out in a fine dice with a crunchy exterior and sweet glaze - the only downfall on this was I wish they were larger cubed dices

After laying out all dishes the waiter then explained each side and then begin serving us.

Finally for dessert I had my eyes set on the special that night

Chocolate Hazelnut Fondant with Hazelnut Ice Cream - The fondant was like a sinfully super moist deep chocolatey nutella flavoured cake. The creamy ice cream was covered in crunchy toasted hazelnuts was a nice balance to cut all the richness. Needless to say I devoured every last bite.

Overall what really stands out about this restaurant besides the food was the service. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful in making recommendations, little touches like the chef showing us the steak before serving us and asking permission to slice it up from the servers explaining all the dishes and plating the food table side for us, writing happy birthday on the dessert plate in chocolate and lighting a candle in it all are little touches that made for a memorable and enjoyable meal. No doubt in my mind that this classic steakhouse will be around for a long time!

FYI They have complimentary Valet Parking"}
