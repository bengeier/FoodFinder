{"text":"One of my favourite Pho places downtown, Song Viet is pretty much open all year round except for Christmas.  I was last here on New Year's Day, hoping that there were some food places open downtown, and I was ecstatic to see that Song Viet was.  They offer a menu very similar to other Vietnamese places in town.  You can find all sorts of Pho (including chicken) plus various rice vermicelli dishes.  The prices are very reasonable here, especially when you consider the portion sizes you get.  Menu prices for appetizers and entrees range from $6-16 with many dishes ranging between $8-12.  You can easily eat your fill for around $10 or less.  If you're a frequent Pho connoisseur, you know that each place makes their broth a little differently.  Here, the broth is light, so if you have a sensitive pallet, or are looking for something whose broth won't overpower everything else in the soup, this one's not too bad.  I've been here often enough to know that if they're running low on ingredients, they'll send someone out to shop at the various stores in Chinatown to bring more in.  So in that sense, many of the food items are fresh like that.  If you're looking for an affordable yet tasty place downtown to satisfy a Pho craving, Song Viet is an excellent choice."}
{"text":"I HIGHLY recommend you skip this one if you're looking for Viet food. After I placed my order with a note and a my phone number to call me if they didn't understand or could accomdate (so I could select something else), they ignored my request and sent my soup with spicy broth I couldn't eat any way. Instead of taking the 30 seconds to call me, I had to drive over there (15 minutes drive) which defeats the purpose of delivery. The person working was also incredibly rude to me, and instead of apologizing started lecturing me on the broth. I also ordered seafood pho. Usually, this means you get a ton of different types of seafood, usually shrimp, crab, squid, and octopus. Song Viet sent me a bowl with three shrimp and one piece of crab. There are way better places with way better value nearby, and from now on I'll be ordering from there."}
{"text":"Nice staff  But that doesn't make up for the lack of flavour  in their dishes the soup is very watery and I needed a lot of extra space to put in to get some taste out of it not as good as some of the Pho places I've been too. not even close"}
{"text":"Food is good. I especially like the sate noodle soup. However I find the service is slow at times and it is not even busy today."}
{"text":"Average pho but great appetizers.  #3, charbroiled pork salad rolls...4 stars. A good portion of tasty marinated grilled pork rolled up with iceberg lettuce and vermicelli noodles. Not the best I've had but worth trying. The rolls come with a hoisin-based dipping sauce.  #6, Song Viet Spring Rolls...4.5 stars. Shrimp and ground pork wrapped in a crispy eggroll wrap. Plenty of mini shrimp in every bite. My only gripe is the interior is a bit soggy cause the pork filling is a little light, leaving too much air space for moisture.  #8, charbroiled pork skewers...5 stars. Excellent. Perfectly grilled marinated pork slices. Very authentic taste!  #16, Mest Ball Pho...3.5 stars.  It's all about the broth and, unfortunately, it's only average. The flavor isn't as bold as I'd like it but will satisfy most Western palates."}
{"text":"Very bland beef pho.....it was just ok and slightly sweet.  Meatball was odd.  Had very ordinary Spring rolls. This place is a super dive."}
{"text":"Dump would not come here served us soggy spring rolls then we sent them back and they recooked them. So they tasted like crap the guys is rude the pork chops where nasty and think like paper, the bathrooms smell like crap. I would never eat here again and nor should anyone else.  I couldn't even finish my food!!"}
{"text":"I would like to give Song Viet a higher rating because their menu has a wicked selection of food and the place is spacious and well spread out however I am solely basing the three stars on their Pho. It was honestly very bland, and I am picky when it comes to good Pho. Also the meat was too rubbery for my taste.   Maybe if I ever come back I'll try something other than their Pho, perhaps they have a better vermicelli dish. Thumbs up to them though for having a wide vegetarian selection."}
{"text":"Food here is very good!!..  The place is not very fancy, but the location is great!,. This is a great place to have lunch in downtown if you work around... Even when is not the best restaurant I have ever been,  I would go back there..."}
{"text":"Shrimp Salad Rolls - Usual fare - OK for me.  Ordered the Fried Rice Noodle with Seafood - 5 shrimps and some pollock, 2 brocolli stems and some bean sprouts - the plate of noodles was very little for $12!  I was appalled!  Not enough to share for 2 people if you're really hungry!  Slow and erratic wait service.  Long lineups to pay during lunch hour."}
