{"text":"A hidden gem with creative yummy food at a reasonable price. Clean and comfortable with a good ambience."}
{"text":"Excellent little restaurant worth visiting. Plan your drive & parking.  Surrounded by commercial industrial shops but worth visiting.

Italian, German & French blended menu.

Sauces & spicing is second to none.
Thoughts of dishes being masterfully spiced & brought to life.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We love coming here and so happy that we found this place! We've been here a few times already, and not only do we receive amazing service, the food is fantastic as well. We have tried their steak, schnitzel, pasta, mussels, and desserts and everything has been delicious. The portions are huge, and there is a lot of care and work that goes into your meal. 

Although you may not notice there is a restaurant where it's located... it is definitely a hidden gem. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent. Good variety of food such as crepes, schnitezel, pasta, vegetarian options. Sizes are huge so go hungry. You can tell its homemade. Prices are crazy cheap but linen table cloths. 
I had eggplant parmesan with chocolate banana crepes for dessert and nice white wine and i loved it all."}
{"text":"Lovely place! Food was yummy and very very affordable. It's a quaint little place with cute decor and you get a lot for what you pay. Me and my sister got an appetizer, two mains and dessert for $41 dollars which is a total steal. Our server was also very kind and checked up on us often. Definitely will come back! My only complaint is that it's only accessible from South of Brock by making a U turn at the light since there's an island there so it can be kinda confusing."}
