{"text":"Pad Thai noodles were good but expensive for what you get. $12 for 5 medium shrimp and noodles. Dont get me wrong, it was good but not a good value."}
{"text":"The most authentic and flavorful pad thai in town, and we have tried Thara Thai, My Thai, Siam Terrace, Basil Thai, and Nitaya Thai (before they closed). We have been to the new location 5+ times already since it is just down the street. The red and green curries are delicious-- we ordered them with extra chicken. The amount of curry you get is a lot more than other places. Pad see ew and pad kee mao were also good but they seemed to have less meat than the pad thai. Both the chicken pho and beef pho were good. Portions are large, and the owner and wait staff are very friendly. If a dish isn't spicy enough for you, you can ask for dried Thai pepper and sprinkle it on top. I would give the decor and ambience a 3.5 since the booths are comfortable and vinyl, but the tv was on the entire time. Cool modern-looking serving dishes and plates. I would rate the value a 4 and give the food itself a 5. You can sometimes get a coupon for the restaurant online which makes it an even better value."}
{"text":"Just got lunch here & there was literally a metal hook in my food that I almost ate. Disgusting"}
{"text":"Vegetarian spring rolls filled with some kind of noodle with brown lettuce. Nasty salty brown sauce with it that tastes like beef broth. The noodle dish tasted like it was seasoned with the same sauce. Overly salty, lacking spices and freshness. I love Thai food, but this was incredibly disappointing. Please use fresh spices and sauces!"}
{"text":"We used to be regular customer there. But the more we went there, we got disappointed each time. When they opened this, its service was good. We specifically like pad thai noodles and even the waiter knows what we order. But last time we went, they served rotten lemon slices along with the noodles. The second last was bad experience though but we thought they might change but their service is no good."}
{"text":"Blech. Where are the negative stars? First, the whole place smelled of cigarettes. Dark, run down and decorated in the early 1970s, the clanging of video poker machines really set a horrific setting. The Crab Rangoons were drab and tasteless. I asked for spice in my Chicken Pad Thai and it came not only not spicy at all, but devoid of taste. Do yourself a favor and go to Panda Express (which I think is only passable as Asian \"cuisine\") instead. I'd like that 25 minutes of my life and $17.52 back, if at all possible."}
{"text":"Place wasn't bad I had the basil chicken and it seemed a little commercialized and was very loud . The sauce was a little sweet for my liking and I ordered  6 spicy and hottest they offered and it wasn't spicy . When I'm in the mood for Thai I want to walk out red faced blowing my nose."}
{"text":"Best egg rolls and spring rolls I've ever had!  My wife has had the pho and I've had the pad kee mao and they were both excellent. My biggest problem is that I love the rolls so much that it's hard to order anything else and pass them up. Owners are super friendly. Brought my daughter and they made a special kid sized meal not on the menu."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch to try. Had green curry, medium hot spice. Flavor was spot on, not disappointed at all. Bowl looked like a giant oriental soup spoon, hard to explain but very cool looking. Ask for daily lunch special, not listed on menu. Very attentive service but not hovering. Look forward to try other items on another visit."}
{"text":"I LOVE the place on Green St and was excited to hear that I didn't have to go into Campustown for my favorite pho.  I order the egg rolls which were awesome! So much better than the other location.  It was light, crispy and filled with veggies and pork (although, I don't recall seeing pork being listed in the description.... but it was just what I was craving for!   The Green St location are those Chinese type egg rolls....big and filled with mostly cabbage.  But these were great.

I ordered the pho with flank (P2)... this is my go-to pho at any restaurant i try for the first time.   It was ok.....not as good as Green St.   the broth was bland, the noodles were overcooked and there wasn't enough flank steak.   I even added a good dollop of hoisen and schriacha..... didn't help.    I so wanted to love the pho, but maybe they're working out the kinks.....  the egg rolls were great.  That's probably why i'll give it another chance."}
{"text":"This was a terrible idea.  Ordered spring rolls came out huge looked prepped days in advance, brown lettuce no cilantro, lemongrass or ginger.  Sent back!  Waitress brought us egg rolls instead-they tasted like they came out of a box and the sauce was not fresh.  My husband ordered the beef basil with rice.  Small portion no spice even though menu mentioned spicy.  I ordered a chai Iced tea which was very good and the beef meatball pho.  It came with a tiny slice of lime a handful of bean sprouts and two slices of jalapeño.  Overall it had about 4 half meatballs in the dish and they were flavorful.  It also had a ton of noodles, good but had minimal scallion with slices of an unidentified meat.  I wasn't sure if it was beef, chicken or pork...  she still charges us for the egg rolls even though we complained.  The lady behind us ordered some kind of pad Thai and sent it back immediately.  The cook came out of the kitchen and scolded her like a child that if she doesn't know if she likes something not to order it because then they have to throw the food away.   LMAO. I couldn't believe it, if I would have been that lady I would have gotten up and walked out.

Any way next to the interesting clientele over at the poker machines which were right in our faces while trying to enjoy a meal, I would not recommend this restaurant.  Not to mention my lips and tongue became swollen after eating, indicating MSG galore.

Again do not eat here.  I'll report back if I don't return from the bathroom."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, this was my first time having Thai food in a restaurant. I went and ordered Chicken Pad Thai because that's the first thing I recognized. I asked for it medium hot, disclaimer you better like spicy food if you order it even medium hot. The food came out pretty quickly, so that was nice. It was a pretty big serving, price was okay, could've been a little cheaper. The food was really good though, good amount of chicken, lots of onions which is awesome because I'm a big fan of onions. Would recommend trying it out!"}
{"text":"Ok 2nd Thai place I have been to in CU so this was ten times better! Had chicken satay & tempura shrimp off the grill and fryer super fast and fresh! Had been beef pad kee mao for first time and was delicious! Server was super friendly and nice! I will come back."}
{"text":"The food is good.  The vibe was unwelcoming however.  I had a cisaves coupon which I don't think they liked even though they put it out there.  When I tried to redeem it the waitress was pretty insistent on trying to take my phone to the back for them to scan it, even when I didn't want to so I had to firmly request they come to the table for that (I've never had a business try to take my phone to the back).  The chef came out and was watching me eat.  I don't know.  Food was good but I won't be back.  There's a fake pleasantry going on here."}
{"text":"DONT EAT THE PH?!!! Great for Thai, bad for Vietnamese food.  All the Thai dishes I've had here are great and I can't seem to find better Thai food on campus.  However, I had a craving for ph? so I here.  I order the Xe Lua (P1) and I was beyond unimpressed.  The broth is very sweet which is totally not right if you know good ph?. The broth should be rich in the flavor of meat that you ordered not watery and sweet.  Ok top of that the meat lacked flavor.  My favorite part about ordering ph? is the huge plate of cilantro, mint, sprouts, limes, green onions, and jalapeños that is supposed to come with it.  They gave me a super tiny plate of bean sprouts with one lime, a few sprinkles of cilantro, and one lime.  NO MINT. This is honestly unacceptable in the ph? world and it shows that they take no honor in their Vietnamese cuisine.  I had to ask for mint and more cilantro and the person working the counter gave me a handful of cilantro sprigs.  They don't have mint. Before this meal I rated Bangkok at a 4."}
{"text":"great service, amazing food!! The food is delicious and unlike other Thai restaurants, the food is authentic like none other."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai was really good. The Pho was good. The service was decent. The restaurant was clean. We got our food really quickly after ordering. My only complaint was that before we went there, I read the menu on their website, and the menu at the restaurant had different prices. It was more expensive than the prices listed online. Also, the website had a kids menu, but the restaurant does not have a kids menu."}
{"text":"I love this place because the food is great and I can rely on them actually being open when all the Thai places in Champaign close randomly over the summer with no updates on google, Facebook, or yelp with their altered hours."}
{"text":"The young waitress has clearly had no experience and is completely ignorant to any of the food on the menu.  Watched her run to get the owner/cook twice during my visit to answer the customer's questions.  The pho is by far better at their campus locations, as well as all of the rest of their dishes - also,  they're about $1 or $2 cheaper on campus.  Asked for half orders for my children to only be charged full price for half the amount of food.  Waitress gave us the wrong check.  I'll go back to try again once they shape up their act, customer service and food."}
{"text":"Very good quality Thai food with a well-designed new interior. I personally judge a Thai establishment by the quality of their yellow curry and this place did not disappoint. I rank it top 2 or 3 in the area. After future visits I might increase to five stars if tastes as good. At $8.95 for most basic entrees the price was reasonable, except I would have preferred a kids menu because each of the entrees the kids got was much bigger than they needed. Leftovers though."}
{"text":"Based on the food alone this place earns 5 stars. I've tried every staple Thai meal served here and each has met or exceeded any other place I've tried. If you try the curry make sure to let the rice soak it up before you start chowing down. You can tell them how spicy you like any dish and they will adjust it to your tastes, I always ask for medium spicy and sprinkle a little lime into the pad Thai. Delicious. 

The atmosphere meets expectations but it is quite obviously a converted bar. TVs are there which provide just enough background noise. This is definitely one of my favorite spots and I would encourage anyone to try it when you're having a craving for something out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Always loved eating at Bangkok Thai but never been to their new place. It's super nice here. I love the curry and fried rice (shrimp). Owner is super nice!"}
{"text":"One of the things I hate most in life is people who have been somewhere once. While working at a place that sold Caipirinhas, the worst people to order them were people who had gone to Brazil once. They had a Caipirinha there and ordered one here and it's just not the same as the one they had that time they were in Brazil. No, it's different, you are different, the setting is different, you kinda suck!
Back in 1994, I spent a month in Thailand, back when I was in the army. I was in the city of Lobpuri. There's a lot of monkeys there. For lunch and dinner, we could eat in the chow hall, or there was another option. Some little old lady set up a food stand directly between the barracks and the dining facility. So, the option was free lunch in d-fac... or little old lady selling food. Always go with the little old lady selling food. For like $1, you could get wide noodles with egg and broccoli, and for like $1 more, get a crap ton of chicken on it. I ate that for like 3 weeks straight. 
The Pad See Ew here reminds me of that time. The noodles are awesome. I have always liked Pad See Ew much more than Pad Thai. I don't like the skinny noodles, but that's just me. 
Man, I was young back then."}
{"text":"Went for a work lunch, six of us. Got seated immediately and service was really good. We all ordered, food came out very quickly. I had Som Tum, green papaya salad. Asked for #4 spicy. It was one of the better papaya salads I've had. There's one place in town that sometimes the lime dressing almost tastes of floor cleaner or something. This was sweet/sour/spicy, just the way it should be. Good sized portions. Everyone in my party enjoyed what they ordered. Got back to the office and had an email that you can get delivery from them through OrderUp. Going to do that. Trying the Thai Beef Jerky with sticky rice next time."}
{"text":"Good food, clean and updated interior, ok prices. My friend and i ordered the sampler appetizer and pad thai and thai iced tea. The tea was great with nice color in a tall glass. The silky cream with the sugar and caffeine tea were great. The appetizer came and the flavors were pretty good but a little bland. Even the dipping sauces lacked character. There was a flavor of cooking fuel on the satay. There was a hair on that plate but i am going to overlook that.  The pad thai was only beef or chix. No option for how spicy you want it. I got the chicken. The plate looked decent and the helping was large.  The plate just lacked character and depth of flavor and had no spiciness to it.  The environment was good overall in the place bit the booths had worn rips in the seats which didn't make sense w the rest of the place being updated. The other drawback was a partition with gambling on the other side which didn't make sense w the flow of the place and in my opinion detracts from it. Would go again but would ask for more spicing."}
