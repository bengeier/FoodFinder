{"text":"I give it a 3 because some of the dishes are not consistent.  Order here often and find that it's easier to go in person to place the order because the people who pick up the phone barely speak English and even when you give the name or number of the menu item you're ordering they don't know their own menu.  Also, if you pick up and pay cash they give you a 10% discount.  The containers they put the takeout in aren't very sturdy and are taped shut.  It's an ok place to go to order quick sushi."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for all-you-can-eat Japanese food in Willowdale.  The store is quite small and oddly shaped; its triangular shape means that the seats are often too close to anybody walking by.  However, for a store space so close to Yonge and Finch and without its own parking lot, parking on Yonge Street is remarkably easy because this mall has mostly hair salons and health-product stores that close much earlier than dinnertime; I've gone to this place four times in three months and have never failed to find street parking.  It's not free, though.  I like the food here; its hot food is especially good, sashimi pieces are large, and the menu has a great deal of variety.  Service is a bit hit or miss; the staff is pleasant, but this restaurant appears to be a small, possibly family-run business so staff sometimes gets overwhelmed.  You can see they make an effort, however.  And the price is a good $2 to 3 lower than the other all-you-can-eat Japanese place around here, Sushi One."}
{"text":"Owned by Chinese people, service is alright, you have to try a few times before getting their attention. Ordered 3 different types of dragon rolls for $27 and found it just alright. I have had better in other Japanese restaurant. Sashimi on the top of the rolls were fresh but the roll itself has too much rice which fills you up really fast. Probably won't go back in the near future."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed with the terribly slow service. The food was ok overall. we only had a few rolls and  it took 1hour from ordering to getting it, then wait for another 1hour for another roll. Me and my boyfriend were out of patience , had to cancel the order and left.... This will be the last time we go there."}
{"text":"Pretty slow service, maki rolls have a little too much rice, and tempura rolls (yam, green dragon, shrimp) are soggy. They should be freshly fried and then put in the rolls. Fried udon and sweet and sour chicken were pretty good. Pretty expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"Came at around 8:30pm on a Friday night with a group of about 10 for all you can eat. It wasn't that busy but our food took FOREVER (30-45 minutes) for one plate to come out. They forgot one of our orders and then insisted that we didn't actually put the sheet in even though we handed it to a waitress. We had asked a couple of waitresses to please bring us soup and they insisted they would bring it. Yet again, it was forgotten. I had asked for tea for the entire table and I was told it was coming. Another forgotten request... By the time the waiter came to fill up our tea, he was extremely upset and seemed to be tired of serving us. Overall, it was a very frustrating experience and once I was able to actually eat the food, it wasn't worth the wait."}
{"text":"I honestly loved this place!!! Everything I had was so fresh. My favourite was the white tuna sushi/sashimi. Melts in your mouth! For an all you can eat place, I was super super impressed! Maki rolls were delicious, and the hand rolls were perfectly crunchy. Only thing that I didn't really care for was the service. It was a bit slow. The food though was amazing! Probably the best AYCA sushi place I've frequented so far!"}
{"text":"** update*** I feel so let down.  This was my favourite restaurant. I used to tell people that they should go. On October 3rd I went for the dinner buffet. They were very slow to respond to me.  I'm not entirely sure but I think the waiter flirted with the waitress whenever they went into the kitchen. When I wanted to give them my order I sat staring at them giggle and flirt for 15 mins before they realized that they had customers to help. Even then I had to catch him as he was walking to get him to take my order. At one point I was sitting with a pile of used plates for a whole 30 mins before anyone realized. The food was great but the service was really bad this time around.  I don't think I'll be returning..."}
{"text":"I've yet to try their AYCE menu, so my review doesn't cover that. I've had sushi from this restaurant countless times over the years. I used to exclusively order their sushi pizza, which was my favourite and I've yet to have a better sushi pizza from another restaurant. All of the things I've tried (sushi pizza, beef teriyaki, salmon teriyaki, various rolls) have been good. I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"Good inexpensive sushi lunch.  Staff were attentive and folksy.  They have an all you can eat menu but didn't try it."}
{"text":"I've lived here my whole life, and never bothered to go to this sketchy looking place underneath an old apartment but after reading urbanspoon reviews I was inclined - they hold an 83% rating with 54 reviews on urban spoon. Not hating on yelp, but urban spoon is pretty much the ubiquitous mutual consensus for people who don't have time to write 250 words on restaurants. It's a bit pricey, but equals to downtown AYCE sushi. By far the best AYCE sushi I've had. They haven't messed one thing up...well I only usually get tempura, short ribs, salmon/tuna sashimi, spicy salmon maki rolls but that's basically the greatest parts of sushi.   Sashimi is they key determinant to sushi quality - they don't mess up their salmon sashimi. Hand rolls are great, and tempura is crispy and batter is fresh and not overdone and drenched. Come here for a nice 20 dollar AYCE night, and I promise you won't be disappointed. It beats going to richmond hill or markham just for an AYCE fix. If you find I am lying feel free to rate this review as bad (:"}
{"text":"All You Can Eat Sushi places are great but this place doesn't live up to the expectations of a vegetarian, your options will be very limited, I think I only had 5 things that I could actually eat from the menu.  My friends who eat fish / meat said everything that they ordered tasted great and was good quality.  For how much you pay here it isn't worth it for a vegetarian to go All you can eat, so I would suggest ordering from the menu instead if you are vegetarian.  It has a nice an cozy atmosphere, and service can be rather slow, but I do not mind waiting as I know good food made from scratch and with love takes time."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Sushi is fresh, there's a lot of variety and it's reasonably priced. Don't get turned off by it's dated decor and cramped space, it's some of the best sushi I've had. It gets busy on weekends so make a reservation or go early!"}
{"text":"On our visit the only thing I found decent to eat was a crab maki roll and the green tea ice cream. Everything else was pretty mediocre tasting and of low grade even taking into account that this is AYCE sushi restaurant.   Misses - tuna sushi was not fresh, tempura was tasteless and not crisp,  Agedashi tofu no flavour, beef teriyaki tough to chew and low grade cut (round steak), portion sizes for the cooked dishes are small and about half the size of what's typical. Maki rolls and hand rolls were sloppy in preparation.   We were seated in the corner and noticed the floor was dirty, like it's been mopped over several times with the dirt packed into the crevices. Also found odd that tea cups we received were non-matching, maybe they ran out of matching cups or didn't think we would notice/care.   Food preparation areas appears clean and tidy and the one waitress working at lunch was friendly. There's two menus available, a lunch only menu for $14.99 and all-day full menu for more $$ if you so choose."}
{"text":"I have tried many Sushi all you can eat places in the GTA and this is one of the best places I have ever come across.  Their Sushi is excellent and is presented very well.  I especially like their 'Dragon Rolls' which looks great and tastes even better.  Unlike some of the other all you can eat places there is no restriction on what you can order and you can order anything from their long menu.  The staff / owner is very friendly.    Ahh one more thing.. Their Wasabi is the real deal..  Most all you can eat places gives you Wasabi that tastes like cement.. You can really notice the difference at My Sushi where the Wasabi taste authentic & excellent.   I have given 4 stars only because they can be a little show during the peak hours.... However the wait is fully worth it.  If you know and love Sushi then this place is 'Highly Recommended'!!!"}
{"text":"Love going to My Sushi. Love the renovations they did over the summer, the place is looking great! The service is always good here. I love the large selection of rolls they have. There was one with cream cheese and shrimp that was unbelievable! The sashimi is always fresh which is very important. The price for the all you can eat option is unbeatable. There are tons of sushi places in this area and My Sushi by far blows the rest out of the water. My only issue is with parking. I asked the server where the parking is she said it's in the back, I have never found it. I have been going to this place for about 2 years now and still haven't found the parking. You have to pay to park on the street, but when the weather is nice it isn't too far of a walk from the subway station if you are using public transit to get here."}
{"text":"Great AYCE Sushi for the area... most sushi places around Yonge and Sheppard are a la carte. This is one of the only AYCE.  Recently re-opened after being closed for 2 months of renovations. There is more seating now than before and enough tables for a few groups of 6. Only down side, with the renos came a menu price increase. For a table of 2 on a Saturday night it came to $61 (including tax) plus a tip on top of that $61...and that's without alcoholic drinks. However the quality is great and we have no complaints on the service!"}
{"text":"The variety of food is not that good but is decent for the price. We ordered too much because we expect smaller amout for each dish of buffet... The sushi is twisted and not good...  Good we are Not bug fun of sushi anyway. The cutlets are good and other things seemed standard. Can go if you live close to it and want Japanese buffet still."}
{"text":"I've been to My Sushi several times and the one thing I will say about the service is that it's a little inconsistent. Sometimes they're super friendly and excited to see you and sometimes they won't even look you in the eye. The restaurant itself is a little dark as some people mentioned but you get used to that after a while.   The menu has the standard all you can eat options, I don't think I felt that anything was missing or anything is inventive either. The price on weekends is a little high but it's not much more expensive than other sushi places.   If I'm in the mood for sushi but don't feel like driving or taking transit, My Sushi is usually my Plan B."}
{"text":"I came for weekend AYCE. It's a very small and dark place, which makes it a very depressing place, there wasn't even any background music. Sashimi wasn't very fresh and the service wasn't so good, they didn't leave any menu to re-order, and was reluctant to provide a new one. And their wasabi didn't have any taste. Not too sure how they managed to screw up the wasabi... But ok sure. And very slow service. Overall this place is subpar, and i doubt I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Great location if you're in North York. Tons of seating, attentive staff and delicious shrimp fried rice. The sushi was ok though (I have personally had better)"}
{"text":"This AYCE Sushi place is located so conveniently for me not to try them out. They are a little hidden because their sign does not stand out at all - there are some trees blocking it as well.   It was easy getting a table since it was relatively empty. The interior was dark and cramped. Our table was still a bit sticky and the soy sauce dispenser was empty..   The fried and cooked dishes all tastes microwaved. The tempura was not crunchy but instead soggy..   Sushi choices weren't many nor were they creative in any way. Sashimi options were standard - salmon, white tuna, surf clam, kani, egg...etc. I found the slices too thick and not particularly fresh.   They also sell bubble tea which was the only thing that stood out, but I didn't order it because who orders bubble tea at a Japanese AYCE place?   I'm sorry, this place was disappointing just as their exterior restaurant design shows they don't put much care or effort to running their business."}
{"text":"Terrible all you can eat experience.   The service was incredibly slow. Had to ask several times for everything (including the menu). We eventually just started getting up and getting our own menus. It was nearly an hour from the time that we walked in that we got out first sushi rolls.   Our orders were mixed up with the other tables several times. If you like sashimi order double what you normally get as a piece of sashimi here is exactly half the size of other places - they cut the pieces horizontally down the middle before serving.   Food wasn't great either.    The air conditioning was hardly on during one of the hottest days of the year. And there was no soap in the men's washroom - health inspector? I love the fact that the chefs then dealt with the raw food without wearing gloves.  I'm of the view that a tip is earned and not assumed. When I left a very low tip the waitress asked me why and I told her that the service was very slow. She started yelling at me in front of the other guests saying that she knew but it was because of how busy they were and if we came earlier or later in the day next time that it would be perfect.   There won't be a next time and the restaurant was not nearly full."}
{"text":"I visited with my friends for AYCE. The food came in quickly and the quality was alright. I especially did not like the karaage (Japanese deep fried chicken) because the batter was too powdery. The \"deep fried milk\" was something I have not tried before, and it tasted good. The service became slow towards the end of our meal. I did not appreciate that the server did not give me a receipt. I asked for multiple times but she did not even try. Could it be that she did not understand me? I don't think I want visit again to find out."}
{"text":"Used to be my go to but better options now.  Food: 3/5 Small selection.  Service: 3/5 Fast but doesn't check up on you. Environment: 4/5 Remodelled and pleasant. Washrooms: 2/5 Tiny and not wheelchair accessible. Worth it?: 3/5 Selection is too limited but priced okay.  Pencil and paper checkbox ordering system.  We have been coming here for years. It seems like the food hasn't changed and that is there major downfall. The AYCE menu has remained the same while competing restaurant have experimented and added new items. The food is okay but there always seems to be too much rice on all the rolls. Bbq eel and spicy salmon rolls also have too much cucumber and crispy filler. Salmon sushi however are made with large thick slices of salmon but still stuffed with too much rice. Dessert options are limited.  Service is fast but not as diligent as one would hope. You will have to request for tea and soda refills if you want one. Not much is done to charm their customers but they are not rude, just very efficient.   This place has gone through a few remodels. Some of them more minor like the removal of the long barrier down the middle of the dining room. Everything is clean which is always nice to see. The washrooms however are tiny with a half sink. Not wheelchair chair friendly or tall person friendly.   The overall experience is always okay. We are left alone for the most part so it's a great place to catch up with friends. We always come back here when we are looking for AYCE sushi on the cheaper end. You miss out on selection but the quality and cleanliness is there."}
{"text":"I came here the other day to order take-out and I had a really good experience. Since I am both gluten and lactose intolerant, I am limited with my options but I decided to be a little creative.  I ordered a salmon avocado roll and an order of butterfish sashimi. I asked the employees if they could put the butterfish on top of my sushi and they happily agreed. I now had a salmon avocado roll with butterfish on the outside.   The sushi was very fresh and melted in my mouth. The employees gave me extra ginger (as requested) to flavour my roll. I was very happy with my order and would definitely return to this location for takeout or to dine-in at the restaurant."}
{"text":"My Sushi is my go-to AYCE sushi restaurant  FOOD QUALITY: The sashimi is fresh for an AYCE a place and comes in good cuts. You won't get the crappy reject pieces here. If you're a RED TUNA fan, you can get it here - and its one of their best fish on the menu (comes in sushi, roll, and hand roll only, not sashimi.) I recommend their blow torched roll, called the super tuna roll (a sneaky disguise name), though it could be a tad heavy on the mayo at times. The cooked food is nice. I especially enjoy the chicken karage (deep fried chicken) and their octopus balls. For dessert, their fried sesame balls are a real treat! All in all, the food quality is great and in my opinion, is comparable to some decent a la carte sushi places in the neighbourhood.   SERVICE: Generally, the service staff are friendly and polite but they could be easily swamped when the restaurant gets too busy and then, become inattentive. They're Hit or miss.    ATMOSPHERE: Booths and tables. Nice decor. But it is HOT in that restaurant. They do crank up that heat in the winter!"}
{"text":"The all you can eat menu is not that extensive and the sushi quality is mediocre.The service is not fast but they ask you if everything is OK every time the server comes to your table. You need to ask them to provide you with extra sheet which they hesitate to bring you if you ask for the third or forth time. I went for lunch today but feeling kind of bloated right now. I tried Yang Yang's kitchen last week and the quality of the Sushi is not comparable. The chef for My Sushi is not a real sushi chef. I believe the Lady who is a server is the owner as well and it seems everybody is afraid of her. Over all the the portion of the rice is too much and the quality of the salmon is OK but it is very thin.You don't feel the Salmon or even Avocado.It just doesn't satisfy your taste buds. The hand roll is good but again too much rice and and the only reason I am not giving it 1 star is because the Salmon Teriyaki was very delicious. The washroom is kind of dingy and out dated but not dirty."}
{"text":"Omg!!!!!! YUMMY!!!! Super clean and tidy. Fast and yummy. It is a really comfortable place for sushi and the waiters and waitress has really good servings (it's really fast). Also, the food are really fresh and clean."}
{"text":"The sign outside makes the restaurant very unappealing, so I never even considered trying it out. But tonight a friend dragged me there insisting it is good. Let's just say I don't resent his insistence at all.   The inside looked nothing like the outside. It is a smaller restaurant, with booths on both sides. The light is dimmer than the usual restaurant. Their soy sauce container had a cork...let's just say i was impressed with the interior, especially when comparing it to the yellowish sign outside.  The food was alright. Not the best, but definitely not the worst. It is on par with non-ayce places (and better than some). I didn't try a variety of food, but....  Their sashimi varied in quality. The first order was pretty good. You can taste the fish and it wasn't chewy or anything. But the second order of sashimi was just...nasty. It was like eating rubber.  The sushi had a decent amount of fish on it, but still quite a bit of rice.  I am not a fan of their rolls for sure. Their spicy salmon roll had a lot of \"crispy\" things and very little salmon. The Philadelphia roll had a load of cream cheese and barely and smoked salmon. Their rainbow roll was alright though...can't complain about the california rolls having less fish than it is suppose to.   The service was average.   But considering that it is an AYCE restaurant, pree' good."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch specifically hoping for Ika(squid) sushi, was craving it since yesterday. To my disappointment they only offer it in the a la carte menu.   This is an AYCE Japanese restaurant owned by Chinese owners.   The AYCE menu is very small for weekdays, even smaller for lunch. Yes, you can order as much as you want but from a small variety.   I didn't go for AYCE. Went for the sashimi lunch and ordered extra Ika sushi on the side. Which came up close to the price for AYCE, way smaller portions.   The sashimi isn't very fresh and the service is just passable for my standards. I'd be better off going to ume sushi or sushi bong and for AYCE Sushi Legend( Leslie and finch) all the way. I probably wouldn't come back anytime soon. I only came in out of convenience anyways."}
{"text":"Ordered a sashimi combo off uber eats. Extremely tiny portions for almost $30, poor quality and only positive was it arrived in about 10 minutes which makes me think it easy fresh because it also made 2 people sick. Overall will never order again from this place."}
{"text":"I love this place. Ive been going there for over 2 years and ive never had a bad or neutral experience. The all you can eatprice has gone up a bit but its still worth it. The selection is huge and the food is fresh and well presented. The place is clean and well kept. The washrooms can be a bit gross at times and the door for the entrance/exit is always smudged up with fingerprints. He service is great and the staff is nice. One of the best ayce places in north york"}
{"text":"This place is excellent - at least it was when I used to live in the condo's upstairs and would come down for their all you can eat buffet, made to order.  Always fresh and service was friendly.  Miso soup was always really good - never skimping on the amount of miso."}
{"text":"We came in for all you can eat. The selection you choose was quite large and seemed like a good deal for 30.00 on a weekday. I think that getting the special rolls were a huge mistake. The quality of sushi rice was horrible and over layered (some had two layers). The deep fried crips were oily and you can taste dirty oil. One special roll was dipped in tempura then fried. The texture and temperature of the roll was disgusting. They served a few slices of herb salmon in a large chipped dish The real fruit mango smoothie did not taste like real fruit. The dishes that were worth it: karaage, edemame, takoyaki, tempura shrimp, beef cubes, tataki, sashimi, handrolls, seaweed salad, avacado rolls, maki. The hand rolls and maki had better sushi rice. The food came fast but the server didnt bother to tell us what was what and it was hard to tell because they took away the original menu. We weren't topped up for tea or water and we had to take order sheets from the next table. Our bill came to around 80.00. For that amount of money I think you could have better food quality and service at Kinka Izakaya. The meal was ok but I wouldn't come back unless my choices were limited."}
{"text":"Eh, came here with Ana because its super close to her house.  So many issues, but I'll probs be back with her.  Let's do the good:  1. Fried Oysters YUM 2. Service was awesome! The lady forgot to give us chopsticks twice, but she was so nice and spoke english :) Pretty much the only reason I'm giving it two stars. 3. Lots of fried items! 4. The Shrimp Temps were amazing!   The Mediocre: 1. Galbi was dissappointing. 2. The Rolls were huge, but only because there was so much rice stuffed into it! 3. The sashimi was cut weird. Ana loved it,  but it didn't look too appetizing to me. Oh and the Surf Clam was so tiny.   The Bad 1. The booths were tiny. I couldn't fit and was super uncomfy. 2. The Beef Mushroom Rolls tasted so bad.  3. THE ROLLS WERE SO FULL OF RICE.  4.  13.95 for lunch??  5. Service Charge for three people???  The only reason I`d go  here again:  1. The Location. 2. The Server was too sweet to not go again."}
{"text":"This newly renovated My Sushi appears to be under new ownership because their food quality has risen incredibly.   I was eating their AYCE lunch and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of their fish and their kitchen food. I understand their price have increased a $1 - $2 / person but I would pay a little extra for higher quality product.   I give this place a solid 5 and I would recommend all sushi lovers to give it a try!"}
{"text":"I started to get into Sushi about 5 years ago. My Sushi is a really great place to go with friends and try the all you can eat sushi, the spicy mushroom tempura are my absolute favorite and the avocado covered California roll.  My only complaint is that the service is supper slow at times it seems that the wait staff forgets there running a restaurant and don't even come by the table. We had to yell at them to come over."}
{"text":"Went here for second time in 2 months because I was happy with my first visit. This time around unfortunately, not so much. The first strike was when we entered... there was a smell of urine in the air. Second strike was when we ordered pop for ourselves & orange juice for our young kids. The pop cans had a crusty film on the top and the orange juices were a brownish orange. When we looked at the expiry date it was 7 months passed the BB date. Unacceptable.... the thought of my kids drinking that and getting violently ill .... I was pissed. The 3rd strike was the appearance of the raw seafood behind the glass. I've been to enough sushi places to recognize fresh fish and what I saw definitely wasn't fresh. I proceeded to order only cooked items from the AYCE menu as I didn't want to take the chance. The food that we did order tasted fine but with so many good sushi places in York Region I don't think I'll be coming back to My Sushi. When it comes to raw seafood there's simply no room for mistakes. And when you overlook something as simple as a brownish bottle of juice..."}
{"text":"Went to this place for dinner second time in five years just because my boyfriend said he wanted to go there. An AYCE place owned by Chinese owner, the menu is just like all the other AYCE places, nothing too special.   My first time going there I wasn't too impressed either.   The same price you paid for could of have something else with better quality in another restaurant. Sashimi is okay as expected, not amazingly fresh but good enough. They have white tuna sushi but not white tuna sashimi, the only down side of this place.  The services are okay as well, as long as they don't bother me and they didn't have a bad attitude, they are attentive enough but only because there were only 3 tables including mine."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at My Sushi. Over the past three years, they've been through a renovation, but the food quality and the staff has remained the same. The food is always fresh, and the staff are always friendly. The service could be slow if you're going with a large group. My favorite item on the menu is their spicy tempura mushroom. The rice to fish balance for their rolls its quite good for an AYCE place. I certainly recommend this spot for a sushi fix."}
{"text":"Salmon sushi pizza Salmon sushi hand roll Salmon sushi  $38.40  Rice tasted weird Sushi had a stale after taste  Drowned my salmon sushi in soya sauce and it still didn't help get rid of the awful aftertaste  They charge you extra for fish eggs (The girl kept telling me it was 5 cents extra and they charged me $2.50 When I spoke to the manager he said it was 50 cents extra per order)  The girl taking my order couldn't spell or understand English  The food was awful , I usually order from Vip sushi whose prices and food taste way better.   Felt like trying something new today but thoroughly disappointed   Back to VIP I go!"}
{"text":"I am just ITCHING to review this newly discovered neighbourhood \"gem\".  FIRST OF ALL, at 9pm there were two other people at this restaurant. An AYCE sushi restaurant. On humpday out of all days! AND it's cheap too - $18.95 for dinner (Mon - Thur). I was very skeptical from the get go...  SECOND OF ALL - THERE IS NO GALBI! I don't want to repeat myself...but do you understand the severity of the situation when an AYCE place does not have Galbi? It's severe. It was almost enough to make me walk right out. I did cry, making my companion slightly uncomfortable.  There was also no white tune - apparently there is a market shortage? I thought that was only bacon...  The chairs (in the booths) are extremely uncomfortable, they're too hard (that's what she said! there. moving on.) and too straight. I never noticed chairs before, in any restaurant that I've been in but I did notice it here - I felt like leaning back was not an option.  THIRD - you have to pay extra for seaweed salad. $1 and you can order as much as you want. There are other items that you have to pay extra for but order as many times as you would like...I was still sad (again) because god know I love me some chewy ocean grass!  The sushi were ok - not much selection on the menu overall. The Dynamite and Spider rolls were great, not too much rice. The hand rolls were pretty dees too. Sashimi pieces were too small. Shrimp tempura was hard and oily as opposed to fluffy and crispy. And deep fried squid was raw, im 99.9% positive it wasn't cook through.   I do not recommend this place. I will go here occasionally because it's literally a block away from my condo. If you want quality and can travel - CHOOSE A DIFFERENT PLACE!"}
{"text":"Pricey, but worth.  If you're into fancy looking sushi places with good food, this place is for you. The reason being is they have delicious a** food. The only thing you should be worried about is the price and if it's really busy because the waitresses often get overwhelmed...  This one time, my friend was paying with credit card, and one of the waiters got really stressed and accidentally (or maybe on purpose) cancelled the transaction after taking the machine away from my friend... and he had to do it again. The other waitress handling our transaction was confused herself and frustrated about the situation... so yeah. Other than that, the food is delish."}
{"text":"This is one of those moments I'm glad I didn't read the Yelp reviews. This place is right in my backyard and I've been walking past it for a number of months. I'm a fan of AYCE sushi, although I understand you trade off quality or quantity . There are not many AYCE places up here in North York. I usually head downtown to Kyoto House for some reliably passable AYCE sushi.   But weather and a back injury at the gym had me and Ms. Brooks Brothers finally giving My Sushi a try. And I have to say, I was quite pleased. The Friday night/weekend night menu is really awesome. There's a bit of inconsistency. The tuna sushi was great but the tuna rolls were a bit meh. A real find is the ginger ice cream on the dessert menu. I didn't think I'd find anything better than red bean. I'd come back here just for the ginger ice cream.  Service was good. The place is not big but they had 3 people working the floor and seemingly working each table.  I understand there are some bad reviews but either we hit this place on a night where they were firing on all cylinders or they've seen some bad reviews and have recently pulled up their socks."}
{"text":"They offer fresh sashimi, delicious rolls, grilled and fried dishes (their short BBQ ribs are a must). I like that their miso soup is not sweet or extremely salty as I've had bad experience with soups at other sushi restaurants before. I've been here with family and friends several times now and it's lived up to our expectations. The only downside is fair amount of rice on sushi but it is an ayce after all. Friendly staff, average price, and street parking is available if not, the subway isn't too far of a walk."}
{"text":"This restaurant is FANTASTIC!! I ordered sushi through JustEat as the weather was horrible outside and didn't want to venture out in the freezing rain and cold. The food was super fresh and super tasty!  JustEat said that they will deliver by 12:25, the food arrived at 12:24, wow, that was accurate.  I ordered (not all for me of course) the Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box, Edamame, the Dynamite roll, Dynamite and Spicy Tuna and the Dynamite and Spicy Salmon.  All were fantastic (according to my colleagues). I had the Dynamite roll and Spicy Salmon sushi was was so damn delicious. Big shrimp in the Dynamite and huge pieces of avocado, and the salmon was so fresh and tender with crunchy bits inside, that actually were crunchy when I ate my food an hour after it arrived.  I cannot praise this sushi restaurant enough.  Lastly, the delivery person was so very nice and friendly.  You should try this place out...it is wonderful!"}
{"text":"Went for  AYCE lunch today, the price is 14.99 for holiday. I find that the menu is smaller than the other sushi buffets that I've been to (Sushi Fun, Sushi Legend) and the food was just average. Nothing really stood out other than the multiple flavours of ice creams (vanilla, green tea, red bean, mango, ginger). They only had one waiter so we would always steal the menu from the other tables in order to get some extra servings"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in North York! I've been going to this place for years and it's hands down the best AYCE sushi place (I have been to Aji San, KaKa, Heart Sushi, Matsuda, Sushi One and Ten Ichi). No lie, I come here almost once a week with my boyfriend! In terms of AYCE, it has the most fresh and consistent fish quality that I have had by far. I have never had a bad experience in food quality. Only downside in service is that sometimes they miss an item in your order, however that is not that big of a deal because you can just place an order for it.  Another thing that's awesome about this place is the value that you're getting for your meal. For example, AYCE lunch during the week costs $16.99 and on the weekend (Fri - Sunday) $17.99.  I've tried everything on the menu, here are my favourite dishes: Hand Rolls (Salmon Avocado, Spicy Salmon, BBQ Eel), Rolls (Dynamite, Tuna, Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Salmon), Sushi (Salmon and White Tuna), Tempura, Chicken Cutlet, Beef Teriyaki, Beef Ribs, Squid Tentacles, Beef Mushroom Rolls  If you haven't tried this place yet... you're missing out!!!

{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night for their AYCE menu. What can I say....serious let down! Sushi had way too much rice. The seaweed on the handroll did not have the typical crispiness, it was hard to bite off. Also, usually rainbow roll includes tuna..that's what makes it look like a rainbow!! But they are too cheap to serve tuna with the roll. Their hot dishes are also very underwhelming. In short for those who want decent sushi save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Before my office moved downtown, we used to come here for \"all-you-can-eat\" sushi at lunch.  I'm no sushi-connaisseur, but I know the difference between decent and crap sushi.  This sushi is good and if you've got an appetite, the \"all-you-can-eat\" is a great option.    I love the deep fried crab maki.  Yummy!!  The decor is dated, the furniture looks like it came from a dorm room eating area, but the food is enjoyable and reasonably priced.  It's a small space so it gets packed on weekends by 6-7pm."}
{"text":"Went for ATCE lunch on a weekday.  The service was good, the server attentive and ready to refill my tea and Miso Soup. Speaking of which, the miso soup was nice, I don't care for tofu and so it was nice it didn't have much. The Salmon Sushi is the best of the sushi I think, the portion size to rice ratio was really good. The others were normal in terms of rice/meat ratio. My pictures contain mini reviews of the dishes. The place was clean, the music was pleasant, and there was a lot of room.  For the price one cannot complain, but there is a lot of rice in the rolls I tried, I would hope there is not so much in the non-AYCE menu."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Everything we ordered from the AYCE menu was very tasty and fresh (including sashimi). They have a good variety of rolls. Service could be improved though."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Had to ask for the essentials; water, table setting, even wasabi and ginger (which is essential for sushi restaurants??). The waiter never asked us if we needed anything and only looked annoyed when we did ask. Food took forever to come.. my friend had to ask one of the waitresses if the food on the ledge was ours because it was sitting there for 10 min. The waiter was confused about our bill and had to reprint it 3 times.    Crammed space. Table set up was poor. It was hard to get out without asking the person beside you or behind you to move their seat. Also because of the tight space waiters were slower because they had to wait until someone passed.   Wait time. We spent more time waiting for food then eating. Many times we could see our food ready on the ledge but the waiters were nowhere to be seen.    Food was average. The only positive thing about the restaurant was that the food was not too bad. But definitely not worth the money $26.99 (for ayce dinner)   I do not recommend this place, especially for ayce dinners."}
{"text":"Service here is painfully slow. Only one other table here and it still took forever to get the food. Order was missing items. The food is just decent at best and the selection is standard."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery in the afternoon on a Thursday. I ordered Red Dragon, Dynamite, Spicy Tuna and Spicy Salmon and Salmon Sashimi. The spicy tuna and salmon looked old, and red dragon and dynamite broke apart in my chop sticks due to them being so loosely rolled. The sashimi was not served with radish shavings, but the actual fish was good.   Definitely not great for delivery. My girlfriend enjoyed the food in restaurant for the all you can eat buffet. That's why I gave it 2/5 instead of 1/5."}
{"text":"I don't know how some other people thought their sushi was great. Maybe they have a different chef on other days? At any rate, their menu looked appetizing. But the execution of ths sushi wasn't as great. Most of our rolls were falling apart as soon as we touched them. And the ingredients didn't seem to be of the best quality. Veggie tempura was very oily & not even drained before serving. Veggie spring rolls were delicious. Our first order was a larger size & the second order of the spring rolls were half the size. I joked to my hubby if we ordered a third order would it be even smaller? Not my idea of a great AYCE sushi place."}
{"text":"All You Can Eat (AYCE) sushi should never mean cutting corners.    I decided to come here for the first time and the experience was 'just okay'.  Sushi, nigiri, rolls, cones all depend on a properly prepared rice base.  If the rice is bland and if the chef puts too much rice in the serving then it ruins the sushi experience.  There were two menus for lunch.  One did not have sashimi and the other did (for $14.99 wknd lunch).  The sushi was underwhelming and on the bland side due to the rice, some of the fish were fresher than others.  The nigiri tuna and salmon were cut thinner than anywhere I've been, but the inagi (eel nigiri) was very good.    The tempura on the other hand was perfectly hot and crispy in its glorious tempura batter.  Both vegetable and shrimp tempuras were awesome.  The avocado hand rolls were also a highlight.  The miso soup was okay, but nothing special.  The service was friendly but dare I say discombobulated.  I don't know if the waitress just woke up, but she wasn't very good at bringing everything in due order, but in a piece meal manner.    The presentation of the food is nothing special either, it's sushi on a plate and you are expected to eat it not admire it.  Which takes away from the spirit of Japanese presentation.  The restaurant itself can use a good updating as the 1990's decor is a little old.  Anyhow, this place will not be a regular place for me, perhaps when I need AYCE sushi in a pinch but no more than that.  I'll definitely be looking for a better AYCE sushi place.  END"}
{"text":"Decent quality for a reasonable prize, I'd not recommend to get sashimi though, aside from that and the poor customer service (even when there are very little people) it's a good place to go and get some good sushi"}
{"text":"Great AYCE sushi here with you are in the area. Although they take reservations, there isn't a lot of space so making reservations is ideal for larger parties.  Service here is extremely friendly. Food selection is fantastic as you'll see some menu items that you don't see in other AYCE restos. I'm a big fan of grilled octopus on skewers and any maki rolls with tempura and avocados on the outside. They have a great selection of desserts. sashimi seems pretty fresh altho we usually only eat salmon.   Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Lovely cozy place with yummy sushi. I visited Toronto and had a sushi buffet with my friends here. My friends said it is hard to find a buffet sushi restaurant in Toronto. The price is fair and the food was well prepared. The server is very nice. I had a great time with my friend. Cheers."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant before with my son and his girlfriend. Why they go back, is a mystery to me. The area is full of much better quality Sushi restaurants. We arrived a group of 5 people for dinner, again, ONLY because my son insisted (I guess its close to his home). As soon as we sat down, we were informed that if we wanted to sit together, we all had to order their all-you-can-eat. Well, 4 of them wanted to, but I, already having been here and not being impressed with the quality of food, said that Id only have a Bento-Box. No, the waitress insisted, I couldn't sit with the group, Id have to move tables and sit alone!! Well, I can understand to a certain extent, the restaurants concern, that people take advantage of eating without ordering. I told her, that everyone was ordering food, including me, just not all-you-can-eat and it was out of the question that Id sit alone. Either we all sit at one table or we all leave. Of course she relented, the restaurant almost empty, I guess she realized that she'd be loosing 5 diners. We ordered our food and throughout the entire meal, we had to constantly remind them to bring items which we requested and they kept 'forgetting'. Service was so bad, that at one point, I took the waitress aside (Not wanting to make a scene in front of my guests) and point blank asked her, what the problem was and why we were being treated so poorly. She looked at me with a blank stare and I knew, that this wasn't going to get any better. Unfortunately, I wasn't wrong. The fact that we were treated that way, just reinforced my original thoughts about this place. Terrible service, mediocre food and rude staff. I think my son and friends finally understood, that this would be their last time too. For $24 per person, I expect much better quality food AND service. There are so many other great Sushi places around, that I highly recommend to go elsewhere and avoid this place!"}
{"text":"I agree with both previous reviews. Unfortunately for the owner (who is fab). The food is only good when he's there. And yes, unfortunately, the place is a bit grimy and 'sticky' (ughhh.. what a turn off) However, the first few times, I ordered take out and it was fresh and good. Again, I point out it was made by the owner. I went there once, excited to take my sister and owner wasn't there. The service was terrible - the waitress was more interested in reading a magazine than waiting on us or wiping down tables. Usually I'm very leary of 'all you can eat', but I thought this might be the exception. Without the owner there, i was sadly mistaken. The food suffered from mediocredity. When we told the waitress there were several bones in our black dragon roll, she could've cared less and didn't offer discount or take it off our bill (it was so bad, I didn't eat it)  .. I hope the owner sees this review - and makes some big changes - especially since he told me business was slow because he's in a McD's strip mall and his restaraunt isn't listed on the front sign. Please - go there, but ask if the owner is there before you order - otherwise - run!"}
{"text":"I felt really uncomfortable when I came to My Sushi for lunch...   Everything here are sticky: floor, tables, menus... you know how it is... that it feel Yucky to touch anything.   Lunch Specials available if you opt out for AYCE... from $7.95   Sushi Special ($8.95)  - When I found the Bento box not sparkling clean.. I just feel uncomfortable... here is one of the place I felt like that  - I finished eating my sushi and maki roll.. but I just could not bring myself to eat the salad...  - fish quality is meh... I found them not too fresh...   I don't know if I would come back here for lunch anymore...   The ambiance is quite Japanese, but with the waitress and the sushi chef talking to each other loudly in Chinese did ruin the moment...."}
{"text":"Food was fine, stuff you'd normally expect at An AYCE sushi place. The service though... Orders that never came and we waited for 20 minutes just to get the bill. It's as if they didn't want our money, and they probably won't get any more from me in the future."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout  Just sushi and sashimi combo for dinner  Fish smelled off and took them 25 mins to make it  They only had 4 customers in."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I've been here twice since I've moved into my new neighbourhood and I am in LOVE!! The service is great, the portions are filling, and the products get delivered fast to the table. This is an AYCE sushi bar which seems to be the only one near me and is worth the 2 block walk south down yonge street. I enjoy how they also take the time to explain everything to us and what is in their specialty rolls. The place itself isn't the biggest but knows how to make serving their clts # .  Will I be back??, For sure:)"}
{"text":"My sister and I were craving AYCE and this one was close by and it was $21.99 on a Sunday.  First impression, its small and dark.  The service was not very good.  We were not served any time till we asked for it.  Side note the bathroom is filthy and it was clogged and it was foul.  The quality of the food was ok, the sashimi was fresh but really small pieces.  We ordered some hand rolls and maki pieces and it was all rice.  You can tell they wanted to fill us up on rice.  For an AYCE, they really didn't want to bring another sheet to fill out when we were ready to reorder.  The service wasn't really good.  Small things make a difference - the tea should be hot, keep the bathrooms clean, leave a reorder sheet close by, cut right sized sashimi pieces.  I would go back because the quality was good, I just hope that the service gets better."}
{"text":"Came for dinner AYCE with two people. Service was non-existent and we had to flag down staff for more tea, to put in our order, and for more paper to order. We waited 30-40 minutes for the first order to be served to us. Considering that it was a total of two tables including ours at the restaurant, the wait was unacceptable. Friend wanted to leave but the food came.   Their sushi and sashimi is good at first, but later were a bit slushy in texture due to it being not defrosted enough. The specialist rolls were fried and it was not indicative anywhere on the menu.. and then they were not thoroughly fried and we could taste the batter. Ugh. For some reason we ordered some fried rice and fried chicken as well, and don't do it. Rice was soaked in canola oil and the chicken dishes tasted clearly like some microwave package.   This is a 1.5 star because the other male wait staff who served us towards the end was more attentive than the unfriendly lady wait staff we had at the beginning.   Would not come again for AYCE at all especially for $30/person. Hopefully they have better service and quality for their a la carte, but I won't be trying to find out."}
{"text":"The food was good considering the price ($19.99 Mon-Thurs).  I had nothing bad to say until I saw the slow server barely crawling to my table to deliver food with her hand in her pocket.  I am used to eating ACYE sushi with a speedy service but this one was ridiculously slow!  The food continued to come plate by plate as we settled into our small booth and I guess there was no harm in having breaks in between plates.  That was until we decided to order dessert..   We had ordered fried bananas along with our scoops of ice cream and it took them long as usual to deliver the ice cream - but when it did come, no bananas.  We called over another server (who was a little bit faster) and requested for the fried bananas again.  As we waited for the bananas, we ordered more ice cream.  The ice cream came out, but once again NO BANANAS.  Enough was enough.  We decided it was time to leave and even mentioned that we were leaving because of the slow service.  One by one we paid.  The first paid with cash, got her change and thanked them without leaving tip as she came to a conclusion that her experience there was no good.  I was the second to pay.  Debit this time. \"Would you like to include tip?\" It was a quick no!  Transaction complete.  The last person also paid with debit - and again, no tip.  Before he could hand over the machine and leave, one worker (probably the manager) noticed that neither of us paid tip and rushed over stating that there was no tip included in the transaction he just completed.  She then proceeded to ask him how much tip he wanted to add.  Of course none!  But unfortunately, being put under pressure, he regrettingly said \"$2..\".  No customer should be pressured into paying any amount of tip if they believed that the service was not worth it!  They should know that we will never be coming back.  Sincerely, UNHAPPY CUSTOMERS.  Ps. We are still waiting for our bananas!!"}
{"text":"I have gone there couple of time after their renovation. I expected improvement in their service and quality besides their redecoration as they have increased the price. Unfortunately it was not as i expected. One annoying thing in their all-you-can-eat service was that they frequently forget to bring some items (such as Sashimis) i have ordered in the menu in each round. So you have to ask them again for that which was irritating.  Overall unless you get sushi instant craving and/or urge and it is closest to place to yours, I recommend to go other place to get better experience with the similar price."}
