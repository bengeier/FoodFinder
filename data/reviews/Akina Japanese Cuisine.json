{"text":"It's an AYCE so service sucks but good food. They have lasted this long which means they're doing it right!

- salmon sashimi portion are big and fresh
- garlic sirloin cube so awesome
- Maki rolls are NOT OVER STUFFED with rice! My favorite fact!
- after 8 years, consistencey is still there

Cons
- white tuna is always frozen
- nigiri can get pretty big  while fish portion gets smaller. Order the tuna 3 separate times and you'll understand

Overall, my go to ayce sushi in Markham"}
{"text":"BEST ALL YOU CAN EAT JAPANESE BUFFET!
the fish was very fresh unlike other buffets i've tried. this place is really worth your money! they also have a different variety of foods you can try as well which are all very good! service was not too bad since i didn't go on a weekend so over all it was a great dinner experience. anytime i'm craving for sushi, i will come here!"}
{"text":"The price for lunch has gone up, now it's $12.99(pay by cash) , otherwise it's $13.99.
My favourite dishes are...
Beef ribs
spider roll
spicy seafood ramen
egg pudding -dessert

The other food we ordered are good also, like the tempura, maki and sushi."}
{"text":"I come here with my boyfriend a couple times a month. It's a decent price for an all you can eat Japanese and the menu is quite big. We don't really get any rolls and rarely get the sushi because rice fills you up very fast and their sushi has more rice than the average sushi. Like I said, the price is great and with the extra ten percent discount if you pay cash is even better.  

There are extra dishes that are not put in the menu but are available if you talk to the owners. The owners are the oldest female waitress and the man that walks around with an apron. 

Service wise is where they lose 2 stars on. The wait staff always seem moody or annoyed. If you order ten things you probably would only end up with seven. most surprisingly, even though the wait staff are young people, most of them don't speak English at all. The main language is mandarin and some Cantonese."}
{"text":"Akina is a causal Asian restaurant that offers lunch specials for $5.99 and all you can eat. 

I came here with a group of friends on a weekday afternoon. The place was calm and very casual. The d√©cor is simple and the place was generally clean including the bathroom. A big teapot of green tea was served on the table and the menu for the AYCE had a good amount of options such as sushi, hand rolls, grilled meats and seafood, udon, rice, ice cream, soda's and so much more. The way the AYCE works is that you tell your server what you want by pointing to the menu since the waitresses can't speak English.

Although I've had better, the food here is really good! My favorites have to be the spider maki, salmon teriyaki, deep fried potato pancake, grilled baby octopus, deep fried scallops, red bean ice cream and so much more. The food is fresh, cooked well, and the deep fried options are not too oily. 

The service here is horrifying as people say it is. I've never experienced service has bad as I did at Akina. The waitresses are rude, they roll they eyes at you, talk to you rudely if you order too much and wave their hands at you in annoyance when you're calling them over to the table. I'm not sure if they're trying to make the point of being rude and obnoxious, but it seems like they are. Also, half our food arrived right away and the rest we had to wait 45 minutes for it. 

Lunch AYCE: $11.99 
Dinner AYCE: Mon- Thurs $18.99 Fri- Sun $20.99
Extra charge if you pay using your credit card and you get charged if you don't finish your food. Also, 10% service charge is automatically added.

Overall, good food and horrible everything else; I would only come back here if my friends wanted me to accompany them."}
{"text":"I can hear the food snobs saying it as they read this; I should have known better than  to eat at AYCE Japanese.  Given that it's $22 a head on Sunday nights (I thought things were supposed to be cheaper in the suburbs...), and the 3.5 rating on Yelp (one of the highest for AYCE Japanese), I expected good things.  I was disappointed.

While it took a while to actually register our order, once it was in, the dishes came to our table fast and furious. Ratings:  dragon roll = bad; spicy tuna = good; sirloin beef cubes = good; cold tofu = bad; seafood fried udon = ginormous!  and very greasy  (avoid if you want to eat anything else, this is entree sized!!); surf clam = ok; shrimp tempura = ok (did they use cocktail shrimps?); chicken skewers = ok.  At the end of it, they offered their 'special desserts', which included some cappuccino-flavoured and green tea-flavoured creme brule.   Both of which were barely edible (I had the feeling they offered it to us because they were trying to clear out their fridge, it was that sketchy looking).

The selection of items was so-so, the service was ok (I think it's standard to bring the change back when you lay out cash on the receipt tray, so as not to appear presumptuous, am I right?)  and the quality was below par on average.  When a place like Sushi Island exists just a short jog from my house, it's hard to ever recommend this place."}
{"text":"We used to go this place a lot, almost every week.  Food is great but not very well presented, they just use basic dishes and sometimes with no decoration.  Their Sashimi and other raw items are usually bigger in size than other places which is a good thing.  Sometimes they forget things, but just let the waiters know and it will be right up.  This place has all you can drink.

They do charge a dollar or two for using Credit Card!  So bring some cash.
Recommended!"}
{"text":"AYCE...love it...so you can't go wrong with this place. I've gone to Akina on many many occasions and well the food will always be great but the service does suck from time to time but if you've ever been to any chinese restaurant in your life, then you are used to it! But overall, I love it there, my tummy is always left satisfied, can't go wrong with the tummy saying YES!!!"}
{"text":"This place is my go-to for AYCE, along with Sushi on 7 and Yang's Kitchen. Although the servers are a little sparse/forgetful/late (as has been noted many times in the reviews), the food is consistently good. If you like rolls (like me), you'll like this place. The rainbow roll looks amazing and tastes even better. While they might drop 10 or 15 from your order of 50 pieces of sashimi, the salmon is thick cut and fresh. Probably one of the top 5 or so AYCE places in the GTA. 

The only bad experience I had was with the white tuna sashimi, which came out a little frozen and tasteless. It hasn't happened since.

EDIT: I need to downgrade this from 4 stars to a 3. Went again recently and was disappointed to find the rolls (my favourite!) had dropped in quality.  Example: the Rainbow Roll used to be covered in 3 different types of fish (salmon, red tuna, and a white one) plus avocado to get a really nice colour. Now it's just salmon, some mango syrup stuff, and avocado. Sashimi is still good and fresh though, as were the cooked goods. The dessert options (aside from ice cream) are also really good -- try the cappucino creme brulee and DEFINITELY try the steamed egg pudding."}
{"text":"Food is tasty. Needs a renovation. Great tasty food for the price. One of the cheapest ayce but don't let the price fool you, good quality food. Only negative is the beef is always so bloody even if you ask for it well done...smh. this place is good but service can be lame at times. The Only male server in the evening is the best of them all, make sure you tip him!!"}
{"text":"This is so far, the best all you can eat sushi restaurant I've visited in the GTA. However, I must judge this place as a sushi restaurant, because that's they're primary course here.

As of now, the staff here all think I'm some kind of unfaithful philanderer, because I've visited this place about two dozen times in the last six months, and each time I've showed up with a different Woman. 
My intention was to munch on some/a lot of affordable sushi, with the Women whom I confide in on a regular basis, as ANY other modern Man would. But because of my timing, I get to wear the \"It's him again\" hat. They looked me differently now. They even check to see whether they recognize the girl I'm with before greeting us. 
I can't say I'm offended.

My advice to anyone visiting for the first time: bring all your friends, and order absolutely everything. They have some interesting dishes here, never order more than two of the same thing. There are too many goodies here for you to be confined to your regular California Roll.
It's about $25 per person, and worth the money if you got a healthy appetite. 
You will eat here the way your mama always wanted you to eat. Unless your mama is an anorexic model. No offense to anorexic models, I love you and the work you do!

The service fine, the waitresses' English aren't fluent, but the chefs are super fast on making your orders fresh.

Be sure to park close. The walk to the car after your meal will not be pleasant."}
{"text":"Considering that for an AYCE place the price for dinner (19.99)is still on the low side in comparison to current establishments I decided to give Akina an extra .5 star for my experience (plus we got 10% off 'cause they're celebrating their 8 yr anniversary!). Menu wise, they have a lot of interesting items which aren't in typical jap AYCE places , like the eel pancakes for example. Food quality wise, nothing was exceptional, but it was good enough to warrant a subsequent visit. I really liked the Akina roll, which I vaguely remember had apple/pear in it and was really unique! I also liked the teriyaki steak which was well cooked (rare) and a generous portion. In addition they are one of the few establishments that still offer all you can drink soft drinks. I was especially pleased with a particular dessert, the milk pudding, b/c it was the only one that came fresh from the steamer! To be honest when that dish didn't come, I thought they forgot and I was just going to give up on it, but lo and behold they come out with a steaming hot chinese milk pudding ='] .

Service was, it was attentive and polite. Only gripe was that our waitress kept asking us how many portions we want per item. That alone was fine, but when I gave her a number she would correct me and suggest a portion herself. It got annoying after the 5th time b/c it left me thinking, \"ok, if you clearly know how much would be enough, why do you keep asking?\" But that was a more minor irritation, and overall my experience here was still very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"AYCE joints typically don't have the greatest service in the world but here's a tip about Akina that has worked out well for us:

Come slightly earlier than their peak hours. Lunch on weekends: plan to arrive around 12:30pm. Dinners: plan to arrive around 6:30pm, 7:00pm at the latest. If you arrive during these times, the place isn't loaded hence, the waitresses tend to pay more attention to you and your precise orders are well taken care of.

It's a jungle otherwise. This, in addition to their always frozen White Tuna Sashimi is why I can only rate them 3 out of 5. The place itself could use major renovations to spruce up the appearance but it's clean so it passes.

The price is fair and the food (at least the dishes I've tried) makes my mouth water. Based on the food alone, Akina rises above Hachitarou, Yang's Kitchen, Sushi on 7 and even Nagoya (it's close though). 

Here are my Stand-Out dishes:
Sirloin Cube with Garlic (Freaking. Awesome. This dish is so flavourful!)
Deep Fried Oyster (These are crunch on the outside and so juicy on the inside.)
Salmon Sashimi (Normally thick and fresh.)
Spider Roll (Best spider roll I've tried so far. They are not shy with the soft-shell crab. An AYCE after my own heart.)
Deep Fried Oyster Roll (Delicious.)

Lastly, make sure you have enough to pay in cash because they charge an extra $1.00 PER PERSON to pay by credit or debit. If you come during jungle hours, you're in for a frustrating experience (I nearly went nuts at the counter once). Avoid the hassle. Withdraw cash ahead of time."}
{"text":"Foodwise, the place is adequate.    The hot food comes out \"hot\" and I liked the seafood and noodles soup.    Their rolls and other sushi is standard AYCE mediocre stuff....the rice was very poor.    The service was also pretty bad.   The main problem is the lack of a good system of getting the right food to the table....I thought the staff were at least trying, but the overall result was chaotic.   I don't need or like chaos when I eat."}
{"text":"My sister has just recently graduated from University, and we asked her where she would like to go for her celebration dinner.  She was craving Japanese AYCE.  She had originally suggested Ten-Ichi, but I quickly shot that suggestion down seeing as the last 2 times I went with my parents the service was lousy and they kept forgetting to bring us things we'd ordered.

My parents had never dined at Akina, so it was a new discovery for everyone in the family but me.  

Things I recommend:

Garlic Sirloin Beef Cubes - OMG, THE most flavourful thing on their menu!
Grilled Eel Pancake - Tasty, tasty!
Salmon Teriyaki - Moist and tender
Grilled Eel Maki
Spicy Tuna Maki - It is spicy indeed!  My parents didn't even dip it in their wasabi-soy sauce dish.
Soft Shell Crab Maki
Japanese Seafood Custard - Silky smooth
Egg Custard (Dessert) - Was not listed on the menu, I bet there are other items not listed on the menu.  Damit we should've asked.  The egg custard was very creamy and smooth. 
Salmon Roses

Things I won't try again:
Deep Fried Oysters - Smallest oysters I've seen.  The batter was bland, flavourless and looked like it had been fried in \"thousand year oil.\"  
None of their ice creams are good quality.  Don't waste your calories!
Ramen - bland and tasteless.  Even instant noodles taste better. 

Other things I tried and are standard:
Beef & Enoki Mushroom Roll
Shrimp Tempura - Their batter is really light
Wakame Salad
Beef Balls
Rainbow Roll

My rating of Akina has gone down due to a few factors:

They neglected to bring one item I ordered - baby octopus skewers.  

The white tuna sashimi was not thawed properly and was still partially frozen, and when it did thaw, it created a pool of water around the other sashimi.  

The salmon sashimi did not seem to stay together today. 

The salmon roses fell apart, stemming partially from the fact that they cut the salmon too thick and its hard to handle with chopsticks.

We ordered a beef ramen, and they brought us a pork ramen.

One of the girls rolled her eyes at me when I flagged her down to order dessert.  This is EXACTLY the reason why I hate the 10% automatic gratuity added to bills.

If you use VISA there is a surcharge, however, this is not posted anywhere.  

Would I eat here again, most likely yes because overall they have great food and service is usually not a strong point at AYCE sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"So far my husband and I agree that this place is not that bad. They have their good days and their bad when it comes to the sashimi. (to me at least) very simple and straight forward menu and service. Dont expect anything luxurious. so far food overall is good...place is fairly clean."}
{"text":"Use to go there for AYCE sushi but after one time when I went with some friends at night a few hours before they closed, NEVER AGAIN! 

The sashimi is either frozen, sour, or has BO! YUCK! And I got sick for a week after eating there. So that tells you how fresh the food is there. 

On top of that, the service staff yelled at us (the paying customers) because we asked for fried banana with our icecream. How can you hire...... people that treat customers like friggen garbage? 

The staff was impatient even though it was not busy, they kept rushing us to order and fully ignore the cx when they had a question about a certain maki roll. WTF is that? You can find better service and food in a landfill."}
{"text":"really nice sushi. The take out was confusing...for me and for the people there...."}
{"text":"I frequent this place on average of twice a month for their lunches. Awesome place for ayce Japanese food! Totally go there Mon to Thurs as lunch deal is 11.99 & the only thing missing from lunch menu vs din menu is Sashimi.
  
The service is less than speedy but whatever! The food is really tasty here! 

Random things I remember ordering:

Grilled Eel Pancake - A piece of eel served on top of a plain crepe, similar to Peking duck shards on that flat bread you get with it.

Grilled Eel Sushi -My favorite! The way the eel meat is & the way it was prepared reminded me of fish & Peking duck except combined!

Sashimi (Salmon, White Tuna, Saba, Red Snapper) -Favs were Saba & white tuna eaten in conjunction with each other to balance saltines. of the Saba.

Grilled Salmon Terriyaki - What can I say salmon steaks are awesome!  The skin was crispy & the salmon itself was tender. 

Beef Short Ribs - Greasy & oh so tasty.

Spider Roll - Crunchy soft shell crab in a roll with some sort of sauce, one of my favorite rolls!

10% gratuity so do not tip."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and so are the prices.  Compared to a lot of all-you-can-eat Japanese buffets, they DON'T overload their sushi with rice, which is good.  Also, their prices are pretty decent, not too expensive, especially for their lunch bento boxes.  Their service however, is not that good.  When my family and I went to eat, we had to ask for our bill three times before finally getting it.

The bottom line: I will come here again if I'm craving sushi or all-you-can -eat Japanese food despite the poor service."}
{"text":"We had the worst service at Akina. They were totally unattentive. 

Repeatedly they forgot to bring us dishes (probably because they didn't write anything down)
We had to continuously ask them for something from our order
Drinks - were not refreshed once


We got so frustrated we asked for our bill with the auto gratuity and left. 

Will never go back there"}
{"text":"Looking at all the reviews, perhaps its different coming from an American visiting Canada. Me and my friends love this place and I've came here twice already (two times out of the three I've visited). They have very fresh salmon sashimi as well as various choices of cooked food (the short ribs, steak, and salmon are my personal favorite). They are all cooked very well. As for price, I think it is very reasonable considering how much Japanese sushi can be in New York ($30-40 easily). and the bill was about $23 (?) for dinner. 

PS- when get dessert, get the mango pudding and the red bean ice cream.. They're REALLY REALLY good."}
{"text":"i went there for ayce lunch and it wasn't too great 
cooked food was okay in general but definitely not the sushi 
the rice in the sushi was almost as big as my palm
i have order 10 sushi with my friend and with that quantity of rice we would have been full just by eating one plate so we had to throw half of the rice out 
after a while the boss came and said if we don't finish the rice shes gonna charge me the regular price.
that really ridiculous i know they are trying to limit how much we eat but doesn't it defeat the purpose of ayce? 
i would \"recommend\" it if you guys are looking for eating rice but not sushi :S"}
{"text":"I've never been to Akina for their AYCE dinners, only for their WONDERFULLY priced bento box set lunches.

Their bento boxes are all set at $5.99.  They come with miso soup, salad, and 3 Cali-rolls.  The boxes themselves are large and usually have like 3-4 different things in them (i.e. Tofu, mixed veg, main course, rice).

Value wise, this has got to be one of the best lunches you can get for $5.99."}
{"text":"I'm not normally an AYCE sushi fan since my first experience at another well-known-but-must-not-be-named-establishment was very lacking. This dislike of AYCE sushi is attributed to the fact you're often charged unreasonably high prices for a meal that doesn't live up to its price tag. 
Akina however, is priced fairly ($13.99 for lunch) and I actually enjoyed the food for a change. We arrived at 11:00 and the place was empty. However, around 1:00 it started filling up. 
My group of 5 ordered about 6 rounds and got the:
 - eel maki rolls
 - baby octopus sushi
 -  Akina roll, miso soup, spring rolls, mango sushi
 - chicken & beef skewers, beef & chicken teriyaki
 - spicy seafood ramen
 - dragon & rainbow rolls, spicy salmon rolls and short ribs
Soft drinks were also part of the AYCE deal and were bottomless. However, if you are trying to eat your fill, lay off the carbonated beverages!

Standouts were the beef teriyaki which I surprisingly enjoyed more than the chicken and the short ribs. Their signature Akina roll wasn't that great as the slices of salmon were too thick for my liking, also, the rice was topped with a sweet pear concoction which I found strange. The chicken skewers were good for the first round but the second round brought very bland chicken --- it seemed that chicken cubes were just stuck on a stick and then grilled. My dining companions enjoyed the spicy seafood ramen but I hated it, I thought the noodles were under-cooked and the the accompanying soup tasted like instant ramen. 
For dessert, we sampled everything available and my personal favourite was the mango pudding which contained pieces of real mango (I hope). 
Overall, it was a good meal and well worth it as I basically rolled myself out of the restaurant. The location is inconspicuous as it's beside a supermarket and when I first drove up, didn't even see the sign which isn't very eye-catching. In addition, their waitresses only speak Cantonese so there is a communication barrier. However, the service was solid, a rare thing at AYCE places. I will return in the future!"}
{"text":"Pretty good for a AYCE! The soup selection is excellent ... I love their spicy beef soup and the fish head tofu soup.

The fish are quite fresh and the sushi tasted pretty good

I don't know how clean the restaurant is though becasue last time I went there as a little cockroach crawling on the wall...

They accept Visa and Mastercard with surcharges

P.S. They added 10% service charges on the bill already, so make sure you don't double tip them!"}
{"text":"This place offers great AYCE lunch at a very cheap cost - around 11 bucks, you can't go wrong... The Sushi and dishes alike are medicore compared to other sushi places in the area... We also feel that the selection here is not as large as other restaurants...
The cooked food is tasty and always prepared fresh.. 
The service here however is a down fall.
all in all, good sushi for a great price."}
{"text":"3/5  

its in need of a renovation thats for sure....

no frills all you can eat restaurant.

i would say this is the cheapest all you can eat place in markham.  If anyone knows of another place .. please let me know.

its 19.99 on weekdays and 21.99 on weekends... however they have a promo for 10% off if you do not want one of their specials \"lobster sashimi\" / sea urchin... etc... many of the other ayce places are offering the same promo.

food is not TOO bad... not as good as places like matsuda but worth it if you go with more people because you do save a hefty amount.  

They try to copy the mango yogurt from matsuda/sushi shizun in shot glasses.. but they put it in big cups and it taste like crap.. its not the same type of mango yogurt you think or expect.. 

they do have an awesome steamed egg milk dessert which is pretty good..."}
