{"text":"Sushi Zuki just opened, which is great since there aren't any Japanese restaurants nearby. We decided to try it out within a few days of opening and were very impressed!
The sushi was delicious, and the presentation was beautiful. I ordered the deep fried California rolls and the Chicago rolls (dynamite rolls with spicy salmon on top), which turned out to be way too much sushi for one sitting (they were 8 and 9 pieces each).
The spicy chicken yaki udon was also great, with a very flavorful sauce (served still frying in a skillet).
The bento box portions were very large, with a nice variety of items.
Overall, great food at a great price ($40+tip for dinner for 3), we will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Decor was nice and everything was decently priced. Hubby and I shared a small boat of assorted sushi and sashimi along with a tempura udon to finish the meal for $40. Fish was fine, not the best obviously for the price but decent quality. Rolls were a bit loosely packed but again, fair for the prices. Would visit again if we happen to be in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful staff. Great sushi for a good price. I would highly recommend the black dragon roll. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I have discovered this place by chance. It is great! Amazing quality and great service / price. Highly recommend the signature rolls and the hot dishes. Everything is simply delicious!!"}
{"text":"Sushi place close to home A++, clean,welcoming atmosphere - love it. Spicy salmon is great, grilled beef and kimchi also a good choice. The Unagi roll is one of my favs!! I've enjoyed everything purchased at this restaurant. And price point is also a bonus!!!! The hosts are very friendly and bubbly, also super helpful on the first visit with recommendations etc."}
{"text":"Zuki is a really modern looking and clean restaurant offering excellent and affordable Japanese sushi- a rarity in this neighborhood. I drove by a few times and decided to drop buy. The tempura excellent and not greasy or oily tasting. The sushi rolls are fresh and the wasabi tastes freshly prepared, non pungent, with the right amount of heat and flavor. I'm definitely gonna go back."}
{"text":"This place serves one of the best japanese/korean dishes in toronto. I love all the rolls over here. Service is allways friendly and quick. Also place itself is very clean and well organized. Good job guys."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious and fresh. There aren't a lot of great places in this area so I'm so glad we found this. I had the 20 piece sushi and I am very happy with the selection. I will be back and will bring guests."}
{"text":"I am thrilled about this place and wish to see more restaurants like this in our neighbourhood.  Interior is really nice, the food and service are great. The couple of times I've been in the place has been really busy. Hope they stay and do well here. look forward to dinning again soon!"}
{"text":"Good sushi at great prices! The sushi is well made and prepared with good quality ingredients. The restaurant has a cozy atmosphere and the staff are friendly, polite, and attentive. 

My only criticism is that as I have said before, the sushi is good but I wouldn't go as far as saying it's great. But with the bargain prices you're paying for, you will definitely get your moneys worth. 

If you happen to be near the Dufferin and Eglinton area and are craving sushi or simply looking for a delicious lunch without breaking the bank, I would highly recommend going to Zuki sushi."}
{"text":"Close to home?, Amazing staff? Beautiful decor? Yes I'd call it a gem as well, which means I shouldn't be writing this review because I want this place all to myself, howeverrrrrr we (I) must not be selFISH (get it) (I'm so funny I know). 
Though not an \"all you can eat\" themed restaurant, which is probably why it'll avoid flocks upon flocks of people, the prices are really good and extremely decent. The food is absolutely yummy and delicious with their own spin and some of the classics.

I got the Ocean Spicy roll and the BBQ Beef and Kimchi roll *Homer Simpson drool. 

Love love this place."}
{"text":"This is probably the best remaining Sushi Restaurant on the Eglinton strip between Keele and Avenue. The rice is tasty and warm, the fish is very fresh, and they have an excellent selection on their menu.
Limitations include poor telephone customer service - I frequently have to call multiple times to make sure my order is correct. Frequently, the people on the phone are rude and terminate the call prematurely, and when I arrive to pick up my food and pay them, the order is often late.

One last limitation, they do not make good spicy sauce. 

In summary, don't order spicy items, give them ample time to prepare your order, be patient with them on the phone, and your experience will be optimized."}
{"text":"This place was so awesome, they gave us a complimentary app, I think because it was our first time. Everything tasted super fresh and yummy. Coming back again for sure"}
{"text":"Standard sushi restaurant in the Eglinton west neighbourhood. I grabbed some dinner here with my groomsmen after suit fittings. Everything was pretty good, the staff was friendly and knowledgable about the menu. However one big issue I have with many asian restaurants is the timing of food coming out. A few friends ordered individual dishes while a few decided to share a large boat. The bring three or four hot individual dishes right away and the boat about 20 mins later. The guys tried to wait but then dove in when it stated getting cold and took so long and the second half ate afterwards. I found it really annoying that they didn't have the presence of mind to consider we would want to eat together and to time their service more appropriately. The sushi was good but Id find a place that has more consideration for the experience of their diner than just churning out dishes as fast as they can. 2.8/5"}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! The sushi is incredible for an unbelievably cheap price, and even the entrees are very filling and fresh. Everything is served perfectly, and the serving staff are very sweet! An enjoyable spot for a cheap meal, with a great atmosphere and ambiance. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Sushi here is delicious! My friend recommend it to me and there's not that many places around to eat but I love this place always make the commute to come and eat here!! Love love love"}
{"text":"We love this place for nights we do not feel like cooking. The seaweed salad is delicious, the spicy salmon roll is to die for. Portions are generous and service is very attentive. Both the sushi and sashimi are very tasty are carefully prepared. And the best of all: prices are super reasonable! Dine in or take out you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow.....new fave spot for me!!! Can't get any friendlier service that's FOR SURE!!! The food was fabulous, the service impeccable and I will DEFINITELY be back!!! Super clean, pretty spot in the middle is a somewhat run down area. Prices were VERY reasonable ....only down side is trying to get less rice on the rolls!!!"}
{"text":"Really good food and very reasonably priced. While driving home I saw this new spot and wanted to try it out. Glad I did. Delicious and nice renovations. Service is still learning - be kind."}
{"text":"The three stars are for price and food. The sashimi is good and fresh and everything is pretty cheap for the quality you get. 

We got DC01 and DC02 - 1$ extra if you want all salmon.  

Got the tempura udon, smell burnt and consisted mainly of veg and little udon.
Bulgogi donburi was pretty good.
Oshinko and cucumber roll were good, 8 pcs for 1.95. Can't go wrong with that!

CONS
The udon and the donburi are listed under Main Dishes. Which states that every main dish comes with miso soup and salad. We only got 2 salad and 1 soup. When asked where our other soup is, she said because the udon has soup already it doesn't come with miso soup .  That's the stupidest thing of life. I told her in the menu it says it comes with it. She just shrugged and said no and walked away. Okay...but whatever .  The 1 miso we got was incredibly salty! 

We got 4 water and one cup had some goopy yellow thing in it. And one had goopy thing at the bottom. 

20minute into the meal the waitresses were telling eachother they ran out of miso soup. Is this maybe why I didn't get mine...hmmm.

We got a small booth and dishes were piling up yet it took them almost till the end to come by to take them away . 

Service sucked. Would i come again? Probably. Cause I'm cheap ."}
{"text":"Excellent spot for sushi in the Eglinton West area. Haven't dined in but take out is consistently good with quick, friendly service. Great value with large portions at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I've lived in this neighbourhood for my whole life and this is the first time I have seen a sushi restaurant pre-bathurst. I must say, I am very happy about this. You can only eat Jamaican, Portuguese and Chinese food for so long before you just need to be chin deep in seaweed and sushi rolls.

The prices here are very low compared to most of the sushi places I've been to, however the quality is still great. The interior is quite appealing, compared to a lot of restaurants along e-west. Overall, at first glance we were pleased.

My friend and I got seaweed salad, miso soup, the santa monica roll, and the black dragon roll. We were satisfied with everything. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Recently visited this place again, after a great impression on my first visit. However this time around it was subpar. The sushi rice was just very wet and sticky. I ordered the spider roll, and upon eating it, you can just taste the oil that was used to fry the crab. It almost seems like the crab was prepared days ago. Also, I had the spicy salmon roll and it was a letdown. It wasn't even spicy. There was a odd tasting drizzle of spicy mayo that tasted more sweet than spicy and it barely tasted like mayo. We ordered orange juice and was served frozen canned made orange juice which was very disappointing. Overall I would not go back to this place again."}
{"text":"Love this place. Fast service, the food tastes sooo fresh. Very pretty presentation of the food. We ordered four items for two ppl and can't finish it. Service is really friendly. Definitely a place to go to have sushi!"}
{"text":"We were here on a late Tuesday night, and when we got there it wasn't very busy at all. The value is great, for approx. $16 you can get a big sushi combo and the portions are huge! All of us struggled to finish our combos. The sashimi were very thick slices and there was a variety of fish.

The restaurant started to get more busy when it was almost closing time that night. The only bad part about our experience was the looong wait time for our food."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. CHEAP prices. So worth it. 
Also they weren't on google maps so I added them! I have gone there 3 times :)"}
{"text":"Great spot, fast service, good food, and very affordable. One of the best restaurants in the neighbourhood. The restaurant is small and is almost always busy."}
{"text":"Very tasty sushi. Service was quick, which is great when you have kiddos, and they made my baby some tiny baby sushi! Too cute.  The rolls I had were very well made, and while some of the garnishing sauces were a bit on the sweet side, they more than made up for it  through the freshness of the fish. We also had some lovely tempura, very hot and extra crispy! Excellent portion sizes, great value for the money. Will stop by again if I'm in the hood!"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to Zuki.  Their sushi is definitely worth it for the price you pay (rolls are big) but when it comes to waiting for your takeout food, I don't believe 45 mins is worth the wait.  Called to order my meal and was told it would take 15 mins.  Think the restaurant is a bit short staffed but hopefully I can consider this incident a one-off."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place has 4 stars. Shouldn't have trusted that rating. Sushi didn't taste fresh, a lot of the rolls tasted the same, soups and udon had way too much salt. Do not recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been to many sushi restaurants including some high end spots with sushi that is top notch but Sushi Zuki really blew me away. Their sushi and sashimi is fresh, I ordered a deluxe combo for under $16 and got an assortment of sashimi and sushi pieces with 8 pieces of a spicy salmon roll. Believe me when I say that every single piece was delicious and the fish was fresh as it gets. Not to mention the decor inside is elegant and the service was spot on. If you're in the neighborhood check this place out, you will not be disappointed. Cheers!"}
{"text":"This is the only sushi spot in this hood that I'm aware of, and it's great! It opened very recently, and they still have some great \"grand opening\" prices.

I got a lunch bento box for about $12, with six spicy salmon rolls, six pieces of assorted sushi, miso soup, and Japanese style salad. Really cheap, so I was a bit sceptical of how the quality would be, but it was delicious and fresh.

I ordered it to go, and the server brought me a cup of green tea while I waited. Nice touch :) Great spot!"}
{"text":"Great bang for your buck plus very fresh and large portions. Excellent will have to come back for sure."}
{"text":"By far, one of my favourite places to eat in my area ! The sushi is always fresh and service is great! Very affordable, clean and welcoming environment is a bonus!"}
{"text":"I love this sushi spot, I come here a few times a month. & it tastes very good, good quality ingredients."}
{"text":"The food is so fresh and has a lot of flavour. When ever I crave sushi this is the place I go. Good price and a great menu. The place is really nice and so are the people. I'm never disappointed when I go."}
{"text":"Best sushi place ever!  Every time I walk into this restaurant I'm greeted by my name and with a smile, very friendly staff.  I always order the Golden California Roll & Crunch Roll so tasty!  Food is fresh & cheap. Zuki Sushi is a must try you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Price is reasonable, place is clean, staff is friendly.

Food was good, I found it actually cheap. I have tried most of the items on the menu and can't say there was anything wrong with anything.

The only downside is the parking and it is on a very busy street."}
{"text":"I have never been a fan of sushi until my bf told me about this new location. I always get the crunchy California rolls. I can't get enough! The prices are well priced and service is amazing. Absolutely love being greeted when I stop by! So happy it's just up the street from me. And also the decor love the ambiance here."}
{"text":"Seeing this spot open was a pleasant surprise after the only other restaurant to serve sushi in the area closed down a few weeks before (and had removed sushi from their menu earlier in the winter). The staff are very pleasant and the chefs quick. I've only ordered takeout the four or so times I've gone in, and the servers bring you a complimentary hot tea while you wait. The prices for your standard rolls are up to $1.50 cheaper than you'll find elsewhere in the city. The food has always been fresh, with my sole complaint being that the spicy salmon roll has never had the advertised tempura bits, and the spicy crab has only received them half the time.  As someone who thinks it makes a big difference in the texture and flavour of the rolls, that's something they could definitely improve upon (as well as perhaps a bit more heat in the spicy sauce), but otherwise they're a welcome addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This sushi joint is one of the few in the area which probably explains why it's always packed. We came for lunch during peak hours which was our mistake as the service was extremely slow. We were left standing by the door for a good fifteen minutes. Once finally seated, the server was incredibly apologetic and we made our orders. 
We got three different rolls, sushi pizza, seaweed salad and two miso soups. The miso soup was 95 cents, and incredibly salty. The sushi pizza was by far the best of the meal. The rice was crispy and topped generously with crab meat. The sushi rolls were well seasoned and generously priced. The spicy salmon roll was only $3.95, salmon avocado roll for $4.50 and the Philadelphia roll for $4.50. Overall, very filling meal for a great price if you don't mind the wait. Be sure you have time to spare or just come during off peak hours. They do take out/pick up orders which seem to be quite popular. Not surprising given the price point. Would come back again to satisfy sushi cravings."}
{"text":"This is so far my most favourite Sushi place in Toronto. Price is very affordable and service is  really great. Me and my friend visited the restaurant many times but food quality and service have been always the same, which is excellent! They do have other items on their menu beside Sushi and Sashimi. Location is also good, just near Eglinton ave east and Dufferin. Good for small groups since restaurant is relatively small. If you like better, bigger tables at the back for 3-4 people, it is  better to make a reservation beforehand. There are many street parking options in front of the restaurant. This restaurant also offer takeout and party platters. Try out this place soon!"}
{"text":"New to this neighbourhood and absolutely love this small restaurant ! The service hasn't been the most consistent but their food never fails. Very good quality ingredients and good pricing?"}
