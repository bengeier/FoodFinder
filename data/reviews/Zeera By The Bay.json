{"text":"Delicious!  We tried this restaurant last night for dinner.  Had their special house chicken - big, tender chunks of chicken, wonderful sauce. Great Biryani and Pakora.  The service was great - attentive without being overbearing.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Food is great.  Ok portions and good service.  Will definitely come again! Had the butter chicken and the chilli chicken. They were both delicious.  Ordered a mango salad and that was disappointing but otherwise everything, including the service was fine."}
{"text":"Fourth time ordering food here. First three times were excellent - usually order a variation of butter chicken, chicken vindaloo, chicken tikka masala, briyani, naans. I love spicy food, hotter the better, and I have a higher tolerance than most.   And each time I ordered, the server never asked how mild/medium/spicy I wanted any of the dishes. It just came out, and they all were some variation of hot & spicy, probably medium while vindaloo was a bit hotter than other dishes. Overall, they all had a nice zing.  This time, I went on Saturday for lunch. And was very disappointed.   Butter chicken was way too sweet, same with tikka masala and briyani was lacklustre. Don't get me wrong, they were tasty if you like bland Indian food, but I was looking for an explosion of flavour like my first 3 experiences. The basket of breads was very puny, and the portion sizes small. Does it matter if it's takeout or dine in?? Seems takeout portion sizes are much more generous.   When I spoke to the server, she had difficulty understanding my disappointmwnt and blamed ME for not asking for the right spicy level!! When I explained that no one asked in my previous 3 visits how I spicy I wanted the food (and they all came out wonderfully spicy), she kept on repeating to me that is MY responsibility to ask for how spicy each dish should be!! Really? So if one orders steak from any restaurant, a good server usually asks rare/medium/well done, don't they??  I asked if she was the owner, and obviously she wasn't. The server was poorly trained in customer experience and how to properly promote each dish experience. Then she said something like, well \"white folks can't handle spicy food!!\". Excuse me??? I can probably handle more spicy food than SHE can. Very presumptuous and insulting.   Is the food good? Yes it usually is.  But be warned. It seems if you go during busy evening hours, the quality of food and service is much better. But if you go during off-peak hours (like Saturday early afternoon) then the server and consistency and quality of food is not always assured.   This visit was very very disappointing, especially since I had a guest whom I've raved to about how great the food at Zeera was for weeks, and the guest made a special trip just to experience the food."}
{"text":"Service was excellent and food was amazing. Well worth the drive from Newcastle!"}
{"text":"I had never had indian food before coming here (other than samosas and curry), and I am SO glad that I chose this restaurant to introduce me to it!   Service seemed a bit slow and disorganized at first, with 2 different people asking us if we wanted anything to drink, and they took a while to take our orders after we had let both know that we were ready. Our food also took a bit of time to come out, but it was definitely worth it!  For appetizers we ordered the veggie samosas and Bhel Puri, which is described on the menu as \"A scrumptious mixture of puffed rice, peanuts, fine fried noodles, potatoes and onions blended together with tamarind sauce\". It was a VERY interesting dish, and I enjoyed both appetizers thoroughly.  For the main course, my boyfriend ordered the Tandoori chicken, and it came out sizzling on one of those hot plates! I was really impressed, and it looked really good (even though I'm a vegetarian!!). I ordered the \"Paneer Korma\" which was described as \"a ragout of cheese simmered in a rich almond and cashew sauce\", as well as naan bread and rice. It was AMAZING!   Overall, I think that the great food waay outweighs the somewhat slow service, and I would definitely go back!! I stuffed myself, but it was totally worth it! =]"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing experience. Great friendly and courteous service.the food was Fantastic, the cooks basically read our minds. Wide selections and even a page selection for our vegetarian friend. Also great for people with nut allergies. The food is so flavourful and delicious.the bread and the samosas were OUT OF THIS WORLD. Overall phenomenal service. We'll definitely be back and will definitely   recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best indian restaurants that I've been to I had heard from someone at work that it was a good place to go so I went and the butter chicken was very good and you get a couple of papadum's to start with which are really good also the chicken korma is really good and the samosas the vegetarian ones were really good also a good thing to try there is the Mango Lassi they taste very fresh and the service is very quick."}
{"text":"Overpriced for the quantity of food they serve. The waiter was in a rush and even told us ( group of 12) to decide fast as their rush hour is approaching while there was literally no one else in the restaurant other than our group . Very dissatisfied. All dishes tasted the same. They are all made with same base gravy. Kerala fish curry tasted liked butter chicken gravy with batter fried Basa pieces in it. Would never go back!!!"}
{"text":"Service! Service! Service!  This is the industry where bad service will break you. Zeera's does not have to worry about this.   I have been meaning to come here for quite some time. I went in alone as I do most of the places. Took a seat by the door and awaited a server. Avtar the owner came to greet me. He was very welcoming and friendly. I decided to try a few things from the menu. Avtar pointed out that I was ordering too much and I should stick to a couple of dishes so that I can enjoy then. I settled on the butter chicken, my all time go to favourite Indian dish. I judge every Indian restaurant on their butter chicken. I was not disappointed at all. The Kingfisher beer was a nice compliment to the meal.   The thing that really stood out during this visit was the service. Avtar asked if I minded that he sit with me. He figured that since I was eating alone, I wouldn't mind the company. Now normally, I would have declined, I actually enjoy my solitude.  We had a wonderful conversation. I felt like I was having a meal with an old friend.   I will be back very soon."}
{"text":"True flavors of Indian food. No doubt when people say best indian food in the town. Every dish has a unique flavor. I don't think I have come accross any restaurant that makes their own spices and sauces on site. Hats off to the chef and wonderful staff."}
{"text":"I think I have been to this place 4 times now since I first went in December. Delicious. Every. Time.   I never really used to like Indian food. My family is West Indian, and I always noticed how real Indian curry tasted...different. Zeera is the kind of place that can change your outlook on Indian food. It gets me every time. I usually order a veggie and paneer dish, and I always go for the naan. I am always impressed and beyond satisfied. And I applaud the guys that run the place. They are always friendly and sometimes make me laugh.  I love the cozy interior. I am looking forward to sitting out on the patio, now that it's finally warm out. I am also looking forward to the lunch buffet! It seems that when I do come here, it's dinner time and I'm forced into only stuffing myself with one dish. I'm ready to try some of everything."}
{"text":"Poor service and waited far too long for our food. When it finally came it was lacking flavour!"}
{"text":"We tried this place again because we were in the mood for Indian tonight. We have been to over 10 Indian restaurants in the GTA area so we are beginning to get a little familiar with what to expect.  Overall only minor complaints. Zeera's service was good. The food was good too. We had the Lamb Zaffrani Roganjosh, the Patiala Eggplant dish and the saffron rice dish with Naan. The lamb and the eggplant dishes were good. Not too spicy by default and if you really want it spicy, they are happy to comply.   The rice dish however was simply too small. It wasn't even enough for one person. Of all the Indian restaurants that we have been to, this was the smallest rice dish. They really should double the size and charge the same or 50 cents more. Rice is cheap, and I can't see spending $7 for two orders for two people. Just like Italian restaurants are generous with FREE bread, Indian places should be generous with rice.  The Naan was too doughy too. We have come to expect Naan to be a bit more flaky.  Otherwise we were generally happy. Our favourite Indian places are still the Richmond hill place first, followed by the Whitby place."}
{"text":"worst Indian food I have ever tried. soup looked like it had been boiling much too long in the microwave. rice was clingy and almost wet. not tasty. asked for a spoon for the soup but they didn't have takeout spoons. got metal spoon which was so dirty I wouldn't have put it in a dishwasher before rinsing it. only person I saw working there seemed annoyed I woke him  ( laying down on bench and appeared to be asleep when I walked in around 5 pm ) . had to pay cash because he didn't know how to work debit machine. won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here because I love Indian food and I trusted fellow yelpers. I'm not Indian but I loved the food here.  I tried the butter chicken and the Zeera's chicken special.  Both were flavourful, rich and had distinct tastes, which made me believe they don't just use a \"base sauce\" for all their dishes, but make every dish separate. The waiter was super friendly, which is OKAY, but I really wanted a nice quiet meal by myself, and I could tell he wanted to chat it up because it was my first time..... Decor is simple, in a good way, and prices are more than reasonable. Portions are not too big, which is a good thing. Coming back."}
{"text":"We had the meal delivered. It came very quickly and was hot and the best Indian food in Pickering.  Highly recommend it. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I don't think I will ever visit this restaurant again. We ordered the assorted platter and because we are vegetarians, we requested to replace the chicken with samosas. The samosas were way too oily and so were the pakoras. The samosas lacked flavour. We then ordered paneer (cottage cheese) chilli and paneer korma. Small portions and flavourless....the paneer chilly surprisingly had a few chickpeas in it which got me thinking about the common curry they probably used for Chana masala. The food was oily for sure. And we found hair in the food! We ordered a bread basket and the only thing that was good was the lachha paratha (flaky paratha) that was made from whole wheat and well cooked. Stay away from this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Tons of vegetarian options! Owned and run by a really nice family. Young waitress is a sweetheart. Cute little patio for outdoor dining. Great place."}
{"text":"Two words: spicy and amazing--! This place is my fix for Indian food. We usually order the chicken VindalOOOOO which keeps me sweating and my nose running because of the high spice level but it's just irresistible. Their onion naan is great! Paired with the VindalOOOOO its perfect. The interior of the restaurant is not the best! Also the samosa comes out drenched in oil so I do not recommend that but their mango kulfi is just perfect!!! The Zeera biriyani is also another reason why I love this place so much. Their recipes and use of the right spices give their items an authentic Indian taste. Great location and they have a patio as well! Strongly recommend to EVERYONEEEEE!!!!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for the past 2 years because it was the best place in town for Indian... however that's no longer the case. I think they've changed chefs in the past month or so because what we were served last night was bland. Very disappointed that we can't come back here... used to be so good. What happened?!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very small so calling ahead for dinner reservations is recommended. Had their lunch buffet today and it was pretty good. I love indian food but I feel like getting a la carte won't do it for me so I always get the buffet. It does have a small selection but for 9.99 you can't really complain. The butter chicken looked like paneer at first but it was really delicious and fresh white meat. The tandoori chicken was good but cold. I wasn't a huge fan of the lentils or saag paneer which sucks cause I really love saag paneer. The pakoras were so delicious and I had to get seconds. For dessert there was honey dew and gulab jamun and sweet rice. The gulab was yummy but a little too sweet. Not a huge fan of sweet rice and the honey dew was sweet. It was a nice experience but maybe a little over hyped. India 360 is still probably my fav buffet just cause they have a lot of options. Would still come back here. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian food I've had. Tandoori chicken, saag paneer, butter chicken, pollouri rice and garlic naan sone of our faves. Service always very friendly. Has indoor and patio seating as well as banquet facilities for large parties. Highly recommend for delicious Indian cuisine!"}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian options, relaxed, quiet ambiance and courteous service!"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food, with consistent quality. Inside is a little cramped, but the patio is nice. Weekend lunch special is a great deal, though my favorite is probably their Zeera Special Chicken dish, it's amazing. Definitely worth trying out!"}
{"text":"Family run and the customer service is amazing. The host/owner provided recommendations and altered dishes to spice (heat) preferences. The food is delicious! We had a fish dish that was incredibly delicious.  Can't remember the name. I would def go back!!"}
{"text":"Nice small place with a cozy interior.  Service was very good and the food was tasty.  Portions for an item would be good for one person."}
{"text":"Best Indian cuisine in Durham. Cute little family owned restaurant close to the Pickering waterfront on Liverpool south.   Always friendly service (usually served by mother and daughter). We have never waited more than 10 minutes for our meal.   Food is always fresh, steaming hot and very tasty! Tons of options.   Interior of restaurant is not anything fancy, however they have a cute little side patio which is nice in the summer.    Another positive note, they are happy to make minor adjustments to dishes on the menu.   Great spot. Will Continue to recommend!"}
{"text":"Good Indian food is hard to find.  So for me it was worth the drive to Pickering for Zeera By The Bay.  Overall the food is excellent, and so is the service.  You can tell these guys care about the quality of the food and the customer experience.  Unlike lesser quality places, Zeera prepares specific sauces for various dishes, rather than use a base sauce and modify the heat.  The appetizers were great (samosa's are huge!), and so were the main dishes, along with the naan bread.  Remember that Zeera serves all their food mild by default, so if you are going to order the vindaloo and like it hot, make sure to ask for it that way.  The chicken rice was the best Indian rice I have ever had, looked and tasted great, full of big chunks of chicken.  I think the only negative thing I can say is that the beef and lamb dishes don't have enough meat in them.  There was plenty in the chicken dishes.  But outside of that, if you are looking for great Indian food, this is the place."}
{"text":"Exceptional Indian food. In fact the best I've ever had. We moved into the area 2 years ago and found Zeera's in checking out the neighborhood. Before moving to Picking I lived in Toronto and Scarborough and have tried a variety of Indian restaurants nothing was as good as this.  We most often do take out so we can enjoy delicious food in the comfort of home. We have introduced so many friends to the place and they are now obsessed like us. In fact my brother in law ordered special chicken and garlic naan for 15 to have for his birthday party.   MUST TRIES  - Zeera's Special Chicken  - Daal Mukhnee - Garlic Naan   GO - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"After hearing rave reviews about Zeera, I came here for lunch the other day with a friend to see what all the hype was about. The restaurant is at the back of the plaza on the right side and faces Liverpool Road.  We were a day early for the AYCE lunch buffet which, we learned, is available Thursdays and Fridays inclusively. Nevertheless, we mulled over the menu for a few moments and with some guidance from Baldeep, picked a few tasty sounding dishes.  Our selection was:  Butter Chicken - $10.95 Madras Chicken - $10.95 Pulau Rice - $3.95  The dishes at Zeera are prepared mild and you can have the heat modified to your liking, however, since my friend is not a great fan of overly spicy food, we left the dishes as they were.  Everything was amazing. The rice was the best I've ever had in an Indian restaurant... or anywhere for that matter, and even after we'd devoured the chicken, I found myself pouring the lovely sauces onto my plate and sopping them up with my Naan! Absolutely delicious! Next time though, I'll go with my husband and we'll get a little more heat added! ;)  The customer service we received from Baldeep, who I believe is the owner - or co-owner, was fantastic. There's no doubt they take pride in the food they prepare and they certainly strive to ensure their customers have a wonderful dining experience.  I'm definitely a fan of Zeera By The Bay and look forward to coming back soon to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Very yummy Indian food!! Would I say it's authentic -- Not really. But it's really tasty, and not too spicy! The Fish Pakora is my favourite. They also offer a lunch buffet on Thursdays and Fridays which is a great chance to try some new things !"}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend so we went for a celebration dinner since we love Indian food and love discovering new places.  I was greeted pleasantly by a younger woman and shown to a 2-top table against a wall in the main traffic aisle with a great round metal piece mounted to the wall (not recommended if you should go since this is where everyone walks in or out or to deliver food and it's right next to the washrooms).  It took some time to get a pint of Cheetah dark beer (yum!), but I was not in a hurry as I waited for my husband to arrive.  The rest of the evening, the service (or non-service) is our biggest complaint.    Ordered samosas specifically with tamarind and mint chutney, since the menu only stated they were drizzled with a chutney.  Got samosas, over-cooked and brown, not golden.  There was oil on the bottom of the plate which was also a turn-off.  Served with no chutney, no napkin, cutlery or mini-plates.  An older lady came by, noticed the plates and cutlery missing, hissed at another woman to bring them to the table and went on about her business.  It took flagging down someone to finally get this settled.  The samosas were full of sliced potato but didn't have much flavour and I was disappointed in the overcooked pastry.  Would not order them again.  Read on Yelp that the tandoori fish was great.  We wanted to try a variety so we ordered the Zeera Special platter for $17.95.  It comes with tandoori chicken, garlic prawns (we only got one), chicken tikka and the fish, too.  Agree that the tandoori fish is done perfectly (moist, flakey, flavorful) and is the best thing I tried (hubby doesn't eat cooked fish).  Also ordered the Lamb Roganjosh for $12.95.  Good sauce with about 9 cubes of meat, but not enough.  Those of you who need to avoid seeds (Diverticulosis or other reasons) be advised:  we ordered the plain basmati rice and naan and both were riddled with seeds., not noted in the menu  The naan was really good.  Trying to get anything from the servers was difficult at best.  Even worse, it was rude.  The older man, who was an owner, was talking with us at our table about our desire to wrap up our food to take home and actually stopped and walked away while I was speaking to take care of men who'd walked in the door.  Another table had complained about their meal and were trying to leave as they had a 3-year old who was getting antsy.  My husband told me later that he'd had to get up and line up at the bar with this woman just to pay the bill.  It took forever, and when they ran out of paper for the cash register they made him wait while the woman went home to get more paper.  All in all, we spent quite a bit of money for not a great experience.  Worst of all, I got sick afterwards.  I can't claim it's from here.  Regardless, I associate it with this place."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place so many time & now I'm kicking myself for not stopping in earlier. This, in my opinion, is one of the best Indian food place in the Durham region.  So much to choose from but you must try their garlic naan bread and Pulao rice."}
{"text":"Zeera is pretty new and something of a hidden gem. They offer an excellent lunch buffet for $9 that has a good deal of variety, and the food is just phenomenal. On top of that they make some of the most amazing naan bread I have ever tasted. Both times I have been there the young man who runs the place has been extremely friendly and welcoming, and the food speaks for itself. They offer a full dinner menu that I will be trying out soon, for now it's my favourite lunch spot when I'm going out. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I decided to trust all the Yelp reviews and I brought myself here for lunch today.  The waiter was amazing in helping me with my food allergies and made some suggestions. He was attentative without being too hoovering.   I had the Saag Paneer, butter chicken and chick pea dumplings.   Everything was fantastic. I will be back on a Thursday or Friday for their buffet lunch."}
{"text":"I'm South Asian and I don't usually like Indian food outside. I read a lot of good reviews so I thought I would try it. The food was good, a little oily though. The desert was not too good, we had the gulab jamuns. Still the best place for Indian food in Pickering."}
{"text":"Just eat at Zeera and ordered Fish Tikka& Buttered Chicken with Pulao Rice & Naan bread...It was Yummylicious!! Will definitely go back to try other dishes :)"}
{"text":"It's been at least a couple of years since I've eaten at Zeera by the Bay. If I recall, the food was decent but the service left a lot to be desired. I decided to give them another try.  I got there around 1:30pm and I must have just missed the lunch crowd. There was only one other diner and another couple paying their bill. Most of the tables were still being cleared and I actually had to wait a couple of minutes for a table to be reset.  Their lunch buffet is offered only on Thursdays and Fridays and has a very limited selection. The steam table had only eight items, including butter chicken, tandoori chicken, fried fish, curry goat, and chickpeas. Another warmer had basmati rice and an assortment of samosas and pakora.  Unfortunately, the food items were not labeled and the serving spoons were dangerously hot to the touch. Ouch!  The food tasted good, maybe even very good. The butter chicken was a little on the sweet side but the sauce was nice and creamy. The goat was tender and well seasoned. The other dishes were also well cooked. Fresh naan was brought to my table, hot and crispy, at least the first piece was. The other two pieces were a little thicker and reminded me of pizza crust but not in a bad way.  Overall, I enjoyed the food. Other than the hot utensils, the service was much better than my last visit. My server mentioned there was a change of ownership since then. That's a good thing."}
{"text":"I like this little cozy Indian restaurant.  Have been here twice and the place is clean. The food is good.  The staff is friendly and smiley.  The only problem I had was they didn't have a baby change station in the washroom. So I had to change my many on the chair once.  Would give it a 4 star if it had it a change station."}
{"text":"I was excited to finally try out this highly praised Indian restaurant last weekend.  We were 4 adults and 1 baby and let me tell you right off the bat, this restaurant has a very small dining room (barely 600 - 700 sqft) and is not stroller friendly.  We were lucky that the restaurant wasn't busy (only 3 other parties on Sunday around 1 p.m.), otherwise we would have had to make an impromptu decision to go elsewhere where they could accommodate a stroller.    We were greeted by the only server for the whole dining room who proved too slow and inefficient to take care of the 4 tables that were there.    We ordered Tandoori mixed platter, Seehk kabob, Chicken Tikka Masala, Bhindi and eggplant dish with 2 pulao rice and 2 nans.  The slightly spicy Seekh kabob replaced our original order of lamb chops because they did not have any available. The toothsome kabobs were well seasoned and the meat tasted pleasantly of the tandoor.  The Chicken Tikka Masala and the other veg curries were just as well executed and the flavours were all very good.  Perhaps the biggest disappointment was the mixed Tandoori platter which was supposed to consist of tandoori chicken, fish tikka and tandoori shrimp for $17.95.  When this platter arrived on the same sizzling platter that hosted the Seekh kabobs, we were greeted by 3 pieces of chicken, 1 strip of fish (not sure what kind of fish it was) and 1 shrimp.  Hmm....not the best sampling platter for 4 people, is it?    As we started our meal, the tandoori platter and the kabobs were served first with no nan or the rice and we had to walk over to the kitchen to find the server to ask her to bring some out.  She quickly mentioned that she was waiting to bring out the rice with the other dishes but obliged anyways.  After a very long 2 and a half hour meal, we finished it with mango and pistachio kulfi which were flavorful without being too sweet (perhaps a little too ice-crystal-ly for me) and just an ok kir.    I have to mention that we were constantly bothered by a fly (or flies...not sure if it was the same guy or more than one) all throughout our meal which was a BIG minus for me.  Our visit to Zeera by the bay was just an ok one and if I return, it would likely be for a take out."}
{"text":"Called in and ordered take-out. I was told it would be ready in 10 minutes and it really was ready. The place is pretty small so it could get crowded fast.   Butter chicken $11.50 and garlic naan $2.50  The portions were large. There was more than enough sauce for the naan. A decent amount of chicken. Great flavours. The garlic naan was huge and fluffy with a nice doughy texture.   The meal came with a some chips as an appetizer I guess. It was pretty tasteless but dipping it into the butter chicken sauce made it more appetizing.   Very good but I have yet to find an Indian restaurant that can top Bombay Bhel.  Solid 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a second try after really poor service the first time.  Service was greatly improved this time, server was very friendly and attentive.  Decor was lacking, the place needs a redecorate.  Food was really good but I found hair in all the four dishes we ordered.  Figured the first one was mine as it was the same colour (I'm blonde) but then kept finding them, it was gross and I've never had that experience before.  I probably won't go back as now I'll always think of it as that \"hair\" place"}
{"text":"Zeera is a great Indian restaurant in Pickering. The choices of this type of cuisine is limited in the area but so I not only like that it offers what is missing but also that it delivers quality food. The location is pleasant and cosy though it's located in an unassuming plaza. I would recommend the butter chicken naan and rice. The fish tandoori is also wonderful."}
{"text":"I never would of known of this place if it wasn't for the YELP family. Being of indian decent, I have tried probably all of the indian restaurants in the Pickering/Ajax area. But this place, by far,  is the best!   My first impression of this place was that it wasn't very big, the decor wasn't up to snuff. Nevertheless, it was a very comfortable atmosphere.  We were promptly greeted by Baldeep, who is part owner of this place. He was very courteous, and quite helpful when it came to the menu.  All the food we ordered was very good, but what really stood out for me was the Fish Tikka! If you like fish, you have to order this item. Its sea bass, marinated in indian spices, then grilled over charcoal...sooo GOOD! The party I was with, was vegetarian, and they said the veggie food was very tasty as well.  We had a plesant conversation with the owner and found out the chef is from a 5 star hotel back in India, based on how tasty the food was I wasn't surprised.  We intend on going back in the summer, when the patio is open. A must try for indian food lovers."}
{"text":"Very flavorful food. As good as any I have had in the metro area, or during my last trip to Bangalore.  Very good prices. Yes it is a small place, but that just means you should plan ahead so you don't miss anything. Call ahead if you are worried. We had good service and no issuea with flies or anything questionable in any way as noted in another review. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I honestly like the food here but the only reason why I am giving it 3 stars is because, yesterday when I went to dine in and eat.. the service was good and all but the Butter Chicken!! It was very tasty, don't get me wrong.. It's just that it was waaayyy to creamy.. and I adore creamy, believe me but I felt really 'heavy' after eating it.. Compared to when I eat butter chicken at other Indian restaurants. Would I order from them again? Absolutely.. but I would have to be in the mood for a real heavy Indian meal. The naan was good, the chicken biryani was goon, the lamb shaash (I think that's what it's called).. Was really good it was in a green minty seasoning sauce, I enjoyed it a lot. Since I live closer to the Bombay Grill $10 dollar all you can eat lunch, can't go wrong.. So I guess I will stick with them and only order from here when I am in the mood for some 'Heavy Indian' food. The customer service was a 5 out of 5. Food 3 out of 5. I still enjoyed it though.. I think they should put a little bit less in the cream (Your hearing this from a human who LOVES Extra cream btw.. They just over did it here..). But good otherwise :)"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a GREAT Indian Restaurant in this area...STOP!  You have arrived. Four of us ate here, half of us vegans.  We had the grilled sea bass, lamb curry, egg plant. Outstanding! Service was excellent and the price was more than reasonable. Go here!"}
{"text":"Cons: A very run down exterior, without parking and looking around easily missed. Interior simple and a bit worn down. If restaurant is busy the buffet trays will be empty. Place was empty (just opened) when I arrived but the host wanted to seat me in the darkest corner, and when I asked for a window seat, he was unhappy that I requested it.  Pros: Nice clean, coherent indian buffet. Food was delicious. Tandoori chicken and fish pieces stand out. Butter chicken, and paneer was good. Beef was good too.  Will be back, as it's worth another visit to see if the first visit was a fluke."}
{"text":"And so here we are. My third visit under my belt. Normally it would take a few more visits to come to this conclusion but today was the day.  I have had Chili Paneer, Channa Masala, and Saag Paneer (sorry for misspelled words) and each of them were delicately put together and uniquely flavored. Each entry was well portioned, and i ordered each with a side of Naan....   I have spoken to a few of the staff there now; very charming family of people. They are very inviting and nurturing folks and this reflects in the decor of their restaurant as well; very inviting place to sit and enjoy lunch; especially out on the patio!   Indian food is a staple in my diet so i am pleased to say the newly discovered Zeera by the Bay is a WIN for me!!  Thank You"}
{"text":"Craving some good indian food I was soo excited to finally try this place out! We arrived just before 6pm on a Saturday night and the restaurant was pretty full. Mind you there is probably less than 30 seats so reservations are a must. Luckily the hostess offered to seat us in the connecting party room since they weren't having any private functions tonight. We ended up being the only people eating in this room however I didn't mind it all.  After perusing the menu we knew exactly what we wanted. The waitress was very good in explaining dishes and answering our questions about varying dishes. After placing our order we were brought over some freshly deep fried crispy papadums to nibble on as we awaited our feast.  Onto to the food:  Channa - Chickpeas slowly simmered with tart pomegranate seeds, chopped shallots, tomatoes, and spices I loved the creamy curry the tender chickpeas were in, really amazing balance of spicy sweet and tart!  Aloo Gobi Mutter - Cauliflower simmered in a delicious masala of poppy, cloves, and fennel with fresh peas and potatoes My all time favourite indian dish! They definitely knocked it out of the park! Perfectly cooked cauliflower still with a little bit of bite and wonderfully spiced.  Pulao Rice - Long grain basmati rice cooked with pure saffron and a touch of spice  Some of the best pulao I've had so fragrant and aromatic  Garlic Naan - OMG soo good and addictive, nicely charred and crisp exterior enclosing a soft tender chewy bread coated in fresh garlic butter soo perfect for mopping up all the curry  I have to admit Zeera definitely serves up some of the best Indian food i've ever had! Service was really good, despite being in a different room away from all the other patrons we were never neglected. Water was refilled continuously through the meal and the waiter came by to check on us and make sure everything was ok. Food was served in good portions - the two of us were super stuffed after the meal! Food was not only delicious, full of flavour and great spiced but also plating was beautifully done silver and gold bowls. I will definitely be returning to Zeera to try out some more amazing dishes!"}
