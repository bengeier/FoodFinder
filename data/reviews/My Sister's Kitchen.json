{"text":"My sisters kitchen is tucked away near downtown Middleton. We were seated right away around 9:30 on a Saturday morning. Seating is limited but they do a good job of turning tables. At our table we ordered the breakfast burrito, eggs Benedict, and pancakes. The food was good and portions were big. They were even able to make a small pancake for our two year old. The staff was friendly, and the smiles and laughter were contagious. The one small issue is that they do not accept credit/debit cards, so make sure you bring cash or checks."}
{"text":"Great, kichty little spot that was perfect for our Saturday breakfast with sisters. Great food and staff! When we walked in, one of the wait staff chased a takeout customer across the road and down the street because he overpaid by $10. Then, when we left, my son left a hotwheel and a different staff chased us down the block to return it!  Go there for food and atmosphere or just because good people work there!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast/lunch place that feels like small-town Wisconsin. Wife raved over eggs benedict, and portions are hearty with good hash browns. Only drawback would be that it's a bit small in size, so there can be waits. But worth the visit if you have time"}
{"text":"The food here was incredible and the prices reasonable. The wait staff was very friendly. It's a quaint restaurant on the streets of Middleton. We had the scramble and the two two two. Will be back tomorrow"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this diner. Walk in and step back in time. The food is good and plentiful, the price very reasonable and the staff is full of personality. Cash only but they do have an ATM on site. If your up for old fashioned family cooking, come here"}
{"text":"I had The Big Sister (eggs benedict). Fantastic. Not only did it taste good but it was also presented well. There was no nasty puddle of grease at the bottom of the plate when I was finished. Neither did anyone else's plate. We all enjoyed our breakfast. The restaurant is small but we were seated pretty quickly. The wait staff was very friendly. I'll definitely be back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on a Sunday morning around 9am and the waited to be seated like 10 min.   The staff was very inviting and polite once we were seated.   The only problem is we waited like 40 min to get our food after we ordered.  The food was delicious after it finally arrived.  So be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little mom 'n pop breakfast house. Great breakfast, fun little place, excellent service."}
{"text":"We've only eaten Breakfast here and it's delicious every time.  The staff if fantastic and extremely friendly.  Prices are reasonable for quantity.  Omelet meal $9 and French toast $6.25 (see pictures)  We will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Great food; don't forget your cash! Parking is limited; but the food will remind you of home! Will definitely stop the next time we stay on west side of Madison!"}
{"text":"Yelp did not let us down and neither did the Sisters. Breakfast was perfect from the expertly grilled hashbrowns to the face-sized cinnamon roll! So much nicer to eat at and support a local place than a franchise."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! We had the cowboy steak so juicy and tender melts in your mouth. The country potatoes were the best we've ever had.  Such a cute small cafe with an Americana feel."}
{"text":"This is a great little place to get breakfast.  I had a few appointments in Madison and was looking for a place to stop and get something to eat between them.  Really good homemade food and helpful friendly service.  I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu.  The portions were your normal \"Wisconsin size\" and came out hot.  I also took home a slice of banana cream pie.  The slice was about 1/4 of the pie!!    Not sure what happened with some of the other reviews here, but I did not have any service issues."}
{"text":"So I will start by saying this is my first review and I read the others posted. This is a cute little place to have a laid back breakfast. Now what I mean by laid back is you better have a couple of hours for breakfast. Nice waitress but we waited over an hour for our food. That being said I had the corned beef hash and it was good but no where near worth the wait. The coffee stunk as well. I would pass"}
{"text":"This used to be known as Three Sisters.  This is a great place to go for a good, cheap breakfast that will fill you up.  You seat yourself, but the staff is still at your table taking your drink orders quickly.  The staff is always super friendly and all of the breakfast items I've tried have been great.  Even better, they keep your coffee filled even when it's busy! :-)  Only thing to know ahead of time is they only accept cash and there is no atm in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Ate here this morning with my daughter Victoria ordered biscuit and gravy and country scrambler with cheddar cheese and wheat toast. My daughter also ordered a side of hash browns.  We ordered two meals so we could try out the menu. The country scrambler was AMAZING!!!  The biscuit and gravy just so so. A little too salty for my taste. I will happily eat here again but will pass on the gravy.  Staff seated us right away and food quickly came out from the kitchen. Well done My Sisters Kitchen."}
{"text":"A friendly, basic place for a decent meal.  Obviously has a clientele of regulars.  Food is just fair, as is the industrial coffee.  Nothing special, nothing really bad.  Some of the regulars seem to think they are part of the decor, and not in a good way.  Should be cheaper IMO for what you get."}
{"text":"Overall, great food and service.   I had omelet w/ hash-brown and coffee. The omelet was covered with thin egg, which I loved. Thing I liked most was the fresh coffee. They normally have burn taste in such kind of brunch restaurants because they put the pot on the heater forever. Also our server was very friendly and helpful.   Oh, it's cash/check only."}
{"text":"Been here two times now..fantastic. Food, service and coffee are awesome. Their pancakes are as big as your face! Hash browns are cooked perfectly. Buttery in the middle, yet crispy on the outside. Eggs are always cooked perfectly. LOVE.   Fyi..VERY limited parking and seating. Their lot maybe has 8-10 spots and there are around 13-15 tables. We always park across the way on the street."}
{"text":"This is a great local spot to grab breakfast. Simple set up with very good food. The service was just what you would expect. When a breakfast spot has regulars like I saw you know the good food is consistent.   I would even return knowing it is a cash only establishment. Usually I rack up reward points on my dining, so it says something about the simple but tasty food.   They met my high expectations, I can certainly recommend a visit."}
{"text":"What a gem for breakfast! Wonderful service, fantastic food. Got the southwestern. The salsa is great. Would recommend getting that on eggs as well. Great spot."}
{"text":"Tried my sisters kitchen for the first time today.  Immediate impression- the breakfast version of a dive bar.  This place really needs to be shut down for a few days and completely cleaned from top to bottom.  The food is really GOOD though- only if you're not allergic to butter, and also butter.  Not quite enough to make me overlook the scene inside.  I don't think I'd go back unless the hose down occurred."}
{"text":"A refreshing new take on an old standby.  My sister's kitchen has great service, good prices and excellent breakfast and lunch.  Tip: Go on Thursday and try out the Texas Tortilla soup. Lesson learned was this establishment is CASH only. This reminded me of Cheers as all the girls knew most of the customers by name."}
{"text":"They close at 2pm, and we made it just in time for lunch. They're a greasy spoon, serving just breakfast and lunch.  I had a half order of the eggs benedict (Little Sister) with American fries. I enjoyed my eggs benedict - the egg was well poached, but I wish the hollandaise was a smidge more tart. The American fries weren't the thin fries, but small sliced potatoes and fried in some oil (like home fries). I ate all of it, but they were much greasier than I would've preferred for a weekday lunch.   The place isn't huge, and it's easy to miss from the outside. We sat in a booth, and the service was fast and friendly. They are cash only. I'd come back if I'm in the area. Everything is well priced."}
{"text":"Solid little breakfast joint.  Not fancy, but the portions are large.  Seating is limited."}
{"text":"Always on the lookout for family-owned restaurants, my wife and I happened to be in the area and stopped in for breakfast.  We learned that two sisters purchased this restaurant from another owner 3 years ago and have enjoyed running it since.  As other Yelpers have acknowledged, this establishment is cozy, not cramped.  What it may lack in size more than makes up for with its generous portions and homestyle flavor.  It is the epitome of Americana cuisine being that it is a greasy spoon, but everything is oh-so-yummy.  My wife had their breakfast sandwich with sausage.  The sausage patty was not your garden-variety, frozen, flat discs retrieved from some box found in frozen foods section of your favorite grocer.  These things were about an inch thick, and more closely resembled the meat one would find on a serious burger.  I had the country omelet with country potatoes.  There was plenty of meat and veggies in the omelet, which was sizeable and tasted just fine.  But the star of the show was the potatoes.  They appeared to be sliced thin, presumably using a mandolin and fried on the grill top.  These things were seasoned perfectly and ultra-dangerous in a very good way.  Again, they did not skimp, which made it easy to share, to my wife's delight.  The counter where we sat featured brand new super-comfy stools.  There were plenty of booths and tables in the dining area to accommodate small or large parties.  The restaurant was near capacity when we arrived, and the noise level was low enough to carry a reasonable conversation without the need to speak loudly.  The service was outstanding.  We never saw the bottom of our coffee mugs.  One of the sisters saw to it to ensure all coffee cups stayed hot and fresh.  They stayed on the move but always spared time for a brief chat with their customers.  With the sisters always smiling and laughing, It amplified the warm, homey buzz we enjoyed during breakfast.  It's cash or personal check only - no credit cards.  Their prices are incredibly reasonable.  To put it into perspective, they had a stand-up see-through refrigerator filled with slices of pie.  At the time of our visit, they served individual slices of homemade double-layer lemon and banana custard creme pies.  The slices were huge, yet they only charged $3 a slice.  If I were 20 years younger, I might give Dean Winchester (\"Supernatural\") a run for his money.  This is one of those diamond in the rough places that folks like me seek out, and, after initially reveling in their greatness, revisit on a whim when the mood strikes."}
{"text":"This place is always crowded, and with good reason. It's a great neighborhood joint with good food and a friendly staff that get to know you.  It's my favorite breakfast joint in Middleton (well, it's a tie with Bloom in the summer when Bloom has outdoor seating). You can't beat the prices, either.  Be ready to wait a few minutes for a table to open up, and bring cash (don't worry--they have an ATM if you didn't). The cash thing is the only reason I give them 4 stars instead of 5.  Also, the tables and booths are old and tired. If you're a snob about these things, spare yourself and them the trouble. You come here for the food, the service, and the old-timey diner atmosphere.   Parking in the lot is annoying. The lot is tiny. Ain't no thang for me - I just walk. :)  There's plenty of on-street parking for those who don't have that option."}
{"text":"Overall not impressed. It was dirty, really needs a good cleaning especially behind the counter on the floors and where the stools are. Food was way over priced for the quality. A glass of juice is 2.75, one glass pays for the entire crappy brand. I would recommend Denny's for a better quality. It's a restaurant you would see on kitchen nightmares!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a nearby breakfast spot and My Sister's Kitchen fit the bill!   I have passed this place many times, but never paid it much attention. It was really packed when we arrived on a Sunday morning, not surprising. We had to wait in the main area until a party left, it was that crowded.  Friendly service and a solid Eggs Benedict for a typical breakfast price. Worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Huge, delicious servings; service is always with a smile and the best homemade desserts! I wish they were open later on Sunday."}
{"text":"Food was tasty and portions were generous.  The service friendly and good.  The dining room was freezing on the 20-degree day we visited.  Nothing glamorous or fancy here but a good meal at a fair price.  I'll go again...but not unless it's at least 40 degrees or so outside."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. Great atmosphere, food, and service. We will be back. The French toast was great and the pancakes are the size of your plate!"}
{"text":"Had the French toast with side of bacon. French toast was mediocre, bacon was greasy and a little fatty. My husband had basic eggs, sausage and toast.  He described his meal as \"okay.\"  Nice, local  feel. Friendly staff, interior is plain, dated, a little bit cramped.   Bratty, whining children and rude people conversing on phone kill the atmosphere."}
{"text":"My Sister's Kitchen is like the new and improved Three Sisters.  They've renovated the inside so it is much brighter, cleaner, and nicer than it was before, but it is still a 100% old-school, cash-only, traditional American diner-type of place.  Pancakes still the size of your plate, coffee as you expect at a diner (fast and refilled quick).  Totally nice people running the place."}
{"text":"This place is quaint. It's like one of those old-timey Mom & Pop diners you'd find just on the outskirts of town. When I walked in, everyone greeted me like I'd been coming here for years --- despite it being my first visit. (I felt like Norm on \"Cheers\".) The menu is your standard fare. Nothing too fancy or decadent. But I asked for an Mexican egg white omelet and everything came out perfectly. The crowd is also your standard fare of retirees and veterans who like to gossip over eggs over easy. All in all, a nice respite from my hectic morning. Be advised -- they have like three parking spaces total -- so prepare to park on the street."}
{"text":"Been here many times for breakfast when it was Three Sisters. It's a greasy spoon, neighborhood joint that makes a competent pancake along with some egg dishes.   Now under new name but believe same owners - we return on a Sunday morning.  Menu had changed from our last visit.  Waitress comes over and asks if we're ready.  I pose a simple, polite question:  Are the sandwiches and salads (the whole right side of the menu) also available?  I had a vague recollection when it was Three Sisters that these were NOT available on the weekends.  Her response was loud, rude and inappropriate.  No! she yelled.  Salads and sandwiches are NOT available on the weekends!  She said this so loudly and with so much irritation in her intentionally robotic voice it was absurd.  Others in the room just sat staring.  It was so egregious I felt the need to say on an equal decibel level \"Ok, ok, I get it!  You have been asked this before and it annoys you.  You're coming through really loud and clear! Enough.\"  A simple sticker on your 1974 menu with six words would correct what appears to be a serious hot button issue for you:  \"This page not available on weekends.\"  Who goes out to breakfast on a Sunday morning to be spoken to like that?  Worse yet, one of the \"sisters\" was sitting at a table across from us with a friend.  The friend was enjoying a sandwich.  Really???? Where the hell is Larry David when you need him?    Name should be My Rude Sisters Kitchens. And btw - why do your omelets have that strange sheen on them?  Oh right, its all that grotesque, unnecessary oil.  We won't be back, rude little sisters."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident & glad we did! Food was simple & amazing.  Great service & a cute little atmosphere.  I had the veggie scramble with toast.  Hash browns were crispy & not greasy.   Will definitely be back if in town again."}
{"text":"This family run business was a pleasant surprise. It is cozy but not cramped. Well made and homemade breakfast classics. All the staff was very accommodating and welcoming. Family friendly & worth a wait, if there is one.  Country Omelette and pancakes (HUGE) were fantastic.  Truly regret not trying their corned beef hash. Heard good things. We shall return!"}
{"text":"I've been eager to try this place for ages, and it's exactly what I hoped it would be in the flood of Madison area hip restaurants.  This is very small town diner, the kind you find on Main Street USA, with old booths, a small counter, and locals drinking coffee and reading the paper. Perfect for a comforting breakfast! I had this idea to try the biscuits and gravy, but my stomach wanted eggs and toast. Not willing to go boring, I went with the southwestern eggs and hashbrowns. It was good. Fresh peppers in the otherwise standard hashbrowns. Fluffy scrambled eggs. Coffee is decent, better than most diner coffee. And it was great, charming service.  This is the kind of place where it seems part homemade and part Sysco standards, but I can't say for sure. Looking forward to the Bs&Gs some day!"}
{"text":"Best place for a laid back breakfast!  The food is wonderful and the Sisters remind you what is comfortable about \"Comfort Food\".  You can get about anything you could ever imagine eating for breakfast.  Coffee flows freely as does the conversation with the staff.  The wait staff is excellent. Always fun to be there. Friendly and knowledgable team."}
{"text":"If you are able to stop at this breakfast gem,  do it.  We had 5 different orders,  and all were fantastic.  I had the Eggs Benedict, and WOW. Absolutely amazing.  Portions are ginormous, and super kid friendly. The Southwestern was enough for 2 people,  but my husband lived it so much he finished them on his own."}
{"text":"Was in Middleton on business and stumbled upon this magnificent gem.  Fantastic food, great community atmosphere, friendly, family oriented.  Cannot recommed this place more highly for breakfast."}
{"text":"An overnight out-of-state guest of mine actually went here before me, and had a good experience, so I had to try it for myself.       Went on a Tuesday morning hoping for a 'no wait' breakfast. By the looks of the small and full parking lot, I assumed this was just a fleeting dream. But, luckily a couple parties were just leaving as we entered.       So we barely edged ahead of another couple and snagged a booth! Yeah baby! But our joy was quickly crushed by our server, as she inappropriately and rudely pointed out that we shouldn't have sat in a booth that hadn't been wiped down. So. Rude.        My hubby actually wanted to leave right there and then, but I convinced him to turn the other cheek.... I think she sensed our horror and went out of her way to be nice and attentive the rest of our meal. :)       In reading past reviews, I was convinced to try their Corned Beef Hash. And true to past reviews it DID NOT disappoint! At first when the server brought it I was almost certain she'd brought me the wrong plate. I was wrong.       At first glance and my plate looked like a giant, crispy hash brown dome of goodness. Period.  But a quick lift of the taters revealed the steamy, tender corned beef cubes with grilled onions underneath.       Is this how Corned Beef Hash is supposed to be? I DO believe so. It was so delicious and huge, I took half home to enjoy the next day.  Second day was just as delicious!       My obervations at the diner tell me it's a true hometown kind of place where most patrons are greeted by their first name.  And the server asks them if they want \"their usual.\"      My \"usual\" would have to be CORNED BEEF HASH."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. I took my 2 yr old there and there was a short wait for a table. The employees brought him Crayons coloring books and toys. I had a bacon cheddar omelette with tomato hash browns and wheat toast. My baby had a short stack buttermilk Pancake. The breakfast was amazing"}
