{"text":"Came here for dinner and left full, but not satisfied. This place had most of the hotpot selections, however, the soup base was very meh... overall this is a very, very average hot pot place. Not worth your time."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.0/5.0  Another hotpot place opened up which replaced Lychee Bay. Pretty much your standard selection and quality - nothing really special to point out other than their unusual option of having a cartoon animal made of beef fat sitting in your soup base. I am sure some of you saw this on BlogTO. It was sold out already at the time which seemed quite early considering I got there at around 6:30 PM. I believe there is a choice of either a Hello Kitty or a Doraemon.   We chose the two flavour soup base which was about $13~ in addition to $26~ per person on weekends. It came up to about $40 per person after taxes and tips. In terms of the meat selection, the beef was a bit cheap in quality but the lamb was decent - not really gamey. The shrimps were quite big and the pork neck was also another good option. Also a nice selection of vegetables and they tasted fresh.  Ordering was quite easy with access to an iPad menu. There were several occasions where some of the items we ordered did not show up so you end up having to reorder your items which was quite annoying.  Note - There was quite a long queue after 7 PM where the average wait time was 30 minutes. You can book a table ahead of time if you have a group of at least 4 ppl."}
{"text":"Came here with friends last Saturday night around 10pm and the place was empty. I guess that in itself says how popular(or not) this place is.  There really wasn't anything that stood out about this place. The meat served was fresh but sliced paper-thin.   In short, it'll serve its purpose if all you want to do is fill up on food."}
{"text":"I give 5 starts because I am the one who can eat the very spicy food?the style of this restaurant is  Sichuan cuisine????), that means the \"spicy culture\".  if you are not the one who accept that culture, this restaurant is not recommence to you: if you are, then congratulation, that is your best choice!  The super spicy hot pop soup make the meat, meat boll or other hot pop cooking material taste more soft and appetizing, even though you don't need any addition sauce for the hot pop. That is the real hot pop, the hot pop soup come with the hot pop material makes the taste better than adding any sauce!  The dessert also really good for taste, if you love the Chinese food, taste soft, delicious and savoury?"}
{"text":"Of the hot pot genre, this is one of the best choices.   Recently renovated, so it's clean and slick looking. Love the ipad system of ordering.  The quality of ingredients is awesome, the spicy broths are insanely spicy tho.   I recommend getting the watermelon drink to help with the spice.   For the price and quality it would be hard to find better."}
{"text":"I had the spicy broth - No flavour. Medium hot wasn't spicy at all. Also we were seated right at the entrance where hoards of people stood right at our table and watched us eat for the entire duration. They don't give you any beverage, they don't even ask if you'd like water, unless you manage to grab one of them to ask, because they clearly want you to buy their overpriced, watered down drinks. I've been here twice and both times they've missed a number of my orders (this place is all you can eat and they're trying to give you less food). We had elders who are clearly seniors but they won't give you the senior rate unless you manage to grab them and ask. Dishonest vibes all around. Customer service is lacking in general. There are many better hot pot places in town."}

{"text":"Came here solely because I wanted to see the hello kitty/teddy bear shaped frozen beef fat in my Chinese hot pot. I was of course very disappointed when I was told that the cartoon beef fat is usually reserved for dinner patrons and that I should call ahead to book it as there are only limited quantities. I have a feeling they only offer it during dinner since they charge more per person at night. Nonetheless we had settled into our chairs and decided to try out the place to see if it was worth it to come back a second time for the cartoon shaped beef fat. I would say I was quite satisfied with the quality of the food and the selection. The hot pot is all you can eat, and you can choose between one, two, or three soup bases, but with additional charge per extra soup base. We went with the pork bone and spicy soup base with the lowest spicy level and holy smokes it was SPICY. They also have a sauce station with a whole lot of sauces to mix your own.  By the sauce station there are also some small dishes and fruit. I would definitely come back mainly for the cartoon shaped beef fat, but if without that, I wouldn't really go out of my way to come here. The service was mediocre and the food is about the same as other Chinese hot pot places at the same price point."}
{"text":"Visited this place after seeing it on blogto. Purposely drove here to just order the cartoon fat hotpot soup base.   Upon arrive we found out that the cartoon fat is only for the spicy soup base and that soup base is apparently \"too spicy for white people and CBC's\" before we even ordered. This was kinda rude. I even asked him if I can just get the cartoon characters and put it in the clear soup base instead. He said o.   In the end we just ordered a clear soup base. Sauces are located at the front and self served. The beef here was pretty good. It was really thin but also pretty soft. The beef balls , fish balls, lobster balls were all average nothing special. The vegetables were fresh though. I also order some type of deep fried meat. The meat tasted dry and stale. It seem overcooked or recooked or rewarm. It was not hot at all. Not fresh.   As for dessert we ordered the deep fried bun. It was really oily. Would not recommend.  But overall the service here was pretty bad. The waiter seemed like he didn't want to be there. The meat was ok. But there was not much that I liked on the menu. Would not recommend. You can find another hotpot place for the same price."}
{"text":"Came here after seeing the BlogTO post. I called before hand to reserve one of their 3D beef fat soup base. (Highly recommend to call before hand to reserve)   They have a nice selection of food and they're also one of the few place that doesn't charge extra for seafood, of course their prices are a bit higher but we went on a weekend so it was expected.   Their services as great, I didn't have to called a server to refill my pot and we went in during dinner rush. We did had to reorder some of the food that never made it but I haven't been to a place that we didn't have to reorder food when ordering on an iPad.   The only downfall was that not only did we have a bit of trouble speaking to the servers (communication barrier) because they were all mandarin speakers (I'm Cantonese and my boyfriend is French ._.) but their menu on the ipad was still 50% in Chinese even after changing to English setting (that's not a problem for me but it was a bit annoying to translate over 50% of the drinks section to my boyfriend cause there was no pictures of the drink)."}
{"text":"Wanted to check this place out because of the BlogTO video and how the soup bases came with the animal fat cartoon figures. Unfortunately we did not know that this costed $16-18 depending on whether you got 1 or 2 soup based which I think is unreasonable. Otherwise the food was typical hotpot food style (although they did have frog legs which is pretty cool) and the service was not extraordinary either. Would not go back"}
