{"text":"Ordered the beef noodle soup. Was very flavourful and comes with unlimited rice noodles. Would like to add there was no washroom here... You could ask for wet napkins if you want something to wipe your hands. And no AC and the food is hot, so was sweating the entire time."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best rice noodles in town. Everything tastes legit.  Price is decent, it is similar to all other rice noodle places in Toronto. They even offer more side dishes than most of them. The steamer chicken with chilli sauce is a must try! Be careful when you order anything spicy on the menu."}
{"text":"Brand new place opened up across from my condo. Had to check it out. Was disappointed.  I have Chinese roots but grew up in Canada. So maybe I'm not familiar enough with this style of noodles. I'm not seeing the point of serving you the ingredients in separate bowls for you to put in. I don't see how different it would be if the kitchen staff just put in the ingredients themselves and bring out the whole thing in one bowl.   Anyways, I had the original and my gf had the beef brisket. I love Chinese hand pulled noodles. The texture is so smooth. I also love Japanese ramen for its rich broth. If I compare with these 2 styles, both the noodles and the broth at Golden Rice Noodles are lacking. The broth is light and feels like something I can make at home with chicken broth cubes. The noodles are nothing special either.   The amount of meat is also really small. For $10.99 plus tax and tip, I'm not seeing the value. So this place is a fail on multiple fronts in my book. But...it does get quite a few customers. So maybe it's just not my cup of tea. You can get a small discount at Presotea next door if you eat here. But I'd rather go up North just a little bit and spend my money on Magic Noodle or Kinton Ramen."}
{"text":"Great spot for noodle soup! I had their takeout of the braised beef noodle. All the toppings were already added in and the noodles were in a separate container. The broth was delicious! Definitely coming again, hope to eat in next time"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service. We were a party of 5. The Lady sucked her teeth at us when I asked for water for the table... then sucked her teeth at us because it was too much work to split our bill for a party of 5. She didn't tell us they don't accept credit card if it's not over $20... so we asked to put two of the bills together because we only had credit card.... she gave us so much attitude saying don't ever do that again next time.... I told her there won't be a next time. My friends and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I came here with my bf for a late dinner after a long day of shopping lol.   We ordered shredded potato and the cucumber dish to share and I ordered the beef brisket soup for myself.   Our side dishes came out pretty quick. And we both didn't like the shredded potato. It was really spicy for me and the seasoning wasn't good and it had a very oily taste to it. The cucumbers was okay. The beef brisket had a good amount of meat in it and the broth was flavourful.   Overall it was a good meal. If I was in the area craving noodles I would come here again, otherwise I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Great noodle spot!   I ordered the original soup with a side order of short ribs. Which were not short ribs but instead we got braised pork bone shoulder. I was disappointed that it wasn't what I thought it was but it's worth a try.   The only catch it's that there is no washroom.   The service was nice."}
{"text":"This restaurant is decent if you're looking to have rice noodles in North York, but I think there are much better options elsewhere.  We have a go-to rice noodle restaurant in Scarborough, but spotted this restaurant on our way home and decided to give it a try.   The menu didn't have as many options as we were used to. My mom and I ended up ordering the original with seafood, while my dad got the beef with seafood. There seemed to a be fewer side dishes than other rice noodle places, but the noodles were decent. Prices were also slightly higher, which is expected in such a busy area.   Verdict: not great, but not bad."}
{"text":"With an intimate space and defined menu, you get the idea they focus on the few things they do well.  And I would agree their authentic Chinese noodles are done really well.  Fresh ingredients in true flavourful soup base, I opted for the Golden Vinegar noodles ($10.99), an appetizing sour taste that ends with a hefty spicy bite; admittedly too spicy for me to handle. Along with the soup comes an assortment of vegetables, ham, 1 chicken wing, 3 slices of raw pork, and a bowl of noodles to be mixed into your soup base.   The Steamed Chicken with chili sauce ($6.99) as a starter was delightful.  The flavour and spice level was on point.  Spicy and savoury without the scorching torture as experienced from the Golden Vinegar noodle. This dish alone warrants a recommendation of this neat  authentic lil restaurant."}
{"text":"Good noodles, ok broth. Got the Golden vinegar one which is hot&spicy, and really liked it. Kiddo ate so that means it's kiddo approved. Ingredients are just ok, nothing special, I'd even say it's cheap options. (Corn, fungus, lettuce, small chicken wing, quails egg, cooked mince pork, one cherry tomato).  Small cozy place. One downside is that they have no washroom."}
{"text":"I ordered the spicy beef brisket noodle. Spice level: intermediate  Rice noodle: round, extra is free Beef: the beef slices comes raw for you to cook in the soup. Brisket was in the soup already, it lacked flavour Comes with a lot of sides. Corn, ham, preserved chicken wing (lacked flavour), quail egg, lettuce, and bean sauce (very good) There's no washroom, so you might have to find one in the building first. Ask for wet wipes if you just need to sanitize your hands.  Overall, free extra noodle was key! Will try something that's not spicy next time to taste the flavour of the soup.   Good luck finding parking during lunch on weekdays."}
{"text":"this place just recently opened up so we went for a visit.   Located just a little south of yonge and sheppard, this is a small restaurant.  They serve chinese noodles.  I ordered the tomato beef brisket sauce rice noodles.   service was pretty fast.   When I got the order, i thought it was like hot pot to me.   I got a bowl of boiling soup and a bunch of ingredients that i just basically pour into the bowl.   I am still not sure about the novelty of having the customer pour the ingredients into the boiling soup.  The bowl was alright and there was nothing special about it.   It just your typical average sit down place for chinese noodles."}
{"text":"I really liked the Golden vinegar soup base, it had the best combo of sour and hot. It was very flavourful and appetizing. They also give you enough meat on the platter. The appetizers were very mediocre, we ordered the potato and seaweed. Compared to the soup and noodle, the appetizers were fairly average at best. So skip the apps and stick with the soups and noodles."}
{"text":"Stumbled up on this place while in the area. It was around 8pm when my friend and I decided we were to eat something before leaving. The store at that time was around 1/3 full. What made us want to try this restaurant was that they just opened and were giving out free presotea with every noodle order, which was next door. I got the original rice noodles and my friend got the tomato beef braised sauce rice noodles.   The noodles came in a hot stone pot, making it still sizzle when it arrived to the table. Also came with it was a tray of a ton of toppings you add to your noodles. For me, the original rice noodle broth was okay, not that special for me. My friend enjoyed her meal, it was really good! They gave everyone the same presotea drink which was matcha red bean milk tea which was not sugary at all, that I liked.   When the bill came, I paid with debit and so I had no problems with the transaction. My friend on the other hand paid by cash. Something that was weird was that she was given the wrong amount of change. We told them that they gave her a shortage of change (was $0.70 short). And then they said that they charge $1 for something but she did not state exactly what it was and just gave my friend the full change...but they didn't charge me for it? Make sure to count your change."}
