{"text":"The funeral luncheon that was catered for our family was delicious. The food was plentiful and they packaged up the leftovers for us to take home. From start to finish, their servers took care of everything. The price was reasonable also."}
{"text":"Fligners has catered 3 of my party's so far. Best caters around. Can't wait till Christmas so we can do it again. Food is perfect, staff is friendly and helpful. I'm even going to start doing my main grocery shopping there because of the freshness and NO filers."}
{"text":"A little crazy in there at times, but it's because they're so good they can get crowded!  Their meats are fresh and really good. The servers behind the deli and bakery go above and beyond. They make great trays and such for weddings, funerals and parties. The market is clean...I like that, too. Their baggers will bag for you and take your cart to your car in their private parking lot."}
{"text":"So I just threw a surprise birthday party for my husband and had all our food catered from Fligner's. Coming from out of state, my first instinct was to go with a more known national chain like Famous Dave's. Til a friend, who lives locally, recommended Fligner's, and I am SO glad I decided to take a chance with them. 

First things first... I love that their catering menu is downloadable online, which made it easier. I did the a la cart option, and spent about $450 in food -- we had close to 50 people, everyone was stuffed, and we still had tons leftover after the party. Everyone loved the food. The fruits were fresh, the BBQ ribs were delicious, and the beef tenderloin and baked chicken were a hit. 

I also ordered the cake and some other pastries, and they most definitely did not disappoint. 

Best of all, their customer service was impeccable... everyone was super friendly, and they delivered the food right when thy said they would! I am completely HAPPY we had our food catered through them!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! So my mother is truly a very uptight New England blue blood lady and very demanding. 'That explains a lot about me lol.'
So anyway, she came from Boston and I flew up from Florida to visits some cousins for the holiday and my cousin asked my mother what she wanted for dinner and my mother said a Capon. If you don't know what a Capon is, it's a castrated rooster they make super fat.
So an oversized fat male chicken.
We called ahead and they still had some so we headed over but by the time we got there they were out of them! My cousin Jen and I freaked cause of my mother!  Like, what are we going to do now? 
We panicked! 
Then Jen got an idea to just buy the biggest fattest chicken we could find and have the meat guy just print a label for it that said Capon! He did. He laughed and did what we asked and saved Christmas!
My mother picked it up, looked at it and said 'looks like a good one'. We both breathed a sigh of relief.
Got back to the house with the fake Capon and all the fixins', explained to the chef cooking the situation and all was well!
Yup! We had a chicken for Christmas dinner! Haha!
That butcher saved Christmas and our asses.
I can't thank this store enough for playing along and that's what makes places great! 
Amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"I come back & stock up on my meat Fligners.  Especially my rind-off bacon. Fligners is a staple in my home town. A great place to shop"}
{"text":"Fligners is the best in my book! For Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, their catering has supplied my family with perhaps the best turkey and sausage stuffing we've ever tasted. The turkey was carved and oh so moist, the stuffing divine. I don't think I'll ever roast my own turkey again!
For the day after Christmas I bought a 4 rib prime rib roast from their meat counter. OMG it cooked to juicy perfection and I'm now the queen of holiday meals! Their prices just can't be beat.
Thanks Fligners I'm in love!!"}
{"text":"Once every six weeks or so I get in my little car, turn on Sirius and listen to book radio, liberal radio or old time radio shows as I head on west along the lake. This by itself is a pleasant way to pass an afternoon. Sometimes I make it to Sandusky which I will save for another review. More than likely I get to Lorain and more specifically Flignor's Market. 

There is a wide selection of produce but you have to know prices. Today a mango was cheaper than any where else but Vidalia onions were about twice what they sold for at Giant Eagle. As in the canned goods there is a wide array of Hispanic produce. The bakery and deli are comparable to the those of most supermarkets with two distinctions. The first is the kifle cookies.  Buttery little nutty mouthfuls at only $4.99 for a heavy dozen. Secondly, prices are low. If I were buying for a large family I would come here more frequently. 

So far I may not have convinced very many to shop here. Add a full service butcher shop. One that runs the entire length of the store where one person patiently waits on you as you walk from the sausages to the poultry to the meats to the fish. She asks you which steak you want, if you want the whole chicken breast split, or what other particular preferences you may have. Everything is wrapped in freezer weight bags. No where at any time have I ever had such service. The clincher is that all the meat is from Ohio farmers and hand cut at Flignor's. 

As you smugly grin at the checkout seeing the choice meats placed in bags and the register totaling far less than expected, a very polite young man gathers your bags to carry them to your car."}
{"text":"Great service and great prices this is my favorite place to go when I need to stock my deep freezer. I always get good quality meat and great customer service so it is worth the drive out to Lorain"}
{"text":"Fligner's is the best meat market in Lorain county and beyond! Besides having the best prices and quality of meats, Fligner's also has the BEST staff, helping with anything you're looking for, as far as cooking great food. I have to give a shout out about THE best deli, not to leave out the bakery! Artists are creating the most beautiful pastries, including the best biscuits, fresh breads, etc..."}
{"text":"Very disappointed my family and I have shopped for as long as I can remember. On the forth of July I had to work so I sent my husband to buy some beef ribs as we do not eat pork and the beef ribs had about 5lbs of fat and were not worth what I paid for them."}
{"text":"This store is nationally known in the industry as one of the largest meat service and deli counters in the states.  I have done business with them purchasing meat products (about 600 lbs a week) and have always been pleased.  Customer service is fantastic and great place for spanish cooking ingredients including authentic rice cooking pots!  

They also do catering!"}
{"text":"Got meat?

Walking into Fligner's is like walking into a time machine and heading back to 1950, a time when America was just like \"Leave it to Beaver.\" 

The first thing I always notice about Fligner's when I arrived is just how nice and helpful everyone is. I hate when places that have nice people borderline on being a bit stalkerish, but that is not the case at this grocery store. The cashiers, stock-boys, butchers and bakers are always kind, helpful and professional. The baggers even walk you to your car and unload your groceries! Now that's service!

If you are looking for fresh-cut meats for low cost then Fligner's is definitely your place. They always have plenty of people working behind the butcher counter so the service is quick. My favorite thing about their fresh meat section is that, for twenty cents extra a pound, they will trim all of the fat of of your purchase and filet it to your liking. They always give out tips on how to filet and properly cook your own meat at home. I don't think I ever learned anything new at a grocery store until I decided to go to Fligner's. 

Fligner's also has a pretty decent wine selection if you are looking for a nice bottle of wine to go with your fancy dinner.

Fligner's is located in the heart of downtown Lorain. Parking is in the back of the building near the entrance so don't park out front on Broadway. Check out their website for awesome coupons that they email to you."}
{"text":"This place is crazy awesome!!! They are really friendly. The meat is really great. They have everything. The meat counter is the length of the entire store and than some. Plus they sell chicken by the 40lb boxful! Check it out."}
