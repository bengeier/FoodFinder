{"text":"I love shopping at Colagelo's. It's an old school Italian market with a fabulous meat and cheese counter. The fruits and vegetables are always high quality, and at the end of summer locals flock here to pick up cases of vegetables and fruits for canning. But I come here weekly for the selection of meats and cheeses. Their sausages are among the best in Toronto, and trust me, I've tried most of them. They also have a great selection of Italian cooking accessories to help you make that perfect meal. I'll be here on Thursday, and try the veal!"}
{"text":"This family owned market is one of my favour market in Scarborough. I've been coming here since I was a kid. Every thanksgiving we pre order our fresh turkey here. They let you choose between how big you want the turkey and when you want to pick it up (week before thanksgiving). They always have fresh meat, fruits and vegetables. Everyone here is friendly."}
{"text":"Such high quality and good tasting items at the deli counter. We got Havarti slices, ricotta & chicken breast. The ricotta was sooooo creamy. ON POINT   They have a special hard pasta aisle with shapes I have never seen in my life! It's such a unique place. My dad bought me my first pasta machine here!!   It's small & pricy but for the quality is worth it."}
