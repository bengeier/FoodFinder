{"text":"Best Chinese Food in AZ. I am from SF and am used to the best Chinese. I haven't found one place that has come close to Bay Area food. This place tastes like home."}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday night. It is a horrible experience It took 15 mins for someone to take our order. Then, 20 minute later, the cold dish is serve with rice. The cold dish was alright but the rice was so hard, it is like uncook. I believe they rush it. Then, we were waited for one hour for two main dishes. It was really unreasonable. We have never been to a chinese restaurant that will make me wait for one hour for two dishes. I was so pissed I left before they make my food. I was there for 1 and half hour and we left hungry!!! The owner must hired more waitresses and chiefs. Otherwise, this place will be close in 6 months."}
{"text":"Quality was excellent. Food was fresh and reasonably priced. We ordered the house spicy special chicken, shredded pork with green onion, honey walnut shrimp, braised spicy shrimp in hot pot, and beef with string bean. The egg drop soup and sweet and sour soup was included with the lunch portions (two of the dishes we ordered was the lunch portion ones) and even the soup was excellent. This is the best Chinese/Szechwan food we have found in Phoenix yet. Will definitely return!   Ambiance was nice, facility was clean, restrooms clean. And they had a nice selection of beer- Heineken, Tsingtao, and coors light."}
{"text":"The place is crazy busy at dinner time, so expect to wait a little for a table. It is well worth it.   Do not come to this place for the hospitality. The wait staff runs all over the place when it is busy and just throws the food on the table... Lol...  The best Szechwan food in town! Get the Water Boiled beef! Or what ever protein you want to put in it! The flavor is amazing...Shredded pork in garlic sauce and the Szechwan green beans."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of vegetarian options in their Zen menu. I have been here a few times and it's been hit or miss. This last time the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Szechuan style food has a unique taste and is known for they're super spicy dishes. Pretty much everything has chili peppers in it. There's an under tone of Chinese five spice and star anise that I felt was in most of the dishes we ordered. But the waitress said it was Szechuan pepper corns and they make your tongue a little numb. I recommended: Mao's style braised pork, mapo tofu, shrimp fried rice, and chongqi spicy chicken. And like everyone has commented, this place is legit! Who cares that most everything is written in Chinese and the waitress has bad English. GREAT food is more important people !!! We happen to like our waitress very much :)"}
{"text":"My go-to for authentic Chinese food. I get nervous about some places but this one I \"trust.\""}
{"text":"Why don't the managers teach their staff how to properly refill the ice. I watched as each staff person poured Ice from a bucket into the soda machine. The staff member was gripping the inside of the container so each piece of ice passed over his hand. Gross"}
{"text":"This place is a pleasant surprise. I stopped in for an early dinner.The staff was very tentative. The food will surely surprise you. Fresh and extra large portions. Beef was tender. The pot stickers were the best. Oh, also tried the chicken ginger. Both entrees amazed me! I will continue going to this restaurant."}
{"text":"If your not into authentic Chinese spicy cooking, then don't waste your time or money. We were very pleased to find this cafe with the flavors we enjoyed while in China for the past few years. We enjoy the spicy chicken and pork chop (#58). So many local caf√©s are American Chinese and not authentic Chinese. They also offer a few Hunan style dishes....if your in a rush go to a drive thru....and remember, the staff is Chinese so speak slowly and be patient...they too are authentic."}
{"text":"Tried this place twice. Once for take out and once dine in. Both times we got the soft shell crab. Me likes! With all the fried garlic to pick at, Yum! It's a little on the $$ end, but hey, it's soft shell crab. I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had, but for what we can get around here, I was satisfied.   I'll just mention the things we got during the dine in since it was more recent and I remember it better... ;)  The cold appetizers - tofu, white - not spicy, greenish (not sure if that was tofu, but hey, I don't really mind. If it tastes good I'll try it!)  - little spicy, pig ear - spicy. All were delish!  There's a hot oil & spicy fish dish. They're known for it. That was super good! We did ask for it not to be as spicy and they accommodated us, which was nice. It was just enough kick for us. TRY THAT! She also recommended the equivalent dish, but with lamb. Next time I'd like to taste test that one.   The fried pork ribs were just normal. Nothing special or out of the ordinary. We also got a veggie dish. We always ask what kind of veggies they have. Sometimes they have ones that aren't on the menu.   All this filled the 6 of us and was pretty reasonable in price.   I liked the service. I mean really, I never go to a Chinese restaurant expecting good service. I just look forward to the food. But the lady gave us her recommendations. We were hesitant on the fish dish (bc we weren't sure if it'd be too spicy), and she told us to get the lunch portion vs the dinner since it was smaller and if we didn't like it, we wouldn't have as much. That was cool.   If you like spicy, I'm sure this place would fill your tank. If you aren't total spicy fans, there's still enough stuff and ways for them to accommodate to your liking, like they did for us."}
{"text":"The customer service is great, unusual for a Chinese restaurant. The spicy food is to die for. A little bit greasy, but still the best i my opinion."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice with mixed result.  The food is generally good to very good but a little inconsistent.  Service being normal to very slow.  Items on the \"Hot & Spicy Style\" menu is hot and tasty but can be very oily (I scooped out almost a small rice bow of pure oil from 2 dishes ordered).  Seafood items, I tried sauteed shrimp and salt & pepper calamari, are good with just the right amount of spicy and crunch.   Service is where this restaurant needs much improvement.  The first time I came at 11:30 am and were able to get out in 45 minutes.  The second time I came at 12:30 and spent 2 hours for lunch with most of the time waiting for the waiter to take order and do miscellaneous service like getting bows, spoon or cheque (I ended up getting the to-go box myself)."}
{"text":"Went to Szechwan Garden for lunch yesterday. This was our 4th or 5th time here. We have been trying different dishes to enjoy their flavors.   On this occasion we ordered:  Hot and sour soup that was excellent  Fish fillet in black bean sauce. very good  Eggplant with garlic sauce. Superior, the best I've ever had.  Pan-fried string bean. Again Superior. I think the beans were Chinese long beans  as they were crisp and without any large beans as so often is the case.  Overall the service was superior, attentive but not intrusive. The meal came quickly. And the bill came without having to chase down a waiter.   We had been frequenting the Miu's Cuisine since they opened, but find the Szechwan Garden to be more pleasant and the food just a little better."}
{"text":"Permit me to use this space to digress before proceeding to the review. In my short time here in PHX, I have observed two kinds of reviews of Chinese restaurants, often written for the same restaurant, but seemingly as if people had eaten at two completely different restaurants.  There is the sweet-and-sour pork/fried rice/egg roll crowd-type of review, where the patrons expect old school Cantonese American food. I am sad to report that style of cooking, if not already dead in most places, is but a shadow of its former self. Younger people think it is inauthentic or fake; I grew up around the people who cooked it in chop suey restaurants and served it mostly to non-Chinese, and thought it was delicious. It is now cooked by generally non-Cantonese folks, since the bosses and cooks have all largely retired if not passed on at this point, their children mostly having become professionals. The secrets of their cooking were taken with that generation to the grave, and subsequently, these writers are uniformly disappointed, as reflected in their reviews.  The other kind of review generally is written by the natives and the cognoscenti, who go to that same restaurant to eat from the so-called \"secret\" or \"Chinese menu\", and they have an entirely different, generally positive experience. Their experience reflects the reality that Chinese cuisine in the US became quite diverse after 1965. That year, American legal barriers that prevented Chinese from immigrating since 1882 were finally torn down, and as economic and migration changes occurred, many different regional Chinese cuisines started to appear here.   This is one of those reviews. Szechuan Garden, AKA ???, is one of those regional Chinese stars in the East Valley, and we're very lucky to have them here, along with several other great Sichuanese restaurants in Chandler. I hear you ask, if we should not expect Cantonese American food at a Sichuanese restaurant, then what should we eat?  Reader, let me finally put before you our typical Sichuan Thursdays menu: there is an amazing ????, kung pao chicken, at least as good as the storied memories of my childhood favorite, the Moon Palace/??? restaurant in Chicago, properly cooked here as a lightly sauced chicken and peanuts dish. ????, the lamb skewers, spiced with cumin, salt, and chili, are very good, but, an even better version of that is the ????, cumin lamb, which is a big plate of dry, stir-fried lamb with the same seasonings. ????, mapo tofu, is excellent here: the tofu is soft, sauced with Sichuan peppercorns and chili, producing the unusual signature \"ma la\" numbing heat feeling of Sichuanese food. ??, boiled dumplings, are good, but benefit from a dunk in ????, zhenjiang black rice vinegar, and some ginger slivers wouldn't hurt either. We also have had the ???, water-boiled fish, which is good, but, I think it is actually better elsewhere. All of this goes over rice. And you'll want a vegetable, which for us is usually ?????, dry-fried string beans, or the garlic spinach, both excellent. Service has been always very responsive and friendly despite my horrible, freshman-year level Putonghua spoken with a heavy Cantonese accent.   And now you know."}
{"text":"We often come here for their unique dishes and broad menu, all with an authentic taste. The green beans and house dumplings are special favs!  Good service and tasty food at moderate prices, what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Went here today.  Its pretty nice and clean inside. Everyone says its an \"authentic chinese place\" which I would agree with.  The waiters were polite. The prices were average.   As a vegetarian I was pleased to see a bunch of options. Soon enough though I learned almost all of their vegetarian options contain meat included. You can just ask for no meat but its a hassle imo.   The food was ok.  It had a unique taste but  was pretty plain. I ordered the homestyle tofu minus the meat and all it came with was tofu and 3-4 mushrooms. Nothing else. Normally this dish comes with a bunch of different veggies at other places.  The portion size was the smallest I have ever seen. I left hungry.  I will not be back. There are just too many other places to eat around here that are better value."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Lakewood. It's well worth the price. I've come here a lot and I always get something different, and almost everything has been great. The service is friendly and the restaurant is cute. The place is located in a miniature strip mall on Detroit, but don't judge a book by its cover- this restaurant is delightful on the inside and offers so much great stuff. The takeout is very speedy and never fails. The appetizers and the entrees have all been great. The atmosphere is comfortable and accommodating for everyone. I've gone on dates here, I've taken the kids I babysit here, and I've taken my extended family here. Everyone has loved it. The portions are generous, you're definitely going to have to be hungry! Every entree comes with their individualized traditional vegetable blends that go together nicely with the meat. My vegetarian friends find the zen menu to be delicious.   The only thing I would avoid here is ordering anything \"very hot\" (for some dishes, you can ask for them to be \"mild,\" \"medium,\" or \"very hot\"). The heat is definitely there and overwhelms the taste. Even at that, the taste isn't that great. However, the medium and mild are awesome. If you go, GET THE CRAB RANGOON as an appetizer. It is my favorite thing that I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"Some of the employees here are friendly and helpful. But I didn't appreciate the female maitre'd starting an argument with me over the size of my tip. That took nerve. She got an extra couple of dollars out of me that one time but lost a customer."}
{"text":"Very good. Service was friendly. It was nice to have a noodle bowl that was more unique than the usual fare. Would suggest English descriptions of all menu items for convenience."}
{"text":"Wow was this place great! Most of the patrons in there were chinese speaking people of college so right off I knew this was going to be good autthentic chinese food. We ordered so pretty tame items but the flavor was out of this world. Great Service even though the place was PACKED. We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"It's one of my to-go place whenever I crave for a good authentic Chinese meal."}
{"text":"They're finally back open! Some said it would never happen, but I was finally able to satiate my need for their Mongolian Beef! Better than I had remembered it."}
{"text":"Traveled there specifically to celebrate Chinese New Year in an authentic restaurant and was very pleased with the quality of both the food and service. My wife had the green onion ginger beef and I the spicy fish filet each from the lunch menu. The beef was among the best ever, and the fish, while delicious,, was somewhat too salty. The servers were welcoming and attentive acknowledging my halting Chinese with broad smiles. All of the restaurant staff were engaging and gracious throughout the entire meal. Large portions and good value for the price."}
{"text":"Best Chinese in the area. So much variety too! Seriously the best in the Phoenix metro area"}
{"text":"Love this place so much, I just need it to try it ones and then I became a regular, the food it's so good, full of flavour and so autentic, the portions are good size, and the service is so friendly. My favourite is the Hot and Sour sup, it's so delicious, the fry rice with shrimp, and the chicken with red peppers and ginger, I been trying different plates and you definitely can't go wrong with any of them, all so good and full of flavour. Definitely a must try highly recommended."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner here Saturday night.  We got there about 730. There were plenty of tables open which is not a usually a good sign. They reopened in October after remodeling for a year.  The exact same menu from 25 years ago.  The price increases was about 25 cents to a dollar. I have always loved their food and nothing has changed about that. We had 2 orders of potstickers which I believe are the best in Cleveland.  Also ordered kungpao chicken , scallops in garlic sauce,  and pan fried noodles.  We wouldn't order the noodles again but everything else was fresh and delish. We go there anytime we have the chance. Love it."}
{"text":"The WORST customer service EVER!    I tried to order beef chow fun.  I knew it wasn't on the menu, but being that I've ordered it multiple times, I thought  I knew the ropes.  Or I thought I did.  I usually order it, they go in the back, talk to the chef and I get my beef chow fun.  Tonight,, we came across a very rude, short bald guy.  He assured me they never had chow fun and that I must've went somewhere else.  He even went as far as showing me the menu.  I told him I knew it wasn't on the menu but they made it before.  I asked him to ask the chef, he refused.  Whatever.  I let it go and tried to order our other dishes but this guy kept talking about the beef chow fun.  At one point, I asked him to drop it.  Instead of dropping it, he proceeded to tell my mom that he could make it at home, but he can't bring it from home.  Really?  WTF?  Drop it dude.  We tried to continue to order but he kept talking about the beef chow fun and laughing at us.  News flash: We were there to eat and pay for our food.  Not be degraded and harassed by a lazy waiter.  We wound up leaving.    I will never go back.   I hope it was worth losing a family of 6 that has been loyal customers for 3 years."}
{"text":"4 star for food quality! Lovely food. I would order take away rather eating there as restaurant setting is not so appealing. It smells over there pretty bad if u want to dine in."}
{"text":"Came here with my parents who did all the ordering.  I love this place!  The food is really authentic, but you can also order the dishes less spicy.  Everything we ordered was excellent, but my favorite was the fried mushrooms.  There was a unique spice, and the mushrooms were sliced very thin.  It's so different that you have to try it if you like mushrooms.  You can't go wrong with anything you order.  All dishes are so flavorful and well made."}
{"text":"My husband loves Szechuanese food. We went for his Birthday and we really enjoyed every dish. Definitely worthy of the five star rating."}
{"text":"The Service here is great for a fast past place. Being from Southern California I find it hard to find Chinese food worth ranting about. The food here is very good and well priced. I was even offered a cup of ice water as I waited for my take out order to be prepared (which I ordered in person); which consisted of chicken fried rice, beef and broccoli, sesame seed chicken, and orange chicken. It's not the prettiest place inside, the layout is awkward but the food is great hands down. I ordered over the phone last time and that was somewhat challenging, at that visit I ended up with something I didn't want but it was so good I came back for more!"}
{"text":"Oh, Szechuan Garden, how I love you. My mom and dad went on their first date here 25 years ago. When my vegetarian boyfriend finally moved to Cleveland, I took him here too.  Don't let the sketchy outside fool you, inside is a Chinese food lovers paradise. They have two distinct menus, one with as many vegetarian and vegan friendly versions of food as you could possibly imagine, and one that is more traditional. Growing up, we always got the Szechuan Duck and I would take it to elementary school as leftover lunch like a huge, foreign weirdo kid. Which I absolutely was.  Even today, this food is amazing. It doesn't leave you feeling sick and slimy like some other Chinese food, and it genuinely fills you up. The portions are huge, the veggies are fresh and there is never a wait for a table.  I hope this place never ever closes."}
{"text":"Holy Vegan Paradise!  I found Szechwan Garden by searching for new vegan options around Cleveland, and what a pleasant surprise!  First of all, the basically have two menus in one.  The front half of the menu is everything you would expect to find at a good Chinese restaurant.  The second half of the menu, called the Zen Menu contains a HUGE selection of vegetarian vegan options.  It is basically everything on the normal menu, but made vegan.  This is not your typical \"substitute tofu for the meat\" way of \"veganizing\" an entree either.  They have vegan meat substitutions for beef, pork, chicken, shrimp, fish, scallops, you name it!  It reminded me of dining at The Vegiteranian (sadly, now closed).  We started out with the Zen wonton soup.  It comes in a large bowl, and serves 2.  The waitress spooned it out into two separate bowls for us.  Next, we had the Zen boneless BBQ ribs.  I think my wife and I were a little skeptical to try this \"fake pork\", but it was fantastic!  It looked more like pulled pork, and had a great texture and flavor.  I think it was some form of seitan.  For our entrees, we both ordered the General Tso's chicken, and asked for it extra spicy.  If you have read my other reviews, you would know that restaurants rarely make things spicy enough for me when I order extra spice.  Much to my surprise, they nailed it on this one.  The serving size was enormous.  You could really split it with somebody.  The veggies were fresh, and the \"chicken\" was very tasty.  It was empty when we went for dinner, but then again, my wife and I usually go out to dinner when most nursing homes are still cleaning up their lunch service.    I try to eat plant based foods as much as possible, but this place is such a nice treat.  It allowed me to eat at a restaurant and feel like I was ordering anything off the menu that I wanted, just like a real person!  I can't wait to go back and try something else.  If you are vegan, or just like really good Chinese food, this is a must try."}
{"text":"This place has authentic Szechwan cuisine.  People who are used to pseudo-Szechwan cuisine from other restaurants will find some differences.  Be sure to try their Water Boiled Fish Filet with Chili pepers.  This dish comes in a bowl (as it looks more like a soup) and is topped with cilantro.  I tried it for lunch and will definately return for dinner.  They don't have alcohol yet but have applied for their permit."}
{"text":"Best authentic Chinese in AZ. Hot pots are highly recommended. Just wish we had places like this closer to Peoria."}
{"text":"I have grown up on Szechuan Garden since I was a tot.  My most favorites are the Hunan Beef, The Empress Chicken and THE MOST AMAZING Fried Rice known to man.  Seriously, I have tried MANY different kinds of fried rice and Szechuan's cannot be beat.  I don't eat fried rice unless it is from this place.  The owners are so amazing and dedicated to bringing the best.  I prefer dining in because I love seeing the owners and the food but I gotta say, take out is just as amazing! My family and I have been going there for the last 10 years the night before Christmas.  This place is a big part of our family traditions!  Once you try it, you will never think of Chinese food the same!"}
{"text":"First time here. Honestly, probably the best Chinese food in Phoenix. Authentic. Delicious. Great flavor. Highly recommend. I had #20 or #21 (sliced chicken) spicy. Definitely had a little kick to it but not overly spicy at all."}
{"text":"My daughter tells me, next time I'm in her area for lunch I should call her and she'll meet us. My wife is Chinese and we spent time in Sichuan and both love Sichuan and Hunan cooking.  So we meet at Szechuan Garden. My wife is certain to get her favorite Hunan frog legs which of course my daughter won't touch. But my wife drags my daughter over to the cold 'deli' counter and when they return, my daughter has a sickened look on her face and basically is telling me that she can't believe the things they eat. Anyway, the deal is like 3 selections from the cold deli for $6. The cold chicken is very tasty, the tofu strips were a concession for my daughter and the pigs ear skin in Sichuan pepper oil were one of the things that my daughter was struggling with - but rather tasty. Those with less of a sense of adventure should definitely get the beef tendon in the pepper oil since it is one of the things that truly reminds me of being in Chengdu.  My daughter gets a rather bland, Cantonese lunch and of course is unimpressed. Wife suggests that this probably isn't the place to bring my daughter who pretty much has issues with eating anything that reminds her that it once walked/flew/swam on earth.  But of course that leads me to the second phase of this review... the next time I go there.  I'm to meet my wife there and I am running late. She orders without me. Frog legs and pigs ears were not on today's table... Now I pride myself on being able to eat pretty much anything and I certainly recognize that the only thing Chinese won't eat is the oink itself but today is a struggle.  Wife has already ordered and already gracing the table is another Hunan inspiration but instead of frog legs, it's pork intestines. I pause a moment and say, what the heck and I'm almost embarrassed to admit that it was outstanding. Next up was the cold deli mix which contained my favorite oil/pepper mix but instead of beef tendon (my #1 choice) or pigs ear (eh), my wife suggests that this is cow lung. That Sichuan peppery oil has a chocolate quality to it... enough of it could probably make shit taste good. I'm really struggling though with the psychology of eating pigs intestines and cow lungs. Thankfully, we had the lamb ribs dry rubbed with cumin which although was rather sparse in the available meat category, the flavor was rather exceptional.  So this is the bottom line here. If you want to eat Szechuan (and the real Chinese pinyin spelling is Sichuan), you have to:  - do as good as you can to suspend your beliefs on what is edible and be willing to try something out of ordinary to find the real live food tastes available here.  - don't order Cantonese items... go to a Cantonese restaurant for Cantonese food. Cantonese is sweet, plain, bland. Egg Foo Young, Fried Rice, Orange Chicken, Sweet and Sour anything... go somewhere else. This is the Szechuan Garden.  - definitely do a plate from the cold deli counter and make sure you get something with the Sichuan peppery oil whether it's beef tendon or even just the cold chicken with the oil... it's a true slice of Sichuan  - Water boiled (fish / beef / chicken) etc. is incredible and most highly recommended.  - Hunan cuisine is quire rare in the valley and while I won't say that Szechuan Garden is great Hunan cuisine, it's certainly quite good, definitely different.  I'm hoping that there's laws on the books that prevent restaurants from selling dog because my wife would definitely order it. As it is, she is under instructions never to let me eat dog when I am with her in China and as insurance, a secondary promise to not tell me that I am eating dog.   As for the pork intestine... I admit it was extremely good and while I would have a difficult time ordering it myself, if it's put in front of me, I'm sure I would eat it again.  Restaurant... don't know about Szechuan Palace now that they changed ownership but this is one of the real gems in the valley"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout and the experience left us incredibly disappointed and hungry. The meat in my wonton soup was raw. The chicken in our various dishes was so soggy, despite ordering it fried extra crispy. The noodles in the peanut dish were so overdone they were falling apart and the sauce was like thick gelatinous peanut butter. We ended up throwing it all away."}
{"text":"I am always a little weary of ordering Chinese food from a new location because of how many bad places there are. However, these reviews held up to the test.  My fiance and I just moved to Lakewood and boy did we find the spot.  We ordered the usual, General Tso;s and some potstickers.  First off, they asked... \"how spicy (for my General Tso).  I have never been asked this, I have always had to request extra spice, and extra crispiness.  This General was the bomb.  Super spicy and extra crispy.  It was perfect.  The potstickers were delicious as well.  Overall, this place is definitely now our go-to place for ordering."}
{"text":"This is my favorite chinese restaurant!  It has an amazing vegetarian menu (the zen menu).  The menu offers a huge number of faux meat dishes and more traditional tofu or veggie dishes.  I have tried almost every single dish and they are all great!  My favorites are the salmon w/ asparagus, mandarin eggplant, and kung pow chicken.  The ham fried rice is amazing!  I could go on and on about szechwan!!"}
{"text":"I love their shrimp and eggs. A very simple dish but always a hit! It usually takes them less than 10min to get this dish out.  Portions are good. Their lunch menu are great to share with friends."}
{"text":"The place is clean.   The food is edible.  It's not good!  The garlic chicken tastes like salt,  and the kung poa chicken tastes like hot salt.  We won't be back.  Blech!"}
{"text":"It's not decent Szechwan food at all. If you just want to get American Asian food, that's fine."}
{"text":"This restaurant is fucking stupid. Food is extremely bad and the server's attitude is really bad. We came to eat at 6:30 and our food was coming in 7:00, last time, they charged me 18 more dollars and they do not want to refund it to me . I will not go to that fucking place again. FUCK."}
{"text":"Not good.  Not worth only one star, because I only reserve that rating for a truly horrific experience. Szechuan Garden's food was not criminal; just really, really not good.  Maybe it's just me. I don't know! As my stalkers know, I really only order the same three or four things every time I have Chinese food. This time I went for the wonton soup and NOT the chicken and broccoli, but this fried tofu and cashew stir-fry.  The soup's broth was ok, and very flavorful. However, a good broth does not make up for poor wontons. Mushy wontons! Mystery meat filling! It had the texture, flavor and color of mystery meat. Gross.  Why didn't I go with my staple and order Chicken and broccoli, you ask? (Well, you didn't, but I'm going to pretend like you did.) Because it wasn't on the menu. Huh?! That's right. Chicken and broccoli. Not on the menu.  I know, I know, I could have just ordered the Chicken and mixed vegetables, and asked for just broccoli and no additional vegetables. I could have ordered the Beef and broccoli and asked to sub chicken. But you know what? I thought I'd try something else. And wow, I was not happy with it. The veggies were huge and overpowering, like long tall thick mushroom stems, for example, and they were sorta steamed but then thrown in this heavy sauce so they got all soggy. Same thing with the tofu. I looove me some tofu. But when it's advertised as \"fried,\" and then it comes as \"soggy,\" me no likey.  My husband -- who will eat just about anything -- took one bite of his chicken and garlic sauce and said, \"No. Not good.\" And didn't eat any more. (I know this was hard for him to do, too, because he always loves to prove me wrong, and I said the food was bad before he started eating, and he was like, \"Yeah, sure, whatever, you're just a snob.\" Eat THAT Derek!)  The egg roll was sooort of ok, but overall had too much squishiness and not enough crispy/greasiness.  I appreciate the \"Zen\" menu and the vegetarian/vegan slant, but you can still do that and make great food. Hell, you can do that at a non-\"Zen\" Chinese place if people care enough to have it done.  Szechuan fail."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and dinner a few times with friends.   I am impressed by how consistent and good their food is. I would like to come here for lunch more often, but they're usually understaffed and it takes a while to get served and cashed out.  I'd recommend coming here for dinner, it's definitely with a try."}
{"text":"I was excited to learn that this restaurant had an extensive vegetarian menu but after trying the food was utterly disgusted and disappointed. I ordered the peanut sesame noodle dish. The noodles were overcooked and terribly soggy, the peanut sauce was a brownish-tan thick pudding consistency that looked and tasted like garbage. I was so hungry I really tried to eat it but after a few bites I felt an overwhelming feeling that I needed to stop because the food was sickening.   My boyfriend had the same experience with his zen trio rice dish. It was a combination of faux chicken, beef and shrimp that looked like it could be a children's toy; steamed and covered with an inedible sauce that left us full of very low quality food and feeling sick.   I appreciate them trying to accommodate vegetarians but if you are a vegetarian do not be fooled. The food is such poor quality and horribly prepared you would be better off eating McDonalds."}
{"text":"FINLEY found a place that does kung pao the way it's suppose to be done! Green onions & red peppers without a chunk of celery or green bell in sight!"}
{"text":"I love this place. When a friend recommended I get the cheesy pineapple shrimp I thought she must be joking, but I'm addicted. It's made out of a sweet vegan cheese substitute with jumbo shrimp, pineapple chunks, and a serving of white rice on the side. I also like to order their crab rangoon, or try items from their \"zen\" menu, a completely vegan/ vegetarian menu that simulates meat dishes. I have no idea what most of it is made out of, but I've tried the Zen Peking Duck and really enjoyed it. I'd like to try some of their Zen \"shrimp\" or \"fish\" dishes. Never have to wait long for takeout, they've always gotten my order spot on."}
{"text":"I grew up on this restaurant, and it is the only Chinese take out I would ever consider.   I remember going to college, taking Szechuan Garden for granted, and ordering Chinese for the first time with my sorority sisters. I picked out a sesame chicken. When it arrived, I was so disappointed I had to give it away to somebody else. There is just no replacement for this restaurant in my heart (or on my tastebuds).  The decor on the inside is fun; they have the most amazing crystal chandelier hanging in the dining room. We love going here when we want to get out of the house without making a huge to-do of the date night by trying a new place. You can come here in jeans or dressed up, and it's easy to get a table right away.   We also love ordering take out from here. We're not big on take out (we're pretty avid home cooks), but when we have a hankering for Chinese and don't feel like making it ourselves, we always pick up the phone and order from Szechuan Garden.  My favorite dishes would have to be the Szechuan Fried Noodles, Cashew Chicken, the Barbecued Sparerib Appetizer (it's unlike any other spare rib I've ever had-sweet and not coated in sauce), General Tso's (we ask for it hot because we love the extra spice!), Lemon Chicken (the sauce is so light and wonderful), Sesame Chicken, and Beef with Snow Peas. I've never met a dish I didn't like here, so give it a go!"}
{"text":"I love Chinese food especially szechaun style Chinese food. I usually order the tong qi chicken but today I let the waiter order for me & he did not disappoint. He ordered salty pork, which is stir fried pork belly tossed with veggies in a black bean sauce. He paired it with garlic eggplant which was also delicious."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for asian cuisine in Lakewood, since Wu's closed many years ago.  Everything there is good.  It's not too fancy, but the food is great. The only thing that sucks is the parking lot."}
{"text":"They have lunch special 7 days a week from 11 to 3 but the amount of food is not stingy kind of amount. Very tasty ! My fav is the egg and shrimp, fish with black bean and the normal dish spice fried chicken!"}
{"text":"I came a long time ago with a friend who used to live in Sichuan for almost 2 years. He recommended this place as his go-to place base on how much he love the real Sichuan taste here. I like their hotpot which has a lot of Hua Jiao (Sichuan pepper) in it and when I accidently bit it, my mouth gets numb and it was not a great feeling at all. The dan dan mian was tasty and very juicy too, will try this one again if I come back. My friend had the order of the dumplings swimming in hot oil which to me, not a fan, but to my friend, he ordered it every time he came in so I basically had chance to try his \"real Sichuan dish\". I also order the Vegetable Egg Foo Young and it was unexpectedly so good, but we were too full to finish it so i asked for a togo box to have it for my lunch the next day.  Service is great, very attentive!!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now. The place is typical, seems fairly clean but a rather boring and dirty fish tank at the front is the first thing you notice. There is a small amount of cramped parking as it shares a tiny lot with a few other businesses. The service has been par, the girl typically working the front counter likes to talk on her phone loudly about her personal stuff whenever there isn't a customer ordering. I don't really mind that personally but I could see how that might annoy some of the people dining in. As for the food, each time I've just gotten simple take-out... fried rice, spring rolls, sesame chicken, everything I've gotten here has been fairly good and consistent. It's a little better prepared and higher quality than your typical cheap Chinese joint, they even have a large vegetarian version of their menu. Good portions, fair prices, just a good reliable place for some quick chinese."}
{"text":"my favorite chinese restaurant.  could find no other restaurant that came even close while they were closed.  my friends and i have been waiting anxiously and finally went last night.  The sweet and sour chicken was excellent as always in the past.  The won ton soup was also great.  It seems the sauce for the spring rolls was a little bland not as sweet as i remember.  The staff is the same and happy to please .  Will be back"}
{"text":"Ive been here now about 5 times.if you want Chinese.it doesnt get any better.seriously you have got to try this place.i cant say enough good things about it.AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"If you like food that is any of these things - spicy, zesty, flavorful, ethnic, unusual, or even just interesting - you must try this place. As a normal American guy I can't pretend to know much about \"authentic\" Chinese or Szechuan cuisine, but this sure seems authentic to me.  Most of their menu (that I've tried) is characterized by lots of peppers, oil, a good amount of vegetables, and well-balanced, unique flavor combinations. I'd highly recommend Hot and Spicy anything (especially Hot and Spicy Fish), Salt and Pepper Calamari, Lamb with Cumin, and the Eggplant dish (can't remember the exact name, but I think there's only one).  If you aren't adventurous, don't like spicy foods, or are unsettled by the presence of items like \"Flaming Pig Intestines\" on the menu, then...well... maybe you should sit this one out."}
{"text":"The food is great the only thing is when it's busy they don't have enough waiter's for the tables."}
{"text":"Great food.  My Mother and Father whom both are from China loved the food.  The service was fast and pleasant.  They must of worked out all the kinks out.  Would return."}
{"text":"I really liked this place!! Looks like  a pretty authentic Chinese restaurant. We went for lunch. We were seated and greeted very nicely. The waitress was very kind and checked on us periodically through the meal. Just enough! Their lunch is a pretty good deal. Plates are categorized by $5, $6, $7 categories. About 10 per category. And the meal comes with rice and hot n sour soup which was some of the best I've had. I asked for medium spice since I know this kind of Chinese food is known for the spice but when the dishes came they were very mild. But the flavor was extremely good. Now I know next time I can handle the regular spice. We got the ginger scallion beef ($7), fish fillet with hot chili peppers($7), and the eggplant in garlic sauce($5). We had PLENTY of leftovers between the two of us. All were great but surprisingly the eggplant was our favorite. Can't wait to go back to try more dishes!! :)"}
{"text":"If I want great, authentic Chinese food then this is where I will go. If i want to try something adventurous this is where I go. They have great lunch specials that are on the menue, your usual American stuff, orange chicken, some fish dishes, some teriaka stuff. If you want to try something fun then you can ask the waiter to translate some of the specials that are posted on the wall in Chinese. I have never had something I did not like from here. Top marks for service, flavor and adventure."}
{"text":"We ordered a chicken dish and it was popcorn chicken with fried peppers.  We told them that the dish was disappointing and they offered a different chicken dish.  The other dish was chicken pieces with jalape√±o peppers and teriyaki sauce.  The rice was old and cold.  We also had soup which was disappointing. Definetly not your typical Chinese food."}
{"text":"The calamary and pepper is good. I ordered orange chicken, it is not the regular orange chicken that you've got when you are going to the chinese restaurant. it was tasty too. The restaurant was packed on Friday night. Service is not too good, but i definately will be back because the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan. This is very authentic Chinese just so you know. I have to watch my sodium and after eating here my ankles and feet swelled. If your looking for frog this is your place. Most menu is in Chinese language and wait staff are hard to understand."}
{"text":"Located in a strip mall at the southwest corner of Ray and Rural is Szechwan Garden - a place I have gotten take out from a number of times. Came here today with some friends and I was thinking perhaps I should have warned them. We got seated right away and were handed menus. These were the regular menus and they had stuff like pig intestines, frog, kidneys, lungs. Also on the wall were specials written out in chinese characters. There were probably 40 people in there for late lunch/early dinner and we were the only table speaking to our servers in English. I was expecting one of my friends to say something along the lines of: \"Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Panda Express/Pei Wei/PF Chang's anymore.\" But no - everybody was totally into it. We got the Crispy Sesame Duck - fried and salted with juicy crispy skin. That one was a winner. We also got Mapo Tofu - always a winner with me since I love the soft tofu in black bean sauce and Szechwan spices and oil. We also got the Shredded Pork In Hot Garlic Onion - which was also delicious. Service was great. We had an unruly kid in our midst but the servers were VERY patient with him. Once the food came he calmed down and dug into it. Needless to say we all left full and happy. My goto place for Szechwan has been both Szechwan Garden and Szechwan Palace ever since Miu's closed. This one is the closest to where I live so I know I will be back again. It's in a strip mall in a corner by itself so there's always lots of parking. Check it out."}
{"text":"Probably the best Chinese food I've ever had, and I don't really like Chinese food. My husbands friend is from China and he recommended the place. He even went with us and ordered in Chinese. The menus are all in Chinese and English - very authentic with many, many choices!   Family style dining with a big lazy susan in the middle to make sharing easy. Loved the orange chicken - lightly breaded with no chewy fat pieces like I'm so used to getting at other places. My brother got the sweet and sour ribs and they were also delicious.   Would highly recommend - its even cheap, under $10 a plate (big enough for 2-3 people to eat from with complimentary rice)"}
{"text":"i LOVE the food here, most the staff doesn't speak english, and most the guests are chinese, that's when you know the place is really authentic! Most items in the menu are on the spicy side, i particularly like the kung pao chicken and ma po tofu. The rice is bottomless, and you can eat a ton here for under $10."}
{"text":"I've dined in once and gotten food to go several times now. I have always enjoyed the food!  I am a vegetarian and I rarely find such a veg-friendly Chinese restaurant.  The Zen menu is entirely vegetarian and is very, very extensive. I got some fake chicken that was essentially just very well cooked tofu.. but that's not a bad thing! I love when a restaurant can cook tofu well. :)   Very friendly staff and overall a nice restaurant. Huge portions. It's a little too small and quiet for me to like dining in which is the only reason it's only 4 stars."}
{"text":"So glad to have this restaurant back in operation.  We've been patronizing Szechuan Garden for over 20 years.  Food is consistently good and portions are large; more importantly, food is very tasty."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple times and have loved every meal. It is authentic Szechwan food and flavor. The waitresses are nice and attentive and the service is relatively fast. Perfect for a lunch break. The best part is that the taste and the price. For lunch, there is a wide array of options such as Mapo tofu. I would recommend the Eggplant in garlic sauce and a shredded pork with green onions. However, I have had almost the whole menu and loved most everything. For those that want even more authentic foods, they have a cold dish area where you can pick some prepared foods."}
{"text":"In the East Valley, this restaurant is the closest thing my wife (from Szechwan, China) can get that tastes like home.  They have a cold dish bar too.  I generally like their food, though I had their beef noodles and was horribly disappointed.  It tasted nothing like the ????? I know and love.  Other downsides is that their restaurant is kind of cramped, especially when it gets busy.  Service isn't particularly great either: not mean but not keeping up with business and not proactive.  Also outside is a little stinky.  On the whole though, their food keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"I'm a Sichuanese native who is very picky about spicy food. However, I was still impressed by their Chongqing hotpot (after I asked them to add extra spices).   The quantity was very generous, with a big pot of shrimp, meat, tofu, blood tofu, sprouts, fish fillet, tropes, and Chinese cabbage. It is more than enough for two people with good appetite.   Their soup may not be completely original (it tastes similar to those sauce packets you get from Asian markets), but the flavors and tastes are definitely there, way better than those fake hotpots served in Asian-fusion restaurants.   Their menu comes with great varieties of sichuanese food. I'd definitely like to explore other dishes next time.   One little suggestion for their ??? (cold chicken fish soaked in chili oil): maybe you can serve the sesame paste on the side as an optional sauce, since the original sichuanese recipe doesn't come with sesame paste, but only sesame seeds. The paste itself makes the chicken look more creamy and adds this thick flavor to it that might defeat the purpose of 'cold dish' served for hot summer weather. Plus, sesame paste, to my knowledge, comes from northern China and is not commonly used in authentic Sichuanese dishes. Just a thought.   Overall, I was very happy about my first encounter with this restaurant. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Highly Overrated!!  If you are asking if it's the best Chinese in the immediate surrounding area...then yes, it's the best Chinese food. Sure, it's better than Wangs, and the place over in the Kyrene and Ray strip mall but it's not better than Gold Chef.   For one thing, the spring rolls are reheated frozen spring rolls; it's obvious! Pretty bush league if you ask me...especially for a restaurant that people are giving 5 stars to; they were mushy and cold as if they were reheated. There are no egg rolls on the menu and while some of you may respond by saying it's not a Cantonese restaurant...my response to that is...they offer other Cantonese items so why didn't you offer egg rolls too. I know a frozen spring roll like the back of my hand. The food also lacks seasoning. The flavors are good but it could be better. For a Szechwan restaurant, the food was lacking in heat and flavor. While it's good, it's also underseasoned. The fried rice is lacking flavor. When my wife had to apply Sriracha to her Szechwan style Chinese food...that's a bad sign!  But I will say this dishes are prepared well. You don't see any of the pale watery chicken dishes that you observe at most other \"good Chinese restaurants\" that you witness in the Valley. If you live in the immediate area, you will not be disappointed getting carry out but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food ever! Not the best looking place but the food is fantastic! Best spring rolls and Fried rice! Very authentic!"}
{"text":"First time here. Brought my mother here for lunch. Ordered the seafood crispy noodles, honey walnut shrimp and orange beef - it was all delish! Staff was very friendly as well. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Authentic Chinese food with friendly service. Enjoyed lotus root, fresh mushrooms in hot pot and hot n sour soup."}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews I was so excited to go here! I ordered the fried tofu and mixed vegetable lunch special. To my disappointment, the food had no spice at all (asked for medium), the brown sauce was completely watered down, and the food had a fishy aroma to it. Also, the rice was way overcooked! I ordered take out and took it to work so I didn't have extra condiments but I did salt the heck out of it to make it bearable. I'm not a picky eater and don't often give bad reviews but this was the worst chinese food I've ever had. It was only $4.95 so I guess I got what I paid for. Since it was so cheap and I'm local, I would give this place another shot. Maybe they hired a new chef...and he will soon be fired? With so many positive reveiws, I'm convinced today was an off day."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my mom, who spent most of her life in Taiwan, and my brother, who lives in San Francisco (where good Chinese food is abundant).   We ordered Water Boiled Fish, Tong Qing Spicy Chicken, Xiao Long Bao and Stir-fried Green Beans. We thoroughly enjoyed every dish, but especially loved the Tong Qing Spicy Chicken. Sichuan cuisine is known for its numbing pepper corns and spicy chili oil, both of which were prominent in the spicy chicken dish.   Authentic Chinese restaurants aren't really known for their ambiance and service, so if you're looking for a nice night out, you might want to go somewhere else. If you're looking for good authentic Sichuan food, this is your place!"}
{"text":"I had to return my food. Lo mein noodles were undercooked and bland. Went to return my meal and the staff seemed too busy and overwhelmed to help me, I stood there with 5 others for some time to get waited on."}
{"text":"Food is 5 star authentic Chinese...street level... Very good... Place is small but still very cozy...English was broken but the food makes up for any lack of understanding..."}
{"text":"Szechwan Garden is a nice Chinese restaurant, which is worthy of having a dinner if you like Szechwan dishes. There are three stars at the top of the website of Szechwan Garden, which is evaluation index for this restaurant. In addition to that, there are many reviews below about restaurant setting, taste of dishes and price and so on from customers. Most of people who like spicy speak highly of its dishes, but someone who do not like chili remark that dishes are so spicy that they cannot swallow it."}
{"text":"I grew up eating Oakland/San Francisco Chinatown on a regular basis and I can comfortably say this is the best and most authentic Chinese food in the Phoenix area. Everything else is a distant second. The menu is as diverse as it is excellent, the ambiance is great, and take out is hassle free. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking authentic flavors and a menu that you simply can't go wrong with."}
{"text":"Wish I lived closer to Szechwan Garden - I love their spicy dishes.  I don't understand people who rave about this restaurant, then give it just 3 or 4 stars. I think it among the best Chinese restaurants I've been to. We ordered Tong Qing Spicy Chicken (boneless) and shredded pork (#34). Contrary to a lot of reviews, the food here is not burn-your-mouth hot, just spicy & flavorful. Food was served very quickly, though we were there at an off-peak time.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We ordered the lamb pot and green beans. Soooo good! Authentic Chinese food with great taste! Honestly, I was full but couldn't stop eating till there's absolutely nothing left on he table!    We were going to the Thai place next door but they weren't open yet. So glad we took the detour and went in the Szechwan Garden! Didn't order the usual Szechwan spicy dishes but rather home style winter dishes, mom and I both really enjoyed it. The stew reminded me of college time back home and you can't go wrong with the green beans."}
{"text":"The food was tasty here and the service was great. I especially like the slice level here. If you order the delicious xiao long bao, order that first because it takes time to steam"}
{"text":"The place was full of Chinese folks so you know that is always a good sign. We liked the eggplant but the beef dish was too salty. Service was rushed and the staff was hustling."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and ordered several items: crispy onion pancake, shanghai style steamed dumplings, saut√©ed fish filet, and a sweet and sour type pork spare ribs (don't remember the actual name).  My 3 yr old daughter liked the dumplings so much we ordered a 2nd one.  Overall, their food is very good.  Maybe the best szechwan food in the East Valley. The only complaint I had with our visit is more with the service.  Their service is probably like a lot of Chinese restaurants where the wait staff is not very friendly and attentive.  Good food, ok service."}
{"text":"We love this place. The decorations and open kitchen is my favorite.  This is the most authentic szechwan restaurant in AZ. business is always pack too. Spicy water boil fish, cumin lamb, spicy eggplant, chicken skewer, sizzling rice seafood soup, name a few, so so many dish that we want to try, we will definitely going back."}
{"text":"I haven't been here awhile since we have been dining at Chou's Kitchen The food was still good but the service went downhill tonight the restaurant was not even busy. Our waters were never refilled. We had to get our to go boxes to pack our leftovers. Maybe I should get to go next time."}
{"text":"Wow what the hell just happened in my mouth?  Went here for lunch today and had the hot/spicy beef, I was a little confused when my tongue went numb.  Had to ask the waitress if that's supposed to happen, yup.  Some weird awesome pepper they use that doesn't have an English name.  Wonton soup was the cats ass, great!  Think we were the only white people in here so obviously it's the place to go to.  Hot/spicy chicken next week, this place and magic noodle are my new favorites for Chinese food."}
{"text":"Szechuan cuisine is one of the most famous Chinese cuisines. It is known for its spicy flavor.  Fortunately, Szechwan Garden is an authentic Szechuan restaurant where the food has beautiful colour and Mouth-watering smell. I'm addicted to it!"}
{"text":"If you try to give your pallet new experiences, flavors, you may NOT have ever tasted, there is a dish for you.  Although, I must warn you.  It is spicy!  My wife is asian and I eat a lot of Asian food.  Chinese food has always been at the bottom of my list for my asian food preferences.  Thai, Korean, Vietnamese and Japanese food are preferred before Chinese food.  However, this restaurant has literally moved the entire genre chinese food up my list!  Wow!!!    - Fish Fillet with Hot Chilli Peppers  (SPICY & delicious).    I only had one dish, but I may never have another when I eat here.  This dish is soooooo good, if you like spicy.  There is something in it that I haven't tasted since I ate spiced Jako while I was in Japan.  There isn't an english word for this ingredient, but it is a small herb about the size of a peppercorn, that causes a tingle in your mouth.  (My mouth is watering while I type).    This little herb mixed with the hot chili peppers and light tender white fish.  What a delight!.....almost sensual!  If there were 6 six stars on Yelp's rating system, I would give them to this dish.  An epicurean delight.      Oh and the prices really good too!"}
{"text":"Szechwan Garden has been one of my go to places for Chinese food on west side for many years. Stopped by for lunch with my mother this Wednesday afternoon and we both enjoyed our meals. A few housekeeping items, parking can sometime be a bit tough. Szechwan Garden is in a small shopping strip that has a few parking spots, searching for street parking does sometime come into play. The decor is alright but not memorable and the sound level is good.  We were seated with moments of entering the restaurant and drinking water was on the table in less than 1 minute or so and pot of hot tea was dropped soon after the water. We both opted for and enjoyed the hot and sour soup to start our lunch. The egg roll I ordered came out with a nice crisp shell and was steaming hot, the mustard offered on the side has the ability to clear your sinuses so use with caution.   I went with the Hunan Chicken while my mother picked the Empress Chicken. We both asked that our dishes would be prepared \"hot\" and we were not disappointed with the results. There was enough spice to wake up your tastebuds. The only issue we had was the size of the small plates. It was a bit tough trying to keep food on the plate when we started to eat, a bit more unused clear space on the side would help presentation and dinning.  I'm happy to recommend Szechwan Gardens for lunch or dinner. Lunch for two with soup, main dish and hot tea for less than $14 is a bargain considering the taste and quality."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat. I love their spicy hot pot and lamb chop. They also offer this beef wrap that was bigger than other restaurants I've been to. However, they didn't make their xiao long bao. They ordered them frozen and just steam them."}
{"text":"It's a shame that this food is so horrible because the people who work here are so nice.   Orange chicken:  was mostly the skin of the chicken and flavorless.  Spring rolls: SOGGY inside and out  Pot stickers: tasted gross Chow mein: also flavorless Broccoli beef: mediocre  Again, the service was very nice. The food was just severely lacking. For the price we pay I'd expect a lot better."}
{"text":"It's close to authentic and legit Chinese food, but the flavor is still lacking. The place is small and crowded. Speaking mandarin is a plus. One waiter pretends not to speak English well, but she does. She refused to take our order twice. Service is very slow and may take awhile.  The food is ok. I feel super thirsty after having a meal here so that only proves msg is in their food. Try the beef chow fun noodles. Very good and not filled with onions. The other dishes I tried were nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Overall 5 stars. The food was and seemed authentic! And that's what I'm looking for! The menu was both in Chinese and English! You can tell this is a hot spot! Not that busy today but I expect during lunch time it would be busy! Coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Szechwan style restaurant.  On a average Sat evening, the restaurant is pack full of Chinese family.  The service has improved a bit recently.  The first opening months usually has very long wait.  Szechwan restaurant style dishes tend to be spicy and salty on purpose.  Most dishes are medium spicy here.  So if you can take the average Mexican food, you should have no problem here.  Just ask for lots of ice water.  If you don't eat very spicy, there are still many great noodle dishes and dumping dishes."}
{"text":"Third try and it was a disappointment. Took the sizzing rice soup home and doctored it up. The shrimp & lobster sauce  was worse than I make at home. The cashew chicken was fair at best. Sorry this is a BAD example of chinese food. The take-out place up ther street is SO MUCH better!"}
{"text":"Who knew Phoenix had good Chinese food. Super authentic from what I hear but they also have some American Chinese foods such as orange chicken. Everything I had there was fantastic. The bean curd fish as well as the eggplant dish were all delicious. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you're a chilehead like me, then you MUST try this place. These people do spicy food RIGHT! I just got lunch and dinner here, and the Triple Delight I had for lunch ROCKED!  Beef, shrimp, and fish for $6.95  with rice, and soup.   I had heard good things about this place for a while, and now I am kicking myself for not going sooner. This place is my goto Asian food place now. Try them out you'll not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great customer service.  My favorite was the beef with string beans.  Second favorite was the pork dumplings.  Least favorite was the onion pancakes - they reminded me of naan bread or something when I was expecting a fried up onion ring/potato pancake looking thing."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years! The people who work here are familiar as friends!  I like the old fashioned atmosphere, and the excellent service. The food is very very good, and they also have a lengthy vegetarian menu as well.  My personal favorite is the Hunan Chicken with hot and sour soup."}
{"text":"went to there on 29th Jan. The lamb was not fresh and so dont order the lamb pot if you wanna enjoy ur meal, the vegetable was very little and seems like someone ate. for me it is really medium level right here, I mean USA, in China this sort of restaurants would be broke, you know."}
{"text":"This place is located in the back of the shopping strip away from the street view.  You'd never notice it unless someone tells you or you're cutting through the back of the strip.  The place is consistently busy even on weekdays.  The food is spicey but not 5 alarm hot like some mexican restaurants."}
{"text":"Best Chinese on the West Side. Great spot, cozy atmosphere, the best staff ever-- They gave us a New Years/Xmas present!  Vegan menu is out of this world- impresses carnivores alike. We often take out-of-towners here who are vegan/veg-- they beg for more every time they are back (and they are from way more veg-friendly cities!)  I am glad it is NEVER packed, always get a seat right away, but I sorta wish it were packed.... I want them to succeed and make the money they deserve. Heck, I would wait 45 min to be seated...but I am certainly glad I don't have to.   Try the Zen Phoenix Nest. Its my #1 pick. But seriously, every other dish is good.   Random meals come with a fresh cut radish or veg cut flower. Hope you get one!"}
{"text":"Excellent chinese food. Was looking for take-out in Lakewood and happened upon this gem. Isn't the cheapest Chinese food in Lakewood, but well worth it. Fried rice is some of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with 5 coworkers. Nobody liked the food and the atmosphere was horrible. Sat under a TV blaring Chinese news at a table with an off kilter lazy susan that pushed our dishes into our laps.  The staff had to be flagged down several times - to bring forks, to fill water, to ask for the check, etc... I had the orange chicken which was overly wangy with a cloying citrus sauce and large chunks of orange peel that I accidentally chewed on (and spit out) a couple times. yuck. 10 bucks (including tax and tip) for chicken, white rice, diet coke, and a headache. Not going back."}
{"text":"I had the orange chicken. It was very flavorful but should be a little spicier. Very tangy!"}
{"text":"I got the fish fillet in bean sauce. Omg was it so delicious. The fish was cooked to perfection and the spices were just right. It wasnt lobg before they brought my food. Service deserves 5 stars. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Abandon hope all ye who do not like spicy food, because this place will pretty much kill you.  Szechwan Garden specializes in one thing: Hunan-style spicy food.  The walls are red, the place is decorated with peppers, the food is full of peppers... etc.  There is no safe place here - virtually every single dish will nuke the unprepared from orbit with absolutely delicious heat.  I had a variety of dishes and unfortunately forgot the names of the vast majority of them, but I will say everything was good and spicy.  Only one dish - a shrimp dish - didn't have huge chili peppers added.  Everything was amazingly savory and spicy, which basically made it hard to stop eating.  The only negative from this food was the aftermath on my stomach - I literally ate myself until it hurt!  Service is good, but I can tell they are easily overwhelmed.  I suppose this is normal for places with only 5-8 tables.  That being said, be seriously warned - your entire dining party must like spicy food for this place to be a good choice.  If not, you'll be in trouble!"}
{"text":"Authentic.  It's not a place you go to be immersed in beautiful Chinese decor - but it is the place to go if you want to enjoy fresh authentic Szechwan food.    Four of us enjoyed an appetizer plate.  You select from about 10 items at a little bar.  We chose pickled Lotus root, Marinated Cucumber, and Tofu thread.  I loved them - I really really loved them!  The lotus root was fascinating - it tested my chop-stick skills - but I was able to put away my fair share, thank you very much!  We had a pot of hot/sour soup.  It was very good - not too spicy (I would love a bit more) but it was loaded and very fresh.    Main courses - Walnut shrimp - was amazing.  Not over cooked - the shrimp were perfect.  Chong Qing Spicy Chicken (or Chong Qing La Zi Ji) It was a little different than I expected (no sauce) - but easy to eat - very tasty.  Lots of chilies but it's not overwhelming!  It left me with a little \"tingle\" in my mouth!  Next was a pork dish was called Hong Shao Rou or Mao Braized Pork.  Little chunks of fatty pork in an amazing sauce.  Loved in on my rice and scoop up a bit of sauce, rice and a bite of pork.  Fantastic.  If you're not a fan of the fat - you can easily pull the thicker parts off and enjoy ... either way - it's awesome!  (After everyone finished the pot - I grabbed a spoon and pulled out as much of the sauce as I could and ladled it over the rice... O M G...) We also enjoyed a potato dish - Potato and Garlic Oil.  The potato was in threads similar to spaghetti - not raw but not over cooked - you could easily pick it up with your chopsticks.  I loved the flavor and crunch!    The very best thing was the fried green beans.  O M G ... I couldn't get enough of them - cooked perfectly - enough to not be raw - but still leave a bite.  The thin layer of flavored coating was incredible.  We ordered two plates of beans... and two of the shrimp... and two of the chicken.    Don't judge!  It was awesome - and I skipped lunch that day so I deserved it.  Don't miss this place!  Some of the menu items can be a bit off-putting for us that don't have the experience or fortitude to try them - I'm sure they are just as great as the things we did try - but rest assured - you'll find LOTS of items on the menu you'll love!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I tried asking some other Yelpers one morning if they liked this place more than Tao Garden.  I've always liked Tao Garden the most in Chandler area, but the Long John Silvers decore of old was a little too much to handle after a while.  I came to Szechwan Garden with a friend, and I saw the noticeable change in the decor.  It was previously iKitchen (korean/ramen).  iKitchen didn't do much to change the look from the TOGO that was there before them.  Szechwan Garden added touches of red with lanterns.  They changed the tables into the classic round table with red cloth we see at most asian restaurants.  Though there were plenty of free tables, we somehow got stuck with the two seater next to the bathroom.  I wish we could've sat elsewhere, but I assumed they were expecting a massive lunch crowd and didn't want to have wasted seating.. I could deal with that.  Prices were in three tiers: 4.98, 5.98, and 6.98 for their lunch specials that included the entree, soup, and a mini tub of rice.  The distinction between Szechwan Garden and other places is that lunch comes out family style.  You have your own place, there are the entrees in the middle, and you pass around a tub of rice.  It allows sharing of others dishes which you usually wouldn't do.    I was really happy with this too.  I ordered the fillet in black bean sauce with tofu, and my friend ordered the orange chicken.  The orange chicken was tangy, crispy, and not overly deepfriend with a nice underlying orange taste from the zest.  The fillet was hot, tender, not dry, and hot (i know its sad when \"hot\" is a criteria).  My dish also had a nice spice to it from the black pepper, but it wasn't too bad that my friend couldn't eat it.  Service was fast.  Water was refilled often.  I liked this, but then I also thought it was too fast.  By the time our entree was on the table, she already laid the check next to my arm.  They kept repeatedly coming by asking if everything was okay and turning and leaving before I could really answer.  I felt like they wanted us to leave as quickly as possible so they could turn the table.  I don't get it, since there were still plenty of tables open.  Service aside, I would've given the place 5 stars, but the food is too good.  It's definitely my go to spot in Chandler for Chinese from now on."}
{"text":"True Szechwan here! Flavors are outstanding and the dishes true old world. Not dialed down for the American pallet.  Only place in the east valley I have tried that is real Szechwan.  Fast service and hot food. A huge amount of food off the lunch menu which you never see. Don't go if your only love of Chinese food is from PFC's. GO if you are ready to taste some real stuff."}
{"text":"My second visit and both times the food has been great. Its a little pricey but I am obviously a return customer."}
{"text":"2nd visit since new ownership.  Ordered our regular food to go.  The vegetarian noodles tasted like cigarette smoke.  So bad.  Not the same since the other family had the business. I think they have a new cook.  Something is not right.  Saying good bye to our go to Chinese for years.  Sad."}
{"text":"Always have a wonderful szechwan meal at this restaurant. The fried fish fillet and water boiled beef are my go tos and are the best town. I find this place to have better quality food then the other szechwan places in town"}
{"text":"This is a go to restaurant for my family, and has tasty, authentic Szechwan food.  My favorite dish here is the \"Tong Qing Spicy Chicken\", and their \"Fish Filet in Black Bean Sauce\" is another good authentic dish to try. We've been going for a couple of years now, but recently the quality seems to have gone down a bit. Went there today when it was extremely busy, and they didn't have enough servers. Normally I don't mind poor service if a restaurant is busy, but when it leads to sub-par food that's a problem. Our chicken portion was smaller than usual, and our potato dish had too much vinegar."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite Chinese food in AZ. Even though the portion seems like reduced, the flavor beats others."}
{"text":"This was outside my comfort zone for my Americanized pallet for Chinese food but I am so glad I did it. Family style eating. Was so much fun."}
{"text":"It was absolutely packed which is a good sign.  The food was good. 99% of the people in there were asian which is a good sign of the quality or authenticity of the food.  The only annoyance was the girl on the phone told me it was on the SE corner of Ray and Rural and it's on the SW corner so I had some difficulty getting there.  The lo mein was very good. So were the spring rolls."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I always order the spicy fish soup and it is my favorite dish in Chandler. Anytime my family comes to town we go here. The portions are huge so splitting an entree or two is always a great idea. The dumplings are delicious too!!"}
{"text":"Just had my first experience here and it was delicious! Large portions and great flavor. It's also wonderful that they have a vegan menu. We had the Mandarin Eggplant which was outstanding. Definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"Best Szechwan (Sichuan in Mandarin) restaurant in AZ.  Being Chinese and having lived in China for 2 years, this is the real deal.  My family dines at this restaurant almost weekly.   Our favorite dishes are Tong Qing Spicy Chicken, Crispy Onion Pancakes, Hot & Spicy Fish Fillet (aka fish fillet with hot chili peppers), Yu Xiang Rou Si (forgot the English name; it's pork strips with bamboo shoot).  Almost every Szechwanese dish that we have tried is good.  Other non-Szechwanese dishes may not be that great, e.g. beef noodle soup (niu rou mian), little dragon buns (xiao long bao).  My only complaint is the occasional sewage smell outside the restaurant.  I think it's fixed now."}
{"text":"Yes, this is the place to be transported to Szechwan province in China!  Thank goodness for the menu covered in photos as we could not read all the hand written little banners with their dishes hanging on all the walls.  There were 4 tables for 2, 6 tables for 4, and 3 very large round tables.  I noticed my wife and I plus one older gentleman were the only non orientals in the restaurant, and for Sunday noon most of the tables were filled.  All the staff was smiling, friendly and helpful, with the majority speaking very little English, as I initially said \"transported\"! We actually had 2 non spicy dishes out of 3: Steamed Juicy Pork Dumplings.  8 splendid round pockets of dough filled with meat and soup, 6.98;  Honey Walnut Shrimp, with 11 or 12 succulent jumbo shrimp and lots of half walnuts, 11.98; Salt and Pepper Calamari, a huge portion of fried Calamari with dried hot red peppers and slices of very hot green peppers mixed in.  Crunchy salted pieces of tender squid perfectly cooked with delicious heat!  This was a lot of memorable excellent food and we just had no room for anything else :)  Service +++++, environment +++++, staff +++++, value +++++, and taste +++++! Can't wait to return and try other menu items, soon me thinks."}
{"text":"Probably the best, most authentic Chinese food restaurant I have had the pleasure of frequenting.  The servers are very nice and attentive.  The menu can be a bit overwhelming to someone unfamiliar with non-Americanized options, but it's worth the adventure!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome but the service is iffy.  Sometimes it's good and sometimes they treat you like you are something stuck to the bottom of their shoe.  I think it depends on which waiter you get.  Nonetheless, the food is good.  Szechwan Palace over in Phoenix used to be one of my favorite restaurants.  I love spicy foods!  However, the past couple of times the food has been overly salty or not as tasty.  My parents informed me of Szechwan Garden and said I HAD to try it.  Rumor has it that the chef from Szechwan Palace left and opened up Szechwan Garden, but I have no idea whether this is actually true or not.  I must say I definitely was not disappointed.  Excellent flavors and it is much closer too.  I can't say that it tastes exactly like Szechwan Place used to, but it is up to par.  If you go you must order the 'cold platter' trio combo.  Go up to the front display and you can visually pick what you want.  My favorite is the spicy beef tendon.  As for dishes, I recommend the Kung Pao Chicken, very flavorful.  If u can, go for lunch, the dishes are cheaper than dinner and they are still very decently sized.  My parents go here like 3-4X a week and say the hot pot is amazing too, but I have yet to try it."}
{"text":"Kung Pao chicken for daaaaaaays. Real cheap lunch specials with large portions. Dinner entrees are still cheap with even more good food. Oh and get a side of onion pancakes. Trust."}
{"text":"ordered: - mapo tofu - chong qi chicken, boneless - boiled fish - salt and pepper shrimp  pros: - huge portions - awesome price - good flavor on the spices [IMO, the food isn't spicy but creates a nice numbing #mouthfeel. hard 2 describe, you gotta eat it]  cons: - service was fine, but we had to ask for waters to be refilled, which when you're eating spicy food, always feels like an eternity"}
{"text":"First experience was delicious. I got the eggplant and added chicken to it. I love eggplant and this dish did not disappoint. It was in a delicious savory bean sauce  and made spicy as requested. It was slightly oily, but I expected that. The menu, as far as I know, looks pretty authentic. A huge selection of things I never heard of and much of it in Chinese. Of course, there's your more Americanized selections like orange chicken and Kung Pao chicken available for those looking for that. My husband got the orange chicken and it was also delicious. I'm eager to go back and try something else. There was just so much to choose from--various veggie dishes, chicken dishes, pork, seafood, beef, etc. Yum."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was excellent! I had the chicken with broccoli (hot) and an egg roll. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I am so happy to have found a place that is able and willing to serve one of my favorite dishes: salt & pepper tofu. Not only was the server welcoming and friendly, she also suggested long green beans to add to the dish. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned, served with white rice. I look forward to many more meals here, hopefully trying other items on the menu. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Our favorite Chinese place in town, my husband is from Taiwan and vouches for the authenticity of most dishes. I love the Mei Wei La Shanghu (spicy mushroom) and the hot and sour soup is to die for on a cold night. We also order the beef rolls everytime we visit. Go to place for excellent Chinese food at a reasonable price :)"}
{"text":"I've passed by this restaurant a couple times, and it has always been packed full of Chinese families, which is always a good sign.  So, I decided to try it out.    Overall the dishes were pretty good and lean towards the salty side.  Tonight, I had the \"three cold side dishes\" of pork stomach, pig ears, and tofu which were FANTASTIC.  The seasoning was perfect and the pig ears were sliced extra thin.  The second course was no.6 - live fish with peppered bean curd.  This dish was a bit on the fishy side, and while it is definitely cheap for a whole fish ($13), I would not recommend it.  Instead, try the beef noodle soup.  It is very flavorful and the meat is part fatty and part lean, just the way I like it.  It also went well with the pig ear side dish.  Finally I ended the night with the xiao long bao.  The skin was good but the meat filling was average.    Overall the service was good and the waiters were all very nice, especially considering how busy the restaurant was.  It was also a bit loud and cramped inside, but definitely worth a visit for the food."}
{"text":"Great to find another tucked away Szechuan restaurant.  All the old classics are here and executed nicely.  Definitely come for family style ordering.  Not everything has to be made spicy and the kitchen will adjust.  The one thing I'm not always used to (mostly because Cantonese people tend to like light flavors) is the amount of oil used.  I just find myself telling the kitchen to go a little lighter on the oil and I've never had a problem."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on a Sunday night.  Place was empty, although one other table was seated while we were there.  Also, there were quite a few take-out orders being picked up.  Service was attentive, and the food was decent.  My General Tso's came with a bit too much sauce (drowned everything out quickly), but the chicken was fried just right.  Overall, none of the dishes was outstanding, but none of them were bad, either.  It is nice to sit down to a Chinese meal every once in a while, so we just might return when we need a fix."}
{"text":"YUM! I'm usually not a fan of spicy food, but Szechwan Garden is pretty close to be authentic, and the food here is amazing! One of my favourites is the spicy fried chicken pieces. Normally, friend chicken isn't my cup of tea, and if you add in spicy, it's a definite no. However, I ventured out and tried the dish here and loved it. All of the more \"exotic\" or authentic Chinese food is really fantastic food, and those are my favourite. Even though the service is a little slow (I attribute this to the servers not being able to hear because it's a very bustling, rowdy, restaurant), the food is so good that Szechwan Garden deserves its five stars!"}
{"text":"The beef rolls are my main addiction. They're a little pricey, but it spares me from making them myself and they are darn good.   The waitress currently working there is super friendly and remembers me every time I go. I generally eat to-go just because I usually stop by quite late.  I love this place. I don't eat seafood, so maybe I didn't have a crazy reaction like Brother Diarrhea did. It reminds me of several Chinese restaurants in Rowland Heights/San Gabriel. If you're not used to those kind of joints because you're afraid of a little \"added MSG\" or hygiene, go to Panda Express!  If you're in it for a dang good meal, then you've found your place."}
{"text":"This place is closed....found out a month ago. Too bad as the food was good."}
{"text":"So I haven't reviewed anything in a long time but I couldn't resist this post. I ate the chongqi crispy chicken.  1st of all the place reaks outside so I should have walked, from that alone.  They have no air condition and they don't speak English well so it was hard to communicate over the phone initially.    I have eaten chicken all of my life and I know for sure 1000000000% that's not real chicken. It had the consistency of fish like fatty but it surely wasn't the dark meat chicken that they suggested it was.   I want my $$$$$ back! Yuck,  don't waist your time go to magic China noodles the food is fresh and real!"}
{"text":"This is the 7th place for chinese food ive had after moving here from Nebraska a month ago. This is the best of all the places ive had so far. The food variety is authentic but has americanized as well. There staff is very polite and always smiling, food also is cooked very fast. Customr care is an easy 5 stars. The cooking i would rate at a 3.5."}
{"text":"Long wait at lunch. 5 min just to acknowledge I was waiting. Hostess running table tickets, takeout orders and seating tables.  Strange when I'm already eating with chopsticks the server comes over to ask if I want a fork??? WTH? I wonder what kind of reaction I'd get asking a group of Asians eating with forks if they'd like chopsticks?  Ordered beef and broccoli. Tried to substitute fried rice for the steamed rice but no can do. Hint people. Figure out how much additional the same amount of fried rice is and ADD THE ADDITIONAL CHARGE. Telling a customer no you can't do it will ensure one thing: the customer goes somewhere they will. Try visiting other restaurants and see how they do it.  So I got my lunch they way they wanted me to have it. Result? Loss of additional revenue and an unhappy customer. I guess not all business owners actually have business sense.  Two stars only because the food is good. Not great, but good. The service and flexibility to the customer is substandard."}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese restaurant on the West side. The food here is never oily like a lot of Chinese restaurants. I've never had a bad experience here. I'm not vegan but I've sampled about half of the Zen menu and its all good. They are very accommodating here as to the spiciness you desire. Try the Szechuan country soup, the broth is tasty and the veggies are always crispy and fresh."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!!! Honestly the freshest Chinese food. Like others have said- they have ruined Chinese for me. They have raised the bar. Amazing small family restaurant and always attentive and customer focused. Will be back."}
{"text":"!!!Three strikes and Roach Motel!!! My husband and I came here yesterday for lunch. We were offered a table for 2 against the server's station with 1 chair clearly encroaching onto the server's mat. There were at least 3 other open tables, but when I asked to be seated there, the manager told me those were for parties of 4 or more people and that we would have to share the table with other guests if the restaurant got crowded. STRIKE 1! We have only had that happen once on a dinner cruise on Lake Michigan,  never in a restaurant any where else in the world.  Then, I ordered a Diet Coke. What I got did not taste anything like Diet Coke, and believe me, my dscerning taste can tell the difference between a Diet Coke and a Diet Pepsi. When I asked the manager if she had served me a Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi, she told me it was Diet Pepsi. STRIKE 2.  I would think it is common restaurant etiquette to notify customers that they don't carry Coke products and to ask the customer if substitute products are acceptable. The final blow was when, halfway through our lunch, a ROACH crawled into the center of our table. STRIKE 3. I immediately got our waitress to show her the ROACH . She simply stood there staring at the ROACH with her gaping mouth and made no move to do anything. I also went over to the front desk to notify the manager of the ROACH, but she refused to leave the front desk. There was no attempt made by the restaurant staff to address the ROACH, or our discomfort. We were quite distraught by the experience and the staffs' response that we did not have the presence of mind to take a picture of the ROACH. It may have been a good addition to this review and for lodging a complaint at the county Food Sanitation office.  Save yourself from the risk of unsanitary conditions and poor customer service!"}
{"text":"While staying nearby, I looked on Yelp to find somewhere to eat dinner. I read the reviews on this restaurant and happily chose it based on what's here - after having done so, I don't get it... if this is the best chinese Cleveland's got, I feel bad for Cevelanders.  ATMOSPHERE: Creepy.  The decor was what you'd expect, kitchzy oriental complete with the \"year of the___\" paper placemats. What creeped me out was my trip to the bathroom with my children. We had to walk in the back, and along the way passed literally dozens of empty bleach bottles which were littered on the seating booths. What were they doing with all that bleach?!?!?!? It made me think of cleaning up a crime scene! Worse, sitting right next to them, with bleach in HIS booth, was a guy hand making won tons or pot stickers. No gloves, no cover on the table - just him, the dough, the meat, and the bleach bottles. Gross - no won tons for me, thanks.  FOOD: Meh. I have absolutely had way, way better. Where it wasn't terrible, it wasn't great either. We had:  (1) Beef with peapods and water chestnuts. Some of the beef had a slightly sour taste to it, like it was old or maybe worse, going rancid. The peapods were fresh, and the dish tasted like what I'd expect to find on a Chinese buffet at the end of a day.  (2) Orange Beef. This was one weird dish. The beef was almost like meatballs, and had a flavor combination that didn't quite go together. It wasn't horrid, but it wasn't good either.  SERVICE: Typical Chinese restaurant service. We had an asian server, an older woman, and she was okay. She didn't speak a lot of english, so we assume, but she was efficient enough by taking the order and bringing the food. Other than that, she dissapeared.   VALUE: Okay. The prices were very reasonable, but because the food quality wasn't there it made the value for what we got stink."}
{"text":"I moved out of Lakewood, and I still remember my face plastered to the window, eyes welling up with tears at the Last Sight Of Szechuan Garden. Of course, the 45 minute distance is nothing for THE MOST PERFECT CHINESE FOOD EVER; and I still come here constantly.   If you're vegan, you should probably live here. They have an entire \"zen\" menu, with such things as fake chicken, beef, pork, and FISH. I have no idea what those things are made out of, but they are so yummy. If you're like me and don't particularly like incredibly realistic faux-meats, you'll be delighted - things here have nice textures and taste good, but definitely don't taste like actual chicken. The zen \"meats\" tossed with their mouthwatering, perfectly seasoned sauces and presented with flowers carved out of vegetables; and you can see why this is my favourite place ever.  We almost always choose eating in over takeout, and the owners are so, so sweet. They really take the time to get to know you when you're a regular. They make recommendations. They let you specify exactly how spicy you'd like your food (and warn you when you emphatically insist on the spiciest they can make it). They're just very nice people."}
{"text":"I honestly would give negative stars if I could. I was trying to decide what I was gonna get and the waitress came and since I was undecided, she will come get our order later. She had the attitude and not friendly at all. And she never did. My bf had to walk up to the counter and ordered the food. And she was like: That's it? We were 2 so we ordered 2... And after we ate she didn't come back with check so we went up to pay. We ate $18 of food and I was trying to write the tip down. And she showed us how many tips we should give: 20% 25%  Well I know we should appreciate the service but none was provided. But we still gave 10% tip. She said 'what the' and gave us the attitude... Seriously. She is sooooo RUDE!!!!! Horrible customer service!! Never going back and I recommend never going there again"}
{"text":"A friend of mine told me this place recently opened and when we pulled into the plaza, they only had a cloth banner mentioning of a grand opening.  I would love to give this place 4 or 5 stars, but they need to improve on many things before that happens.  Here is what happened. We ordered two beef noodle dishes, but when the order came out, there was only 1. Isn't it a bit obvious that there are X amount of people and there is 1 less entree ordered? It took 3 different waiters/waitresses to get it fixed and by the time I got my bowl, my friends were already done eating.  Shaolin bao's are tasty, but they are a bit overpriced at 8 bao's for $8. We asked the server how many bao's per order, but he didnt know so another server came and said \"8, but am not sure.\" Shouldn't the server know these things?   They shouldn't be so stingy with the ice, our cups literally had like 3 cubes per cup, and when they refilled our water, there was no ice in it at all. When we sat down, when they poured our water, the waiter guy overfilled our cups resulting in water spilled on the floor and splashing onto my feet. It's just water, but still annoying.   In all, the food is pretty good, worth 4 stars. Their service was a 2. Give them a few weeks to work out the kinks and improve their service and I will visit this place again."}
{"text":"Szechwan style is not for the light-hearted. It's spicy! However, for the amount of chilis you see in your entree, it's nowhere as hot as you are led to believe. I do appreciate that they don't go crazy with the whole peppercorns as many Szechwan restaurants do because I don't enjoy the numbing aftertaste.   The prices are very reasonable, especially if you come for the lunch specials. For any person that remotely loves spicy and Chinese food, Szechwan Garden is a must.   Fantastic Dishes: -Fish fillet with hot chili peppers -Shanghai style steamed dumplings -Hot pot with fish and beef"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go, this restaurant has done a great job bringing authentic Szechuan cuisine to Chandler. The prices of their lunch menu have slightly increased over the past couple years, but still a good value. This is a great spot for lunch we always like to get a bunch of different things to try and then we have leftovers for dinner or the next day. The water boil fish is probably my favorite dish. It is very spicy with a lot of dry chili's and chili oil, but tastes really similar to the hot pot I've tried in the Szechuan province of China. Also a great place for vegetarian diners with really tasty veggie options including the fried salt and pepper tofu which is amazing! Will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"Overrated.  This place was so rude, the food was ok, and the prices were a little high for what you get.  Skip this place and go to ACE in Mesa.  Way tastier and ACE is a lot cheaper.  Never going here again."}
{"text":"Ate at the Szechwan Garden for lunch at work recently. Ordered the Orange Chicken and the Stewed Tofu dish. I think relatively speaking the dishes came out \"ok\" however they definitely weren't that great. I think the thing that irked me the most was that they have boba milk tea on the menu and I tried to order it during lunch. The waitress looked at me like I was crazy and abruptly said all they have right now is hot tea. I'm totally ok with someone stating that they are out of something, however to look at me with an angry distasteful look doesn't really create a good customer service atmosphere.   I would say given their price and speed of service they're ok, however I will likely not return due to the customer service and the fact that the food wasn't that great (plenty of other places nearby that are just as good if not better)."}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise!!!   It said vegetarian on the door, but I wasn't expecting vegan beef, vegan chicken, vegan shrimp, vegan fish, vegan scallops -- make a vegan HAPPY why don't you!? :D   (Yes, meat eaters - they take care of you, too.)   I'm just so excited, Lakewood is definitely holding it's own for the vegan crowd.   I had a crispy, spicy tofu and veggie dish as well as an asparagus tofu soup. Super nice portions, I'll be having the rest for dinner. As my server said, \"No cooking tonight! You can just watch tv and eat!\"  I already can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We had the eggplant in garlic sauce, stir fried beans, spicy tofu, spring onions pancake and spring rolls... all.vegetarian meal. It was delicious!!  The service was very slow but we were talking so didnt care much for it.   Definately recommend it."}
{"text":"Discovered in a post-workout drive by, this place turned out to be quite alright. Not the white cloth napkin paradise where you come to experience an atmosphere of fine dining, but reasonably priced Chinese deliciousness sizzling on your very generously portioned plate. Actually I almost left because I smelled bleach on the entrance (we came near closing time) very distinctly but  then I heard my friend exclaim: \" Hey! They have $3 wine!\"  and it convinced me to stay. Why not five stars? Well despite the deliciousness (super fresh button mushrooms, amazing veggies, beef melting in your mouth and very succulent shrimp), the service was iffy. Even though very entertaining.  When the waitress was picking up our plates, she remarked : \" Oh wow! You ate everything???\" Which made us feel like these fat cows who shamelessly devoured all the food left for orphans and wounded soldiers. We immediately felt guilty and self-conscious, I was almost imagining my fortune cookie saying: \" Someone will never fit in their skinny jeans circa 2006.\"  And when we asked her ( in advance) for separate checks, she looked shocked, scolded us with a look : \" Wow! There is no love at this table!\" followed  by a deep sigh and asking the other waitress to help you split up our checks.  I mean is it not too common for two working girls pay separately? But I figured since prices were from 2001, service must have been from 1965. But in the end none of this matters  - I am capable of forgiving you everything as long as you serve me the best button mushrooms in the hood."}
{"text":"4 stars? Are you kidding? This is the grossest restaurant in the entire planet!  My brother had severe food poisoning after eating Shrimp Fried Eggs here (Xia Ren Chao Dan). The shrimps must have been toxic and the eggs were not fresh at all. He was throwing up the night after eating this crap here, and then continuously puking and suffering from severe diarrhea day after day, night after night, even fainted a few times. This lasted a few days. He had never been this violently sick in his whole life.   The reviews are so inflated here... I'd say that the level of hygiene in this restaurant is highly questionable, if not downright appalling. I'd recommend that you go elsewhere for your meals unless you want to risk being poisoned by unknown toxins hidden in their dishes. Stay away!!!"}
{"text":"Who knew little ol' Phoenix - let alone a suburb of Chandler - would have more than all encompassing \"Chinese\" restaurants. As one to love spicy Asian foods, I was thrilled to find a Sichuan restaurant just right in the midst our neighborhood.  For my first time here, I decided to go with the staples: water boiled fish, Chongquing chicken, mapo tofu and threw in some scallion pancakes.  The food came out fast, yet freshly cooked and bubbling. All dishes were fairly flavorful...I wouldn't say the best Sichuan food I've ever eaten, but it still imparts your palate with that familiar, pleasant citrus tingly taste that I crave. I enjoyed both the fish and chicken, but the mapo tofu was very lacking uniqueness. And you can't go wrong with fresh scallion pancakes.  Service here is what I would expect. Flag the server down for anything you need, don't be surprised if you're reminding them a few times to refill water, but overall it's not the worst. When the food is good enough, service is only secondary. Overall, not bad Sichuan restaurant, and I definitely look forward to exploring more dishes here!"}
{"text":"Not the best Chinese I've ever had but pretty darn good.   Reminds me of a Chinatown restaurant in Manhattan.   Authentic food and friendly service."}
{"text":"We have been going here for years. I loved the food when I ate meat, and now that we try to avoid it, we have discovered their Zen menu. I was hesitant to try it after reading some reviews, but my fears were quickly crushed when I tried the orange chikn and general tso's. Absolutely amazing. Apparently their Zen menu is most of their business. I can see why! I am an even bigger fan now."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service. They took time to explain things on the menu when we had questions. I would definitely go back. And if you are an adventurous eater there are plenty of interesting menu items."}
{"text":"Checked out this place. Have been a fan of Szechuan food since living in Chicago and frequenting Lao Sze Chuan (sp?). Got my usual Chong qi chicken and boiled fish. Both very spicy dishes.  Generous lunch size portions and great price. I think they must have a lunch price different than dinner price.  Total cost of both was $22. Was spicy with tingly tongue feeling from Szechuan peppercorns. Really good flavor.  Not a big fan of all the tiny little bones in the chicken but good amount of chicken to chili ratio. Will be back if I'm ever back in this area again.   Service was fine, nothing fancy but fancy is not needed with me as long as the food is good.  Enough room for larger parties of 6-8 as well."}
{"text":"Vegan squid rolls are the best thing in the world. It's hard to try another appetizer, but i'm sure they are all as good.  best vegan menu around. so many options!  i wish they opened before 4 on sundays. also, if they delivered, i would give them 5 stars in a second. We would probably order from them 3-4 times a week."}
{"text":"Let me say first that I grew up in Singapore with some of the most wonderful chinese food in the world. But having lived and dined in the US now for more than a decade I've learn to have a very different expectation when sampling chinese cuisine in the US. On with the review. After reading 3 reviews here, I thought I give the Szechwan Garden lunch a try today. We had the Spring rolls, Fried Noodle with shrimp and Fried Rice with Pork. The spring rolls looks to me like they were made at the restaurant which is always a plus for me. The main dishes were ok. Nothing to write home about (is Yelp home?).  I'll have to go back to try the other dishes and update this review."}
{"text":"It was great to see another szchewan style restaurant open up in the valley. The staff is awesome and the food is the best in the valley.  However, the guests are terrible. The guests are very demanding. I speak some chinese so I was able to pick up on a conversation when a group of 5 arrived who were also impatient to wait for a seat. They had asked the boss if people could be moved (who were already eating)  so they could occupy a group table. The managers gave in and asked people to move to another table. Some of the guests here can be real arrogant from time to time. I just wanted to smack those guests in the face."}
{"text":"Been here more than a handful of times and I love their szchewan dishes! Some dishes I always get at szchewan places are spicy water boiled fish(shui zhu yu pian), yu xiang eggplant, fu qi fei pian (it's a plate of three different items you can choose from the front counter and I'd recommend the pig ear, the beef, and kidney), and usually get the garlic string beans as well. For those of you who feel numbness or tingling in your mouth, that would be due to Chinese peppercorn which is what szchewan cuisine is known for!   The food is consistently very good but the service can be lacking at times. (Went for lunch and had to fill the water ourselves). If you're looking for authentic szchewan food though, stop on by!"}
{"text":"A very solid choice if you're looking for the staples as well as a few unique dishes. We order take-out every few weeks and have loved everything. The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars is because the decor is a little dated, but not bad if you do dine in.   The service is always friendly and quick-typically 20 min or so.   Some of my favorite dishes include the fried noodles, tofu and green beans, sesame chicken, Beautiful four seasons (which is literally 4 different dishes packed separately for only $15ish), and the apps of course- Rangoon's, dumplings, and wonton soup.   They also have a coupon online that you just need to mention, $5 off $35.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food. Good service. The waitress/owner helped us with our selections. We especially liked the Walnut Shrimp, hot and sour soup and noodles. We had two children with us so they gave us a round table away from other customers. It was a quiet, excellent corner for us and the round table was perfect for six adults. This will be our new go to Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"Great authentic chinese food. Service is not the best but the food is too good!!"}
{"text":"Service was a  little slow. The food made up for it.  I ordered a chicken dish and it was the best I have eaten since China Town in San Francisco.  While is is a little pricey it was worth the treat. Even had enough left for later.   It is busy for a reason. That is why you should try it"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the honey walnut shrimp and beef with string beans. Dinner prices are a little on the higher end but the they have great lunch specials. Usually gets pretty crowded during the dinner hours."}
{"text":"The service here is good, they kept our water full and even offered extra white rice. The food itself was... Bland? My wife and I both got chicken dishes. Hers was not good, mine just tasted like unseasoned deep fried chicken. We both ate my order, she took hers home to add some Sriracha. Nothing against the place, we didn't have a \"bad experience\", the food just isn't good."}
{"text":"The service is really great. They are very attentive and friendly. The food was decent here. They do not add the spicy Szechuan chili that makes your tongue feel numb. It made it more edible for me and I was not suffering as much. There was a really good fried chicken spicy dish we got that was really good."}
{"text":"Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. That pretty much sums up my experience.   Oh, and they have a vegan menu.  Dropped in on a Saturday night. The place was freezing and semi-crowded. All of the wait staff were bundled up and the space heaters that were scattered throughout the dining room just couldn't keep up with the draft from the window and the door opening.  I started with vegan fried chicken. It was ok. Deep fried seitan on a stick. My meat eating companions got wontons and thought they were alright.  I ordered vegan chicken in a garlic sauce. Not sure what was actually in the sauce but it tasted bland and almost burnt. Had I not been starving, I wouldn't have eaten it. My mom ordered vegan sweet and sour chicken. Sweet and sour sauce on deep fried fake meat is never really awful, so she enjoyed her meal. My mom's boyfriend got fried duck and it was too fried and very crispy. Again, almost burnt. My boyfriend got real sweet and sour chicken and said he's had better meals just about everywhere else we've been to.  This was a major letdown. I appreciate that they have vegan options, but...if they're not good, why bother?"}
{"text":"Came here to order takeout with my family due to the Thai place across the way being closed earlier than posted (shame, shame). So our business went to Szechwan Garden!  I had a hankering for orange chicken so that's exactly what I ordered. The portion was large and the flavor was great! Just wish the chicken was a little fluffier, like Panda's but without all the chemical junk. Aside from the slight dryness/skinniness of the chicken strips though, the meal was spot on! And plus the large portion kinda compensates so it works out. I will definitely consider returning when I'm in the mood for Chinese again."}
{"text":"I've lived in Lakewood for more than 6 years and this is by far the BEST Chinese restaurant around. Their vegetarian Mandarin Eggplant is a staple of our whole family (including my vegetarian sister) and my husband and I love their Kung Pao Chicken, egg rolls and steamed dumplings. We frequently go here for family birthdays and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Ordered two items and received one rice. One item wasn't even what was ordered and the restaurant expects the customer to drive all the way back to the restaurant to handle it. Asked for a reversal on my credit card transaction, but employee was unwilling to do so."}
{"text":"Thumbs down! My cowroker told me about this place & I had very high hopes. Wonton soup inedible-broth was brown & nasty. Fried rice hardly had any good veggies or pork in it. I LOVE Chinese food but I was very disappointed in this restaurant."}
{"text":"If you like spicy food this is the right place to go to. The lunch menu is an extremely good deal!! Cheap!! The only downside is that the food taste is not always consistent."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I am begging the owner to please print some of the specials in English."}
{"text":"Thought this place was great. Very friendly, Great Food....hint try the braised spicy frog if your on the adventurous side."}
{"text":"Your taste buds will tingle at Szechuan Garden, both from the great flavors, and from the spiciness of the food!  We attempted to eat here on a Friday night, but it was packed to the gills, with several people waiting outside for a table to open up.  We decided to eat somewhere else, and come back again for lunch.  The lunch specials are a very good deal.  They come with a very good portion of main dish, with rice and soup.  Prices will range from $5-7 depending on what \"tier\" you order from.  I had #19, the \"Fish fillet with hot chili peppers).  Although I've had spicier and bolder tasting versions of this dish, this version wasn't so spicy that it left a weird aftertaste as I ate more, which I appreciated.  Also, the lowered heat level allowed more of the flavor of the spicy peppercorns and chilies to show through, and occasionally I'd get a hit of some fragrant whole peppercorn as I chewed.  The spicy bold broth was a good contrast to the delicate texture and mild flavor of the fish.  In addition to fish, there were bean sprouts and napa cabbage in the dish, with a sprig of cilantro on top.  The only slight negative, which is probably more of a syndrome regarding the dish itself rather than the kitchen's preparation, is that it is a very unctuous broth, layered with a copious amount of chili oil.  I also tried some \"Shredded pork with hot garlic onion\".  It was also a good portion, with tender pork and a salty, slightly pungent flavor.  Service was good, and drinks were refilled as needed.  It helps if you speak Mandarin here, and they do have specials on the wall, but they are written in Chinese.  This is definitely a new favorite for spicy authentic Chinese food!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Love the Eggplant with Garlic. Order for pick up during lunch is recommended."}
{"text":"Very bland and rubbery shrimp.  Crab Rangoon tasted like sugar and cream cheese, not like crab.  Hunan beef was like boiled meat and vegetables, totally tasteless and uneatable.  Takeout was packaged in a cheap styrofoam tray that immediately spilled everywhere.  Spent $30 and literally ended throwing it away because it was such garbage.  Microwaved a trader joes Indian chicken and ate that, it was 20x better than what they are serving here."}
{"text":"Firstly let me start by putting it this way - if you count calories or always religiously eat healthy or are on a diet or despise oily food, this place is not for you or you can redeem it on your cheat day. I love their spicy chicken/fish in chilli sauce. Probably they can replace the name with chilli oil instead of sauce. Sichuan peppers and chili oil just entice your taste buds. Perfect for a person with nose congestion ;) Another item which is irresistible is qong qi boneless chicken. It's like spicy popcorn chicken with Sichuan peppers and red chillies. You can't stop with just one. Spicy fantastic delicious guilty food :D"}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood find! Pleasant surroundings and a huge menu with some pretty wild stuff. Nice servers who explain everything.the shanghai dumplings were as good as any in SF's Chinatown, and the shredded pork with onion sauce was a new delight for us. It'll be a standby in this house!"}
{"text":"I've tried MaPo Tofu in many restaurants and this one is by far the best. It has just enough spice without being too spicy to enjoy. The texture of the tofu is perfect and the sauce is powerful but not overwhelming.   The pan fried green beans are crispy and flavorful but are cooked with ground meat so if you're a vegetarian, ask for the green beans without the ground meat.   I wasn't a fan of the hot and sour soup nor the tomato egg flower soup which is why I deducted one star.   Their fried rice is flavorful and addictive.   Service is prompt and efficient though not overly friendly. I've dined in and taken out and the quality is the same. One of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese-American food! Clean, tasty, probably the best on the west side of Cleveland. Still, it is Chinese... not really missing anything by passing it up. However, if the urge hits for a little taste of the orient, Szechuan is a great choice!"}
{"text":"This place deserves no stars if I could. I've read some of the yelp reviews and based on the feedback I thought it would be worth the try. Bad idea, I was soooooooo dissapointed. I ordered the orange chicken and husband ordered Kung  Pao Chicken. The chicken didn't even taste  like real meat. Not sure what the hype is about this place but I'll pass. I will never eat here again!"}
{"text":"Quick question... Is this restaurant still open? I have been calling for the past week, and there has been no answer. I really enjoy this place."}
{"text":"From what I know the Chef from Szechwan Palace left to open Szechwan Garden -- talk about a punch in the gut!  Pow!  The food here is pretty authentic and tasty.  Very spicy I might add so if you're a lightweight please step aside.   We ordered the Mapo Tofu, Fried Green beans, some sort of fried rice noodles that was dipped in a brown sauce (I didn't order this one my friend did so I don't know what it's called haha) Finally, my favorite fried Frog Legs in a medley of vegetables - Yum!  It was my favorite of them all.  Frog Legs are small but very meaty.  Plus, the spice they cooked it in was delicious!   Service was pretty good since my friend was a regular and I think they know her by name.  Oh the perks!  What I like about this place is that it reminds me of those old Chinese restaurants back in LA.  No uniforms and the staff ate their lunch next to us :)  The decors could use a modern touch, but the tackier the better I guess - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I come here a lot, either to get take out by myself or entertain my chinese family when they come into town. When I am by myself, I go straight for the cold dishes display where you get to choose 3 items. This display has cold smoked chicken, spicy chicken, pig ear, eggplant, seaweed salad, various bean curds, cucumbers and so something different every time.  This place is authentic as it gets, with special dishes available to only those who can read the chinese writings hanging on the walls. This includes my parents' favorite pork liver (I can't vouch for how good that is). I love the water fish, twice cooked pork, and mapo tofu."}
{"text":"Absolute waste of money. Disposed of 90 percent of our meal. Fried rice had almost no meat and veggies. Kung Pao and General Tsos chicken was soggy. Wonton broth was pretty much hot water."}
{"text":"Braised spicy frog in hot pot and lamb in cumin sauce were outstanding. Wonderful staff; ambience was excellent. Thank you!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for orange chicken, kung pao chicken with fried rice - stop reading now!! Turn around and go back to Panda Express.  If you're looking for authentic and flavorful Chinese food, you found your place.  Being Chinese, I can honestly say, I know the difference between good Chinese food and Americanized Chinese food. Moreover, both of my parents loved this place. After my mom passed, my father came here nearly every other day to get food. If that's not a vote of authenticity, I'm not sure what else is.   Onto the food! It's flavorful, filling and if you're willing to try new things, you may find your new favorite dish. I personally can't start a real Chinese restaurant experience without a bowl of hot and sour soup. Their ??? has the right amount of heat and tartness. I always add in a dash of white pepper to kick it up a bit.  The eggplant is a hit if you're eating with Chinese food newbies. I believe they have two kinds. Ask for the one with wood ear... trust me.   Service! If you don't speak Chinese, please, for all that is good and holy, BE POLITE AND PATIENT. Don't get your panties in a bunch of the Chinese (and very sweet) servers take awhile to understand that you really can't have anything with gluten. You think they were taught \"gluten\" in their night classes? Hell, do YOU even know what gluten is? But I digress...   This place is awesome and again, authentic. So please take it for what it is. Enjoy the Chinese TV and trust me, loud slurping is a total compliment."}
{"text":"My husband and I were so looking forward to having some good Chinese take-out.  I looked on yelp.com and found in Lakewood, Ohio the best rated Chinese restaurant (we're visiting from So. Cal.), which was Szechuan Garden.  We got the Seafood Delight, Chicken with Garlic, rice, an egg roll, and a mixed vegetable dish.   We were so disappointed!  Nothing was very good and the dishes all mostly looked alike and tasted the same as well!  The broccoli was old and wasn't good, the green peppers tasted off, and all the vegetables in every dish were the same, and none were great.  Even the rice was just fair.   The seafood was pretty good.  The best part were the fortune cookies which were made elsewhere and sealed!   So sorry but this is the truth and I hate to spend $31 on lousy food  (we got $5 off or it would have been $36)."}
{"text":"Amazing flavors, lots of good spice, inexpensive. Great place, will definitely frequent!"}
{"text":"I've been to Sichuan and this is the closest authentic food we've found here in the valley. We love coming in and getting the cold plate to start with the cucumbers, tofu and sliced pig ears (yes you read that right). Then we usually get the stir fried green beans and Shanghai style dumplings. Today we also ordered the ma po tofu - soooo good! Not so spicy that we couldn't eat it, it was just right. They have tons of Chinese hand written signs around the dining room advertising the specials so next time, we're going to ask what some of them are. They are usually the ones that are truly good!"}
{"text":"If you love spicy Chi see food, this is the place to go. Their Chongki mini hotpot is great. Make sure to order extra noodles. Generally, great food. Their service needs improvement but their food quality makes up for it."}
{"text":"The decor was interesting. I didn't like that they didn't have coffee, but it was really intimate and the price was reasonable, so I would recommend it for a change. The white rice was good."}
{"text":"This is the place to go if you want friendly, quick service with a smile!  They let you know you are an important customer, answering any questions you have about the menu.  They are also very attentive once you have ordered, refilling water as soon as you need more, and asking if you need anything else.  I came for General Tso Chicken, and the taste was spot on.  The portion was generous for a reasonable price.  The only downside was that really thick breading that I'm not a fan of.  I will go back to try other items on their menu because of everything else being excellent."}
{"text":"I feel as though this place needs a little more love.  First of all, its nice to go to a Chinese restaurant that specializes in Szechuan food.  If you haven't had food from this region of China, it kind of like comfort food.  It tends to be spicy and, yes, a little oily some times.  Most of the spicy dishes are also complimented by the nice floral flavor of ash berry, also know as Szechuan peppercorn.  Some people have complained about oil but when I have not ordered the spicy and hot, the food has been less oily than most places.  Everything I have tried, I have enjoyed."}
{"text":"I love it when Chinese food is NOT GREASY!  As much as I love Chinese food sometimes it is super greasy and wrecks my stomach.  Szechuan Garden offers nice, clean, NOT GREASY, Chinese food, and it is absolutely delicious.  Good service, great prices, what more can  you ask for?  GO HAVE DINNER!"}
{"text":"This place is a lakewood classic. Been going here since I was a little kid. I've got a pretty good understanding of Asian food. I was stationed in Korea for a year when I was in the army in 2nd infantry division. So I'm not totally ignorant when it comes to Asian, & I believe this place is better then any Chinese (not Korean or Vietnamese) restaurant in Asiatown or whatever. On top of that they also have vegan options if your trying to cleanse your soul. Also they have the good hot brown mustard, which a lot of Americanized Chinese restaurants do not have. They have been here forever so they must be doing something right. Your wak if you don't like this place or have really unreasonable expectations."}
{"text":"Great food but service suck. The waitress literally came out and chase us for the tips when I left it on the table aleeady"}
{"text":"Best szechwan I've ever had. I went on a Friday evening and it was incredibly busy. All the customers who were eating in were Asian, which is great sign. I ordered the lamb skewers to go, and was not disappointed! The lamb was cooked perfectly, and was spiced extra spicy like I requested :) My only suggestion is, do not walk in to order take out on a busy night (the weekends). They were backed up on to go orders and the wait was pretty long, but definitely worth it!!! I will be eating there again tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Getting worse and worse. Terrible service and less guest than before. This place is going down."}
{"text":"I had the twice cooked pork and it was amazing. Pretty close to the Sichuan style. :)"}
{"text":"Szechuan Garden (SG) has ruined Chinese take-out for me.  You wouldn't give SG a second chance when seeing it from the outside.  It is in a location that looks like it would feature a laundromat rather than a hidden, Asian treasure.  The menu is extensive and features many fantastic vegan options.  This is a very eaters friendly place.  The portions are huge and presented beautifully (if you're eating in).  They also offer take-out.  I can't say enough about how much better this food is than most Chinese food I have eaten in restaurants before.  Their prices are just a hair more expensive than I would hope, but the portions and quality are definitely worth it.  Take a look at their website.  They have a menu that you can flip the pages of!  Way fun.  Yes, I am easily amused...  http://www.szechwan-garden.com/"}
{"text":"Almost the best Chinese restaurant that Id ever have in Tempe/Chandler area. Needless to say almost all their dishes are amazing. Serving is good, quick response. The best dishes I like is water boiling fish. It's not spicy at all. People can not take spicy food like me can actually fall in love with this dish! Tons of dishes that I haven't try yet. But I think those are all good to taste! 100% recommended!"}
{"text":"This service here was really slow & our waitress didn't speak much English. We had to repeat ourselves multiple times for her to understand us.  I found this place on Yelp, of course. We had to go to the front to tell them we were ready to order after waiting about 15 mins after we sat down to order food.  We order the Spicy shrimp in the hot pot, dumplings and beef and tofu hot pot. The shrimp wasn't bad, but it was a little dry. The beef was a bit soft and chewy, the tasted way better than the beef. Lastly the dumplings were juicy and tasty, I would recommend those.  The food was horrible, but it wasn't great. I most likely will not come back here."}
{"text":"It's definitely better than average Chinese food in this town and pretty reasonable.  Ordered the shredded pork dish which was great.  The Shrimp and Beef Chow Fun which was delicious.  Then we got the popcorn spicy fried chicken. Which is basically like a big popcorn chicken looking dish but with an absolute TON of dried peppers cut and put on top. The problem with this dish is the peppers are the dry type. So they don't let them sit in ice water for awhile before tossing them in so it's like biting into a piece of plastic. Not fun. Also NOT spicy. There was a ton of them. Makes the dish unenjoyable.  We will definitely go back and try other things. Skip the fried chicken.  Also skip the Spring rolls. Frozen little gross ones."}
{"text":"I have been going to Szechuan Garden for 25 years.  I always get the same thing:  Beef with Broccoli and Shrimp Fried Rice.  I have never been disappointed.  It's a little bit more expensive than all those store front Chinese restaurants, but well worth the extra money.  I wish the parking situation was better, but a small annoyance for great Chinese food."}
{"text":"I literally tried and tried to think of something I could dock a star for on this place and honestly, I can't. It's quaint, homey and has the feel of a true Chinese hole-in-the-wall. When I walked in, I was the only customer in there, which worried me, but I also realized that it was that in between \"off-time\" when it's not really lunch anymore but not quite dinner time yet (I went at 3:30). That changed drastically as by the time I left, it was about 3/4 full and everybody but me was speaking Mandarin. You know a place is good when the nationals are in there eating. The place is very clean (although I didn't visit the restroom) and right off the bat, the service was very good, and remained that way throughout my stay. My meal was very simple. I was battling a cold at the time so I figured a good, spicy soup type dish was in order. I ordered the seafood soup with dan dan noodles and asked them to make it spicy. The bowl was enormous and I thought, \"I'll never eat all this,\" but boy was it good! I polished that bowl off and even surprised myself. The bowl was $10 and I had water, so most definitely well worth it. 2 thumbs up and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Our go to chinese place. Not a fan of taste bud numbing Sichuan peppers but they can take those out for you from any dish, and still make the dish spicy (with chilli peppers instead)  Ingredients are fresh, especially fish. Never had a bad meal here but if it involves their fish in black bean sauce it's a whole lot more delicious!  Service can be spotty and decor is cozy at best but the food speaks for itself. Always a good sign."}
{"text":"The lady refused to substitute fried rice instead of white rice. I have never encountered a Chinese restaurant that wouldn't sell fried rice even though it is on their menu. I hope they will improve their service. Maybe she just misunderstood due to her language, but it is unacceptable not to allow a customer to order what they want. The food was inferior than other Chinese restaurants. I will go elsewhere. I hope to try them in the future if they improve but staying away for now."}
{"text":"The food has always been good.  The service...so so. It seems like the prices are going up and portions getting smaller (lunch and dinner).  If you have a to-go order, they give you a small portion of rice and get mad if you request more.  If you dine in, you get all the rice you want.  Doesn't make sense."}
{"text":"I had the hankering for some good old \"American\" style Chinese food. Not something crazy exotic, not  something authentic or even particularly healthy. Just some classics like kung pao chicken, fried rice, sesame chicken etc. And boy did SG fit the bill. The food was great, the wait staff attentive, the portions large, and the prices what you'd expect.  Plus, the kicker- they have sizzling rice soup which is surprisingly hard to find and insanely pleasing. Highly recommend you start with that and double time in winter.  The food and decor were at the same time familiar and comfortable. This has become our \"I just want Chinese food\" go-to and I'm so glad we found it."}
{"text":"This was my favorite Chinese food place. My family has been ordering take-out and dining in the restaurant for years. I won't eat at any other Chinese place around Lakewood. Every item I have ever ordered has been good and that is going on a 20 or so year run. I cannot say enough about the service. It is a family run establishment that values its customers. The vegan options from the \"Zen\" menu are tasty. I really recommend this place. I hope you go there and enjoy it as much as I do!"}
{"text":"I liked the chow fun and the duck! Need a bigger size soda like a 20oz. Instead of a 12oz. Can"}
{"text":"Tried a couple of times now and was heavily disappointed on visit #2. Got the frog legs, fish in chili oil, beef noodle soup, some fried rice and beef roll. Frog and fish were same seasoning - just salty. Beef noodle soup was eh. Don't remember beef roll. Fried rice was maybe the best of it all which is sad....  It was really busy though on a Saturday night but I won't be a part of that crowd in the future."}
{"text":"Nobody came to take the order 10min after we sat down. The Mao's pork they served was cold."}
{"text":"For Chandler this is a really good location for Szechuan food. I love their cold entries where you can go to the display and choose 3 for $6. I usually get the \"Fuqi Feipian\" and the beef tenders and any other dish. This with some rice is  good for lunch and some.   Finally a place to get my \"Ma La\" fix."}
{"text":"I was super impressed with Szechwan Garden! I came here for lunch with a couple coworkers and the place was packed, but we were seated quickly. We ordered the saut√©ed green beans, the spicy pork lunch special, the chow fun, Xiao long bao, and scallion pancakes. I wanted to come here specifically for XLB, and they did not disappoint. They were a little on the big side, but not too big to eat all in one bite. My only issue with them were that they didn't bring any sauce for them and then kinda disappeared so we couldn't get any..... I think this may have been more of a product of their busy -ness than what is typical. Anyway, the xlb were juicy and delicious. I would come back for that alone. The rest of the food was also tasty, with the green beans being the best item - they were spicy and garlicky and delicious. The chow fun was good, but forgettable, the pork was also tasty. We ate a ton of food and still only paid abut 10$ per person. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Deliocious and very generous portions! Very fast and friendly. Ordered the Sizzling Beef platter, chicken fried rice and spring roll. Ordered the egg flower soup minus the tomato and it was very tasty. The service was fast, couldnt believe it."}
{"text":"Very very good! We ordered sweet n sour chicken and the sauce was great, lots of pineapple and green pepper too. Also had beef with broccoli and the meat was tender and the broccoli was fresh and crisp. I love that they offer brown rice too. Totally recommend!"}
{"text":"I am from the San Gabriel Valley in So Cal, which has countless options for great Chinese food. This restaurant is the best Szechwan I have found since moving to the East Valley."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese place in Northeast Ohio. My partner and I have loved it since the 90s. A few years ago, they added an extensive vegan menu, and since we're vegans, that's an extra added attraction. Wonderful dishes, friendly and attentive service and a cozy and casual atmosphere. I don't know what's up with the unfinished plywood hanging awning-like atop the tiny strip center's storefronts -- I think the wood has been slowly rotting away for several years now, looking like a renovation project gone bust. But don't let that keep you from going inside and enjoying the fresh pleasures of this Cleveland gem.  Update: We revisited SG yesterday for dinner. Little has changed since we were last there four years ago, other than a freshening of the storefront. It's still NEO's best Chinese restaurant. We could kick ourselves for staying away for so long. Although they were closed for at least a year, so I think it was just an \"out of sight, out of mind\" kind of thing. Anyway, I can't wait to go back again. We will surely become regulars again."}
{"text":"I took my family here recently was very good. Even my picky son ate a lot. Bf also ate until he hurt. I love spicy and I loved my food. Already craving!!!"}
{"text":"Their food is very tasty for a decent price. If you enjoy spicy cuisines, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Loved the food. Quick delivery. Authentic chinese. Must try soupy dumplins. Price is ok."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday night with two other friends. We were seated right away (6pm before the dinner rush) and ordered drinks.   The menu is pretty extraordinary. Myself being Chinese American; the food options and variety was great even though we stuck to the basics. We ordered the beef chow fun, beef with broccoli, pork and cabbage dumplings, and another dish I cannot remember the name of.   The food came out promptly, steaming and served with white rice family style. The large portions were plenty for the three of us with leftovers to spare.  The only downside was it took quite a bit for the check. We didn't mind too much as we were enjoying each other's company but service could be better.   Overall it was a great experience with great food."}
{"text":"We get carry out almost once a week. No other Chinese takeout compares. It is fresh, not as greasy as some Chinese food can be. My wife and I are only half kidding when we say that where spend our retirement years will depend on access to chinese food we like as much as Szechuan Garden."}
{"text":"I'll start with the worst part... We saw they had xiao long bao  which is a soup filled dumpling, and were so excited to order and eat them. When made correctly, it's delicious and juicy and amazing. The server said that they take longer to make and we were ok with that. About half an hour later they came out and they looked so sad and flat. All of the soup had spilled out before they even cooked it and it tasted like day old dumplings that were just reheated (look at the picture I posted of the sad and unappetizing xiao long bao). We also ordered the twice cooked pork which was pretty good, we would definitely order it again. We also ordered mapo tofu which was not good. It didn't taste like the mapo tofu you would normally find at a Chinese restaurant. We ordered the chongquin chicken which was like battered popcorn chicken saut√©ed in peppers and it definitely didn't taste like the delicious chongquin chicken we've had at Szechuan palace on 44th and McDowell. The server was really nice, she was an older lady and helped us order the popular tasty dishes she recommended. We did have to wait for a really long time to get someone's attention to get our check and pay."}
{"text":"Only had their food once... my friend brought it to me \"to go\" amazing... really ... cold dishes ? am i really stuck in PHX, or did someone teleport me to real chinese food again?  i live in the bay area, and miss this so badly... personally love the Happy Couple ... fuqi feipian! just wish i could have a vegetarian version!!! ha ha.."}
{"text":"First let me say Xi√®xi√® for the wonderful meal. Lamb kabobs were spicy and tasty, pork dumplings were juicy and full of flavor and the spicy chicken (hot as they also serve it in cold sauce) had tons of flavor and was just the right amount of heat. Next time I'll have to get more than (2) orders of the dumplings as they went quick with everyone wanting more. Great customer service and quick for takeout."}
{"text":"Arrived at 6:52 pm on a Friday and the place is packed - a server catches my eye sees it's only one person and finds a little hidden table and seats me - grabs me a cold water and a menu - within 5 minutes another server takes my order chicken with hot garlic sauce - been here maybe 5 minutes -  very few Caucasian people mostly Asian people and everyone is eating at light speed - 701pm been here 9 minutes and I'm eating - excellent taste - piping hot - nice portion $9 for full dinner - value is great - I'm right next to a little wait station - no matter what you need silverware or napkins or chopsticks or a to go box of any size the station is centrally located and everyone seems to know they're free to take whatever they need to increase their dining experience - minutes - got up to take a picture of the station and the waitress raced over to ensure I found what I was looking for - 717 pm stuffed and on my way out 9.71 with tax 5 stars in 16 minutes"}
{"text":"You know you are at an authentic Chinese restaurant when you see lots of signature dishes written in Chinese hanging on the wall and almost all customers are speaking in their native tongue.  Service: The kitchen was super busy cooking food for customers who were dining in as well as keeping up with the to-go order. Servers were trying their best to serve food as quickly as they could, checked up on orders and super polite to all customers. All of them speak little to no English, but I admire their hard working ethnic and politeness. If you don't speak any Chinese, please be patience with them.   Food: oh boy oh boy oh boy. I haven't had steamed dumpling and fried pork this good for a very long time. As soon as the dumpling came out of the kitchen, all 4 of us cleaned it in less than 5 minutes. The fried pork was so tender that the meat falls off as soon as you chew on it. The boiled fish was spicy as advertised, but unfortunately the fish has lost a bit of its flavor. We also ordered the hot & sour soup and it was absolutely delicious. You can tell that they aren't cheap on their ingredience neither.   Orange and kuo pao chicken isnt chinese food. If you want to know how authentic Chinese food really tastes like, this place is it! I cannot wait to come back here again"}
{"text":"Amazing Szechwan place!  This place is now on my itinerary.  The food tasted amazing and it was so cheap. I am so glad that unlike place in San Francisco they don't nickle and dime you by charging for rice per serving.  We ordered Hot and Spicy Tofu, Fried Chicken cubes with hot pepper and hot and spicy pork kidney. All the dishes were amazing and the waiting staff was super friendly... as with all the good food places, it's pretty packed at lunch so plan accordingly."}
