{"text":"Very good! Fresh food love it! My half eatin croissant egg and cheese/bacon sandwich mmh!"}
{"text":"It wouldn't surprise me if I saw Carmen Sandiego and Waldo grabbing lunch here one day. It would be an understatement to say this spot is hidden. It's around the back corner of a bank, not visible from the street, and signage is limited. 

Menu includes breakfast and lunch specials (soups, salads, sandwiches), and coffees- the coffee is what brought me in this way, but the machine was broke and they were oddly out of soup at 11AM. Ordered a pastrami sandwich (fresh but plain) with fries for my guy and a seafood Louis salad for myself- both were made fresh, nicely presented, and well-priced. The salad was overflowing with shrimp for under $10.

 I had to call to get directions because this spot was so hard to find. 
Note that this spot is only open weekdays for lunch hours."}
{"text":"Great selection. QUALITY food! Prices are cheap. They deliver and don't charge a fee. Friendly staff. My favorite deli in town."}
{"text":"Great place!  Fresh food!  Amazing service from Sam... You don't get service like this anymore!  You have to try this place :)"}
{"text":"Was at a car chop nearby and found this place on Yelp.  I got the Philly Cheese Steak and Fries and my hubby got the Club.  Made to order and was only a short wait.  Decent prices.  I would
Come back again!"}
{"text":"I've been to Sam's Courtyard Deli at least a million times!  I used to work at Wells Fargo in the office park where the Deli is located.  I met Sam when I first started in 2003 and I've never met a friendlier guy who appears to love what he does.  And what still amazes me to this day is that Sam has the superhuman ability to remember each of his customers by name.

The food is great!  I've had just about everything on the menu but my favorites are his homestyle daily lunch specials.  I haven't worked anywhere near this location in 4 years and I had been dying to get back for lunch one day.  I was finally in the neighborhood (truthfully I drove up from E Sahara ... it's that good) and dropped in for the pot roast lunch special with mashed potatoes and vegetables.  It was as great as I remembered!

If you're in the neighborhood looking for a great place for lunch, go find Courtyard Deli.  I dare you to find something you don't like on that menu ... which I'm pretty sure is the same handwritten whiteboard menu unchanged since I first saw it all those years ago."}
{"text":"Homestyle Cooking for CHEAP!! $4.95 Breakfast $6.95 Lunch Specials No Minimum FREE Delivery!!

Food is always good,prices are fair and they have a great menu of items from sandwiches to dinner type meals like pot roast, open faced turkey sandwiches and more.

{"text":"Courtyard Deli simply put is classic American fare. The food is just like your grammy or mama would make. Large portions, quality, homestyle cookin', and delivered for free by Sam the man.

My personal favorites are Pot Roast (served every other Wednesday) with mashed potatoes, pot roast gravy, and green beans. The 3 bean soup. Portions are HUGE (literally 2 meals in one - great for sharing or enjoying later) and all for the cost a Big Mac Meal at McD's.

Locally and family owned."}
