{"text":"Mothers has been a great place forever. Not fancy, They have great sandwiches & burgers. The onion rings are great. We take visitors from out of town here regularly"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! Great people, great drinks, great prices and overall just a awesome atmosphere!!!! Lol just a tip the stalls don't have doors in the bathroom which in my opinion gives it character but for the uptight it might not be for u.... Love love the food!!!!!! Everything is awesome!!!! But overall I love the street signs with the bullet holes in the patio and inside really makes it look bad ass"}
{"text":"Great, legendary hole in the wall in a rather undesirable area of west Phoenix.  The Burgers are nice and juicy, ad a little salt&pepper and enjoy.  Fries are nice and crispy, buns are super soft and fresh, excellent, friendly service.  A nice place to stop for a good burger and a cold beer if you're ever out in that area!"}
{"text":"I've been here once years ago and just recently when back last week. I can say without a doubt one of the best burgers in Arizona!!  The burger is juicy, the cheese is melted and the fries are not al a carte. Hot fresh and great service. This place is a total dive but you know what those are the best places.  Do yourself a favor and try this place out and if a burger joint is serving fries al a carte. Get the heck out of there!!"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on a Friday.  Good food, cool ambiance, had the fish Sandwich and an ice tea.  The fish was perfectly crispy and it came on a roll, big plus.  They keep it simple in a good way.  Waitress was sweet and very helpful."}
{"text":"Awesome dive bar type of venue with great food, drinks and service.  Chicken fried steak sandwich was incredible!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Mothers on and off for 10 years. The food and service are always good."}
{"text":"Without a doubt one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. The French dip was perfect with some mozzarella cheese. Fianc√© got the patty melt and had nothing but high praise for it. Recommend this place to anybody in the Phoenix area who wants a nice, cheap lunch. Can't wait to go again"}
{"text":"We got stranded since our house reservation got cancelled minutes before our arrival.  Mother's was close by and exactly what we needed.  There may have only been 1-2 people working, but they got our party of 6 squared away with cold beers and baskets of fries while we charged our phone and tried to resolve lodging.  The burger and hot wings were very good."}
{"text":"The food is great and the service was nice as well. Facilities needs to be fix but that is it.   Don't be scare to go in is like a cave but is good."}
{"text":"Awesome dive bar. Great sandwiches, good drinks, great people! This place showed up on yelp when we were out that way, so we decided to stop in real quick for lunch ended up spending the rest of the afternoon there. Had a blast!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place as a kid. Was in the area and thought I would stop in for a burger. I had the chili burger. The burger was obviously one of those frozen, pull the paper off and slap it on the grill patties. It wasn't good. The chili was a runny, cheap, out-of-the-can type. Also not good. At least I can say I went back after 25 years. I probably won't be back for another 25."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Everything they serve is great including their friendly customer service."}
{"text":"Love love love it here! The service is great just like the food. I recommend the beef dip, you will not be dissatisfied! The beers are cold and fresh."}
{"text":"Best place in town for a great burger and fries!   The buns are really good, high quality.   Love their Buns and Ranch dressing.  Food quality is really high and fresh.  The waitress (Mothers Granddaughter) is sweet and gives solid service.  For the quality and size of food,  great priced!!"}
{"text":"A cool dark dive! Great burgers and fries. Ice cold beer! Nice people. Well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this place! When we pulled up, it looked like a dump but oftentimes the best food is found in a hole in the wall. Came for a light snack, i.e. Onion rings and they were great!!!"}
