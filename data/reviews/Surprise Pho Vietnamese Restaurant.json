{"text":"This was the first time I've tried this restaurant. Excellent Pho and I eat a lot of it all around the valley. The herbs were fresh the broth was flavorful and the service was great. I highly recommend this spot and I will be back soon."}
{"text":"We tried this place because it is new and we love pho.  The atmosphere is nice and not so rush rush like some other pho restaurants can be.  They had some great music playing which added to the ambiance! We only tried the pho tai but it was delicious, the portion size is well worth the price and the broth was amazing.  We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Very good food and friendly people. We already have been there twice. So glad we have another one pho restaurant nearby. The broth tastes very good for the pho. And they did mention they prices are going to be reduced."}
{"text":"Both my wife went there for dinner. We both had the beef Pho. It was my wife's first experience eating Pho. She thought it was delicious, as did I. I thought the Pho had wonderful flavor and the serving was more than adequate. A must try."}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly service. I would recommend this spot for anyone . No alcohol. Will definitely be back to try more entrees."}
{"text":"The owner always makes sure you are taken care even when it's time to leave he packages your leftovers to make sure they are perfect for later! Servings are huge and I love bringing my kids! Try them you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Pho was really good and we will come back for the soup. The eggrolls didn't have much flavor and were soggy and not fried crisp, would skip them next time.

What was really impressive was that we ordered iced jasmine tea and when she brought the check the drinks were not on the bill. I informed her that she forgot to charge us for the drinks and she said that iced tea was free. That is awesome and how it should be everywhere as iced tea costs next to nothing to make.

Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Our favorite menu item is the grilled pork chop dish.  Excellent flavor!  There are two chops on the plate as well as rice and a wonderful crunchy cabbage salad.  All the dishes use fresh ingredients, and all that we have tried have been delicious.  The smoothies are made with fresh fruit (we ask for the smoothie with boba added rather than getting the thinner boba tea.  The banana smoothie with boba is a real treat!).  Small shop, clean and pleasant.  The owner and his wife are very nice and welcoming."}
{"text":"This'll underwhelm you thoroughly.  Horrible service.  Two of three dishes ordered were wrong. Asked if meat in spring rolls, was told no but they came out with chicken.  Spicy pork order came made with chicken and had to wait to get remade.  No boba tea even though listed on menu.  What Vietnamese restaurant lists NO vegetarian entrees on menu?  Worst was waiter who conveniently pretended to not understand when it was time to compensate for errors.  Perhaps no tip helped him understand."}
{"text":"Yes!! Best pho I've had. It's housemade and the broth is delicate and flavorful. I got meatball (tendon meatball) that was tender. I learned afterwards I can omit the noodles. They make cafe sua da the old fashioned way, but not at the table. And they even asked if I wanted to add hot tea in order to extract all the lovely sweet cream from my glass. 

I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"In Surprise for business and wanted something healthier and fresh.  Service was excellent.  Great choice.  Will return again next trip."}
{"text":"Not sure why there are so many good reviews here, I was pretty disappointed. Server was nice but on the slow side and got a few things wrong with our order. My pho was fine, but definitely not outstanding. I got the filet mignon pho and it was not worth the $13 for a bowl of pho, that's outrageous. The broth did not have good flavor, and the large bowl was mainly just broth, not much noodles or meat."}
{"text":"The owners and staff are very nice the Pho isn't bad, a lot of noodles not much broth . The soda is by the can , not so good and the spring rolls are mediocre.  We will try it again in a few months . And please lower the 80s rock music."}
{"text":"This place is beats all PHO places is Surprise they have a great variety of PHO,rice dishes Also rice noodle dishes. The broth is amazing most places taste like water. You have to go try this place !"}
{"text":"The staff is super attentive and so nice. Our food was delicious HOT and truly authentic. We aren't from AZ but if we were, we would eat here all the time. 
Super reasonable and so tasty!"}
{"text":"Very nice new restaurant. The food was good. Not many Pho places in Surprise, so I'm glad to see this opening up. I got the Bun and Spicy Pork BBQ (I'll try the Pho next time). The bbq plate was a little pricey, but worth it. I'll def be back next time."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite.  Air conditioner had a setting close to a frozen meat locker.
Someone must have said something, because it was adjusted while we were there.
Please realize I'm not a Vietnamese Food Connoisseur so take this review with a cup of Pho.
Waitress was extremely shy, appeared of oriental descent, and courteous.  She however didn't know what some of the food items were, because we didn't know.  We had soup prior to the meal, dunno what kind but it was very good.  Wife ordered Pho something, and it was huge, she couldn't finish it and ended taking some home.  I played it safe and ordered chicken fried rice, extremely dry, nothing like the Korean chicken fried rice I used to have while in the USAF.  We also had egg rolls, I think I'll pass on them when we go back.  Son in law is a Pho expert and should be flying in from Seattle in a few months.  The owner came up to our table and introduced himself to us, a very very nice man.  He explained to my wife what sauces to use for her meal, etc.  I will go back once the SEA to PHX flight lands, and give it another try.   I never pass total judgment on the first encounter.  Well that's it Pho now,"}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant and we absolutely love it. I have gluten issues and they were more than helpful and accommodating. My husband and I went here for lunch. We ordered spring rolls, shrimp fried rice, and combination noodle soup. Everything was absolutely amazing. The service was fantastic. This is my new favorite spot to eat. Since they just opened up they are offering free soft drinks right now too. I would highly recommend this restaurant to family and friends! Everything was delicious and tasted so fresh. The servings are large too. The restaurant was super clean. They have huge TV's and were playing music videos on one, which we enjoyed the music. Dine in or take out, either way I think you will be pleased with this new Pho restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the best pho in Surprise by far. I got the filet mignon pho and it was so amazing. Their spring rolls are also really good! I definitely recommend going here."}
{"text":"The \"veggies\" pho should not be named vegetable pho but instead just simple noodle pho. It consisted only of broth, noodles and the green onions on top.. There were no other vegetables in it. 

I also ordered the shrimp spring roll. Inside of the shrimp spring roll was chicken. The menu should have stated shrimp and chicken spring roll instead of just saying shrimp. 

There were no descriptions for these items on the menu as far as stating what the dish consists of. One would think a veggie pho and shrimp spring roll wouldn't need explaining but that is not the case here."}
{"text":"New place to get our lunchtime Pho on. We typically hit PT Noodles south of the base, but this place is about the same distance, but north. My lunch crew all gave it great reviews. First off its a lot bigger with room for large groups. Lacks outdoor seating, but makes up for it with great tasting broth and your typical Pho menu items. Very fast service and the large bowls were HUGE! I also liked the Boba Thai tea. We will definitely return again"}
{"text":"First time eating here the noodles were delicious and the soup very flavorful and fresh server was nice though never asked if wanted drink refilled only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars"}
{"text":"Great food and an excellent staff. The ingredients were fresh and the prices were reasonable for such high quality ingredients.  My husband had the seafood pho and I had the shrimp fried rice. We had a couple of spring rolls, as well. The restaurant was clean and uncluttered. This will certainly be our \"go to\" place when we have a taste for Asian food."}
{"text":"I really like this small vietnamese restaurant. Out of all the places I've been, this places gives the most meat in the pho. The pho broth is solid, not the best but certainly very good. The manager is super nice and the ambience is cool. Food is served quick and hot with prices that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Surprise and in the Phoenix area. I always get the BBQ Pork with rice and it is delicious. My wife always gets the Pho and loves it. The service is very fast."}
{"text":"I've officially tried every pho restaurant on the west side and I'd rate this 3rd. I'm a regular at my #1 spot, typically 2-6/mo. I'm a phoholic!! With that being said, everyone's flavor profiles are different so this could be your favorite! 

Service: 4 stars! Staff is friendly but kind of slow when I was trying to check out and it wasn't busy (3 tables dining). 

Pho: 3 stars! Got the #3 rare steak. Broth was flavorful, mellow and not overpowering. The bean sprouts weren't crunchy fresh, seemed like they were sitting in water too long. NO CHILI OIL!!! That's a necessity for spicy lovers. (The actual broth I'd say is a 4, the sprouts and no chili oil made it a 3 overall)

Spicy pork: 5 stars! There are only a few places on the west side serving this dish and this is the best I've had. It's served with white rice, salad and house soup. Must try! FYI, it's slightly fatty but that's exactly how it's suppose to be. 

Overall I'll be returning for the spicy pork and try a few other dishes. Suggest you ask for fresh bean sprouts! Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"We have so many good Vietnamese choices in Surprise but this is the place that takes the best of each and is the winning combination!! They have the friendly, family atmosphere that Saigon Kitchen is missing. They have sit down service and the ingredients are definitely high quality - these things are lacking at V-Pho. They are the winner over PT Noodle for me because I can walk here. 

Especially considering this is a brand new restaurant, I was very impressed. 

Room for improvement: they do not have a soda fountain. Right now soft drinks are free though which is an excellent move on their part. And I did not try their boba or Vietnamese iced tea yet. 

We had the filet mignon pho and the bbq pork bun. The pork was so good- tender and smoky without being sweet. We also had the spring rolls- the sauce was a little on the salty side but I'd still order them again."}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened and I am definitely going to be suggesting this restaurant to my family, friends and coworkers. The food was delicious and the service was great. As for the portion sizes, they are very big. My rice noodle bowl was definitely more food than I could eat with all of that amazing broth, tender meat and fresh vegetables. Try this place if you are looking for a satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Excited to have another Vietnamese restaurant in Surprise. Ordered combo pho, spring rolls and combo fried rice. Personally, this place have the best pho in Surprise, everything else was just okay. I will be back to try other things on the menu. Quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Really clean nicely lit restaurant.  We stop for lunch which turn out to be excellent.   I ordered the small beef pho which was more then enough for myself.  My wife ordered the bbq pork which came with a salad and rice she said it was tender and took part of it home.  Everyone was very nice service was ok.  The reason for 4 stars is they being Pho out right away and pork dish took ten minutes need to learn to bring out together.  Have same problem at PT Noodles and S.k. Guess Vietnamese serve this way.  I will be back as Pho is best of the 3 Vietnamese restaurant around us"}
{"text":"Everything tasted good but this place is a bit pricey and they don't have the roasted chicken hen like Pho Viet."}
{"text":"Stopped in because I was in the area working.  Nice little restaurant located within a strip mall of several other businesses.  We chose this place based on what was close to the site I was working at and past reviews.  

There were only a couple of other tables with people in them.  We were led over to a booth and offered drinks.  Their menus are big with lots of choices.  Prices were reasonable.  I ordered the dumplings and a stir fry with rice, veggies, and tofu.  The dumplings were great...although I didn't really care for the sauce that accompanied them.  They were cooked to perfection with a brown, crispy side and the filling was flavorful.  The stir fry was also good, although I'm not sure what happened to the tofu.  It was cooked beyond the point of anything edible, just a brown, hard, piece of leather.  The broccoli was crisp tender and the bok choy was just perfect.  I also found their rice to be a bit dry.  

Overall a good experience and if I'm in the area again, I would stop and try something else!"}
{"text":"We live in Washington State where there are many Pho resturants.
This has to be the best we have tried anywhere mostly because it is clean the food is authentic and fresh and the service is amazing.
It looks like most other reviews agree."}
{"text":"Refreshing mix of original Vietnamese style recipes. Great Pho Soup recipes and several other side dishes that will please your pallet.Service was great no wait for your meal and a very courteous staff."}
{"text":"A newly opened Pho place in surprise! Small family restaurant with a clean and open interior. Multiple televisions, one showing slides of their food, one playing sports and the last T.V. completes their ambiance with music from YouTube.

Ordered the BBQ vermicelli, beef vermicelli and the steak pho with steak on the side as the main course. But you know we had to get some spring rolls and egg rolls too to start! The food was...great! You could easily tell they use fresh ingredients in their food. I am hoping this place keeps up their standard! 

To the employees, thank you for the wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"The server that we had did not acknoweldge us, didn't introduce herself, did not give us any recommendations from the menu and basically just stood there when we were seated. When we were done eating, we had to flag her down to get the check. Mind you, we were the ONLY people in the restaurant. And when someone walked in and wanted to place a to go order, the owner of the restaurant started talking to the customer. But wouldn't you want to introduce yourself to people who are actually eating inside your restaurant? He did not even come up to ask how the food is or anything. He'd rather talk to the customer who placed a to go order, I guess. My wife and I will most likely not be back due to the poor service. As far as the food, it was decent for the price."}
{"text":"This spot is great. They have such accommodating service staff and the food is on par with much of what I have had in Vietnam. Their hot stone entrees are reasonable and well put together (kind of a mix of Japanese bento box for starch/ salad and soup with sizzling nicely marinaded pork or chicken. The pho is well done and has a lot of flavor. I love the fact that they take the time to hand roll their spring rolls correctly - all of the veg is super fresh and fragrant too! Keep up the good work, but would you add a few bahn mi options for me !! They even provided my toddler some pho (which she ate/drank entirely) local eats, great stuff !"}
{"text":"Amazing service & family owned restaurant. I love the casual environment and the food was served fast, I tried the filet mignon pho and my husband tried the brisket pho, I personally liked the taste of the broth better on the brisket one but that's personal choice. I personally can't wait to go back and try their fried rice as I could hear people close to our table giving compliments about their fried rice. Will definitely come back & is honestly one of the best pho places in the area."}
{"text":"Pho took a long time to come out and flavor was just sub par.  Broth lacked the flavor I find at similar pho places around town."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for lunch. We had the spring rolls and egg rolls combo and they were both delicious. I had the shaking beef and she had the steak Pho. Both were a lot of food and very flavorful. I would recommend this place. The service is friendly and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"I know it's new, so I'll preface the review by saying we'll come back after a few months to see if they've been able to improve on our issues. 

Grabbed a quick bite with my husband the other night. We were seated quickly, ordered, and brought our drinks (Diet Coke in a can) and my pho very quickly. I ordered the small chicken pho and it was delicious! The broth was flavorful and the veggies were fresh. I inhaled the meal! 

The problem was my husband's meal. He ordered the Spicy Chicken for $16.99. After waiting a few minutes after my meal arrived, we called over one of the waiters to see what the delay on his meal was. He explained to  me that the pho is so much quicker because the broth is premade (I'm a pho fan - I know this!), and that my husband's chicken had to marinade....HUH? Okayyyyyyyy...

Fifteen minutes later - still no spicy chicken. We called over another server and was told again that the chicken was marinading and that chicken takes a while to cook. I informed her that I also have stir fried marinated chicken before and my dish never took 20 minutes. She apologized and went to check on the meal again.

Five minutes later, she came back with the rice, salad, and soup - BUT NO CHICKEN. We asked her how long it would take for the chicken and she told me that it was \"almost done\". At this point, it had been over 20 minutes since I received my meal, which I had already finished eating.  My husband was so frustrated that he told her to just wrap it up and we'd take it to go. She complied and quickly got the meal together, and brought us our check. Nothing was taken off the bill (aside from the Diet Coke - a grand opening special), and we weren't expecting anything to be. 

When we got home, my husband at his meal, and I tried it. I had expected it to be bursting with flavor, and spicy, especially since it took so long to cook. To us, it was good, but not $17 good, and not 30 minute wait good. I told him that's what he gets for ordering a rice dish at a place called Surprise PHO! 

Anyway, if we go back, and we have a better experience, I'll update this review. And, if you plan on ordering the spicy chicken, make sure to ask that all the meals be brought out at the same time as the chicken!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my pho here, it was my first time and it was good. Food was great I had brisket and two egg rolls. 4 stars since I asked for recommendations and didn't receive much in return. Will return"}
{"text":"I have been so excited for this place to open. Pho has to be my favorite food on the planet. When we walked in my first thought was how nice it was inside. We were seated right away, but no drink order was taken. We looked over our menu and after 10 minutes the waitress had still not taken our drink order or even came back to our table. There was only one other couple in the restaurant at the time. When she finally came over we told her our drink orders and food. We were served quickly minus our sons food. Our Pho was delicious and I could see us there again and again for the food, but after another 15 minutes went by with no waitress and no food for our son we decided not even to try to ask about it at that point because he'd rather have McDonald's. Another lady came out to give us our check and after making sure they didn't charge us for the missing meal we paid and left. I could have spoken up about it, but honestly with how slow the waitress was I can't imagine how much longer it would take. I really hope this place succeeds and as I said the food was awesome, but I'm afraid If this is the grand opening and this is how their service is now I dont think they will."}
{"text":"Excellent, the food was very good.
I am  Glad we have a nice variety of PHO Houses here in Surprise."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this restaurant and it was worth the wait. 
The service was fast and friendly, the atmosphere was casual and family-friendly, the table and utensils were clean and neat, and most importantly the food was hot and delicious! 

I had a Thai iced tea with boba and combination pho (#2) large bowl.  There were plenty of rare steak, tendons, meatballs, and noodles. The large bowl was very filling. 

This place will be my go-to pho restaurant in Surprise!"}
{"text":"Good flavors but not worth of having your orders all screwed up. My husband ordered flank pho and got brisket instead which is not that easy to mix match, my order came with no salad. Waitress offered to take his order off but charged the card in full, when we pointed it out she offered to just pay for our meal but after looking at the bill mumbled I am not paying for that and just gave us cash for his meal and forgot to refund the sales tax. I am not asking for free anything but I would personally like to get what I payed for."}
{"text":"Never had Vietnamese food before when I was in The Marine Corps  it's Good at 70 years old"}
{"text":"I had the pork, soup, salad and rice.  The pork came in very tasty thin slices and was excellent. The soup was a clear broth and a bit better than average. The salad had a nice assortment of greens and a creamy dressing.

My partner had the bun, with pork and spring roll. Filling for the spring roll was ok. The bun had lots of tasty vegetables.

Friendly quick service. (We arrived a bit after 11 am).

Excellent prices and a comfortable atmosphere.

We will return."}
{"text":"New! Friendly! Awesome!

Tasty Pho, generous portion too. Very clean and good selection. I got my Pho to go. Very quick! I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Clean restaurant ! great friendly service. The wait isn't long at all. There's a modern look to the restaurant. I'll be coming back again!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday we went to this restaurant for first time, staff very friendly,  fast service, good price and the food was very tasteful."}
{"text":"I love that this Pho restaurant is open right down the street from my home. There is enough space here to come in groups. The service was very good. The food really hit the spot for me. My daughter and I shared the bbq pork chops served with rice and was enough to feed us both. The shrimp fried rice was delicious and was big enough for 2 adults and 2 kids to share. We will back :)"}
{"text":"Wow! Not saying I was surprised it was so good, but that was really good. Looks like I don't have to leave Surprise to eat while at Spring Training now."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good pho in Surprise.  Gave this place a shot while visiting my girlfriend. The broth was delicious. Nice and steamy, perfect for a cold day."}
{"text":"Excellent food and very kind staff. They let me grade papers while I ate and brought me hot tea with lemon for a sore throat :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Great service family business and the good is it if this world. I love Pho and Surprise Pho is great!"}
{"text":"Came here for the second time and the food taste just as good as the first time. I got the #5 (pho) and my wife got a #15 (pork with rice). Presentation was great and the food was delicious! The price is also pretty reasonable for the amount of food you get. I would highly recommend this restaurant to get your Vietnamese fix in the Surprise area!"}
{"text":"Best Pho in Surprise!! I ordered the number 1 beef Pho and it was amazing I have been to the other Pho places around here and the flavor in this broth is on a different level so delicious. Definitely will be coming back here for years to come."}
{"text":"Excellent Vietnamese food. One of the best Vietnamese restaurants I've eaten at; absolutely the best in Surprise, AZ and the surrounding area."}
{"text":"The redesign for the restaurant is beautiful! The service was absolutely amazing. The food was delicious! My boyfriend and I were able to share the Pho with some to spare. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"People were very sweet, restaurant was clean but the food is bland. We will give another try later down the road to see what has changed."}
{"text":"Me and my friend like to try out new pho places. I recently just moved to surprise and we decided to try this place. Out of all the places in the area, I have to say that this is the best! The broth has a very delicious taste, the egg rolls are nice and crispy and the beef fried rice was good also. Will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. Friendly staff. Excellent food. Really good? Pho sure! Really? Pho real! The broth is very savory, the egg rolls delicious and crispy. Prices are reasonable. If you like Pho, then you will like thus west side establishment."}
{"text":"I had the house fried rice. It was some of the best I've had. The service was also really friendly."}
