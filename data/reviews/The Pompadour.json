{"text":"My husband and I went last night based on rave reviews here.  Huge disappointment.  Shrimp was cold, over buttered and way too much garlic. Ahi tuna was pink in the middle. Tough on the outside.  Wrapping tacos in double corn tortillas drowns everything inside.  Use of spices, flavoring, was just way off.  While we appreciate effort, concept of small plate, tapas, we will not return."}
{"text":"SO excited to find this gem! Shared the shishito peppers, calamari fries, Serrano manchego crostini and ahi tuna dishes. LOVED everything! Atmosphere was cozy and friendly, incredible menu yet unpretentious, and fantastic music on rotation. Calling all foodies who find their live music at Beachland, Grog, Mahalls, and the like -- don't miss this precious place!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in last week and absolutely loved it!  We've always been a huge fan of the Motor Mouth food truck and we're very impressed with their brick and mortar transition!  We had the arocini peppers, house burger, and coconut milk cod and it was all amazing.  The food was cooked perfectly, delivered promptly, and we look forward to trying all the other small plate options.  The beer selection was great and the cocktails made by enthusiastic and well trained bartenders were perfect.   This is a wonderful little hidden gem in Fairport Harbor and we'll be back many times in the future!"}
{"text":"Over priced for the quality of food served! Tuna wasn't fresh and was over cooked, shrimps were drowned and tiny!! Burger was burnt on the outside and raw on the inside. They have a good idea but need a complete rethink of quality and price if they want to survive as a business and get regular repeat business."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 5 stars.  It is a cool little bar and I love what they have done with it.  The food is great, the drinks are strong, what else can I say?  I had the mushroom tacos, which were amazing, the pork belly was great, very creative menu here.  Definitely worth checking out if you are in Fairport."}
{"text":"There is nothing great about old ahi tuna defrosted in microwave!  Then Seared I'm pan to cover up the cooked outside from the defrost.  Unevenly cooked filet saturated in butter.   The food is absolutely terrible it really is.  If you think this is great food or even close to okay then you don't get out much.  It's just a shame this place won't last"}
{"text":"This is a nicely renovated bar -good lighting, friendly staff and atmosphere. The inside is small but there is an outside patio as well. We tried the heirloom tomato salad, paella stuffed mushrooms and the crab cakes. All delicious. We will return."}
{"text":"this place is great , everything i have had is a fantastic . from the calamari steak fries to the lamb lolly pops everything was great."}
{"text":"I love the fact that this place is local and I don't have to go to Cleveland for a fine dining experience! It's such a cozy and laid back little gem in Lake County, both in the restaurant and out on the patio. I've been there a few times and recently visited on a Thursday night with live jazz music. The employees were very prompt and friendly, even with a packed house. (My hubby and I sat at the bar...we weren't in the know about making reservations, but we will next time for sure.) I ordered a seasonal apple vodka based drink, which was a great aperitif. We started out with the warm citrus marinated olives, which are a must if you love olives. We also had the steak crostini and the marinated mushroom tacos. They were so good we ordered a second plate of them! I also had the House Tiki drink. It was unusual but really tasty. I can't wait to go back! I'd give them more stars if I could!"}
{"text":"What a gem, nice back patio, great innovative craft cocktails, wide variety of great beers and the basics as well. Fantastic small plate food which is nice imo because then you can taste more of the spectacular menu. Will def be back. New favorite place."}
{"text":"Love the small plates at a The Pompador in the Lake Erie village of Fairport Harbor OH. There are different specials sourced locally. If you want an incredible mule try the Finnish Mule Cocktail. Last time we were there they had an awesome \" steaming\" blue cocktail too. Causal upscale dining 10 minuets from Mentor and 5 minuets from Concord and Painesville."}
{"text":"Place is an absolute gem! Such an inventive and creative menu. The service is also exceptional and the price is completely reasonable. Cute little patio, too."}
{"text":"Holy crap! This place is amazing. Its this little bar in Fairport Harbor, right on High St., but it feels like a high end bar & grille. They serve tapas that are both beautiful and delicious and made from fresh ingredients! The girls behind the bar are super efficient and fun to be around! The food and drinks are reasonably priced. It is clean and the decor is very cool. I am just stunned at how nice the Pompadour is! In other news, if you need to Uber home, due to over indulging, you wont be in trouble for leaving your car parked out front. There is no \"overnight parking ban\" in Fairport."}
{"text":"This place is totally a sleeper. In for business from SoCal and this place could easily compete with the best Tapas places there. They should expand the menu about 5 more items and move to a more hip area around Mentor."}
{"text":"Love this little place, only wish Fairport had more to offer like this !  The food was great and the atmosphere is perfect !"}
{"text":"Some friends of ours suggested that we go into Fairport Harbor and try out this little place called The pompadour. For us we don't normally go to Fairport Harbor for much of anything cuz they really didn't have much of anything to offer us. Which is a shame because it's a really cute little downtown that leads right up to a waterfront Beach but has a seasonality to it that doesn't lend itself to year-round visitation.  If you didn't know it was there you would drive right past it but that's the beauty about the place. It's really small has only about five or six tables but some of them are large. And then the bar seats about 15 people. This is a tapas bar so the food is meant to be shared. From what we've learned is that you really need reservations on the weekends and they do book up but during the weekdays it's relatively easy to get in there and it was a very nice experience.  We ordered the calamari steak fries which is a bunch of calamari chopped up and molded into what looks like a steak fry which for someone who doesn't eat seafood is deceptively delicious looking yet I didn't want to try it but my wife said they were A1. We also ordered steak crostini and turkey meatballs. We also had the carrot plate. I only real feedback other than presentation was beautiful and the meal would have been a five-star delicious meal save for the salt. It was exceptionally salty. I did have an opportunity to speak with the owner and gave him some feedback directly that I felt that he needed to know that maybe he had a kitchen accident where a little too much salt may have been added. Our drinks were fast and delicious no problem there it's just there was way too much salt. Nothing that would stop us from going back there because we will definitely go back there to try to see if it was just a one-off issue.  We learned that the place is been a couple different bars and a hair salon prior to it becoming the pompadour.  Neat place, will be back"}
{"text":"The food is excellent. We especially enjoyed the spinach dish, steak crostini and turkey meatballs. Six of us enjoyed a very flavorful evening. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"killer. love it. superb! the best. go mike. go erin. yayyyyy   word count1234578499493939"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! The dishes are just mind blowing! Flavors that will blow your mind! Cocktails  are superb \"mixologist\" knows what he's doing!  Super cute & trendy spot! My new favorite!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing staff, and great atmosphere! Highly recommend the Pompadour. The bartender is a creative cocktail genius with a great personality. As for the menu selection, it is absolutely some of the best food I've ever had! My personal favorites are the Rocket salad, Mushroom tacos and the Crab cakes. Everything is fresh, unique, and absolutely delicious. The Pompadour is truly a must try!"}
{"text":"I loved the food! It was amazing and the hospitality was outstanding, they played good music and it wasn't too crowded. I definitely recommend this restaurant for everyone!"}
{"text":"We visited pompadour on a Saturday evening and sat on the patio. Every employee we encountered was very welcoming. The service overall was excellent. The atmosphere was dark inside and is an old remodeled bar. They did well with the space they had. There's really no natural light. The patio out back is small, but pleasant seating.   The menu is tapas style with one cheeseburger and fries dish being the only meal. We had the warm citrus olives, the spinach, the roasted vegetables with goat cheese and the burger and fries. Everything was creative and wonderfully flavorful. The dishes are a nice size with enough bites to share. I do think some of the items are over priced for the ingredients. It would be nice to see more items at the $7-10 price point to be able to try more. The craft cocktails were nicely done."}
{"text":"Small but great services and food. Extensive drink list, food is high quality! We tried both tacos, the bacon was incredible. Can't wait to go back, especially in the summer, ride Harley up there and sit outside"}
{"text":"What a gem in Fairport! We've been hearing great things about this place but couldn't quite equate up scale tapas and little old Fairport Harbor but how wrong we were! Due to the hard working and creative owner/chef Pompadour has some of the best food around and a cozy atmosphere that can't be beat! Fun way to go is to order 4 or 5 tapas and share (8 to 10 if two couples - even better). That way you can try a wide assortment of these fabulous treats, and they are all fabulous! Great drinks, awesome wait staff, great food and cozy atmosphere make this a must for all us foodies"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Ali the bartender is awesome. It's just a little pricey for Fairport."}
{"text":"One star is probably too high for this dump. A microwave is their primary cooking utensil, their drinks are overpriced for what you are receiving, and there is a faint smell of puke everywhere in the place. For the classy establishment they are trying to be, they sure have a tough time keeping riff raff out. They are also openly racist, homophobic, amd xenophobic. I DO NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent meal thoughtfully prepared.  The flavor and presentation was amazing.  Perfect portions to share and enjoy a variety of different items. All in a comfortable atmosphere. Don't miss the Filet Medallions."}
{"text":"This is a great find in Fairport. Great tapas, food is creative and complex with unique flavor profiles. I'm going to put this on my rotation for the east side. Place is small but has a charm. Nice outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Awesome job Pompadour! Your interior wasn't what we are used to for a Tapas restaurant but if you can get down with the hip vibe this will be your favorite place. The menu options are carefully considered and the food is beyond exceptional. We tried the olives (best we have ever had), calamari fries, mushroom tacos (phenomenal), Serrano and Manchego crostini.... and crab cakes. We will definitely be back to try the other menu options and have another El Diablo!"}
{"text":"So, stuck deep in the eastern suburbs of Cleveland, we envied the food scene in Tremont and Lakewood. The variety. The adventure. The playfulness.  The Pompadour is, well, a haven, a tough yet refined foodie temple. Honed from the humble vestiges of a neighborhood bar, this joint has the chops. The food is creative and fresh. It lofts through Seared Tuna with pickled onion and pear dishes, buries its nose in the fecundity of cured ham, egg and leek. Damn. Great music, atmosphere hosted by special folks taking a brilliant chance at the idea that truly great food can succeed anywhere. This tapas bar is worth your choice and your time and your pennies. Come, take your time. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious. The service was great. I love that the neighborhood has this. It's small and still has a neighborhood bar feel but the quality of what comes out of the kitchen is impressive. We had seared ahi in a vinaigrette with pears, a seafood stew with smoked paprika, and the cod special in coconut milk.  I know tapas means \"small plates\" as my wife reminded me as we mopped up all the sauce with the extra bread we were encouraged to order. So my problem isn't with Pompadour but with tapas in general. Wife loved it but after dropping over $80 on three plates, two rounds of drinks and tip I'd at least like to be full, let alone have something to take home. Being a fat, dirty American I just don't feel satisfied eating the proper amount, maybe they should have a tapa and a half option."}
{"text":"Food was really good!  Drinks where nice. The staff was amazing.  Only issue was the background music made it hard to hear."}
{"text":"OMG !  This place ROCKS !  Great food, greater service, greatest drinks !!!  You MUST be here !"}
{"text":"Just discovered this gem!!  Great food and friendly staff.  Definitely worth a visit!  We will be regulars!!"}
{"text":"Got a recommendation for this spot. If you know Fairport Harbor and its beach, you know a good place to eat will be a plus. And this is a plus!  From a non-descript front door, you will walk into a common neighborhood bar. Shuffle board bowling on your right along with a traditional bar, makes you feel right at home. Inside are tables that can seat up to 16 people, plus those at the bar. (Tonight, a party of 12 was taking over the inside, but we wanted the patio.) Move through the bar area and you get to an enclosed patio in the rear. 6 tables with plenty of room. Now the great part, the food.  One word, #OMG! What a surprise. Plates that are served at places that would charge $5-8/plate more were offered, in addition to a very expansive beer selection, plus a nice variety of drinks. We both started out with Mojitos, that had fresh bar-grown mint!! Great!  For dinner my wife ordered peach caprese and garlic shrimp, both served together and both at perfect temperature. She fave them up!  I selected the bacon tacos (2 served). Thick chunks of bacon wrapped in a tasty Aoli sauce and fresh slaw. AND served with two soft taco shells on each. This allowed for keeping everything in place. Great touch! And both were filling as well.  Only down side, smoking on the patio. Not a smoker, but really enjoy a meal without smokers nearby. I know it is allowed, but preferred the eating area non-smoking. Therefore a reduction of a star.   Overall a real surprise in a location that you wouldn't think would be here!"}
{"text":"The Pompaudor is really stellar.   I have always liked MotorMouth and what Chef Rusty James Phillips has offered at FARMAFARE, an annual farm to table dinner hosted by Lake County Soil and Water Conservation District, and our meal at Pompadour did not disappoint.   The wine and beer selection is modest, but carefully curated. Everyone in our party found something they liked that didn't break the bank. My Sazerac was a boozy masterpiece right down to the expressed citrus peel.  We ordered a stone fruit salad, calamari fries, crab cakes, and the bacon tacos. Picking a favorite would be like picking a favorite child, they were all fresh, balanced and perfectly cooked.   The atmosphere is cozy and modern with a little beachy flair. Just perfect for Fairport.   We can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a few brews since a friend of mine lives on this side of town. I was very pleased with the assortments offered, as well as the vibe of the place and the people. A nice and unique little bar in the center of a small town, serving (from what I hear) delicious food with an eccentric twist. If you're in the area, or hell, even if you're not, check this place out. Small but delightful!"}
