{"text":"Went there for lunch today and had to walk out.  Waitress had major problems understanding and speaking English.  She was not familiar with the menu either.  I asked her what the soup of the day was and she didn't have a clue.  She went to check and came back to say they were making the soup....but it would not be ready.  Mind you, we walked in at 11:45 am....wouldn't a diner make sure they had soup ready for their lunch crowd?!  By the way....we were the ONLY diners in the entire restaurant.  I asked the waitress if they made their salad dressings in-house and she said no.  We then turned in our order and regretted it instantly.  We didn't feel our waitress even took down what we asked for.  She was nice but obviously unsure of herself.  We asked her to cancel the order & left.  The place smelled really funky!  Music would have helped the big, empty, eerily silent restaurant."}
{"text":"I agree with all of the bad reviews that i have seen posted. Hand's down the worst experience that I have ever had at a restaurant. The food was inedible. We seriously threw it in the trash when we got home. I'm not exaggerating, ordered pizza after spending almost $40. I can't believe it's still open.  Not for much longer I'm sure. The owner is very shady. Doesn't deserve the one star. I believe the cashier was around ten years old.  The owner's daughter, real professional."}
{"text":"When you first walk in you notice the aroma of a musty basement.  It doesn't get better from there.  The food appears good  on the menu and website.  WARNING!  iT Does not taste good or look good in reality.  They were out of hamburger meat on a Friday no less.  The service is the only thing I can say positive about the place.  The owner's attitude is horrible and the only thing Brooklyn about this place.  '

On the other review, I saw the thing about the credit card being overcharged.  Same thing happened to my co-worker."}
{"text":"If it was possible for me not to give a star then that is how I would rate this place. This was one of the worst if not worst dining experience. Everything we go was disgusting. I ordered an appetizer sampler that was so burnt it was inedible. It was also missing items listed on the menu. I also ordered the buffalo shrimp and it came out as regular fried shrimp with cocktail sauce. I said um this isn't buffalo shrimp and he said yes it is. He said buffalo is too spicy but he could bring me the \"sauce\" let me make my own determination. The rest of my party hated their food as well. There was some coleslaw and I use the word coleslaw losely as it too was gross. But what upset me most about the experience was that we left a cash tip and i noted cash on my cc reciept but they went an added an addtional 7 dollars to my amount. I would complain except I left the receipt and frankly I never want to go near that place again. We were so creeped out being the only people in the place....don't waste you time and money unless you want a horror experience....."}
{"text":"From the outside appearance, I thought this place might be closed. Should've checked Yelp before going in. I was literally the only person in there at peak lunch time (1pm) on a Monday.  It is pretty dirty and dated/ worn out looking. This location has been about 5 different restaurants in the past couple of years, looks like they just recycled what was already there from the other failed businesses. 

My waitress was pleasant, the food was edible but nothing special. 

Not to pile onto the owner, but he sat alone at the bar the entire time I was there. After finishing my meal, I waited about 5 minutes for the check before I went to the bar to ask my waitress for it and was told to just pay up front (no check necessary apparently).  The person I assume to be the owner was on his cell phone at the bar, and I ended up waiting at the register for a couple of minutes before he got up and came over to check me out.  He continued his cell phone conversation during the entire transaction and never once said a word to me. 

If you want to try this place out (not sure why you would), you better hurry."}
