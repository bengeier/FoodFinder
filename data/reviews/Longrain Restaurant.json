{"text":"Got enticed by a great web-saver offer.  First impression upon walking in, nice clean decor, open space, lots of seating.     At first glance, menu seemed typical of a pan-asian, thai-inspired restaurant and was a bit disappointed with some items that had recently been marked as `currently not available', which from the pics, seemed quite interesting & different from the typical, not sure if due to seasonal availabilites....
Waiter -Lou was attentive & very hospitable, bringing us iced lemon water and a small basket of prawn crisps at first seating.    Ordering & wait time was simple and was a reasonable timeframe.    Food came hot, nice portions and good simple presentation.
Wasn't expecting anything different from usual cuisine but the WOW factor came upon tasting!     All dishes were Very tasty, well-balanced, not lacking portions of protein & shellfish, as seen in many other places.     The best Curry Pad Thai I have had in a very long time!!!
 
Waiter -Lou and Owner -Alex were very attentive, friendly and wonderful hosts, happy to chat about their brief history in the neighborhood {~1yr} and expressly appreciated our feedback.    Price range was reasonble and definitely a good attraction factor as a newbie in the neighborhood.

Definitely a hidden gem soon to be a shining star among the up & coming great eats in Etobicoke!    

Looking forward to heading back again soon.....

{"text":"FOOD: a good selection of what they describe as \"Pan-Asian\" Cuisine. The dishes are what I would typically expect to find at a Thai restaurant -- mango salad, satay skewers, green/yellow curry, ginger chicken, basil chicken/beef, etc. I had the lemongrass Chicken and it was amazing! Very flavourful and nicely presented. I tried the mango sticky rice for dessert and it was also really good. 

SERVICE: friendly, fast and attentive. I should mention though that there were only two tables of diners at the time. Our server checked up often but did not disturb our meal. 

COST: appetizers/salads/soup: $4-8. Meal dishes: around $10-$12 (rice is an extra $1.50). We got free spring rolls for ordering over $25. It looks like they also have lunch combo specials for about $8 (main + side + roll + rice). 

OVERALL: A great find! The decor (with a water feature!!) and music fits well with the the type of cuisine. There's paid street parking right in front (free after 6pm). They cater and also deliver."}
{"text":"The menu was interesting but not overly ambitious, the food was excellent, the server was friendly and unobtrusive and the ambience was quiet and spacious.  We were very impressed and will be back."}
{"text":"Great food..after a day of golf..we randomly chose this restaurant..we wanted something quick and good with nice atmosphere..it was all of this..we had fresh spring rolls, pad Thai and green chicken curry..all was excellent. A good find"}
{"text":"This has become the local favorite that restaurant. Went with 4 others, and ordered... 

Papaya salad - thumbs up
Malaysia veggie noodles - amazing flavors, with thick noodles
Green veggie curry - somewhat light in flavor
Basil tofu - acceptable, very light, no basil was present. 

Would I go back? YES!!!"}
{"text":"Good Thai food across most of the menu. 

In theory they deliver. 

I say in theory because getting them to pick up the phone is slightly more difficult than actually walking to thailand."}
{"text":"Food was really great, service was fantastic, too bad the place only had one other table of customers. Really hope the place survives. Had the coconut chicken soup and my husband had the basil chicken and we share the Thai style eggplant. The soup was divine, could really taste the lemongrass and big chunks of chicken and hubby says the basil chicken was good. We'll be sure to order in from them regularly now."}
{"text":"Thai ice teas, mango salad, fresh rolls and curry Thai noodle soup. Everything was pan-Asian, ok and filing. Some items weren't served with the correct sauce. The lemon chicken was unimpressive.

Total w/tip: $55.00 which I found a bit steep for the quality"}
