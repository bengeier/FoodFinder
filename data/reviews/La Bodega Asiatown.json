{"text":"Place used to be great, but I think the manager is no longer there. Now every time I go in, they get my order wrong, I have to wait 15+ minutes in line even after calling in my order, they constantly charge me the wrong amounts, and the food is sub par. Runny soups, salads with brown wilted lettuce, and sandwiches with the grossest lunch meat I've ever seen. Not worth the wait or money. Also, if you are vegetarian and get a salad (they're about $12) without the chicken they still charge you the $12; same goes for the sandwiches. A grilled cheese is $8."}
{"text":"The Yelp 3 Star review is such no-man's land - on the one hand it's yellow instead of the bright orange, signalling maybe this isn't a great place; on the other, Yelp's description of 3 stars is \"A-OK\".

Having just come back from lunch there, the A-OK is an accurate description of La Bodega.  The sandwiches are freshly made, substantial for the cost, and the restaurant is clean and speedy.  All good stuff.

My rating of just three stars comes from there being really nothing special about the sandwiches other than the overwhelming variety of choices and the fact they are handmade with obvious care. Ingredients looked like basic \"store bought\" meats, cheeses and condiments.  This compared to some place like Herb & Twine that takes a more homemade approach.

So again - NOTHING wrong with this place and lots to like if you're looking for a freshly made sandwich with store quality ingredients.  Think a half step up from what you'd make yourself at home.

I just wish they gave you a pickle..."}
{"text":"Huge menu Of sandwich options, all of which include a bag of chips of your choice. These guys are doing sandwiches of greatness and freshness unparalleled by any competitor in the area. They pump out a sandwich in about 5 minutes during my lunch break from work, that has a lot of value. Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"I love La Bodega --particularly the Asia Town location! Fast service, great, fresh food.

Pros: great location for Asiatown/Midtown/St. Clair-Superior lunch crowd. This location is great, wonderful staff, wonderful dining room (I love being able to sit in the sun) and great variety on the menu

Cons: limited parking (I usually walk over), soups are pretty watery (asked the staff about it and they said it's because they try to keep their soups low-carb)

My personal favorites: 

#34 (Smoked Salmon, Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion and Mayo --comes on a bagel, but I order it on ciabatta)

#40 (Tomato, Mozzarella Boccicini, Fresh Basil, Pesto Mayo on rosemary ciabatta) --this is easily my favorite sandwich. And as an avid meat-eater, I'm just as surprised as you are. I loooooove this sandwich like no buddy's business."}
{"text":"SLOW. How long does it take to make a vegetarian  sandwich?  ANSWER I don't know buy it's over 15 minutes and the place isn't even busy.  You would think the vegetables are picked in the back after order.   I will never come here again.   I want to support local but this place needs a lesson from Cleveland Pickle.  Too expensive and too slow equals no business which means closing.  And there are not any Internet orders being picked up.  How ridiculous.  IS EVERYONE new?  It's a sandwich.  Cmon already.  I would complain in person but fear retribution to the never to be prepared sandwich.
New Answer,  ordered at 12:08 and received at 12:41."}
{"text":"I personally have not been very impressed. I ordered a salmon salad as takeout which was gross. My coworkers have ordered some delicious looking subs. I have also tried their chicken salad which was very good. The coleslaw had terrible, bitter flavor. There is plenty of seating inside but it was a hot day and it was blistering inside, apparently no air conditioning. The staff is very nice but the service is super slow. Good prices. No street parking in front but there is some a block or so away."}
{"text":"Delightful and delicious sandwiches!!!! My husband and I ate in for two sammies: the 42 for him (turkey, cole slaw, Swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, Russian dressing on sourdough), and I had the 23 (roast beef, carmelized onions, lettuce, tomato, cream cheese on rosemary ciabatta). The sandwiches were an excellent size, I found the roast beef to be very tender and complimented well by the onions and cream cheese. Thick cuts of turkey on hubby's sandwich, the Russian dressing/cole slaw/red onion was a combination he LOVED after being concerned how it would play out on the palate.

We also got a sandwich to go, the 33 (smoked salmon, wasabi cucumbers, tomato, red onion, cream cheese on a bagel)... had that for dinner! Very good, but would be better with a tad more cream cheese, and on an everything bagel or pumpernickel bagel... picky, I know! 

Overall, an excellent find in the Asiatown/Midtown area, will check it out again and try the Tremont location on the weekend! Lots of yummy sandwich ideas to still try!"}
{"text":"The tag like is \"all that and a bag of chips\" 
And it is. All sandwiches come with chips. There are many options, salads and more. A favorite stop during lunch!! Open only 10am-3pm Monday thru Fridy."}
{"text":"La Bodega is a wonderful little sandwich shop located in the Tremont and Asia Town areas of Cleveland. They have an expansive menus of salads, sandwiches and wraps. They are always willing to accommodate and make modifications to any menu item. The food is fresh and delicious and the variety is amazing. Try the #30, their chicken salad wrap, chef salad or anything on wheat bread!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been here a half dozen time and the food is always good. Today however my complaint isn't the food but the experience. I'm in a industry we're it's all about customer service and experience so I was very disappointed. I arrived at 12:03 and place my order for one wrap by myself. I didn't receive my order until 12:29 and only because I went up to them to find out where my food was. It was busy with phone orders I'll admit but the biggest issue I had was there was no apology given for the wait or anything. Unfortunately I probably won't return even though the food is good. When you pay a premium for something you expect premium service."}
