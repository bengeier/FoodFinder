{"text":"Let me start with saying I have never posted a negative review on Yelp. After being a long time customer, I have been horribly disappointed the last two times we have ordered.  The first time, my stuffed shells arrived cold and my daughters pizza was ice cold as well. We ate it and made the best of the situation... However, my daughter was up all night with a sick stomach and diarrhea... Clearly food poisoning. Today I had hoped they would redeem themselves, however I ordered a simple veggie pizza and the expected delivery time was only 45 minutes....and hour and a half later they arrived with my cold pizza. When the pizza arrived, the vegetables on top were uncooked and the center of the pizza was ice cold. When I called the restaurant to speak to the manager, he refused to come to the phone and instead expected a young girl to handle the situation. She told me \"we'll give you a discount next time or something\".  After speaking to my husband and not excepting this as a resolution to the issue, I called back to express my frustration and again the manager refused to come to the phone. Ultimately, they said they would come pick up the cold pizza and refund me however there were no apologies made for the situation. This is bad business and I will never order from them again as a long-time customer.    Sad to mark this place off my list as a place we will never order from again. Save yourself the grief and order from Jack's."}
{"text":"I LOVE Mia Famiglia. The food is DELICIOUS...Reminds me of Pizza & Italy dishes from home (NY NY). Joe (the owner) is Amazing & the staff are all wonderful. I highly recommend this place. It never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Don't even bother during the dinner time rush. The staff are consistently running circles around one another yet aren't able to provide customer need within a reasonable time. On top of waiting for the order to be complete, the food was actually less than tasty. The pizza crust was tough and chewy- didn't know that was possible.  This was my last visit to this store!!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area so I've been hunting for a good, local pizza place. I will admit I'm definitely a pizza snob. Well, my wife and I decided to order a pie to try it out and we were pleasantly surprised. We got a meat lovers pie, crust was perfect, toppings weren't too heavy, just right and the sauce and cheese covered everything nicely.  We've found our local pizza joint and we must not be the only ones cause the place was packed last night when we went in.  All in all great pizza, and my wife tried the spaghetti and sliced sausage and enjoyed that as well.  I'd say give it a try, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"The best place I have ever been in my life we order delivery every other day (I'm lazy) but it is sooooooo good"}
{"text":"Just recently, we ordered the Sicilian grandma pie and my husband went to pick it up. When he got there, he had to pay for his order. As he was waiting 20 minutes longer than he should have waited, the pizza man dropped the pizza when he took it out of the oven. They apologized but never offered a refund, the only  thing they offered was that they would deliver the pizza. My husband walked out only with the eggplant dish order and we had to wait another hour for the pizza to arrive. No only did they drop the pizza, they made my family wait over 2 hours for the pizza.  No one offered a voucher for next time or at least give him the money back for their mistake  and just deliver the pizza for free. The place makes good pizza, but they need to start thinking as to how they can keep their customers returning to the restaurant when mistakes happen."}
{"text":"I tried to place an order to pick up. Had to call several times to  get someone to finally answer the phone (yes, they were open.) The lady who eventually answered was completely rude and unprofessional. I ended up having to disconnect the call after I asked repeatedly to speak to a manager and was finally told she was the manager. This was my first and last experience with this establishment."}
{"text":"My wife and I get a pizza to go every Saturday and it is always well-prepared and delicious.  It is always prepared and ready at the given time and  people behind the counter couldn't be nicer!  Looking forward to a pizza this evening!"}
{"text":"All I can say is \"WOW\"!!  This place is simply awesome, and the food is absolutely delicious!!  It's without a doubt the best Italian food I've had since moving to NC from the Bronx in 2014.  Joe, the owner, is a very nice man and I had the pleasure of chatting with him for a while when I visited this past week.  I was catering a small gathering at my house and decided to order the food listed below to serve at our gathering.  1.  Baked Ziti 2.  Penne A La Vodka 3.  Chicken Parm 4.  Chicken Francese 5.  Caesar Salad  Absolutely EVERYTHING was delicious.  Even their Caesar salad dressing was outstanding!!  I am very happy that Mia Famiglia is so close to our home, and we intend on making it our go-to restaurant for delicious Italian Food!!  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"So I had this place as one of my first pizza and wings in this side of town.  So I had delivery of some wings and pizza and everything was pretty good.  Above average for my expectations and decided this could be my regular delivery pizza place.  So the next time the food was delivered cold.  The food wasn't even close to even the same quality.  So I was going to give it one final call and figure out the average of what may be the work of Mia Famiglia.  So I called for delivery and I was told that 'we are not doing delivery today'.  This is not even close to what I would expect for a local business.  Done."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza! And friendly staff!! Very affordable! Love their Monday through Wednesday special!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. The sauce is delicious and the owner is so welcoming. You have to order in advance though as it's always so busy."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing! I'm originally from NJ and haven't been able to find pizza that's even close to the pizza back home. A woman originally from NY raved about this place, so I decided to try it. All I have to say is Wow! Totally impressed with this pizza! Sicilian was pretty good too. Place was clean and the staff were nice. Definitely worth the drive. I'll be back again very soon."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a regular for us. Their pizza is the best around and their sandwiches are great if you're not in the mood for pizza. Joe is a great guy and the staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"This restaurant IS as good as it gets!  You cannot go wrong here!  Love everything they have.  Always busy.  Get there early!"}
{"text":"We had great service and great pizza. My six year old son loved the homemade sauce on his penne and meatball dish."}
{"text":"My wife and I get pizza from here at least once a week and it is truly one of the best pizza places I've been to and eaten from.   Crust is always thin and crispy, sauce is a traditional style , but isn't sweet and is well balanced with herbs. Toppings are always fresh and taste great.  I've also had strombolli, pasta and other great tasty foods from here. Everything is fresh and full of flavor!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Charlotte area for 27 years.  This is the best pizza I have ever had down here since I moved from NJ!  I FINALLY FOUND YOU AND REAL PIZZA!!!!  THANK YOU!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent little Italian restaurant with a variety of dishes... Their pizza and pasta is very tasty and Joe is  great with customers."}
{"text":"I'm not the type to write a negative review of a restaurant. But, I feel the need to warn people not to waste their time or money at this restaurant. Ate there tonight. The service was unbelievably slow. The food was bland, the dressing was watered down, and the sauce clearly came from a can."}
{"text":"I highly recommend Mia Famiglia.  The food is very good and the portions are very generous.  The staff is attentive and know their menu very well.  The prices are great.  My wife and I had meals there two weekends in a row.  I wanted to see if the experience on the second visit lived up to the first and boy howdy did it.  The owner Joe  and his staff will make you feel right at home."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza -- love the specialty pizzas.  My staff loves holiday weekends 'cause we treat with Mia Famiglia!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, the owner takes emense pride in his resteraunt and the quality of the food shows that. We eat there a few times a month and have never had a bad meal. If you like a good NY pizza this is a place for you. Be patient, everything is made fresh and takes a little longer than those chain pizza places, but is is sooooo worth the wait."}
{"text":"Best Pizza around!  Fun staff too..  NY pizza as good as from the boroughs! !  Wings are really good too!"}
{"text":"Food here is good not great. My kids love the pasta but the sauce can be salty. Pizza is ok - I'm not a NY pizza guy so I don't know how it compares but I didn't think it was impressive. Will go back because it's a middle of the road kind of place that isn't too expensive."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! My family loves pizza and we are always looking for the best & this place is definitely up there!!! The pepperoni pizza is amazing! The melted gooey cheese, the flavorful sauce, the crispy crust,  all work together to create a perfect slice! The best part of it all is.....*drumroll* THEY DELIVER!!!!! We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"As a former New Yorker of 37 years and living down here in NC for 14 years, Mia's pizza is a reminder of my days back on Long Island. A thin crust pizza that is not weighed down by a ton of cheese that you see far too often at other pizzerias. The crust is very good and a great break from other pizza joints that serve a crust that tastes and looks like white bread in the center.  The establishment is clean, and the staff is friendly, and the service excellent. I am looking forward to trying out the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff here are the friendliest anywhere, they are huge NY Giants fans (oh well, no ones perfect). The food here is awesome, my favorite are the wings with ranch. I haven't had the pizza yet, but it looks awesome. The salads are the biggest portions around. I highly recommend that you take the time to come and visit. I am sure you will love it too."}
{"text":"I live nearby and have been  a fairly faithful customer. I have to say the service is amazing and the food is awesome. Being originally from Chicago, I think I know a little about pizza..uhh I don't.. This place DOES ..pizza to die for.. Fried oreos.. omgg.. Tell them the Scentsy girls sent you.."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Not too much crust, not too much sauce, and herb balance was delicious!  It is a family restaurant, so this is not your romantic getaway place, however if you're wanting yummy food, this is definitely worth trying.  Next time, we might try a pasta dish, but then we'll have to take a pizza to go for later!"}
{"text":"Closest thing you are going to find to \"Northern\" pizza down here in the Carolinas.  Wings are pretty solid option also.  Good family options (4 different family specials).  Nice local mom & pop pizza shop."}
{"text":"I could eat here every single day!!! Best pizza in Indian trail/Matthews...and pasta is out of this world good! Prices are good to..."}
{"text":"Great place! Love the pizza and the Italian food. Tasty and great portions. Great staff as well.  Love the chicken parm and the Chicken Piccata. They make a great Pie and wings. This has become our go to place."}
{"text":"Great place for real New York Style food, great pizza, and hero, my kids  love this place,"}
{"text":"Great family place, enjoyed the pinwheels and it was nice that the owner came by to chat. Had a huge extra large meat lovers pizza which was also good. Would definitely come back. Thanks for the amazing experience. #1 pinwheels in the Charlotte area!"}
{"text":"I have continued to try new menu items and have to post an update. If you want a calzone or stromboli that focuses on ingredients and not a huge amount of bread - this is the place! Try the sicilian stromboli dor a wonderful flavor of sesame dough with just the right amount of ingredients. We love the custom calzones, again, not overwhelmed by dough but a perfect balance of ingredients to go with a great thin crust. Love it!"}
{"text":"Slow service, dirty plates, their text discount not working so we didn't receive the discount they advertise. Not sure why that's my problem. But most importantly the food was not good. The calamari was all batter, the Margarita pie wasn't hot. There were four of us and we got our food in shifts. Drove twenty minutes to go here and unfortunately we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Grandma's Style.. you have to try it. It does take about 45 minutes for it to  come out so if you don't like enjoying time with the family sitting down, call ahead. That's what we do every friday as part of our tradition.   I would have to say, I haven't had pizza this tasty since I last went to Queens. I've tried pizza all over Steel Creeke / Fort Mill, and nothing compares to Mia Famiglia. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Tasty enough pizza and southern Italian food, but slow as molasses service will probably prevent us from sitting down to eat here again. Waitress acted like she would rather be anywhere but where she was, \"serving\" us, and after waiting 40 minutes to get our meals, it took 20 to get our bills. It's definitely not doable during a std lunch our."}
{"text":"We live nearby and have had carry out here a couple of times. I must say we are impressed! We've had pasta, pizza and salad and everything is excellent! The prices are very reasonable too. I'm so glad we finally tried it! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Okay so I'm going to break this one down.... I ordered one pizza for delivery. It took an hour and sixteen minutes. The location is 1.7 miles away. Sooo okay I think maybe they're busy but it would worth the wait. Pizza arrives, delivery kid was nice, he was tipped well. Open the pizza box and imagine that cold pizza.... Awesome. So I nuke it in the microwave, still trying to give the benefit of the doubt here.... And it was just not what I was expecting. I eat white pizza a lot. All over the country. When I think white pizza I think aioli sauce, garlic, and several types of cheese like fontina Asiago and what not..... What did I get? A pizza dough with ricotta cheese spread on (no sauce) and mozzarella.... Talk about a dry chalk like texture. The only reasonable merit here was the crust it was thin, but strong, and crunched when you bit into it. Needless to say out of 8 slices, 7 hit the garbage can. I will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Good pizza and quick friendly service.  Nothing spectacular but dependable and consistent."}
{"text":"5 stars just for the pizza alone! We got three cheese pizzas for a holiday party, and they were a huge hit! This is the best pizza I've had since I left NY! Try it!"}
{"text":"Love Mia Famiglia... The staff is wonderful, the food is delicious.Reminds me of Italian Food in NY... The prices are fair... The canolis are DELICIOUS... Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Best pizza you could find in North Carolina! Service was great and staff was friendly! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I liked the pizza personally but the wife said it was way too greasy to eat more than a slice.   Granddaughter said the chicken parmigiana was tasteless.   Meatballs ok , garlic knots good but also greasy.  Wife will not eat here again I will to try the ziti or something but wait staff not to interested in refills or coming back to table that much.   Waitstaff leaves something to be desired.   Figured they would have brought the manager over but didn't.   More to come. Still waiting on the extra butter and more Diet Coke.  I saw this on that television they hang in restaurants to advertise the other places.   This one should not be on there that much.   Thanks for the 20% to join the text club but I'm canceling that."}
{"text":"Wings were good. Pizza was okay. Flys were everywhere I killed a fly while I was there. Management said there was nothing they could do. I would not come back."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to this location since they were Presto. Or Pronto. Or something with a P. I don't know if it's the same people who own/run the place, but the interior looks about the same, and service is friendly and quick, so that hasn't changed much either way.  When it comes to the actual pie, it's tasty - I don't know that I'd call it quite New York style, as it's a little bit smaller than most, but it is definitely in that vein, as you are looking at a thin and crispy crust, which can be problematic - mostly because they go down really easily, especially the smaller ones where in just a bite or two you're done, so you need another. And another.  Flavor is excellent, and the \"Italian White\", which is a sort of Margherita with white sauce instead of red, is probably the winner here, but there are other specialty pies that are good too, like a cheesesteak or eggplant, so make sure you try them and find one that fits your taste buds!"}
{"text":"We're from the New York area and we were hoping to find a really good pie out here like we had back home.  We were told about this place and decided to try it out since it was presented to us as a NY pizza house,  but we found the quality to be lower than what we hoped for.  The crust on the pizza was bland and a little \"cardboard'ish\" for lack of a better word, and the cheese tasted cheap. The crust  was missing something sort of like a store bought dough you purchase in the grocery store. We had a couple other items hoping it would be better the next time around, but not so much.  Just okay food.  Not terrible or anything,  but a far cry from real NY pizza."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza we have found in this area since moving down from the North 5 years ago. We were extremely disappointed when they stopped delivering and fresh, homemade pasta would be absolutely amazing (took off 1 star). The NY Style pizza is consistently delicious (the crust is perfection!), the chicken parmigiana is outstanding, the wings although small are tasty, the antipasta salad is a must have and their meatballs are authentic! The prices are very reasonable and they give my husband, who is a veteran, 10% off for his service and we appreciate that. Everyone employee there is nice with each interaction. We are loyal customers and will continue to be!"}
{"text":"Terrible!!! Service is awful, I will not be back! I ordered a pizza to go and was told it would be a 30 minute wait. I got there after 30 minutes....only to wait another 30 minutes! Finally I said forget it! I asked for a refund. The lady said \"let me see where they're at with your order.\" I followed her and when she asked how much longer, and stated I have been waiting an hour, another employee responded with \"everyone has been waiting an hour.\" The comment was completely uncalled for and shouldn't have been said. I don't care if \"everyone has been waiting an hour\", if that's the case then give a realistic wait time when a customer is calling in an order."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town on a business trip. Had a craving for a good white pizza homemade style. Mia Famiglia has very friendly staff. The white pizza that I ordered was fantastic. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"We use to love this place however the last two visits have really disappointed us. The first occurrence we ordered delivery for a large pizza and salads. The pizza was ice cold by the time it was delivered and we had to reheat. We decided to go in tonight and eat at the restaurant...it was not a better experience. The server brought our salads out without using a tray therefore her thumb was inside our bowl touching our food. The boys got kids chicken tender baskets that had beyond crispy chicken strips and fries. My fiancé ordered a soda which was flat. Then to top everything off, they lost our check and we couldn't leave until they found it so we could pay for this awful experience. It's sad because this use to be one of our favorite places to go but we have officially removed this from places to eat. Hopefully they will get better again but right now, I would pass."}
{"text":"I've done delivery and pickup. Their pizza is good but I really like their hot wings."}
{"text":"Stopped in an hour before close to order carryout.  Ordered and paid for an XL extra cheese pepperoni pizza to go.  After about 25 minutes of sitting I'm given a Large extra cheese pepperoni pizza (wrong size) and given 2 nasty reheated single slices of pizza to compensate for the error (given, as in \"here's your boxed up order you've already paid for and been waiting for this whole time...oh....we accidentally made you the wrong size pizza but instead of offering to refund you the difference or remake the pizza we're just gonna make it right by giving you these old would-be-thrown-away-at-close slices, reheated with the same toppings as your main pizza\")  These were the same old and cold slices I saw in the glass case when I'd arrived, just with extra cheese and pepperoni added on top and reheated.  That's crummy lazy business practices.  Pizza was average tasting, crust good, sauce bland, cheap cheese.  Just another \"NY/NJ\" pizza transplant to the Carolina's making average pizza that would never make it up north.  Save your money buy a Home Run Inn frozen pizza from Harris Teeter."}
{"text":"Pizza is decent. Not too greasy. Wings are decent as well. Do not get the garlic knots.  They are hard and tasted like they were leftover from the night before.  I asked for a fresh batch and they brought back out the same hard garlic knots.  The worst. Definitely skip the garlic knots. Otherwise decent place to eat."}
{"text":"True NY pizza! Terrific food and fabulous service!  Typical family Italian from Westchester! Best I've had in years!"}
{"text":"We eat here quite a bit.  The food is really good!  The pizza is great, thin crust, New York Style!  I also really enjoy they're salads.   I'm pretty sure the ranch dressing is homemade and it's delicious!  The Sicilian Stromboli is a So a big hit with my family.   Delivery is a little slow but it's in an easy location for take out so we usually just do that."}
{"text":"good local pizza place. NY/Italian cuisine. I usually get either the calzone or the Chicken roll which is pretty darn good. and when your craving a cannoli, they have them."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for pizza & a few appetizers with no problems.  I recently had pizza there & took home a chicken francese for dinner.  It went straight into the garbage.  It was pasta with the chicken on top.  There was no sauce in it, just goopy flour.  When I attempted to microwave it to heat it there was no liquid which proves it was all flour.  I don't know who made the food, but I have never seen something this bad.  Naturally the chicken now tasted like rubber since there was no sauce in it.  So to the garbage can it went.  A waste of money & I have to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"I called earlier in the day to make sure they could accommodate a large group. Thankfully, they could and the service was excellent. Orders were correct and easily separated. The food came out fast and hot. My Stromboli and the fried zucchini were really good. The pizza was tasty."}
