{"text":"Right to the point: the service was absolutely terrible, and the food was a joke as well.   I took a trip here with my buddy. First 2 minutes of sitting down I order up a water as I have a very serious health condition and am limited pretty much to water. I was told that if I wanted wings I have to order drinks. Near the end of my night my friend couldn't eat anymore of his wings so he gave them to me, I being as full as I was, decided to ask the waitress to get them in a box. She says \"no we can't do that, the owner would be pissed if I did that.\"   Honestly, if the owner is making up these stupid, ridiculous rules, he should pull his head out his ass and not be in hospitality. I will never go there again and will keep my family and friends away from this joke of a restaurant."}
{"text":"They offer free pool but all the pool cues are broken. Twice i've been there in the last 6 weeks, second time thinking that by now surley thhey would have replaced the cues! Not so lucky. This time the place was empty and our food took 30min to show up and had to seek out the waitress anytime we needed something. I like woodys elsewhere but this one is not worth your time."}
{"text":"Well where to begin. We just went there tonight (Wing Wednesday) Walked in at about 6pm and there were maybe 5 tables of people in there (not very busy at all) with two waitresses and one bartender. It took about 15 minutes to just get our menus and then another 15 minutes to get 2 beers and a club soda (there were three of us eating). Then after another 15 minutes we finally got to put in our order. After about 30 more minutes we finally got our wings which were on the cold side. Our waitress kept apologizing saying they were so swamped and busy and had no manager and the bartender and her were both new. Whatever. Even if its your first shift get your shit together. There was absolutely no excuse for her not using a tray and walking one drink at a time to everyones tables and literally throwing our wings on the table not telling us which flavour was which. The bartender disappeared and rarely made an appearance and when she did she never was pouring drinks. When our wings came we ordered another round and it took over 30 minutes to get it. We were basically done eating at that point and ready to explode. We were also given no napkins (its wings so its pretty much a given that we will be needing them) and my cousin asked for hot sauce which the waitress never brought so my cousin walked up to the kitchen to get it herself and us some napkins. At the end we had to go up to get our bills because she obviously wasn't going to bring them (should have just left without paying...they probably wouldn't even have noticed). Everyone in there either was leaving because they weren't getting waited on or had to go up to the bar or the kitchen to get anything that they wanted. Friggen Ridiculous! Then when we all get our bills they charged me $2.50 for EACH GLASS OF CLUB SODA! SERIOUSLY!! I was the DD so I wasn't drinking. I have NEVER been to a bar where i was the DD and had to pay for my pops or club soda ever and I can understand charging once and giving free refills but for each one?!?!?! SOme broad was up there when we went to pay and she was all like \"I even had to come in on my day off because its so busy\" Umm it wasn't busy at all! I was a bartender for 2 years at one of the busiest bars in town and we always pulled it together and got everyone their stuff on time! Learn to use a tray and learn to get your shit together! Don't give me some sob story about how you haven't gotten to go pee in an hour you seriously had like 5 tables to deal with all of which only had like 2 or 3 people at them...and for frig sakes get a better bartender! It would take literally 30 seconds for her to pour our three drinks...if you are a bartender then STAY AT THE BAR! Don't be going in the back constantly or be on the phone...seriously! I don't ever write reviews...this is honestly my first one because I was that disgusted in this place. We live super close and wanted to have my birthday there so wanted to try out the food before we had a party with 15+ people and trust you me we will NEVER GO THERE AGAIN! They missed out on a lot of money for years to come because of this. Train your staff properly and if it is a night like wing night don't have 2 brand new girls who have no friggen idea what they are doing and no manager or anyone else experienced...its called management for a reason....ok this has gone on long enough but seriously NEVER EAT THERE!!"}
{"text":"This place needs to be shut down. I havent been to a grosser place since the cecil was in its last days."}
{"text":"Just left Woody's. Waited 20 minutes and no service whatsoever! Tried to get the servers attention, since she was just a few tables down. Unfortunately to no avail."}
{"text":"The meal I ordered was just a huge plate of sadness.   If you like sharting please visit this place.   It'll leave you speechless.   The few bites that I ate of my lunch has rendered me sterile.    That's right I can no longer have children.   Thanks Woody's Taphouse for bringing garbage to the table.  I'd write a longer review if I didn't find myself sprinting to the bathroom yet again."}
{"text":"Its a Neighborhood pub If your in the area and want a pint and some wings its worth it, foods not bad, waitresses are just hot enough to make you think you have a chance when they flirt. I recommend it for what it is, a pu with food and beers during the game or a quick afternoon drunk."}
{"text":"Shelley on the day shift is a real sweetheart. What you see is what you get here. It's pub food, don't expect no hipster kale salads or anything. Show up, have a beer and a burger, watch some sports. You'll have a good time. Prices are pretty damned reasonable too."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years for late night drink. Perfect laid back bar to come and have a few beers. Staff changes often though due to management. Food here is typical bar food so I wouldn't be coming here for that. Play some pool (2 pool tables) VLT's, shoot-em-up buck hunter game, and an arcade-type golf game. Drink specials are usually pretty damn good too."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was the waitress we had. The rest was brutal. The \"chef\", and I will use that term lightly, was apparently having a bad day because he was slammed. 25 people for a capacity of 280 is not slammed. Brutal. The first addition of our order for 4 came out wrong, the second was inedible. The burgers were burnt to hell and could have been used for tomorrow's hockey game. Don't go here..."}
{"text":"Super huge portion for mexi nachos and this was the half size!!! I didn't really like the fact that so much had to go to waste because there is no way 2-3 people could have finished this. They need to charge $10 and make it a bit smaller instead of $17 for supersized half size and they charge an extra $4 for full size I can only imagine how many families that full size could feed! Other than the portion size complaint it was delicious"}
