{"text":"I went to check out Cadillac Jenkins last week. A buddy told me about it. Met a friend there. I'd been following the word on Instagram and you know what? Finally T. O. has a place like this. I mean, I walk in and I'm immediately greeted by the owner, Tyrone Gayle. He's friendly. Affable. Brings me right to a table. 

Let me give you an idea of what it's like inside. Intimate, chic and hip, if that makes any sense to you. Picture a space with toned down pod lights romantically enhanced by candles, a dark, sprawling, mirrored bar with countless beverages decorating it and the smooth soul stylings of D' Angelo on the turntable (yeah, the turntable) and that's Cadillac Jenkins. It must be pretty versatile as I heard there are other nights when the place really hops with a dance floor. I'd seen pictures of the food so I already knew what I was going to have: the fried jerk chicken sandwich on coco bread, a real twist on Caribbean food. 

This is one big sandwich, man. The chicken was fresh, perfectly seasoned, soft and tender on the inside which was directly opposed to the hearty crunch of its outside. Then you taste the jerk flavour on the back end of every bite. Washed down with a cold Red Stripe. All with a heap of creamy cole slaw right on the chicken just makes this, as well as the prompt and welcoming service, something you're going to want again the next time you come. 

And you will be back. Me? I'll try and pry myself away from the wicked fried chicken on coco bread and, with the very reasonable prices, dip into one of the other amazing items on the menu that I eyeballed as they passed by my table. The roti three ways, jerk pork tacos, shrimp and scallop Scotch eggs, beef patties rammed with jerk chicken and jerk  chicken and waffles are calling my name."}
{"text":"Really great Caribbean food (love that spice in the patty)with some good cocktails for this hood. Good little hidden gem in queen west."}
{"text":"Found this gem by accident while looking for a convenience store (downstairs). I had just ate dinner 15min ago but once I saw jerk pork taco I had to make room. It was hands down one of best jerk meals I've had. Highly recommended!! I will most likely try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Yummy food, definitely worth a try. Most notable items were Jerk chicken and ox tail croquettes!"}
{"text":"Really good food. Jerk chicken, beef patty, and the taco was so good. I don't know what that idiot in DineTO was taking about when he chirped the taco-I completely disagree MmmmK (see review) it was good and I knew how to eat it. It's also half price wine bottles on Wednesdays!!! Umm hellooooo"}
{"text":"Ordered their jerk chicken, coleslaw, and rice and peas through Foodora.  The jerk chicken was ok, the coleslaw didn't have enough sweet or saltiness, and the rice and peas was like a stew!  Not only that, the coleslaw as only enough for one person, and the rice and peas nonsense wasn't enough for even a child. Also, the \"whole jerk chicken\" we ordered arrived as chicken that was cut up in pieces, all dark meat without a bone in sight. I didn't mind, but my girlfriend was not impressed.

UPDATE: So I received a telephone call from \"Tyrone\" at Cadillac Jenkins and he apologized for the food, but explained to me that the rice and peas was a risotto.  I don't believe any Jamaican themed restaurant serves \"rice and peas risotto\", but if they did, they would make it a whole lot better.  The rice and peas I received had no risotto grains in it, did not taste like risotto, and had no risotto texture. It was a watery, tasteless stew of overdone rice with kidney beans sprinkled in.  He also said that the whole chicken was a mistake and it is only supposed to be 6 pieces of jerk meat.  Well, some people like white meat chicken, and all the pieces were dark meat, but there won't be any option to choose Tyrone said. 
He offered a meal on the house, which I declined.  Basically, he blamed the chef and took no responsibility for the quality control of the food.  

So if it all the chef's fault, I would say you need a new chef Tyrone."}
{"text":"Cadillac Jenkins brings a fresh vibe on Caribbean cuisine. I've had almost all their menu options including their beverage menu and everything is amazing! If you are in Toronto and want to experience something that brings food, flavour and experience all together come here for some late night \"vibes\". Koodos Cadillac Jenkins."}
{"text":"I  went here for my birthday last night based on a friend's recommendation and I was not disappointed! The owner was so kind, we chatted lot, he treated me like a queen for my bday! He made me off the menu cocktails with sorrel and grapefruit juice and we got the Jerk chicken share plate which was so delicious. Perfect vibe, great food and drinks, amazing staff. He even came and did a shot with us! Can't rave about this place enough, perfect date spot!"}
{"text":"Awesome little place. Fantastic selection of drinks and reasonably priced. Great decor and vibe. Didn't try the food, but it smelled delicious. DJ was also spinning sick beats at the perfect volume. Don't overlook this place, it can be easy to miss at this location. Up the stairs at queen and shaw."}
{"text":"Went to Cadillac Jenkins for dinner last night and it was fantastic. Cocktails were innovative and delicious. The jerk chicken was fall-off-the-bone good. Roti four ways was so filling and delicious. Great hospitality too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"After being treated to a Yelp event here months ago, I decided to go back when I was in the area with my friends as we just wanted a small bite to tide us over for a bit.  We came around 5pm and were the only ones there (dinner crowd not there yet).  I wanted to have some of those oxtail rice balls that they had served at the event but I was sadly told they don't do them anymore.

I'm sorry but this needs to be changed!  Those were YUMMY and need to immediately go back on the menu!   Our table ordered the jerk tacos, beef patty (don't remember the exact name of it).  Everything was good - not great, but good.  

The service was especially lovely though - our server was very friendly and answered all our questions.  The drinks are STRONG  :)

I believe on Friday/Saturday night they have a DJ spinning - that's probably the best time to go!  The d√©cor is pretty awesome as well - a throwback to your youth :)"}
{"text":"Overall, a nice chill place that takes a contemporary and unique approach to Caribbean food. I think my only fault was that I went in there with a different expectation (my girlfriend and I went there for dinner), when it is definitely more of a loungey and drinks type of place, not so much of a full-fledged restaurant per-se. 

Service 5/5 - Good service, the waiter serving us was very polite and helpful, asked us how our meal was and refilled our water frequently. 

Food 3/5 - The food was good, but it was underwhelming at the same time. We ordered the Jerk Chicken and the Oxtail Croquette. Although I understand that we ordered from the \"Snacks\" section, I still expected a bit more, especially for what I was paying (and I guess my experiences with other Caribbean joints). I believe that the Jerk Chicken was only a drumstick and a thigh + some slaw (someone please correct me if I am wrong, I am writing this review post-dated), and then the Oxtail Croquettes were kind of small and there was barely any meat inside them. The food was not even hot (it was warm), and we ended up going somewhere else after Cadillac Jenkins to sate our hunger.

Price 2.5/5 - Hard to justify what we paid for, especially due to the fact that there were so many other restaurants nearby that would have provided better food and/or a lower price."}
