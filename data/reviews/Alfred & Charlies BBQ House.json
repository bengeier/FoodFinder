{"text":"Saw this listed in State Magazine as a great breakfast stop.  BBQ seems to be their claim to fame....but breakfast is serves all day.  My wife went with the traditional eggs, grits, bacon while I went for the State Magazine recommended French Toast.  Indeed, our breakfast was very good with nice...folksy down-home service.  I think everyone who worked there spoke to me before I left.  As for BBQ...that will be another trip...but a positive sign was the large pile of hickory wood stacked out back!"}
{"text":"Well after driving by this location over 10 years my wife and I decided to try this cozy little place out for lunch. We arrived about 1:00pm. The location is situated right next to a convenient store off New Hope road. We stepped into the place an older home converted into a barb q joint. Decor was friendly like being in a bed and breakfast style restaurant with a lot of country flair. Hard wood tables with the quintessential vinyl  checkered table clothes. The place had only 4 tables occupied by fellow patrons. A nice gentleman came by after about a 3 min wait took drink order and brought out about 5 hush puppies saying that some more were cooking. We did not receive menus. My wife got up and retrieved  2 menus. After a few minutes our server came by with our drinks and ask if we were ready. After seeing the menu online before we left the house my wife decided to try the daily lunch special of fried chicken and 2 sides. Upon requesting it the server informed her he did not know of any specials. So she places an order for a hamburger steak green beans and a baked potato. I ordered a large barb q sandwich with fries and barb q slaw.  After about 5 minutes we received our additional hush puppies. After another 15 minutes our food arrived. The barb q sandwich was piled high but the meat was disappointing. It had a very sour mushy taste not a smoky meaty taste as great barb q has. I received a small bag of chips no fries. The slaw was a little tangy for my taste but edible. The hamburger steak was a little dry green beans bland but the baked potato was hot and fluffy. Refills for are drinks were great we never had to want or ask. We did not receive our check at the end of the meal and went up to the register did not wait long and checked out. Total price without tip $17.21. We will probably not be back we have a lot of local choices that really have a better selection and service. It had all the makings of a great little country cooking barb q place but just did not deliver."}
{"text":"The magazine \"Our State\" recently did a cover story on 25 great places to eat breakfast in North Carolina.  Alfred and Charlie's was one of the spots mentioned.  So I hopped in the car and headed west.

The restaurant is located in a yellow house less than two miles from the New Hope Road exit off of 85.  As I walked in, I was greeted by Alfred and he welcomed me to their house.  We talked for a few minutes as we walked back to the main dining room (which I believe would be considered the living room) and he told me to sit anywhere.  On my way back to the dining room, I was offered coffee by the waitress, but I declined.  I picked out a table and Alfred and I continued to chat for a few minutes, before he moved on to greet other patrons.

I ordered the regular french toast plate, which consisted of four wedges of french toasts, two eggs and a choice of meat.  i also ordered a side of home fries.  While waiting for my food, I did some work and chatted on and off with Alfred.  My food arrived after about 15 minutes.  I had selected the french toast because it had been mentioned in the magazine article.  It did not disappoint.  The french toast was pillowy-soft.  And I mean that in a good way.  It wasn't dense in any way, but it had depth of flavor.  Really, really good.  The eggs were eggs, and the livermush was livermush.  The home fries were nothing to look at, but they ended up being pretty decent.  To the point where I wish I had gotten a double-order.

I paid the bill at the counter as I left and told Alfred that I would be back.  I have to go back.  He's bringing a book in for me.  If you're looking for a good breakfast, and you're in the neighborhood, consider stopping by.  The food is good and the hospitality is something special."}
