{"text":"The place needs serious cleaning. One look at their water pitcher's accumulated dirt would quench your thirst. For days. Service is non-existent. There's only a single staff member who doubles as  greeter (or not), cashier, server, food stocker.  The food may be decent,  but my hunger somehow deserted me the moment I walked in.  
Disappointed. And remember to carry a bottle  of water with you."}
{"text":"Small place, food is very good, highly recommended.  Buffet does not have large selection but taste is excellent.  Tandoori chicken and butter chicken very good."}
{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place for a sit down even though I have seen people do that (all you can eat for $7 why not)  but the takeout is excellent. For $5.50 you can get yourself a veggie thali to die for, and if you have random guests coming over, just get any of their entrees to go with naan/roti and your guests will thank you forever.

Cheap- yes! Good - Yes! did I mention the 3 samosas for $1? :D"}
{"text":"Love their twist to the Chicken 65.  Good service and decent food.  Have still not tried their buffet"}
{"text":"Amazing food ! We had food catered for 20 people. I was very unsure of the restaurant but the quality and quantity of food  was amazing.
I ordered vegetarian currys, tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, fish pakora & everything tasted so good. People even took a lot of food home because they gave such a good quantity. 
I would def. recommend this place for catering. They made my party a hit ;)"}
