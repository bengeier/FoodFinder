{"text":"Went to taste product, sign said back in 5 mins. waited 20, phoned and told they would open in a few mins. Left after another 5 mins, really

Thanks for the response, we will try again, I strongly support local business starting up in tough market."}
{"text":"Burwood is one of my favourite spots for a cocktail. The space is fantastic for a casual drink or for an evening with friends. You can sit at the bar or head upstairs to a more cozy, living room vibe with couches and chairs. 
The service is always fantastic, the owners obviously love what they're doing and have every reason to be proud of their work. The bartender is great, super friendly and knowledgable and good conversation. 
The honey eau de vie is my favourite, but everything is good, even the gin (and I'm not a gin fan). The seasonal spirits were super tasty as well. The mixed drinks are an excellent presentation for the products. 
I'm excited to stop by when the kitchen officially opens. 
I recommend Burwood to everyone, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I just love it here! Come here after work, but I would go out of my way to come here anyway. Love the cocktails, ambiance, service or bartender London! He makes my mojitos just a bit sweeter! Just met a new gal here Nina, she's nice and knowledgeable! They have fancy glasses, and a cool place to sit upstairs but the furniture is extra cool ask them where it's from, it's super cool!!! Only thing missing is food, but a little birdie told me next week it's open with a menu!!! I love they do tours of the distillery in the back and you can get a Groupon to try it out! But regular price is $15 with a tasting! Come check it out and tell them I sent you!
Food is here and so far so good fried cauliflower the best!! All food and dressings are handmade fresh and chef is kind and awesome!"}
