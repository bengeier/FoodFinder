{"text":"If I'm in Champaign, I make it a point to swing by Radio Maria. Really great food and some great options if you're a vegetarian."}
{"text":"The overall experience of Sunday brunch was a large disappointment. This was the 4th time I've eaten Sunday brunch at this location, and they have each gotten progressively worse. The drink order took about 30 minutes to arrive, and when they came the bloody marys were watered down with no seasoning. Basically tomatoe sauce with water. We let the waitress know and we changed our drink order. This was before the food arrived. Some 30 minutes later our food came. The food was delicious. We ate, it was good. After we had all finished our meals the drinks we had re-ordered showed up (more than a little late, obviously). Overall, the food was great, but Sunday brunch should not take 2 hours. I will wait a while before I go back, and hopefully Radio Maria will get their act together."}
{"text":"I feel blessed whenever I eat here. The vibe is cool, and the food is great. All of it. Brunch especially--I got the pulled pork sandwich with sautéed kale, cheese, and bacon and I basically cried of happiness twice. Would repeat."}
{"text":"The good:

 - the decor. It's cool on one side; wood-warm and artistic on the other.
- the food, when it works.

The bad:

 - the food, which mostly doesn't work. It's all over the map, fusing foods from every which corner. I like fusion menus just fine, but the trick with them is that the tastes have to get along with each other. Radio Maria's often behave like they've never met, never wanted to meet, and hate each other when they do meet. The result is tastes which stomp on each other in needlessly complicated food. 

- the service. I second whoever wrote that it's hipper-than-thou. Apparently, no one is cool enough to be in Radio Maria, much less get competent, friendly service. Just ask the wait staff - if you can get their attention. We couldn't."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now. The experience was never spectacular, but last night was remarkably bad. I was part of a large party (with reservations, so they knew we were coming). I know large groups put some strain on the kitchen, but this was ridiculous. After waiting and waiting for our food while the other three parties in the dining room got served, we finally asked and were given a very dismissive \"it's a small kitchen\" and no apology. Another 15 minutes past and we finally got food. 
I wish the food saved things, but it was just ok. My cod (which as listed came with an array of vegetables. tomatoes! Fennel!) was dry and covered in nothing but mushrooms. I was starving after waiting 40+ minutes and ate it anyway. 
Then they started grabbing plates left and right. The way they cleared our plates, you'd think they were rushing us out, ironically enough. We had to beg for a dessert menu (twice). As soon as we ordered, we regretted it, dreading another long wait. And we weren't wrong. It was quite a while until we received our round of half-frozen macaron. 
Between this and a failed Valentine's day reservation, I think I've finally had it (we had to wait at the bar for half an hour for our table to be ready - I was unfortunately on medication and couldn't drink, making me feel like an awkward and unwanted space filler)."}
{"text":"Awesome decor - heard that the owner customized everything himself.

The food was very good, not amazing but definitely among the better culinary experiences available in the Urbana-Champaign area.  One caveat is that the portions are rather small."}
{"text":"Ordered the Paella - expensive, small portion, and not at all a traditional paella. Perhaps they were trying to be creative, which I would have no problem with, if it tasted good. It did not."}
{"text":"I'd love to say Radio Maria is my favorite restaurant and give it 5 stars.  After all, they have awesome sangria and great sunday brunch.  The fig appetizers on their dinner menu are fantastic, but their dinner entrées are  hit or miss.  The tapas also taste great, but they always make me terribly sick afterward.  I'll keep coming back for dinner, though I think I've given up on the tapas for good."}
{"text":"I am having a hard time deciding between giving Radio Maria two and three stars.  Ultimately I decided on three stars because the service is decent.  The food is nothing to write home about.  We had a couple of appetizers that took a long time to bring to our table.  Our server was pleasant but seemed bored and/or distracted.  I don't plan on going back any time soon.  There are several other places downtown that are much better (i.e. Big Grove and Bacarro).  Not a bad place but not great either."}
{"text":"This place has really taken a dive. The first major problem is the service. I brought my family from South America for brunch and they don't speak English. It was a large group.  It could have been this nice memory for all of us-- it was our first restaurant meal together in the States. The waiter had nothing but utter contempt for us, including a toddler who was with us. He was annoyed that we were taking pictures and that our relatives were struggling with the menu. I felt so embarrassed and uncomfortable-- I should have just walked out. The other problem is the food. It is often room temp or cold the last few times I've been there. This salmon is fishy. The eggs Benedict was cold and flavorless. Too bad-- a great CU location."}
{"text":"The food has always been top-notch. I go there regularly for tapas and on the weekends for brunch. The service and staff are all very friendly and accommodating. I've noticed some other reviews noting the service was a bit slow, but I've never had any complaint about the speed. The environment there is also quite enjoyable; albeit a bit hispter-ish. But I wouldn't let that deter you. 

Overall, I don't think you'll be disappointed here. Solid 4/5"}
{"text":"Unique place.  You won't find anything like it.  Has a full resturant and a apas bar.  Great food, and truly excellent service.  Easily the most interesting place in central Illinois.  Really."}
{"text":"Dirty. Dirty. Dirty. This USED TO BE a class act. Not anymore. Drunk waitresses, inept bartenders, trashed patrons and worn out ambiance. Sad and filthy. Food is overrated and under portioned for the price.  Better to go to Barrelhouse or Hamilton Walkers. At least there, it's not sticky and greasy."}
{"text":"Seems like the only Spanish restaurant in C-U area? Foods are good. But the price is a little bit high since it locates at downtown Champaign."}
{"text":"The pace of service is nothing to write home about, but the food is delicious. Such a fun place to have tapas. The paella is a MUST."}
{"text":"I wish I could give the wait staff 1 star and the food a 4. I've been here 5 times, mostly for brunch.  The waiters are my least favorite part of Radio Maria. That said, the prices are reasonable at brunch, so go on the weekends if you decide to check the restaurant out.  

There are never enough people working at brunch.  We always have to flag someone down to order, to figure out where our drinks are, to get refills on our coffee, the list goes on and on.  The food has been quite good; I loved the Torta Maria, the blackened salmon, and their soups, while overpriced, have been excellent.  The masa boat was a little dry, but the flavors were well-balanced.  I went once for dinner.  The food was good, but unremarkable.  I had the Korean hot pot.  It was good, but I wasn't expecting it to be sweet.  The portion sizes were also tiny.  For half the cost, I could have gotten twice as much food at B-Won.

I don't drink alcohol, so I can't say anything about their drinks, but my friends say they have one of the best-stocked bars in town and the weeknight bartender is excellent."}
{"text":"We went to Radio Maria last night for dinner before seeing a show at the High Dive. We ordered a few tapas and an entree to share. We had the arancini, the pork tacos the manchego and apple salad, the maria torta and the black bean patty. Most of the food was wonderful and I would definitely order it again, however the black bean patty was inedible. We were excited to try to because our friends had eaten it before and recommended it however, there was absolutely no seasoning at all, it was completely flavorless and I would not order it again. The other downfall was the service, our waitress was extremely unfriendly and acted like she did not want us there. When we got to dessert, my friend asked her about the gelatos of the day and she did not know what they were. My friend decided to order them anyway. The dessert took 20 minutes to come out and when the waitress brought it, she literally set it down not explaining anything. I would love to go back to enjoy the food and the atmosphere it's a wonderful restaurant, I just think that certain members of the waitstaff need a change in attitidue"}
{"text":"This is probably my go-to restaurant in Champaign.  Honestly, I don't really like most tapas restaurants, as I usually walk away from an expensive meal that leaves me hungry.  Not  the case at Radio.  They have a diverse menu, and pretty much everything is very good.  They technically have two kitchens, one traditional and one tapas (you can order from either or both).  Prices can be high for the prime dishes, but if that is not your thing, there are plenty of other options (tacos, tortas, etc.).

The place itself is very cool.  I like downtown Champaign, and this is one of the nicer spaces.  The bar side has a modernist feel to it (blue lights under the bar, abstract art), while the dining area is a little more classic.  The bar is truly outstanding.  They probably have the best beer tap rotation in town (yes, that's right) and it's constantly changing.  Probably 25+ beers on tap, and good nightly drink specials.  This is usually one of my top late-night options for that reason, along with DJ Belly on the tables (old school hip-hop is usually on rotation after 10 pm). 

The food always pleases. My favorite is the paella, but they will put out a good beef tenderloin or other special on occasion that has always impressed.  The chef there is very talented, and the staff in general is very courteous.  If it gets crowded, you might be in for a long meal, but that doesn't really bother me much for this type of place.  We have done birthdays, graduation dinners, or stopped by at 1 am drunk as a night-cap.  It's a very versatile place that can appeal to a variety of tastes.  Definitely the most unique place in town, and should be at the top of anyone's Champaign restaurant lists."}
{"text":"First time at Radio Maria. Had brunch on a busy Sunday. Our waitress was pleasant, attentive, and fast. I had the Smoked Pork Torta and it was fantastic. The only minor complaint is that the mojito was too sweet and overpriced for the size. Would like to go back again."}
{"text":"The first time my husband and I came to check out Champaign before moving here, we stopped into Radio Maria's for brunch, it was GREAT! Our server who I wish I remembered his name was fantastic! 

Now that we live here we decided to go out for a really nice dinner, and thought this place would be a great choice. I am sorry to say I was a bit disappointed, in the food and the service.  I love the atmosphere there, however that can only entertain you so long, our food took at least and hour before it came out. We did have the baked brie for and appetizer which came out straight away, but then we waited, and waited, and waited for our main entree. Finally I think our server who at this point I was sure had vanished, came to our table and explained the delay. That was 45 minutes later mind you.  If he had told us initially that our meals would be slower coming out I would have been more understanding, however when you are starving and you see people who sat after you being served and getting their bill and you don't see your server anywhere, you start to wonder what's up.

I would likely go back for the brunch, but may try dinner somewhere else, hence the 3 stars."}
{"text":"We used to love the place because it is one of the few places that you can get paella in Champaign. However, last night when we were there, the rice of the paella we ordered is not fully cooked. It was stiff and hard to chew. Although they sent it back to re-cook, the rice still comes back partially done. We ended up canceling the order. This is unbelievable. It seems that they cannot manage to get the rice cooked and the chef failed to solve the problem! We were very disappointed at the paella and will definitely not come back to the restaurant again!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place has really changed, now they occupy two spaces instead of one. One space is for formal dining, while the other is more casual and laid back. We sat across a huge purple bar. The menu was much different than I remembered.  Instead of entrees like half chickens with grilled plantains, etc. they offered Tapas, which we didn't mind at all. In fact, we love Tapas. The best Tapas we ordered was the vegetarian paella. I wished the paella was served on a big platter like in Spain, but it was just in a tiny side dish, which I understand is part of the whole Tapas mentality, but still I wished they'd offer it on the menu as a main dish. The margarita I ordered was spot on. Not to strong, not to watered down. And their prices are extremely reasonable. We spent $47.00 without tip for six tapas, two margaritas, and one dessert, which we shared. I still love Radio Maria's, but I like the decor on the older side better."}
{"text":"I have been to Radio Maria before and had good experiences, but it has been a few years.  I took my family there for dinner during graduation weekend since I had just graduated from law school.

I understand that graduation weekend in Chambana can be really crazy.  However, the service we got was unacceptable.  We ate dinner at a different restaurant in downtown Champaign the night earlier and did not have anywhere near the problems we had at Radio Maria.  Our water glasses were constantly empty, the waiter would go a half hour or more without stopping by our table, he would forget to do things we requested (i.e. fill our water glasses), etc.  The restaurant is also EXTREMELY noisy.

Given the prices at the restaurant, we really expected better.  Further, although most of our food was pretty good, my grandparents could not eat the hanger steak they ordered to share.  My grandparents cannot do spicy food and the steak ended up being totally caked in a pepper crust.  The bottom of the menu says items on the menu contain ingredients that are not listed, but that is in very small letters and I didn't even notice it.  Apparently, my 90+ year old grandparents didn't notice it either.  My boyfriend tried the steak and said it was pretty spicy, so it seems strange that the fact that the meal is spicy isn't on the menu.

My grandpa also got meat that was not good quality.  It was very tough and he said it was inedible.  The restaurant handled the problem graciously, however, and took the steak off the bill which we appreciated.

Nevertheless, it is unlikely I would go back to Radio Maria or even recommend it to other people.  I will be here for several more months while I study for the bar and even though I always thought of this place as one of the nicer restaurants in town, I was really disappointed.  There are restaurants in Chambana that have great food for better prices."}
{"text":"Radio Maria is a great off campus place to go because it has a different atmosphere than other places on campus. The food is pretty good, but the tapas I was not impressed by.  They were missing alot of key tapas meals, and the waitress we had the last time we went was very ditzy. None of our drinks were refilled, and it took forever to order.  

Will prolly go back and hope that it's a little better. I really did like the atmosphere, and the food has potential."}
{"text":"I usually get the Torta Maria. It's one of the more unique vegetarian options that you'll find when eating out. Also, it is something that is enjoyed by non-vegetarians alike.

Radio Maria has something for everyone, and definitely puts a unique spin on the usuals. Think, Coffee-crusted pork, wasabi mashed potatoes, vanilla bean sauce on your tortillas...

I have fallen in love with just about everything I've eaten here!

The desserts are also excellent. Most recently, I tried the flourless chocolate cake, which was no exception.

Service started off okay, but the restaurant got busy and service subsided. There may have only been one server for the whole restaurant during prime dinner hours."}
{"text":"Awful place. 

If you are trying to go there for good drinks this is an OK place to go to but the food was horrible. The tapas ceviche was $10 which came with 4 shrimp and was topped with popcorn (I have no idea why). If they were trying to go for fun and innovative food this place completely missed the mark. The potatoes and chorizo came in an extremely small portions and where bland. Not to mention the paella which was $25 and the rice was not well cooked. This place takes small portions to a new level. Overall I left that place with $80 less and still hungry. Not worth the money and the food was a complete disappointment. The only reason this place is getting two stars is because of their drinks."}
{"text":"Radiomaria can be summed up easily: Top tier wine, beer and food without the snobby attitude usually associated with such quality."}
{"text":"I visited Radio Maria nearly 4 years ago with some friends after a Salsa dance lesson, and I  could not remember the name of this place for the life of me. I am from Danville/Champaign  area, and I drove by this place all the time in the daylight, and I never even noticed it. It's definitely for \"friends\" after hours.

I remember I had the Arancini....holy crap was it DELICIOUS!!! 

The vibe was chill and trendy. A bit upscale for my liking...but eh, to each his/her own. I personally believe the restaurant needs to do more food advertisement, because I think the only thing that either my friends, acquaintances, or myself believe the reason that this place gets any business is because their bar service on the patio after dark."}
{"text":"Best bartenders in town! Food is amazing, and if Matt is your waiter it is your lucky day!! Otherwise? Cross your fingers, host thinks he is making you a favor by giving u a table (when they are empty), and our second waiter knew we were hungry but forgot to bring a menu. Matt!!! Can you please train the rest of the staff on how to be wonderful?"}
{"text":"I had a seafood paella, which gave me stomach problems for the next few days. I eat seafood on a daily basis, so it was pretty disappointing that these guys didn't seem to have cooked it thoroughly enough. The portion was also super small given the price. Overall, I won't probably go back here again."}
{"text":"Oh Radio Maria, how I wish we could be in love.

Radio Maria is like the girl your friends try to set you up with.  You hear how beautiful, how wonderful she is.  Then you meet her, only to find out she bites her fingernails during dinner.

This restaurant has all the makings of a high class experience.  It has a pretty bar with house-infused liquor.  (I especially love the ginger vodka.)  There is a large tapas menu, a full service restaurant, and even a hostess!

However, that's where the magical journy ends.  You enter the restaurant only to be told to wait.  You may, if you're like me, point out all of the empty tables and ask \"why can't I sit there?\"  \"Well,\" says the snooty hostess, \"those are reserved.\"  Really?  You have half of your restaurant empty and those are all reserved?  Ok, I'll bite.  Yes, we'll be happy to sit at the bar and have a drink and wait for \"about 15 minutes.\"

At the bar, we order two delicious drinks.  They're made well, even though it took a little longer than it should considering there were three people behind the bar.  We decided to ask for the tapas menu so we'd be ready to order.  Sure, I don't mind that this one has food spilled on it.  

After about 20 minutes of staring at the menu, not having any contact with the bartenders and certainly not seeing our promised table, we left, paying only for the expensive, but tasty, drinks.

Will we go back?  Well....no."}
{"text":"A great lunch and brunch place, but I'm less impressed by their dinner fare.

I mostly go here for brunch and the food rarely disappoints. The torta Maria and smoked port torta are unusual and always good. Each week the brunch specials usually include a special omelette, scrambler, and a sandwich. The omelettes are only OK; somehow they seem a bit dry and overcooked.

My main complaint with brunch is the coffee. For my past several visits it's been quite weak and it's hard to get a refill. At a weekend brunch, I do expect good, hot coffee and not to go 20 minutes with my cup empty.

For dinner, I think Radio is trying to present itself as more upscale and trendy than it is. A few years ago, the menu had a much more pronounced Carribean/Cuban/South American flair to it, and I miss that. I'm sure everything on the menu is very well-prepared, but it all seems like dishes I can get at any number of places.

For my last dinner experienced there, I had a tenderloin special. It consisted of two pieces of tenderloin, one correctly medium, one well-done; six gnocchi (I counted); and a scattering of green peas. I believe the sauce mentioned in the description was absent. We did have a large party, but we were sitting at an empty table for nearly an hour before our food was ready; no salads, no bread. I guess we were expected to order cocktails and appetizers. Everything was tasty and was artistically arranged on an appropriately-trendy rectangular plate, but the portions were quite small. I shouldn't leave a restaurant after a $30 entree feeling a bit peckish.

I feel like Radio can't decide what it is. A fancy drink bar? A tapas bar? A haute cuisine restaurant? It does all those things fairly well, but none of them exceptionally."}
{"text":"Love their sides!!! Corn bread..cinnamon cake..fried banana...French toast!!! We almost ordered all the sides!!!! I love the cream cheese on the cinnamon cake!! God!!!it was fabulous!!!! And for the drinks..Turkish coffee tastes just like unmelted sugared Americano.....lol...My cousin and I shared salmon omelette, it was great!!especially love the cheese inside the omelette!!! It tasted so good that I finished it all!!! And the waitress is friendly!!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here and was recommended lobster eggs benedict. Their Hollander sauce was pretty good but the dish wasn't anything exceptional and the portion was really small. For a $13 brunch dish, I would expect more portion and a better taste. I also tried their caprese omelet and it was too garlicky. I wouldn't go there for their brunch."}
{"text":"My SO and I made our Valentine's Reservations here, and were extremely happy.

The Good:
-The goat cheese, the goat cheese, the goat cheese!! We had several tapas and one appetizer, and the fried goat cheese was our favorite, so delicious and creamy, and it is served with a light jam that makes a wonderful combination.
-The pork tacos were also delicious, and obviously slow cooked, very delicious.
-The service was excellent, especially for how busy everything was (they were tripled booked for Valentine's).
-The homemade ricotta gnudi were also delicious, especially with the sauteed mushrooms that accompanied it. 
-We also ordered a flight of ice cream that featured a mint chocolate cake flavor which was extremely aromatic, and smelled like I was walking through an herb garden, delicious. 

The Meh:
-Personally, I was not a fan of the arancini, to me all I could taste was a fried greasy taste.

Overall:
-Would definitely return! Especially for date night, it's a fantastic place."}
{"text":"I love the traditional dining at Radio Maria.

Does it sometimes take longer than other restaurants?  yes... but that makes it more enjoyable and relaxing.  It is nice to sit outside and have a nice, paced dinner.

I'm always pleased with the specials.  The service is attentive without being overbearing.  I would recommend RM for couples wanting a nice dinner out."}
{"text":"*hearts-in-eyes emoji goes here*

I absolutely LOVE Radio Maria. I have only had tapas one time previous to this place, and that was in Barcelona. The atmosphere, decor, and food is downright enchanting. If you want to wow your first date - don't come here. They will fall in love with this restaurant and probably forget all about you. 

Ok but enough cheesiness, the food is great, even for a vegetarian like myself. I can't get enough of this place. I will say that the service was nothing to rave about - but it wasn't horrible. It also can be difficult to get a reservation/table on many nights - but that's a testament to how great it is."}
{"text":"This is definitely NOT a place to go for a special occasion.  We made a 6:00 reservation at this place six months ago for my sister's graduation.  After our arrival at 5:57, we waited 50 minutes without explanation to be seated, notwithstanding the abundance of empty tables in the dining room (and the fact that, um, we made dinner reservations months ago).  Finally the maître d, led us to our table: a drafty pub table right next to the bathroom in the crowded bar.  Really?  This is where you seat a family of 5 with reservations for an early dinner, after you've made them wait for the better part of an hour?  Then, throughout our entire dinner the maitre d walked by our table shouting the names of other parties as their tables became available.  

The food was good and our server was nice, but none of that made up for the inexplicable wait, the terrible table and the rude host.  Maybe if you show up at a restaurant with no reservation on a Saturday night, you should shrug off such disappointments.  But when you phone a restaurant months in advance and tell them you want to spend your special evening there, you expect them to at least refrain from sabotaging it.  Radio Maria falls short of this expectation.  We will not return."}
{"text":"Delicious food, lovely atmosphere. One of my top 5 restaurants in Champaign-Urbana!

The roast chicken, fish tacos, and coffee filet are some of my favorite entre's that I've enjoyed here. The food is good quality, and the flavor always delicious!

Tapas menu: the frog's legs (mmm, honey) and roasted asparagus are some of my favorites. A few of the tapas items lack flavor; but in general you won't be disappointed.

The desserts I've had are lovely; with good flavor and pretty presentation. The portions of everything are very good - not too much food, but plenty to satisfy you.

The wait staff has always been nice and helpful, if a bit distracted sometimes. Friendly people, good service.

It's definitely one of my favorite restaurants, I go whenever I get the chance, and recommend it to anyone!

Note: Many people have reviewed Radio Maria negatively. I think they need to put it in context of local restaurants. We're in Champaign-Urbana, not New York or Seattle. While we should have high standards, we just don't have the variety (and therefore competition) to create a large foody restaurant culture. I also think they need to stop being so negative. I've had a lovely meal and experience every time I've been to RM; I believe you get out of a place what you put into it (as long as it's moderately good, and this is much better than that). Viva Radio Maria! :)"}
{"text":"I like Radio Maria. The ambience is nice, the waiters/owners are friendly, and I like their drinks and food. I recently went this past week, and snacked on hummus with roasted veggies and pita, patatas, and cheescake. The hummus is sooo good- and they serve it with toasted pita. The patatas were just okay, but I'm pretty sure I burnt off all of my tastebuds when I tried them, so that may be why I can't give them a decent description. The cheesecake was delicious. I drank orange frescas, and did a lemon drop shot. It was very good- I was w. a group of about 10 people, and the service was speedy and friendly. Please please go here over Boltini- much less pretentious."}
{"text":"Always a good place to go with friends/family from out of town for it's vegetarian friendly menu."}
{"text":"I remember when this place opened. The food was creative, combining the familiar and unfamiliar, fearlessly taking us a step into spiciness or other realms. Staff were humans who treated customers as if they were a recognizable species. Meals were fun. Of course they became popular - a non-chain in the historic downtown with wonderful food and a great personality. This was a place I would recommend when we wanted to take visitors from either coast - a micro-urbane feel and a diverse menu with even a vegetarian section in the menu. 

But now? A facade that seems to be happy with the graduates of Applebees. I walk by this place almost angry that there are people with standards so low to let this place get away with bland food, indeterminate waits, and bad service, so much it has to expand.

But hey, if someone wants you to try it and you're reading this, don't loose heart - it is way better than some chain restaurant - it doesn't suck.  I can see that a lot of people are eating there, so good on them.  My problem is I remember how much better it once was. I miss the unique, creative, and delicious food in a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Falling Fast.  

I've been going to Radio Maria since it opened and have likely gone for dinner for the last time.  The menu, once a delightful mix of cultures and influences, and the sort of place where there was nothing bad on the menu, has been getting progressively smaller and less capable as the years have gone on.  

Drinks are good, Tapas is \"meh\" and pricey, dinner...no...and pricey.  We went last week and I ordered salmon which arrived with sweet potato chips - and a huge fried egg on top.  The fish was okay at best and the odd attempts at nouvelle cuisine were amusing - but tasteless in every sense of the word.

In a market as competitive as C-U, I don't see how they can continue this based on anything but location and alcohol.  Pity to see an old favorite fall this far."}
{"text":"Radio Maria is at the top of the restaurant heap in Chambana for dinner.  Top 5 at least.  Haven't been for lunch and I haven't experienced the tapas yet.  

I LOVE the atmosphere because it is understated and eclectic at the same time.  I love it when a restarant has the confidence to quietly state its intent rather than screaming \"look at my personality!!!!!!!\"  The radio hostess stand is lovely.  And I'm a sucker for their Crass-esque vintage graphic design.

Excellent wine selection.  The Reisling and Gewuiztraminer are my favorites.

The service has always been friendly without being intrusive.

My food has always been cooked perfectly.

I can't say I agree with the claims that the menu is uninspired.  The coffee crusted filet with espresso drizzle and savory vanilla sauce is not exactly something you can get anywhere.  I think there is a fine line in a place like Champaign between daring and scary.  You can tell by the popularity of places like Olive Garden in this town does not have the most adventurous pallate.  Fennel, Saffron, hearts of palm, plantain, poblano chilis, mole... these ingredients are all \"hot\" in celebrity cuisine scene and at the same time pallatable items for most people.  It might not be truffles and quail eggs, but it is modern and accessible.  

Oh yeah, and delicious."}
{"text":"By far our favorite spot we've eaten at so far in Champaign. Our server was a little strange - definitely new to the job - but the food was excellent and the service was completely reasonable. Very large beer selection as well. Highly recommend - we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Let me start this off by saying I'm a VERY cheap eater. I'm definitely the kind of person that would rather sit on the curb next to a taco truck stuffing myself with a $6 burrito than go to a fancy restaurant (the kind of place where you don't where cargo shorts) where there's more empty space on my plate than food. That being said, of all the more expensive places to eat around town, Radio Maria takes the cake for me. First off, the restaurant has a GREAT atmosphere. The setting/lighting is damn near perfect and they have great outside seating if the weather is nice. There's weird kitschy crap all over the walls and table too, which I mean as compliment. On top of that I've never had anything but a pleasant experience dealing with the staff. All the waiters/waitresses and hosts were extremely friendly and conversational. 

But really though, how's the food? 

Well, it's also great. Every time I look at the menu (for tapas especially) it's a lot of fun. For those who don't know there are two menus regularly available here, one that is a more traditional appetizer/entree menu and on that is for tapas dishes. There's good variety in terms of vegetarian and non-veggie dishes and the prices aren't outrageous for a place of this caliber. The paella is a definite must every time I go and on one day of the week (Tuesday?) they have 1/2 off wine bottles! Speaking of booze they have a full bar and a great selection of wines and beers as well as house infused liquors rotating every week or so which is really neat. While cocktails are always the thing to break the bank sometimes I just can't resist! All in all this is a great restaurant and one of my favorite CU establishments. I certainly won't be dining there very often but on a special occasion they're always high up on my list of options.

P.S. I've heard from a number of sources that their weekend brunch is both delicious and slightly more affordable than their regular weekday selections. If/when I verify this I'll make sure to update my review."}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner once. It was decent.

The other day I decided to try them for brunch. I've heard from a lot of people that their brunch is good. The place was certainly busy. The other people in my party got more brunch-y items like omelets and they all looked good.

I got two sides: a plantain and applewood-smoked bacon. 

The plantain was meh. 

The bacon was horrible. Absolutely horrible. It was as if they microwaved the bacon, over-cooking it so that there was no flavor and not a drop of grease on it. Another person at our table ordered bacon and his bacon was the same. There's no way I would have served bacon like that to guests in my home.

Radio Maria does not know how to cook bacon. And if they don't know how to cook bacon, one of the pillars of brunch, then I can't imagine that anything else would be worth trying."}
{"text":"Excellent food, decent service. Took us a while to get our food but when it came it was excellent. Portions are great and very filling. I had the breakfast burrito and it was massive; it was like a shoe horn for my intestines. I've been on the toilet since I got home and I feel great. Great atmosphere too! Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"We visited on a Monday at around 5:30.  The place was nearly empty, which was quite pleasant.

One of the things that had drawn us to the spot was the advertisement of their 27 taps.  We were not disappointed; the selection was quite nice.

We got the arancini and the torta maria. Both were quite tasty, though I'm not sure tr hat the vanilla in the tortilla worked as well as it might.  The result was a bit too sweet for a dinner entree.

For dessert we got the bread pudding.  It was a solid if unexciting example of the form. The cherries were quite nice, but the bread itself could have used a bit more flavor."}
{"text":"Radio Maria has the best Cubans in Champaign. The bad news is that you can't get it unless you go during brunch on the weekend. The tapas, however, are pretty good. I generally get the roasted garlic and one of the various meat dishes, though sometimes I add in or replace it with the cheese and jelly plate.

Radio Maria can get expensive, and often crowded, but the decor is great and service has generally been strong."}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent atmosphere. Great beer selection, nice outdoors sitting area. 
Definetely one of the best places downtown. Unlike that filthy cowboy monkey."}
{"text":"Huge wine list. Great service.  Brunch menu is fantastic.  Love the Masa boat and the Mexican Cofee!"}
{"text":"Came in with a party of 6 for a late breakfast and ordered 3 Bloody Marias and 1 Bloody Mary. All 4 were half full when we left. They tasted like tomato juice with a shot. Nothing added except a couple of olives. The server apologized but the drinks were still on the check.

The meals were good though."}
{"text":"First, for the good things. It's a really cool space with a nice vibe and atmosphere and some good people watching even on a Tues. night, and they happen to have $4 wine on Tuesday nights. The service was bad, however. Our waiter seemed new to the job and kind of clueless -- told us outright that he had no idea how one of the tapas selections was and needed to really study the wine I was ordering because he didn't seem familiar with the list at all. Also, he disappeared soon after our first dish arrived and by the time he showed up again, we had decided against getting the bread we had earlier requested or ordering an additional tapas. Had he \"checked back\" as any competent server does, we would have ordered/spent much more. Not only was the waiter MIA much of the time, but he seemed disinterested in serving us and wasn't friendly or engaging at all. The bartender also made me wait for a long time while he filled multiple orders before taking 30 seconds to give me a bit of change for my meter. In summary, the food (what we were able to order -- scallops and the small filet plate) was good, but we would have liked to have sampled more if the waiter was more attentive and competent. I am a very frequent fine diner, but hate to get bad service. Everyone wants a 20 percent tip, even if they give 8 percent service, which is about what we got. The staff, in general, gave the impression that they didn't care if we were there or not. Maybe they didn't think we were \"cool\" enough, but the service was definitely indifferent."}
{"text":"The brunch was very tasty and a good value.  The dinner, however, was nothing special.  They had a lot of great choices on the menu, but everything just sort of tasted average.  

The service was good.  I would suggest going here for brunch.  Dinner is also good, but not amazing."}
{"text":"Hostess was delightful and I look forward to having her as a waitress soon. 

Food was good but chorizo lacked flavor and heat in my special omelette. 

Bloody Mary served in a wine glass? Really?

Waitress was defensive and unprofessional to my friend who hosted me for brunch today to celebrate my birthday early. 

Not my first time here and not a best either."}
{"text":"Very comfortable and inviting atmosphere with booths, tables, hi tops, and a bar. I'm a vegetarian pilot always on the lookout for good vegetarian options. This place definitely fit the bill. I had the goat cheese appetizer and veg paella. Didn't ask how it was accomplished but the paella tasted like a true seafood paella, outstanding!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday. Was greeted at the door by the host and led into the dining room that was dimly lit by candlelight. We ordered a couple glasses of pinot noir and were happy with their selection. Our appetizer, the broiled goat cheese, was amazing. The grilled bread provided great texture to the meaty pumpkin seed and spice spread and the divine creaminess of the goat cheese. Our entrees were the two dinner specials for the evening, seared diver scallops and a filet. Our scallops were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The accompanying puree had pieces of bacon which perfectly complemented the entire dish. Our filet was a beautiful medium-rare piece of meat that just melted in my mouth. The bourbon demi glace and gratin brought the dish together into a very enjoyable experience. We tried two desserts, the molten chocolate cake and the green tea white chocolate mousse. I absolutely loved the mousse while my partner preferred the chocolate cake. The best part of the rich chocolate cake was the fresh mint ice cream that came with it. 

Overall it was an amazing dinner. Go to Radio Maria and order their dinner specials. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered off the tapas menu and had a delicious meal.  Big fan of the roasted garlic and also the eggplant.  The pictures on yelp are very true to the dishes.  The service was attentive, but I was close to assisting the waiter with opening our wine bottle.  It was painful watching him struggle.   Overall really nice outside dining experience."}
{"text":"Wow.  What a great restaurant.  I went here with my spouse for a nice date on a Saturday night.  It wasn't too packed, surprisingly.  They had outdoor and indoor seating, and the atmosphere was exceptional - really nice decorations, perfect lighting, both laid back and classy in its artistic feel.   

We decided to order drinks and tapas.  They have an excellent selection of beer and wine, by the glass and bottle, both affordable and more pricey, depending on what you want.  I had a delicious local craft beer, and my spouse enjoyed some really nice white wine.  We are both vegetarians and found that there were many delicious tapas options for us, including fried goat cheese, patatas bravas, fried artichoke hearts, and small gnocchis.  Everything tasted wonderful and the presentation was nice as well.  

Finally, the service was really good.  Our waitress, despite having several tables both indoors and outdoors, was attentive without being weirdly hovery, gave us good recommendations, and was really friendly.

Overall, an excellent experience, and a great environment for a date."}
{"text":"What a gem! This is our new fav spot when we come to town. Thanks to all for wonderful food and service!"}
{"text":"I have been to Radio Maria about two dozen times in the two years that I have lived in Chambanavoy, and the only poor experience I had there is when our server brought me a splash of Tempranillo to be passed off as the glass of wine I ordered.  This was a one time fluke, I suppose, and I keep coming back.  Their Sunday brunch is outstanding!  I always get an omelet (sometimes, the special of the day and sometimes off menu), with potatoes, and their beer battered bread accompanied by a mimosa.  They also have a Bloody Mary bar, which is incredible.  Perhaps, more important is their tapas dinner menu and their selection of beer.  Their beer and wine selection is top-notch! I always get the queso de cabra frito, eggplant frites, tuna with olive tempenade, and some salmon or scallops dish.  Radio Maria is a tried and true Champaign restaurant.  It's a must if you're in the area.  I always bring visitors and guests here!"}
{"text":"I went here twice for dinner and once just for drinks.
This is the perfect place for a date night- it has a really chill, artsy vibe once.
I went here for dinner once and it was very crowded but we were able to eat at the bar. I had a hot pot, which was delicious but my mother ordered something that didn't take as long and her food was cold. They were very nice about it though and reheated her food for her.
When I came for drinks, the server was very accompanying when our group wanted to move from inside to outside and had confusing orders.
The tapas are delicious- especially the eggplant frites and the goat cheese. You could come here a million times and never order the same item.
Next on my list is to come here for brunch because I've heard amazing things."}
{"text":"After being a loyal patron for seven years, I am done with this place. While they still have some great drink selections, the service has gotten so bad. On a Friday afternoon, I was one of six sitting at the bar. Two bartenders and 1-2 servers were working and it still took them 20 minutes to take my order. With the downtown Champaign scene evolving, this kind of situation is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Great tapas bar, great drinks, great ambiance, great service, just great overall.  You can come here anytime at all and find something that suits your palette.  

An upscale restaurant in downtown Champaign, Radio Maria has both a well developed tapas bar with a metro, modern dcor as well as your classic restaurant dining area which is decorated in such a way that gives it a more rustic feel.

My first experience here was a very pleasant one as we were promptly seated, the waitress was very attentive, and the food was done very well.  We started off with the broiled goat cheese as an appetizer which was very tasty, and then I got the grilled salmon as an entre.  Like everything else in Radio Maria, it was cooked well, plated beautifully, and served relatively promptly.

I came here again several weeks later for brunch with some friends and had a craving for some spicy sausage so I got the house-made chorizo omelet.  To sum it all up: *drooool*.  My friend's said the same thing about their orders (Greek, Italian, and Pinta's omelet, and the egg sandwich).  Everything tasted fresh and light - just like breakfast should.

Whether you're looking for a place to loosen your tie and grab a drink after work, out on a romantic date, or just hanging out with friends, Radio Maria is a sure bet for good food and a good time."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch. Shared some scones, got the \"special\" omelette with Chorizo and vegetables. Two stars for the service. 

Pros: 
-The scones rocked. 
-The house potatoes were perfect--crispy and flavorful. 
Cons: 
-It took 20 minutes for the waiter to come over, another 15 minutes for our drinks (coffee, tea, and water) to appear, and a full hour for our food to come out. I'm all for a leisurely meal, but I was staring longingly towards the kitchen entrance by the end. Then when the food came out, two of our table's entrees were wrong. SO MUCH SADNESS (and hunger).
-My omelette was far too salty."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance and good food. The tapas really vary though, some are much better than others."}
{"text":"Really good food, wonderful service and a fun atmosphere! Mexican coffee is delicious!"}
{"text":"I love this place, always have always will speaking of Will really disappointed to know he no longer works there def a huge loss he was a great server. Glad to know Doug and Steph are still there. They make great drinks and are great for business. Food is good I like the changing menu. Can't go wrong with the fried goat cheese!"}
{"text":"I like to snapshot my reviews so here is what you need to know:

Pros:
Food was yummy.
Food has a different spin on classic dishes

Mixed:
Wait staff seemed on edge.
I didn't know Sunday was brunch only menu

Bad:
Service was untimely"}
{"text":"It is a shame a restaurant like this would ruin their reputation out of greed. I have been here several times, and the food is consistently good. However, for my wife's graduation, we made reservations for 7:00pm months in advance. Our group of 8 arrives, and we are told 30 minute wait. Then, 45 minutes. Then, they are running an hour late. Then, we are 3rd on the list. Then 2nd on the list. All told, we were not seated until 8:45, an HOUR and 45 minute wait, for a party with reservations. If we had known we would be waiting this long up front, we would not have eaten here and gone elsewhere. However, this establishment called this over-booking \"standard practice\", and made us wait with no apologies. This is not how a restaurant should treat their customers, and not a restaurant that deserves future business."}
{"text":"I use to go to Radio much more often, but lately it seems to have fallen off the wagon. Ok so half off wine night is nice, but other than that I try to steer clear of RM and either go to Carmons for food or Quality to drink. The food seems uninspired and the quality of ingredients is average. I do like the decor of the bar. What happened to this place?"}
{"text":"Just an idea. After you seat someone, don't just assume they will see a server in 10min. 
Just got up and walked out on Mother's Day. Thanks Radio."}
{"text":"I am not impressed with this place.  

My friend and I walk into the bar side for tapas.  I had read the reviews on yelp before I went, but my friend really wanted to check this place out.  

My first impression:  There are at least 7 empty tables and a totally empty bar.  The hostess asks us how many, and are we here for drinks, tapas, or full meal?  I tell her tapas, and she tells us it's going to be 5-10 minutes, would we like to have a drink at the bar?  Sure, we walk past several empty tables and sit at the empty bar.  We are impressed with the blue light coming out from the bar top, when a \"bartender\" walks past and LITERALLY THROWS a drink menu onto the bar near us.  And keeps walking by.  I wasn't shocked because I had read the reviews, but I thought that was totally rude.

I asked another guy walking by for a glass of water.  He was able to ablige, and by the time we got our water, amazingly the empty table behind us was available.  We sat, checked out a menu, ordered 3 tapas, and my friend ordered a beer and I ordered a glass of wine.  It took quite awhile for just the drinks to get delivered.  I was disappointed in the amount that they called a \"glass\" was about half of a glass I've gotten at other restaurants.  And when I was looking at the wine list, I asked for a recommendation, and said I didn't like fruity reds, I preferred more on the dry side.  I took a sip of an incredibly fruity red wine.  Sigh...

When the food arrived, it was alright.  Maybe I just expect more.  It was okay food, just not as tasty as I've had elsewhere.  There were no outstanding flavors, or a bite of food that made me sit back and go \"wow.\"  Just ...average.

The waitress asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu.  Sure, why not.  We went with the dark chocolate cake.  About 20 minutes later, we finally got the cake.  What took so long?  Who knows.  Maybe they had to bake the cake after we ordered it...  Anyway, I have NEVER left a piece of chocolate cake on a plate at a restaurant before.  My friend said the cake tasted like deli meat to her.  How does one make cake taste like deli meat?  I have no idea.  It tasted out right burnt to me.  Burnt cake peeled out of a pan, with some hersey's syrup on top to cover the taste.

I ask for the check.  She came by with the check, I gave her my credit card, and away she went.  Another 15 minutes passed, and she had walked by our table about 5 times.  The next time she walked by, I asked her for the credit card receipt.  She was totally suprised, and hadn't realized she had never given it back to us.  She was sincere, it was just annoying.  

I wasn't impressed with the food, and somewhat unhappy with the service.  There was dancing (salsa or something) starting as we were leaving, but I wasn't in the mood for it.  I don't know if I would recommend this place.  Maybe once just to go...  but I think once is enough."}
{"text":"AGHHHH This place is GREAT! I'm not as big of a fan on their Sunday brunch though, but everything is great, especially their TAPAS!!!

Last time I went there, I re-orgasmed over and over again. You have to try their steak tips tapas dish. Hopefully it's still there. As the steak tips met my lips, my heart began to sing, and fairies and sparkles started falling out of the sky in a beautiful, sexy, and delicious array of love. It was so good, I wanted to regurgitate each bite, just so that I could taste the deliciousness once again. It also had smoked bacon and feta mixed in, which made me want to take off my clothes and dream of simpler times. 

PLEASSEEE, please go here, and try to stick with tapas, their regular food is good, but their tapas are ahhmazing!!! only downfall though? Pretty expensive-i think we might've blown about $100 on tapas and there were only three of us.

Anyway, 

please go here and indulge on what may be a gateway to a magical land of rainbows and smiles, and angels singing to you as wish that the chef could accompany you along the path of life."}
{"text":"Radio Maria was one of the first restaurants in the current resurgence of downtown.  When it opened around 1996, two upscale restaurants had come and gone in the Mike n' Molly's space, and other than Great Impasta, in its old location, there was nary a place to eat downtown except in bars/ short-order cafes.  RM made quite a splash, and I thought it pretty good the first several years.  Nice space, creative menu (for CU),  and some good servers.  Then things starting going south as more and more better-quality eating places opened downtown and elsewhere.  I feel they often try too hard with their entrees...too many conflicting influences and tastes.  I am all for fusion cuisine done well, but I think they lose the forest for the trees here a lot.  Now, the new tapas bar I like quite a bit.  Very reasonable, GREAT beer list, better service, and b/c of the nature of tapas, a more focused concept and execution of cuisine.  Both spaces are nice - they are adjacent to each other."}
{"text":"We really enjoy this place.  Service is great.  The Sunday bartender makes the best bloody Mary's and the food is not bad as well.  We have tried several different things on the Sunday breakfast menu and have not been disappointed.  We usually sit at the bar so we see all the servers.  All are very nice and friendly.  Things appear to move quickly and efficiently from the kitchen"}
{"text":"I had Saturday brunch here this week and was terribly disappointed.  In the past its Radio Maria has been nothing but fantastic, but all they had for the lunch menu was a set of sandwiches.  Really nothing exciting at all.  Make sure you check to see what they're serving that particular day before you go for lunch."}
{"text":"Had group of 8 and all had terrific meals.  Good mix of fixed menu, tapas and entrees represented...all were excellent.  Seems like this is a never miss option for a great time in a cool atmosphere with tasty food and drinks!"}
{"text":"Radio Maria is definitely one of the nicest dining options in downtown Champaign. I remember going almost two years ago when I first visited Champaign, and really enjoying it. I've gone again a couple times after moving here, and I was never disappointed.

The restaurant is divided into two different dining rooms: one that serves more traditional entrees, and another (the larger one, where the bar is located) that serves predominantly tapas. I don't really understand why they can't serve both types of food in both rooms seems it looks like they share the same kitchen, but that's a detail. I would recommend going for the tapas (the other room is a little more *stuffy*). 

I've now tried a bunch of dishes, and everything has been good if not very good. A few highlights among the tapas that I tried: the spicy shrimp in chile-lime sauce are delicious, as are the anchovies (if you like anchovies, that is), and the scallops. They also usually have a bunch specials, which I would recommend trying. 

Not to forget, they have an extensive wine list (including a pretty good selection of wine by the glass), and a full bar. The drinks are particularly cheap (at least compared to NYC prices that I am used to), and I'm always amazed at how low the bill is in the end: you can have a really nice meal with alcohol for $40 to $50, which is a pretty good deal considering the quality of the food. The service has also always been good.  4-1/2 stars."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with my sisters.  The atmosphere was great!  I loved the massive beer list, build your own bloody mary bar and atypical menu.  

I got an omelet with shrimp, avocado and corn salsa in it which was pretty freaking delicious!  Sampled every meal at the table which were all oustandingly good...but next time I'm definitely getting the fish tacos!

Restaurant seems to run pretty smoothly...service was decent as well."}
{"text":"Got there about noon on a Saturday and was disappointed that they had limited brunch menu since I was looking forward to the highly rated tapas.  The server was very friendly and patient while we tried to figure out what to eat.  Ordered a bunch of food and drinks.  None of it was outstanding, but the attitude was so good that I would be willing to try again at tapas time.  Good attitude triumphs mediocre food."}
{"text":"Order the coffee rubbed filet - you will not be disappointed. I have had it 3 times in the past 5 years and it continues to be outstanding. 3 of our 4 diners ordered it - all had spotless plates."}
{"text":"I think the trick to enjoying Radio Maria is not going there for dinner. The brunch is great. I like their omelets, especially the smoked trout one, I like the potato and beer bread that comes on the side. The omelets are enormous and I think the Radio Maria approach (tons and tons of ingredients) works in that context. They'll make you a Bloody Mary with horseradish which I love. 

The dinners are another story. I've probably eaten here five or six times in the last few years, and I don't get a lot out of anything on their dinner or the tapas menus. Maybe I consistently order the wrong things, but the food is either over- or undercooked or weirdly chewy or bland or greasy. I have friends who rave about the eggplant frites but they are just a greasy mess to me. The wine is usually fine but most of the cocktails are silly, like sorority-girl/moms'-night-out drinks. There was one thing they had years ago that I loved -- grilled asparagus with a fried egg and a drizzle of balsamic. It was simple and delicious. If they still had that I wouldn't dread meeting people here for dinner."}
{"text":"Best brunch in town. Get a reservation, though! They also have great wine specials and the tapas is worth the price. Radio is definitely one of my favorite regular places."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere was excellent. Wife and I went with another couple and the food was great, drinks and service were on point. Cool place in downtown"}
{"text":"I can only comment on the brunch because that is all I have had so far as I have recently moved here.   Their brunch menu is quite expansive but I went with a simple Benedict. My friend got the salmon Benedict and both were very good. Eggs cooked to perfection.  Highly recommend getting a brunch cocktail. We both had the bloody Maria I believe it was called which is a Bloody Mary with tequila! So so good. I also ordered something called the lavender soda which I liked but not as
Much as the bloody. Will def come back and maybe check out the dinner fare . They had really good music playing the whole time such as Parliment, Stevie Wonder , and The Ohio Players."}
{"text":"Radio Maria has a lovely interior and I love the idea of tapas. I was traveling with a colleague and after some research, we decided to give Radio Maria a try. 

For wine, we ordered a Pinot Gris from Oregon, but they didn't have it. So we selected a Pinot Grigio, which was good. 

For tapas, we ordered fried artichokes with lemon and feta, eggplant frites, seared tuna and the mixed paella. The artichoke hearts and the eggplant were great. The eggplant was drizzled with honey, which really enhanced the dish. The tuna tasted like it was on the verge of going bad. The seasoning was really good. 

The paella tasted lovely but was lacking the crispy bottom. It's clear they make the paella ahead. The portion was small but just the right amount."}
{"text":"When we first started going to Radio Maria's, we loved it.. After the last couple visits, especially this last one, we'd be find never going back.. We started with the salad of the day and fried goat cheese.. Both were pretty good.. Next , mussels and pork arepa.. Mussels were so gritty we cld not finish them.. The pork was horribly dry and almost inedible..Service was really bad( never told the specials, which is actually normal for this place), and they didn't seem to care that we didn't eat half are dinner cause it was so bad.. We ended up having to go to a different restaurant to finish our night..We do not recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Radio Maria is typically open at 4 on Sunday's. I made my graduation dinner for 4:00 A MONTH AGO and am just being told four days before my graduation that their kitchen won't even be opening until 5... Therefore leaving a bunch of reservations at a complete loss. For a restaurant they exhibit AWFUL hospitality given that they are typically open at a specific time each Sunday. When asked why they didn't call sooner they mentioned that they just \"didn't realize.\" This is humorous given that they double booked reservations two years ago on graduation weekend and bumped probably even more people. They clearly need to get their management/ organization in check. They have completely put a hopeful customer at a loss, given the difficulty of finding a reservation so late. Will definitely not be recommending this establishment to anyone. Learn more about what hospitality and professionalism is."}
{"text":"The shrimp and grits were the BEST!!!! Slow service but was compensated by the great food!!!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but the food is overpriced and midiocre.  I had a collection of appetizers at the bar that were not large enough portions.  We were ignored by the bartender for quite a long time as well; and the place was almost empty."}
{"text":"My meal here was phenomenal. I got the Masa Boat Surprise. My wife got the fish tacos. The masa boat was nothing short of amazing. It looks beautiful before you start eating, at which time it turns into chaos. You eat your way down to the little masa boat that is stuffed with Mexican cheeses. A really thin omelet tops the boat, and it was so loaded with veggies and chorizo that you hardly notice that the eggs are there. That is perfect omelet in my opinion. The dish also included black beans, yummy potatoes, and salsa. All for only $8. My wife's fish tacos were great too, but not as good as we've had in other locales."}
{"text":"Radio Maria makes me feel good. There, I said it. Any restaurant has its flaws, but RM is about as close as it comes to perfect in Chambana. RM is situated in the bustling Downtown, and sports an eclectic modern decor with latin touches. The Tapas Lounge is all-modern, with changing exhibitions for wall-art, and a Euro-chic cleanliness, not typically found in the mid-west. I will talk of the awesome Tapas 'experience' at a later date, but this blog is devoted to our last night in The Dining Room.
With an exceptional wine-list, dinner at RM always begins and ends well in terms of drinking options. One of the best things for me is that no matter what mood I am in financially, (from big-night-out, to my typical tuesday-night-budget) there are so many choices of great tasting vino. Although RM changes its menu about once a year, they (thankfully) keep many of their favorites available, such as the Coffee Filet, Peppercorn Tuna steak, New York Strip and appetizers Seared Avocado with Quinoa salad and Grilled Goats Cheese Medallions in pesto. All dishes have latin-fusion inspired flavors, plenty of warm chile, spicy cream, mole and guacamole sauces.
Service at RM is impeccable. Quick, but tastefully so, timing is almost always perfect, polite and sophisticated. Their knowledgeable sommelier staff are very helpful for beginners and experienced wine-drinkers alike. Dinner is not cheap for the average mid-west dining clientele, but compared to similar dining rooms in larger cities, I think Radio Maria is worth double whatever the bill is.
ALWAYS order the special, their young, fashionable chefs always deliver. Expect to spend $60-$80 on food for 3 courses for 2 people in the restaurant, or $40-$60 in the tapas lounge."}
{"text":"Some restaurants in this area have Chicago-envy.  That must be the problem with Radio Maria.  The fusion menu doesn't work because the chef has not mastered the basic cuisines that they are trying to blend.  Dishes are overly complex and are either bland or actively taste bad.  

The staff used to describe it as a Caribbean-Polish Fusion.  (Really.)  I have no idea what's going on now.  Spanish-Korean?  Soul Food Middle Eastern Style?  Masa boats. Frog legs. Ground coffee rubs. Pad Thai. Torta.   The motto seems to be:  when in doubt, add more things that don't go together, none of it done well.

This could only be mistaken for sophistication by people who have never been anywhere sophisticated.  Stay away!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I ate here for dinner on the evening of Street Fest. Very attentive wait staff with wonderful suggestions. My daughter loved her filet with sherry sauce and potatoes. I loved the ginger peach sorbet and peach martini."}
{"text":"Some of the best cocktails in town. Only downside is some bartenders make them better than others. Love the mojitos! Reasonable prices. Nice decor. Nice crowd. Nice music. I went for brunch and had a lobster omelette.. I found it had a bit too many different flavors for my taste, but I'm sure others would love it, as I'm kind of picky. The guava mimosa wasn't too good though."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday with my brother and his wife and young son.  Restaurant was very frendly and understanding of nephew wanting to walk around.  There was a little bit of a wait (about 20 minutes) which seemed reasonable to me based on how busy it was. However, after being seated, the wait for service was pretty bad.  The waiter tried to convince me to order the Bloody Mar bar service (where you make your own).  I didn't feel like messing with that and elected against it.  Probably a good thing since I overheard the table next to me complain about how bad the bar service options were.  Sadly, I had to remind the waiter 15 minutes later about my drink.  He apologized, and to his credit admitted that he had forgotten to put the order in.  Sadly, the bloody Mary was very weak and uninspiring when it arrived (tasted like straight up tomato juice with very little to it).  Eventually we were able to place our food order (I got the Migas).  Eventually that food came out.  

The food was good. The Migas were crispy because of the cooked in tortilla strips.  It was a good amount of food and very tasty.  I would definitely be willing to try Radio Maria again if I was in the area.  Hopefully the slow service was just a fluke (I got the feeling the waiter was new as he couldn't tell us anything about their waffles as he hadn't seen them yet...)."}
{"text":"My first visit to Radio Maria and I love it. Kelly, our server, was quick, patient and polite. I had the lobster omelette and my daughter had the lobster eggs Benedict. I would only suggest that they increase the lobster to other meats ratio in their omelettes. The greatest discovery was their Mexican coffee which reminded me of a blend I drank before in my home country of Guatemala. Thanks Radio Maria, we will be back."}
{"text":"Great food, not overly pricey, and thoroughly enjoyable. Their menu is unusually limited for a place of this nature, but they rotate items frequently, ensuring that Radio Maria is a place you can come to more than once a month.

The best part about Radio Maria is at night; not content with being just a cultured restaurant, it become a bar/latin dance night. For this, it gets at least one more star to land at 4."}
{"text":"Reservations apparently don't matter here...reservation was made over a month out and the staff was unable to seat us for more than an hour past the slotted time.  Restaurant goer beware! Better yet the staff was unapologetic..."}
{"text":"Champaign has changed since I went to school here many moons ago. It has changed for the much better.  I love the selection of restaurants and shops,  and especially this place.  I felt like I was back home in Chicago and not a college town.  This restaurant was just add good as the better places at home.  The dishes were original and delicious with fresh ingredients and flavor.  This will be a restaurant i will visit next time I'm here."}
{"text":"Great spot to go for brunch! We all really enjoy the food and the staff's niceness every time we go. However, this last time service was terrible. It took us over 15 minutes to get our waiter's attention, we did not get coffee offered, and we didn't even have salt and pepper in the table. 

I hope they pay more attention to this details because service makes up a great chunk of the experience."}
{"text":"I went off of most of the reviews below saying that the food was a \"can't miss,\" but I was not quite as impressed. Got the vegetarian paella and fried chickpeas. Neither were as flavorful as I would have expected. The chickpeas were dry and bland and I normally love chickpeas! Would get the paella again, not the chickpeas."}
{"text":"Why did I wait so long?

Finally made it here for dinner and I'm glad I did! The restaurant has an urban / antique feel - exposed brick, high ceiling, and colorful. There were some tables outside, a rather large bar area inside, high tops, large half moon booths, and a separate dining room. Without reservations for a busy Saturday night the wait was not bad at less than 30 minutes. 

The host and server in charge of the outside patio were enthusiastic and kind striking small talk during the wait which made me excited for my meal! Once seated our actual server seemed distracted or slammed. Between 2 of us we ordered 4 dishes (tapas) and 2 drinks and were full. Goat cheese with pumpkin seeds/spices, eggplant frites, risotto balls, potato/charizo/egg dish = all tasty. The bill came in under $40! From being indifferent prior to dining here I now wish I did sooner. Radio Maria seems to have great drink deals, happy hour, and brunch."}
{"text":"Food was creative but a bit off the mark: 4/5. Service was super slow and less than stellar: 2/5

We arrived around 11:30 on a Sunday morning and were told we would have to wait 20-30 minutes since we hadn't made a reservation. Ok, fine that seemed reasonable enough and maybe would be a testament to the quality of the restaurant, I figured. Time easily killed by a walk around downtown. The hostess said that we could leave our phone number with them, and they would call us when it was our turn to be seated. A nice touch, I thought.

We never received that phone call, but wandered back of our own accord some 15-20 minutes later, and our table was ready. We received menus promptly, and then spent the next fifteen minutes waiting for our waiter. 

When he finally showed up he did apologize for not coming by sooner, asked us if it was our first time there (yes, for myself and one other in my party), and then proceeded to describe Radio Maria's menu: the uniqueness of the Mexican inspired breakfast items, the deliciousness of the omelettes, etc. I think I would have really appreciated that primer if I had not already had the opportunity to read over the menu several times while we had been waiting for him to show up. He seemed really startled when we informed him we were actually ready to order, because clearly he was not ready to take them, citing the drinks he had to bring to another table. So cue another wait...

All in all, we saw two tables that had been seated after us order food, receive their food, finish eating, and pay in the before we had gotten ours. Which points to less of a systemic problem (because, clearly, some patrons DO get their food in a timely manner), and maybe more of an individual issue. Our waiter did seem very harried, and I would venture to say even distressed, so maybe there is an issue with the division of work. I did notice that another employee stepped to help with water refills, but during only the last quarter of our meal.


FOOD : 
We ordered: two veggie masa boats, vegetarian Eggs Benedict, Mexican coffees,and a side of beer bread.

Rated from best to worst:
Veggie masa boats (4.5/5): perfectly cooked eggs, and the masa black bean and tomato combo worked for me. What did not work: the goat cheese. I actually would have liked something a wee bit less salty and more melty, but I was in the minority at my table on this one.

Vegetarian eggs Benedict (4/5): I guess I am used to versions with meat, but I could have done with a little more salt or other sort of seasoning. The slice of tomato/avocado combination didn't do anything for me.

Beer bread (2/5): really dry and cakey

Mexican coffee (1/5): Came with a half-inch of spice grounds at the bottom, and was cloyingly sweet (The upside to this is that a refill of regular coffee, added to the grounds, makes for an actually drinkable beverage).


Overall... meh. I could overlook the service issues if the food were truly crave-worthy, but I did not find that to be the case."}
{"text":"So, I've eaten here a couple times before, but always forgot to review. The boyfriend and I decided to come here for dinner, but came about an hour before dinner service. So, we sat at their bar and had a couple cocktails each. Then, instead of moving to the dining room, we decided to just eat at the bar. We ordered the roasted goat cheese, which was on top of pumpkin purée and served with grilled French bread. This was not amazing, but I liked it. Then, there was the potatoes with Spanish chorizo and a sunny side up egg. This dish was salty. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be that salty or if someone had a heavy salting hand that night. Our favorite was the hanger steak with chimichurri sauce and fingerling potato chips. We asked for the steak medium rare and it was spot on. The chimichurri sauce was spicier than I expected, but I loved it. 

We will definitely return."}
{"text":"When we first moved here everyone kept recommending Radio Maria and I have no idea why. We went there a few times. The service was fine, the atmosphere was okay. The food was awful.  Everything contained way too much garlic. You could smell and taste the garlic in everything. I think it's an okay place to grab drinks and sit outside on a nice evening, but I wouldn't try the tapas everyone raves about."}
{"text":"Radio Maria has nice decor and an interesting menu.  We came for tapas and I got the aparagus topped with eggs and the vegetarian crostini trio.  Both were very good.  My boyfriend got the eggplant fries.  They were so-so.  A little too greasy and the sauce was too sweet for me.

My only complaint is that the service was painfully slow.  There seemed to be one server for the entire place.  We sat there forever just waiting to order our food.  Not the type of place to go to if you are in the rush, that's for sure."}
{"text":"I had the brunch and enjoyed it thoroughly. My friend took his gf here and said he blew 30 bucks each on a small portioned steak dinner and sides. Moral of the story: Come here for Brunch and not dinner."}
{"text":"Shockingly I came here without checking Yelp, but I was really happy with the meal I shared with a friend. They have two menus, one for traditional dinner and one with tapas items. Since I like trying different things, we decided to share 5 small plates.

Patatas (bravas): Great crispy potato chunks with some fancy mayonnaise (aioli)  

Charcuterie plate: Slightly untraditional plate of four types of meat. Spicy salami-ish meat, serrano ham, duck breast, and bbq crispy pork. The crispy pork was my favorite, but everything was really tasty, especially mixed with the pickled onions. 

Mussels: Really complex flavorful broth with well cooked and meaty mussels. The toast they came with was top notch, also.

Lamb meatballs: Tasty, especially with hidden gems of pine nuts. If you really like meatballs, I definitely recommend these. 

Garlic shrimp: Four plump and juicy shrimp hanging out on a large piece of toast with a mayo based sauce. I loved these.

The decor is slightly art deco, but a little more colorful and whimsical than that. 

Service was excellent, and I think overall it's a pretty good value for Champaign. 

I can't think of anything I didn't like at Radio Maria and would strongly recommend it!"}
{"text":"First off the location and the ambiance is wonderful. I love the décor and the design of the bar and restaurant. Great facility! However, that's about as good as it gets. The staff is absolutely terrible! And it starts with the hostess. She was incredible rude and unhelpful. We had an 8PM reservation that ended up being 830. When we came back to Radio Maria after having a few drinks at Blind Pig, they still didn't have our tables ready! The hostess then proceeded to huff and puff, roll her eyes and act completely unprofessional.. like we should be honored to be in this restaurant-- no that's not how it works. We are the customer and you treat us with some respect. 

Anyways, we get to our table and everything looks nice. Our server was a very nice lady.. she did a pretty good job. She was definitely slow and would skip peoples orders, but I understand, that happens. We ordered some sort of goat cheese dip as an appetizer and that was good. Then we ordered our main course which took close to an hour and a half to get. The main course was very average: I ordered the pollo ( that left much to be desired). My girlfriend ordered the greek salad and fried potatoes (the greek salad was excellent, but the fried potatoes tasted like they were dropped in a camp fire). The guy across from me had the ahi tuna and he said it was unedible- like it had been sitting for quite some time. Really, the one great review was the pork chop, which I didn't try but everyone said was excellent. 

I just didn't have that great of an experience at Radio Maria. Sometimes you just don't order the right item and you need to go back to try something else. But, I tell you what the hostess and the front door staff were so bad and so smug that I definitely won't be back! Learn some manners or your career is going nowhere."}
{"text":"Decor- great 
Nice atmosphere large bar with lots of choices
End point: really really disappointing Bloody Mary 
Choose a different drink or a different place if you're in the market for Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Been here many times in the past - have always loved it.

Today, however, I was very disappointed.

I ordered Pancakes at brunch and they were RAW on the inside and I could taste the batter.  They were wet and chewy.

So, I told the server, and sent it back, so that I could get a new pancake.

The server brought me out a fresh pancake - AGAIN, the pancake was RAW on the inside.

Is it that hard to make a simple pancake?

ADDITIONALLY - The food (we have 3 orders) took 40 MINUTES to come out!"}
{"text":"The food here tastes good, but I'd probably still find excuses to come even if it were just mediocre. The decor is lovely and interesting, and some of the food is almost too pretty to eat. This is where I take my aesthetically inclined friends and acquaintances when I aim to impress."}
{"text":"The place had a rustic vibe and is very pretty. I had an overall positive experience. The dinner food was just meh, but I've heard pleasant things about the brunch that I have yet to try."}
{"text":"Brunch might be the best in Champaign-Urbana area. 5-stars. Beer-bread toast is thick and incredible. Omelets are over-stuffed and innovative and completely satisfying. Regular specials make some variation on the menu.  Coffee is aromatic and high quality. Wait-staff at Radio rarely makes mistakes: they're natural and easy and very good.

As for other things, their beer selection is as good as any of the craft beer bars in downtown Champaign (Blind Pig, Quality, Big Grove, etc) but I often forget about it as a choice.

4-stars overall only because the tapas menu, while tasty, can get really pricy for the portion sizes. This is what tapas is about I suppose, but also means I don't choose to head here in the evening as often."}
{"text":"Overpriced. I ordered steak. Nothing to write home about. Better, cheaper choices abound."}
{"text":"If you want good cocktails that are overpriced this is your place! Seriously, they had some interesting concoctions on the menu and I tried two of them. They were both fine. Very heavy on mixer. I am one of those weirdos who actually likes to taste the alcohol, the ratio was a bit off. 

The food is decent as well. I feel as though there have been some odd thing going on with honey on their menu right now, though. Fried eggplant with balsamic vinegar and honey... what? Why? My friend loved it. I tried it. Yuck! Waaaay too sweet. Lots of dishes with honey when i was there last.

They clearly know a thing or two about food in the way they pair ingredients most of the time but sometimes it's a miss. To some degree, I appreciate that their menu changes based on what is available, however, I don't appreciate it when I look on the menu and there is only one thing I would consider eating."}
{"text":"I have tried Radio Maria on visits to CU. The kitchen is inconsistent to the point you flip a coin and gamble I guess. Lunch on one trip was nothing short of inedible. Dinner one night was nice but over priced."}
{"text":"Radio Maria is an absolute gem. They exceed expectations for both their food as well as their beer selection (which is a big deal to me). I've been here multiple times and, though it can be pricey, the food and experience is excellent. They specialize in tapas, which is I a little unsure about the first time I was here, but they made for a divine experience. It allowed us to try multiple dishes without full  off one particular dish. So good.

Now to my favorite part, the bar. It's hard to put into words the atmosphere the bar has. The bar itself is lighted, and it's a sight to behold. The walls feature an array of different art pieces, and each one is unique. Most are like nothing I've seen before. 

I can't say enough good things about this place. No matter the occasion, Radio Maria is one of those businesses in C-U that I consider a must visit. Even if you don't go in for food (which you should) at least do yourself a favor and grab a drink at the bar and take in the view. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My wife and I returned to Radio after not having been for several years. The service was fantastic and the wine list was excellent. For the most part, the food was good, but there were a couple clunkers. 

We ordered the a number of tapas, including arancini, pork belly arepa, diver scallops, crab tart, pork tacos, and beignets. The arancini were nicely done, if slightly overpowered by the breading. The pork belly arepa, however, was not made with pork belly and the diver scallops were not diver scallops. I believe the arepa was made with pork shoulder, and was good, but no one ever said anything about the change. Similarly, the scallops were very well done, but were not diver scallops. The crab tart, on the other hand, was a clunker, as were the beignets. The tart was made of corn bread and I don't know that I've ever had a more dried out piece of corn bread in my life. It totally overshadowed the crab. The beignets were huge, which meant they weren't cooked through. They were like eating a heavy cake doughnut, not the light crunchy wonder they should be. The best dish of the night was the tacos. Smoky, spicy, delicious. We will probably go back, but will be much more careful in selecting our dishes."}
{"text":"This place keeps getting better and better. I have to admit, it had been 3 years since I went back to Champaign but I am glad we were able to visit one of the restaurants I used to frequent. The tapas bar wasn't there when I used to come, but it is an excellent addition to this fusion style restaurant. My favorites were the egg plant frittes and the seared scallops. Hopefully it won't be another 3 years until I am back!"}
{"text":"We had a nice dinner here last night. We were seated quickly, and the service was great. We had such a nice waiter, a self proclaimed foodie, and each of his suggestions were great. My only complaint would be how the menu was organized. It was very difficult to read, as I have never taken Spanish nor any of my table-mates. It took us quite some time to realize this was a tapas bar! Lovely seared tuna and beef tenderloin with horseradish mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Brunch!

OK, first, we have to discuss the breakfast potatoes.  As a daughter of Irish stock, I thought I was pretty much over any potato-creation.  Wrong.  These were baked to perfection (crispy skin, soft middles) and impeccably seasoned.  I ate every last morsel.  Seriously, I love when things look so simple (they are just cut-up potatoes!) are so unreasonably delicious.

Secondly, just about any option could be made vegetarian.  Bonus points for that, Maria!

Portions were enormous... but we all cleaned our plates... so yeah, it was all very good (or we are all brunch-piggies, your pick).

Our lovely brunch was reasonably priced as well.  I treated my two friends (yeah, I'm a high roller) without cringing at the check."}
{"text":"What has happened to this place???!!! The brunch quality has decreased steadily and the overall service is terrible. On Friday night, our table was approached 3 times and asked if we wanted a waiter or if we would lime to order our drinks from the bar, we requested waiter, and waited another 20 minutes. They were pouring martinis into snifter glasses because they ran out of martini glasses??? This place has always been my steady place, hopefully they figure before they get swallowed by the new competition in downtown."}
{"text":"This place should be shut down. The incompetence of the staff here is embarrassing. Two tables next to us left even before getting their first plate served after 2 hours of waiting. When we asked about the estimate of our food, the waitress very impolitely responded \"there are other tables that have been waiting for longer than you guys have\". This restaurant is a disgrace to the beautiful and beloved campus town."}
{"text":"The food was great, a great meal with a variety of menu items. I had went this past Saturday on Mom's Weekend at UIUC. I felt that they were a little understaffed for an event like this that brings them an intense amount of traffic. They could not properly accommodate my large party which they had previously told that they would be able to sit us all near each other. Upon arriving they told us we could have two separate tables in completely different rooms or wait for a bigger party to be done and take one of their tables. We decided to wait, and when the other party was done, we tried to get a table and the staff was rude saying that we could not take it. Eventually the staff member talked to a manager and we ended up getting the table. 

Great food, service needs work."}
{"text":"We went at 1130 on a Sunday morning for brunch. Party of 5, the wait was only a few minutes although the restaurant was crowded. Our hostess was very nice and placed us in a good comfortable table with plenty of room to get in and move around. We all had either an omelette or French toast or the special. Aaron was our server and he was awesome, quick, funny, attentive and had great ideas about what to eat. I ordered the lobster omelette and it was very good, light meal with vegetables. I asked to substitute fruit for potatoes and Aaron was very accommodating. My only complaint is that the Bloody Mary was weak. Aaron and the people who served us were great, they kept our waters full. The other folks at our table enjoyed their meals. AAA establishment."}
{"text":"Nice upscale-casual place in the heart of downtown Champaign. Their menu varies, but just tonight I tried a couple of tapas (fried mozzarella and calamari) and the mushroom ravioli. All were delicious and well presented.

My warm chocolate cake dessert, however, tasted soggy and generally unpleasant. It came with a scoop of some oddly flavored ice cream---I think it was meant to be mint, but it tasted more like horseradish. Not the best way to end a dinner; fortunately the rest of the meal was good enough to make up for it.

Our server tonight did a thoroughly wonderful job. But overall service in the restaurant felt slightly slow, even on this quiet Monday night when my party was one of only two or three in the entire restaurant for a whole two hours. Halfway through our meal I noticed a middle-aged woman abruptly exit the restaurant despite pleas from her waiter. There was no commotion: it appeared the customer left, after settling down but before ordering, simply to protest the service speed.

If I had to nitpick, I'd add that the men's restroom was a little worn and unkempt in the details for a restaurant of this caliber. The lock was also broken. Holistically, though, I had a great dining experience here.

Quick tip to first-time diners: Free parking is kitty-corner to the restaurant in a third-party lot. Spaces numbered 1 through 30 are reserved for this restaurant's patrons."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place is not even worth trying *for dinner*, so just steer clear of it. My family and I have tried it multiple times (we live in the area) and it's never been good. 

For example, tonight we tried the paella, the Biahi Tuna, and the Torta Maria. The meat in the paella was tasteless, the rice was undercooked, and there were small patches of dirt or sand (possibly from the mussels?) in the rice which made it kind of gross to eat. The Biahi Tuna had sliced almonds on it that were hard as rocks, and the Torta Maria was a gloppy mess with unidentifiable ingredients. And here's the kicker - each dish was also super pricey! 

Although our server was very friendly and helpful, I still only give this place one star."}
{"text":"first drink: arcadia porter.  pretty good.  decent price.

second drink: kilt lifter. menu advertises: \"tastes like a cookie\".  ok i'm in the mood for sweet.  

when i got it and tasted it:  EWWUCK.  completely flat.  and tasted like syrup.  not the you-put-on-your-pancakes-good-kind, but the high-fructose-corn-syrup-kind.  EWWUCK.

me: can i trade this for something else?  it's really not good.
bartender 1: what do you mean?
bartender 2: what is going on here.
me: this tastes like corn syrup.
bartender 2: the menu says \"tastes like a cookie\"
me: it tastes like ROBITUSSIN. have you tried it.
bartender 2 walks away never to return
bartender 1: we can't _trade_ it. it's not like we can serve it to someone else.  it would be different if there was something wrong with it.

this beer tastes like ROBITUSSIN; how wrong do you have to get?  

your beer tastes like ROBITUSSIN = WRONG.  your cookie tastes like ROBITUSSIN = WRONG.  anything besides ROBITUSSIN tasting like ROBITUSSIN = WRONG.

if i wanted to treat my nasal congestion, cough, runny nose, stuffy nose, sneezing, itchy watery eyes, i would have gone to my local pharmacy.  but hey, at least i got a better deal at radio maria's.

it's not entirely their fault; it's my fault for being born as a _non-priviledged_, seeing that i'm not a WHITE MAN donning a business suit.  

if you want differential treatment, go here."}
{"text":"In Champaign, this is the closest thing to a Spanish or Latin American style tapas-and-wine experience. The tapas are great, though generally quite small for what you pay. Favorites: queso de cabra frito (fried goat cheese), bread and butter (comes with several flavored butters), patatas (potatoes), calamari, and eggplant frittes. The wine selection is excellent, too."}
{"text":"Delicious, loved the tapas and the paella. Very good food, a little pricey but worth it for a nice dinner out"}
{"text":"I've moved back to Champaign-Urbana after living here briefly 8 years ago and sooo much has changed. I feel like either the town finally realized that it would be wise to start spiffing its image up a bit to attract more students' $$  by spending some $$ or else maybe in the last 8 years, CU's been adopted by a millionaire benefactor with desire to see a small town emulate a big bad city in its gastric offerings. The restaurant scene here has improved phenomenally. My boyfriend and I popped into Radio Maria after being turned away from Bacaro for not having a reservation on a Saturday night. We both had to giggle a little as that's never happened to either of us before in Chicago but it's good to get rejected every now and then. The waitress was apologetic and nice enough about it. So next door to Radio it was and I'm so glad we gave it a chance. We hadn't been in the mood for tapas until we opened the menu. Surprisingly innovative, interesting and very hip. We tried the smoked red potatoes with aioli, the fire roasted pears with manchego shavings and fennel, spanish fusilli pasta salad with olives (which I didn't want to fuss with at first b/c I hate spitting out seeds in public but they were pitted, nice touch) and spanish olive oil. I'm not a big dessert person but since I'd been enjoying the meal so much, I splurged and ordered the pumpkin cheesecake with cinnamon cream sauce. Still thinking about it a day later...the restaurant's decor was again surprisingly hip for Champaign. The bar is lit in blue from beneath and the artwork was very urban/Japanese. There was this cool light box banner thing running the length of the artfully splash-painted brick walls that I'd love to have in our house back in Chicago. Check it out if you're in town. The waitstaff and service was also very friendly, young and attentive."}
{"text":"I went here for Valentine's Day and was slightly disappointed. While the soft lighting and tiled ceiling lends a lovely ambiance, the food and service did not stand up. 

It was a very busy night, but our waitress was obviously assigned to too many tables. It too a long time for her to take our order and she forgot to bring the basket of chips initially. We were also seated by the window and the heating was poor. I was lucky I was wearing a warm dress, because I saw people near us having to wear their jackets while dining. 

I enjoyed my appetizer of figs with honey and gouda and the chips had a tasty aioli dip, but the main courses were less impressive. I had the Torta Maria, which sounded fascinating, but it ended up being a heap of flavors that really didn't stand out. My date's chicken breast was teeny tiny and he did not enjoy the accompanying slaw. The dessert menu was a bit boring, but the pot de creme was good. 

I also tried the tapas bar recently, which was a slightly better experience. The salmon skewers with cucumber were perfectly spiced and delectable. The balsamic fruit with manchego on bread was good as well. However, the lamb skewers...they were like meatloaf on a stick. The tapas are a good way to try several dishes, but they are overpriced considering how little you get and that I could probably grill salmon and put it on a stick myself. The exception would have been if the little dishes displayed exceptional artistry, such as Cafe Luna's."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place to take your parents/family out for Sunday brunch, especially if your family is full of food snobs who don't believe small college towns have anything worth eating. C-U does a good job of disproving this (and at times, an amazingly disgusting job of proving it correct) but Radio Maria is my number one choice.

Their brunch menu features typical brunch/breakfast items; omelettes (lots of options for fillings), other egg creations, sandwiches, etc. My mom is a big fan of their crab cakes, and I believe my dad always gets a sandwich of some kind. I always get an omelette, which I always enjoy. Everything (nearly) comes served with their \"beer bread\" which seems to be some kind of beer/corn bread thing that's fantastic. They sell it separately in loaves, last time we were there my parents bought one to take home.

The service can be a bit iffy, last time we went our waiter seemed to have forgotten about us as people who were seated later got their food way before we did. But eventually our food came, and he was very apologetic. I don't think this is indicative of their service typically, but from what others have said it may be. 

Overall though, Radio Maria is not to be missed."}
{"text":"Radio Maria really is a bright spot in downtown Champaign. It's sort of criminal that its average rating isn't higher (particularly compared to duller visits like the unremarkable Esquire's and Applebeesian Destihl).

While there may be little in Champaign to compare to bigger-city fine dining, Radio Maria (and Bacaro, to a more intimate extent) shoot pretty satisfyingly close to the mark. Radio's selection of beer and spirits is dizzying and its bartenders have been, in my experience, charming and skilled. Their tapas menu is a little uneven, but with that topography come some nice peaks.

For sit-down dinners, there's a dining area and outside seating, both of which are quite nice. The dinner menu is small but far more evenly excellent. Their desserts are also wonderful. Other restaurants in the area with comparable pricing can't deliver meals this nice.

And finally, go to Radio Maria for brunch. You'll spend about as much as you might at, say, \"Le Peep,\" but your meal will be ten times as good. Getting there at 10:30 on a weekend morning and sitting outside off North Walnut Street is a pleasure unique to Champaign, and it's one I'll miss when I'm gone."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of tapas.  I love going with 2-3 people and ordering way too much food in order to try as much as possible.  Well this trip I accomplished just that.  I came here with 3 others and we each ordered 2-3 items off the menu.

Everything that came out was good.  There was nothing we tried that was bad, but a couple stood out above the rest.  Here are the items we got!

The Brussels Sprouts were delicious!  I highly recommend you order these if you come.

The Risotto cakes were the table favorite although they were good but not AMAZING for me.

The Cheese Plate was presented nicely and had good cheeses, but far too expensive for what you get honestly.  You can skip this.

Fried Cauliflower/Broccoli was delicious!  I highly recommend this.  Comes with an aioli that you may want to go easy on as I felt my arteries clogging a bit with every bite.

Fried Potatoes they have come as 3 different options.  We chose the one with cheese, andouille sausage, and a fried egg which were delicious, but I'm a sucker for fried egg on anything really.

Fried Goat Cheese sounded good on paper and was fine, but I could have gone without it.  This one is a pass for me on the next trip.

Paella we chose was the mixed which came with andouille sausage, shrimp, chicken and mussels.  I liked it but it did not compare to the Paella's of Miami.  Also keep in mind that this Paella is tiny and definitely more of an individual portion rather than a shareable.


All in all I was happy to try this place and would come back if someone was dying to go back."}
{"text":"Staff and kitchen are responsive to dietary requirements, but there are few gluten-free, vegetarian options and zero vegan options.

For this meal I went alt-veg to include dairy and egg (I have no idea why unborn chicken embryos are included in vegetarianism, but apparently it's a thing...)

My husband and I visited this popular spot for Sunday Brunch and tried three menu items. We came here mostly for the drink specials: bottomless mimosas ($15) and make-your-own bloody mary.
The mimosas were truly excellent. Try the guava! But bottomless mimosas need to be served quickly and that was not the case here. We spent more time waiting for mimosas than we did drinking them, although our server did his best and finally just stared bringing more without asking. I wish this deal was $12.99 (max) instead of $15.
The bloody mary bar was way too much fun! Plenty of fixings and sauces to add in. The house mix was standard and worked well with the extras.

1. Vegetarian Masa Boat Surprise: Scrambled egg with peppers, onions, mushrooms, and cheese atop a cornbread slice sitting on black beans, with corn tortillas on the side. Surprise! There was also cream cheese between the cornbread and scrambled egg mix. I was confused by the use of the cornbread as it made the dish dry and served as an additional grain/starch when paired with tortillas. But if you're going for a filling egg-based dish that's rather tasty due to its animal components (including cheese), then go for it and you won't be disappointed.

2. Falafel Salad: I've had better falafel. This falafel was dry and flavorless, plus I  think it was a bit overcooked. The pickled onions were a nice touch, and the pita bread slices were flavorful, but on the whole this dish was rather boring. The yogurt was too minty.

3. Carrot Cake Pancakes: Great carrot cake flavor and a delightful cream cheese frosting-syrup. Make sure you have a bit of the fresh strawberries with each bite - their tartness plays well with the cakes and syrup. One of the cakes was overcooked and black on the bottom, making the cake hard to cut and affecting the overall flavor.

Our brunch experience at this hipster joint  cost $60 plus tip, and yet I could have caught more of a buzz from the drink specials. I might end up here again, but I won't be chomping at the bit for another try."}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options and large beer selection! Highly recommend! Heard there was salsa dancing in the evening on Saturdays as well, but left before it started."}
{"text":"I had a great experience. The food and drinks were great. The ambience was great. The waitress was very attentive to the party. Very eclectic and interesting food and drink choices. Especially the Tapas."}
{"text":"Soooooo, I love Radio Maria. I have loved it for years. I have seriously been frequenting this place for over a decade. And while it has been clear to me for quite sometime that the quality of my experience here has been on the decline, I've been in denial... until today. Sunday brunch is tradition for me and a handful of my girlfriends. We literally do it in some form every weekend. Today we went and well... where should I start? Our waiter was completely aloof. We waited at least 10 minutes, in a moderately busy bar for a whiskey soda (don't judge us for loving whiskey. It's always 5pm on Sunday Funday). No biggie though. My steak and poached eggs were not hot when delivered to my table. No biggie though. But when one of my girlfriends ordered a salad with slide of shrimp and was brought 2 shrimp ... like what?? (Look at the picture!) In what restaurant world is this ok? $3 for 2 shrimp? They should have brought her 3 oz of shrimp (an actual serving) for whatever the cost. But 2 shrimp? Don't be petty. That's so petty, and as much as I love Radio brunch when it is done right, I think I need my space until they get it together. Mind you I'm still annoyed they gave up their late night menu but that's another post for another day..."}
{"text":"Best unique and fancy restaurant I've been to in downtown champaign. Service was excellent. Interior decor was vintage/very dark (the more difficult it is to see your food, the more expensive the restaurant lol). Their cuisine was called \"new American\" so not belonging to any type of food, but more like a fusion. Ex. They serve a variety of things from paella, duck roast, ahi tuna, etc. fancy plating. You're probably going to spend average $25+ per entree. It's tapas style so the portions are very small for what you pay for. Overall, I'd go there again to try their brunch."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I had the carrot cake pancakes. Yum. People at my table loved their eggs. Though I had a side of potatoes and they were cooked well done. Many of them were too hard to pick up with a fork. 

Negative: We ordered when there was barely anyone in the restaurant so there is no excuse that we had to wait OVER AN HOUR for our food. I was SOOO hungry by the time it came!!!!"}
{"text":"I went for brunch and got the migas dish. It was very flavorful. I really liked the table and overall interior decorations- very old-timey and vintage. I would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"As I waited over 15 minutes for the waitress to return with my initial drink order on a slow night, I hoped the tonic wasn't as flat and flavorless as the last time. It was. I ordered a Bell's HopSlam the next moment I saw the waitress, and it came only 5 minutes after I pained through the flat gin and tonic. When the tapas came 45 after my wife and I arrived, we enjoyed the mussel in miso broth special and bacon-wrapped rainbow trout with aoili. The Spanish tortilla was burnt. Luckily, the harissa helped cover up the carcinogens. Now, I wait for the waitress to return so I can ask for the bill and go to a bar with responsive service. At least it's beautiful outside."}
{"text":"Had the chance to visit this restaurant on a Sunday night.  Despite having seated most of the tables in the bar side of the restaurant, they seemed to have only one person actively waiting the tables.  It took 10-15 minutes to get our drinks...not cocktails, but diet coke and iced tea.  The waitress was friendly enough when she showed up to the table, but seemed relatively uninterested in doing so.
We ordered several items from the tapas menu (no entrees) and other tables that were seated after us received their food before we did.  I agree with the reviewer below that says that tapas should be brought out as they are prepared, not all at once.  But sure enough, 45 minutes later all our food arrives at once.
The food itself was all very good to excellent, but in hindsight it's the too cool for school attitude of the waitstaff that stands out in my mind, not the food.  That's a shame."}
{"text":"This place is a paradox. I was there over Memorial Day weekend, on Saturday night, and had none of the issues with staff \"coolness\" that others reported. We were treated well and served professionally as we stayed all evening (7-11 PM). The drinks were good, though I'd say the beer was a bit small for the otherwise fair price. The odd thing is that the food is irrationally high priced - at least for the entrees. Our group of 4 ordered 3 of the specials and 1 menu item. The specials (which are not priced on the board) were simple plates of an entree & a \"decorative\" side. I ordered the Paella from the menu. The Paella was a 6 inch skillet of rice and seafood - 3 or so pieces each of shrimp and scallops, with some hard cooked sausage slices throughout. Good, but not special. Two of the specials were a fillet with a garlic crust - 4 oz of good meat. So what's the issue? Well $30 for the fillet and $24 for the Paella is an outrage for a remodeled VFW in a College town. This pricing is just too much like Soho/Manhattan - but it is Central Illinois! So go for the drinks and the Salsa Dancing after 10:30, but skip the food - it just is not worth it."}
{"text":"If you don't know where to brunch with friends on a Sunday, go to Radio Maria. Their brunch menu is unique and has a vast array of options; so bring your vegetarian, pescatarian, or omnivorous friends.
Their freshly juiced beverages are on point, and they even have guava juice! This is the only restaurant around the Champaign area I know of that has guava juice!
I ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict and it was savory, delicious, and juicy.
Staff are super friendly and 10/10 will come back."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Radio Maria, but their Valentine's Day Dinner left a very bad taste in my mouth and it wasn't the food.  Radio Maria is my favorite restaurant in Champaign.  The food is top-notch and the atmosphere is one of a kind.  But my wife and I had their Valentine's day menu this past weekend.  The food was great, but not for the outrageous cost.  It was $50/person plus drinks for a \"tasting\" menu that wouldn't have filled up a mouse.  Normally the value/price ratio is excellent.  I always felt like the food was worth the cost, but not the valentine's day fixed menu.  The high price combined with lack luster service took the sizzle out of what could have been a hot night."}
{"text":"I can't speak for the bar and restaurant itself. We went to a wedding party where the party closed the place for the evening.

As a party venue, Radio Maria was really great. I love the old architecture and the period decorations. Yet, they have a modern touch also, so I guess you would call it eclectic. When you walk in, the bar is is front of you. It is large, and I would guess that it is very well attended. (Lots of people tried to get in but were turned away due to the party.) They had one of the largest liquor selections I've seen, and they even have infused liquors. I tried the maple-bacon burbon - good, but a little too sweet for my tastes. Their infused liquors are all made on premises. The bartender told me he did it himself - and for the party, he wore a kilt.

The dining room is large. We had a limited menu with four choices and we all pre-ordered our meals. I have to say that the salad served before the dinner was really excellent, fresh, simple and just the right amount of dressing. I can't say as much for the meal - I had smoked ribs. They were pretty tough, but did have a good taste.

They also have tables on the sidewalk which we took advantage of. Topping the night off by sitting outside, drinking bourbon, eating dessert, smoking a cigar and watching the people walk by ended the night with a flair.

If I make it back to Champaign, Radio Maria is definitely on my go-to list."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch is the best in town, in my opinion.  Portions are generous and the entrees are flavorful and hearty.  Options for vegetarians.  Evening tapas is good, but Radio Maria's brunch is what won me over -- and very reasonably priced -- about $10 including coffee."}
{"text":"I went with a friend and sat outside. It was a beautiful night and our server was very personable and helpful. 

She helped us order some things that she thought we would like based on savory and sweet and she didn't mind repeating specials and such for us.

We got three tapas and an entree and it was all great.

A bunch of people told us to try the plantains. They were our least favorite. They weren't bad... just plain.

We also got the fried goat cheese, which was served with a honey sauce and bread, and arancini, mozzarella-stuffed risotto. They were both excellent. 

We had their gnocchi special which was absolutely delicious. It was definitely worth the trip.

It is definitely a more casual place. The servers weren't around every minute, but I really didn't mind. It is pricier, but worth the money. I think that it is a great place to relax and spend some time with some great food."}
{"text":"Sunday afternoon it was empty?  Seated indoors front and center. Nice place to people watch street traffic. Ordered cocktails , mango mimosa and Bloody Maria. Expecting mimosa to be well chilled it was not although both were well balanced and very tasty. Ordered tapas salsa and tortilla chips,  Coles de bruselas -pan seared Brussels sprouts with bacon bits and malt vinegar aioli , Bistec - hangar steak with roasted potatoes ,asparagus and artichokes atop unidentified spicy white sauce. Food arrived not piping hot but acceptable. Taste was at the apex of my tasting abilities. Caramelization of the veggies was spot on.  Seasoning was all well balanced , nothing overpowering yet an assertive complimentary addition to the innate flavors of the meats and vegetables."}
{"text":"The tapas and drinks at the bar are great. I highly recommend their small plates as well. I have had their shrimp, steak and scallops before and they were excellently cooked. All the cocktails I have tried from here have been great and when I have had trouble what to drink, the bartender's recommendations were right on point (after describing to him the tastes I like in drinks). Their main dishes and their brunch was underwhelming and disappointing. I would just come here for cocktails and tapas as I mentioned before."}
{"text":"I actually came here for the first time ever last week, but it was a long time coming. I kept hearing such good things about Radio Maria from what seemed like everyone I knew, so I couldn't wait to finally try it out. I went for Saturday Brunch, and was so impressed! 

They have a make-your-own bloody mary bar, with so many toppings. You can also opt to make your Bloody Mary with tequila (which they call Bloody Maria). Friends I was with got mimosas, and they had a handful of different flavors of those as well. 

Their brunch menu items are so delicious. They have omelets, breakfast burritos, and more. Radio Maria is spanish like the name suggests, so their items were definitely not the typical American breakfast items, but that's definitely not a bad thing. It was great. 

I can't wait to go back for brunch! I also want to go for a daytime meal as well, to try out those dishes. The atmosphere of the restaurant is really unique and cool too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Stunning!
Astounding interior!
Amazing Bar!

Look at the bar - the rail is a retired escalator handrail.  Look above the bar, and you can see the shroud from a vane axial fan - a big one, from the former University of Illinois wind tunnel.  Even the host station is a re-purposed tube radio.  The center of the bar is a drink dispenser, made from a re-purposed laser.  Gad - there was so much eye-candy, I had a blast!

The tapas is simply amazing - every dish we ordered was good.  The prices were on par for what you pay in downtown Champaign, and my daughter was smart enough to get us reservations.  If you're bold enough to try a walk in, all I can say is good luck.  They are reserved to the hilt usually.

All in all, a good meal.  We have eaten here twice, and love the place."}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday brunch, and ordered 3 things.

Leroy's buttermilk skillet cornbread @ $4 - just one slice.  [Chicago downtown's Bandera Restaurant used to have a whole mini skillet for this price 5x the portion of this, the price has since gone up.]  With the word \"skillet\", we assumed it would came in a full skillet (even a small one, but nope!)  Taste-wise nothing to write home about, the bread is just so-so.  Marmalade added a nice kick to it though.

Migas & Pulled Pork Eggs benedict - both were not too bad each came with a small side of their house potatoes.  The deep fried house potatoes were delish. Portions of the main entree were enough, but the side potatoes was on the lighter side, almost too little.  

Service at 1:30 pm on a Sunday was a little slow - the place was fairly filled up, still, it seemed like they had a good number of servers, so this was a little disappointing.  

Nice ambient, but can get very noisy.  

Our overall rating of the restaurant is 2-star."}
{"text":"i'm from los angeles, the land of many-a-radio maria - so really, i like radio maria because it feels like a slice of home.  i've been three times so far, and frankly i have to say that nothing has blown me away, but everything i've had has been pretty damn solid.

first time i came for lunch, and had a portobella/goatcheese/pesto sandwich thing, and it was delicious.  not very unique but good eats.  i came for dinner the same night and enjoyed the pan seared peppercorn crusted tuna which again was not a unique dish by any means but solidly executed.  i recently went back for the tapas - their piquillos rellenos were flavorful and the portobello entree was perfect.  what i admire about the food here is that they aren't scared of flavor, which is something ive noticed happening in fusion-type restaurants.  ALSO, their drinks are marvelous. pricey but innovative!"}
{"text":"Radio Maria is normally good but I had the worst experience here and will not be going back. Our server said the kitchen lost our ticket but we still didn't get our food for an hour and a half. Then when we did it was clear they had skimped portions to get us our food faster. I had a lobster eggs Benedict with lobster on only one eggs. And my friend had a vegetarian eggs Benedict but the egg was poached. They gave us a 25% discount but not worth it"}
{"text":"Great, unique food. Awesome atmosphere. The hummus is fantastic, as is the goat cheese with honey."}
{"text":"There are so many good things to say about Radio Maria. Their style is a marriage between old world 50's and the 21st century. The tables are decorated underneath and they are unique to every table. There are about 10 tables outside if you like sitting outdoors. 

The brunch menu may seem overwhelming at first, but you can narrow it down to your dish pretty easily. They have a wide selection of omelets. They also have egg dishes with rice and beans. It includes vegetarian options. I had the guava juice, churros, and smoked pork posole. It hit the spot. Try getting a slice of beer bread! It's hearty and is flavorful. The churros are fluffy and not too sweet. I am not familiar with real churros, but this one tasted good! The service for a Sunday brunch is slow. I had to flag the waiter down to take our order after 15 minutes of sitting and waiting. 

The tapas menu is extensive. Hands down, my favorite dish to order are the lamb meatballs. They are made with pinenuts and tender lamb and then are stewed in a seasoned tomato sauce. You have to try them! I also love the Paella. There are several different kinds, but I like the mixed because you get to try all the different seafood and meats. It is big, so plan on sharing or gorging yourself in awesomeness. 

It is on the pricey side, so I would make this the place to go when you want to treat yourself."}
{"text":"Tapas Bar! Sat at the bar with a friend and the bar tender was AWESOME! He was so nice and let us try a bunch of wines until we liked one. The ambiance was great because it was dark with cool lighting. It was open late which worked because it's a quiet town. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Good food from a wide selection of ethnicities - cajun, indian, latin american, but not fusion.  Just all on the same menu.  Kind of hard to explain.  They have just about everything - seafood, duck, lamb, plus the standards.  They try to be inventive but usually are not too adventurous - still, the meal satisfies.  I think they could let their hair down a little more by putting some riskier things on the menu.  Good selection of wines and beers, plus margarias and sangria."}
{"text":"Only had a couple tapas here one time, but they were good. Brunch was awesome though. Small menu but so delicious. In summer you can sit outside and it is something I will definitely repeat."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and would probably go back now that I've picked a few items that I like. We did tapas, so here' s rundown.

Likes
Fried artichoke hearts
Arancini (favorite!)
Charcuterie


So-so
Grilled hanger steak
Salmon
Raw and roasted apple salad

It was very cold where we were sitting (not near the main door) and we kept feeling a draft. The staff was friendly but not memorable. 

Some of the items I felt were well-priced ($5-8). Yet, I felt others were very overpriced ($13 for basically four bites of salmon)."}
{"text":"I just finished dinner here about an hour ago, and I'm still wondering how Radio Maria managed to get all of this attention.  I guess their HUGE wine/beer/drink list was pretty impressive, but the food...was not.  My first disappointment was in the size of the menu.  I looked it up online and they seemed to have a wide array of choices, when I saw the actual menu, I think there were 5 entree choices, in addition to a wide variety of tapas.  On top of that, the one dish I wanted, was sold out, so I went with the Smoked Duck and Brie Pizza.  I mean, it was OK, there was a good amount of duck on the pizza but the whole time I was craving more brie!!  They could have seriously doubled the amount of brie on the pizza and it still might not have been enough, I could hardly taste it.  Also, it wasn't really a pizza at all, more like a cold flatbread, so be forewarned.  I also ordered a small side salad.  It was a delicious spinach salad, but lived up to the \"small\" definition....AND it was $6--give me a break.  If I'm looking to drink, maybe I'll stop by next time I'm in town, but I'll hit up K.O. Fusion or Jim Gould over this place ANY day!"}
{"text":"Radio Maria is trying a little too hard to be trendy, décor-wise--it's the kind of place you walk into and expect to be treated with a bit of a condescending attitude by the staff. But thankfully this was not the case! We made our way to the bar where we were greeted by a friendly barman who presented us with a very nice cocktail list while we waited for a table. I chose the Dark and Stormy, which was ridiculously delicious with fresh ginger grated into it! (I ended up having another that I really didn't need, just because it was so refreshingly awesome.) Unfortunately Radio Maria's website seems to be down currently and it was about two weeks ago that I went here on a trip out to Des Moines so my memory has faded as to the specifics of what we had, but we ordered off the tapas menu and everything was above average. I'd definitely return here on a trip to the Twin City area."}
{"text":"I grabbed brunch here this Saturday and it has been one of the most delicious ones in a long time.  I got the grilled salmon egg benedict with bottomless mimosas. The mimosas were refilled promptly and i guess blood orange is my favorite flavor.  The egg benedict was delicious but the quantity of house fries could be increased considering its price. But i must say the house fries were crispy the right amount.  The benedicts didn't fill me up so we got a plate of strawberry and cream pancakes as well. The pancakes were incredibly buttery and decadent.  10/10 would go back again especially for those benedicts or to try out them beer breads!!"}
{"text":"My lobster eggs benedict came with a portion of lobster smaller than my thumb, as did my friend's. Both of our poached eggs were extremely undercooked which was unpleasant to eat. Furthermore, the brunch entree was supposed to come with a side of potatoes. My friend got a good serving of potatoes but I genuinely only got five cubes, which was less than half of what he got. The waitress spilled water on my foot when refilling my glass, I saw another waiter spill half a cup of coffee he was taking to a customer outside and still served it to him. We asked how much bottomless mimosas cost and were told it was $7.50 but then got charged $20 for it. When I pointed this out to the waiter, he simply said \"no, it is $20\" without an apology for the misinformation. 

We were here on Sunday May 20 at 10:30am and it was not very busy, so I'm not sure why the service and food were of such poor quality. Will not return to this joke of an establishment."}
{"text":"Food was good, not excellent. Prices seem high for the quantity and quality you get. The bar and wait staff could all really use a lesson on wine - I believe I overheard 4 staff persons who could not respond on their own to questions about wine. Fun atmosphere and decor."}
{"text":"The sangria here is awful. I think it was a tequila sunrise. The food is greasy and not in a good way. The only thing good was the goat cheese. But it is goat cheese. How can you mess that up?"}
{"text":"Did they forget about an entire part of the building?  They have a restaurant that is open and functioning, and yet the food is terrible and only gets worse.  The tapas menu has changed but not for the better.
Sadly, I am pretty much O-V-E-R this place until I hear they've made some effort to serve quality food they had been for the past decade."}
{"text":"i would give this place 3.5 stars.  we had reservations here for sat night at 745 and weren't seated for about 15-20 minutes.  it was graduation wknd, so there were a ton of people.  when we were finally seated, we could only get seats at the bar, which was super loud.

the menu here is not big.  we started w/ the patatas and the bulgogi summer roll.  i thought it was weird that they had korean items on the menu, b/c there was also a korean hot pot dish that looked a bit like bibimbap.  the patatas were really good and smokey.

for my entree, i had the snapper w/ shitake mushrooms, edamame, and celery.  it was really light and asiany.  my brother's filet was huge, and my mom said her salmon was good.  my dad had the ratatouille w/ couscous, which was the smallest dish.  all the other portions were pretty hefty.  

for dessert, we got the tres leches cake, which was good, but i wished it was more drenched in milk.

service here is pretty fast considering it is packed and loud.  there were a ton of drinks on the menu and a bunch of beers on tap."}
{"text":"The food was overpriced, the service was disappointing, and the portions were small. I feel like that summarizes this restaurant adequately. Better places out there. ESPECIALLY for mexican food."}
{"text":"Had a really great time here with friends. We had about 8 people in our party. We started off with some drinks. I tried the cucumber Coolin' which was very refreshing. Got the Torta maria for the my entree and it was delicious. Its stuffed with sweet potato so just a heads up. I asked them to bring out the vanilla sauce on the side and told them to just top off my torta with their red sauce alone. I also asked them for some sour cream on the side to add on the torta. Our server Sacramento was awesome! He was super helpful and really friendly. Would def go back here again!"}
{"text":"Took my friend and mother here for moms weekend brunch - service was very quick and friendly. 

Ordered an omelette, eggs Benedict, and egg sandwich. 

Everything was fresh and delicious, large portions. 

Beer bread was excellent, as were the mango mimosas! Would absolutely go back"}
{"text":"Their paella is amazing. Lord....those big, beautiful scallops. 

Also had the on their brunch menu. The eggs Benedict with mahi mahi. The former, beautifully prepared. The fish, meh...lost its moisture somewhere, and I'm a snob when it comes to overly dried/cooked meats. But everything else on that plate, including the cornbread slice were lovely.

I really need to try their tapas and meats. I have a feeling I'm gonna bump this up to four stars when I do that!"}
{"text":"Either Sunday nights aren't staffed with the best crew or their dinner has gone downhill since I visited regularly for work trips years ago. The patatas were fine, nothing special. The grilled Caesar had no indication of being grilled as at other restaurants- not warm, no grill marks and I had a big chunk of anchovy in my bite. If you want to leave it in the salad, make it obvious as other restaurants do so a customer can choose to put it in their mouth if desired. The shrimp tapas dish was okay but the shrimp size is unusually small for a restaurant dish- like they're cutting corners to save money.   The fundido was also fine but looks like something a college kid would mix up and microwave in their dorm with 2 cans. It was served with round chips that are probably the generic brand of a grocery store, nothing you'd expect at a restaurant. For our sangria, the bartender filled our glasses nearly full of orange juice from a bottle (maybe Tropicana) and then sprayed something from the gun into it to make it murky/cloudy. It didn't seem to have wine in it and was horrible, so we sent it back and the server said the manager took $5 off our check which didn't cover one sangria. I woke up in the middle of the night and tossed my cookies."}
{"text":"Excellent choice. Great and tasty tapas menu with a wide beer selection. Good service that isn't in your face.

Highly recommend the pita chips and hummus. The chips were thick, crispy on the outside, but preserving the soft tender pita texture on the inside, complimenting the exceptionally smooth hummus."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with a party of 3. I had made reservations but they happened to be unnecessary, since we went at a very quiet time. (But for brunch? Make them!) 

We had the friendliest and most cheerful server I've ever met, and he was extremely accommodating. 

I ordered the jalapeño cheese dip with chips and the pork shoulder tacos for my tapas. My husband got the beets, garlic shrimp, and crimini mushrooms. My mother-in-law got a vegetarian torta dish that sorta looked like a Spanish version of lasagna. 

Everything was phenomenal. (I also tried a seasonal cocktail of raspberry lemonade that was perfectly tart and sweet.)

The server informed us they smoke all of their own meat, and you can tell. Everything tasted fresh and was presented nicely. 

Even the coffee was flavorful and rich. Many times, restaurants will wimp out with weak coffee. As a coffee snob, I was pleased even getting a cup of decaf with the flourless chocolate cake was worth it. 

Fabulous local gem!"}
{"text":"A great salsa dancing club in the evening hours!  I've never been here for lunch, but the atmosphere is great in the evening.  $5 to get in and then salsa dancing all night!  There's a full bar if you get thirsty and two dance floors. 

Salsa music is played and danced to--a welcome alternative to college kids bumping and grinding while sloshing cheap beer over the rims of cans.  Even if you don't know how to salsa come on by; you might meet someone who will teach you!

I will certainly try out lunch here at some point.  In the meantime, check it out on a Friday or a Saturday night!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place, always have.  One of the few restaurants that is consistently different.  Having lived in and round C-U for waaay too long its easy to see that many places are often derivative, dull, and lack character (a good example is the bar across from RM).  I make a point of going any time i pass through town and find myself craving Radio food when I'm away for too long."}
{"text":"If you are looking for frisbee-sized plates full of food, look somewhere else. However, if you are looking a quality experience with an amazing staff, then Radio Maria's should be at the top of your list. Great and unique food sets them apart from the crowd. Their tapas are creative and delicious. You won't be disappointed unless you you expect or demand a ton of food. Radio is all about the flavor and passion. To me, that's much more important."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and would definitely recommend it.  My boyfriend and i tried the masa boat surprise, smoked pork pozole, and 2 mexican coffees.  The mexican coffee was delicious, like a spiced coffee with nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove.  My boyfriend said it had a little too much spice for him, but it reminded me of a spiced latte.  

The masa boat surprise was tasty, although I recommend getting a little bit of everything in each bite.  Eating just the egg and chorizo can be a little bland, but eating it with the veggies, cheese, salsa, black beans and some of the corn \"boat\" is sooo good.  

The smoked pork pozole was really good, although it could have been a dinner item if not for the poached eggs.  It was kind of like a mexican stew with a couple poached eggs, and some beer bread.  The beer bread was very tasty.  

We'll definitely be going back and try some other things.  Radio Maria's has a pretty extensive breakfast and lunch menu."}
{"text":"Radio Maria has been a downtown fixture for many years. I've had some tasty entrees years ago in their dining room. But their current iteration isn't quite as memorable.

There are plenty of drinks to suit many tastes. I had a mint julep (under a different fancified name) that tasted pretty standard. The late night menu is ok; nothing to rave about. We tried just about all the small plates available: tacos, pozole, and nachos. I'd rather go to a taqueria for the real deal.

Brunch is better than late night. The Bloody Mary bar is ok - just garnishes for your drink but none of the typical edible accouterments. 

The place looks lovely with its trendy, eclectic decor but the aesthetics may be deceiving. I want to like Radio Maria but my experiences here with the food and drinks have been underwhelming."}
{"text":"I'm saddened by the menu change. My friends and I raved about Radio Maria because of the tapas! My favorite was this garlic-lemon buttery shrimp. But this time around the menu was awful ): The food was truly disappointing. We couldn't even finish it. We asked the waiter where all the good food from the menu went and he said they changed the menu back in July. How unfortunate! Pretty much never going back."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants that makes me wish I lived in Champaign/Urbana again. Even though it's been open for years, I didn't go until recently. We went for a brunch, and the food was amazing!

My wife had the french toast and something eggy. Probably an omelet. The french toast was fabulous. I don't know what kind of bread they use, but it's perfect. She was able to taste some of the egg used, but I just tasted lovely golden syrup and cinnamon.

The cuban was served on a fresh baguette. The meat was terrific, and so was the bread. The american fries ( I think) that we each got with the meal were perfectly cooked and seasoned.

The decor is very cool, nice artwork hangs on the walls, and because it's downtown, it's close to Cowboy Monkey, The Art Theatre, and The Virginia theatre. VERY highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The Good:
-I liked the decor.  It was very pretty.
-The \"Soup of the Day\" was Red Pepper-Goat Cheese.  I could eat that every single day forever and be very happy.
-Extensive beer, wine, and cocktail list.
-The boy said that his Curried Shrimp was light and pretty good.

The Bad:
-The waiter was not friendly.  He wasn't mean or bad at his job, but there was no smile.  Ever.
-The place is separated into two parts, the bar/tapas area and the 'dinner' area.  The two sides allegedly do not communicate (?).  You can't get anything from the Tapas menu in the dinner side and vice-versa.  Our suspicions were confirmed when we heard a waiter telling a customer that no, he couldn't have the \"Tapa of the Day,\" because he didn't even know what it was.  ....What the f?  Why?!
-I had the Korean Hot Pot.  I was warned that it was spicy, which it wasn't.  It was extremely sweet.  So much so, that I had to stop eating by the time I reached the bottom layer of rice.  It was like a half cup of brown sugar had been lacquered all over the rice.  Blech!

The Ugly:
-I got food poisoning.  Thank you, Korean Hot Pot.  My guts are still kvetching about you.

...The problem is, they had so much delicious-looking stuff on the menu, that, food poisoning aside, I'll still probably go back.  If I come out unscathed next time, we'll see about upping the score.  Really, a 2 1/2 would've been perfect."}
{"text":"Here's the thing with Radio Maria - the food is pretty good, as is the wine selection, but the service is consistently off-putting. If you can achieve to find the hostess, she will most likely treat you like an obnoxious pest at best. Service at the table is hit or miss - I've had a couple of decent servers over the two years I've lived in Champaign, but many more ill-mannered ones who seem to regard diners as a nuisance. All in all - this could be an amazing place to spend an evening, but there are many days when the dismal service is reason enough to cut and run."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of Radio Maria. It's always a safe bet for a great meal. I always have tapas but they have a full dinner menu as well. I recommend the hanger steak, plantains, and pork tacos. They also have charcuterie and cheese plate type tapas dishes that work very well as starters. The wine and beer selections are also substantially larger than the average restaurant. Anyone visiting Champaign or locals that have never been to Radio Maria should definitely give it a shot."}
{"text":"College town dining has changed since I went to school! Radio Maria is a hip breakfast joint in the morning and creative bar and grill at night. Great wines, appetizers with unique ingredients, and gourmet meat selections. We were pleasantly surprised the last time we were in town for a game."}
{"text":"I don't even know what I'm supposed to review here.  Is it a restaurant?  A tapas bar?  And what's with this sunday comfort food menu?  Do they even know anymore?

I almost feel bad giving this jack of all trades only three stars.  It's not that there's anything outright bad here:  the dining rooms are nicely decorated, the service is okay, the food is well-prepared, the wine and beer selection is thorough but not amazing.  You probably won't be disappointed.

But then there's nothing about this place that's outright great, either.

Radio Maria was the first restaurant downtown, and they did a fabulous job.  But now the dinner menu hasn't changed in years, they got rid of a lot of their good lunch menu (in favor of tapas), and they've got this strange \"upscale comfort food\" menu on Sundays that doesn't seem to fit in very well.

Even the service - which used to be their highest point - has been slipping.  As the old guard moves on, they're being replaced with awkward servers who don't know (and don't seem to care) about the food and drinks they're serving.

I will, inevitably, go back.  But since I can go just a few doors down, spend a few more dollars and get an exceptional meal, why wouldn't I?"}
{"text":"I used to love this place. The food is a bit pricey for the amount you get, but it was always delicious. I believe that they must have changed chefs sometime in the past year because there was a marked difference in the food not too long ago and it was a disappointment. The portions got smaller and far more careless in the preparation and presentation."}
{"text":"Came here for tapas with my mom and brother on a Sunday night. We ordered 7 tapas to split between us. The service was slow and a bit... ditsy... 

A couple items we ordered didn't exactly match the description on the menu... For example: the Eggplant Frites had no balsamic vinegar... 

Our artisanal cheeses were served with tiny hard pieces of pita bread, weird.

When we received the \"warm bread it with butter\" tapa, we got the some boring and COLD pita bread that was served with the cheese. Beyond that, they gave us about 15x the amount of butter that could fit on the pita they served us. The waitress who served the tapas explained the types of butter, but after trying them we realized she didn't actually know what she was serving because she clearly described the wrong flavors. 

Back to the cold pita that was served... When the waitress finally returned, I asked if she could have the pita warmed, after all, the tapa is called \"warm\" bread and butter, right? When she brought the pita back, it had been deep fried.. WHAT? When we talked to the waitress about our disappointment she seemed flustered and then admit to us that she agreed it was weird to serve pita with the cheese but they were out of the crackers (we weren't even referring to the how weird it was to get pita with the cheese plate at this point) and then she continued to ask us if we wanted her to serve the bread that was supposed to come with the bread and butter... She then brought us out some cold, but real bread. Still not sure why this wasn't served in the first place...

In summary:
Service: Terrible 
Food: Pretty good, despite the fee makes that chef made 
Atmosphere: Very nice! You can choose to sit in a casual area or a dining room
Prices: Pretty expensive for the amount of food you're getting"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome in downtown Champaign.  I had the torta maria out of sheer curiosity for what sweet potatoes, goat cheese, tortillas, and vanilla bean sauce tasted like all together.  Goodness me!  That's some good stuff to put on your fork!"}
{"text":"We usually sit at the bar and order up tapas and drinks.  The bartender never missed a  chance to mix us up a mean cocktail of his own creation.  The food is good and priced right.  The atmosphere is also wonderful, and very unique.  They also serve brunch, which is great!"}
{"text":"Love the decor and the ambiance of this place, people  working there are great, really fun  business casual look and really polite service. Lounge part of the restaurant is relaxed and fun.
Food is great, loved the variety of tapas and the uniqueness of regular menu, between two we ate like 6 tapas and shared a coffee steak total like $70."}
{"text":"Came here one evening for tapas with friends. I was the only one that ordered for the four of us and our waiter just starred at us for awhile asking if we were sure that's all we wanted. You could tell he hadn't been working there long as he had to ask the kitchen twice about what was in some of the different sauces and I had to repeat my order twice so that he could remember it. 

I ordered the Wild Mushroom Crostini, Smoked Pork Tacos and Sauteed Calamari. My favorite was the Wild Mushroom Crostini. The mixture of the cheese, fried egg and mushrooms with the crunch of the bread made it delicious. The Sauteed Calamari was an interesting dish with a lot of flavor. It came out in a soup dish so it was great to dip just some of the bread in the sauce. The Pork Tacos were my least favorite as there was too much green onion for my liking.

The food was good but each dish was made for two people rather than four. As we were finishing our plates, a waitress cleaned our table without asking if we were done, which peeved me because I wasn't done with the calamari."}
{"text":"David S. and I were here for  brunch today, and it was pretty sweet! They had a variety of options, and a full bar and a commendable wine list. We started with bloody marys though I was tempted to try the bloody maria. My goat cheese, trout and avocado omelet was fresh and delicious and David seemed happy with his tuna, so we made one happy brunching family! Though, can I just say, his tuna was his hunk of meat that looked like a rarely done steak, it was massive. Our waitress was very nice and checked in on us very frequently. All in all, a great brunch experience, I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch a couple times and dinner once and had overall positive experiences. 

First time, my girlfriend ordered mango juice and Cinnabon pancakes. The mango juice was simply awesome, very fresh. The pancakes were equally tasty, warm, soft, and just the right amount of cream. 

I ordered the masa boat surprise, which was basically a large assortment of scrambled eggs, chorizo, beans, and vegetables with a cornmeal \"boat.\" This boat was an absolutely mouthwatering crispy, cheesy biscuit and to me was the highlight of the dish. It came with tortillas too so you can make a couple breakfast tacos within the meal. 

We both split a side of house potatoes and unfortunately they were noticeably over salted, essentially impossible to eat. We told the waiter and he assured us they would cook a fresh batch. Unfortunately the new batch had 0 salt on it, so this was either a misunderstanding, misguided nice gesture, or intentionally unsympathetic. Either way, we salted it ourselves and added hot sauce in order to be able to eat it. They were quite crispy and fresh otherwise. 

Our waiter was very attentive and great. I had my coffee refilled throughout the entire meal, which was much appreciated. 

The second time, I ordered the Lloyd's omelet, which had smoked trout, cream cheese, and avocado. It was awesome and very filling. My girlfriend had a fruit bowl, which was alright but the waiter snatched it before she was done eating without asking. So that was weird. 

Overall, I had a positive time both visits and would recommend going for brunch if you haven't already. There aren't many other places with CU that do legitimate brunches with so many options like Radio Maria.

As for dinner, I ordered the paella and it was delicious, but way too pricy in my opinion. The service was fine and I really enjoyed the bottomless $15 mimosa deal, which offered orange, strawberry, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, guava, peach, and pear."}
{"text":"Food was decent - the Radio Maria torta was the best thing we tried. The tacos didn't hold a candle to L.A. or Portland taco trucks (the arepa was good but not the best I've had). We also had the tapas special which was steak with bacon-wrapped avocado - the steak was quite good, and the idea of the avocado was interesting. Desserts here were quite tasty.
The drinks were okay - enough alcohol to know there was some in the drink, but they were mixed towards the bitter side rather than sweet.
The service was incredibly slow. It took at least an hour to get our food. Biggest complaint of the night, and makes me not inclined to return."}
{"text":"What can I say? Having studied abroad in southern Spain for a semester in college, Radio Maria's Spanish flare and tapas menu really pluck at a heartstring with me. I love enjoying late afternoon tapas on a warm summer day with great drinks and better friends. 

I'm not forgetting the great selection of entrees this restaurant/bar offers, but in typical Spanish fashion, I usually fill up on beer and tapas before I can even contemplate dinner. While they don't serve dinner all night long, they do continue serving their most popular tapas until close. 

So grab a group of friends and head over to Radio Maria soon; the availability of food at all hours makes it a great place to start or end a night downtown!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the atmosphere and the selection on the menu, as it offers food you cant really find anywhere else in the C-U.  I thought the menu items were decently priced, maybe a bit overpriced for the quantity and quality of the food.  

I ordered three tapas dishes - the grilled plantains, the goat cheese, and the beef tacos.  The goat cheese was fried and served with honey and bread and it was absolutely delicious!  The plantains were pretty plain, but still a nice change of pace from what I normally eat day to day.  The beef tacos were tasty, but they were incredibly hard to eat when served in dry corn shelled tortillas.  They cracked and fell apart so it was a bit frustrating to end up having to eat a taco with a fork.  

Our service was absolutely terrible, I had to flag down the host at one point to get my water glass refilled, and she brought out all of our food at different times which was a bit strange.  

Overall, I was happy with the food I ordered and how it was prepared and how it tasted - were talking about Champaign, Illinois, not Chicago or New York - and unhappy with the service.  I wouldn't tell someone not to go there, because it is a unique restaurant for this area, but I would be warned that the service will likely be disappointing."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently ate at Radio Maria for dinner.  We'd had Sunday brunch and loved it at that time.  In all fairness, it started out wrong.  The employee seating us went to get us a table and was sidetracked by another employee at the entrance to the dining room and let us wait for at least 7 min. while he carried on an obvious flirtation/personal conversation with the other employee.  He finally looked away and saw us standing at the front door and that reminded him that we were still waiting.  I'm a relatively patient person but I was considering walking out at eating next door at Bacaro at that point - not because the wait was so long, but because we were so easily forgotten from the get go.  It was rude.The best I can say is that the dinner service left a lot to be desired (our waitress was tired and stressed) and the accoustics of the restaurant are such that larger tables are extremely loud, making it difficult to carry on a conversation in a normal voice.  The food was marginal at best although you have to give them points for creativity.  Wasn't a pleasant experience and my husband became very ill later that evening and lost his meal.  I wouldn't recommend it for dinnertime but may try again for brunch."}
{"text":"This place rocks!

The local art and industrial found object decor is so unique and interesting.

The food is fantastic. If tapas isn't your thing, check them out for brunch. The posole is to die for! Their poached eggs are perfect. Don't eden get me started on the griddles beer bread. If you do join for dinner, the extensive beer and wine lists will ensure your entree is never left unpaired. 

Service has been great for me.


Seriously though, this place was probably so groundbreaking when they opened 20 years ago. Whenever I sit in the bar area, I feel like I'm entering some exclusive club."}
{"text":"Simply put, this is one of the best \"date places\" in Champaign.  The food is amazing and priced very well.  The bar is a blast and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Lots of great tapas selections.  Go with a group and share the many things on the menu.  The regular dinners are good too but the tapas is definitely where it's at."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner and heard that the tapas plates weren't worth the money so we went with full sized entrees. Every dish was delicious and the flavors are surprisingly good for being in a small town. They have an array of holiday drinks that weren't bad. Pricey for being on a college student budget but delicious nonetheless"}
{"text":"The atmosphere and food are both 5 stars.  Our party of three was seated by the windows which was nice.  We shared a few bottles of wine recommend by our server, Jean Luc.  We enjoyed the scallops, hangar steak, and pork chops.  Everything was cooked perfectly. It was a lovely evening of wine, food and conversation.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Typically love this place but today they were very rude and forced us to sit at the bar while there are 8 empty tables around us. They claimed it was because of reservations but as we left, those same tables were still empty. Bartender was rude and short with all answers and told us we had to wait to put in orders and just because we sat at the bar doesn't mean we don't have to wait before other guests. And he kept yelling at the new bartender who was very sweet to us."}
{"text":"Food was entirely edible, and arrived promptly. That's the end of my praise. 

Not once did a member of the staff smile at us. In fact, when we walked through the door, two hosts (or perhaps a host and a server) bickered quietly about who had to seat us.

I started out by ordering a French 75 from their special drinks menu, which didn't arrive until after we ordered food. The drink was absolutely horrible, and tasted like it was half bottled lemon juice. When I complained and started to ask for maybe a gin and tonic to replace it (which should be a cheaper drink if anything), our waiter whisked it away and said \"I'll fix it.\" No apology, or opportunity to tell him what I wanted. The second drink included real lemon juice and the green heel of a lemon, but this time I could taste the stale wine they were trying to cover up. I later learned they don't measure any of their drinks.

The food was fine. The menu was a mix of everything Spanish and Latin American, which was surprising considering they call it all tapas, but we gave it a shot. Our salad was wilted, and the dressing tasted bottled, so it was not worth the money at all. We ordered potatoes with tomato, and it came out with sweet, clearly jarred, pasta sauce and finely grated cheese. (Does the Midwest want everything to be pizza?) We also had plantains, which were the highlight but still nothing to write home about, and a shrimp dish that was very bland aside from a lot of salt.

After dinner, we went to V. Picasso for wine and dessert, and had an incredible experience for admittedly close to the same price. We only spent $45 at Radio Maria, but it was much more than the restaurant deserved. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time with my girlfriend due to friend recommendation. And I have to say, it does live up to the hype. 

Since it was early in the morning on a weekend, we liked to start out our meal with some nice coffee. Not gonna lie, if you are looking to some authentic Mexican coffee, save it. Their coffee was not their highlight. 

They offered two specials that day: an omelette and a stuffed chili pepper. We listened to our friendly waiter's recommendation and ordered one of each. 

Their baked potatoes that accompanied the core of the meals were phenomenal! The temperature was perfectly controlled and all the pieces of the potatoes were cooked evenly, and just right. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, with just the right amount of salt to make it appeal to the tongues. 

It is very hard for me to describe the main courses in details, since there was a lot going on, but just know that food is served in a timely fashion, and the impact of the flavors truly made the visit an overall enjoyable experience. Definitely keep a lookout on the specials if you want something more memorable. 

 The restaurant itself is very clean, and was decorated with interesting Hispanic things that created an unique atmosphere that made it ideal for 1 on 1 dining. Definitely would return to this place next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant 0 stars.  
I don't want anyone else wasting their money at this establishment. Here goes:

My fellow students and I had organized a fundraiser to be held at R.M. We were raffling off some of our artwork and had ordered a substantial amount of food because we were expecting 50+ guests. Around 8:30pm, there was an AWFUL stench that filled the bar area, followed by a watery mist that began to fall from the ceiling along the west wall of tables. There were a number of people sitting in this area (myself included), who were covered in this putrid water (I had to go home and shower!!!). The food we ordered which was on a nearby table, was also covered. I alerted the manager who said to me \"It must be our pipes again.\" Again? This has happened to other customers? The manager then called the fire department in to inspect the pipes running along the ceiling, while our guests (those who were left) crowded awkwardly around the bar.  

The manager took no action in remedying the situation. Our food was NOT replaced, and the water on the tables and chairs was NOT wiped up, so that the guests could resume sitting. The artwork that was hanging on the wall was also damaged by the water, and was NOT compensated for. Radio Maria had quoted us for the cost of food prior to the event, but when we received our bill, it was over twice what they had quoted. Worse yet, the manager only refunded us the cost of one cheese plate. Thanks. You're swell.  This matter is still not resolved as the owners of Radio Maria seem to think they owe us nothing. I disagree, and until we receive just compensation, I will not be returning and hope you don't either."}
{"text":"Two words. Grilled plaintains. HO MY GOD.

No, but really, the couple times I've been here have been good. Normally, I've only come for drinks but today was the second time I've come for food. 

The tapas are a little on the expensive side (they are tapas after all I guess) but I think they're very tasty. In a perfect world, I'd like to have maybe 4 arancini for 5 bucks, but it is what it is. Unless you're ballin' out of control, you're not going to eat here everyday. Living on grad assistant paychecks, it's a nice treat to come here.

I really can't speak to any of the problems that folks have had with service, etc. My group today came in and the servers set up a nice big table for us. They also brought out some carafes for water which is something restaurants tend not to do.

Anyway, 4 stars. Take your date here. He/she will thank you."}
{"text":"What a unique, wonderful place!  This place has 2 sides, each with their own menu: a tapas side and a restaurant side, I ate in the tapas side.  Must have = eggplant frites.  Their drink menu was extensive, but pricey.  The service was a little slow, but granted, it was a Saturday night.  The server was personable and ready to provide recommendations though.  The place itself is beautiful and modern, and they decorate with art from local artists.  I'd definitely go back when I visit Champaign."}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing food, I would recommend the pesto omelette!! If you go there at night you've got to try a beer that you have never had. Love the selection and proves are reasonable."}
{"text":"We came here and had the sautéed mushrooms, stewed oxtail, lamb meatballs, steamed mussels, sautéed calamari, patatas, roasted tomato and shrimp crostini, and crispy bone marrow. The mushrooms were bland -- the broth needs to be more flavorful. The bone marrow was also disappointing, the sauces on the plate did not complement the bone marrow at all. The crostini was very average, too much bread and oversized tomatoes for the amount of shrimp rendered.

On the other hand, the stewed oxtail was absolutely delicious -- the meat was tender and the broth full of umami flavor. I was also a big fan of the lamb meatballs, perfectly done with a creative sauce to match. The potatoes were well seasoned and the dressing paired nicely. The mussels were served in generous proportion.

Overall, 50/50 good bad. This was my second visit and I definitely trust Radio Maria for a night out dining."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time last Friday night with a friend. The atmosphere was pretty relaxed and mellow. I ordered a pollo plato, and I thought it was tasty, especially in how the sauces complemented the noodles and the chicken. However it did cost $24 before taxes and tips. I also tried the featured cocktail, the raspberry-lime rickey. I thought it was a miss; it was too watery.

Radio Maria is a great restaurant for a chill dinner or a romantic date. They also have a bar section that I have yet to explore. I've heard good things about their paellas and tapas, and I think I'll come back in sometime soon to try them out."}
{"text":"This place was wonderful!! There were only two of us at 4:30 on a Monday afternoon.  We got seated promptly in the dining room.  The host stated it was the best place to sit if we were wanting to talk.

Our waiter was amazing and very knowledgeable.  He was able to answer all of our wine and food questions.  
We started with some glasses of wine.  I had the Riesling and it did not disappoint.  My aunt had the Malbec and said it was great.  I finished the evening with Quinta de Aveleda Vinho Verde and I regret not getting this first.  This wine may be a new favorite.

We decided to order a few different plates.  I ordered the humus and atun.  Both were amazing!!  The humus was very smooth and rich and the pita that it comes with was out of this world.  I don't think a description of the atun would do it justice.  It was just wonderful.  Very flavorful and the pickled cucumbers and spicy guacamole it was served with was a great pairing. 
My aunt ordered the hongos and camaron.  I do not like mushrooms but I thought I would try the hongos.  I loved them.  I don't know what they did to them, but the sauce they are served with really compliments it well. The camaron had a nice little kick to it, not spicy just a nice kick. 

Overall I had a wonderful experience for my first time here.  I would highly recommend trying this place out.  I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant in downtown Champaign.  Has a really nice atmosphere.  Good selection of wines.  I really wanted to like this place but in the end, their food is just forgettable.  I had the lamb once and that was a bit rough, not tender.  Also tried the salmon (or some other fish) once, also a bit overcooked.  Dessert menu was very standard."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Chambana my family stopped here to celebrate my sister's graduation from UIUC and were quite pleased.  To start, the wine list was decent with selections from the west coast to Burgundy and Bordeaux, though they were slightly more marked up that I've been used to in Chicago.  However, the kitchen was very clearly overextended on the graduation Saturday.  While I don't fault them for that I must comment that it didn't seem like they had tried to shove extra tables into the restaurant so it shouldn't have taken 3 hours for dinner, especially since we ordered quite quickly after we were seated.

As for the food, we started with the arancini and garlic shrimp skewers.  The arancini was satisfying though plain, and the shrimp skewers were well done.  The entrees were bold options that suffered only slightly from less than perfect execution and definitely warrant a return trip.  I enjoyed the pan roasted duck with goat cheese polenta and roasted beets, while my family selected their daily special (a salmon dish) or the hangar steak topped with bacon and a fried egg.  

As I mentioned, the entrees were good enough to warrant a return trip.  Hopefully on my next trip to Chambana the kitchen will be less burdened and I'll be able to enjoy my meal at a slightly less leisurely pace."}
{"text":"did lunch in their new tapas bar today.  had to sit at a bar table with those dreadful high chairs because there were no booths available. i'm not a big fan of being uncomfortable...ever.
our waiter was great, in fact he added to my experience.  the interior is very well done for that particular genre.
the food, eh, nothing to write home about.  had a small salad with the standard blue cheese, grapes, apples, walnuts=better than average.  then shared a few tapas with my friend.  we had the pita triangles with hummus and the tuna salad sandwich.  the portions were acurately small.  flavor was good but again, nothing special.  it was extremely cheap though...in addition to the food above we had the blackberry iced tea and 2 coffees and each spent $12 including tip."}
{"text":"Eh.  I have some issues with this place.  It has really good potential but I definitely have mood swings about it.  The main restaurant is decent.  The food isn't necessarily anything I couldn't make myself but it is good, especially for me-- a vegetarian, who has had trouble finding interesting vegetarian food at many of the places in CU.  Also, the wine selection is pretty decent.  BUT, I think the tapas side is just terrible.  We've only eaten in that part one time and I believe it was a Tuesday night, but essentially every dish we got had something wrong with it.  The biggest issue was that we were served the Spanish tortilla omelet refrigerator cold.  It is supposed to be GRILLED.  Not grilled then put in the fridge over the weekend!  We told our server and she told us that was how it was supposed to be.  Alrighty then!  Actually, every tapas we ordered was COLD, but this was the one that stood out the most (who wants cold eggs?  Not me!!).

Maybe I need to experience the brunch to give a fair assessment, but for now I'm giving 2 stars (4 for the restaurant + 1 for tapas)/2 = 2 when rounding down)."}
{"text":"Every time the convo about restaurants in Champaign starts, the mom-in-law mentions Radio Maria. Her praise hits often and reaches far. Tonight, we finally had dinner at the infamous Champaign culinary sensation.

The food offering was a mish-mash of cuisines - South American, Asian, Mediterranean, Spanish - and seemed to lack a consistent and unifying theme/thread/philosophy. These types of menus are generally red flags for me because they say: I can do a breadth of styles good, but not one style great.

We started off sharing the mezze plate. Pita was pizza dough-y, but buttery too...strange, in my opinion. Also, I found the couscous bland. Best part was the hummus, which I was wishing they served more of.

For dinner I ordered the crabcakes, which were more like crabballs. Goat cheese potato pancakes were crisp, but lacked seasoning. Radio Maria's Haitian slaw was flavorless and served merely as decoration on my plate - I hate to say it, but KFC's got better slaw! Positives about the crabballs - they weren't THAT bad and you get three in an order. If you order this, ask for extra garlic aioli (probably best to ask for it on the side). I probably would've enjoyed my balls (but, really...who doesn't?!) more if I had extra aioli.

Beau ordered the adobo pork. Generous hunk of pig, the orange-bourbon BBQ sauce starts sweet on the tongue, then finishes with a kick...flavor was decent, but I wasn't expecting or enjoying this sweet sweet meat (SHOCK, I know!). Jalapeno-cheddar cornbread was interesting in concept, but lacking in execution...I would've never known there was jalapeno unless the menu told me! Like the roughage on my plate, the honey left his chayote-cilantro salad be.

Call me crazy, but I AM willing to try their brunch and/or tapas, but lemme check-in with not-my-bio-mama first..."}
{"text":"Food is definitely a 4.  Friends and I ordered a bunch of tapa dishes to share.  The potatoes were good.  The lamb meatballs were average, a bit on the dry side.  The chorizo and potatoes with fried egg was tasty but also so bad.  I would recommend just picking one of the potato dishes.  The hanger steak was really good.  I could have eaten several orders of this alone and nothing else.  It was cooked just right and very tender.  The cheese and charcuterie plate were very good.  I would definitely recommend these 2 plates if you want something light and to share with friends.  Definitely worth it for the tapas but it adds up with each plate going between $8 to $12. The downside is the service is not up to par for how good the food is.  Service is a little slow like some other reviews have mentioned.  Would I eat here again? Definitely yes."}
{"text":"Looking for an omelet using my Yelp Mobile application I ended up at Radio Maria. I was hoping Sam's Cafe was open with a more diverse breakfast menu, but to no avail, I would head to the trendy (read: odd) Radio Maria. Not Maria's Radio, because who has a radio now a days? I don't even have an Pod so I am one to talk about technological advances.

We were seated on a Saturday afternoon during the beginning of Restaurant Week in Champaign. They were setting up all along the street for a big festival, so I figured we should get somewhere quick before all the drunks show up...haha. There is a dining room (which is where we were) and a bar/tapas area. Seems really trendy, hipster, and urbanized. You're definitely not in the suburbs of Chicago anymore!

I went with the Greek omelet that comes with house potatoes and beer bread, to which I got fruit instead of the potatoes. I also got a grilled plantain. That's a banana (almost, different genus species for all you biology nerds out there).

Total for two people was under $20. Waitress was great refilling my water, but she had too much lipstick on and didn't really seemed pleased to see me, which was disappointing because most people love to see a short, quirky, medium skinned Yelp Elite member. Not Ashley, who was our server. Oh well. Will I go back? Probably not, but this makes the grade. I used that pun because I am a teacher who teaches things to people...hahaha.

TURN DOWN THE DAMN RADIO, MARIA."}
{"text":"This is our go-to date night dinner out. I have never had a problem getting a gluten free meal here.  I'd give it a 4.5 star rating if I could!

I haven't been disappointed with a meal- we've tried the coffee crusted fillet, scallops, hanger steak, duck breast, ahi tuna and a few other specials! Always just the perfect amount and gluten free! 

One complaint is that the menu is rarely updated. The last time we went they added an acorn squash risotto to the appetizer list and it was fabulous but new items are super rare."}
{"text":"I've been here for both brunch and dinner. Dinner was mediocre at best, but I enjoy their brunch. It is likely the best brunch in Champaign-Urbana. The french toast is a huge serving and delicious. The omelettes are nice as well. To avoid a long wait on the weekends, I would recommend getting there at around 10:30 a.m."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner, and was really impressed. The evening atmosphere is really nice, I got there around 9 and there were candles on the tables. The server was super nice and attentive, my water glass was full the whole night. He answere dall our questions about sizes of dishes as well.

I got the Briar Patch cocktail which was really good, and looked pretty. Very fruity with nice quality alcohol. I got the VIeras which are seared scallops on risotto cake with whipped goat cheese and arugula. I got the portion with 2 scallops which was SO filling! The scallops were perfectly seared and not chewy at all and the whipped goat cheese is a game changer, so good. 

My friend got the paella negra, which comes in a good portion. It isn't incredibly spiced, but the squid ink is really rich. There is also a really good amount of seafood (shrimp, a nice scallop, squid) and well cooked rice. Overall really pleasant dining experience!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, creative and very well prepared food, excellent wines and beers, and great service. The space is very well done in a mix of old Champaign with some more subtle modern features. 

Ate here on a visit from Seattle and was very impressed. My steak was one of the tastiest, most tender cuts I've had anywhere (including any upscale steak house). The gnocchi was outstanding. The prawns with the bacon, amazing.

I didn't think Champaign had cool restaurants with awesome food...was I ever wrong!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Went with husband to celebrate his 40th birthday because so many local people had recommended it.

Great:
Cocktails and decor. Food, except for the nacho chips.

Bad:
Crushed nacho chips served with the queso. C'mon, not at this price point.
Sticky champagne glass in which my French 75 was served.
Everything about the service was disjointed, unorganized, unresponsive. Pacing was WAY off. We'd go between the server showing up every 30 seconds to not seeing her for 30 minutes. We always had an order in the kitchen. There were 2 or 3 tables seated, max. What was up with the kitchen that night? It was Saturday.
I kept getting the drink menu that was missing the first page.
Received excuse after excuse about the kitchen. After a while, these apologies ring empty.

It's outrageous that this restaurant sits nearly empty on a Saturday night when so many other restaurants within a half mile serving bar-n-grill garbage are bursting at the seams.

Get it together, Maria, I really wanted to like your restaurant."}
{"text":"We've always liked Radio and they do have an excellent beer selection. However, they appear to have grown tired. their menu seldom changes, has few really exciting options, and perhaps most unforgivably, they appear to be catering to the bland Midwest palate. They used to have truly interesting foods with abundant flavor. they also seem to experience an inordinate turnover in their staff. we went there last night and had some of the worst service ever. it took almost 3 hours for appetizers, entrée and desert. seldom saw our waiter. very frustrating experience. I sincerely hope they pick it back up as I can remember when it was a really good place to eat. But at least, they have that excellent beer selection...."}
{"text":"I come here for business every so often, usually on weeknights. Last weekend My wife and I decided to go for a date. We were seated promptly, and the restaurant was not full, but it was clear that there were some staffing issues and it took a long time to even get a glass of water. The waiter was doing his best - he is professional and I have had him before - but it was clear that there were insufficient staff working. 

We ordered tapas, which are deliciously prepared and large in portion size. However, when we ordered the hummus, there was too much to be possibly consumed with the pita chips that were provided. We asked for more, and got a somewhat strange response, \"well that will be another 50 cents!\"  Somehow either they need to be free (I mean, come on) or make them a couple of bucks, or raise the price on the dish. 

Anyway, after a long wait for dinner and dessert and the check we were out in nearly 3 hours. I like romantic dinners, but the babysitter bill was a bit high for the date."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in around noon on a Sunday, there was quite the wait for a table but bar seats available immediately so we took them up on that! Service was pretty slow but considering it was Easter Sunday we were understanding.

I got the Biscuits and Gravy, which took around half an hour to come out. I got my eggs scrambled and they were super bland. The gravy was good though, so that made eating them a little easier. Biscuits were a little hard and too floury. I would probably get a different dish next time if I'm ever back. My friend got the Eggs Benedict with pulled pork and agreed on it being a little bland as well. 

PS they have $15 bottomless mimosas on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Didn't actually had a proper meal here. Just ordered tacos under tapa on the menu. I didn't like the taco shells. The flavor was okay, just pretty standard. I also ordered Hibiscus Mojito. That was very good."}
{"text":"Once upon a time this place was good... but I can't say that's true any longer.  I believe that the tapas area is a good bar.. but not so much a good restaurant.  Go to Cafe Luna for better and cheaper food.  

I used to enjoy the other restaurant.  They still have good free chips and salsa (that you eat while you wait for your food).  The actual stuff on the menu is not so good.  Also.. they haven't changed the menu in the last half year.  Everything on it right now seems Spanish inspired.. and some of the things aren't so inspiring to eat.

UPDATE: I went here for drinks the other night.  I am not a big fan of their table set up even though the bar was pretty cool.  I think they must not have very good bartender's working here on the weekend.  It took like five minutes for them to figure out how to make a rum and diet Coke.  And it didn't even taste right!  It was like vanilla rum or vanilla Coke.  But to their credit, I heard they have good mojitos."}
{"text":"The food here is good but the portions are miniscule, and I don't mean the tapas, and the prices are outrageous for what they are serving. I actually left here hungry after getting a monkey bread appetizer, a tuna dinner dish, a drink and a dessert. The check arrived and I felt disheartened by the total which was 70$+ for two still very hungry people with the worst part being that I rarely complain about the smallness of food portions, the are usually too big in fact, but this was not the case here."}
{"text":"This is the WORST service I've ever experienced in my LIFE. Will be calling to speak with the manager tomorrow!

UPDATE: I was kicked out and the bar was shut down completely for asking to speak to a manager about bad customer service. There was no aggression or any violent or inappropriate language/behavior being used on our behalf. We were told by one of the managers \"I don't have time for you\" and \"talking to you is stopping me from helping the people at the other end of the bar\" (which was the problem in the first place, because they were only serving half of the bar). Since speaking to a \"manager\" did not suffice, I will be going into the establishment on Monday and asking for the owner or their contact information to make them aware of how their employees are treating PAYING customers. We were IGNORED, then DISRESPECTED, and proceeded to be kicked out. I was there trying to celebrate my college graduation, just to be treated like less then a person. They will never receive another dime from me!"}
{"text":"A grad school fav... This place has stood the test of time, which is the best indication of restaurant quality."}
{"text":"Please, Radio Maria owners, read these reviews and take corrective action! Do not rest on your laurels because that way failure lies...

I don't get to go to Radio Maria as often as I used to. It has a fond place in my heart, which is probably good for them as I'm not dinging them as much as I could in this review. RM was one of the first hip businesses that launched the downtown revival (along with The Blind Pig, v 1.0) and for that I have much love.

The last few times we've gone, we've sat outside and had tapas. Now I'm no tapas expert, but I believe you usually order a bunch of tapas and they come out one-at-a-time to your table so you can experience each dish on its own merits.  RM, however, always sends out all the tapas all at the same time. Everything becomes a mish-mash and it's overwhelming and nothing stands out.  You also immediately get abandoned by the waitstaff so you have to wait forever to order another drink or get/pay your check. 

Also, the pretty pretty people who work there don't like kids. That would be fair if we were dragging the kids inside and interrupting the restaurant. But even if your kids are well-behaved and you're sitting outside, you catch a real snotty attitude. I am happy to report, however, that they do have a real highchair. When my eldest was a baby they had a beautiful vintage deathtrap highchair. They now have one that is still aesthetically pleasing, but without all the metal.

The restaurant itself is still lovely. I just wish they'd shape up their staff so it wasn't so depressing to interact with them."}
{"text":"Great food! Very flavorful. Recommend trying the camarón (shrimp), queso fundido (cheese dip with chorizo), and arrozito frito (fried risotto cakes)! 

Tapas are small, so if you order for a group, about 2 tapas per person is a good starting point! 

Only complaint is that we waited pretty long for our food (~45 minutes)."}
{"text":"Just felt like adding the fact that I have traveld extensively through all of southern Spain and am very familiar with tapas. The food at this place does not remotely resemble anything I have had in Spain or any other good tapas restaurants in the US (New York, DC, SF, etc.). Everything lacks in flavor and freshness. Bottom line, hate it."}
{"text":"We decided to check out brunch. It had good reviews and we wanted something different. Not that impressed. The host argued with us when we said we would like to be seated inside. It was a nice day but the tables that were left outside were all in direct sunlight and we didn't bring sunglasses or a hat. We were sat and ordered an OJ( it was not good) and coffee. I ordered the regular eggs Benedict. The ham and the sauce were great,the eggs had no real flavor which is fine but they were not cooked all the way. When I cut into the egg,the white under cooked part came out with the yolk. My husband had the scramble and said it was ok but not memorable. Overall if some friends asked us to go we would go again but would never choose to come back on our own."}
{"text":"I dearly loved this place when I lived in C-U. Never had a bad meal, although sometimes it was marred with indifferent service of the \"I am a hipster working in the hippest restaurant in town! What, you want me to DO WORK?\" type. 

Brunch was awesome; a lot cheaper than dinner so my impoverished self could get a fix when mom and dad weren't paying. The beer bread, yes, and the masa boat, yes! And at the time they opened, renovating a decrepit downtown location to expose the brick walls and original tin ceilings was a new idea. They kickstarted a great trend. Downtown Champaign wouldn't be what it is today without Radio Maria. I remember going to that space to pick out wallpaper with my mom and dad back in the 80's. Radio Maria is a vast improvement."}
{"text":"I used to go [almost] every Sunday for brunch. 
Phenomenal. 
I still crave the beer bread. and the Masa boat

The interior is so artfully done. I always found myself staring at the sculptural objects on the walls. And the tables made with old doors. Very cool. 

(Sadly, I could never afford a real dinner experience here on my student budget.)"}
{"text":"I had Sunday brunch here. The atmosphere is cool. I like the decor and atmosphere. The server brought me a water right away. Took our drink order and they came out kind of promptly. My drink was fine but my friend's mimosa had barely any champagne in it. After our server took our order the staff was pretty good about refilling waters and coffee. The second round of drinks took quite some time to come out. 

After about 20 minutes we were told our ticket never made it to the kitchen and they were working on it. During this time I saw another table approach a server and say \"is our food coming? We have been waiting for 45 minutes. If not we have to leave.\" The server assured him it was on the way. 

At this point it had been 20 more minutes and my water had stopped being refilled. I went to ask for a manger and the hostess told me she could handle it. I explained how long our food was taking and maybe we could have a round of drinks or dessert on the house. She assured me we would be taken care of and that they were \"really busy.\" It was an average busy day. 

10 minutes later our food came out with the exception of my plate. Which arrived 10 minutes later. At this time I saw the gentleman from the other table approach his server again and say \"we are leaving this is ridiculous.\" And he walked out with his group. There were several empty tables at this point. Someone came to our table but didn't identify themselves as a manger or anything. Gave us a really half hearted apology and said they would take $3 off or a beverage off each of our checks. He seemed annoyed and said \"we are busy and restaurants make mistakes.\" Uhhhh okay. 

The food was pretty good. My steak was a bit over cooked but the potatoes were delicious. The eggs were not good at all. A few people at my table had incorrect orders but didn't want to waste more time sending them back. 

When our checks were brought out they gave them to the wrong people, most of the checks were incorrect and some didn't have the mentioned discount. So we had to wait for them to be fixed. 

Overall not a great experience, won't be back. We are a group that brunches in the area often and have already told our large networking group to avoid this spot. Good service is so much more important than good food."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Sunday morning. The wait wasn't too bad for two people close to noon. There are tons of delicious sounding options on their breakfast menu, especially the benedicts, but I finally settled on the radio scrambler because it seemed to be a little of everything. No complaints here--the scrambler was loaded with eggs, cheese, potatoes, bacon, and gravy, all piled on some beer bread. By the way, the beer bread is fantastic! Overall, it was a great meal and I hope to be back again for brunch or tapas."}
{"text":"A very interesting spot in downtown Champaign.  A tapas bar, beer bar, brunch spot on the weekends, cocktail bar, and what else?  I am probably missing something...

Tables spread out up front.  A blue lit bar, and a spinning wheel of taps.  Strange lighting, and can get very loud later at night.  Artsy and hip without being completely pretentious.  Just a little though.

Service can be a bit slow, but always friendly and knowledgeable.  Beer list is always rotating.  Founders, Dark Horse, Ballast Point, plenty of other US micros and a good selection of imports.  I think the wheel has about 30 taps.  Then a creative cocktail menu, which I have yet to try.  Outside of Blind Pig, this was one of the first true beer bars in the area.

Food is interesting.  A mix of tapas, other small plates, and brunch.  Hanger Steak is good, as is the duck.  Not everything is a hit, but there is enough good stuff to keep you coming back.  Like bone marrow, pork shoulder, and ricotta.  

This is definitely a place to check out downtown.  An interesting mix of different bar and restaurant concepts.  Good beer, interesting and often very good food.  Good spot."}
{"text":"A gem in Champaign! If you love Spanish cuisine then give this place a try! My favorite restaurant to date!"}
{"text":"Nothing at this restaurant warrants the cost. The tapas servings are tiny (for tapas); brunch is inventive but disappoints. The staff always act like you're wasting their time. This place sells an image of Euro-trendiness, but it's nothing more than that image. Go to Escobar if you want expensive food WORTH the cost."}
{"text":"Great Tapas. I want to go back for more. Wish they had better hours though. 

The parking lot attendant was rude. Couldn't wait in my car to wait for my friend to arrive. Made me not want to go into the restaurant, so I didn't. They're so worried someone might park there that isn't going to Radio Marias."}
{"text":"I came here for tapas after reading the reviews on yelp.  I love to eat tapas in my hometown and was a little skeptical whether or not this place could live up to my LA expectations.  Radio Maria did not disappoint!

First off, I loved the atmosphere.  The architecture and style of the place is so artistic and unique.  It's beautiful.  I love the artwork all over the walls and the bar area especially.  

The dim lighting and the small bites menu definitely makes it a great place to go out with friends or to go on a date.  The drinks are reasonably priced and tasty too.

I had the lamb meatballs, the bread with fig jam,  and the bread with serrano pork and orange marmalade and the potatoes.  I'm forgetting the name of each dish but they are on the tapas menu. Everything I ordered was great, but the potatoes were AMAZING!  They were crispy and had a delicious flavor because they were hickory smoked.  They also came with a delicate drizzle of the most delicious sauce, I wish I knew the ingredients so I could re-create this dish.  I can't wait to come back to have them again!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed myself here. I've dined and drank and drank and drank.

A few highlights of Radio are: 1) their Absinthe service, which is quite a production. I don't feel like I can really do it justice by describing it, but you will not be disappointed if you order up a couple Absinthe drinks. 2) They offer \"The Wheel\", which is a 3.5 oz shot of each of their beers on tap. They have about 28 beers on tap, and many are the darker craft ales, which in addition to being really tasty, are higher in proof. You need a couple of people to do this right, and there are some \"rules\", but if you are already planning on cabbing it home, this is a great way to learn about beer and get drunked. 3) Their kitchen stays open all night. 'nuff said. 4) Radio is one of the very best places to sit outside on a nice summer night. Get a table at dusk, put your back to the window and watch the night unfold."}
{"text":"Had brunch on Saturday, and it was so good we had to come back for more on Sunday. 

I had the vegetarian masa boat on Saturday, and it was absolutely delicious. The eggs were a wonderful texture, and it comes with a really great helping of goat cheese - always a plus IMO. Also had to order a side of beer bread and fried plantains, both good. The mexican coffee had a really nice flavor - I would recommend it over their regular coffee.

I had the omelet special on Sunday - blue crab, corn, celery, red pepper, with hollandaise on top. Amazing flavors, really great crab. Ordered a side of corn bread (drizzled with honey and orange marmalade), and that was pretty nice as well. Had a guava mimosa - not as much guava flavor as I had hoped, but can't argue too much with a nice helping of champagne!

I want to come back soon, especially because we saw these beakers mounted to the wall in the bar area, and our waiter told us it was their own strawberry rum."}
{"text":"Nice spot to grab a nice drink with friends or self ...a regular hangout for the local college students whom seem to handle their liquor pretty well. I'm sure this place serve food during normal business hours but a live DJ spins the latest current and throwback hiphop and urban music. Warning: no dance floor but clear a few chairs and take to the walkway and cut up a rug or two.  Drinks were decent and competitively priced ...we did patron shots and a variety of other drinks. My favorite drink of choice, which they made perfectly, is a Patron Margarita ...it was delicious. P.s ...this was on a Friday night by the way (the crowd was off and on all night but became nicely crowed around 1pm until the lights came on at 2am)."}
{"text":"Another update -- I wish this place was more consistent.  We actually had a nice tapas dinner about a month ago, and I've grown to really like the beer bar.  I enjoyed, particularly, the patas bravas (although I'm pretty sure they were using liquid smoke, although if I'm wrong please let me know).  I'm going to leave it as 2 stars now since consistency we've had such an up and down experience over the last few months, but I'll give it some more chances in the future..."}
{"text":"Vegetarian dishes were very good.  The paella was not worth the cost.  Paella need more meat or seafood and could use some vegetables as well.  Services were good"}
{"text":"My first visit to champaign and our host took us here.  I order Sangria and it is so good, not too sweet not too bitter, just right for me. Their seafood is nice and fresh and the chocolate molten is a good finish for the meal.  I like the vibe in the restaurant and the outdoor seating is a plus to the the restaurant"}
{"text":"Great place for tapas in Champaign. I agree that it's a good 'date night' place. Coming from Chicago, I find the portions of tapas to be large and inexpensive- which is great! They also have regular entrees if small plates aren't your thing. They had a good wine list, and the sangria was different ( I think there is brandy in it?) but good nonetheless. This is also a great vegetarian spot."}
{"text":"First time here...and I've heard great things about this place. First impressions were pretty good....the ambiance was good and the restaurant had a good amount of people. We started off ordering a tapas as our appetizer...the apple salad. It was very disappointing. The apples were not cut to order and were not crisp even though it was stored in a container of lemon juice. The bacon was not reheated...I mean who likes cold bacon? For pur entrees we ordered the scallops and duck meatloaf. The scallops were good however I personally didnt appreciate the jam that went with it...could have done with a spicy savory sauce. The duck was unknowingly served with the same exact jam. It was a tad too sweet for our tastes, but regardless of that...the meatloaf was absolutely amazing. The egg that topped it however was a bit overcooked so the sunnyside up yolk could not be used as a sauce. Our final conclusion is that the main part of the entreeswere cooked to order, as they should be, but all the garnish was precooked and we got the feeling that it was just thrown on...not worth the price."}
{"text":"Cheese balls with mushroom, goat cheese. This place was out of this world with the creativeness of the appetizers. I'd definitely go back there and continue to explore their menu. The drinks were very good and from what I can remember there's more I need to explore on that front also!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere of this restaurant is a combination of modern hippie chic. There is beautifully hand crafted bar that encompasses colored glass, various rotating art strung throughout, and exposed brick.  

I had the Brier Patch to drink (I hope I remembered the name correctly).  Watching the bartender make it, I could see how much pride she took in creating the various meticulous drinks and I was not disappointed.  It was full of berry flavor without being overly sweet.

For dinner I ordered scallops on top of a fried risotto pancake with layer of arugula and goat cheese. The scallops were cooked perfectly and cut like butter. I can't describe the taste of my dish except that it was like nothing that I have ever had before.

I highly recommend that you come and check out this restaurant. If I am ever in town again I will be back!"}
{"text":"Enjoy the brunch here on Sundays but that is usually the only time we eat here. The Lloyds omelet is great and you can sub grits or a biscuit for beer bread if you ask. Good draft beer selection."}
{"text":"Radio Maria is good. Not great, but good. 
Their brunches are much better than their dinners, and I'd probably give them a 4 for brunch. There are some good things to be found for dinner, but you have to search. The menus are a bit unwieldy.
No complaints on the cocktails at all, and they always have a really good beer selection. I'd be more inclined to come here for drinks or brunch than I would for dinner.
And, one bizarre thing that I can't get past - their cheese plates. Who puts feta on a cheese plate? There are lots of good cheeses around this area, so it seems crazy to have a below-average cheese plate."}
{"text":"I am straight up in LOVE with the fried goat cheese balls at radio maria. i was super excited to go and enjoy some of the deliciousness that is the food, however, last week i went in with a friend and we were seated and then literally sat there for 7 minutes before someone came over to us. I was just the hostess, who said that a waiter would be over in a minute. That minute was another 7 minutes, and we didn't even have a drink order in, so we got up to leave (as we were super hungry.) The hostess shrugged and was totally unapologetic about the terrible service, so we went to jupiter's and had some delicious pizza and beers for 1/4 the price of what we were going to order."}
{"text":"This is a neat place. They have some excellent food with one of the better drink menus in town. Their beer selection is hard to beat. They have plenty to please the roving beer snobs. I can always find an obscure beer that I've never encountered. One of my favorite up-scale places in the area."}
{"text":"The food was solid but the service, the last couple of times I was there, was a little lacking.  The servers were not all that attentive to our needs and our drinks were never refilled through the meal.  This place is a local favorite and definitely somewhere to visit."}
{"text":"I'm starting to think these guys spread themselves a bit too thin.

At brunch yesterday we were overwhelmed by how many options there were, with 14 regular offerings or so, about eight different omelettes, and then a dozen specials.  Yikes! 

Unfortunately, most of us were underwhelmed with the food.  My wife's Italian omelette lacked a kick--add some fresh garlic, perhaps?  The two of us whose dishes included the \"house made\" chorizo were disappointed at the sausage's lack of flavor--either spice it up or use store-bought, folks!

The mediocre food was made up for by the wonderful decor and overall experience.  As a Chicagoan with family in Champaign I'm jealous that a place like this exists, so inexpensive, with so much variety on the menu and 37 beers on tap (next door at the Tapas Bar)!  If they spent some time tweaking the dishes they have and adding that extra something many of them miss, they could become a truly top-notch restaurant for brunch.

UPDATE: Went to the tapas-bar portion of RM the other night and was really pleased with the dishes.  A few traditional tapas but mostly inventive twists using spanish ingredients, like lightly battered asparagus with serrano ham and manchego cheese and seared avocado  stuffed with quinoa.  Really tasty stuff, and goes great with one of the 25 draft beers (most of which cost four bucks)."}
{"text":"This is our favorite brunch spot. They always have rotating specials for me, the adventurous one and biscuits and gravy for my boyfriend. The Flaming Frida is delicious. Don't waste your time on the bloody mary bar. They never have any garnishes that are worth the money - no meats and cheeses here. Thats my main complaint, the bloody marys don't have enough garnishes. You're lucky to get an olive. I will also say that, depending on the day, the service can be really slow."}
{"text":"Our whole family loves Spanish food and since we were all in Champaign for the football game we decided to check out a \"new to us\" Tapas restaurant.

When we arrived at 2:45, the kitchen was not open but would reopen in 15 minutes.  We decided we could easily wait so we snagged two tables outside and ordered drinks.  The waiter delivered the drinks and took our tapas order so he could put in the order as soon as the kitchen opened which was a marvelous idea!  Before you knew it we were sipping on Sangria and our food began to arrive.

We tried the cheese plate which was outstanding.  I could have just eaten that and been happy.  The mussels were grilled which had a pleasant taste but the grilling did dry them out.  The biggest disappointment was the Spanish tortilla, the traditional egg and potato omelet of Spain.  This had been prepared like more of a quiche and no one at the table liked or ate it.  I adored the fantastic lamb meatballs, we even ate the sauce with some of the bread which came with the cheese plate.  The other tapa I tried were the marinated olives which were not nearly as good as I had expected.  The marinade was so vinegary, not a smooth flavor at all.  I would not order that again.  We shared everything but there were some dishes I didn't try as I had ordered paella for my entree.

The paella was really really good.  It had a spicy chorizo but it did not overpower the overall rich saffron/olive oil taste of the dish.  The rice part was outstanding and the chicken and seafood were generous and tender. What a treat!  I had partaken of too many tapas so my husband had to finish mine, now that is a generous portion.

We had a great meal, my sangria mellowed me out after like 4 sips, the Illini had won and the weather was beautiful.  When the sizable check arrived I might have blanched at bit under normal circumstances but my husband and I just laughed and put it on a credit card.

It was a great meal with the family but very expensive.   Next game, those kids are getting pizza or burgers!  

 ¡Olé!"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch , hot cinnamon rolls were fantastic  all three in our party had the same thing which was the radio Maria stack. Which had everything you want In a big breakfast   By the way it was delicious. Waiter was very friendly also
Forgot to mention  the interior design of this place was very attractive and comfortable"}
{"text":"Reservation DOESN'T mean you are getting a seat! Our reservation was half an hour ago, the hostess still hasn't seated us. Her attitude was despicable and she insisted that reservation only means that you get priority over walk-ins and NOT a seat of your reserved time. Does she not know what the word reservation mean??? The point of making a reservation is getting a table at the reserved time!"}
{"text":"REVIEW FOR BRUNCH ONLY

I love the hipster/retro ambience of Radio Maria, but I was definitely less impressed with their brunch. They have a large menu ranging from more traditional (i.e., eggs benedict) to more Spanish inspired (i.e., tamales) dishes. I tried the pork posole but found it to be rather lacking in pork flavor. The pork came shredded on the side, which I think is the first mistake: how are you supposed to infuse that meat flavor without cooking it in the stew? My friend said her pulled pork dish lacked some flavor as well, so maybe that's a theme here. On top of that, my poached eggs were seriously undercooked. There's nothing more disturbing than cutting into your eggs to see cloudy egg whites run into your stew...I will give a shout out to their beer bread, though. It's dense, moist, and they sear it on both sides to give an extra little crunchy texture. I'd come back for that alone.

I also tried their Flaming Maria, which is a bloody mary made with their house-infused tequila (infused with dill, garlic, hot peppers, and I can't remember what else). It was delish, but only get this if you're able to handle the heat because it was spicy, even by my standards!

Take home: come to Radio Maria for the beer bread, cocktails, and retro ambience, but I would skip the food."}
{"text":"This place is honestly a world class Spanish food/Tapas place.  The service is always awesome and they have a constantly changing menu that always includes things like cheese plates, steaks, fish, frog legs, with their goat cheese boursin stuff in lots of things.  Another reason going there is their great bar that has a beer selection which will please anyone who is as geeky about american craft beer as I am :-)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure way anyone couldn't give this unique place 5 Stars!!  I'm from here, but have lived in LA for 35 years.  Radio Maria is better than most LA restaurants!!
The food was amazing we had Pork Tacos !!  So delish!  I had the \"Sea Glass\" Pinot which is new for me but so smooth and pleasing.  There was a guy in the corner which started putting on some enticing music!  Our Bartender was on top of it!!  I just can't recommend this place more highly!!  Check it out!!"}
{"text":"I've been a few times for drinks and tapas and Radio Maria is fine, good even, but it just feels a little pretentious and fussy sometimes. I really want to like the place more but I just don't."}
{"text":"I had a boss who was obsessed with this place.  They have good hummus and I like the fried plantains.  Otherwise, it's fine.  Brunch is the best time to go."}
{"text":"Four stars for atmosphere on the bar side.  Four stars for the service at the bar and at the tables.  5 stars for the Green Curry Hot Pot...should've ordered 2!  Man that is a fine and tasty dish!  Phenomenal draft selection and craft drinks, plus quality on the old standbys.  #winning"}
{"text":"I love Radio Maria! I used to go here with my parents sometimes when they came to visit me as a student. This weekend my husband and I were in town for a board meeting and had a pleasant dinner. We sat outside because the weather was great.

Delicious mojitos for both of us. We had the roasted garlic on toast, a potatoes with chorizo and egg tapas, and the filet mignon entree special with roasted brussels sprouts and pearl onions, radishes, mustard and cheddar. Absolutely to die for!!

We will definitely return on another trip to the CU."}
{"text":"I believe they got a new chef semi recently... Didn't think much of this place a few years ago but now think it's one of the best spots for a good dinner in c-u"}
{"text":"Radio Maria has great and unique food! I went on a date here and absolutely loved it! Every dish is most likely something you would never think of creating but it will be soo good!  The selection of wines is excellent as well!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Radio Maria. Delicious and unique food, very cool artsy atmosphere, and wonderful service (Aaron is my favorite!). I go here for every special occasion. The tapas and brunch are both fantastic, and the bar is good too. The artwork that decorates the place was all made by local artists. They play good music as well (jazz and chill electronic music mostly). My favorites here are the arancini, patatas, and the Mexican coffee. 

Absolutely can't say enough good things about this place, I can't believe it only has 3.5 stars on Yelp. Just too many salty people leaving bad reviews I guess!"}
{"text":"Been there many times over the years, and the restaurant went down the hill. Service is awful and very slow, portions small, ingredients often inferior, and food overpriced for its quality and portion size. Seared tuna was not even chewable, lamb balls dry, potato tapas prepared ma-a-any days before we visited. They used to have tasty ox tail as tapas; now it disappeared, though remains on the menu, and the waiters lie that \"we ran out of it today.\" The only reason to go is a huge list of draft beers."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service tonight. Fifteen minutes to get three draft beers? Twenty minutes to get the check? While we were waiting we saw our waiter standing around and talking to another server and our beers were sitting on the bar getting warm. We got there at 5pm and were the only table and left at 6:30ish when there couldn't have been more than 7 or 8 tables.

Food was good. But not worth the price for the bad waitstaff."}
{"text":"I've eaten here on average of around eight times a year since 2007. I've come to the conclusion that Radio Maria doesn't care about not being good because they've established their niche in a town with so few good options, allowing them to stay in business despite the downside. 

I've always had really good servers and bartenders here. Some of the menu dishes can be really good, but subject to inconsistent execution. Some of the menu dishes are downright bad by any standard. A vanilla cream sauce doesn't complement goat cheese, for example. It isn't interesting. It's just kind of awful."}
{"text":"Radio Maria is one of my favorite Sunday brunch spots in the area. 

The Mexican coffee is quite sweet, so you may want to avoid it if you don't typically take sugar with your coffee. 

The highlight of the Migas dish would be the black beans - they are so well seasoned and contain a hint of lime. The eggs contain a good amount and variety of vegetables. 

The vegetarian eggs benedict was also tasty. The eggs were poached perfectly and we're paired well with the soft avocados and tomatoes. The house potatoes are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside - just the way I liked them. 

Radio Maria can definitely accommodate large parties, and I would recommend making a reservation ahead of time to avoid a wait!"}
{"text":"Made the mistake of coming here for brunch Homecoming weekend. The service was incredibly slow. Took over an hour to get two breakfast dishes. I didn't get drinks but it did seem like people were enjoying their drinks orders. 

I ordered huevos rancheros with chorizo which is something I thought was hard to mess up. After the wait I was expecting greatness but this restaurant did not deliver. Eggs were over salted and the presentation was not appealing. Don't think I'll be back again."}
{"text":"I've never had tapas before so there's might not be too much credibility in my review but the food was okay. portions were small and very expense. We ordered a paella ($20) but it came out to be the size of a small tapas so that was kind of disappointing. The servers were super friendly and hipster so definitely fun people to talk to. The wine was really good and the environment was top notch. However, I don't think i will be coming back but it was definitely something I wanted to experience at least once living in Champaign."}
{"text":"Had brunch there on Sunday with 8 people.  1 vegetarian and 1 very picky eater.  We loved it.  Everything was spectacular.  Only downfall - not enough of the potatoes which were incredible!  Had the smoked trout omelette which was soooo good."}
{"text":"Food is solidly good but not brilliant compared to tapas places I've been in other towns.  That being said I enjoyed the food and definitely will come back - it's creative, fresh, and varied.
Kind of weird to have two kitchens/two menus that aren't coordinated - they start with an apology for it.
Wine and beer list is plenty long and varied - flavors for everyone.  Plus, Tuesday is 1/2 off wine by the glass night - how can you beat that?
Specials were very tasty - Mahi-mahi in parchment, and a local organic heirloom tomato salad w/orange zest and balsamic - yummy!
Outside tables are great on a warm summer evening.
Service at times a bit slow although great service attitude and personality by our server - as with any restaurant it depends on the person you get and the night you go...
Agree with 3+ stars."}
{"text":"Let me walk you through my dining experience this morning. We arrived at the restaurant at 11:40 am, waited to be greeted by the hostess, waited while the hostess decided where to seat us, and she abruptly walked away from the hostess stand without a word and expected us to follow so eventually we did, she had no clue where she planned to seat us so we walked around the entire restaurant following her like kids who had no friends at lunchtime. We had no water or no greeting from any server or bus boy until 20 minutes after we arrived. Our server finally arrived and gave a weak apology and blamed the hostess for the reason he didn't acknowledge us. We finally ordered and waited 45 minutes for food only for us to be served only 2/3 of our meals with us not having any silverware, as we waited for our silverware and as our food got cold we noticed one of our meals were made incorrectly after the server argued that it was right he finally took it back and when he returned he told us that our third meal one was dropped and they couldn't remake it so we waited for a replacement meal and one member of our party had to sit and watch the other two eat for 20 minutes while she waited for her meal. I was disgusted when they handed us our checks at the end of the meal, I was sure that atleast they would've comped the Neal we waited over an hour for and when I brought this concern up to the server he said \"every one here has been waiting over an hour so it's not anything different\". I proceeded to ask for management and after waiting another 15 minutes we were greeted by a \"manager\" but we frequent this restaurant and have had him as our server on server all occasions, so that was shameful enough. Then both the server named Jeanluc and the \"manager\", a shorter bald African American man who didn't offer his name, proceeded to literally yell at us. When we didn't back down he yelled out \"I'll fix it\" and stormed off. No apology, no concern, nothing. 2 hours wasted.

I have never had a more frustrating and disappointed experience, I have also never not tipped a server as I have worked as one before and I understand people and restaurants have bad days but this was uncanny. Not one staff member was nice or accommodating, the \"manager\" was the worst of them all. I work at the only hotel in the downtown champaign area and not only do I usually recommend this place to my friends but also to the guests who visit champaign, and you can guarantee this is so far removed from my recommendation list. I will NOT be back, and will try to save my friends and guests from being treated as I just was too."}
{"text":"Friendly, quick. We were in before dinner norm hours.  Small portion on garlic shrimp , pork tacos stale shell. Salsa was tasty, pork bland.  Nice looking place."}
{"text":"The food seems extremely simple for their prices. I have eaten brunch and dinner here and the food is really not that amazing.   The drinks are always good and I never go downtown without having a little white lie!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Went there for a late dinner.  Love the bar, love the atmosphere.  Ate off the Tapas Menu....Food was the best!!! The Scallops melted in your mouth! Wine was great...service was great!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"?????????????????"}
{"text":"Awesome beer and wine selection, probably one of the best in the city. I mean, they serve absinthe! The atmosphere is great, very nicely lit inside, the bar its awesome, and they always have some crazy art on the walls.

I also really love their tapas, it's a great spot to go on a date. Everything I've had there was suuuuper delicious. I also love their specials and they seem to have new ones all the time."}
{"text":"5 for service. You get this blond hair female bartender, go to her!!!  She's totally awesome and makes good recommendation.  Food isn't bad either. 

Why the 4 stars?  Yo, I ordered the chocolate de wannabe creme brûlée thingamajig and it only came with two slits of ginger snaps cookies (like the kind you pay 3 bucks for at ikea). I ordered two more of them rectangles and they charged me 50 cents!  They charged me 50 cents for two rectangles of a graham cracker (remember a whole graham cracker has 4 rectangles).  Man, as I eat those cookies I lost my appetite for the dessert (rarely happens). I didn't even want to take it home.  I felt like I got carjacked and I wasn't even driving. Carjacked by ginger snap cookies, from ikea!!! Wtf!? 

Ahhh, but I'll be back. I'll just stay away from them cookies."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for brunch. Everything was delicious! I got the caprese omelet, and my friend got the lobster omelet. The beer bread and potatoes that come with the omelet were so good! We also tried the mexican coffee. It doesn't taste that good with the food. It tastes better on its own. It's something you won't regret trying. It's sweet and has a strong cinnamon flavor. Service was pretty slow, but we were okay with that this time. I highly recommend going to Radio Maria for brunch! I would love to try their lunch and dinner menu as well :)"}
{"text":"Our server (tall, slender, red-headed male in late 20s-early 30s) was SHIT HAMMERED and it made our dining experience very awkward!!! He forgot nearly everything that we asked for and we had to remind him several times to put in our drink and food orders. He kept apologizing and making excuses that he was busy... but there were very few other customers in the restaurant!! He had no idea what the specials were. He didn't know the difference between our drinks when he finally brought them to the table. At one point, he plopped down next to me in the booth and was mumbling something and drunkenly pointing at the menu and his breath was UNBEARABLE in my face!!! When we finally got our food, he went to the bar area and creepily watched us as we tried to enjoy it. He \"check up\" on us every 3-4 minutes and kept trying to take our drinks that were still half full. We tried to be polite and just get through dinner without making a scene - we just wanted him to leave us alone!! I don't even remember how the food was because we were so UNCOMFORTABLE. We will absolutely NOT be returning as customers."}
{"text":"The ambience at the bar is really exceptional.  We always sit at the bar for tapas.. You must be in an experimental mood, this food is nowhere near \"normal bar food\".  The sea scallops and the seared tuna will make you crave more.  The bartender can accomodate any request, with a passion.  We have him making key lime pie martinis, and they rock.   Fun place. Ultra Cool. Super Hip."}
{"text":"On a return trip from the mid west, we were lucky to walk into Radio Maria.  From the outside it wasn't very impressive.  Once inside, we took a seat a the bar.  The bartender was really knowledgeable and there was a great selection of beer, wine and spirits.  The menu runs from an inventive tapas list to unique entrees.  We were blown away by both the house smoked pork tacos and the duck breast salad.  
Between the wonderful bar and the outstanding food, we will be stopping back next time we are able to come through Champaign!"}
{"text":"I loved the decor in the new Radio Maria Tapas bar, but I was NOT crazy about the tapas.  The olives in our manchego baked olive dish had a bizarre citrus note that was rather offputting, and were way short on manchego.  Our apple blue cheese spread appeared to be apple-free, and the blue cheese spread itself was runny.  

My bloody mary was top notch; I'll have to do some serious research to figure out whether it surpasses guido's for best bloody mary down town."}
{"text":"Addicting Brunch. MANY veggie options"}
{"text":"I'll give you reasons to visit Radio Maria if you haven't already:

1. It's one of the better places in downtown CU. Great date spot, low nights, vintage-y decor (I believe they took old theater parts and gave them a modern twist). Friendly servers, not sure about the hosts, but hey! The hosts won't be serving you anyway.
2. Go so you can say you have, then you can write your own snobby bullet point review. Go for dinner, not brunch.
3. Be safe, use Yelp protection. You can't go dislike tapas or any of the steak entrees (unless you're vegetarian). Also, give ox tail a try. You'll wish you started chasing tail earlier."}
