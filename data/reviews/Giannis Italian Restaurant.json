{"text":"My favourite of the many good Italian Restaurants in Scarborough. The restaurant itself is quite small so I would advise booking in advance.


 The food is superb and the service always friendly, the atmosphere is always good due to the restaurants small intimate nature.


 The chef is a star at cooking anything but I highly recommend the fresh fish (or any seafood for that matter).


 Scarborough is well populated by Italian restaurants and while some let the side down, restaurants like Giannis keep the flag waving at full mast. Superb restaurant."}
{"text":"Gianni's has been a mainstay in scarborough for more years than i care to mention. The food is always great and the service impecable. It is the only place i've ever found a red masala too"}
{"text":"Gianni's alongside Florios are the standout Italian style restaurants in Scarborough.
The location is great, the layout is great and the food is great.
Always give this place 5 out of 5 every visit I make."}
{"text":"Gianni's is just one of many Italian restaurants in Scarborough town centre. It is quite a small restaurant and booking in advance is necessary a lot of the time. The owner and his staff are very friendly and help to make your meal at the restaurant very enjoyable. They have a very extensive menu, with everything you would expect from an Italian. As well as their standard menu they do have some very nice specials especially starters. The food is very reasonably priced, you can enjoy a meal for around Â£15 per person (starter and main course) and I would really recommend the house white, which is delicious and not too expensive."}
{"text":"Big mistake, people kept telling us that the meals were not as good, we tried and I have to agree. Steak we asked for medium well, however still bleeding alot, I wondered if a defibrilator would have got it mooing again?? Coffee liqueur was barely luke warm, complained and just got another bill without the coffee on. Will not return, pity, used to be good."}
{"text":"Came on a Monday night and it was relatively quiet. They have recently (January) revamped the place and moved the bar. Whilst it does look modern and stylish I feel it has lost some of its character and warmth. The downstairs front is decorated in a masked ball theme and the bar area is a shrine to Ferrari.
Wine list is ok with a litre bottle of house red for 12.00
Early bird menu which is dependent on when your order is taken and not when you arrive. This can be exasperating when one is sat ready to order, the minutes ticking away, but the staff are busy with other diners.
For starters they very kindly did me the hot seafood platter for two for one. The consisted of three complete prawns (head, tail legs etc) but unfortunately two of them also came complete with the digestive tract so I could not face eating them. There were about eight mussels and half a dozen squid rings. The mussels were well cooked but the squid was bland. The liquor they were cooked in was fine but why they then chucked a load of lettuce over it all was beyond me. My partner had a baked goats cheese and that was acceptable. For my main I had a 16 oz ribeye steak. This was nice but alongside it was a vast pile of sauteed mushroom which, as time went by, leeched out all their moisture leaving my steak swimming in a garlicy, salty liquid.
My partner and pork escalopes with cheese and sage which was very tasty. The accompanying veg were also fresh and tasty but short on potatoes.
For dessert we had homemade Tiramisu and a cheesecake. Both were bland and tasteless.
There are far better Italians in town (Cogonis, Da-Claudio, Lanterna) but I would say this fills the gap below them and above the frantic Florios (which is fine but not for a quiet meal). The food that I saw going to other tables looked fine and everyone seemed happy. If I came here again I would avoid busy times and take advantage of the early bird menu."}
