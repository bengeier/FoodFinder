{"text":"I had an order of haddock and onion rings. The fish was perfectly cooked and the batter is delicious and not too thick. The onion rings were cooked but i like them crispy. Still delicious. If i could give a half star i would have.

Eaten here and the other Heritage locations in Brampton many times in the past. Always a good choice."}
{"text":"Very good quality fish and chips.  I lived in Brampton for a bit and found this place and got hooked.  I get the 2 piece haddock with half chips well done.  I've had fish and chips all over the world and I always come back here!"}
{"text":"Had a craving and didn't feel like cooking so we decided to get some fish and chips. 
They ran out of cod so we had haddock and chips instead. We were given sachets of malt vinegar and tartar sauce as we made an order for collection. 
The haddock was just okay. Wouldn't order it again. There was something else battered in with my haddock box and it tasted like cod to me, was delicious anyway so il be back to try other things!
The place was busy and there's a separate take away section, and an Irish shop attached for all treats and sweets which is great, as I didn't know we had somewhere handy to us!
Chips (fries) were yummy and you wouldn't think there would be enough in the box (so ordered extra portion of chips but there was really no need.. we were stuffed and the tartar sauce was lovely too! 
Plenty of parking outside as it is beside no frills and other stores off the roadside so.."}
{"text":"Excellent fish and chips. My wife gets the halibut and I get the haddock. I'm not very fond of their chips, but I'm definitely in the minority.

Generous portions, well-prepared, reasonably priced. Service is spotty.

Don't go here on Good Friday... two hour wait for takeout."}
{"text":"The fish is amazing! Great taste! Well cooked! The halibut was hot and tender! The scallops were perfectly cooked, though the batter tended to fall off. The shrimp was great - they had been trimmed so no hard tails. I also added a side of fried pickles, which were very tasty! I understand from another customer that the fried mars bar was very good! The only drawback to the meal was the chips, which are placed under the fish, was a bit soggy and not especially tasty. Felt they needed a bit more time and more seasoning. Overall, definitely recommend this, and will be back!"}
{"text":"Discovered the secret to this place! Order take-out, not dine-in...you get twice as much food. 
 Honestly, the four of us had four haddock, three fries, one onion ring, one battered mushrooms and one large mushy peas. It only cost $42 and we all went into carb comas afterwards. Each order of haddock was at least three sizable chunks of fish...and I do mean fish, not 75% batter. There was no way any of us could finish the fries, and the mushrooms weren't really needed either. Good real mushy peas, as usual. I get unnecessarily irritated when cooking shows claim that \"mushy peas\" can be made with mashed frozen peas, not dried marrowfats...but hey, we all have issues.
 PS: As with all chippies nowadays, steer clear of the halibut. That fish is as overpriced as Chilean Sea Bass. Never really understood why people are prepared to pay big bucks for fish that doesn't even taste like fish. It was great when it was a couple of bucks more than haddock or cod, but now it's at least twice the price. 
 That's my review/neurotic rant for today."}
{"text":"Fish and chips is great! Fishermans platter is not worth $17.99!! Felt really ripped off and I think I got more for our $8 fish and chips meal! They give you fish and chips plus 4 calamari pieces - Boourns! Not justifiable!! Cooks are kinda crusty to the cashiers, very comedic place to watch them argue over nothing ! Don't stray away from what they do best. Fish and chippies!!!!"}
{"text":"this place serves up great halibut and chips, a fairly large portio, not all batter and teh chips are good to......probably the best in Brampton, with multiple locations...."}
{"text":"VERY expensive ($14 for a single piece of halibut, no chips) and on this visit the fish was overlooked and tough. The fries were also completely without taste."}
{"text":"I had the Pacific Halibut with fries here for dinner last nite. I have no idea why people would rate this a 4-star. I though it was more of a 2-star. I used the game out for my selection & also had a side of coleslaw. I found the coleslaw to be very dry. The chips were undercooked (even though I asked to have them well done-twice). Despite my request the fries were a little soggy. The Halibut was decent but the WAY more batter them fish. The flavour was very bland & even with the addition of generic tartar sauce it was barely passable. The other thing that really bugged me...no name ketchup. If you're gonna call yourself \"authentic fish & chips\" you need to have Heinz Ketchup with the fries!!"}
