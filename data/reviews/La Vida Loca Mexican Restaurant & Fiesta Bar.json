{"text":"Decided to give the place a try, as a couple friends and I were starving and trying to stay away from some of the \"pub grub\" available on 17th. We decided to try La Vida Loca, and boy were our expectations blown out of the water.   We started with a beer, and tried the guacamole and tortilla chips that's made fresh at your table. Our server was very attentive (keeping a smile throughout the difficult process of making the guac at our table!), friendly and made some excellent recommendations for food. The guac was excellent, and the chips, as with everything else on the menu. I tried the huarche with chicken in mole, which was fantastic. It really tastes like what you'd imagine Mexican home cooking would taste like. The food tastes like it's made from scratch, organic (unconfirmed), and to top it off they had a friendly singer playing there.   Great experience for a Monday night, and it appeared to be busy. Glad to see this spot, which has been riddled with uninspired attempts at a bar/pub turn into something that will be very successful. It's unpretentious, laid-back, and you'll love the food and service. Will definitely be recommending this to family and friends!  Kevin"}
{"text":"Ordered tortilla soup and enchiladas, very spicy , staff super friendly and respectful, cozy atmosphere and a fantastic experience overall. Will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Thought we would try this over our usual place los chilotos. The service was terrible. Took a long time just to get the first drink as well as being served. The margaritas were good with there use of real fruit puree but felt a bit light on the tequila. I feel like you should actually be able to taste it, as well the use seasoned salt over regular.  The food was decent. Definitely worth the 6$ taco Monday but not sure if I would pay full price..  Overall I can't say I would recommend or return to this place. The price was a bit high and the service was terrible."}
{"text":"La Vida Loca serves authentic Mexican food in Calgary. I'll admit, I've not been to other Mexican restaurants in town, but I'm not sure I will either. The food at La Vida Loca is fantastic! I especially loved the tableside guacamole and the enchiladas with the green sauce. Service was solid as well; the GM was attentive to everything that was going on in the restaurant. It's clear that the La Vida Loca that is operating now is very different from the one in the reviews from back when they first opened. People who have written the restaurant off before should give it a second chance. Well worth it! I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"I attended a fundraiser event held here on a Tuesday night. It is much nicer and cozier inside than it looks from the storefront on 17th! Not a fancy place, but since its fairly new (I think they opened Sept. 2013), you can tell the renovations turned out really well for them - they did the best they could with the long and narrow space.  Food was quite good - I don't normally expect food at these types of events to be that tasty but I was pleasantly surprised. Pricing and portion size for a quesadilla seems on par with a restaurant like Earls or Moxies but tasted way better - try the chicken mole or chorizo. Salsa and guac are good. (Burrito is also quite large - a guy at our table couldn't even finish his!) I think they forgot the alcohol in my margarita but it was a free drink ticket so I didn't bother complaining. Dessert was churros, which were delicious! The chocolate dipping sauce kind of tasted like nesquick but fortunately the strawberry sauce tasted like real fruit! Overall, I am not a connoisseur of Mexican food so can't speak for how authentic everything was.  There was some live music during parts of the event; the performer played the guitar and sang in Spanish. I believe he is a regular there for certain nights a week and it helped add to the atmosphere for the event. Service was also friendly and fairly quick given that it was a full house!  I would definitely go back and give the other menu items a try!"}
{"text":"Ill keep this short and sweet. Loved the service, the owner was super nice. Great live music and of course yummy food. A great place to go to with friends or on a date."}
{"text":"Was there on a Saturday night- cozy atmosphere, the service was very friendly & always prompt! Had the enchiladas & beef tacos both were tasty- they had live music after 10 which was great as well. They have a great drink menu with a variety of Mexican bulldogs & other tasty treats. I can't put my finger on it but I like this place- it just has a good vibe- will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am in love with the tortilla soup from here. It is hot (the way I like it) and tastes amazing."}
{"text":"Can anyone go here without singing Ricky Martin in their head? Or out loud like my GF and I did? Lol  Take advantage of their HUGE patio that overlooks 17th ave!  On a warm sunny day, the big umbrellas provide the perfect amount of shade as you enjoy some drinks and delish tacos. The pork belly ones are a bit greasy but the fresh cilantro, arugula and spicy avocado salsa tones down the fattiness.  Service can be a bit slow when it's not busy, but if you're catching up with friends and not really minding your time, it's perfect spot."}
{"text":"Food-wise, this place was alright. The margaritas are especially tasty.  However, the service here was terrible. We sat at our table for a half hour before we finally pulled aside a server and asked \"are you our waitress?\" and she replied \"i guess i could be\" with a very snarky tone.  She then spent the entire evening getting our orders wrong, forgetting that we ordered something (including a guacamole which we had to remind her about three times and she still got the order wrong) , and being INCREDIBLY rude when we reminded her about our food/complained about getting the wrong food.   I have honestly never had such a terrible service experience in my life. I won't be returning, and I recommend that others spend their money elsewhere."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a change of pace, Latin music, amazing crab tacos, and ice cold bulldogs... Go no further! This has got to be by far my favorite place to hit up on 17th ave! From the moment you are seated to the moment you leave, I can guarantee you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been here in the past and had great service. The food was good. But tonight something was off. Extremely slow service. My fajita came out in the pan that was NOT sizzling. It was Luke warm at best I had to have them send it back and it being a shrimp dish obviously ended up tasting rubbery. I used to recommend this restaurant over other Mexican restaurant but I can no longer do that. The waitress was friendly but I feel that they were extremely understaffed. I hope this restaurant can get back to how it used to be. The owners need to be around more and ensure that everyone is having a great dining experience."}
{"text":"9/10 enchiladas pollo verde Pollo means chicken Verde means green.  Talkin anout the salsa  Surprisingly good!  Cool summer patio. For cool people only"}
{"text":"Second time coming here, absolutely amazing wonderful food!! Left here with a happy tummy! Friendly service, and quality flavour! Fair prices and good ambience ! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"First time visiting here. We love Mexican food. The service was fast and friendly. My sangria was delicious and only $6 and the Enchiladas were seriously delicious."}
{"text":"had chicken tacos.  Horrible, bland.  1 star for the guacamole seemed ok.  Chicken tasted like it was cooked months ago.  You'll get fresher chicken frozen from a supermarket and then kept in your freezer for 10 years and steamed with no spice.  The guacamole on it was totez non-traditional, and was the only vegetables that came with the taco.  tacos at a minimum come with onions and cilantro at 'LEAST'.   The closed off kitchen definitly should cause worries.    This is as far away from \"traditional\" mexican food as taco-time is or taco-bell.  Just head to El charritos on 10th ave in kensington if you really need mexican food.     I guess if you just want some nachos or chips and guacamole, this is probobly the go-to spot.  But why go to a restaurant to have that?  Buy some avocados and chips and enjoy at home.  Some restaurants are ridiculous and expect people to spend money on a night out on completely frozen everything or ridiculously simple things.  Whats next?  a restaurant that servers you crackerbarrel chedder still in the package with soda crackers - still in the box for 20$?? hilarious"}
{"text":"My husband and I showed up here tonight by accident. Children were standing on their chairs outside and the waitresses weren't cleaning the tables. We decided to go inside instead. We just sat down and I placed my hand on the seat and cut my finger on either a broken glass shard or small sharp rock, perhaps from a child's shoe? I can't tell you what the food's like,  we left, I'll never return."}
{"text":"I was in the area on my lunch break so decided to grab something to take back to work. I got the chicken and avocado huaraches and it was decent. Not bad, not fantastic. I see some pretty bad reviews on other sites but I didn't have a problem with what I got. The brown sauce (salsa?) was super spicy (and I like some spice) so I just chose not to eat it.  Am I going back tomorrow? Nope. Would I be willing to give it another shot? Yep."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday at lunchtime, it wasn't too busy. Nice day and 2 other tables seated on the patio. I had the taco salad and it was okay. Seemed a little expensive though for what it was but it was good.  Service was slow, we were there on lunch and it took us over an hour from getting there to getting food and finishing up so probably wouldn't try it at lunch again since we usually need to be in and out quicker."}
{"text":"Food was ok, server seemed put out,  We were the only group for lunch, six of us for lunch, they only had one client for then entire lunch break.    The food mediocre at best and and out bill was over $160. Disappointed that they don't take American Express, I usually have better dining experiences at restaurants that take all cards and this continues to be my experience.  I won't be back and I know my coworkers won't be either."}
{"text":"Oh man... we were so pumped for our Mexican Feast last Friday... We've heard so many good things about the food at LA Vida Loca! And we were absolutely thrilled with everything we ate.  The appetizer of crab taco served in a shot glass was divine! And we tried two tacos, pork belly , corn breaded shrimp (meh) and shrimp fajitas .. the calamari was not my fave, but my man friend loved them.    Sadly, this was some of the worst service we've experienced in Calgary.   There were 2 large table (one of about 20 people and one of about 10 people ) one small table of 2 and then us... After we were sat no one brought us menus.  At all.  I had to get up and steal them off a dirty table behind us (that remained dirty the entire time we were there .)  About 15 minutes after arriving we were finally asked if we wanted a drink.  Our appies arrived immediately afterwards, and then all of our food all at once.  We are big eaters, so a table full of food is nothing new, and we inhaled every last crumb:)  the food was sooooooo good.  We are eager to return, as we loved loved the food, but the complete lack of service will definitely postpone our return visit."}
{"text":"Lovely server , nice patio and tacos/margarita combo for 6 bucks. 'Nuff said.  Is it the most amazing Mexican ever ? Nah. But it's a fun stop on your tasting/drinking tour up 17th Ave"}
{"text":"Would give this place zero stars if I could! This place is awful. The service is awful. We waited an hour for our food, 20 minutes for a corona! It felt like everyone was served before us. shortly, shortly, shortly was the answer we continued to get. We ordered tacos, which should be quick, because they are a popular appetizer item. Come on man! The food was over priced and not worth the wait. Will never come back and suggest you don't either. You know what's the worst? Your dinner conversation being - where's the food? I'm so hungry!"}
{"text":"Pretty good Mexican food.  We went on a Wednesday and they had a live guitarist and singer there.  On Wednesday they also have 2 for $5 tacos.  A really good deal.  The food was authentic and tasty.  They had a variety of hot sauces to choose from as well as a good selection of drinks (including Mexican cervezas).  Our server was quite cheerful and always checking up on us."}
