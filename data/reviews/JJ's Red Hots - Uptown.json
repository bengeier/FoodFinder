{"text":"Not as great as the east blvd. location. Went with a group of friends, we all got ours in maybe 5 minutes  wait time while the last friend waited 15 minutes or more..we all waited to eat to together so our hot dogs were cold. 

Then while eating the staff congregated at the middle table and all started fighting. They were rude to each other and one girl was yelling at the man to do his job. The guy was mad and said he always cleaned the bathrooms no one else did. Blah blah blah blah. It was all petty and childish and not the best reflection of the business. Couldn't that conversation happened in the kitchen not two seats away from us?"}
{"text":"Can you ever go wrong with jj's. The same greatness you get at the easy Blvd location, just more compact. Dogs and sides are still just as great. Only problem is I seem to be missing a certain pickled bar that i love from the other location"}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday and they were closed well before 7pm. Employees were sitting at the tables not doing anything, so you close early? I went there at 630, not good business practices."}
{"text":"Really expected more, even though just a hot dog place.  I expected a deli style type of \"deli\" dog... you know, like a good size, hearty hot dog with kickin' chili on a good quality bun.  What I got is literally what the babysitter would throw together when you were a kid. I think the dogs rolling around on those metal racks at 7-11 are better quality.  Gross.  JJs gives you a cheap, puny hot dog \"out of the bag\", slightly charred, on a room temperature bun (also basic \"out of the bag\") with crappy cheese and small squirt of canned chili. All that and make it a combo and they charge $9.  Wow"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. I got the Char Heel hot dog and it was delicious! Only four stars because the cheese fries are made with a mediocre cheese sauce- I'd recommend just getting plain fries."}
{"text":"Was a little nervous about JJ's being able to replicate the magic happening down at the East Blvd location as I anticipated (anxiously) the opening of their uptown location. But once I tried it and tried it again each time I was not left disappointed. 

2Â¢ - Keep an eye out for the weekly special since it usually is a tasty concoction.

Pro tip: get the 'char heel' and 'quarter hounder'"}
{"text":"Came in to pick up a bite on my way back to the Bechtler Museum to get my lovely bride and was greeted by a smiling face asking how can I be helped. I asked for the two hot dog special: one Chicago style, one New York, plus tots and a soda. I had to explain the New York reference (cooked kraut, deli mustard, and red onion) but they got it all put together in short order and off I went.
NY-style and Chicago-style were well executed, tots were hot to go, and the soda was cold and refreshing. It's good enough that I will be back.

Not saying anything, just saying: a Chicago dog is quite the production and self proclaimed hot dog snobs will fret and fuss and get their undies in a bunch about exactly what goes in (sport peppers, poppy seeds, neon green...), what stays out (ketchup, kraut, grilled...), and matters of conscience (pickle spear - cucumber wedge) but this is \"Chicago Style\" and JJ's has styled a good one for the Carolinas. When you start with a high quality hot-dog I end up with a high quality hot dog, JJ's does exactly like that."}
{"text":"Had the Italian sausage combo with tater tots. Very tasty with the right amount of spice for me. Service was friendly and quick at around 11:30 a.m.. I will try this again and get one of their custom hot dogs at time."}
{"text":"Went in around 7PM one night after working late and ordered two Chicago dogs with Onion rings. Dogs were served warm not hot, overdone with celery salt and the pickle/relish was watery. 

Onion straws were greasy and not appetizing at all. 

All this for about $12 or so. 

I used to live in Chicago and go to a place called Hippos. They served real Chicago dogs.

This place is a poor imitation at best. Save your money. The 7-Eleven hot dog is as good as these."}
{"text":"JJ's always makes me happy. 

I love that they have a new dog on the signature menu for this location: The Uptown Downtown (chili, bacon, beer cheese, onion, mustard). Yes please! I usually get two dogs and skip the side, but I do love their onion rings and the borracho beans. The handmade lemonade is also delicious. There is no pickle bar at this one. Sad face. 

On Tuesdays, dogs are just $2 after 3pm. Make sure to follow them on Instagram so you can see all the special creations they offer each week. 

Note: this location does not have a kids menu, so there is not a kids eat free night. You can check out the Dilworth and Ballantyne locations for that."}
{"text":"I've been to JJ's before at the Dilworth location so I'd figure I'd try the uptown location as well. As usual the food was really good. They have lots of choices and the staff was friendly. The only downside to this location is the size. It's pretty tight especially during the lunch rush. It's probably best to grab and go because seating is very limited at this location. The good thing is you can always sit at the park across the street on a nice day. I recommend this place for good hotdogs and lemonade!"}
{"text":"This was my first time into the Uptown JJ's location - YIKES! I love the JJ's location in Dilworth (and have given them 5 stars) but this location is struggling and had this been my first JJ's visit it would have also been my last. 

We arrived at 6 pm on a Sunday evening, knowing they close at 7. We thought an hour would be plenty of time to have a hotdog. We walked in and it appeared they were already closed for the night (because the drink station was broken down and there was no one working the counter), but they said they were open.

They were out of tea, various toppings, straws, and bottled water (but they don't offer tap water which is ABSURD in Charlotte). This location also does not have the speciality dogs that they have at the other locations and does not have the pickle bar which the other locations have. 

There is very limited seating - just bar top seating and then 3 tables that each sat 3. So you cannot dine in with a group.

I paid for a drink before learning they were out of tea, so when I then asked for a refund they were visibly annoyed. They also brought me the wrong food and again appeared annoyed when I informed them it was incorrect. 

I feel this location really weakens the JJ's name - from the lack of specialty dogs, to the lack of the pickle bar, to the poor service, to the lack of tap water, to the incorrect order. I live the Dilworth location, but I will never come to this location again.

FURTHER, I reached out to JJ's customer service team about my experience and they apologized but offered no solutions. They essentially just indicated that, yes this location was intended more for pickup orders."}
{"text":"Honestly, it's just an ordinary hotdog with some unique signiture topping combinations. Being from NYC, I appreciate a dog with just some relish and ketchup, but that's the same $3.99 as a signature dog. So in that sense I feel like I'm overpaying. The onion rings and fries are awesome. I felt very uncomfortable when paying with my credit card. The screen ONLY showed tips I could select. There was no clear option for not tipping. I had to awkwardly ask of how to not tip. It's not by any means a full serve restaurant. No one is bringing you your food. I don't tip when I go to KFC or McDonalds. If you do, that's awesome. I tip tipped employees that rely on tips and I'm a fairly generous tipper in that aspect. My low rating is not a reflection of the food, it's strictly being put in a very uncomfortable situation. Not cool. I'd rate the food 4 stars."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with JJ's. They produce a great product every time. Unfortunately, I think this location has some issues--it's a tight squeeze when you walk in and it can get uncomfortable when it gets busy. I wish they had a pickle bar like the East Blvd location too! But, at the end of the day--the dogs are why anyone should go there, and they are fantastic. I love the options and I'm so thrilled that JJ's is able to expand to multiple locations. If you're uptown, it's worth the stop!"}
