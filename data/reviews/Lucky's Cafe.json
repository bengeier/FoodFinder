{"text":"Breakfast for two adults, a 13 year old and a 4 year old = $100.  The food had some hits and misses.  The fact that my 4yr old wanted plain waffles without all of the toppings and we were still charged $16 AND we had to kick down more $$ for syrup \"it isn't included because of all of the toppings so you'll have to pay for it\" was just too much to stomach. My wife didn't want mushrooms in her omelet but we were told that was too difficult to pull off too.  How hard is it to simply not put a handful of mushrooms in an omelet? Service was weak as we had to ask our server twice for the GD syrup. 

I had the biscuits and gravy, a slam dunk choice...until my wife forced me to switch due to the all of the mushrooms in her omelet.

A smaller issue is that they don't present a check at the table, so you have no idea if they charged the correct amount.  After the meal, customers go to the register and a person behind the counter rings everything up based off of shorthand notes.  The total is simply a surprise.

This is the deal.  If you don't take your kids and don't expect Lucky's to accommodate changes from the menu you'll be ok.  Me?  I'm out."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with my mom. Nice atmosphere they were pretty busy but we didn't have to wait long for a table I have the mac and cheese which was good but really greasy wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy is my favorite dish here but everything I have tried has been very good. The wait is usually not the bad, and the service is good. They also have a great selection of pastries that are unique and delicious."}
{"text":"Such beautiful food and stunning presentation of a breakfast basic - granola. A real kick to actually see the chef in the garden getting herbs. Solid good espresso coffee. We chose this place because of it's name and the reviews - it was just what we needed after 2days of hotel grub. I wish every suburb in America had cafes like this!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. I love the homemade dishes. 

Our waitress, however, was rude and inattentive. She forgot to bring us extra dishes and napkins and disappeared for a long stretch."}
{"text":"I stop by once, maybe twice a week for a cup of coffee.  A medium cup of coffee used to be $1.90 but now it's $2.75.  That is such a rip off for a cup of coffee and quite a price increase!  Guess I'll be finding a new coffee shop.  Now everything is this restaurant is overpriced."}
{"text":"I'm pretty excited to concur in the 5 star rating for this place.

I went a few years ago, and was not impressed.  I'd heard the hype, but what I didn't realize was that all the hype was for brunch, and brunch was only served on the weekend.  So even though I was there at breakfast time, I ended up getting a basic deli sandwich.

Fast forward to now.  Back in Cleveland, I thought I should give it another proper shot.  Went on a Sunday, around noon, which is high time.  The place was packed, but we managed to get parking pretty close out front.  And because we were willing to sit at the little table in the front, near the sofas, we didn't have to wait at all to be seated.  I didn't think the crowds were a negative, even though they were standing all around us in the front.  I wanted to vacate when we were all finished, to help them out, but I didn't feel pressured to scarf it down or anything. 

If you do have to wait, just have a cup of coffee and chill out.  I got a massive vanilla latte and it was like silk.  Lovely indulgence at Sunday brunch.

I ordered the Shipwreck and the pecan-encrusted bacon, as they are all the rage.  Was not disappointed at all.  It's hard to describe what makes the Shipwreck so good, since it's just the standard brunch combo of eggs, potatoes, veggies and cheese.  But this is no omelet.  Nor is it hash browns.  It's just a skillet concoction that somehow has the perfect balance of all ingredients.  I asked for ketchup as I usually eat it with eggs and hash browns, but absolutely no need.  Serving size is ample; I had the second half for Monday breakfast, which made Monday morning at work much more bearable.  The toast that comes with the Shipwreck is drenched in butter; delicious, but probably deadly.  I'll ask for it without next time.  Also don't believe there's any fruit on the side, it's like one slice of strawberry and one of pineapple.  Pecan crust on bacon was fantastic, and the perfect sweet/salty combo.   I wish the bacon were a bit crispier, but it was darn close to perfect.  Tasted the gingerbread waffles which were also good.  Just don't order the sausage.  Don't do it.  I have no clue why the sausage is the only bad thing, maybe it's just overlooked.  But the patties are just bland and dry.  Maybe they are healthy so there is no fat?  But I LOVE sausage and eat chicken sausage all the time, so I am not really buying such excuses.  But with all the other good stuff at Lucky's, you won't miss the sausage.  Just get more bacon!"}
{"text":"Quick version: great coffee, good food, shitty attitudes.

We recently enjoyed Lucky's brunch. The coffee was seriously delicious and you could tell they were well-pulled espresso shots. The food was pretty good. We tried the shipwreck (eggs, cheese, potatoes, bacon, all combined) served with toast, the hummus dish (fresh made pita chips), the biscuits, all the stand-bys. The part of the meal that left our whole table unsatisfied was the service. 

I pulled a piece of parchment paper out of my eggs and showed the waiter to which he didn't even blink. No apology or anything. I'm not the type of person who makes a big deal out of little stuff, I've worked in a kitchen but all he said was \"Oh\". 

The barista and waiters were very dismissive and un-apologetic. Serving cold coffee only after being waved down three times, bringing 1 measly ramikan of jam for 6 people to share, snapping things at us like \"Theres only one of me\". Thats fine, we're being patient just give us some attention: we're overpaying for your time."}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast spots in Cleveland. If you go there on the weekend be prepared to wait, but rest assured, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Food: good, homecooked, not greasy, good flavor, limited menu.

Waffles: oddly cake-y (like dessert) with delicious strawberry rhubarb sauce (seriously eat with a spoon) and creamy whip cream.
Shipwreck Eggs: yum, like I'd make at home, very little grease, yummy vegetables like green beans with nice fruit side.

Atmosphere: this is a coffee shop with a bunch of tables that are very close together and a big touch of \"coffee shop coolness\" in the decor as in painted vinyl diner chairs with paint a little peeling off and not matching the other tables with a real old fashioned (but new) linoleum floor in funky new almost aluminum finish and curved lines. While we didn't sit on the patio those picnic tables looked great for a perfect weather day.

Service: very nice and northeast ohio friendly with freckles and ponytales but \"cool.\"

This would have been 4 stars except I went with my children who had very specific ideas of what they wanted and these items were not only not on the limited menu (which was beautiful, elegant  and delicious but missing my small ones' desired entrees) but the server/kitchen had no interest in making modifications to the menu. Not that I expect everyone to match my little ones' mental picture of the best breakfast ever but ... no side of bacon? no pancakes? no syrup except added to an already $14 waffle that would have made it $18 (yep plus $4 for syrup)? no plain noodles  because they didn't know how to charge for it? and some discomfort with putting the fruit sauce on the side for the waffle? Well okay but there needs to be flexibility in the menu to get four stars. 

Note - yes this is expensive for breakfast fare but the quality is unquestioned and much better for you than somewhere that is likely to charge a lot less and clog every last artery.

Another note - free parking on the street, easy to find! Wow. This was a Tuesday just before noon. Seating for 3 after a very short wait."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch.  I have ate here a couple of times now and the food has been great everytime.  I order the rubean and have never been disappointed.  I just wish we had a restaurant like luckys cafe' were I live Wich  is about 3 hours west of Cleveland."}
{"text":"Bleh. Was my meal edible? Yeah, but that is the extent of it.  I ordered a steak sandwich on 'jalepeno cheese bread\". Sounds yummy, doesn't it? Well instead of tender sliced steak, it was a hunk of dry, tough steak, one giant piece, slapped on a piece of bread. The bread didn't have a jalepeno in sight, it was just a lousy supermarket roll with some shredded cheese melted (burned) on top. Yuck. Very nice service though, the waitress was like a sweet grandma who wanted you to feel right at home."}
{"text":"Was looking for good place for brunch while we were in Cleveland for the weekend. The bellman at the hotel recommended Lucky's, said they had the best brunch in the area. He did say that parking is limited, but there was on street parking. There was a short (25) minute wait before we were seated,but we were not in any hurry so we waited. I am glad we did, the food was worth the wait
 I ordered  the biscuits and gravy and my wife had the pumpkin french toast, a side of bacon. The food came out fairly quickly and tasted amazing. The prices are a little steep, with our bill coming to over $50 with tip. However I always say you must try enjoy yourself when  you can, and hangout out on a Sunday with my wife is priceless."}
{"text":"Came here on vacation with friends. All 6 of us loved loved loved it! I will eat here every time I'm in the area. Awesome! Friendly! Fresh food! Great drinks!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has so many good reviews.  Yes it is local, which is great but their menu is limited.  They don't allow any changes or deviations from the menu and when I asked I was sternly told they don't do that because everything is freshly made. If it's freshly made then why can't they adjust the ingredients, like my request, which was to omit bacon from the meal???  On a busy weekend morning you will likely spend 10 minutes driving around looking for a parking spot because there is no private parking.  And it was also extremely crowded and the tables are so tightly packed in that you could eat from your neighbor's plate not to mention the male host was rude.  Needless to say, we left and went to Grumpy's down the street."}
{"text":"I was excited to try out Lucky's as I love to support organic, local food and loved the fact that they have an actual garden on site where they grow produce. I was fully expecting to be a huge fan, but sadly that was not the case. First off, our waitress was fairly off-putting. She wasn't overtly rude, but she wasn't polite either. I thought she had a bad attitude straight-away, but figured that she could be having a bad day or just be a bad apple in the bunch. I was still ready to have an awesome meal. Looking at the menu, I found it to be pricier than I was expecting, but sometimes supporting local & organic food comes with a price tag, so I was still on board. 

However, when it came time to place our order things went downhill FAST. My partner and I both asked for very simple changes to the items we wanted - nothing fancy or complicated - and they flat-out refused. I asked for a shipwreck with no bacon, but was told no because the bacon and eggs were pre-mixed together. Yet there are other items on the menu with plain scrambled eggs, so why it should be so hard to break open a couple of fresh eggs to scramble is beyond me. My partner tried to order a sandwich and asked that they put onion on it instead of zucchini and was also told no. The waitress went off to ask the kitchen because she \"wasn't sure\" if they would be willing to do it. When she came back and said no I asked a couple of questions to try to understand why they wouldn't accommodate such simple requests and got a bunch of nonsense that seemed to come down to the fact that whoever was in the back cooking just didn't feel like it that day because \"sometimes\" they could do it but now wasn't one of those times and she could give no reason as to why that was. I kept looking at the menu and my partner tried to ask if they would make some different substitution for her (honestly can't remember what she asked for as I was pretty annoyed at that point) and she was again told no. That was the final no for us.

Now, this was on a weekday and was NOT during a peak time, so it's not like they were slammed. There was no wait to be seated and they had more than enough staff on hand.  Considering that menu items start at $14, I would expect that they could accommodate reasonable requests. I mean, this isn't Denny's. And for a place that has a reputation as being vegetarian-friendly to refuse to accommodate the request to make something without bacon because it would take them two extra minutes to break open some new eggs? Seems pretty ridiculous to me. We decided to leave and take our business elsewhere, and I'm quite glad we did as we had a much better experience there. 

There are plenty of other amazing local restaurants with delicious local & organic food and friendly staff, where they are more concerned with providing good customer service and less concerned with being hip and trendy. Perhaps this place has gotten so popular that they no longer feel they have to worry about customer service? It was obvious that the staff could not have cared less when we decided to go elsewhere. I really wanted to be able to support this business, but in the end I will not be going back there again."}
{"text":"Love it, but wish they were gluten-free (the only reason I'm holding back a star). I've been a Clevelander since 2007, and was diagnosed with Celiac Disease in 2012; that leaves 5 lovely years as a frequent patron of Lucky's, home of the most delicious macaroni and cheese I've ever tasted / devoured / bemoaned as both too much and not enough for hours later. 

No, they don't serve standard diner food; nor is the fare anything you'd describe as greasy-spoon. That caveat notwithstanding, Lucky's manages to make organic, locally-sourced and downright healthy Lunch/Brunch fare accessible in the extreme. Their Sunshine 'Cocktail' (Pellegrino Aranciata mixed with OJ and ice) is a delightful non-alcoholic mimosa, and the Shipwreck breakfast, though not my favorite, was a repeat performance. 

These guys are masters of their crafts, do quick and handy work, and while I don't expect them to mess with the formula or go to the time and expense of conversion, dear lord if they ever decide to add a gluten-free menu, or send me the recipe for the sauce that makes their mac-and-cheese, I will die a happy, if morbidly obese, woman."}
{"text":"I just moved to Cleveland, and was looking for a nice \"non chain\" breakfast place that reminded me of home back in Georgia, which has a lot of hearty food, with great hospitality. Haven't seen much yet. But I'm very glad I ran across Lucky's.  The food was Great. Good service. I thought the garden was very cute. Impressed by the fact they use their own produce. 

The wait was long, I waited about an hour. I totally understand why, everyone wants to eat here. Lol. But it was well worth It. 

I had the biscuits and gravy. It was perfect. 

Highly recommended. :D"}
{"text":"The food was ok but I was early and my friend was late so the host literally said in front of crowd of people: \"still waiting? Guy stood you up?\" 

There was no accommodation for anything on the menu. Like we couldn't order over easy eggs on the side. My salad was romaine drenched in mayo w few cubes of beets."}
{"text":"As a visitor in Cleveland, I was excited to meet with my friend at a local organic cafe for breakfast. I was hoping for a better experience, unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed.

I was running late and they would not seat my friend and proceeded flask loudly if she had gotten stood up! Haha not so appropriate

I ordered the waffles which   were pretty good, came with caramel iced apples and cinnamon flavored. I asked for a side of eggs over easy, which I was told could not be done; they only made them scrambled :/. 

No substitution are accommodated, if that's An issue for you."}
{"text":"Visited here for lunch after much hype from friends, magazines and TV.

I was pleased.  Quality foods, at average to above average prices. $13.75 (February, 2010) for their Reuben sandwich.

The server went on and on about how *everything* was house made and locally produced, etc...yet found no homemade chips and no local beverage selections, outside of the house coffees, and of course Cleveland's tap water.


My only real negative, and big pet peeve is that the sandwich was served with a pickle, and you get that nasty pickle juice taste on things like chips and the sandwich itself.  Of course the menu doesn't say it comes with pickle, that's left to chance."}
{"text":"I went to Lucky's Café today for breakfast with a friend.  We didn't make reservations (it was Mother's Day), so we had a 10 minute wait for a table for two, which was not a bad wait at all.

Our server was very energetic, and exuded happiness while she greeted us and described all of today's specials on the menu.  She did a great job verbally describing the specials.  I know, because, as she was reciting from memory, I was actually reading the \"special menu,\" and she described all of the items on the long menu in order!

I ordered the Breakfast Burritos - scrambled eggs wrapped in flour tortillas, covered in what tasted like a mole (pronounced \"mole - aay\") sauce.  This meal came with Lucky's Café hash browns, which are big diced potatoes with the skins on them. The meal was very tasty and filling.

Our server came by often to see if we needed anything.

We were lucky to sit inside the restaurant, which, in my opinion, is way too small for such a popular place.  This time of year, there are tables set up outside, some under covering that provided some shade, and other tables directly in the sun.  The addition of these outdoor tables easily doubled the amount of total seats.

Why only four stars?  Two reasons:  This place is too crowded, and I think the prices are a little high.  Yes, this is a very popular Tremont restaurant which serves fresh food, most of which is raised/grown in Ohio.  When I stated that this is crowded, I meant that there isn't much room to walk through the indoor dining area.  There were a couple of times that my chair got bumped from behind by someone walking by, and I also had to make sure that no plates or glasses were too close to the edge of the table, because other peoples' behinds maneuvering between the tables could easily knock objects off the table."}
{"text":"Might have a long wait but brunch here was really good. Hands down one of the best Mac and cheeses I've ever tasted and they have really good coffee options too. Try it if you're in the area!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast buffet w/ 3 other hungry college girlfriends. For about $10 each. 

I loved the booths, very comfty and spacy. 

Concierge in the lobby were great!

...it's inconvenient to get to considering it's not center-strip, but I still love breakfast food, esp when it's hot and buffet-style!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot for farm to table food. They have a garden on the property where they harvest a lot of their ingredients. Ask for the house made hot sauce. Not too spicy and very flavorful. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"First meal on a trip to Cleveland and it was amazing!! Very friendly staff, small comfy feel, and a very unique menu. Food was absolutely delicious! They also have a bakery counter at the front where they sell baked goods that have been all made with local ingredients. Perfect brush spot!"}
{"text":"I dined at this lovely little restaurant because of the many great reviews here on yelp and I totally see what everyone is raving about!!

I arrived on a Saturday morning around 9ish just before the rush.  The staff was very friendly and they had a nice display case of desserts and home made granola.  I ordered the shipwreck and a dark roast coffee.  The food was great and I was full before finishing the meal so I took the rest to go.

Will definitely return the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Bright my husband here for birthday brunch. We came around ten am on a Saturday and it was hopping.  If I came again, I would probably come between eight and nine when it might be a bit quieter. 

Despite them being support busy, service was great. Someone stopped to check in on us every five to ten minutes which was sweet.  

Beardyman ordered a French press which was way more coffee than he thought.  He said it was pretty good coffee.  I drank water from a large bottle placed on the table. 

The food is like eating breakfast at Beardyman's family farm.  Everything is made from scratch, local ingredients, cooked in real butter and smothered in cream and house made hot sauce.  The food tastes like back home, a little rustic, rich, and super delicious. 

I got the omelette.  It came with hash browns. They were soft and buttery and perfect.  Inside the omelette was a lot of delicious spinach, mushrooms, zuchini, and cheddar cheese.  None of the veggies were either dry or slimy. Beardyman got the biscuits. So much food, so decadent. So delicious. Perfectly creamy and savory.  Yum

10 for 10 will do again."}
{"text":"I have been coming here off and on for some years and it's always been decent but it seems like in recent years they have stepped their food game way up. Now it's not just decent but grrrrrreat!  And this is coming from someone (me) who generally isn't big on \"going out for brunch\" (always crowds, noisy, I can make pancakes at home, etc.) and thinks bacon belongs in two crisp little strips next to scrambled eggs on a breakfast plate once a month or so rather than chocolate dipped, on everything, every day. Did I mention that the pecan crusted bacon here is just about the best thing ever next to kittens?  That the tortilla soup is better than most Mexican restaurants?  The reuben is completely scratch made and has a sauce that doesn't taste like any Russian dressing I'm familiar with but man was it good, even if its name should maybe be Rudolph rather than Reuben.  They have a very impressive pastry case as well. The icing on the cake is the super-hip servers who look like they would give you the Portlandia thousand-yard bored stare but are actually really nice, engaging, helpful, and interested in serving you.  

Now yes it is small and crowded. Your odds of getting a table are much better if you show up in ones and twos rather than fives and sixes (or just go on a weekday when everyone else is at work).  And the menu is a bit changeable (for example, they have different things on the weekend than they do the rest of the week). So I recommend looking at the menu on the web and on the Facebook before you go down there, and having a backup choice picked out if they don't happen to have the mac and cheese that day or whatever.  This shouldn't be hard as it's all good stuff.  Also, don't plan on asking for a lot of substitutions - this isn't your local diner. But other than that, by all means, go to Lucky's.  And eat some bacon.  Mmmm, bacon."}
{"text":"We went for Sunday brunch 2/26/12.  The mac and cheese was incredible, my wife had the tuna melt, which was on special and loved it.  My sister thoroughly enjoyed the Shipwreck, while my brother-in-law devoured the biscuits.
The service was outstanding.  We look forward to going back to Lucky's Cafe the next time we are in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The food is better than average, but I didn't find it amazing like many people had told me.  I would give the place 4 stars for their food alone, but I am knocking it down to 3 because they seem to be too high on themselves with the whole no substitutions and high prices things."}
{"text":"We thought the food was wonderful !!  The food was prepared on site... Bread, jam, etc... We loved it !"}
{"text":"Breakfast was magnificent!!! Ratatouille omelette, biscuits and gravy, pecan bacon!!! Fabulous coffee!!  Great employees!  Saw it on Guy Fieri's show and added a day onto our trip to visit family in the Midwest to try Lucky's and go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!  My advice- do it too!!!  Go early!!!  They open at eight on Sundays but only for coffee (website could be a bit more understandable here) then they start serving at nine.  We hung out and read the paper...  Thank goodness!  They were hopping by the time we placidly sailed away!  Is it too expensive?  NO. These weren't just plain ol' eggs.  There was a quality equal to a very fine dinner!  We have discussed making the same diversion each time we cross country.  Wait staff inordinately fond of facial piercings and neck tattoos, but were very sweet."}
{"text":"Great place held back by inflexibility.

The charming atmosphere of the outdoor dining area couldn't bear the weight of the limited and inflexible menu served by a staff that made me feel as if I'd never had brunch outside of a chain restaurant and said as much; \"You know this isn't Bob Evans.\"

Lucky's Cafe reminded me of places I've been in Maine with casual picnic tables in the midst of a garden. Our server started out charming and witty, but things took a turn when I wanted to order a dish called the Shipwreck without bacon. She asked the manager and the answer was \"no\". I then asked if I could have a side of scrambled eggs with an order of pancakes. Again the answer was \"no\" and the excuse was the small kitchen didn't allow them the luxury of substitutions. Neither was a substitution.

My brunch companions thought the food was good, but overpriced. The blueberry smoothies were exceptionally good, but not worth it at $5.95 each. 

I doubt I'll return to Lucky's when there are so many other great breakfast places nearby (Grumpie's, West Side Market Cafe) where side orders are commonplace and the service is better."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Mac and cheese. REALLY enjoyed the Reuben sandwich. 

Not cheap but fresh ingredients and large portions do justify the investment. 

Looking forward to repeat appearance next time in Cleveland."}
{"text":"First let me say the service was fantastic. I sat outside with my dog and the server brought my dog water. The meal was even better. I had the warm spinach salad with egg. I was shocked at how great it was. I also tried the turkey sandwich. The cupcakes were good but a little dry."}
{"text":"I stopped in on a weekday after the the breakfast rush and the place was empty.  There was a server talking to some dude who may or may not have worked there.  I asked if I could sit anywhere (literally NO OTHER CUSTOMERS BUT ME) and the server distractedly said, \"uh... what?...OK... I guess\".

I sat down and watched my server (who was about 10 feet away) do NOTHING to acknowledge me.  She just continued her conversation with some dude.  No menu, no water, nothing.  After 5 minutes I asked the server if they were, in fact, open for business.  Without answering me, she brought over a menu then went back to her conversation with the dude.

After another 5 minutes of being ignored, I walked over to the server, handed her my menu and said, \"no thank you.\"  As I went toward the door, the dude asked, \"don't you want anything?\"

I just smiled and said, \"obviously not\".  

The food MAY be outstanding, but I'll never know."}
{"text":"After shooting the MAC tournament we needed some good food for the long drive home. This was a excellent choice! The coffee was great and this was one of the best breakfasts I've had! Service was prompt and friendly. I highly recommend this establishment! I got the shipwreck and couldn't finish it WOW! We got there early, and I'm sure it fills up quick due to the size of the restaurant. But still, all in all great food!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty great. We came with a group of 6 visiting Cleveland from out of town. We had some not so great experiences with the downtown restaurants and decided to head over to Tremont for our last meal. 

We were able to sit outside on a picnic table near their vegetable planters. I thought that it was much nicer than sitting inside, which seemed kind of cramped. We had great service throughout the meal. The entire staff seemed very personable and the owner even took some time to speak to us. 

We each ordered a different entree and everyone seemed to enjoy what they had ordered. I had a blueberry-strawberry-banana smoothie, the breakfast burritos, and an order of pecan bacon. Everything was delicious, particularly the bacon. 

I think the only downside is the price. Breakfast was pretty expensive. They do basically make everything from scratch, so it is justified. Overall, I will definitely go back to this place next time I'm near Cleveland."}
{"text":"Good but the menu hasn't been changed up for years. They need to freshen it up!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  The reuben sandwich is the best I ever tasted!   The mac and cheese was also crazy good.  Service was awesome. 

Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I have been to Lucky's Cafe a few times now and it really has been just as good as the first time.  They make a great effort to use products from Ohio and some neighboring states and their biscuits are made with real butter.  Staff is very friendly and I've never felt rushed.

It's a small space and can be a bit noisy, but they've done the best they can with their space.  Oh, and the artwork I've seen on their walls has been great. And it's for sale.

Positives: Portions are largs.  Food is seasoned well and not oversalted. Food is the real deal. You can bring home a piece of art.

Negatives: Brunch can end up costing a few hundred bucks if you do buy some art."}
{"text":"Delicious farm-to-table food. Excellent selection of pastry and baked goods. Coffee and tes selections made to order. Excellent host and wait staff. Wonderful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Another favorite Cleveland restaurant. Try the Shipwreck, Tomato Soup & Grilled Cheese, and for heaven's sake, the Mac & Cheese!"}
{"text":"At this moment, this place is my favorite place in the Greater Cleveland area for brunch. I don't say this much but it is definitely just one of those places where you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. When it is busy there is very much a wait to get a table. The wait is just a testament to the popular following this shining Tremont jewel is as a serious brunch destination for Cleveland."}
{"text":"Sadly, I have never eaten here, but I think this is a great place to get coffee. It's so nice and quiet in the late afternoons, and uncrowded. The coffee drinks are tasty too."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots. Total hipster atmosphere. I would recommend either the shipwreck if you are hungry or the waffles. The house coffee taste like crap. I haven't had any of the mix coffee drinks so therefore I don't have a comment on them. Plan to get there early or you will be waiting forever for a seat. Avoid the weekends like the plague 

Happy eatting"}
{"text":"The food here is incredible!!!
I had the grilled cheese of the day (to die for!) with tomato soup (also delicious!)
My boyfriend had the curried tofu and the most amazing mocha we've ever tasted.
(yes, I stole some) ;)

The staff was super awesome! Great service and really nice people.

Love the atmosphere as well - and free parking is a bonus!

If I ever go back to Cleveland, I will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I read the reviews about this place and decided to have breakfast here. Mostly the pecan bacon got my attention.
I was a little nervous as my gps took me thru some questionable areas.
The place is small and nice. Parking could be an issue. 
But, I will make trip again next time in Cleveland. 
The bacon was to die for. I had the shipwreck which I could not finish. And I'm a big eater.
Staff was excellent.
Gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent grilled cheese & tomato bisque. Not a bad thing on the menu at Lucky's.

Parking can be a bit hairy but it's worth it for a great breakfast, brunch or lunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic! I love that all the ingredients are fresh and homegrown or local. The wait can be a long one but I love the bustle of it! The food and enjoyment is worth the wait if you have time. Grab your coffee and people watch!"}
{"text":"DONT BLAME THE SERVERS!! Ok this is coming from the other side-a person unlucky enough to have had worked for this hell hole., and who has never worked for such a 'bich' of a owner in MY LIFE! The sucky service is NOT the fault of the servers its the OWNER- HEATHER's overbearing control freak rules that make this place $HIT! She is a literal SLAVE driver and works the hell out of everyone, and doesnt even let the servers have thier hard earned tips. SHes so controlling she has to take our tips too-probably to help pay the hourly employees!   Its the owner HEATHER who makes a big HUGE DEAL for  the server to tell you an embarrassing elaborate 10 minute story about the food where it comes from and so on, whether your ready to order or not. She thinks it helps justify paying $16 for a omelete.Got to give it to her though, the food is amazing, you can tell by looking AT HER lol!) The place is tiny so tiny and the kitchen is the size of a domestic one (since the place is originally a HOUSE!) so the owner HEATHER makes the servers embarrissinly tell tables no substitutions as to not bother her prized kitchen crew of three little slaves-that cant keep up with the #guests and hurt the servers money even more! HEATHER says she doesnt care what people think, \" dont like it, they can leave and not come back\" Thats how she is, its her way and her way only, whether its irrational or not. I got yelled at for telling a table HER POLICY of no substitutions and understandably the guests were pissed(so embarrassing telling people no to this no to that btw, and so out of the ordinary) THE OWNER HEATHER said I should have atleast walked around the room and pretended I asked the kitchen for the substitute-even though the answer would still be NO! Servers have no control over drinks as the Barista has to make all drinks and we have to share all tips with them, and they are a snooty bunch too. Another thing I have never saw before at any other business- THE OWNER wants food ..i mean \"works of art\" to go out as soon as its ready even if it means everyone else at the table is waiting 10-15mins for thiers-also looks bad on the server. I could go on and on, but if you think its a bitch eating at LUCKYS then imagine working there! Go on the weekends when HEATHER the OWNER is there and tell her your negative feedback, because she likes to sit the servers down after ever shift and go over what WE did WRONG!! ITS HER THAT NEEDS REVIEWING! But the mac and cheese and reuben are amazing, but will cost you a 20 dollar bill and about 2hours of your time:)"}
{"text":"Awesome tea and coffee drinks. Definitely try the papa mocha drink! Get the shipwreck if you scrambled eggs!"}
{"text":"hate the wait but love love love the food, peach stuffed french toast....yum.  The biscuit and gravy rocks, worth the wait if u have no where to be."}
{"text":"Service is horrible. Only one person takes orders and don't ask anyone else for help because only the captain can take the order

Food is pretty good but kids will not like it

No coffee refills and no one came over to ever help.  Better choices down the street and worth the wait at grumpys

It could easy be better with a slight change to who takes orders and is responsible for a table.  

Regarding the food, the toast is made well in advance so it is hard as a rock. 
  Bacon should be crispy but is not. Rest is the food is pretty good very few choices to pick from.


Severs can make a difference when pricey.  Our server was bad and it reflects on the whole place because she really did not seem to care"}
{"text":"Maybe it was just the day but we did not have a good experience at Lucky's. To be specific - poor service (our server never came to the table after taking our order), food was salty, coffee tasted old & once getting our food, we had to track down our server to ask for water & condiments. This was definitely the last time we'll be coming here."}
{"text":"Simply best Rubin ever. 

The pecan bacon leaves you speechless. 

Service was good. Bathrooms clean and modern. An overall good dining experience"}
{"text":"My family had great food and it was fresh and homemade.  I love the concept of \"farm to table\" and using local food.  We had corned beef hash, omelets, biscuits and gravy and desserts that are to die for.  The staff we interacted with was very knowledgeable and friendly.    
My family will be returning!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast. The pecan bacon is fantastic, its a must when eating here. I like all the fresh local ingredients and the staff is really good. Negatives would be that its a little pricey for breakfast, and the hours are not the greatest. This place is definately worth the trip."}
{"text":"While in Cleveland for a weekend, my wife and I decided to check out Lucky's. Are we ever glad we did... We saw Lucky's on Diners, drives ins and Dives and had to go. We had the biscuits and gravy and the vanilla bean waffles. It was, without a doubt the best breakfast I have ever had. 

We got there rather early on a Sunday morning, about 9:00 and were promptly seated. By the time we left there were about 5-6 tables waiting to be seated, I would suggest getting there early if you do not want to wait. However it there is a wait, it is well worth it. 

If I ever find myself back in Cleveland, you can bet I will be going back to Lucky's...."}
{"text":"I went here with my family and it was a good experience. Very good food, coffee, and atmosphere. Only negative was when we were leaving, one of the employee checking us out got frustrated we had to go items and was letting it out on us by raising her voice and slamming pens and such down. Again though, great food, I got the oatmeal, my wife and mom got the shipwreck and brother got the omelette."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast with a friend during the week. Everything is fresh, local, and organic. The place has a very cozy coffee shop feel. The whole area is up and coming and this place is a great place to stop for breakfast/lunch or to get coffee and an amazing pastry. I would definitely recommend.

*Note: They are not open for dinner!"}
{"text":"I don't give this restaurant even one star; they don't desrve it for the following reasons:
1. Our server Edward W did not show any respect to us when we asked him if they can serve us omlet eggs and pancakes without sticking to the restaurant menu. He answered us that thier menu is \"fixed\" and we should order exactly as per the menu!
2. Having said that we ordered the following:
    -Grilled turkey sandwitch
    -Waffles
    -Shipwreck \"without bacon\"
3. We emphasized to have \"no bacon\" and in case they can't do that then to cancell the order of Shipwreck. Edward told us that he is not sure whether they can do that and he promised to check for us.
4. A lady, apparently from the kitchen, brought our orders to the table and she said \"your shipwreck order withiut bacon\". However, when we started eating, we found many pieces of \"bacon\"!
5. When Edward brought our check for signature he asked us if every thing was \"OK\", I answered \"NO\"! And I showed him the pieces of bacon! Edward pretended that he was upset by saying \"I am so upset\"!
6. Edawrd nor the lady did applogize for what happened!
7.Nevertheless I left them a \"gratitude\"!!!

In summary we don't recommend this restaurant to any one!!!"}
{"text":"I visited Lucky's Cafe once years ago.  For some reason, it didn't leave a strong impression.  I gave in to the hype and returned for brunch today as a part of my mini \"farewell to Cleveland by eating it\" tour.

The menu was brief - no lengthy list of eggs-meat-starch permutations offered at typical brunch locales.  Because of the dearth of selection on the menu (curiously there was an extended weekend-only brunch menu) plus the higher than diner prices (and charge for coffee refills), my girlfriend acted out and threatened to leave.

Luckily we stayed and were delighted with the food.  I had the biscuits - topped with eggs smothered with lots of gravy as they should be, with a sprinkle of green onions.  The flavor was great, and the texture with everything together was perfect.  My girlfriend had the waffles - stacked with strawberries and cream - rich and sweet but not too desserty, also perfect.

If you have some time and are prepared to spend $15-20 for brunch, I would highly recommend Lucky's.  If you're visiting from out of town, you may wish to check out some of the other restaurants around Tremont, or take a couple of minutes to walk around the neighborhood, with its cafes and galleries scattered among the residents - dads walking dogs with kids and old couples sitting on the porch.  I'm glad it will be one of my final memories of Cleveland, OH."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for prime rib dinner in las vegas. The prime rib here are the best you can get anywhere in the world, especially given the price you pay, $9.99 after midnight, $10.99 5-8pm. The portion is always generous. The meat is always juicy. And, best of all, if you ask for rare, they give it to you rare!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite places for breakfast/brunch in Cleveland. They often have new foods on their menu but always maintain their classics. They have their own garden at the back of their patio. Usually quite a wait on the weekend, but worth it!"}
{"text":"The Sandwich Of Turkey and great selection of coffee drinks always lure me back in. The mac and cheese and high quality ingredients along with super friendly and efficient service completely justify their higher than average prices. There's always a good go-to and a sprinkling of fun seasonal items to try. This is a small and trendy place, so arrive early for a seat, especially for brunch. Expect a wait and a small area in which to do so."}
{"text":"Not your cheapest option for brunch, but you won't regret it. The food here is really special, from the menu items to their desert case. The menu is small but it has enough variety that most people will be happy, even if you happen to be dining with a vegetarian or vegan. Tables are small and it can be hard to fit a big group in, but if you're only dining with one other person, it's perfect."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch!   I heard very good things about this place from a foodie friend so when I was in town visiting family for Easter I made my family go.  I was told the weekend brunch wait time can be long so we made sure to get there early.  My father was skeptical that a breakfast could be so good he had to get up at 8 on a Saturday but when we left he said it was true. 

A waiter stated that the best thing on the menu that is always overlooked is the oatmeal....wow....all I can say is wow.  I mean you'd think how can one oatmeal be any better than another, but it was!   The poached eggs that accompanied the oatmeal were equally amazing.   The oatmeal has winter fruit and a brulee'd sugar on top so it has this wonderful sweet shell to crack through.  They serve it with a side of I believe buttermilk to help counteract the sweetness.  I just can't stop raving about how the balance of crunchy sugar and creamy oatmeal went together.  The eggs are poached in cream with Parmesan and fresh spinach and served with toast. 

We all made a deal that we'd get different stuff so we could try each others food.  Our table had the biscuits, omelet, shipwreck, waffles, and we got a side of the pecan crusted bacon to share.  Everything was so delicious, everyone was very happy with their food. 

Yes the food costs more than a Denny's or Eat n Park brunch, but the quality is so much better.  You can't get local- small farm fresh food for the same price as over processed factory crap.  

And as satisfied and full as we were, it didn't stop us from hitting up Lilly's Chocolates next door which will get it's own review :)

I've been dreaming about that oatmeal every since it was that good!"}
{"text":"The Gingerbread waffle was great. Nice place to eat in with family or friends. I would definitely go back sometime soon. The waiter was very helpful and and nice as well."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: hip little cafe/restaurant scene with outdoor seating.

Service: friendly and knowledgeable.

Food: Everything is from local farms...ok awesome. The food looks super good and has a lot of thought into it......oh awesome! But its 13 bucks for waffles......oh....well then. 

Came here for breakfast with my fiance and then saw the prices. It looked great and probably would taste great, but no waffles are worth 13 dollars. Ended up getting a 4 dollar apple pie slice (tasted good) and she got a very dry muffin for a few dollars. 

We are by no means poor, but even if those waffles rubbed my feet and were filled with bacon....they can't be worth 13 dollars. You can buy farm fresh local produce and food for much less elsewhere. The price was the deal breaker for us. 


Conclusion: Decent, but overpriced.  Would not come back. Other reviews talk about how good the food is. Well if you think it's good enough for the price, then go! 

But my Jeep is thirsty. $13 = 3 gallons of refined petroleum product that took a great amount of technology and time to produce..............or waffles. You decide."}
{"text":"I'd heard from a few people that this was THE place for brunch so I was excited when I finally had a chance to go.  I like that they've got a garden and all of that local food stuff.  I'm hoping that will become less of a unique feature and we'll see other places adopt a similar practice.  There was a line outside so we signed up for a table and waited with a few other folks (maybe in warmer weather the outdoor seating makes for less of a wait?) which was kind of what I expected to do.  For some reason that seems to be the norm for brunch places.

I didn't do research before going because of how much my boyfriend loves the place- he'd been wanting to take me for some time.  I didn't see the menu before arrival.  Maybe some people are super into the items they serve- me, not that much.  Some of the items looked like they might be tasty but had one or two things that I'd have asked them to hold.  Since that wasn't an option I felt a little more limited than I'd have liked.  I'm not what people would call picky when it comes to food.  I can usually find something anywhere I go that I really, really like.  I'm the person in a group that might have a craving for something or another and make a suggestion based on that, but; I'm not the person that says no to a certain kind of food or restaurant.

I think most people could find something on the menu that they would like.  They have mac n cheese for goodness sake!  Who doesn't like that (except maybe my friend who will not eat cheese)?  I couldn't decide between the waffles and the mac n cheese- it sounded really really good!!!  Both sounded really, really good!!  The folks at the next table were chowing down on the mac n cheese and I decided to go with that.  The portion was huge, too.  

The cheese combination was great- it wasn't your typical mac n cheese for sure.  Actually it wasn't macaroni (of course I can't remember which sort of pasta it was) which I appreciated since macaroni itself can be less exciting.  It came with a side of their own applesauce, also.  So the flavor was great, the pasta perfect- it was SALTY!!!  Usually I'm not someone who finds something too salty.  My old coworkers would say, \"oh that is too salty,\" and I'd think that it wasn't something I'd even identify as being salty- never mind too salty!  This stuff was SALTY.  SALTY!!!!  It was SALTY!!!!!!  It was also rather oily.  I'm from the south and we fry near about everything so when I say oily (and salty) take it from me as an expert.  

The prices were also a bit more than I'd say is ok as well.  Maybe I'll have a different experience next go around?"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had! I am in the industry and the way we were treated by our server would have gotten me fired. I was given a 1oz. Portion of jam for my order of 4 pieces of toast. This is not enough so after I finally get someone's attention I ask for more and was told by that person that I had to use what I had before getting more!!! What? This is ludicrous! I had guests in town and brought them in for brunch and was very embarrassed to be treated like a child by the waiter in front of them. Needless to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good, but limited offerings, and they don't make what you want. You pick what they choose. Wait time is ridiculous. Good food, but never again pay $40 for breakfast for my wife and I."}
{"text":"We arrived on a weekday afternoon at approximately 2PM.  

Wait staff was not very attentive.  A couple on the patio came in to ask if someone would be taking their order and asked if they could take out a menu to browse.  They were told someone would be out and no they were not allowed to take a menu outside.   The staff behind the counter was loud, when they were asked questions, they were not friendly.  I thought maybe one person was having a bad day - but it was all employees that had the same attitude.  

Food was adequate and way over priced for the quantity/quality.

I won't be back."}
{"text":"Lucky's Cafe is an excellent coffee shop on the edge of Tremont. It's in a very unassuming building. You wouldn't even think it was a coffee shop. But it is and it's a great one at that. The inside has a cozy coffee shop feel with two big, comfy couches right near the entrance. The staff is very friendly. There are several creative coffee drinks on the menu. There's also a great selection of baked goods as well as a brunch that has been ranked the best in Cleveland by several publications. Unfortunately, we were there way too late to try brunch but I aim to try it sometime, as the menu looked really good with several creative dishes. I had the medium roast coffee of the day and thought it was pretty good. It had a nice body to it. The real showstopper, though, was the chocolate hazelnut scone. It was phenomenal. Also, the fresh baked baguette was really good. I took a loaf home with me and thought it was great with olive oil. Overall, if you're looking for a good Cleveland coffee shop, head over to Lucky's in Tremont."}
{"text":"Oh man. Get the biscuits. They do not suck. Wow.

My wife and I visited this little place while in Cleveland, since we both sort of go where Guy Fiere has gone before when we get a chance. Lucky's did not disappoint.

I read some reviews where people discounted this place because water is served in a plastic cup. Really? Really really? Those people can go drink water out of glass cups at Applebees, while the rest of the world that knows better eats some of the best food I've had in Cleveland.

This place is quirky, fun and commited to local produce -- farm to table. The biscuits I had for brunch were perfectly done, and the gravy was out of this world. 

Get the biscuits. Just be ready for a food coma afterwards."}
{"text":"Went there on a Thursday morning so luckily no wait. Drill is to just grab a seat anywhere. Service was great. My server even gave me locations and directions to some interesting places to check out in Cleveland.

Had the shipwreck. I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of herbs and vegetables in the eggs, but they went a tad overboard with the potatoes. Had to dig around what looked like a whole potatoes worth of potato chunks to get to the eggs. Eggs were cooked a tad too long to the point where you couldn't taste the egg anymore either. Overall it was good but nothing to write home about. 

I think what bothered me most was the tiny little bowl of jam for all the toast. Server was happy to get some more, but still, shouldn't have to ask right?"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years but when I was there, that was enough to lease a lasting impression on me. The staff was laid back and very friendly. I loved the fact that it was relaxed and casual which seemed to create a welcoming vibe. I had the mac and cheese when I went which is super rich and I had to take the rest home. My only complaint (and this isn't a reflection on the restaurant) is that the parking sucks. Maybe it's time for a visit after all these years.."}
{"text":"Lived up to the hype. Great food and service. Cool space in a hip neighborhood. We were a little disappointed that breakfast sandwiches are not available after 9."}
{"text":"We had a table reserved for ten ( including two children). Let me start with the host who seated us. OMG she had a really bad odor. I know it's a hot environment but c'mon. Well we placed the order. I ordered an orange juice for drink which i recieved after I finished my meal. She never came back to check on us.I had the Ruben which I thought you can't go wrong with it. I was wrong. The toast was over toasted and was really greasy. The corn beef was barely visible in my sandwich and also very dry. The potato salad what comes with it was the best part of my meal. My wife ordered the \" famous\" biscuits and gravy. It was ok . Plenty of food even more gravy. Tasted pretty decent. Our friend ordered the \"Shipwreck \" which is: Omlett with bacon,and vegetables . Unfortunately the bacon was missing from the dish. We mentioned for the waitress who came to our table and ask her to flip trogh the Omlett so she can make sure we weren't make up. What a embarrassment !!  The coffe was great , atmosphere also cool. Food and service need improvement. Big disappointment ."}
{"text":"Their mac and cheese!!!! It comes with applesauce which you're supposed to put on the M&C and you should!!! It's great! The M&C is baked in a dish so it's SUPER HOT when it comes out which is super awesome. The cold applesauce is a good contrast and also cuts the creaminess of the cheese sauce. When i went inside to get a box for my leftovers, little birds attacked my dish. It was so cute I wasn't that mad although I did want my left overs... I'll just go back again. 
The biscuits with gravy are reallly good and hearty. The shipwreck is good but not great as it could use a little more flavor or pizazz or something. 
Service here is really friendly! I always love when I have the time to come in here."}
{"text":"I was staying at the Stratosphere and after a long day/night of walking the Strip I didn't feel like heading back out to find a place to eat. Lucky's is the only 24 hour place in the Stratosphere so we ate there. 
They had a special -- spaghetti and meatballs -- for $6 after 11pm so we both go that. What a deal! The meal was on par with fancy restaurants in Vegas and it left us extra cash for the slots."}
{"text":"Truly lovely establishment. Clearly a very trendy popular place in Cleveland, you'll have to wait for a bit to get in. 

Mac and cheese is definitely worth a visit alone.

The cupcakes were a disappoint, unfortunately- the cake was too dense and still crumbled, which was a shame because the buttercream was great."}
{"text":"We're still coming here, and still loving it. The quality of food and ambiance remains impeccable.  Overall, the staff has become friendlier. (Previously there were a few \"sore thumbs\", no longer.) We've gotten a little bored w the menu, but still consider this a favorite spot for brunch in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Delicious food that is farm to table. Everything is made in house and has such an amazing flavor. Their jam is the best!!"}
{"text":"Love where this place is and great place for sweets .
I had to leave my seat because it is not a great place for pescatarians who dont eat eggs. Not many choices.
Still a place for environment and would go to this place because of the vibe."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Tremont. The food and staff are great. You wont be disappointed with any plate served here. The biscuits are awesome."}
{"text":"Expensive, but save up for it.  This is a small place with attentive servers and unbelievable food.  I got the baked Mac'N'Cheese, disgusting pig that I am, and ate the whole thing.  It was like a brick of brie, mozzarella, and parmesan.  My only complaint is that they close early, I was in a huge rush to get there before 3!  Lucky's has possibly the best Mac'N'Cheese I have ever eaten, it also MADE Cleveland for me."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great seating area outside, excellent customer service and amazing food!!"}
{"text":"Went here on whom after reading some reviews and soooo glad I did! Best meal I've had in a long time. We ordered a Reuben and the Gingerbread Waffles! Absolutely delicious. Great selection of coffee drinks, Papa's mocha was great. We ordered the Pecan Bacon to give it a shot and wasn't the biggest fan of that. Overall, very pleased. Everything tasted so fresh."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Cleveland restaurants, and I frequently bring friends for brunch. The verdict is always a unanimous love. As the dining area is not very large, there is always a bit of wait. I typically enjoy a coffee a pastry while wait to be seated. The lemon curd tart is my absolute favorite. I've tried most of the items on the menu, and customers will find it appeals to vegetarians and meat eaters alike. All portions are very generous, and I've never gone home hungry. The pecan bacon is a very fun sweet and salty treat, which is ordered as a side. The bruleed steel cut oatmeal is the perfect mix of sweet and savory with the eggs en croute. Again, very filling and satisfying. My absolute favorite item on the menu is their baked Mac-n-cheese. This is a must try for any Brie lover. This cheesy dish is the perfect comfort food, topped with crispy brioche bread crumbs. The dish is complimented by Lucky's homemade apple sauce, which goes splendidly with the Brie in the Mac-n-cheese. Lucky's is a must-try for any brunch lover!"}
{"text":"The best. We are in from Toronto for a concert and saw this place on diners drive ins and dives. 

Sooooo amazing. We got the Reuben and breakfast burrito and shared a plate of maple pecan bacon. Everything is farm to table and fresh from a 100 mile radius. A bit pricy but worth it. Each main was a about $15 us.

Highly recommend to anyone visiting or in the area."}
{"text":"Very nice!!!
The place is so cute and welcoming! Stuff is really nice and professional. 
Food is delicious! Whats most important food is FRESH AND DELICIOUS!!! You can tell from the first bite! 
I loved that the menu is not 3 pages long but one small and easy! Enough to choose for your taste! 
Huge choice on the beverage list(any coffee or lattes you would only imagine)! 
In general, the ambience is warm and very cozy like if you were in your friends home.
would recommend \"Lucky's\"  to any of my friends and family! And definitely will be back there again! 
Good luck to you guys"}
{"text":"Had brunch here, which was delicious and loved the outdoor seating!  Service was a little free form and the lady at the front desk seemed a bit unhappy the morning we went."}
{"text":"Just tried it for the first time.  It may be a while before I return...

The food was good, and filling, but very pricey.  2 omelettes and 1 coffee cost us $32.  Yikes!  

Service was good enough, even though it was crazy busy.  They bring food out as it is prepared, not as a whole table together, even if there are only 2 people at the table.  There was a good 5 minutes in between meals that were brought out.  

The potatoes are cooked perfectly and have a good seasoning on them.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I honestly rarely go here anymore since they became all famous with Diners, Dives, and Drive-ins; which is sad because I now live within a short walk.  Damn Food Network had to go and make it crazy busy and make the wait and service usually become too bad to justify the good food.    The canoewreck is still mighty tasty, and it might just be my natural tendency to over-romanticize the past, but it seems like the portion has gotten somewhat smaller.  I just can't seem to stretch one for 2 or 3 meals like I used to.  I would say if you can sneak in on a weekday morning it might still be worth it, I'm not sure since I now work all weekdays.  I do know that even during lunchtime on a Tuesday I wasn't really able to get in and out of there in my allotted one hour lunch break.  I'll still give it three stars because I haven't really found anywhere else in town with a decent tofu scramble, but I generally am too hungry and impatient on a weekend morning to tough out the wait."}
{"text":"Scrambled tofu (not sure what the actual name is) was delicious. I like the ambiance of this place. The coffee's good too! As is the service."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to grab brunch in Cleveland. It's independantly owned, employs great wait staff, and hands down the best food. You can always identify a quality organization by thier actions, and after they picked up our tab when a sign fell on my wife, it became very clear that this is one of those operations. Highly recomended!"}
{"text":"Found this cool spot on Yelp. Took the fam there for brunch. Super biscuits, eggs and gravy. Great specialty bacon. Wonderful waffles. And cool staff. You will be happy."}
{"text":"I had brunch here a few days ago and everything was so delicious that I was inspired to join Yelp to write something super positive about the food here. It's a little expensive however they claim all ingredients are locally sourced and portions are fairly large. I definitely recommend this place for brunch in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I'm from the Philadelphia area visiting Norwalk, Ohio.  Up early to travel to Cleveland for \"this great brunch place\".  An hours drive.  We'll never get there.  And, when we do we are in an up and coming neighborhood, small place, very crowded, busy, lots of smiles, old store front, near an old Greek Orthodox Church (I think) with multiple spires.  Seated, French press coffee!  Everything baked on site!  Biscuits with scrambled eggs smothered with sausage gravy....delicious.  Think of Honey's Sit N' Eat to the second power."}
{"text":"Food was good, but not that good. Way over priced. I know it is all grown locally, but two breakfast entrees, bacon, one orange juice, brownie, and carrot cupcake with tip for $50, REALLY!  Carrot cupcake was awful. Orange juice had a strange taste! Probably would not go back!"}
{"text":"So after reading all these great things about Lucky's, and drooling over the online menu, SO and I decided to try it out for brunch on our last visit to CLV. I guess I didn't read the info very carefully, because I was expecting more restaurant and less coffeehouse. At first, I felt weird ordering a $32 breakfast at a counter at a coffeehouse. But damn, it was so worth it.

The coffee was awesome, strong but not bitter (which is important, since we drink it black). The pecan-crusted bacon proves why bacon, is, indeed, life (sorry vegetarians). SO's breakfast burrito was served in a ceramic casserole dish and was spicy and fresh. My pumpkin pancakes were topped with fresh apples and cream. I cannot tell you how good they were. Really. You have to taste it to believe it. I had to roll myself out of the place. 

We bought a couple pastries to go (you know, for a few hours later, when I could sort of breathe again). The cupcake had real buttercream frosting, although the cake itself was a bit on the dry side -- probably because it was the day after a holiday, so maybe they were 48 hours old? Still tasty though. Cranberry scone was really good.

The staff were really nice, and I was glad we chose the morning after Christmas to go, since it wasn't at all crowded. I can't wait to go back and try some of their other items."}
{"text":"Delicious! Only gave 4 stars because of the service. Had to ask multiple times for coffee and didn't get greeted for at least 5 minutes. Food was excellent and came out fast! Ordered the biscuits and gravy due to seeing it on the food network. Amazing, and can easily split with the ginormous portion they give you! Homemade cheddar buiscuts...yummmm! Also ordered the breakfast burrito as well. Sauce was a little too sweet for my liking, and also could have used some meat inside. Overall it's a great place for brunch but keep in mind you'll have to wait on the weekend."}
{"text":"As stated previously.... Food very good but service is horrible. How hard is it to bring a glass of water? Obviously very...asked three different servers and none of them brought it. My husband got his food and mine never came out so we had to find our server to ask about my food. After another 20 minutes it finally came out and we never got an apology or anything. Very disappointed. For as much money as you spend here you would expect better service."}
{"text":"I was not impressed with this restaurant at all. I traveled from columbus ohio to go there and thought the service was horrible. I and a few others I was with asked to change a few things and we got told this is ridiculous. They were very rude and unprofessional. It needs to be told you can make no changes to there items up front.  They did let us change it but only cause it was not busy."}
{"text":"Over priced. Only good dish is mac and cheese (delicious.) But otherwise dont waste your time.  Omelette bland. Granola too sweet. Shipwreck dry. I wish the food network had never ruined this place. Service was ok."}
{"text":"Great staff. Wonderful food. Fantastic establishment. Make sure you get there early for brunch, it fills up quick!"}
{"text":"Nice lunch spot.  The food is very fresh and all organic. I had a yummy turkey sandwich there.  Would definately go back."}
{"text":"I recently had breakfast here with a friend. The coffee selection is fantastic with something to please everyone. The French Press coffee was a good choice for us to split. The food is really good but I think that the prices are too high for what you get. Be prepared to spend $20-25 per person."}
{"text":"The air in my mouth has more taste than this food. And I started breathing in Cleveland under steel mills. How this woman gets away with prices equal to the mortgage payments on the claptraps surrounding the place I'll never know. Trust fund? Daddy taught her the best practices of Wall Street subprime securities pumped by ratings agencies on the take? Who knows. Proof that Food Network buzz could keep your uncle's leftover Spam sandwich in the black. The look on my mother's face when the \"locally grown\" corned beef hit her tastebuds was like she stepped into cat piss. Locavore hype meets styrofoam - $20 please! Biggest fraud in Tremont, which is high praise indeed."}
{"text":"Lucky's over-charged my credit card.

I got two coffees and a muffin to go on a quiet Saturday morning. The bill was $9. I balanced my checkbook later that week to see a $15 charge on my credit card. I emailed the restaurant, and got no response. Visitors to this restaurant should know to look closely at the charges on their bill. I used to be a regular, but I don't like having to scrutinize my coffee bills to see if I'm being cheated."}
{"text":"A unique and delightful little cafe, we descended on Lucky's for breakfast. The outdoor seating was perfect on this beautiful late summer morning. Service was prompt with many different helpers coming to the table. The tag-team approach worked well. Our party ordered the\"Shipwreck\", the \"Biscuits\" and two orders of \"Oatmeal\". All arrived fresh with nice presentation and within reasonable time. Quantities were generous; taste was delicious. The only reason Lucky's did not earn my 5th star was on price/value. $80 was a bit high for breakfast for four on picnic tables, but everything else about Lucky's rocks."}
{"text":"very friendly staff. diverse and cool atmosphere. nice selection of coffee drinks and food was pretty good. came after a bad experience at a competing cafe and this definitely is the better choice."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, but it was a tad pricy.  My family and I went here for lunch and the prices were a little crazy.  This place is good for a treat every once in a while."}
{"text":"Best food in cleveland!!! If you were to go out to breakfast, this is the place to be! Its not a reservation resturant so you have to get here fast for the food. Great family resturant it makes people very happy."}
{"text":"Lucky's Cafe was awesome!  I went there with co-workers, and we all loved it!  We have been on a quest this past year for great Ruben sandwiches and great mac and cheese, and this restaurant hit home runs with both.  Their mac and cheese was the best I have ever had, and their Ruben was great!  They are a little pricey, but it is because they use fresh and local ingredients.  In fact, they grow their own produce when in season, and they try to buy everything from within a 100 mile radius.  They make all of their own bread, they make their own thousand island dressing from scrach, ect...  Not to be missed.  I will definitely be back when in town for work!"}
{"text":"Great Sunday brunch to enjoy the great late-summer Cleveland weather. I was a little skeptical about the tiny, very busy restaurant that boasts farm to table and all local ingredients. Which, is usually a good idea, however difficult to find great chefs to boot. 
Well, I had a strawberry fizz (magnificent for the slight hangover headache) and the biscuits and gravy. Sooo yummy! And that says a lot from this recent Southern transplant! The \"famous\" bacon was interesting, however I probably won't be going back for it. I will, however be going back for the homemade biscuits, jam, and wonderful outdoor seating! 
I couldn't give 5 stars due to the very busy, and very unorganized nature of the hostess/seating ordeal, and having to fight the waiting crowd afterwards to pay for the meal. Still, we'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Lucky's was recommended by hotel staff for breakfast. Drive by looked a little rough with a group of customers standing next to counter. By the time we parked and entered the Cafe the backlog disappeared. We were immediately greeted, seated, and presented with an interesting menu. Very good coffee, water without having to ask for it. Six different selections were all very good. Waffle with a strawberry rhubarb compote,check. Excellent Ruben. Breakfast eggs&veggies were well prepared. Lucky's is doing things right with soft music excellent food and attentive staff. I hope to return the next time I visit Cleveland."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!! I had the shipwreck and my husband had the pancakes, best breakfast we've had in years!"}
{"text":"The coffee was delicious, the shipwreck was fulfilling, but the squash spatzel was one of the most delicious meals my girlfriend says she's ever had."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place to anyone staying at the Startosphere. The prices are very affordable and portions are super big and you can even share if you don't eat a lot. 

We had dinner and breakfast on Sat and Sun respectively. The dinner -  i had a preshiuto sandwich (I know spelling is wrong) with a side of fries - Yummy. (can't compare to Genova Delciatssen in Napa CA but it hit the sopt in Vegas when your super hungry and No car to drive around/ tipsy)
my dad had the club sandwich with fries - he loved it
my wife had the ceasar salad with chicken - HUGE portion and it was yummy. I tasty too"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Love the atmosphere. Definitely recommend you sit outside if it's a nice day.

Got the biscuits and gravy which were really good. Best way to enjoy it is by incorporating all elements (gravy, biscuits, etc.) into each bite. The cucumber water that was served was good too.

Big drink selection (especially on the coffee end) as well."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!!

The Mac & Cheese is amazing and so our their Brunch/Breakfast Waffles!! The wait is totally worth it. They also have a great selection of gourmet coffees. The waitstaff is excellent and are very knowledgeable about the menu. They are eager to recommend different dishes.

I would go every week if I could."}
{"text":"While I do love the food at Lucky's- and their outdoor garden and local sourcing- I would not go back because of their unwillingness to accommodate dietary restrictions with their diners. I have been twice and both times, while the servers have been very nice, they informed me they that the kitchen will not make any special requests on an entree. With so many dietary restrictions out there (gluten-free, vegetarian, etc), it surprised and upset me that they would be so unwilling to accommodate a very simple request (not including bacon on one of their most popular entrees when) when it could so easily be left out."}
{"text":"This is my first review, and will not be my last. After my continued experience at Lucky's, I am through being a passive yelper. I have been going to Lucky's nearly once a week ever since my girlfriend started working right in tremont. Lucky's is not a cheap date, so I have a great deal of time and money invested in this place. The food is delicious, don't get me wrong, but there have been a few 'incidents' that I need to report. 

They start serving brunch at 10 o'clock. They have breakfast sandwiches available from 7-9, with an hour in between to prepare (understandable...). I've gotten there on multiple occasions before 9 wanting a breakfast sandwich and have been turned away, with the claim that it is too close to brunch. Don't tell me you have breakfast sandwiches until 9 if this is not the case, it's just rude and a waste of my time. 

I started going here because I liked there approach toward sustainability and farm-to-table mindset, but the more and more I go the worse the taste gets in my mouth. This overpriced, yet delicious brunch, will not receive my business nearly as often as it once did."}
{"text":"The sweet corn pancakes with peach compote are fantastic. Very sweet, though, so be warned.

My wife enjoyed the brulee oatmeal.

Some of their drinks are quite good.

Servers were terse, bordering on rude."}
{"text":"A popular bruch spot in Tremont. If you come on the weekend, come early as the waits can be an hour or more. The menu has some fun takes on traditional breakfast foods-- maple pecan infused bacon is delicious! The only down side is that after a few visits you can explore most of the offerings, as variety is somewhat limited."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Tremont! The brunch is top notch and you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The waffles, omelettes, and biscuits are all fabulous. Do anticipate a wait though, as there's not a ton of seating inside. But the wait is certainly worth it!"}
{"text":"four stars for food, one star removed for service. now. i've never had truly terrible service here, but they are not as attentive as i think they could be. perhaps that comes with being so successful? It is hard to come by a water refill. which is important for me. 

Their food has been phenomenal almost every time, although two suggestions for lucky's, should the ever read this: the pecan bacon? bleh. its dry. i expected more of a syrup covering the bacon, with large chucks of pecan, not the dry powder that is currently caked on top of the bacon side. sounds good but if you're dining here i say PASS. Also the shipwreck menu item, very dull in comparison to everything else. with such a limited menu i'm surprised this one stays on there.  

but seriously. i happily pay $14 for your breakfast burritos. and the Creme bruleed oatmeal? OMG. I dream about it."}
{"text":"Great, comfortable atmosphere, excellent service, and fantastic food. I'm saving this place to be sure to stop in again and will recommends to all!"}
{"text":"DEEELICIOUSSS. That's what you want from a restaurant (or cafe), and that's what you get with Lucky's. It's small, but roomy, and has a homey feel to it. The people that work there (and many of the diners) are hipsters.The guy that was our waiter had this really funky mustache - there's a certain charm to it - but it was quite uncommon. Don't let that define his character, he was a really good waiter. Be prepared to run into hipsters and the like who see themselves as \"sophisticated\" drinking their expensive coffee while reading a Hemingway novel whatever it may be while listening to music on their iPhone...Christ.

The portions were big and enough to fill me up. At first I wondered if I should order to entree's, but one was enough.

The downside to Lucky's is the wait. It took 45 minutes for the staff to seat us due to high demand. And waiting in that small space, packed with people for 45 minutes is not fun at all. Luckily, we were able to peruse the space around the restaurant outside, though we rushed in after about 10 minutes because it was so cold. The other downside is the time Lucky's is open - only until 3pm every day. They only do lunch, breakfast, and brunch. Which stinks for those who would like to come in for dinner. But what can you do?

For those wanting to try a very unique restaurant, try luckys! 9/10 times it won't dissapoint. It's a bit pricey (~$10 for an entree) but it's an experience if you've never been there before."}
{"text":"You might be thinking to yourself that from the pictures this is just comfort food and you could make that at home. More than likely you would be wrong! Very wrong. This is elevated, high end comfort food that you are not going to get at home or at Cracker Barrel. (Nothing against them). But this is worth the price. Made from mostly fresh local ingredients by people who know how to use them. It is a small place and parking can be an issue but it is worth it to get there. Before I had biscuits and gravy here I feel like I never really had biscuits and gravy. I don't get them anywhere else now. Love this place."}
{"text":"We like to follow Guy's dives and diners, one of the best! I got the shipwreck delicious, my husband got the Cuban also very good. The service was great."}
{"text":"With breakfast / brunch being my favorite meal of the day, it is only natural that I absolutely love Lucky's Cafe.  Heather Haviland's concept of use of all local food is not only refreshing, it's also delicious!

With my first viist there almost 2 years ago, I'm still as hooked as I was when I first walked through their doors.  Speaking of walking through their doors, when you first step inside, you almost seem taken back by how small it really is.  

If you have a really long wait (sometimes up to 2 hours!), you can really start feeling claustrophobic, I highly recommend going during some off peak hours.  The decor is eclectic, artwork by local artists, bright colors, lots of natural light!  Overall, a perfect atmosphere to enjoy some brunch!   But I digress...let's move on to the food!

With my personal favorites of the waffles and mac & cheese, I'm not very creative when it comes to ordering.  However, I've always gone with others and have had the fortunate privilige of being able to sample their food.  

My highest recommendation would be for the waffles.  Lucky's changes the recipe dependant on the season and each season is delightful! My personal favorite is their winter recipe with the cinnamon waffles with apple compote and that home made whipped cream is totally TO DIE FOR! I could probably eat that every day for the rest of my life!

The mac and cheese is so delicious, as well.  They mix a variety of cheeses with perfectly cooked elbow noodles and serve it with grapes.  The grapes in the cheese sauce they use is heavenly and an unlikely combination.  

My friends have all had good luck with such menu items such as Vietnamese Grinder and the Shipwreck, all completely solid choices from my sample tastings! Overall, I almost dare say that you couldn't order a bad thing from their menu! 

That being said, their menu is small and doesn't have a lot of options for my vegan friends out there, but I give them props for their coffee bar selections.  Very expansive and all tasty! 

With the average price per menu item being in the $12 range, coupled with a $4 latte or coffee, you can easily spend $20+ per person, but when you look at the big picture with their delicious food, farm to table concept, friendly service, and eclectic decor, it makes it all worth it and then some!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this three stars, though let me be clear that the food deserves four or even five. I got the biscuits and gravy. The biscuits, topped with soft eggs and a smattering of pork gravy, were delectable. They had a nice crunchy-ish texture and slight cheesy undertones that went really well with the gravy. No question, they were some of the best biscuits I've ever had. The gravy itself was very good, too, though on its own, I think it is comparable to any good diner gravy. 

Only reason this gets three stars is the service was poor. We had a fairly large group -- 7 people -- and our meals came out staggered (probably 10 minutes between the time the first person got his meal and the time the last person got her meal). Also, there were big snafus with the drinks. I got a coffee right away, while my dad and grandfather, who actually ordered before me while I parked the car, got theirs about five minutes after mine came. My sister's chai tea, meanwhile, came about five minutes after that. Very frustrating. 

Not really sure what's going on with the service, but it really restrains what could be a phenomenal restaurant. As I said, the food was great, and I'd go back just to try the waffles, which looked delicious every time they passed the table."}
{"text":"Overrated. Cliche. Overpriced. Servers were friendly and cafe is very clean and comfortable. Menu has some interesting items and offers something for everyone I suppose. But..... Food is average at best. The cooks are very heavy handed on the details which makes for a muddled meal that is drowned out in sauces and such. And the prices are just bizarre in relation to either the quality or quantity. Given the other options in both Tremont and neighboring hoods, I'd pass and find something else."}
{"text":"**TOURIST REVIEW***

Visiting town and came here with a friend. It's a cute little place that has some really awesome looking sweets in the pastry case. On the walls are the all the CLEVELANDS BEST reviews, as best breakfast and best lunch. The place is small and most people we're waiting on outside for an outdoor seat (most desirable brunch seating I suppose). We got the Mac and Cheese with Apple Sauce, the biscuits and gravy and french toast. Biscuits was our favorite with mac and cheese next. Oh and something I think called a FIZZY, that is like fruit and club soda but it was fun to drink. 

It was good, but it wasn't like blow my socks off. I likely wouldn't wait for this food but its a super cute place. Oh and there is only 1 bathroom stall -- so you're going to wait. Lots of coffee runnin ' through folks. 

Support local business its important."}
{"text":"Luck was with us for finding this wonderful cafe...with only five breakfast choices, we selected two to share...homemade granola with yogurt and fruit and their famous biscuit and gravy egg dish. We topped it off with the Lucky Latte with honey!"}
{"text":"Just had brunch here for the first time last weekend and have to say this one is topping the charts as one of my favorite places to eat in Cle. 

They have a garden out back where they grow all their own fresh produce. Amish locals came by to drop off hand milled flour and other farm grown products while we were there. They have a covered outdoor patio with darling hand-painted tables and fence, and an artistic walkway. Not to mention the food is absolutely delicious, presentation is unique and adorable (check out the lemons on a stick in the attached photo), portion sizes are generous, and prices are reasonable. 

All in all a fantastic little restaurant. I just wish they had more than one restroom!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice, and every time I come, it is on a weekend that they have the corned beef hash on the menu.  Like a unicorn it always eludes me, and I seem to always get to my table as they sell the last little bit.  

My back-up dish is the biscuits and gravy.  Probably the most perfect breakfast on the planet!  

If you are going for the corned beef hash, get there SUPER early!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best breakfast meals I've had in a while. All the fresh vegetables scrambled into the Shipwreck just enhanced the taste of the traditional egg, hash browns and bacon breakfast. Even the toast and fresh fruit were nicely presented and tasted wonderful. Simple meal, tons of flavor, good prices and located in the beautiful Tremont area of Cleveland; enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food.... That being said the service is a total pile of shit. So be prepared for that."}
{"text":"My best friend and I had a girls weekend and came here for brunch. There was a problem with our food, and the manager, Alisha, was at our table right away. She made it up to us over and above. We would absolutely recommend it and went back again the next morning, upon the manager's request. Even though there was an issue, I cannot give them anything but 5 stars for the service and the experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food and exceptional. One thing to note, if you taking kids don't expect to make changes to the menu items. Not a lot of flexibility, but on the bright side the food, setting and ambience is amazing."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday for their brunch, it was raining so the outside wasn't really open. This made the wait almost an hour, but it was so worth it! We got the biscuits and gravy and the lemon waffles and both were amazing! They gave us a free smoothie that was also delicious. Highly highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"peppermint patty.

i will be addicted to this fabulous place.
why?

peppermint.patty.drink.

it's a party in my mouth.
the peppermint patty party ...in my mouth.

this place is so great i break into alliteration.

not only that, but their brunch is one of the best i've ever had.  i've been several times, and each time i go back i get something different.  never disappointed.
and i'm easily disappointed.
ah, brunch for emo kids."}
{"text":"Was taken here by Ohio-ans (is that right?) and expected to eat some great brunch food after seeing Lucky's on DDDs. We waited about 15 minutes on a Sunday morning and were seated outside. Maybe it was the incredibly hot weather, but upon receiving my veggie omelet, I was less than impressed. The omelet boasted garden-grown vegetables, which were delicious. Aside from the veggies, this omelet lacked taste and was not what I expected from a place that specializes in brunch. The potatoes that accompanied the omelet were OK, but not stellar. What really blew me away was the pecan maple bacon. Without this bacon, I would have left hungry from Lucky's-it was sweet, salty and crunchy all at the same time. Truly delicious. I did, however, sneak a bite of my bf's biscuits and gravy and they were delicious. Maybe if I am back in the area I will give Lucky's another try."}
{"text":"interesting place. Good food. We had the mac and cheese and waffles which were both phenomenal, sausage and biscuits were good. Service not so great. Waiter was on something and/or asleep on his feet. Could not remember who we were or what we ordered. If we go back hopefully we will not get the same waiter."}
{"text":"When I am paying $20 for eggs I am not only paying for food but for a nice experience and service. I brought a friend from out of town to eat here on a Friday morning. Chose a weekday to make sure we had good service (because of the weekend brunch reviews about the bad service and waits) and we had a terrible experience anyways...

Sat at the table for 20 minutes before 2 waters showed up that one of the cooks brought to us because he felt bad. Then they took our order saying they were short staffed.

Then we never got the drinks until the food was almost at the table and I asked the waitress if she forgot so she went and got them. 50 minutes after we sat down on a weekday morning we finally get the food.

The food tasted good but I can get good breakfast in a lot of places in Cleveland so I won't be coming back here to pull off with unaware managers that don't know how to staff their restaurants.... and waitresses that forget they have to serve you.

Verbal apologies but no one offered complimentary drinks to make sure we came back after the ridiculous experience, no one cared. They charged 5 for a coffe and 5 for a coke. I guess they charge you like a taxi...  by how much it takes to get it to you. The only reason why I pulled up with the wait was because I had an out of town visitor and I didn't want to make her experience even worst. We felt we were begging for free food and drinks by the way we were treated.

People should have some self respect and spend their money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great place. The food was delicious- Mac and cheese was amazing!!  Staff was friendly and brought us bubbles and sidewalk chalk to keep our three kiddos busy while we waited. They had outdoor picnic table for us to sit at and enjoy the beautiful day.  So glad we stumbled upon this place. Will not disappoint!!!!"}
{"text":"MmmMmMMMmmm mmMm... oh excuse me... Sorry, I'm in a cheesy blissful state... Ahem-- let me compose myself...

Baked mac-N-cheese... this is no joke. Dearest Yelpers, please be sure to treat yourself to this delicious meal when in the Cleveland area. You'll thank me later. 

\"How cheesy can this be?\", you might be wondering. Well, let me open your eyes to a new level of creamy cheesy goodness: pasta and cream topped with bread crumbs and baked with cheddar, brie, parmesan, and mozzarella. Ohhh yeahhh. And who would have thought their sweet homemade applesauce would be the perfect compliment to this cheesy treat? 

We also got one of their specials: an omelet with goat cheese, bacon, scallions, and sweet corn. Delish!

The coolest part was that as we left, we saw our server outside in the garden cutting some scallions-- the same scallions that were in my omelet! Pretty sweet, right? Yeah, its on the pricey side. But you know you're getting the most local ingredients... aka. right outside the kitchen!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I've never had anything but breakfast foods here. But that's because the breakfast is freaking amazing. The Shipwreck is all you can ask for in an egg scramble and I am not usually an orderer of carb heavy brunches (I'm an egg girl) but the waffles are truly outstanding; fruit compote, honey whipped cream, sigh. And if you're a fan of macacroni and cheese then this one should not be missed. A great place for brunch any day of the week."}
{"text":"A great breakfast spot in the hipster neighborhood that is Tremont.  Again another triple D find.  On my first visit I had what I would call a breakfast sundae with house made granola (if you are a fan of puffed cereal, do not miss this one), vanilla yogurt, fruit and a drizzle of Ohio honey.  I also ordered the pecan bacon, OMG good!  My first visit was a 5 star experience just for the bacon alone.  

I made one more breakfast visit.  This time I ordered the biscuits and gravy.  This is where I had to downgrade to 4 stars.  The gravy was so salty is was not edible.  After some time they offered to remake, but I was in a hurry so I just had to eat the rest and scrap off the gravy.  Potatoes, eggs and biscuit were excellent though.

Do yourself a solid and just order a side of anything with their bacon.  Cappuccino was excellent too.  They have many tempting delectables in the bakery case, but I opted for a bag of puffed cereal granola"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast/ brunch spot in Tremont area. Parking is curbside and might be hard to find on busy Sundays. We got an order of the mac n cheese fit the table.. I highly reccomend at least trying it, excellent with the slightly sweet homemade applesauce. We eve took home some cookies and fresh jam"}
{"text":"Ok, sorry Lucky's, but I have to be honest.

I have had several great experiences here, but lately, I have felt really frustrated.

I know you are out-the-ass crowded, like, all the time now that you've been hanging out with Guy Fieri and the Food Network.  But I shouldn't have to stand there for 10 minutes waiting for a cup of take-out coffee when I'm not even waiting for a table for a party of eight like everyone else is.

Also, this other time, it was raining and then it stopped.  You (nicely) coerced me and my friend to sit outside to get quicker service, even though the tables were still wet and we didn't get menus for like 15 minutes.  We had to wait a long time for water and coffee.  And then you started seating EVERYONE outside, which really didn't help matters because now instead of waiting inside to get served we were waiting outside.  And it was pretty cold!  We didn't want to be there.

Your staff checked in on us a few times to let us know that it was all \"on the way,\" but here's the thing.   The intention of giving good service, and ACTUALLY giving good service, are two different things.  I think if you want to keep this a place in which people are happy and well-fed, and not just a tourist trap, you need to do something.

Also, I'm sorry to say that I have to stop getting your happy cookies.  Because every time I spend $4 on ONE frickin' cookie, I am not too happy."}
{"text":"The Mac and Cheese was very good and that applesauce was the best I've ever tasted!! Prices were kind of high but with everything being made from scratch it fine with me."}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's not too big so there is usually a wait.  But it's worth it.  Food is so good.  Great service.  Cute place."}
{"text":"We ate there on Tuesday and the food was great!  We got there right as the kitchen was closing and they still took our order.  Delicately recommend!"}
{"text":"Lucky's had great reviews, for me it was over priced for the fact that it's brunch and I could get a similar option for half the price. The staff was nice , they pull tips which helps everyone take care of you. Unfortunately I was sat at this huge table and could barley hear anything my friend said the entire time. I wouldn't go back for brunch but maybe a coffee or pastry."}
{"text":"Get the biscuits and gravy, and whatever the special fizzy is for the day. You're welcome. 

There isn't really anything bad on the menu here. My wife gets the mac and cheese every time, and the pecan bacon is a great side to share.  The Reuben is great for dine in but if you're getting it to go the bread can get soggy. 

Prepare for a wait, especially on the weekends. If you live or are staying nearby you can call in orders to pick up which is much faster, just squeeze in and ask someone at the coffee bar about your order."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS FARM TO TABLE

I love coming here for the great atmosphere (coffee shop like) and yummy food.

I've gotten a few different things and you seriously can't go wrong with any order. Their coffee is good too. 

Lines can get long but there are some cute shops nearby to pass the time (April Snow, Evie Lou, Wine by Design)."}
{"text":"Very cool place! Food was creative while still keeping with the comfort food style and the service was grade A. The attitude of any staff is key in setting a comfortable environment and you can tell how happy and in sync the whole staff is. The pecan bacon is out of this world as well!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch after yelping 'best breakfast in Cleveland, Ohio' since my bff lives in tremont and I'm not 100% in the know for this area. We were both so pleased, they would have got 5 stars but some aspects of the service left room for improvement and this is the most expensive breakfast I ever had in my life. 

My bff did the waffles which were so darn good (I tried them for good measure). I went with the special, which was a chicken chili over shells. Served with a side of tiny diced onion, olives and sour cream. I asked for them to add cheddar cheese, which they did before throwing into the oven to get all perfect on top. My only question is, how could they serve this special without the cheese? I should do this for a living. 

Even though our bill was $40 before tip, I would still come back. The food was just that good.  They pull tips so some people give off that I don't care attitude. I felt some of the other wait staff was so accommodating and friendly, that the good out weighed the bad. We didn't wait for a table or our food long, which is always good when dining out."}
{"text":"Decent food, overpriced. Great ambience, especially if you can sit outside. The service is average. Make sure you have time to wait."}
{"text":"I am thankful that I was able to try this place, while driving around on a food road tour. the scallion and cheddar biscuits with sausage gravy was huge!  Definitely enough for two people.  Great biscuits and fantastic small chunks of sausage in the gravy, making this a flavorful and hearty meal.  I LOVE their homemade hot sauce as well!  I was slightly disappointed that my server never mentioned the specials, as I overheard her discussing those with the table behind me.  Bummer, for those specials sounded good!  I also had no idea about the check out process.  After sitting at the table for 10 minutes, my server advised me that I simply needed to bring the letter card up to the front for check out.  look for a small letter card on your table, and take that up front when you are ready to leave.  wish I had known this process from the beginning.  Anyway, other than that, it was a good experience, I like what Lucky's is doing, and would absolutely go back if I am ever in Cleveland again!"}
{"text":"I went there for breakfast, they have a very limited menu, and all I wanted was eggs, toast and hashbrowns. They can only make scrambled eggs. The waitress said I could get eggs and toast and hashbrowns and that she would just charge me for three sides, which would be Three dollars each. So after waiting 18 minutes for my food, I get a plate of scrambled eggs and two slices of toast. So I asked the waitress where my hashbrowns were and her reply was, well I did not know you wanted hashbrowns. I waited long enough for the breakfast so I chose not to wait another 18 minutes for hashbrowns. Then it took me almost another 10 minutes to get her attention to bring my check. And to find out she charged me four dollars for two slices of bread. Not very happy, the food was just average at best and service was not very good. I'm not going back"}
{"text":"another gem in tremont is luckys, where youll get some of the best home cooking around...for brunch, there isnt any other choice

the seating is really limited, and its always crowded, so be prepared, but it generally goes pretty quick, most people understand that they should eat and move on because its always obvious someone is waiting for your seat...you wont feel rushed, but you probably wont linger over a third cup of coffee discussing how much youd like to take a nap after eating so well

as is my usual, ive probably tried everything at some point, i tend to get the specials and have a forkful of whatevers going on around me...and everything is always full of flavor and tastes like it took hours to make (somethings do, too, pretty much everything is made from scratch, from the biscuits to the hot sauce, which, dont get me started on the amazing, secret recipe hot sauce).

a must visit when in cleveland"}
{"text":"Excellent place for the weekend brunch. Suitable for dating and food is excellent. European style is perfect for my friends and me. Staff are friendly. The only thing is they are busy on Saturday usually, visit there Sunday or week day will absolutely make your experience 6 stars."}
{"text":"Lucky's is a lesser-known gem. I had never been there until recently, and it was incredible! All local, made in-house, amazing food, drinks, and service. If you even remotely enjoy oatmeal, do yourself a favor and go on Saturday or Sunday to get it. Out of this world. Lucky's latte and the fizzies never disappoint."}
{"text":"I'm from SFO area but was visiting Cleveland for family gathering. I saw Lucky's review on yelp and wanted to try. Even my husband who is originally from Cleveland and his sister, plus mother all did not know about this place. We all had a great experience. Right after we got there, the line got long so we were lucky. I think they are very creative. I will go back again to try other dishes. next time I will share the main dish so I have some space to get some desserts."}
{"text":"About 3 weeks ago my family and I visited Lucky's. I had heard such awesome things that I couldn't wait to try it. It really was not the best experience, the wait staff were fine even though very busy, it really is the value that is lacking. I am all for paying more for very fresh local ingredients, but the food must match. We had 2 burgers, the famous gingerbread waffles and a cupcake. The bill was $60+ and really any diner would have been better. The cupcake was so dry it was inedible, the burgers were good but the waffle was less than ordinary. I am glad I tried it, however we will not be back."}
{"text":"Very limited menu.  Food was great.  Good wait service. Again, VERY limited menu."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and checked it out a few weeks ago. I am telling you this place is the hidden jewel of Tremont, nay Cleveland, nay NE Ohio. The gouda mac and cheese with bacon and homemade cinnamon apple sauce is off the chart. The rueben is not even on the same planet as other ruebens in the area, including Slyman's. The vanilla bean waffle with rhubarb compete (what?) and house made caramel whip cream is to die for, but a bit rich after a full meal as a dessert. The sausage gravy and biscuits are the second best I have ever had (my great grandmothers were a little better but that could be my memory talking)."}
{"text":"-Amended review. I suggest going here a few times before coming to a conclusion... my first visit was fabulous.... my second visit was unlike the first... The food here is delicious there is not dispute there. However, the service is inconsistent. Even though they claim to be a \"breakfast\" place, they open at 7 and yet the kitchen doesn't start serving breakfast until 9am... Soo until 9 am there are really just a locally sourced coffee & pastry shop. Sounds to me like they are missing out on a lot of morning business doing things that way. My second complaint is the latte I received today. I paid for a 16oz and when I got home (a 5 min drive) I realized my cup was only 75% full. I am a former coffee barista and knew my cup felt light but I was in a hurry and naturally didn't expect to see all the space in my cup upon removing the lid. The Barista was short and unpleasant therefore I didn't return to have my drink corrected. I am hesitant to return... good food isn't everything, and in my opinion service can make or break a place."}
{"text":"Oh so good! People need to get over the price. You have to pay the price for organic and local produce. Support local business. 
Best biscuits and gravy I have ever had! Our server told us to try different dishes because it was our first time there. But we all ended up getting biscuits and gravy with a side of the pecan bacon. We also ordered a smoothie and this caramel latte (I forgot what it was actually called on the menu). The biscuits had eggs on top and smothered in gravy. There were potatoes on the side and some grapes. Everything is local and organic. What more could you want? 
I don't think I could complain about anything. The service was great. I just wish I could've eaten more. 
Tip: they don't split checks."}
{"text":"Love Lucky's! My favorite brunch in the neighborhood. I only wish I could order a mimosa there and then it would be perfect! Definitely a busy place with not a ton of seating, I'd try to call ahead. Their biscuits & gravy are to die for."}
{"text":"Awesome Frigging Brunch. 

Those three words basically sum this place up. Lucky's cafe is a.... is a... well... to me it is a Brunch Cafe that utilizes home grown and locally sourced produce and makes everything (including the breads etc) inhouse to serve you some really really really really really (you get the idea...) delicious food! 
This time, I had their special - Ratatouille... Odd choice of breakfast you say? Not so much when it is served on a bed of uber awesome cheddary cheesy grits and covered with two sunny side eggs! Mmmmm....

My all time favourite is their Breakfast Burrito ($16). Amazingly big, amazingly good. Try it. 

Go here if you want good food, an amazing brunch, and you don't mind a bit of a wait and really quick turnarounds on your service.... 

(PS - amazing baked goods too!)"}
{"text":"I have been trying to get in a brunch here for awhile as I've found tremont has the best brunch spots. 

Our table got the shipwreck, biscuits and gravy and baked Mac and cheese. The shipwreck was excellent, a little heavy on the veggies for me, I like more bacon. The baked Mac and cheese was amazing. I love Mac and cheese and this was so flipping good. The biscuits and gravy will make you cry. These babies were so good. Cheddar biscuits with eggs, hash browns and gravy. We got to sit on the patio and it was so nice. I will say the bill was a bit more than I was expecting, $65 for 3 of us, but with the detail and quality of the food it was more than worth it!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. French press coffee is good, the food comes out fast, the wait might get long, but it is all worth it. The shipwreck plate is one of my favorite hash dishes ever with the perfect ingredients and came in a huge portion. I didn't even finish it and it was amazing. The toast is really good there too.  The biscuits and gravy were great even if you aren't a big fan of the dish....you should try it. It is very hearty and great for a warm day. The pumpkin waffles (with heavy cream....amazing) and poached apple slices and etc was also good. I think they change the flavor of the waffles around but it is pretty sweet and worth getting if you have a sweet tooth at all. The service is friendly and the place does not take RSVP but I think will allow you to call ahead.

Things I didn't eat that I will try in the future: baked mac looked amazing and also the special beef stew. The reuben sandwich also looked good even though I almost never would considering ordering one in general (and would def try it here). Only issue? too much good food and not enough time or people to split it with. The tables are on the smaller side so best for groups under 4."}
{"text":"Two words say it all:  Incredible Food!  

Owner and Chef Heather H. is incredibly committed to the local food movement.  It is my understanding she sources as much as possible locally. She also grows some of her own herbs and veggies right outside the restaurant.  The staff is excellent & accommodating.

Finally, my personal favorites-- I adore the biscuits and gravy!!  The cream cheese brownies--heaven!!"}
{"text":"I feel so mixed writing this review.

The food here tastes amazing.

Yet the experience of eating here is really rough. If you want to re-live the worst parts of middle or high school the wait staff will happily oblige.

Trust me, no matter how cool you are, you are not cool enough for the staff that works there. You want a water refill? Be assured of a nasty comment along with a glare. You are the jerk for asking.

I have visited four times.

All four times the food has been out of this world delicious. All four times I have been treated like trash by the wait staff. Even thought I was asked to pay almost $20 for a bowl of oatmeal.

I crave their biscuits and gravy, they are, hands down, the best I have ever had.

I went back after the first visit when a waitress, literally, yelled at me (in front of the whole restaurant) for signing my name in to the wait list without her permission. I went back when I was told asking for substitutions was not allowed (My substitution? Gravy on the side when I ordered Biscuit and Gravy. They told me it wasn't allowed.). I went back when I was confronted for using the restroom without permission. 

I really want to go back again because the food is so delicious, I am just afraid of what I might do wrong.

Visit if you want great food and have a very strong will.

It has been almost six months since my last visit. Against all odds I went back for a $60 breakfast with my husband and child. I was given a hard time because I had a baby (a high chair didn't mesh well with the restaurant lay out, or so I was informed). I guess that was the straw that broke the camel's back for me. No matter how tasty the food is I seriously don't want to be spoken to so meanly or be given a hard time for having a child.

Good bye Lucky's. I gave you four tries, hopefully others will give you more."}
{"text":"Delicious food, generous portions, and super cool vibe.  Service was outstanding.  Not really great for kids, but it worked fine with my three boys under 10."}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy breakfast is delicious.  Homemade cheddar scallion biscuits topped with scrambled eggs topped with a country sausage gravy that is flavorful and a plate scraper.  Shipwreck is very good with a mixture of scrambled eggs, potatoes and fresh veggies.  Menu is very unique and they have their own herb garden.  A little pricey for breakfast (Shipwreck and mangos iced tea $17) but it is Tremont.  Mango iced tea really didn't have much mango flavor.    Service is good."}
{"text":"Coming to Cleveland from Los Angeles, we were skeptical about finding good coffee and great brunch. Lucky's Cafe went above and beyond our expectations. In fact, brunch here was the best meal of our trip.

The Mama's White Mocha is sweet and delicious. You can tell beans are fresh, milk is warmed to perfection and these baristas know the business. Star-barf coffee has nothing on Lucky's.

As for food, I ordered the breakfast burrito and my boyfriend ordered the turkey omelet. My burrito was good, but maybe beans or veggies would add a little something extra? I nibbled on my boyfriend's omelet, which I wished I'd ordered. The creamy sauce on top, and corn/red pepper combo inside was an explosion of deliciousness in my mouth. Their hash browns are homemade, not frozen. We also ordered the mac and cheese. Oh. Em. Gee. Big noodles, lots of cheese and crumbs on top for some extra crunch. You can tell their ingredients are local. Lucky's left us full as we made our way to the airport.

Staff was friendly and eclectic, something that stood out from other Cleveland spots. As for people calling the coffee \"overpriced,\" you get what you pay for. Starbucks is almost $6 a cup. Why not support local?

If I lived in Cleveland, Lucky's would be my go-to spot.

Side note: I'm currently writing this in the Cleveland Airport while noshing on my blueberry coconut scone. Their pastry selection is out of this world."}
{"text":"This place has consistently satisfied even the pickiest breakfast-eaters among my friends. 

What I would boldly go for: 
- the shipwreck (omelet heaven goodness; don't forget to try the house hot sauce with it and ask for HOUSE JAM to go with your toasts)
- the mac & cheese (oven-baked with penne pasta and served with apple sauce! Hot cheesy mac & cheese go really well with cold tart apple sauce) 
- pecan bacon (on a thicker side, coated with pecan bits and shined with maple gloss. I tried similarly configured bacons at numerous breakfast places Columbus, which I don't think even compare to Lucky's) 

Other honorable mentions:
- the waffles with seasonal toppings: these are hit or miss depending on the seasonal fruit and compote. Sometimes I was in love, sometimes I had left overs that I didn't want to take home.
- biscuits & gravy: it's good, but on a saltier side. But then I'm a salt police. So you make your own call. 

The only thing to watch out for is how long you may have to wait in line on weekends. I suggest going with a relaxed heart if going for a Saturday or Sunday breakfast. Also, I would focus on the breakfast items rather than the pastry/cake section in the front."}
{"text":"I popped I for breakfast at 9am. Which happened to be exactly when the kitchen opens. 

I ordered \"biscuits\" and an Italian roast coffee. \"Biscuits\" is biscuits and sausage gravy with eggs and green onions. 

Pros:
-The biscuits were really good. Didn't get soggy under the gravy. 
-The sausage gravy was really nice. A good texture and sufficient sausage. 

Cons:
-They didn't ask me what kind of eggs I wanted. They just came scrambled that  was kind of weird but still okay. 
-Service is SLOW. They had one server for 5 tables. 
-the meal was honestly kind of bland. The concept was great but the gravy over powered the seasoning in the biscuits etc. 



Prices are high, but they source everything from local farms and everything is made from scratch, so in think it's worth it"}
{"text":"I was extremely disapointed with Lucky's. It is the sort of snooty place that makes no substitutions for any reason, even if that means you can't eat ANYTHING on the menu. The coffee is great. I have no problem with this place as a coffee shop, but if you are going to serve food, you have to be willing to accommodate the customer. I was extremely pleasant to the server, explaining why I wanted to make a change to my order. He took a firm stand, so I tried to make it easy for him because I was hungry. I asked what I was supposed to order then. His suggestions were all impossible for me to order, showing he was ignorant to my food alergy. That is fine, although surprising for a place that claims to be so forward thinking when it comes to healthy ingredients. When I settled on eggs, I politely asked for him to just not put the toast on my plate. I pointed out that isn't changing anything, it is just not wasting bread that no one was going to eat. This place is supposed to care about the environment, after all. 

Sure enough, the plate comes out with the toast on top of my food, completely contaminating it. Now, who knows what goes on in kitchens, but I can't ignore it when it is right in front  of me. I thought he must have forgotten. NOPE, in his other hand was an empty plate. He smiled, explaining it was for me to put my toast on. He thought he was being soooo considerate, completely ignoring my needs and wants, and polite requests in the process. 

People with gluten or other food allergies do not need to eat at Lucky's. However, if we do wander in there with a group of people, and have already been seated, it would be nice that on this first encounter you would be at least human and serve us something we can eat. Just that one time, before we know it is the type of place that does not welcome people with dietary restrictions. We promise, we won't come back. We would just like to eat something that first time."}
{"text":"Great food, local ingredients, friendly staff, happy atmosphere, classic menu with unique ingredients. For example, I had the gingerbread waffles with whipcream and baked apples. The baked apples were still a little crunchy, just the way I like them."}
{"text":"No joke I've wanted to come to Lucky's for almost two years for one thing, and one thing only. The granola. During a road trip pit stop in Cleveland, I HAD to come by here. The granola is excellent and keeps you full for a really long time. The soy latte...wow.

Everything they serve is as fresh as it gets, from the eggs, to their freshly baked bread, to their homemade jam which by the way is the best jam I've ever had. The service is very good and the servers explain where all the ingredients have been sourced from.

New York needs more places like this. Until next time, Lucky's!"}
{"text":"Our party visited Lucky's on Mother's Day morning, so we weren't surprised by the wait. The friendly hostess took our names, and we walked around lovely Tremont for an hour, then returned to Lucky's. Our name had already been called, but we were seated within a few minutes. Our waiter (a slim brown-haired youth with a mustache) was very attentive, fast, and friendly. He immediately noticed, as they were being set down by another server, that our water glasses had smudges, and returned momentarily with replacements. We had attentive service from additional servers, the food arrived very quickly, and the chef made her rounds to check on guests' satisfaction. Yes, the food is overpriced and the crowd at the door is off-putting. However, the mac & cheese is the best I've ever had, and the portion was big enough for me to take the leftovers home. The Vietnamese sandwich was also superb. Having visited similarly hip, mobbed establishments in other cities, my biggest pleasure at Lucky's was that not a single staff person was snooty and scenester-y."}
{"text":"Oftentimes, there is a line to get seated... Lucky's is well-worth the wait! Their Mac n' cheese is a flavorful, go-to choice."}
{"text":"This is tough.  Parking sucks given the location, especially if you are traveling from other parts of CLE to get here.  But once you manage to park and get there, you can enjoy the morning waiting to get in.  I am confident you will get stuck in a line, possibly a long line.  But, in this case, it is a testament to quality of the food.  It has been worth every minute.  

The food is locally sourced where possible.  The portions are huge.  In most cases you can share.  The menu options are very creative and change on a regular basis.  There is a bake shop up front if you want something from there.

There are even signs on the table reminding you that other people are waiting for your seat.  It is not rushing you out, just trying to gently remind you.

So big thumbs up."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness.  Cleveland has a real gem in this little place!  Great food, service and atmosphere.  It has a great vib, and I can't wait to go back! 
I had the waffles, my husband the biscuits--we traded half way through--so very good!!!!"}
{"text":"I read the previous reviews and knew two things about Lucky's. The food was probably going to be pretty good and there's some weird issue going on in the back of the house. Both were confirmed.

We had a party of eight and had made reservations (I appreciate that they do take reservations since it's packed on weekends). The charming woman working the dining room was very friendly and chatted with us while we were getting settled. Our waiter was very chatty as well and explained the local food angle, all that was fine. The issue with ordering and what can and cannot be asked of the kitchen was just plain asinine. Why should I feel like a pariah because someone in the party wants a fried egg and not a scrambled egg? Thankfully they did condescend to put the toppings for the waffles on the side for one of the kids.

We met friends at the restaurant who were very keen to try it and obviously knew the kitchen rules as well as we did, but honestly it's too much stress to deal with a persnickety kitchen on a regular basis. There's just too many good restaurants in Cleveland to bother with the kitchen dysfunction. I don't want to say it's arrogance or staffing issues because I don't know, but it really does cast a shadow over the experience going in and wondering if someone with you is going to commit some kind of ordering faux pas. All that said, the waiter was *nice* about what they could and couldn't do, but what they couldn't do was a hefty list of what I would consider to be minor concessions to preference. 

We did get our food pretty fast, maybe the limited variation is responsible for the fast service, but the follow up on refills for the coffee and water was very sparse, I was never offered more decaf though thankfully my wife's fully-caffeinated beverage was refilled, sparing everyone her wrath. 

I had the shipwreck and thought it was tasty, though it had mushrooms that were not listed on the menu. This is one danger of menu, with the focus on local sourcing the ingredients can change. The selection of veggies in the Shipwreck was otherwise good and there was plenty of very well buttered toast to go with it. Others in our party who ordered the biscuits and the waffles  gave them very positive reviews. 

I don't recommend this place for kids, especially picky eaters, anyone with food allergies that might need to substitute or remove an ingredient, or middle-aged curmudgeons like me who are too old to play games in order to eat breakfast."}
{"text":"Just make the caloric commitment and go. 

Last time, I had the gingerbread waffles with honey whipped cream, caramel and apples. 

Time before that I had the mac and cheese.

Time before that I had the granola.

Time before that I had the chocolate bomb.

I think I have gained 4-7 lbs. on this place and each and every pound has been worth it. That is all."}
{"text":"I was here for Sunday brunch in August 2015. Long wait. Wasn't bad, but didn't blow my mind. Just didn't live up to the hype. I would definitely go again if friends or family expressed an interest."}
{"text":"Breakfast for cheap, after midnight (till 5am). I can't argue with that. Had the basic eggs, toast, hash brown combo both nights I was there and washed it down with a coke. They only charged me for the food both nights, so I'm not sure if soda is free, like in the casino? Nevertheless, I left a nice tip for the waitress."}
{"text":"My family and I were traveling through Cleveland to Niagara falls the week-end of 9/6/13 and I decided to make Lucky's our breakfast stop on Saturday morning.  I read some fairly good reviews and searched yelp before coming to my decision.  We were seated and told of their local offerings, all farm fresh to the table.  I appreciate good clean food.  My children wanted to split the waffle option, though, my oldest child did not want all of the fancy fruit toppings so we requested he receive syrup on the side instead.  We eventually received our food, my youngest with the waffle topped with fruit and whipped cream, my oldest a plate of waffle only.  When we requested the syrup, again, we were told there would be a roughly $4.oo charge and that it could not be a replacement for the fruit topping.  We were told this without apology or concern.  I couldn't have my son eat just a waffle, so frustrated and confused we requested the syrup.  What we received was so laughable!  It was basically a thimble full of syrup for $4.00!  We are no stranger to good quality syrup, I do not buy sugar water for my children.  The waitress refused to let the $4.00 charge go to replace the fruit for the syrup.  She was very unfriendly and unconcerned.  

I ordered the shipwreck and I was unimpressed.  It wasn't very flavorful.  I wanted to ask for some hot sauce or salsa but I was afraid of the extra charge and hassle and ridiculous story regarding the harvesting of the tomato and cilantro for the salsa brought in from another country on horseback...   or some other nonsense. 

This place is so pretentious and overpriced.  Never again."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast spots in Cleveland.  Lots of locally grown and sourced items, they even have a working garden to keep seasonal items ultra fresh.  Always struggle between the pancakes and whatever else looks and sounds good that day!"}
{"text":"Good food, coffee drinks, dessert & service. I have been to Lucky's many times for brunch. The food is always good the service is always fast and everything always taste fresh. They have a wide variety of coffee drinks which are all excellent however there is not much variety if you want things like soy almond or coconut milk. They have a variety of baked goods which are all excellent and the food options are limited but good. I'm a fan of the shipwreck and It never disappoints."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough great things about this place. It's always packed but usually never have to wait too terribly long for a table. Love to sit outside in the summer. The food is absolutely amazing. I've had the shipwreck, which is wonderful but the absolute best thing are the sausage gravy and biscuits and the pecan crusted bacon. Just let me tell you this, I HATE sausage gravy and biscuits with a passion..it looks like, pardon my expression please, but it looks like \"puke on a plate\". The biscuits and gravy at Lucky's are PHENOMENAL! My absolute favorite! Their homemade jam and hot sauce are wonderful as well. 
Staff are very friendly and attentive. There was one instance where we went to have breakfast before an outing at the Cleveland Zoo with my niece, my sister, brother-in-law and boyfriend...total of 5... As our orders were ready, our waiter would bring them out (not everybody's would be ready at the same time), well everyone got their orders but me, unfortunately mine somehow got lost in the shuffle of everyday business or whatever but they apologized profusely, got my order AND gave me a $20 gift card for the mistake. I appreciated their reconciliation in the matter. They have me as a lifelong customer. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised that I have not seen this actively mentioned in the comments below - the prices are very steep.

We had the pumpkin French toast special and the gingerbread waffles, side of sausage and side of bacon, one coffee and one large OJ - total $48.  With the tip it, out the door cost a little shy of $60 ... for breakfast.  OK ... I'll say it ... that's absurd!

All the main items on the brunch menu, including the granola, exceeded $11 with most items in the $13-$14 range ... and this is without a side protein either.

Was the food good?  Answer - yes.  Can I taste and discern the quality of fresh, local items - yes.  Service:  service was fine - no gripes here yet it was basic ... took the order ... dropped off the drinks ... dropped off the food and cleared the table when finished.  Rather simple in my eyes.

I have not been to Lucky's in a few years.  We had chores in Tremont and first tried Grumpy's on this Sat. around 10:30 a.m.  Wait at Grumpy's was a half hour.  Tried Lucky's on a whim ... immediate seating.  It was crowded yet seats were available.

Customers talk about how Lucky's does not except any substitutions, requests, etc.  I personally feel that if I'm dropping $15 on French toast, an establishment needs to seriously consider excepting requests, etc.  I get it though as I think the size of the kitchen prohibits requests ... there just is no prep room.

In the end:
Would I go here again ... yes, but probably in a very, very long time.

Would I recommend this place to others ... yes, but with the major caveat ... the prices.  Just expect a per person ring of probably $20 per person."}
{"text":"The best place for brunch in Cleveland. I am moving and will miss this place. The waffles are amazing - as most of the items are awesome."}
{"text":"MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.

What type of restaurant doesn't allow any substitutions?  I'll tell you what kind...the kind that has a LAZY kitchen staff that pre-makes or \"buys in\" their ingredients and menu items and doesn't make anything fresh or to-order.  Don't want cheese on your Shipwreck?  Tough shit.  The egg mixture is already pre-made.  My boyfriend ordered the macaroni and cheese.  For $12.50 I was expecting the best m & c we've ever had.  Nope.  Not satisfied with his choice he picked up a cinnamon and hazelnut scone on the way out the door.  It was stale.  Go figure--why wouldn't it be stale?  My curried chicken salad was loaded with chunks of canned (yes CANNED) chicken.  It tasted good but seriously?  Charging $12.50 for canned chicken?  And the potato chips on the side were nothing more than greasy Lay's potato chips.  This place gets my vote for most overrated and biggest ripoff I've been to in years.  Service is horrible.  Our waitress couldn't have cared less that we were there.  I was so impressed with her that I left a paltry $1 bill on the table for her.  We won't go back and I encourage people who want a good breakfast/brunch whatever the hell they call it to avoid this place.  There are much better breakfast /brunch options (see:  Johnny Mango, Tremont Tap House, Gypsy Beans and Bakery, and Clifton Diner) to waste your time and money on this joint.  The owner should be embarrassed.  As a small business, you need to over-deliver, and this place falls dramatically short."}
{"text":"Excellent place for brunch. It gets very busy after 10am, so make sure to arrive early!"}
{"text":"Amazing. We went after watching on Guy Fierri show. Decided to make Cleveland
 a destination with first stop Luckys. Had to try the Reuben, it was delicious! Living in NY area, have had lots of delicious Ruebens but Luckys was different and the best! Corned beef cooked to perfection and not thinly sliced from a slicer. more like pulled from brisket, not too much either so you tasted all the flavor of the meat, homemade sauerkraut and homemade dressing and homemade bread! Also had the Bisquits and sausage gravy. Again unique to most, usually most sausage gravy is too salty, theirs was perfect and the Bisquits amazing.  The manager , waiter and we even got to meet the Chef were so welcoming!! If in the area we highly recommend it"}
{"text":"delish and nutrish. massive breakfast portions with farm fresh ingred in a funky cleveland neighborhood. loved it"}
{"text":"Very fresh, all local ingredients. Pretty expensive as far as breakfast goes but the food comes out incredibly fast - probably because the meals can't be modified in anyway which is a little annoying but the breakfast is very good. Expect to have to wait for a table it's always busy."}
{"text":"The food here is really tasty.  You know how they say that if you're looking to eat the right amount, eat half of what you are served at a restaurant? Eat a third here, it's really heavy stuff.  
The biscuits and gravy are sooo good. They're not really all that authentic, because they're all souped up with stuff other than biscuits and sausage gravy, but they're incredible.  I've also had the Shipwreck and the pecan bacon, both of which are unique and delicious.  The Canoewreck makes this place vegetarian friendly. The latte I ordered was huge but really good too, good quality espresso and creamy frothed milk. If you're not careful, you will go home and pass out after eating here, it puts you in the ultimate food coma.  It's also kind of pricey; I can understand why, but it's not somewhere I'd make a habit out of going. More like a \"hey my parents are in town and want to go to brunch\" kind of place.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I love the locavor movement , and to date Lucky's cafe is,  by far,the best example I have encountered. Can you PUHLEEEZE expand to Buffalo??...I'm BEGGIN here!"}
{"text":"The shipwreck is dangerously delicious and the comotoast (which I thought was a play on words) can be summed up as super buttery carb goodness.

If you come at the right time for breakfast (read - early) you can get seated quite fast and won't have to wait. The dining area is on the small side but I love the atmosphere.

The servers are friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and always have good suggestions. I believe everything (almost) that they serve is locally sourced - right down to the bagels. I had an iced coffee that may have been called \"Heather's Drink\" - and it was delish!

It's definitely a trendy breakfast spot and I shall return again and again."}
{"text":"Important to note: We came on a Sunday, they start serving food at 9:00 am. 

The service was great! Everyone was very attentive. I liked the feel of the place because it felt like a little community spot. Very cute & quaint! I love how it is stashed away in the neighborhood.

This was our first time in Cleveland. We were here for the Cavaliers vs Pacers Game 7! Go CAVS! The husband and I arrived at 8:30 am. We got a coffee and hot chocolate as we waited.

Once it was 9:00 am, they promptly started taking orders. I ordered the Baked Mac & Cheese with apple sauce and grapes. The husband ordered the Omelet with potatoes and fruit and also ordered the Pecan Bacon. 

The apple sauce is great!  For me Mac & Cheese can get really heavy and the apple sauce breaks it up in between bites. My husband was very happy with his omelet. You can tell the freshness of the ingredients since it is a farm to table cafe. The pecan bacon was really nicely made, tasted like candied bacon that would go really well in a Bloody Mary. 

It was the perfect start to our day!"}
{"text":"I ate here for breakfast last week during a visit to Las Vegas. The breakfast was reasonably priced (for a location on the Strip) and the service was fast and attentive. I loved their pancakes and the location is convenient if you are inside of the Stratosphere."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in at Lucky's on our way out of Cleveland.  We go two sandwiches to go.  It was busy on Sunday at 1 PM.  We ordered and the young lady at the counter was really friendly.  We sat on the bench in front of the counter to wait.  We waited and waited.  We saw a bag come out and someone place it on top of one of the coffee makers.  No one even looked at it.  Finally after waiting another 10 minutes, my husband finaly asked about our order.  The young woman said \"Someone just went to check on it in the kitchen\".  Low and behold....our order had been sitting on the coffee maker for well over 10 minutes.  That meant, the rueben was soggy.  We got our tea (which hadn't been poured) and took our bag.  The food is really good.  The rueben, aside from being soggy, was tasty.  They do need to put it together a bit more \"evenly\".  One side was piled with corned beef, the other, had very little.  We tore the sandwich apart and rebuilt it.  The potato salad is just like homemade....well seasoned and good firm potatoes.  The curried chicken salad was also very good.  The bread was a bit dry, but good.  Food gets an A.  Service dropped it a bit."}
{"text":"I went to Cleveland for 3 days and this cafe was the highlight of my trip! The food here was amazing!!! The staffing was amazing!!! Everything was amazing!! I went here for breakfast and I got the waffles and they were the best waffles I've ever had! I also got their cookies to go, but they were alright."}
{"text":"Okay, so the place is cute, quiet very chill! I order the Spinach salad which was a great great size!! Love their portion, special when most places give out portions that make you think you're being pranked! The reason why I'm giving it a 3 is because I was not happy with their service they could've been more attentive to me considering it was 10am, they were not busy , and all I wanted was a side of dry wheat toast which by the time they brought it I was done with my meal!!!!"}
{"text":"Great little place!  We were welcomed very warmly and treated great!  Had the best Rueben I've ever had...a wonderful sweetness.  Go to Lucky's... You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Takes the top rating!   Went for Lunch \"brunch\" on Saturday at noon.  3 adults and 2 kids got right in, even though their place is tiny.    The service here is top notch.  They have quite a few people helping, but they appropriately check in on you, and you can tell how much every person loves working there and cares!
  Now the food, had the spicy sweet potato soup with homemade creme fresh...WOW  I can't wait to figure out how to make this at home.   Homemade Mac n Cheese- White!  Tried it with a little of Lucky's homemade hot sauce too.  Also had the Pecan Bacon...which I had one bite of DH's and it might have been my favorite.  EVERY THING we ate we LOVED!
 DH had a \"papa mocha\" and he really enjoyed it, unlike big coffee giants, he said they used a really nice coffee and added the chocolate....so it was a perfect blend.  
  I had a berry soda made with homemade berry coulis and pellegrino.  2 of those!  
  Our food sort of came out all staggered, I noticed but wasn't bothered...but one of the mgrs came right over and apologized, offered another berry soda on the house and free treats from the dessert case for the 2 kids!  
  I can't wait to go back, and would send anyone I know there!   
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ohh my. Love this place....Im a fan of Nick's Diner but Lucky's gives them a run for there money. Love the bakery/restaurant set up. Very friendly staff and no wait whatsoever for a table. Its a little bigger than Nicks which helps. Love the location in Tremont too.

Get the waffles.....you will not be disappointed...trust me. You could eat them just using the whipped cream they put on top. Server offered us pecan bacon..I was a little miffed at 1st until I actually tried it...my goodness its good. I could eat that alone by itself and be happy. Pick up a few bakery items before you leave also.

Looking for a good breakfast...try Lucky's if you havent"}
{"text":"Will try again. 
Open at 8 on Saturday but do not begin service until 9. 
Looks great but I need breakfast now."}
{"text":"Shipwreck
Breakfast Burritos
Baked Mac & Cheese

Go and order all three, share with friends, and thank me later.."}
{"text":"I'm torn between giving this place 3 and 4 stars.  The service was great and the wait time was good despite it being packed to the gills.   The food came out really fast and overall I was happy with everything else except my food.   I ordered the biscuits and gravy, but I'm not a fan of eggs do I asked them to hold it.   I think in the end the biscuits were a bit too hard for me.  My food was just ok.  My daughter on the other hand had the baked mac and cheese which I tried and loved.   I'm not sure if my food wasn't good because of how I ordered it, or if that is just how it's normally made but overall I wasn't pleased by the food which is a shame because everything was so good."}
{"text":"The service was a little slow, but the staff were super friendly and the restaurant is designed modern and very clean! When you walk in you see all the coffee, and baked goods which are delicious.  The menu is small but as you see with other reviews the Biscuits and sausage meal was devine! I do not usually eat gravy but this gravy was delicious! The sausage mixed in with the eggs and homemade biscuit really made this place worth the 5 hour drive, distinctly unique and fresh! Sophi had the Waffles which where homemade and delicious as well.  I can only help to try there Burgers and Mac and Cheese sometime! When your there make sure to take in the atmosphere and the outside of the restaurant where the picnic tables and the garden are!"}
{"text":"The coffee was good and service was pretty good.  The food is fresh.  Unfortunately, their food is average.  There are things I like in each of the dishes, however none of them made me say \"I want to come back for this\".  Also it kinda sucks that some of the menu items can't be personalized.  The food is a little on the bland side as well."}
{"text":"I love this place! It has a unique menu. They make and locally grow many of their ingredients such as the hot sauce and jam. The jam is delicious and I would recommend trying the fizzy drinks. The mac & cheese with the applesauce is my favorite course that I get every single time. The fruit on the menu tastes fresh. It is more expensive and definitely a treat."}
{"text":"UNDERWHELMED! My much-better-half and I visited today for Brunch.... we both wished we picked someplace else. I don't understand all the \"great\" reviews....in our opinion, it was barely passible. I had the Shipwreck and my wife had the Tuna Croissant sandwich. The former is a ...err... amalgam of overcooked scrambled eggs, yukon gold potato chunks, a few onions, a smidge of cheese and a tablespoon of bacon, served with overdone toast. The tuna was very ordinary served on a so-so croissant...with potato salad on the side (which is an odd accompaniement to a tuna sandwich, due to the similarity in textures.) We had coffees with our meal. (Coffee was good.) Price (before tip) was $26.50! Which is a lot for quality and quantity. Not half-full Saturday at 12:30pm. Service was pleasant. I was disappointed after reading the rave reviews, but it's not worth the trip or the price. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Our Unlucky Experience (I'm so sorry for that)

At Lucky's Café they do a \"15 minute call ahead service\" which is their version of a reservation. We did this 15 minutes before we arrived and the woman on the phone took our name and said that we were good to go. When we arrive, the waitress greets us and we say that we made a 15 minute call ahead reservation. She says \"there is no call ahead today.\" There were open tables, so it didn't really matter because we were seated immediately anyway. It's just not a good sign when within 5 seconds of entering a restaurant your waitress basically accuses you of lying. If we said we did the \"call ahead\" thing, then either someone from your restaurant told us that, or we were lying.

I ordered the Lucky Burger which comes with cole slaw and chips. 10 minutes after ordering it, the waitress returns and says that they are out of slaw. That's fine. I completely understand that sometimes restaurants run out of things (although it was noon, so their planning wasn't great). The thing that annoyed us was the waitress not offering to replace the slaw with anything. I asked if the slaw could be replaced with something, and she said, \"I don't think so.\" What the heck!? I get less food but play the same price! After asking again, she said that they could only replace the slaw that THEY RAN OUT OF and comes with the burger with MORE CHIPS. This being my only option, I took it - a burger with 2 sides of chips.

When the burger and our other food arrived, it looked and smelled great. However, the burger was WAY too salty. I had a friend try it to make sure it wasn't just me. She agreed.

Besides the salty burger and bad service, we also had questions about the flyer on the table. It read that Lucky's is committed to supporting Ohio farms and want to \"showcase\" their products. This was strange seeing that none of the fruit our plates could have possibly come from Ohio farms. I know that fruits and veggies in Ohio are limited during this part of the year, but in California, if you say something like that, you can bet that at least 90% of their food is actually locally grown. This wasn't a big issue, and we might have only discussed it because we were annoyed at the service (plus one of our party is in the culinary business).

The final straw that led to a $1 tip was when the waitress came over to us when two of our party were actively eating with half of their food left and asked, \"do you want a box for that?\" I understand that your restaurant is small and you want to serve as many people as possible, but don't try to rush us out when we still have piles of food on our plates and we have forks in our hands.

I will not be coming back to Lucky's again."}
{"text":"Breakfast burrito was cold inside. I asked for it to be put back in the oven for a couple minutes, but they insisted on making a whole new one. Not much warmer than the first, but what are you gonna do? Nothing special considering the high prices. Pastries did look good in the case up front."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place, but so does everybody else! The wait is super long on the weekends so I suggest eating during the week if you can. I always get the bacon with the whatever crusted on it and it's amazing. And the waffles are great! Try the seasonal drinks too! Everything here is awesome and I would eat here every week if I could afford it."}
{"text":"Everything here is locally grown and homemade. I had the Ohio Corn Griddle Cakes with blueberry compote, lemon curd drizzle, fresh whipped cream and sliced sweet almonds.  Amazing!"}
{"text":"Went this morning (Monday) and there was absolutely no wait.  I read some reviews about bad service but that was not the case this morning.  Our server was very sweet and attentive and our food arrived very quickly.  The breakfast itself was delicious.  The fresh ingredients make it that much better.  We ordered the Shipwrecked and a breakfast burrito.  Both were great. 

I'd give Lucky's five starts except I feel like it was very overpriced for breakfast.  I understand they are local and grow their own veggies, but almost $40 for two people for breakfast is crazy!  It was eggs, veggies, potatoes and toast!  The whole appeal of breakfast is that it's quick and cheap.  So while the food was good, I can't see going here on a regular basis.  It's good for a special occasion."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY!!! The food was AWFUL, and the service was weird. allow me to elaborate.
food- i got the california omelet with an english muffin. english muffin literally burned to a crisp, omelet OVERFLOWING with spinach that was most likely previously frozen. BF got chicken and waffles. chicken so greasy you could strap them to your feet and use them like ice skates on the tile floor, waffles crunchy like a potato chip. 
Service- wheres the fire? waiters and waitresses literally RUNNING around everywhere except to their tables. at one point a salty old broad threw down the silverware she was holding and shouted the f word and ran to the back. other waiters and waitresses snapping at one another, super awkward. 
we eventually had to demand our check and ran out as quickly as possible. be warned, the room service food comes from the same place. ew."}
{"text":"God I love this place. I'm not a biscuits and gravy guy at all but the biscuits and gravy at Lucky's are killer. This is what a hole-in-the-wall brunch should be, affordable, tasty, and fun. The only bad part is that it's very hard to find seating because of how popularity and and how small the restaurant is."}
{"text":"Lucky's Cafe is one of my favorite places in Tremont! The food is amazing!!! I have not had the baked mac n' cheese but I hear it is amazing. I have been there for breakfast and it is worth the price. Everything is fresh and I believe local.  It is a cafe style restaurant so the service is good for that setting. The best part about the place is that it is dog friendly. It is a close walk from anywhere in Tremont. I highly recommend making the trip your taste buds will thank you!"}
{"text":"So my wife saw this place on tv and wanted to give it a shot. Two problems:1) Most of the places I have been to solely because I saw them on tv have generally been, well, not good. 2) I really dislike Guy Fieri. I dislike him enough to not even make sure I spelled his name right. 

Anyway, despite my reservations, we stopped in. The verdict? Better than expected, but nothing great. 

First off, I should have read some reviews... they do not start table service until 9. Not a big deal, we arrived at quarter till. Waitress gets to the table and gives the whole farm to table, locally sourced stuff... blah blah, I want to eat. Menu is limited, so I get the biscuits and my wife gets the granola. She also had a smoothie that was pretty good... I had the coffee, also good. Grub was good, if pricey. And even though I zoned out on the waitress during her hippie speech, she was pretty attentive. 

I guess this review in a nutshell is that Lucky's has good, expensive food, a limited menu, weird hours and tasty drinks.

May return for coffee, probably not for breakfast."}
{"text":"This review is almost 2 years overdue. That said, this place has one of the best breakfast meals I've ever had. I felt like I gained approximately 5 pounds after each meal but it was well worth it. Shamazing!!"}
{"text":"Very popular on a Sunday morning. Service was pleasant and super friendly   Everything on the menu looked delicious. Service was busy but as attentive as could be. The portions were generous. Vegan and cleaner eating options."}
{"text":"Lucky's is great for breakfast/brunch! They make everything from scratch and try to use all local ingredients, some of which they grow right out back. The biscuits and gravy are amazing and they usually have great seasonal specials like pumpkin pancakes! I have had the mac and cheese, yes for breakfast :), and it is really really good although rich! The pecan covered bacon is one of the best things on the menu, i would recommend sharing it as a side because, for me, it is too sweet to have more than one piece! 

All of their coffee is fantastic especially the Lucky's latte with honey. I have tried to recreate this at other coffee places but it is never the same. I also am a sucker for french press coffee so it is nice that they offer it here. 

The service is pretty good but it is such a small place and they are VERY busy on the weekends so their servers are usually running around like crazy. 

This is a great place to bring out of town guests or to have sunday brunch after a night out."}
{"text":"These people would rather serve you something that will make you sick than accommodate your food allergy.  
Don't even bother going.
I can understand not wanting to cater to the pain in the butt people that want to substitute everything (then just eat at home), but for God sakes don't discriminate against the food allergies!  
The word for me is boycott."}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast spot. Very small, so get there early or be prepared to wait. 
We ordered the biscuits & gravy which was amazing! I'm not usually one to mix all my food together, but did not mind the eggs under the gravy on this dish.
We also ordered the special one weekend of the squash spaetzle which was one of the best dishes I've ever had in my life. The combination of the sweet and savory with rich eggs was phenomenal! The server shared it takes them 12-18 hours to make this so it is a rare special, but if they had this on the menu all the time, I'd be making frequent early morning drives to Cleveland!  Be prepared to spend more than usual on your typical breakfast, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Lucky's is my fav place to get breakfast/brunch in Cleveland.  Tucked into a residential neighborhood it is cute, friendly and just as tasty as you'll find.  I've been there a number of times and love the vegetarian Canoewreck is my usual go to choice -- it is so delish.  You carnivores should give it a whirl.   I always want to venture out and get something new but I love it.  Now, let it be know that I've tasted lots of things my friends have ordered and everything I've tried is awesome.  Last time I tasted the Bruleed Steel Cut Oatmeal -- bruleed oatmeal with fruit topping and these unusual and fab spinach + cheese eggs and toast.  I sooo wanna get that next time...maybe we should head there for breakfast tomorrow!  This place has staff that are friendly and know their menu very well.  The coffee is great, they have beer and other beverages.  This place uses local produce some from their own garden as much as they are able plus other supporting other local and organic food products.  We had a breakfast brunch celebration one visit and we called and ordered ahead a birthday fruit tart to end the meal with candles and all.  It was beautiful and yummy so keep in mind they have awesome pastries and bakery items, too.  On a warm day we love to sit outside at their picnic tables where there is full service dining.  Love this place -- hope you get to enjoy it soon, too!"}
{"text":"I happened to cross paths with Luckys one Sunday morning and was happy I tried it out.  I enjoyed seeing the staff pick the fresh herbs from their garden.  Small but good breakfast spot."}
{"text":"If you happen to have a tuning fork somewhere in your rumpus room, pick it up, find a hard surface and strike it.    Now hold it up to your ear.    Hear that tone?   It's perfect.  It hits a nerve.    
That was my experience at Lucky's Cafe.    From beginning to end, a magical experience.   

We were in town for a wedding and were seeking a local place to grab some breakfast before heading for home and thanks to my fellow Yelpers, I found Lucky's not eight minutes from our hotel.   Nestled in a quirky neighborhood which reminded me a bit of Mass. Ave. or Broad Ripple here in Indy, I was getting some warm fuzzies as we pulled up.   The host was extremely friendly and gave us some good-natured teasing as we entered.   

We were seated quickly, which was a nice surprise and after ordering our drinks we took a quick tour of the gardens.   Talk about fresh choices - we were just steps away from the produce that would eventually make it to our table.   Tomatoes and peppers and herbs, oh my.   I was envious of the gardens, to be sure. 

Our server, also perfect for this restaurant, was passionate about the place and treated us like regulars.  We had two kids in tow, and treated them with patience, too.  That's important to parents.   

The food, oh, the food.   So delicious.  It just made you feel good to eat it, knowing you were enjoying fresh ingredients.   My wife and I split the Shipwreck: A heaping plate of eggs, cheese, veggies, hash browns and bacon.   Easily shareable.  
The girls split a delicious waffle with some outrageous toppings.   No complaints there!  

Lucky's Cafe is one of those places I wish we had around the corner.   If you live in Cleveland, if you are going to visit Cleveland or anywhere within about a five hour drive please take it upon yourself to visit this example of what can happen when we eschew the norm and support local businesses."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this cafe for my trip to Ohio and I was not let down. Very cute cafe with a great, welcoming atmosphere and staff. Super yummy vegan options. Would definitely come back to this spot if revisit Ohio!"}
{"text":"I consider myself a connoisseur of macaroni and cheese (see Yelp nickname).  So, it is with legitimate authority that I say Lucky's mac and cheese is one of the very best I have ever had--and I've had alot, considering I ALWAYS order it when it's on a menu.  The gingerbread waffles didn't live up to the mac and cheese deliciousness, but my husband was a big fan of them.  Cute environment, local ingredients--all in all, a great find!"}
{"text":"Guys, I swear that I am not a picky person, and that I feel comfortable in a wide variety of settings, from dive bars to swanky restaurants. I was pretty excited (momentarily) when my husband and I walked into Lucky's for breakfast on Good Friday and it reminded me of one of the cool little cafes that I would frequent when I lived in Seattle. The excitement ended pretty swiftly. We were greeted by the hostess/waitress who haughtily informed us that, although they opened at 7, were not able to offer breakfast yet because the kitchen didn't open until 9 (huh?!) It was 8:30 at that point so we decided to order some coffee and wait the thirty minutes. After all, the Yelp reviews were great and we had travelled a fair distance.

As we waited, more and more people piled in. We perused the menu and were somewhat taken aback that there were only about six items for breakfast, none of which cost less than $14. We surmised that the coffees we sipped on were an omen of the delicious breakfast to come and that it would totally be worth it -- my husband's latte was probably the best we've ever had, and even the drip coffee was excellent for this admitted coffee snob (hey, once you live in Seattle it becomes an obsession!) We were waiting in anxious anticipation to order our food. By the time 9:00 rolled around the dining room was basically full and the lone server was running around like a chicken with her head cut off. The only other person working there was pretty much chained to the coffee bar because she was trying to frantically fill all of the coffee orders. The server took our order second, as we were the second people there that morning, but a part of the ordering process is listening to this really long, canned speil about how they're farm to table and yadda yadda yadda. The dining room is small and her voice is enormous, so once she said it to the first couple I felt like it probably sufficed for the rest of the diners. However, we had to hear it again probably fifteen different times throughout the course of breakfast. It was kind of comical at first but then it became rather annoying.

My husband ordered the shipwreck, which is a big egg scramble that comes with toast. I ordered the canoe wreck, which is a vegan scramble with curried tofu and sounded delicious. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. We saw lots of breakfasts coming out of the kitchen, to people who ordered after us. Just as we were trying to flag the server down to inquire what the hold up for our breakfast was, she appeared at our table looking frantic with two heaping plates in her arms. She set the shipwreck down in front of my husband, and set an identical looking plate down in front of me. \"Ok I messed up your order and just put it in for you but here you can eat this until it's ready,\" she blurted out to me in a hurried and breathless voice. \"What is this?\" I inquired. Well, it was another shipwreck. I told her that we couldn't wait any longer and to cancel the canoe wreck (we had other things we had to do in Cleveland that morning and we were already running behind because of all the waiting) and I disappointedly picked at the eggy monstrosity put before me. I'm not actually a vegan, but this would have been an even more frustrating experience had I been. Don't get me wrong, the shipwreck was OK, but it was not at all what I wanted that morning. I tend to not order egg dishes when I go out for breakfast because how easy is that to prepare for yourself at home!? I'm pretty sure I could make several shipwrecks at home for the $14 that it costs to eat one at Lucky's. 

My husband ate about half of his breakfast and we decided to move on. As I said, it was OK, but we really didn't want to hear that \"farm to table\" speil again and the place was so crowded that it was becoming uncomfortably loud. We went to the coffee bar area to pay and again had to wait a painfully long time (maybe 10 minutes?) because, still, the other woman working was chained to the espresso machine and had her back to the counter the entire time. This is also the waiting area for people hoping to get a table, so we felt like crushed sardines. After several unsuccessful attempts, my husband finally managed to get her attention and we received our check. For two breakfasts, one latte, and one drip coffee, we paid $42. They didn't take my botched breakfast off of the check, and it would have taken such a Hurculean effort to argue the point because of how busy they were that we decided our time was worth more than the $14, so we paid the check and left. 

TL;DR: go to Lucky's and get a latte, then drive over to Slyman's for breakfast. You will be so much more satisfied and you'll probably pay about 1/2 of what you would otherwise."}
{"text":"I can't speak to the whole menus as I've only had the mac & cheese, but it was delicious!

My only complaint would be the service. My boyfriend ordered a special and they brought him out the wrong meal. Our waitress was slow and inattentive despite the fact that the restaurant was not busy at the time. I ordered one of their pastries as an appetizer and we never received it.

The food is good if you have the patience for slow staff."}
{"text":"Fortunately, we avoided the crowd when we went, since we went on a Friday morning for brunch. Unfortunately, the menu was a little smaller compared to their weekend brunch. I tried to order something that they offer on the weekends (vegetarian burrito), but they said they couldn't do it. Sad that they weren't very accommodating.

I liked the fact that they used mostly local, organic ingredients here, and the fact that they were BYOB. It's super cool that they grow their veggies in their backyard! A few members of our group went to get champagne at a store next door, and we ordered orange juice to make mimosas.

I got the waffles, and the bf got canoewreck. The waffles were very good, with the sweet caramel and whipped cream contrasted with the sour, tangy rhubarb compote. The canoewreck was amazing, with curried tofu and veggies.

Overall, the food was good. One thing that was less than ideal was the temperature. I don't know if their air conditioning was broken (or if they even had air conditioning), but I swear it felt like 90 degrees in there. Everyone in our party was sweating, especially after eating warm food. It kind of made us feel a bit sick, as it was also about 105 degrees outside."}
{"text":"Let me start with the great: the waffles are AMAZING.  The food is local and in some cases, grown in the backyard.  The beverages (coffee and teas) are very tasty - and the selection is vast.  The severs are friendly.

The good: Everything tastes fresh.  

The bad: The price (wow).  The limited selection (as far as food goes - I find it weird to have more beverage selections than food selections, but that's just me).  The fact that you have to ask for salt, pepper, ketchup (and then you bring one tiny glop of ketchup - I don't care about having a fancy cup - I just want some Heinz ketchup!).  Overall the service was lacking - I had to ask a random waiter to get some water and coffee refills were very slow.  

Overall though, the good/great really did outweigh the bad.  I would go back if I'm ever in Cleveland again - which is not really something that I'm hoping for anytime soon."}
{"text":"Such a cute little cafe! Amazing customer service and the best biscuits and gravy I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"This place is a great place to go for brunch.  I have been there twice was impressed both times.  

Your eyes fill with lust as you watch each plate coming out of the kitchen which increases the difficulty of coming to a decision about what to order.  I had corned beef hash (which was a daily special) on my first visit and it was amazing.  

We just went here last Sunday and it appeared to be packed.  A dozen or more people were waiting outside.  I was surprised when I was told that it would be only twenty minutes for a table.

I'm not a huge coffee/espresso drinker, but my wife is and she loves their coffee drinks."}
{"text":"If you are looking for brunch in Cleveland, this is the best option! This place is absolutely killer! Go here, get a side of the Pecan Bacon, and enjoy it. It's the best!"}
{"text":"Indifferent service, freezing dining room, and way overpriced food...$13 for granola? Seriously? I think the lack of options for breakfast/lunch is the only reason this survives."}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp and loved it. The eggs benedict was the best I've every had, and the staff was incredibly friendly and attentive. They are a little pricey ($12-17 for an entrée at brunch) but absolutely worth every penny."}
{"text":"Ambiance: 4. Lucky's is nestled in a quaint, quiet part of Cleveland's Tremont neighborhood.  Inside is small and intimate with approximately a dozen table's total, but not very memorable.  However, their outside patio hosts several picnic tables, adjacent to their in-season garden. Win.

Cost: 2. Having most ingredients from scratch or local apparently equates to being able to charge more than most other Cleveland breakfast places. Hard to come here and NOT get at least a breakfast beverage or two, pastries, plus an entrée. So you're looking at ~$20 a head for breakfast/brunch.

Food Quality: 5. I've tried two-thirds+ of their standard brunch menu and some specials, can honestly say everything is great. For sweet, the waffles, oatmeal, and pecan bacon top the list without question. Oatmeal- incredible upgrade from the standard, essentially feels like crème brulee plus a side of baked eggs. Savory, the biscuits as others mention are indeed incredible, but not for everyone. Breakfast Burritos and Shipwreck for those preferring more \"standard\" breakfast affair while remaining awesome choices. Mac N' Cheese and Reuben are good but both very heavy options, so consider yourself warned of a likely food coma. Drinks also top notch with attention to detail across smoothies, coffees/teas, and sodas.

Service: 5. Service is always prompt and courteous. Long wait times tend to go fast.  No waiting for your check either- each table can pay at counter when ready, saving table turnover time.

When to return: Showing off the best of Cleveland's brunch choices. Summertime to sit on the patio. Winter for a warm coffee beverage and pastry's. Small-to-medium-sized groups (large parties may struggle here aside from outside picnic benches)."}
{"text":"Mine is the 611th review for this place.  What can I say that hasn't been said already?  This place is as good as the 600+ reviews before me say it is, and the food and beverage taste as good as the photos look. 

An absolutely charming place.  No one, from anywhere in the world, will be disappointed here."}
{"text":"Cute place with friendly waiters and a great eco-friendly business mission to use fresh & local farm products. I absolutely love everything I have had at Lucky's. I always order the same thing (cut oatmeal & spinach & cream and the occasional Chocolate mousse bomb). Each time the food is just as good as the previous, so an A for the consistency. Their corn beef is also fantastically soft and tasty, highly recommend that. 

So why not give them a 5-star? First, their menu is pretty small. There are only about 10 entree options, while some aren't that special considering the higher price compared to other brunch places. Also the wait is quite ridiculous. This is a very popular place and the waiting area is always packed, making it extra loud in the cafe and creating a walking hazard around the check-out area which is also where people order coffee/dessert! Maybe they can look into adding a free phone-app for people to make reservations in advance. 

Overall, still my favorite brunch place in Cleveland with lots of potential to be even better!"}
{"text":"I visited with a friend on a Friday around 12PM and we had a nice experience. This was my first time visiting Lucky's and I definitely foresee many visits in the future. 

Since it was our first time our server explained the menu to us, the concept, how they grow a lot of their veggies right outside and more. 

I ordered the mac & cheese because I vaguely remember reading good things about it. It definitely did not disappoint and it was delicious. I had to take some home because it was a lot of food but he was even good reheated. 

Prices were a bit higher but for having fresh food, I am fine with it. Server was a little pushy on ordering but still nice. 

I'll definitely be back but I think I'd avoid on weekends if I could and do a weekday visit."}
{"text":"You have to understand : my fiancée and I had just spent two days being terrorized and then rejected from heading into Maryland by Blizzard Neptune or whatever, endured a meal at a packed Ruby Tuesday in Somerset, PA (It was so packed. So weird.) and were basically dying for an upside.

We found the uppest side there ever could be. Squash Petzales are so surprising and delicious I'd have thought Bongo Room finally found a worthy competitor (Chicago's dominant breakfast champion). Papa Mocha was basically me ordering dessert first, and I had to stop drinking and take it to go it was so rich. I had the biscuits and they killed. Sausage gravy with some green onions...pretty sure that's a Marvin Gaye song too.

Seated quick bc we called ahead, Lisa I think was our waitress and she was helpful and far from pushy, super kind.

All in all it made us believe in Cleveland's cool even more fully, their Round Up program should be in every major city, and most of all : PECAN. BACON. You cannot imagine it, you have to experience it. But if you look at it too long you lose eyesight. So it's basically an eclipse. Of your whole damn life."}
{"text":"Boatwreck was surprisingly delicious. Didn't know tofu with curry powder in general, let alone for breakfast, could taste this good. Next time in Cleveland I will make sure to stop back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the Reuben is delicious. Even at $15, it's worth the price, and is worth a trip to Lucky's all by itself. There's no sandwich that compares in Cleveland, and it's worth 2-3 stars alone.

However, the rest of the Lucky's experience leaves a bit to be desired. The food is good. Well above-average, even. But to wait in a line for an hour, and pay the price point that Lucky commands... I'm over it. There are plenty of other places within walking distance for comparable (if not better) food, at a more competitive price range. 

And worst of all, I've come to Lucky's a few times for my 2:00pm coffee, and I'm amazed by the short cuts they take with their coffee service. Ask for a latte, and you'll get a \"shot\" of espresso from a pre-made cup sitting on their coffee maker. When was it brewed? Who knows. The milk is steamed quickly, and poured, and the frothing mug is left on the counter (for the next person, perhaps?). I'd say its because they're too busy, but this is what to expect even when there's nobody in line to pay. This special drink will run you just shy of $4. 

If this is standard practice for a place that's supposed to be as good as Lucky's, it makes me wonder what else they'll do to save time."}
{"text":"I recently had my sister see this restaurant on Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives.  I was told the \"Reuben\" was looking very good on the show.  I'm sorry to say, but I later \"found out\" off the Luck's website, ... that Guy Fieri last visited in 2009.  Evidently, my sister saw a rerun.  That is crazy old for a rerun?  Oh well, so it goes.  

Unfortunately we both got the Reuben.  I strongly feel the sandwich changed since 2009.   We understand all things change.  The Reuben was a tad under $15, and it came with the hard kettle chips.  The Reuben had  \"\"\"very\"\"\" little meat, and really greasy bread that was lightly browned.  The dressing for the Reuben was a 5.  The Kraut was a 5.  But this Reuben was not at all worth $15.  OMG R U Kidding?  Where was the meat?  At least weigh it?  

I invited a friend to specifically go to Lucky's Cafe to get this recommended Reuben.  We went on a Wednesday just after 1pm.  We had a small wait.  Once seated we got 5 star service.  I gotta say, the service was over the top.  Thank you for that!  It helped ease the visit by far.

I later called to ask if I could let them know rather than YELP.  I got sent to their email on the website.  Really?   I didn't get much of a \"sorry about that\" over the phone.  That's why I'm here.   Of course I picked up the tab since I invited a great friend.  But I really had to pay since it was my idea \"and\" a flop in the pan meal wise.  We both said \"well maybe they are a breakfast place\".   I hear they are....
*****It is back to the Superior Restaurant for the best Reuben in Cleveland*****"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Pecan bacon is like candy of the gods. Service was also spot on. Wish I lived closer, I'd be here all the time."}
{"text":"I was back in Cleveland to visit family, and really really glad I found Lucky's Cafe. We got there just before the rush (there was quite a wait as we left), and the server clearly helped us out with our time-crunch. Food was great, service was friendly without being over-bearing, and even though Guy Fieri apparently ate here, you should too."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Stopped in Cleveland on the way to and from vacation and had a phenomenal Sunday brunch twice here.  Everything we had was great - waffles with peaches, Vietnamese grinder, biscuts and gravy and oatmeal all were standouts.  Also make sure you get some of their homemade jam with your toast it is some of the best I have ever had.  
Service was a touch slow when we ate outside on the patio."}
{"text":"Lucky' ALWAYS gets a five star in my book. Our 27 year old son requests Lucky's every year for his birthday without fail. Their vanilla bean waffles are to die for!! No joke. When it gets cooler outside they change to gingerbread waffles. I do not like gingerbread cookies at all but these waffles are amazing!! You have to get there early and be prepared to wait but you will not be disappointed unless you want a plain Jane breakfast cuz this is not the place for that! Highly recommend Lucky's!!"}
{"text":"I had the most wonderful breakfast here on a short trip to Cleveland. I wish I could move to the Cleve just to be able eat here all the time! The atmosphere was so relaxing and nice and the staff were all very friendly. My coffee and waffle were both sooooo good. My mouth waters just thinking about them. I will certainly be stopping back here if I end up in town again."}
{"text":"Can we say YUM? Or to quote an annoying TV presence, \"YUM-O\"! Lucky's is a great place for brunch. Everything I have ever tasted here is delicious. This place reminded me of Chicago brunches, which are crucial to your weekends. The ingredients are local, natural and vegetarian friendly. A good cup o' Joe is always appreciated. 

As far as service goes, the cute waiter was pretty attentive to my constant requests for water and all my pressing questions. (Yeah, I'm a snob....either that or a foodie) Not a huge fan of the \"order at the counter\" craziness, hey I'm OCD & I like order....this is not orderly. I couldn't tell if I was supposed to seat myself or stand around like a moron & have someone else put me in a spot. 

Overall, a place not to be missed. Take your self on a brunch-date!"}
{"text":"The pictures on here don't even come close to doing it justice. Farm to table and freaking delicious!! Huge portions and you can literally taste the love in the food. Best brunch I've had in town!"}
{"text":"The best brunch in Cleveland! Thank you for offering your menu in Uber Eats. There isn't another brunch place I love more. Everything is made from scratch, carefully seasoned, and prepared with love. I won't say my favorite dish Because I would hate for them to run out. Oh and the como toast with preserves is excellent as well as the fresh squeezed OJ. Nothing compares- eating here really makes brunch feel deservedly decadent."}
{"text":"Five Stars. Probably #1 place I have ever been for Breakfast or lunch.  Everything is local, fresh, and made from scratch  Put this on your \"to do\" list next time you are in the Cleveland area.  

You will need to block off more time than your average cafe' because this place is so busy, you will have to wait a little while for a table (not an obscenely long wait, but a wait you would want to know up front). There are outside tables for the summer time."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Dallas and went to this restaurant for brunch on Sunday. The food was very good. The service was also very good. The food was a bit overpriced if you ask me though. We were charged an additional 3.95  just to have maple syrup with some waffles. That was a little disconcerting.   A bit expensive if you ask me. Brunch for two with coffee being about $55.

But if price doesn't bother you, the food is really good"}
{"text":"I really appreciated this quaint & hipster cafe! They are a fun place to go for brunch or lunch. Just note that selection may seem limited but you won't be disappointed with the food! 

I ordered the Shipwreck and my brother ordered the waffles. They were equally excellent! They use local ingredients so you can definitely taste the freshness. We also ordered the iced coffees which were yummy as well :)"}
{"text":"Corned beef was delicious, however my husbands turkey sandwich special was just so-so.  The homemade sparkling beverages were delish! Everything is homemade and I have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Lunch was good but I think I prefer their breakfast/brunch more.

We were in the Cleveland area again and decided to have lunch here. I went with the Reuben. I really dug their bread, it's fresh and made in house. I also really enjoyed the corned beef because it was \"chipped\" rather than a \"deli-slice\" which is what I am used to. The Thousand Island dressing is served on the side and it had a sweetness to it that I wasn't expecting. I'm guessing it doesn't come straight from a bottle like most places which is great. The only downside is that there wasn't enough sauerkraut. It was barely there, really. The sandwich came with some chips and I didn't care much for them only because I don't like chips all that much. I looked on the menu and didn't see any side substitutes. 

There were three of us and the bill (plus tip) came to $65. It was a little steep but knowing that the ingredients are fresh and made in house plus knowing we won't be back for a while made it worth it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere with super friendly & welcoming staff!  Food is outstanding:). Not typically a coffee drinker but love the cinnemon flavor added to their coffee!!"}
{"text":"This place is cute, don't get me wrong and it's dog friendly. The waiter seemed uninterested in helping up. Two of us were planning to order the salad, when we tried to order it he said they were out... 

Broccoli soup was a bland mush, it may have tasted better if they didn't puree it. 

The menu is small and nothing we ordered was amazing - lamb burger, turkey sandwich and chicken salad sandwich. My iced spiced chai was mostly milk, it barely tasted like chai and was white. 

5 out of 5 items were ordered were underwhelming. Cute spot though."}
{"text":"Last morning in Cleveland deserved a good breakfast. This place was features in the top food Network shows like diner drive in and dives. I got here about 10:30, it is very busy and loud, it's located in a nice little residential neighborhood and has a homie feel to it. The menu is just about right with great choices and a full coffee bar at your disposal. My waitress Opal was knowledgeable and friendly :) - I started with their lucky caramel and cream coffee, which was really good. The Corn Beef Hash was to put it simply the best I've ever had. The portion is HUGE! Even for me!? I would order this and share it with someone with a side of their pecon bacon. A must if you are nearby, absolute must. Why not five stars? Maybe because I dine alone I don't get that extra attention or little extra that really makes the visit go above and beyond. But a solid 4.8!"}
{"text":"I visited Lucky's while on a road trip to see the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with my dad and my brother. I scoped out the place because I saw it on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and it looked like my cup of tea.

We had to wait for a table for almost 40 minutes, but the weather was nice and the wait was expected since the place is tiny and we didn't come early enough, so we didn't mind.

We were seated outside which was awesome since we could see the garden they have there to grow all the veggies. I love how local the food is, and the quality shows!

I had the Canoewreck. Curried tofu, hashbrowns, lots of veggies, toast, and fruit. It was so delicious! The dudes were happy with what they ordered as well.

I'm sad I don't live near Cleveland because I'd eat here every day!"}
{"text":"Great place, nice atmosphere, price fair. Would recommend. Very clean with good service. Food came quickly and order was correct. Staff nice."}
{"text":"I just ate the most amazing, best-tasting biscuits & gravy in my life!"}
{"text":"I have only one complaint.  This place is soooooooo good, it is very difficult to get in without a significant, but worth it wait.  How in the world anybody could give it a 3 or 2 star rating is beyond me.  Best sausage and gravy I have ever had."}
{"text":"This was our last stop in Cleveland before we headed back to Dayton....We definitely saved the best for last!!!!"}
{"text":"Lucky's has my vote for the best brunch in Cleveland! I only have wonderful things to say about this Tremont gem.

Brunch is served on Saturday and Sunday from 9am to 2pm. But, it's not your run-of-the-mill brunch. Chef and owner Heather Haviland sources grains, eggs, milk, cheese, and produce locally. And, breads, pastries, waffles, and granola are all make from scratch. The combination of quality ingredients and creative pairings result in ten or so wonderful sounding (and tasting - the three I've tried, at least) brunch options.

I tried the Breakfast Burritos, Lemon Crepes, and Tuna Croissant. The burritos were fantastic. Two flour tortillas rolled with scrambled eggs with a \"guajillo pepper sauce.\" The crepes were good, but very sweet. I would have been unhappy if they were my full order - thankfully, my table split a few dishes. Lastly, the tuna was excellent. It's served on a homemade croissant (I think) and is made with carrots and red onions.

The service is genuinely friendly. The décor is consistent with the independent coffee shop vibe you'd expect -- featuring local artists, and such. It's very charming. And, also very clean.

If you haven't been, you must check out Lucky's! You'll be a regular in no time."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch one day since it was featured on the food channel at some point so we wanted to see what the hype was all about. Well, thats what it was, all hype.

If it weren't for the nice coffees we ordered here, this would've been a 1 star review because the food was inedible outside of the fruit. I read some reviews and everyone said to try the mac&cheese so I did. After I got it, it tasted liked the chef THREW the whole salt shaker into it. It was literally the saltiest thing that I have ever had at a restaurant. I forced down maybe 1/3 of it and that was it and no I did not take it home.

I might try it again at some point to let them redeem themselves, but they need to have better quality control at such a reputable place."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, service and atmosphere. I highly recommend it. Very busy for weekend brunch but not surprised...a gem."}
{"text":"I can see why they were featured on shows like Diners, Dine ins and Dives. The food is amazing! My compliments to the chefs who are amazing and do farm to table with fresh, local ingredients. The flavor combinations and profiles are on point. I don't live in Cleveland but every time I visit this is a must do! It's worth whatever wait time you have to get in. So good!!!"}
{"text":"Love Lucky's Cafe!  Today was my first visit and it was great!  I had the biscuits and gravy and my daughter had the Shipwreck. Both were delicious! The menu isn't large but there looks like there is something for everyone. The service was friendly and prompt. There are lots of delicious-looking goodies for sale in the display case but we were too full to even consider getting anything else. We'll leave room to try something sweet next time!"}
{"text":"Very nice cafe.  

I went back to try the $12 oatmeal - it was only so expensive because of the fancy eggs that went along with it.  The oatmeal was great, but I was not into how the eggs were cooked or the confusing service I got trying to fix the situation.  

I'm bumping them up to four stars, but my gut is telling me three stars is more what I experienced.  Regardless, I appreciate their mission and the delicious flava they bring."}
{"text":"We saw Lucky's on \"Diners, Dives, and Drives\" and had to try it. So we took a weekend trip to Cleveland and incorporated it in! Lucky's did not disappoint. We had trouble choosing what to order so we ordered a bunch of stuff. The baked mac n cheese is to die for. We also had to granola and the waffles, which were also very good. We even went back the next day just to get more of their yummy iced coffee and some treats for our ride home."}
{"text":"First, this would have definitely made the 5 star but lost one due to the wait, not the wait exactly, but had we not been there waiting for a table ( over 1/2 hour for two people ) we would have lost it to someone who just walked in.  I think the problem is more than one person was handling at the time.  You are told to leave your number when they take your name and if you want to walk around, they will call you when your table is ready; which is great.  The younger girl was taking the time to call people, the older lady was not and just moving down the line. Glad we waited.

Okay, I will add that the wait was worth it, so WAIT.  Went yesterday, Sunday (BEST WEEKEND BRUNCH).  I started with the special smoothie made with strawberry, raspberry , coconut, local yogurt, and honey topped with freshly whipped cream.  I could do that EVERY day.  My bf ordered the French press and a fresh squeezed OJ.  Both very good.

We also ordered Lucky's Brioche filled with housemade Ricotta sweet cheese and topped with summer mixed berry puree, honeyed whipped cream, and candied almonds as a shared meal along with the Biscuits and the Breakfast Burritos.  

The brioche was fantastic, everything worked well together and would definitely order it again, when available.

The Biscuits were FOODGASM excellent.  I could eat that every single day with that smoothie if I lived closer.  It was a happy marriage of their awesome biscuits and tasteful sausage gravy.   Dont miss that one if you get the chance.

Last, the burritos were OUT OF THIS WORLD, you can taste that its made there and everything, again, worked together nicely.

The potatoes that accompanied the dishes we had were like beautiful golden pillows of carb heaven.  I dreamt about them last night.

All in all, a GREAT find in Cleveland.  They use local providers which is great for the community and saw a garden area along with an outdoor fireplace to use while waiting to be called. Here not only is the food worth the wait but the service was excellent for such a busy restaurant, dont remember the mans name, sorry.  Efficiency at its finest, and those that may say its pricey, WORTH every dime.  You wont find us at the value menu drive thru and know that you get what you pay for.  Also, EXPECT to wait for your MADE TO ORDER meal.  

We will definitely be back since we take road trips often, Cleveland will have to be waypoint :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the California omelette and was pretty satisfied. It came with hash browns and toast and I honestly could say the toast was really good (I'm not a toast person) Maybe they drenched it with butter? Whatever it was, they were good, We also got their mimosas, too. I would come back here if I am staying at Stratosphere. I wouldn't say I would drive a cab to get here. It's just one of those quick decent restaurants to go when you're hungry."}
{"text":"Searched for breakfast places on our weekend away and this was a top contender.  It was chosen basically because it was the closest - I'm lucky we ended up here!

Cute little place in a nice quiet neighbourhood across from a little park.  We went on a Monday so it wasn't busy but you can tell it must be packed on weekends (and in the summer with their huge patio).  Service was OK, some of the staff were nicer than others.

We learned they try to do farm to table as much as possible which is great.  Lots of things are also made in house.  I had a scramble which was massive and excellent.  My friend had the mac n cheese which was, bluntly, incredible.  We also had huge mugs of tea, which I appreciated.  The only stumble in the meal was the famous biscuit we wanted to try - it was expensive ($4) and very dry.  I could've done without it.

Overall, a great place.  I would love to come back here.  Very unique and very yummy."}
{"text":"HOUSE MADE GRANOLA!!!! with the addition of bee pollen is one of my favorites.

Quaint, hidden gem in the outskirts of Cleveland that offers local/organic/unprocessed foods. During the summer you can eat in their garden right outside of the restaurant where they get most of their produce for the menu. 

A bit pricey but always worth it when we visit the area. 

Plan to wait a good 10-30 minutes or more."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out after my friend in California saw it on the Food Network and adamantly wanted me to go. 

I came here on a Sunday morning and was taken aback by the massive amount of people outside waiting to get a table. When we put our names down, the hostess told us that the wait was going to be 2 hours long O.O WOOOWWW! But I love the Tremont area, so my boyfriend and I just walked around and got a little snack right next door at Lilly's Handmade Chocolates :) 

When we finally got seated, it took awhile for the server to take our orders (side note: all of the servers looked a bit angry, probably from being so overworked). Some things we tried from the menu: 
- Shipwreck: this is seriously a brunch item made for a GIANT. The portion size was so generous!  It was quite delicious as well :) 
- Biscuit and gravy: Always a great brunch item :) I wish there were more meat in it though! 
- Thai iced tea: Not very impressed by this drink, but I guess I shouldn't have expected too much from an American brunch place? 

Overall, I liked Lucky's. Don't know if I'll be coming back any time soon though because of the terrifying wait time...Maybe I'll try a weekday?"}
{"text":"Had found this as a highly rated cafe in the Cleveland area. Needed a few hours to have some coffee, grab some breakfast, and hopefully get some work done before business meetings in the area. Had that, but with a few bumps along the way. 

First off, Papa Mocha on ice was a great pick me up that got me to work! Got right into the emails and everything. I was expecting to order the Shipwreck, but didn't realize they could not do substitutions. A lot of the foods have onions, which I'm allergic to, which limited my options. The idea of hash and potatoes were still in my head, so I ordered the strawberry waffles with a side of home fries. The waffles were delicious! But I wish the whipped cream wasn't right on top, since I felt the Waffle get softer and softer if I couldn't eat fast enough. The home fries I regret ordering as someone with an onion allergy. The waitress said the onions are \"strands which are easily removable\". But I found myself having to be super cautious with every bite, not allowing me to enjoy my meal. My stomach didn't sit well with me after, so must've ended up eating some of the strands of onions within the potatoes, despite trying to pick them all out and separate them. It didn't sit well for me. Finally after everything, I still had a few hours to go and wanted some tea. This is the first cafe I've been to that doesn't refill their tea or re-steep or even add hot water if finished. It was strange to hear that since usually I've heard of places at least adding hot water. Had mango tea, nothing out of the ordinary or expected though. 

Overall, I had expectations of this place and some misperceptions about substitutions and comparisons with other cafe experiences definitely affected my experience. I understand how it's so popular and how the farm to table would be typically appealing! Just wasn't for me as someone with an allergy to a food that's in almost every dish!"}
{"text":"Drop everything and go here now!

THE UP-SIDE:
This coffee shop is the most wonderful little place in Cleveland.  The food is fantastic (voted best in Cleveland for it's adjacent bakery) and the atmosphere is homey and perfect.  The staff is pleasant and they have free wireless.  Recently, they introduced brunch on Saturday and Sunday.  It is tasty and wonderful; bringing in a new and growing crowd weekly.  

THE DOWN-SIDE:
Because the place is so very wonderful it is getting a little crowded at brunch on the weekends.  (For good reason.)

THE SUM-IT-UP:
Please, please, please visit this wonderful neighborhood coffee shop; easily the best in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The sausage gravy/biscuits breakfast choice is amazing.  I have a difficult time trying anything else.  Yes, it is that good.

HOWEVER, the prices are high and service is slow(takes forever to get a cup of coffee to-go and there is always a wait - regardless if it's for a table or to-go).  And for that reason I give lucky's only 3 stars.  And for this reason, I get my to-go coffee at The Loop(am I allowed to say this?)  And for this reason, Tremonsters do not patron as much as they would like to patron Lucky's.

Clean.
Charming décor.
Great concept - locally grown is so important
Attracts a wide variety of people - so good people watching( like a tourist attraction)
Excellent food.  Average coffee.

No designated parking lot.  Streetside parking is easy as long as you find a spot.  There is a large Church lot behind Lilly's chocolate that is a good plan B for parking."}
{"text":"So I was yelping today for new places and realized I forgot to give these guys  5 stars!!!

I took my mom here for a mothers day brunch and was blown away! Perfect atmosphere for the day. I was surprised what a gem it was!  They had pecan crusted bacon.......mmmmmmmmmmm! And they gave my momma a daisy too!"}
{"text":"Another staple of mine when I'm back in Cleveland.  Love the brunch... especially the Shipwreck!  As others have mentioned, try the pecan crusted bacon.  I can't wait to get back here!"}
{"text":"So delicious and wonderful! The staff magnify the experience with their wonderful attitudes! 

Would love to have something like this in the north Dallas area. It would put every diner I've been to out of business! 

Keep up the amazing work! Will definitely be visiting again next trip to Cleveland."}
{"text":"If I ever move back to Cleveland, I'm moving into Lucky's.  And it's not just because the pastries are so flaky and rich-tasting.  It's not because the sandwiches are prepared the way they should be - hot, with fresh ingredients, and with enough to share or take home.  It's also not because each coffee drink is brewed with care, and not in a \"venti soy non-fat caramel triple latte\" kind of incomprehensible language a la a Corporate Competitor.  (Try their Peppermint Patty.) It's because of the simple comforts.  The kind counter staff people are probably sick by now of telling you how to get to \"The Christmas Story\" house, but who were kind enough to hand draw a map for me when I last visited.  I'd also like to live at Lucky's permanently for the cozy chairs and rustic decore that make me feel like I am sitting in a ski lodge in Maine rather than in an urban retreat in Tremont.  I hope Lucky's will have a long life in this charming, historic neighborhood on the comeback."}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy along with the waffle are hard to beat. Great atmosphere and staff! Must go if you are in the area."}
{"text":"If you're looking for brunch in Cleveland, I would probably recommend Lucky's! At least it was probably my favorite place to get brunch while I was in Cleveland. I knew that if I came here I would be leaving with a huge food coma!

Parking can be a little annoying, as Lucky's is on a one way street. It can get crowded as people wait for spots to open up. You may need to park further away. Or if you come at off hours or random weekdays, there will be less of a crowd than if you come during the weekend.

The menu is quite straightforward, and doesn't overwhelm you with too many choices. I tend to stick to the same few items though!
+The Shipwreck ($13.95): this is all your classic breakfast foods in one. It's delicious, and you'll definitely be stuffed after this!
+Baked Mac-N-Cheese ($14.95): the cheese is so flavorful, and you'll burn your mouth because you just want to stuff it down before it cools. Can get overly rich if you only eat this, which is what the applesauce and fruit is there for. This is my personal favorite.
+Waffles ($13.95): for those of you with a sweet tooth, definitely check these out. Super decadent and yummy."}
{"text":"Some of the best breakfast/brunch in town. Farm to table restaurant, fresh ingredients, great taste. Always busy on the weekends. Patio allows dogs. Has bakery and coffee shop"}
{"text":"This is a really neat spot to have your weekend brunch. Our server was bubbly and sweet. She helped our table order. I had the gingerbread waffles with apple compote. The cream was not too sweet, but went well with the other flavors. I found the mac and cheese to be really rich, so be warned. I didn't think the omelet was anything special. This whole place had a wonderful warm energy. I would definitely visit again if I ever find myself in Cleveland. But not before hitting the gym for a week straight before!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the food isn't that great for what it costs and the general seating set up/getting a table deal is a nightmare.  The last time we were there, my friends ordered full breakfasts and I was interested in a muffin or something light.  The waiter informed me he needed to check the selection, and we he returned with the choices, I decided on a blueberry muffin.  When my friend's food arrived, I waited a bit.  When I couldn't find our waiter, I asked another who said my muffin had been in the cooler/fridge and they were warming it up.  When I finally found our waiter, he informed me they were now out of muffins, apologized and walked away.  He really could have cared less I sat through an entire meal with my friends with no food and didn't bother to offer any other options.  I don't know if he was annoyed I didn't order more, but his aloofness about the whole thing and the fact I ended up with nothing was rather upsetting.  So many better places in Cleveland to go for a better brunch experience!"}
{"text":"Great, fresh food. That being said, it feels that all meals are very overpriced, and for that reason I probably won't visit often."}
{"text":"We visited this super duper cute little restaurant in Cleveland back in July.  It's tucked away and boasts a very flavorful and well-curated menu.  Staff was a little aloof, but it's a small price to pay for the adorable ambiance and great bakery selection after the meal!  Very yummy!"}
{"text":"Mac and cheese was some of the best I've ever had. The atmosphere in this place was adorable - I could have sat there all day and had coffee. Had a soft ginger cookie to go and it didn't disappoint! Lucky's cafe is a must if you are looking for high quality ingredients and outstanding service."}
{"text":"Lucky's is one of my go-to breakfast spots. With that being said, I've had the opportunity to try many different items on the menu.  Some are insanely good (shipwreck, waffles, pecan bacon), and there are others that are just OK (burrito and Mac n cheese). Whatever you get, you will not leave hungry! 
If you want to get coffee, the French press is awesome, but $7. After you exhaust your French press, regular coffee refills are on the house, though! The espresso drinks are well-made, but you might have to wait 10 minutes to get them."}
{"text":"Sunday we took the gamble of eating at Lucky's, and unfortunately we just didn't hit the jackpot.

The concept of eating at a farm-to-table restaurant is nothing new for me. In fact, when I go out to eat at most restaurants I expect fresh ingredients. Most people do. It's not hard for a restaurant that wants to put out good food, to use good product. When we sat down to the table we were greeted by a fairly hipsterish, mustachioed waiter who went into a lengthy (extremely rehearsed) speech about how \"At most places you can get a Reuben, and it will take 15 minutes. Well, our reuben takes three weeks. First we source the cow. Then we butcher it. Then it's cured in hand picked cloves and brining liquid. Then at its peak we let it harvest in a smoker.... yadda yadda yadda.\"

Looking over the limited menu, my friend had very limited options. He doesn't eat pork or dairy. We all ordered, and he ordered his omelet without cheese. There were no problems. The order was taken, and we resumed to have conversation and enjoy the atmosphere.

About 10 minutes later our waiter comes back to him and apologizes asking if he was \"serious about not wanting cheese, and if he could not eat cheese or if it was ok for him to have a little cheese?\" Dude, the man ordered an omelet without cheese. It's not that hard. So my friend responds \"Yeah, I can't have dairy. So I can't have the omelet made with butter or cheese, like I said to you earlier...\" So the waiter responds...

\"Yeah, it's really backed up back there. And we're just not doing special orders or substitutions right now. I can't have you substitute, sorry.\"

This, in my opinion, is ridiculous. An omission is not a substitution. If the food is fresh, and cooked to order... what is the big deal of skipping the step of grabbing the cheese and putting it in the omelet? I have eaten at much nicer, much more expensive restaurants that are always happy to respect diners dietary and allergy requests. 

I will never go back here, and I would strongly advise against it."}
{"text":"Farm to Table!!! Such an fresh unique taste. Coffee was hot and strong. And oh god the biscuits and gravy changed by life. Huge portions and good price for local organic food. I will be coming back amazing!!! $$$"}
{"text":"Lucky'a Cafe might as well be considered a cult classic in Cleveland. I am never disappointed in anything I've ever eaten from there. Two words: pecan crusted bacon. If you go here without trying it you are crazy!"}
{"text":"My boss and I had a breakfast meeting and we had all heard great things about Lucky's so we decided why not give it a try especially since our guest was not from Cleveland and we knew it was something local.  I loved the look and feeling as you walk in and being able to see all their homemade pastries.  I will say that I definitely don't foresee myself wanting to come on a weekend as I can only imagine how crowded it would be with only maybe 25 seats inside? 

The food was delicious though!  I got this hash like meal with a mixture of eggs, potatoes, veggies and cheese.  It was a huge serving and came with their homemade bread which was absolutely to die for.  I love hot things and prefer to eat my eggs with ketchup or hot sauce and they had given us their homemade hot sauce which I really enjoyed.  It wasn't necessary hot but gave my meal the extra flavor I wanted.  

Something I did not exactly enjoy was their limited menu? They only had 5 breakfast choices.  While everything on it sounded good, there were a few things I would not completely want to try and wish I had a few more choices.  I am wondering if on the weekends they have more choices? 

I would love to go back for lunch/dinner.  Their concept is amazing that everything is made in house or they get it from local farmers.  My meal was exceptional and everyone I was with enjoyed theirs too."}
{"text":"It used to be a 5 .. when they made the best Chicken Curry sandwich outside of NYC.    But alas, it has become a very average taste profile on some very good wheat bread.  I know she makes everything form scratch and grows veggies and herbs in the garden next door ... but last time in I wanted the Turkey sandwich not grilled ... AND THEY SAID NO.  Bye bye .. I know you are eccentric, but I am the customer and with no more allure for the Chicken Curry sandwich .. there are so many other good places to eat in Cleveland these days.  Nice knowing you."}
{"text":"Quality in the food has gone down over past years along with customer service. Last time I was here, hostess/waitress was seemed too busy for us. Then we got sat directly on-top of one of the main air conditioning vents...(you really have to experience this to know how annoying it is to be full blast AC in your crotch. We just left. Place seemed like they didn't need or want our business... HATE places like this."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I ate here for breakfast 3 out of 4 mornings, and once for lunch.  Our reasons for going back so often?

1.  PRICE:  Since we splurged for dinner every night, the cheap prices here were great.  As others mentioned, the 24-hour breakfast special was awesome: $5.99 for ham steak, 2 eggs, hashbrowns, and toast.  The lunch special available from 11am-6pm was a 1/2 sandwich with soup or salad for $6.99.  They also had $3 mimosas!! 

2.  FOOD:  Overall, the food was pretty good.  Not spectacular, but good for what you pay.  The hashbrowns were crispy on the outside and delicious...I also loved their sourdough toast.  My over-medium eggs came out overcooked on two separate days, however, they were quick and gracious to bring new perfectly cooked ones.

3.  SERVICE:  We had great service pretty much every time.  Waters on the table almost immediately, and the food came out promptly.  The manager was there every time we went and was very friendly.  He helped his servers with refilling drinks, busing tables, running food... basically whatever needed to be done.  The lady who ran the register at the front was very gracious about ringing up our separate checks every time...with a smile on her face!

4.  LOCATION:  I'm not going to lie... a huge factor for us eating here was that it was in the Stratosphere, where we were staying.  We did venture to IHOP one morning, only to realize it was more expensive, crowded, and not as good... a mistake we only made once.

I definitely recommend this place for anyone staying in the Stratosphere Hotel, mainly because of the convenience factor and the prices.  However, being just an 'okay' place, it's definitely not worth a special trip."}
{"text":"A double-whammy! Good-for-you food AND cupcakes?!

Yet another Guy Fieri spot that we had to check out while vacationing in Ohio. I'm a sucker for a place that has breakfast all day - so that's the column we ordered from. Our friendly waiter informed us of Lucky's home-grown ingredients method. My fiancé ordered the Biscuits - cheddar scallion biscuits topped with soft scrambled eggs and sausage gravy. I had a taste and was jealous that I didn't order it for myself! SO yummy! I did enjoy my Shipwreck - potatoes, eggs, seasonal veggies, bacon, and cheddar cheese, served with house-baked como toast & fresh fruit. Very healthy, very filling, very delicious.

For dessert on the go, I had a Vanilla Bean cupcake with Malted Chocolate Buttercream. The cake was too dense for my taste and was contrasted with a super buttery frosting. Overall I wasn't excited about it, but I still enjoyed it. 

There needs to be more restaurants like this! For the price you pay, you get fresh yummy food, at a place that feels so homey and welcoming :)"}
{"text":"Sorry that I can't rave about this place like others after being drawn there by earlier reviews.  If you want to save yourself a half hour, don't admit to it being your first visit.  You will be subjected to an impassioned speech about the cafe, its origins, its commitment to all good things on earth, as well as at three mentions that Guy Funnyhair from Food Network was there and here is what he ordered.  Frankly, I don't care if the sauerkraut for the reuben was brined for five days or seven days.
I ordered their fancy $14 Angus burger with bacon on ciabatta bread.  The meat appeared to have been fried on a griddle, not grilled, and the entire sandwich was overly salty.
My wife had the grilled cheese of the day which had pulled pork.  While the sandwich was OK, the pulled pork barely made an appearance. We shared a dessert that was pretty good.  Some chocolate thing that escapes my memory.
Their website still proudly declares that they serve \"pastery\".  Must have an arts and crafts room in the back.
We'll give it another shot if we're ever in the area as I believe every restaurant warrants at least two tries."}
{"text":"I love Lucky's but would be nice if they offered bloody Mary's or mimosas for brunch, especially on weekends. I have gone to Grumpy's on several occasions because they do allow the BYOB as Lucky's does not!"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE cafe in the Cleveland area. The coffee is great, fresh fruit and veggies. They make their own jam which is delicious! Definitely go here for a breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"The. Best. Breakfast. I. Ever. Ate. Maybe the best meal I ever ate. Don't let the prices scare you away, you won't regret it!  Great coffee, good vibes, professional service. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Love the small but crowded feel of this local gem. The food is unique and fantastic. Portions are generous and staff is super friendly"}
{"text":"usually 5 stars goes to the elegant restaurant serving fine wine in crystal, but not this time. i first discovered Lucky's in 2012 on my Eagles / Browns road trip. i was so impressed, i decided to stop in Cleveland on my way to Chicago so that my wife can enjoy too.

my first admiration was their green and sustainable business model. the fact that Lucky's serves all local (mostly from their own garden) ingredients is impressive; but hold on, they also make everything from scratch. EVERYTHING! i was blown away by the little things like their own home made condiments. who makes their own grape jelly?   who makes their own breads, pickles and ketchup? where i'm from we call that LOVE. Lucky's takes the time to do things right.

now for the actual meals: we arrived in Cleveland after a long drive from Philly. my corned beef was off the charts. not thinly sliced deli fare - no, this was a huge pile of thick slices of tender, juicy corned beef on Lucky's rye, served with sour kraut, pickle and home made potato chips. POW! so good. seriously, i've been to many Jewish delis in NY and Philly, and Lucky's would make them all bow in respect.

but i'm not done.

we spent the night and decided to go back for breakfast the next day. breakfast at Lucky's is like a religious experience. i had the biscuits and eggs smothered in white sausage gravy with a side of the pecan crusted bacon. [cue the choir of angels]

my biscuits were light, fluffy and better than grandma's. the sausage gravy was perfectly seasoned, not greasy, and by far and away the best i've ever tasted. 

ok, now the bacon... pecan crusted, thick, perfectly rendered and so good it was worth the extra night of hotel expense. 

if you go to Cleveland, make sure you make a point to dine at Lucky's Cafe. oh, and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame was nice too."}
{"text":"Okay, I know this review will come as a surprise considering the glowing recommendations this place has gotten in the past. But allow me to defend the rating first. I'll start by saying that I definitely need to return....on a weekday - for multiple reasons listed below. 

Their weekend menu is shortened and in addition, there's a tremendous wait involved. Now weekend brunches and long waits go together, nothing unusual, nothing I wasn't prepared to \"put my time in\" for. So we did. It is important to note that both the host and the waitress we had were incredibly overwhelmed. This was a bit surprising to me because you would think by now they'd be used to the busy lines (especially on a Sunday) and have a system down to handle it without being close to a personal meltdown. 

The place is farm-to-table and local - both huge attributes and worth being applauded for. But unfortunately, for me, the compliments ended there. We got the breakfast burrito, which was severely underwhelming and honestly, just bad. The sauce was overpowering, there are some key ingredients missing and even though it wasn't my first choice, I figured if it made it to the \"weekend short list\" - that it truly must be one of their better items. The crowd favorite seems to be the Shipwreck, but since they do not make changes \"on weekends because it is so busy\", and I wouldn't have been able to get it without bacon, I couldn't give it a try. Yet another reason to return on a weekday. Finally, the coffee (I got a cappuccino) was just ok. Now normally I wouldn't judge a breakfast place for their coffee (though some would argue it is a critical component), but when everything else was bad, I was hoping a cup of java would be able to save the experience. Finally, the waitress was simply terrible. Everything was a struggle starting from getting two glasses of water (yes, really) till the very end. The only time I saw her exhibit efficiency was when she went to grab the receipt as we were walking away from our table. 

But since it isn't fair to judge a local favorite based on one day of poor service (maybe it was just an off day?), one entree and a cappuccino, I know I'll be returning, albeit on a weekday, to see what the rest of my fellow Yelpers are talking about. Once I'm ready to drink the kool-aid, I'll go ahead and update my review."}
{"text":"One of the gems of Cleveland Foodie Places to go! In Tremont, open for breakfast and lunch, with plenty of coffee choices and pastries! Not to mention the amazing menu! Try it!"}
{"text":"This is a yuppy haven. $15 for biscuits and gravy... Very good but I have had better for $7. $4.50 for 3 pieces of bacon with pecan on it; tastes like sugar coated bacon... yuck. Signs on the tables that say please leave when finished to make way for the next customer. No way I will ever go back. Not cozy. Not worth the $$$$."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat in Cleveland. All fresh and unique dishes. Great atmosphere and service. The Shipwreck is awesome, try the cinnamon waffles and pecan crusted bacon. Also excellent coffee"}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon for Brunch with some friends. The wait was only a half hour, and they were eager to get us to our table so we could relax before our meal. 

The servers were lovely, and I was feeling a bit ill, so I had some communication issues, but they were patient and allowed me the time I needed to chug a glass of water before I croaked out my order.

I had the smoothie of the day to start. It was overall very good, but a touch too sweet; it was made with yogurt, berries, and honey, and I don't think the honey was actually strictly necessary. I think I would also get it without whipped cream next time.

My meal was the Canoe wreck, essentially a breakfast scramble with tofu instead of eggs. It was overall very good, but I felt slightly underseasoned. I probably could have remedied this with some salt and pepper, but unfortunately, there was none at my table and my voice was too croaky to ask for any, which is no one's fault but the virus. 

I hope to come back here again and try a sweet brunch dish as that tends to be my go-to."}
{"text":"I recently moved from Tremont to the San Francisco area and Lucky's is one of the places I miss the most.  The staff is personable and friendly and the food is amazing.  The ginger chewy's are to die for for.  

I miss you Heather and crew!"}
{"text":"Best Brunch in Cleveland. I recommend the Biscuits"}
{"text":"Delicious tasting food and definitely a hidden gem! The cheddar scallion biscuits were some of the best I have had along with the Mae pecan crusted bacon! A bit over priced however for what you get. Also he staff was extremely unfriendly which was very disappointing."}
{"text":"My new favourite breakfast place in Cleveland. All the ingredients are locally grown so you can feel good about that. I went here just before going back home for the summer and it was such a treat! Definitely coming back here!!

Just a warning it's pretty teeny in here so if you're going for weekend breakfast go early or be ready to wait!"}
{"text":"One lazy weekday I decided to roam Tremont with my mom to find somewhere neither of us has been for lunch. Made a random turn and we both had never been to Lucky's Cafe...tho we had been to their sister restaurant Vine and Bean and loved it so... and we were hoping Lucky's would hopefully be just as good!!!! 

We found parking pretty easy-enter-get to pick where we would like to eat-either in the front or towards the back...very cute and cozy. After much indecisiveness we decide on the Warm Spinach Salad (for the healthy factor...) and the Grilled Sandwich of Turkey and the Creamy Potato soup which was their soup d'jour. 

Everything was delicious-we shared each others to just get a taste and then asked our enchanting waiter what else is popular...so we can have an idea of what to try next! He mentioned the Reuben and the Backed Mac-n-Cheese (shocker) were extremely popular! 

As we sat talking, we noticed school kids coming by after school for pastries and then talked with our server about his background which included a Medevil History major in college. If I lived closer I would be back more often! 

I digress...if you are looking for a lazy afternoon lunch or weekend brunch, I highly recommend Lucky's Cafe for the amazing food choices and also the cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"The biscuit & gravy was excellent. My girlfriend had the granola & fruit which was fresh and very good. The tables are small and service a little slow but considering the amount of customers, servers did a great job. We are not locals but differently will return."}
{"text":"They suck at substitions! They will not take the bacon out of the shipwreck and they will not take the mushrooms out of the omlette."}
{"text":"Best brunch spot in Cleveland in my opinion. Today is the first really cold day of the fall... I got the biscuits and warm apple cider and I feel like I have ascended into heaven like a scientologist. I also appreciate the way they handle the bill. It's really efficient and quite frankly it turns me on."}
{"text":"My friend and I stopped here for brunch before a Sunday afternoon Indians game.  Finding the place isn't difficult, but the location did seem a bit random.   We expected a good wait on a Sunday but we were at a table inside in about ten minutes.  Service was friendly but did seem a bit rushed.  I went with the infamous Shipwreck and was not disappointed with their use of fresh local ingredients.  A tad on the pricey side but hey, I was on vacation so I didn't mind splurging.  

Did I go here because Lucky's was on a Food Network show?  Guilty.  Was it worth it?  Eh...yes and no."}
{"text":"This is basically everything you want from a breakfast place. With so many fresh ingredients and a well-executed menu, you're certain to find something to enjoy. Your only challenge is to find a parking spot!"}
{"text":"Weekends get busy so they don't do substitutions (I couldn't get an omlette without cheese?!). Someone at our table had ham in their tofu dish. Service not so great (no refills?). 

But - if you want generally tasty, locally sourced, almost all made in-house, and very trendy fare (see food network poster in window)- perhaps worth a visit. You can have my seat."}
{"text":"One of the best vegan tofu scrambles I've had. Ask for their homemade jam and hot sauce it's to die for."}
{"text":"Come here regularly, about 2-4 times per week, and not just because I work across the street!

The coffee here is absolutely delicious, some of the best beans/blends I've seen in Cleveland. Some of their blended drinks are awesome too--Mama Moca, Heather's Cocktail, just to name a few.

Only eaten here a couple times but the food has always been pretty good. Had some of the daily grilled cheeses and soups, all solid. Food is a little on the pricey side but pretty reasonable for a weekend brunch.

Staff is really friendly and helpful making choices."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast and brunch menu. They make everything in house and use locally sourced ingredients (within 100 mile radius). You can tell that their vegetarian menu was carefully planned instead of just an after thought like most restaurants. Our French press coffee was a little bitter, so definitely good with cream and sugar, but very smooth and rich. Wonderful meal over all"}
{"text":"This is a really cute place with totally spot-on service. It's a little on the pricey side, though. My French Press was $7, BUT it was a HUGE French press (easily 3 cups) of the most *perfect* coffee I've had in years. Being a bit of a coffee connoisseur I'll happily pay for another one of those. The waffles, however, were $14 and not my favorite. They had a vanilla pastry cream on top which was good, but it then had this rhubarb and strawberry compote that was way too sweet for me, and there wasn't any sort of saltiness or crunch element to break that up. I would definitely come here again for the French press alone, and maybe try something else off of the menu, probably on the more savory side."}
{"text":"Oh how many early Sunday afternoons have we spent standing in the cold waiting for our name to be called for the wonderful brunch! And it has lived up to our expectations each time! We've brought every single one of our out-of-town guests here and they have all loved it.

My personal favorite: the canoewreck! Protein+carb+fruits+flavor= perfect brunch! 
Coffee and desserts are awesome as well. 

One of our favorite Cleveland places."}
{"text":"Don't let the blonde hair fool you,  fool. 

Due to my work schedule,  my lunches are always after 1-2 pm.   Like I always say, it's the best time of day to gauge the food and service.   This was the case at Lucky's.

Because this was my first dining experience at Lucky's,  I was subjected to the farm/table speech, there's our garden over there,  we make this and that right here, etc.  Save it for the tree huggers.  I enjoy my plastic and Styrofoam. 

Although every last minute diner had follow up,  I did not.   A standard regular occurrence for single diners. 

I'm saving the best for last.   The redheaded waitress was engaged in a flirtatious conversation with a walk in customer.   As I was getting ready to leave,  I heard her talking about someone \"Just another dumb blonde from Westlake\".  I know she wasn't talking about me because she forgot about me long ago.  As I was leaving I said,  \"This dumb blonde from Westlake is leaving now.\"   At least I'm not a sloppy looking redhead.

Oh the food.   I had the Shipwreck.  Nothing special.   I make stuff like that at home all the time.  I think the only difference is that I buy my food from the local grocery store,  I don't know if any of it comes from farmers within a 100 mile radius.

I understand that people sit out there forever to eat Sunday brunch.   That's a head scratcher.  Same food stuff going on at a bunch of other places."}
{"text":"I ordered the reuben and it was the best reuben I have ever had! (And I'm from New York City so I've had my fair share of quality reubens from jewish delis) All of the ingredients are homemade (the corned beef is house brined) and the thousand island dressing was amazing. I ate at Lucky's in the middle of a road trip from NYC to Southern California and this was my favorite meal on the entire trip."}
{"text":"A great brunch place worth checking out in Cleveland.  I highly recommend their latte and the shipwreck especially if you are looking for a meaty breakfast dish.  I got the omelette which was well cooked but I was overwhelmed by the amount of spinach and mushrooms in it."}
{"text":"While I had to wait an hour for a table, the food was WELL worth the wait. I also stared longingly at the dessert display while waiting which made the time pass by a little fasters. 

The food was incredible delicious, flavorful and fresh. Everything at my table was spot on. The only thing that wasn't damn near perfect was my apple cider chai....tasted mostly just like cider rather than a chai."}
{"text":"The service can be a bit slow at times, but it's usually pretty packed and the food  doesn't disappoint. It's a great vibe, and when it's nice out the patio is a great place to have a meal. Great place for brunch when you don't want to get fancy or are too hungover to go to somewhere stuffy."}
{"text":"In my opinion Heather is the most under rated chef in all of the Mid West. Yes, I said it. All of the midwest not just Cleveland. Her cafe Lucky's is one of the best brunching spots to take my mother to. As a baker, I'm obsessed with her from scratch pastries and muffins she puts in the case at the front of the cafe. Yum. I tried this strawberry one with a crunch and it was divine. As for Lucky's menu, the shipwreck is delicious but I usually just stick with the breakfast burrito. It's one of the best I have ever had and never disappoints. Luckys uses the freshest of the area's ingredients ans even has a little garden in the backyard of the cafe. Adorb!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Brought 2 other friends and they loved what they had. It all tastes super fresh and packed with flavor! It's all local and handmade. Their fresh squeezed orange juice is to die for."}
{"text":"Always a treat. I had the shipwreck, my hubby the veggy omlet, my daughter had the gingerbread waffles and son had the rubin. All were delicious! Too much food but cannot wait to eat the leftovers later. Service super, attentive but not overbearing. We arrived around 12:45 and only had a 10 minute wait. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Small cute place with a great variety of menu. I found this place through yelp and this was a great decision I made for a small trip planned for Cleveland to see my friends.  They welcomed my group of about 15 people and served in a great manner.  Besides the wonderful customer service ,I absolutely enjoyed my biscuits and hot chocolate I ordered.  If you still have a little space left in your tummy go to a chocolate mousse bomb. Amazing !!"}
{"text":"Everything in this restaurant is homemade and they grow much of what they serve in their own garden.  I saw this on someone else's review and was compelled to check out this little restaurant for a Saturday brunch a few weeks ago.

The food was excellent and very, very fresh.  For as many farms as there are in the area, it really surprises me that more restaurants do not support their local farmers or support sustainable food practices.  This little place does both so they automatically get an additional star.

Because of sustainable food practices, however, they do not allow for substitutions.  I can get behind that no problem, but when I asked for a single poached egg in addition to my meal, they refused.  I intended to pay extra for the egg, it wasn't a \"substitution,\" but the server/kitchen wouldn't serve an egg a la carte.  I don't really understand the reasoning behind this, but since there was no explanation as to why it was such a burden to poach a single egg when they had the means to do so, they lose a star.

That said, the pecan bacon was divine!  I also ordered the waffles and they were also amazing.  I'll probably go back since there are so few restaurants that support local farmers and serve fresh food, but the server was kind of snooty to begin with, and after I attempted to order the egg, he was really inattentive.  This is a little café in Cleveland that serves food.  The food is quite good, but that doesn't give them a license to be snooty about it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch when driving back from Buffalo to Chicago. I immediately got the 777 reference from the address and the name of the cafe, cute.

The biscuits were all one could hope for and more; the gravy and the egg on top was quite delectable.

I could give a rat's ass if Guy Fieri ate here though. I tried the mac 'n' cheese and it was pretty damned good, considering it was just that; mac 'n' cheese.

The waiter was nice but it was a process. It took a good 4-5 minutes of lecture about the history of the business, the garden outside, as well as the specials and other standard server banter. Yes, it was appreciated but an abridged version would be more appreciated. We were starving and thirty seconds in just wanted to order and get on with it.

If I find myself in the Tremont area again I will plan on making another visit. Note to self: do not order the waffles unless the syrup is no longer an extra $4."}
{"text":"The pluses:Their baked Mac n Cheese is to die for best eaten right at the restaurant hot and steaming. They use local ingredients. Canoewreck is scrambled curried tofu along with the toast is vegan and really delicious. 
Minuses: poor service, wait staff can be rude at times. Prices are high, parking could be an issue. 
Coffee is fresh and the orange juice is refreshing. They are a breakfast and brunch place so if you want to have a Mac n cheese dinner come before 3pm to take out. They do provide nice verbal instruction on how to reheat it. Nothing will stop me from this guilty pleasure.... Alas the distance!"}
{"text":"While standing outside waiting, great big dude with guns on his shirt recommended that I try the oatmeal brulee.  I do not have firearms-related anything, but I hope you take my recommendation to get that just as seriously.

This place is really great- my go-to when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"When brunch is the question, Lucky's is the answer. Sooo many yummy options whether you are looking for caffeine, brooze or just good food! They have a huge variety of coffee and all the food is farm to table. I think our server said all of the farms are located within 100 miles of the place, which I LOVE.

I ate the best sausage and bacon I think I have ever tasted here. The bacon is very unique with a hint of maple. My entree (shipwreck) was good..but not great. Just a tad dry and I would prefer the hash browns be shredded potatoes as opposed to chopped up potato chunks, but that's just me. It was decent but next time- I will definitely try something else! The baked goods looked top notch."}
{"text":"got here early with my dad for Labor Day breakfast and man am I glad we got there when we did.  Seems like they were about the only place open that morning and everyone was coming here for breakfast!

Fast and friendly service, our waitress was really nice and explained everything that was on the menu. I must say after reading all the other reviews about \"no substitutions\", I am really glad that I'm not a vegan or vegetarian or have any food allergies like the lady at the table next to us....she literally got a coffee and that was it.  Couldn't eat anything on the menu at all because they wouldn't substitute for her.  I found it really strange that her breakfast partner ordered a big meal and ate it in front of her though....I would have left and went somewhere else so we could eat together, but that's just me.

Dad got the waffles....uh, $4 extra for a tiny pot of maple syrup, you've GOT to be kidding me.  Next time I go, if I feel like waffles I'm smuggling in my own maple syrup.

I got the oatmeal and shirred eggs, the fruit compote on the oatmeal was very nice.  Lots of food on the plate, I couldn't finish it all.

I must say that your prices are WAY too expensive for what you get though....this in itself will limit my trips to your cafe.

Oh and the hot chocolate was good, but when I order one, I expect to actually get a full mug of hot chocolate instead of the mug only half-filled and the rest covered with a pile of whipped cream to save money....when I'm paying this much for a drink, don't cheap out on me."}
{"text":"Lucky's food was amazing. I had the oatmeal and eggs. ! It was so awesome. I posted a picture below of it. The eggs were sizzling when they came out! The only problem was I had just ran a marathon and had to wait over an hour to eat. It is very small inside. They do have an outside so I will totally check it out in the summer and hopefully the wait will be shorter."}
{"text":"Just an overall ideal atmosphere inside or out on the patio. I got the breakfast burritos but tasted my friend's biscuits and would prefer them next time. The Shipwreck is also amazing. Be sure to get the French press coffee! I'll be back."}
{"text":"My 8 year old daughter saw this place on Triple D and wanted to go. We had an array of dishes from the bacon to the Mac and cheese. One dish we ordered was not for us, it was fine but just not us. Even though we said we would pay for it they took it off the bill. Again the dish was fine but just not what we were expecting. Thank you Lucky's for being a good and understanding place. 
Will definitely be back on my next trip to Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Three of us went here for brunch on a Saturday morning - waited half an hour for a three top. You can order coffee and pastries while you wait in line. It is kind of crowded while you wait. Also, the coffee comes in huge cups!

We ordered the Mac and cheese, breakfast burrito, and biscuit and gravy. We would recommend all of them. However I believe the Mac and cheese was the best. And it also comes with apple sauce to dip the Mac and cheese in to give a combination of sweet and savory!

Everything is local too which is a plus!

Would come here again!"}
{"text":"I've visited 3 times and tried something new on each visit... And I'm looking forward to going back to sample more of their limited, but very interesting menu.

Have to start with the Reuben - having grown up with NY deli corned beef, and some of the east coast's best renditions of the Reuben, I have to put Lucky's in a different category. Their Reuben has a different taste than the classic I'm used to, but different is fine in this instance. The mellow flavor of the house cured corned beef blends perfectly with their homemade Russian dressing and sauerkraut. It won't unseat Katz's corned beef, but it was delicious.

The Pecan Cruated Bacon had an exceptionally crispy texture and excellent flavor. The Mac & Cheese my friend ordered was decadent, the shipwreck my husband ordered disappeared before I could taste it (a good sign).  The breakfast burritos were outstanding - the complexity of the sauce kept me tasting and puzzling over the source of the richness with one bite and the heat with the next. 

The table next to us raved about their biscuits & gravy, so that's next on my list. We were too full to even think about taking away any of their pastries.

Not sure what the beef is with the letter codes or shared service style Lucky's uses. We've never had any lulls in service and while checking yourself out may take a little longer, you get to meet more of the other happy diners or coffee buyers ... Sharing a few extra 'good mornings' on your way out seems like a great way to end a wonderful meal at a place as welcoming as Lucky's.

Based on price, this will not be our 'every weekend' breakfast place (Grumpy's $4.99 Special wins that one), but we'll definitely be back and would recommend Lucky's."}
{"text":"Best Mac n' Cheese I've ever ... period.

I thought the food was amazing. Everything is local or home grown and it shows. Tastes are super fresh. The decor is quirky and quaint. I really enjoyed my virgin visit!

I opted for the biscuits topped with eggs and sausage gravy. I also split an order of mac n' cheese with my lunch matebiscuitsscuits were crispy and light and the gravy was oh so good. I've had a lot of sausage gravy in my time and I can say this was one of the more flavorful I've had. Lots of visible sausage chunks. The mac n' cheese...oh sweet jesus...the mac n' cheese. Without a doubt, the best I've ever tasted. So rich, so creamy, so freakin' good! It's the inclusion of brie that really makes this dish pop. YUM
Also noteworthy was the homemade applesauce, bread and coffee. Everything was really great. I picked up a chocolate and almond buttercreme cupcake for home. omggggggggg

Service was great. Our water was kept full and we really didn't wait long for anything. 

I'm definitely a fan and will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for brunch with a group of 6. Waited 1 hour. We were finally seated at a table that was made to seat 4.

$16 for eggs, seriously!? I lived in Chicago for the past 4 years and no restaurant would dare charge that for a freakin omelette!! You would be out of business.

Bill came out to $89 not including tip. We only ordered 4 entrees to share, 4 coffees and 2 juices. After I got over the initial horror, I passed over my credit card.

We asked for water 3 times. It finally came halfway into our meal.

Don't get what all the hype is. The food is good but I've had the same thing at Bongo Room in Chicago and Mae's in Detroit for half the price."}
{"text":"Decent food, decent service of an excellent (farm to table) concept. Bakery selection could be better - it sort of is lost in its own hype - not offensive but to be worth the hype bar has to get higher"}
{"text":"Had the Mac and cheese along with the Ruben. As our avid Ruben enthusiast said \"this is the best Ruben I have ever had and I have had a lot of Rubens\" great farm to table joint   . You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"My roommate looooves this place. I wish I could love it as much but there's just something missing. Firstly I'm vegetarian so I'm alway missing something, but this place seems to want to cater to vegetarians except it just misses the mark.
I had the shipwreck the first time I was there. It was just, bland.
I wish they had more tofu things.
It makes me very sad every time I see the menu with biscuits and gravy and remember they don't have a vegetarian gravy.
oh well.  i'll go back when they up their game on the menu."}
{"text":"Food is a 5.

Service is a 3.

Service setup is a 0.  If it weren't for the food and the people this setup would have this place as a total nightmare.

Here's a nickel's worth of free advice.  Ditch the goofball table numbering AND LETTERING combo system and adopt what the rest of the restaurant industry has and go with static table numbers (seriously, who uses table letters?).

I sat out on the patio this morning.  Fine enough, it's nice, pleasant weather and right by their garden.  Now watch the other servers come out of the kitchen carrying dishes.  Each one is skeptical whether they have the right table, because they're all looking for some goofy tiny little table number hand written in marker on a tiny flower pot.

Our drinks were placed on the wrong table and nearly consumed by other diners.  Then our food went six different directions before process of elimination ruled and we were delivered our plates.

Now the food is outstanding.  Sad thing is there's too many good things on the menu.  Oh, the menu, and the menu specials--the server had to read through them and it takes about 5 minutes of them standing there reading it off.  All of which could be printed on a specials card, or even a chalkboard.  No sense in having the server stand there reading off the specials awkwardly.

The kicker is in order to pay you have to go see the barista inside.  Well, by now it's late on a Sunday morning and the barista's station is packed.  The place is full, it's like a fire hazard.  Just have the servers do as every other restaurant in the world does and collect the money at the table for the convenience of your guests."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious. The service was friendly. Seating was tight, but comfortable which was perfect from a popular place trying to maximize their space. Atmosphere was right up our alley. It was a tad pricey, which again, is to be expected from a company attempting use locally sourced food and homemade dishes. You get what you pay for though. Definitely worth a little extra."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch spot in Tremont! amazing food and coffee, local ingredients, and great service!"}
{"text":"Great farm fresh options. Welcoming and attentive. Our lil guy was a fan of the vanilla bean waffles sooo... as long as he was happy we were happy peeps."}
{"text":"Best brunch that I've had in Cleveland. I came here on a Sunday morning and my table of 3 was seated right away. My husband ordered the gingerbread waffles and my cousin and I both ordered the shipwreck. The waffles were perfectly prepared and paired with deliciously cooked apples. One bite left me feeling warm and cozy. I was happy with the shipwreck scramble, which contained bacon, mushrooms, zucchini, cheese and potatoes. The como toast came buttered evenly. I found this dish to be comforting as well and we all left the restaurant full and happy. The customer service was wonderful. My husband ordered a cup of coffee and noticed that their flavored coffee of the day was highlander grogg, which is his personal favorite flavored coffee. Without hesitation, the waitress had no problem filling his cup with the flavored coffee at no extra charge. They also offer free wi-fi, which is also nice as well! This is a great restaurant in Tremont and I definitely recommend stopping by when you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!  Super cute, home-like restaurant. Ordered the gingerbread waffles and the shipwreck plate.  It was delicious.  They are a farm to table restaurant which I really like.  I highly recommend this place.  The coffee was great too!"}
{"text":"One of the rudest interactions I've had with a waitress, EVER. I have my 4 year old with me and asked the grilled cheese to be a certain way, and she scoffed at me and said no way. I'm at 25-30% tipper, I don't care how good your food is, if you can't appease customers, forget it."}
{"text":"This was the second time we had ate at Lucky's. Both times we were there we enjoyed the food. We have tried the biscuits and gravy, the waffles, and the Mac and cheese. All of it was very delicious. You need to arrive early on the weekends because it is a small place and it gets packed very quickly. I gave it 3 stars because of the service. We arrived at 8:45 and wait service doesn't begin till 9am. They came over at 9 and took our order and 3 times I had to ask for my cup of coffee. We also waited over 10 minutes for our waitress to take our credit card. They weren't busy either time, so not sure what the issue was. The food was great so I would definitely go back, could have been just an off day for the waitress. Very cool atmosphere with a farm to table message. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great food! Had the biscuits and baked Mac & Cheese. Biscuits were delicious, but the Mac & Cheese was even better - I think the best I've had. Service was efficient and friendly. The only negative is that it's a bit pricey. Most (good) dishes are over $10 a plate and the portions are modest. I guess it's just the premium you pay for great food. Will definitely be back, though."}
{"text":"Favorite spot in Cleveland! Everything on the menu is amazing, but if you only go once you have to have the biscuits and gravy. It's a little on the pricey side, but it is totally worth it."}
{"text":"i placed an order for 2 breakfast burritos to
pick up...when i arrive i did ask to add a side of sausage, so i figured it would be a wait.  no problem...but the 2-3 mins turned into almost 15 mins...the service was borderline rude and definitely inattentive to myself and other patrons as well.

when i finally get to the food, only one order was included in the bag.  i won't even go back to have another burrito added as its too much of a hassle and the food was rather bland.  too much of the sauce completely ruined the order and the potatoes were just tossed in the box.

i understand it's a weekend day, but they should really focus on greeting folks at the door and/or when are at the counter.  as for the food?  i can't say that id want to visit back to try something else because what i had was dreadful."}
{"text":"Decent healthy dining with interesting flavors and fresh ingredients. Service is slow. The wait is long. The prices seemed high.

I first saw this place on Food Network's, Best I Ever Ate. Michael Symon was raving about the sausage gravy. We arrived at 1 p.m. on a Saturday and still had to wait about 25 minutes. Once seated it took our waiter another 10 minutes to come to our table. 

The brunch menu is concise. It is full of fresh veggies, vegan options, egg dishes and the cheddar biscuits I was anxious to try. My friend ordered the waffle with homemade caramel sauce and baked apples. My dad ordered the shipwreck - an egg scramble with all fresh veggies and como bread.

The sausage gravy lived up to the hype. It is creamy, light and delicious. However, the biscuit was heavy and almost burnt. The waiter said it was supposed to be that way - cripsy. It really detracted from the texture of the gravy and soft scrambled eggs on top. I wanted it to be a perfect bit of the soft flaky biscuit, creamy gravy and perfectly cooked eggs. It wasn't. I ended up ditching the biscuit and just eating the gravy and egg.

My friend's gingerbread waffle was out of this world deliciously sweet. The shipwreck was fine, nothing spectacular. 

This was a decent culinary experience. I liked that they used local, fresh ingredients many from their own garden. The bakery portion of the restaurant had yummy looking scones, muffins, tartes, etc but they were really expensive. Almost $4 for a brownie.

I'll be back, just don't know when."}
{"text":"I just got one of their homemade smores for take-out. My sister is obsessed with them and she was in town for the night. At $6 each they're really pricey but I think they make their own graham crackers and marshmallows so that's cool. She thinks they're the best food in Cleveland. I think they're OK. To each their own!"}
{"text":"They have my favorite sausage gravy and biscuits.  Sunday mornings are crazy busy but they are always worth the wait."}
{"text":"This was an affordable and generally good slice of YUM in a sea of high priced restaurants dotting the Las Vegas strip.  We were staying at the Stratosphere and had a very enjoyable breakfast buffet experience here.  

Their breakfast buffet was on from 7am to Noon and highly affordable (with a beverage added after tax it came to about $12).  My favorite part was the French toast sticks, but the scrambled eggs were near perfection as well.  There was a vast array of melons and other fruits and lots of different kinds of donuts.  

The only things that I didn't like about the spread: the bananas all looked a day or so past their optimal prime and the first time we went, the Cream of Wheat was watery and generally kinda gross.  The second time though it was nice and thick, but you could still tell it had been made with water and not milk (which is how I make it at home and prefer it).

Overall I give the place 4 stars because the staff was incredibly friendly, it was well priced in comparison to everything else in Las Vegas, and it filled us up and lasted until dinner time without needing to stop our sightseeing for a lunch break."}
{"text":"This review is only representative of the Lucky's breakfast/brunch experience. Lunch reviews are over there.

If the question is where to get breakfast or weekend brunch in Cleveland, Lucky's should always be among the answers. It's the definitive local eatery in the Tremont neighborhood. They source all of their ingredients from within a radius of 100 miles, everything is made in house, and I mean everything. When weather permits, their on-site garden is a bounty of fresh vegetables and herbs all of which make their way into the food. Aside from the fact that they don't raise their own pigs or make their own cheese, all of the food is carefully crafted with artisanal detail and a heaping helping of love. But before I get any further, I've got to get a few things out of the way.

1. More of a heads-up than anything else. The kitchen doesn't open until 9am, but the place is open at 8am for the coffee and pastry crowd.

2. They're a small, neighborhood joint and during peak times (the weekend after 9am) the place gets jam-packed, This can mean that waits can be quite lengthy. I'm talking almost an hour. Just get your mind right and accept it or get there early if you want to try and avoid the rush.

3. With places like Lucky's, you get what you pay for. Don't come here expecting a $0.99 breakfast sandwich or $3.99 combo plate. If you want those things, I don't have to tell you where to go. As to the complaint that more than a few Yelpers have mentioned about prices, I've been thinking about this a great deal lately. Our expectations as Americans have been warped by mega-corporations and fast food chains. Frankly, I don't want to purchase anything that's 10 for a dollar, especially when it comes to something I put in my body. Real food isn't cheap. Processed, chemically-modified, frankenfood filled with preservatives and artificial ingredients is. I'm thankful that places like Lucky's exist and judging by their popularity, so are alot of other people.

4. Rude service? Really? I have no idea what these reviewers are talking about. I mean, honestly, we've had nothing but friendly, attentive service every time we've been here. So they won't modify their menu items for you. Get over it.

Back to the review at hand. 

We've been here several times for breakfast/brunch over the last few years and each time we've left happily satisfied, bellies bulging against belts and eagerly anticipating our next visit. If you haven't been here, I've got a bit of advice. Start with either of these two dishes - The Shipwreck or the Biscuits and gravy (simply called \"Buscuits\" on the menu). They are, IMHO, the two dishes that best represent Lucky's Cafe. If you're a coffee fan, their French press is a delight. It's immensely flavorful, dark and robust. Pastries, cakes and other sweet treats your deal? Check out the display case at the front of the store, you will want to try one of everything. 

Another tasty treat for which Lucky's has garnered some critical acclaim is their pecan bacon. Sweet, salty meat candy that even a pig couldn't resist. Just get a plate, trust me.

So, yeah, I dig Lucky's. You probably figured that out by now with the 5-star review and all. My usual breakfast consists of coffee and coffee, but if I ate breakfast more often it would be here. I'd also have to buy bigger pants. Lucky's reminds me of the little breakfast places we used to frequent when we spent a few years living in Baltimore (Paper Moon, Spoon, Blue Moon, to name a few). It's comfortable, loaded with charm and the chefs clearly care about the food they're making. They care so hard you can taste it. Really. You'll be covered in caring       when you leave this place. The food here will help you remember why simple things can make life so much better."}
{"text":"I would move to Cleveland to eat here all the time. We had the shipwreck and the omelette special and they were both really tasty. We sat outside and had great service. Also had two things from the bakery and they were both yummy. I highly recommend visiting!"}
{"text":"Let's get one thing out of the way... If you love only restaurants with parking lots, hate potholes and narrow streets, you're claustrophobic, hate long waits, then this joint isn't for you. Ok, we cool?

The quality of the food though, is awesome. Farm to table fresh and served very hot. Crowd favorites: biscuits with gravy, the shipwreck, waffles, and, who am I kidding?! everything on the menu is great. I'll make special mention of the Lucky's Latte -- it gave me wings... Not real wings, just speaking figuratively."}
{"text":"I have since my last review been back many many times and the hair issue is resolved!! Back to 5 stars lucksters!!





I love you Luckys and I am a regular (like a once a week biscuts girl).  Last week I found a hair in my food.  Today I found one again.  I know this happens sometimes at resteraunts but twice in one week is not acceptable.  Especially when I am paying $20 for breakfast for one.  I am unsure if you recently hired a very hairy cook, or what is going on.  I hope you guys get it together.


Also attention Yelpers:  This place is BYOB."}
{"text":"Easily one of the most laid back brunch spots I've ever gone to. I literally have nothing negative to say about this place. The place looked busy so I was ready for what I thought would be a 30min - 1 hr. wait for a table, but we actually only waited 10 min. Our waiter (Geoffrey) was sooo kind, such a pleasure having him wait on us. The atmosphere here is really relaxed and inviting. The outdoor seating was nice, just be prepared to be disrupted by bees or wasps if you do decide to sit outside. Luckily they weren't too annoying and we were still able to enjoy our meal.

The food here is amazing - huge portions at reasonable prices. I ordered the Shipwreck and Cream of Cauliflower Soup. Let me just say that both of these dishes will automatically put you in a food coma (or actually any dish on their menu). The Shipwreck is basically a scrambled up omelette with sides of toast and fruit - definitely enjoyed this dish! The Cream of Cauliflower Soup was also enjoyable, consistency was perfect.

If I'm ever in town again, this will be my go-to brunch place. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very glad we made this a stop! Had the famous sausage and gravy biscuits and wasn't disappointed. If you aren't starving or can't afford to bring left overs home, it's shareable. 

The egg was cooked to perfection, the gravy was rich and creamy... And under it all that biscuit didn't get soggy! I was only able to eat 1/3 of the dish but I really enjoyed what I had. 

The fiancé had the shipwreck which was also very good. 

Service was great, waitstaff very friendly. The room is on the small size but I think it's all part of the charm."}
{"text":"When we were there, a Sunday morning for brunch, Lucky's was packed with every table occupied. Thankfully I had made a prior reservation for my party of 5. We got to our table quite promptly.  What really stuck out to me, their wait staff were always cool, attentive and always available when needed with a smile.  This despite a fully packed house. This I think is one of the most complex formula to get right for a restaurant. Our server explained to us their specials, some of their popular dishes, and how much of their ingredients are home made. He also took time to answer some questions and write down our special requests. Many kudos to Lucky's management and wait staff for getting this right. Such quality service further enhances the experience of dining at an excellent eatery.

Lucky's Cafe has excellent food. Their home made corned beef ( marinated over a week) ends up in the delish Reuben paired with sauerkraut & potato salad. Mouth watering taste. The shipwreck is a perfect blend of scrambled eggs mixed in with hashed browns & buttered toast. The biscuit gravy contains eggs, hash browns, gravy & grapes. Check out the business pictures on yelp for some of their most popular dishes  All the great reviews on yelp are very true to reality. Once you visit Lucky's you are hooked. Their menu caters very well to the meat & potato lovers as well as the lovers of light affair brunch. Heather, owner was featured on Diners & Dives show on food network (check out the video on Lucky's website).  The popularity has not given Lucky's a superiority complex. They continue to provide excellent taste and a very caring atmosphere for their patrons."}
{"text":"My mom and I came here while we were driving through Cleveland on a road trip.   If you can, come on a weekday morning, because it is so peaceful and relaxing!  You can walk through the cute, little garden Lucky's Cafe has in the back and sit outside at one of their picnic tables.  However, if you're there when there is not a big crowd, definitely sit inside because their decor is just so darn cute and there is lots of natural lighting - the place feels cozy and happy and gets you in the mood for the delicious brunch you are about to eat!  

I ordered one of the Daily Specials - three large Cornmeal pancakes with berry compote, homemade whipped cream, and pecan crusted bacon crumbles on top.  I felt like I was in some sort of magical place where every bite tastes better and better.  The cornmeal pancakes were soft, fluffy, yet solid.   The berry compote was sweet, but not too sweet.  The whipped cream added the perfect amount of substance and dairy flavor to the berry compote.   I am a vegetarian, so I took the bacon crumbles off and gave them to my mom, but I can imagine that they would add a nice, savory, flavor to the meal.  

Now, the Shipwreck - unfortunately, it looks better than it tastes.  The toast that comes with the Shipwreck is delicious (and made in-house!), but unintentionally is the highlight of the dish.  The mixture of eggs, hashbrowns, veggies, bacon, and cheese is HUGE, but not very flavorful.   

When you're paying for your meal at the cashier, you will notice that they sell cookies.   They look quite average, but trust me, you will want to buy a cookie.   I bought a few and gave them to my friends, and they could not stop talking about them!   So, if you need to bribe your friends or anyone really, just give them a Lucky's Cafe cookie ;-)"}
{"text":"Really impressed with this little cafe. They have a huge garden outside with outdoor seating and really take \"Farm to table\" to heart with what they do. We had two people for breakfast at 11 am on a Saturday and were seated immediately. We enjoyed the omelette with zucchini, mushrooms, and white cheddar and the biscuits and gravy. Note that the hashbrowns are actually crispy potatoes, delicious but not what we expected. They also have an extensive coffee menu and pastry case perfect for a quick breakfast or treat."}
{"text":"I was very pleased overall. They had a great 24-hour menu that had dinner entrees like prime rib and breakfast. The prices were quite reasonable since you're away from the center of the strip. (I once paid like $20 for spaghetti and meatballs at Caesar's cafe). Here things were like $8. Fast, efficient service, and great portions and fine quality. Very happy with it at 3 a.m."}
{"text":"Here are my thoughts about this place. The food is magnificent and I love how all the food is locally grown and organic. And to be honest with you i think it's worth every penny because when your using very high quality ingredients feel free to charge me. Other yelpers stop complaining about the price if you want a cheap brunch go to Ihop and let the real foodies enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Great little spot in the Tremont area of Cleveland for a bite. I love the pork chops. The desserts always look yummy."}
{"text":"Wait time to eat here is worth it for how amazing the food is. Everything is made from scratch and is delicious. Went here for the first time during the summer and had the best waffle I've ever had. Best breakfast spot in Cleveland."}
{"text":"The food here was AMAZING. I had the Reuben and my GF had the baked Mac and Cheese. The entire sandwich was homemade, the bread, corned beer, sauerkraut and the 1000 island dressing. It was heavenly with just the right amount of meat, that was tender and tasty. I had to sneak a couple bites of the Mac and Cheese too. It was very creamy, it had brie cheese in it. A first for me and it worked. The next time I make it, it's getting some of that. 
The staff was SUPER friendly. They had talked to us like we went there everyday. Very nice. 
It would get 5 stars, but the $13 price tag for the sandwich and $12 for Mac and Cheese is a little steep for me."}
{"text":"Yum! Lucky's Cafe is a great brunch/breakfast spot. We went on a weekend at around 9am and were seated right away. A wait started to form between 930-10am. Street parking was super easy. 

Food wise, I tried the shipwreck which was really good! All your breakfast favorites in one--eggs, potatoes, bacon, veggies, and buttery toast. Large portions too, and I am so excited to eat my leftovers! The biscuits and gravy seemed to be another popular option. I kind of wish the menu was a little bigger, but they do have one entree that was on the specials menu. Our coffee was refilled often and service was great--fast and friendly :) 

They have a bakery case in he front with a nice looking selection of desserts, scones, house made granola. It's not cheap though, so I didn't try anything. 

Overall, great place. Would definitely go again as long as we go early to avoid the wait!"}
{"text":"Lucky's Café was a Yelp find for baseball roadtrippers. We read of the infamous breakfast and were not let down whatsoever. We ordered the Shipwreck and the  locally grown potatoes were perfectly prepared with a forage of veggies. We also shared the pancakes with the honey foam whip cream. It was sweet, but not overwhelming. Savory breakfast lovers would like this. 

Our service was great and servers seemed to be proud of the place."}
{"text":"Delicious! This place is so cute. We went for brunch on a saturday, it was very busy but we only waited maybe 15-20 minutes. All of the staff was very friendly. We ordered a waffle breakfast, an egg breakfast, and two green drinks. The waffles were a little dry, but the whipped topping was deliciously rich and not too sweet. The eggs were great with veggies and potatoes, so good! The green drinks were also very good. Great experience, street parking available everywhere."}
{"text":"Just had brunch with family and friends there for the first time and it was delicious. I will definitely be back.  The staff was great even with the large number of people there.  Great job."}
{"text":"First timer, & at first it was a bit overwhelming, but the place grows on you quickly. Very quaint & cozy, a little bit hipster. This is a small intimate cafe so expect a wait during peak times, but it's worth it. The decor is cool, the service is awesome & the food is wonderful. Everything is made fresh & is all natural. The cafe works with all local farmers.

The Reuben was very good, bread perfectly toasted, the perfect amount of cheese & sauerkraut. The 1000 island dressing was on side which was perfect, but I still could've used a bit more, very tasty. The coffee was superb. My boyfriend had the biscuits & gravy & loved every bite.

If we would've had room, we would've tried a pastry, those things looked delectable, I stared at them waiting for our food to arrive. I definitely would give this place a try, be prepared to roam for parking, but realize, a good walk is best after eating all that awesome food."}
{"text":"Recommended by our waitress at Nemo. Small, but strong menu. My first time having biscuits and gravy. I'm always afraid it will be gluey and soggy, but I felt confident it would not be here and I was right. Somehow the incredible biscuits stayed perfect under all those eggs and that amazing, amazing sausage gravy. Pot of French press coffee was perfect. Another spot to remember for my next time through Cleveland.
Also, the most cheerful waitress possible."}
{"text":"Truly inspired menu. Five of us dined. Five of us loved our food, every last bite. The Shipwreck is of course yummy. The bruleed steel cut oatmeal with a dried fruit compote was warm, lightly sweet and oh so comforting. But the waffle with a strawberry/rhubarb compote, topped off with caramel sauce and honey infused whipped cream stold the show - we all pronounced it our favorite. Delicious house made breads. Exceptional service. I will be looking for opportunities to get back to Cleveland and go to Lucky's."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch spot in Cleveland. My coworker from Germany tried Lucky's a long time ago and after returning several years later, the ONLY thing he wanted to do in Cleveland was to eat at Lucky's. The food is that good!

The Biscuits (flaky biscuits smothered in creamy sausage gravy) and the Shipwreck (mix of eggs, cheese, veggies, bacon, and hash with toast), are my usual go-tos, but I've also tried their four-cheese Mac & Cheese and their seasonal special Zucchini Cakes with Ratatouille. Everything here tastes fantastic! And the dishes are always cooked with fresh, locally sourced ingredients.

There's usually a wait here on the weekends - if you come with a larger group, definitely come earlier or much later (before 3pm) to avoid the lines."}
{"text":"After walking to the very north end of the strip at around 4:00a, we decided that it was time for a late dinner/early breakfast.  The only place open inside was Lucky's Cafe, but surprisingly, the prices weren't too bad.  So even though I was about half asleep (as shown in my profile picture), I managed to devour the T-bone, eggs, and hash browns.  I must admit that when you're starving at 4:00a, just about anything tastes delicious, but the prices here weren't too bad either for a complete breakfast.  So...probably not worth the 2-mile walk (or cab ride) to the stratosphere just to dine here.  You're better off staying near the middle of the strip, where you have better choices for food, even at 4:00a."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch at 11:30AM on a Monday, was seated immediately even with a large party (6 of us on our way to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame for the AP Music Awards). Server was friendly and quick to provide suggestions! Ended up ordering the biscuits and OH MY GOODNESS. I jokingly said to my family \"these biscuits made me believe in God again.\" THAT. GOOD. Vegetables and fruit are grown fresh in a garden right outside, and everything else comes from a 50 mile radius around Cleveland so you know it's all fresh! Going to have to make this a frequent stop whenever I'm in Cleveland because it's probably the best lunch I've ever had."}
{"text":"Another wonderful Lucky's experience.  I have been there 4 times, had 4 different things and 4 great breakfasts.

Lucky's is one of those places you can take visitors for a non-plastic and local dining experience.  Comfortable but a little edgy, organic and homegrown but not vegetarian...  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A perfect \"taste of Tremont.\"  Luckys never disappoints.  The mac & cheese is phenomenal, grilled cheese of the day is always really good as well. 3B special salad is a huge portion and surprisingly delicious since I'm not huge fan of beats. All the food is very fresh, and they grow a lot of the things they use in their own little garden or its sourced locally. Perfect spot for lunch a must try in Tremont!"}
{"text":"Look.  I'm not gonna waste your time.  Just bring your ass and pig out at this place.  It was probably one of the best restaurant breakfasts ever.  And I do mean EVER.  I ordered a la carte cause I'm picky.  I got a side of eggs (plus I added 1 egg for 3 total), a side of sage sausage and a side of pecan crusted bacon.  I'm a sausage super fan, and the sage sausage here is OUT OF THIS WORLD.  How-and-so-ever, the pecan bacon beat them by 1/10th of a point.  ONE TENTH!  Do you hear me?  Just do yourself a favor a splurge!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Lucky's on a recent trip to Cleveland after we saw it on 'Diner's Drive-ins and Dives'. Their claim to fame is that everything they make is homegrown or brought in from local organic growers. That may sound hokey and something that is just a fad right now, but I have to say that in this case, it makes a huge difference! The food tastes very fresh and flavorful. I had the Reuben and my wife had the biscuits and gravy. Both were well beyond my expectations and the best of each respective meal I have ever had. Some people have pointed out that the menu is very limited, but for me that didn't really matter. I found something that sounded good and was very impressed by what I got. 

The staff was also incredibly friendly and helpful.

I could see this becoming one of my favorite restaurants very quickly. I thought the prices were reasonable for how good the food was."}
{"text":"There are few restaurants that you would make a weekend trip just to visit and Lucky's is one of them!   Entirely farm to table, it's fresh and amazing.  It's in a quaint little neighborhood, and on a weekend you'll expect to wait 40-60 minutes.   Worth every minute.  We had sausage gravy and cheddar chive biscuits, and I never knew it to actually taste so amazing!!"}
{"text":"The food is top-notch. The service, attitude and wait don't make up for it. STOP YELLING. I live in Tremont but I've had it with this place."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in town I make it a point to grab breakfast at this place. Even when it gets busy, you don't wait too long unless you're in a large party (which I wouldn't recommend).

The food is fantastic and locally grown, and the wait staff is great. It's a little pricey for Cleveland but I'm used paying these prices for food.

Be sure to grab some bakery items while you're paying for your meal."}
{"text":"My husband and I just had brunch at lucky's to celebrate out 4 year wedding anniversary, and let me tell you, it was one of the best food decisions we've ever made!! 

We were able to walk in at 11am on a Friday, and sit right down. The place wasn't empty by any means, but there were still a few open tables. 

I ordered the vanilla bean waffles with a strawberry & rhubarb compote, topped with fresh whipped cream and caramel drizzle. It was absolutely, hands down, the best waffle dish I've ever had!! The compote was the perfect balance of sweet from the strawberries, and tart from the rhubarb. And the whipped cream & touch of caramel drizzle just made it that much more luxurious on the palate! 

My husband got the ever famous 'shipwreck'. Scrambled eggs covered in gooey cheese & fresh veggies, and hash browns. A side of house made toast & jam, and fresh fruit salad. 

We also ended up splitting a side of pecan crusted bacon (which in my opinion, is a requirement to try if you visit lucky's). It was so perfectly sweet and savory, with a perfect crispy texture! 

Lastly we split a pot of French press coffee, which was good, but I personally would have preferred the coffee be ground a little more coarse, that way we weren't drinking to many coffee grounds. 

Overall, it was an incredible experience, and I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Lucky's to anyone and everyone!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Delicious menu and wonderful service, love the garden and outdoor seating."}
{"text":"The dishes they have are great, but they need a few additional options.  I loved the gingerbread and the biscuits and gravy.  I really enjoyed the topping on the gingerbread, not too sweet but very tasty."}
{"text":"So we get there at 8:30 AM, and they tell us that food isn't served until 9, but really not until 10 that day because they're short-handed. I left and went to Grumpy's, that's my review."}
{"text":"I first reviewed Lucky's back in 2015. Genuinely, I tried to give this place a chance in 2015 and below lays my review from back then, well its 2017 and my previous review remains the same. Just because the food may be appetizing, its going to agitate me if the service is sub-par. I don't understand why a business that offers a menu would open and not begin serving food immediately, but only after a couple of hours being open. When I was younger and in the service industry from what I remember was if people aren't coming in to order food right away, then you limit the staff in the kitchen to a few for those couple of people that do come in. I came here with a friend a few months back because she was debating on which job she was going to take and Lucky's was one of them in the mix. I came in early one morning by myself keeping in mind the same memory of my experience in 2015. They pretty much gave me coffee, told me I couldn't order food, but here's a muffin. So I'm sitting in a room full of tables, drinking coffee and choking down a muffin when I have to be at work in less than an hour and am starving. I believe what this place needs in the morning between the hours of 7 and 9 is called a limited menu. Aj Roccos is open bright and early enough to study and eat, and they don't play Elvis all morning long. I'd suggest there."}
{"text":"Had this delivered and it was the most bland food I've ever had. I got shipwrecked and the breakfast burritos. I've always heard such great things about this place but was a huge letdown."}
{"text":"This is a little family, cozy place. We had such a great experience. We went with our 3 year old niece and she was a little fuzzy but Lauren was so nice and understanding. Lauren even went out of her way to give her a birthday cookie. On top of that the food was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Accommodating. This place knows no sense of the word. On roughly 3 attempts, customer service has been nonexistent. I understand the art of a dish, particular ingredients contribute to the various elements. I would NOT visit Lucky's Cafe if you have any kind of food allergies because they are not understand or accommodating (there is that word again). You cannot change a single thing. Your food is not worth the price, aggravation or pompous servers. Your pastries are overrated too. Me, my WALLET and my family WON'T be back."}
{"text":"I like this cafe a lot.  The food is good, the staff are friendly, and usually the wait is not that long, even on a busy Saturday morning.  I highly suggest the Mac and Cheese, as well as the Biscuits."}
{"text":"Lucky's is a great place to go if you want to pay an extremely high amount of money for somewhat decent brunch food with a side of crappy customer service.  Waiting for a table takes forever, and forget asking questions when you actually *do* get a seat.  I asked if maple syrup came on the side since I don't like my french toast soaked in syrup.  The waitress gave me an attitude and acted as if I had asked some crazy complicated question.  This is not a Cleveland gem and it's sad people waste so much money here."}
{"text":"I \"heart\" brunch, who doesn't? If you don't... well, I don't know you. Lucky's is a hit or miss brunch option for me in Tremont. 

Here's my take:
I absolutely love the concept of this place. Their eco-friendly, farm-to-table, local farmer lovin' idea is why I keep coming back. The outdoor picnic area is such a great vibe. Everyone ends up sitting together at the tables and it's really fun. You can see their garden in back where they make their own compost and harvest fresh produce. 

The inside cafe area is great too, and run like a proper one too. You can order at your table with a waiter and they'll give you a number. Or you can order at the counter and you're food will be brought to you. The interior is just really cute. I can't quite explain it. 

Although I've only ever been to Lucky's for brunch, the food is always fresh and so tasty. Homemade ingredients, vegan-friendly menu items, healthy and indulgent choices. Whatever mood your in, you can find something delish. Plus it takes the hardship out of finding a great place for brunch with variety for my herbivore friends. As much as they love oatmeal, they should have more choices than that. Lucky's offers them lots!

What I can't stand is the crabby wait service. First of all, as everyone else has mentioned there are no substitutions. Not only that, but the removal of any item from your dish is out of the question. That's ridiculous. If you have an allergy, how hard is it for someone to remove some toast from your plate? It seems that Lucky's would rather waste food than cater to their customers. Hmmm... not good. Beyond that, I always just feel like I'm rushed to get out of there. Like I'm just another diner, no one special. I don't need to be pampered, but jeez...at least make me feel welcomed. 

So, yes. I will stop back at Lucky's when I'm in Tremont and want some brunch. It's fantastic food and I can't deny that I crave some of their menu items. I wish I could say that the staff bothers me enough not to come back, but that is false. Oh well..."}
{"text":"This is another great spot in Tremont.  The wait for brunch is often long, but it's worth it.  I love their mac n cheese with the applesauce on the side.    It is a strange combo but so delicious. I've heard the coffee is great. I'm more of a fan of their sweet treats. I've never had a negative experience here and I enjoy bringing my friends who are visiting from out of town to Lucky's Cafe. They've always been happy with the food. And I think we saw a Browns player there once!"}
{"text":"Great farm to table restaurant.  Highly recommend making reservations/call ahead becuase there was a wait when we went there but our group was with 6 people.  Very nice staff and you can get coffee or a little pastry/cookie while you wait.  

Food -  I shared the mac and cheese and biscuits & gravy with a friend.  Both were very hearty and delicious.  I was full about half way through the meal.  

Service - Our waiter was very nice but not very attentive to our table.  I think it was because they were so busy.  

Atmosphere - Very relaxed and casual."}
{"text":"Me and a group of my friends have taken to sampling all of the brunch options in the greater Cleveland area (I'm a life long Clevelander so many options I am already familiar with).  Lucky's consistently gets rated as one of the best brunches in town so we had to try it out.  While the food was very solid, I was less than blown away.  Add that to no reservations, expensive food, and long waits for tables and its not a place I'm anxious to return."}
{"text":"This place is really a must-visit.  I went on a Friday morning, but I'm assuming the wait is really long on Saturday and Sunday.  Regardless, it's completely worth it!  The staff is incredibly nice-- mostly hipsters, but without the hipster attitude.  The menu is limited, but that hardly matters because the food is so great.  The shipwreck seems to be the most popular choice, but I opted to go for the biscuits and gravy and was not disappointed.  One of my favorite all-time dishes, I order it at any restaurant where it's available.  Much to my surprise, it was the best I've ever had.  All fresh ingredients-- amazing biscuits topped with a bed of fluffy scrambled eggs and smothered in really good sausage gravy.  Went back again for the grilled cheese and tomato soup, which was also fantastic.  Can't recommend Lucky's enough!"}
{"text":"Best Brunch in Cleveland. Hands down. Favorite thing is the Biscuits and Gravy, but everything is really good."}
{"text":"I live in St. Louis and I heard about Lucky's from Diners, Drive Inns and Dives and they did not disappoint. It was tough just trying to decide what to get because it all sounded great. I got the grilled turkey sandwich with cranberry mayo and had to get a side of their fabulous candied bacon. It was all so good I didn't want to stop eating but had to because their portions are so large, which is a good thing. Had to get a home made cookie to go with my leftovers that I was having for dinner.
I highly recommend this place, the food was excellent and the staff were all super friendly and helpful since that was my first time there."}
{"text":"The best breakfast gravy, I have EVER had. Even the water was tasty! The interior is nice,  quaint with fresh flowers at each table and immaculately clean. Menu is minimal, which means they focused on perfection for each dish with success. Server was a younger guy with a warm smile. I would recommend this place a thousand times. Way to go Lucky's Cafe"}
{"text":"I love this cafe! The Papa Mocha is one of my very favorites and I've been going back for it for years. (About 5 now, actually.) The mac and cheese is my favorite dish, and their pastries are great! I don't like that it gets very full, very fast, which makes the place noisy and a bit suffocating. But that just shows how great everything really is."}
{"text":"Not worth the money!   Cleveland must be in a serious shortage of lunch places if people are lining up to pay more than $10 for a sandwich.  

My wife and I just pulled into town, and we were both starving.  We jumped back into the car a ran to Lucky's.  We walked and were greeted by the lady behind the counter saying \"the kitchen is closed\".  I think it is kinda weird that they are open until 5, but the kitchen closes at 3.  Whatever, Lolita got our money that night.

I decided that we would try it again the next day.  Plus, I wanted to check out some of the shops that were closed the day before.  We got a table, and waited like 5 minutes to even get menus.  The waiter seemed out of his element, and really didn't know what to do first.  After we got our menus we saw the outrageous prices they are charging!  The prices are way out of line!  The Ruben is $14...........FOR A  RUBEN!  I ordered it anyway thinking that is must be huge if it costs that much.  NOPE just a regular sandwich that doesn't even come with fries.  My wife got the turkey sandwich.  I think that was 11.....still way out of line!

Sorry Lucky's lovers,  I can think of quite a few other places that I can get the same quality food for around $6 bucks per sandwich!  Not worth the Hippie Hype!"}
{"text":"We finally came here for brunch on a Sunday after hearing all the hype. We already knew that they didn't take reservations but you are allowed to call ahead on the same day so that's what we did. They gave us a waiting time of 20 minutes so we drove out there right away. All together, we probably waited about 30 minutes from when we called to put our names down which was quicker than I thought it would be. 
There is no parking lot but there are some street parking options. The restaurant itself is pretty small. The waiting area is essentially a little open foyer right in front of the entrance where everyone is crammed waiting for tables. Not the best set up since I think there is always a line for brunch. People were spilling outside and it was not warm out. You can grab a coffee or pastry from the take out counter while you are waiting though. 
We ended up ordering the shipwreck and the curried chicken salad sandwich. The shipwreck tasted really good (eggs mixed with bacon, potatoes, cheese...). I felt like there were too many potatoes. The curried chicken salad had a lot of flavor but didn't taste too curry-y which I liked. Both dishes were tasty and hit the brunch spot but were pretty standard in terms of creativity. I think I was expecting more than what I got because I built it up too much around the hype. I did appreciate that they used mostly local products and the service was really good, which I think made up for the food experience. 
Not sure if I'll come back again because I think there are a lot of nicer brunch places, but I would say it's not a bad place to try."}
{"text":"What a wonderful little spot! And I do mean little. Weekdays they have a very abbreviated menu after 9am. The brunch menu is what you want and that's during weekends. The creme brûlée oatmeal to the bacon, I cannot stop thinking about Lucky's when it comes to breakfast! The french press coffee is delicious and the service is consistently good and friendly and most of all--patient on such busy days. I just really wish they still had their east side location (The Vine & Bean)."}
{"text":"Hands down, Best food I had in Cleveland! The ginger bread waffles... indescribable you must try!!! And the latte? Perfect pairing. Funny enough it was my last day in town, so glad I left with such great experience!"}
{"text":"I went to Lucky's Cafe the first time yesterday and liked it a lot.  The Mac-n-cheese was good, along with my eggnog latte and lemon tarts.  The service was good.   The food is expensive, though, so you pay for having a fancy chef in a tiny place.  It was worth it though, and they have some interesting things on the menu I want to try next time."}
{"text":"Scanning through a couple of the reviews, it seems the two main gripes about Lucky's Cafe are the wait and the poor service not allowing substitutions.  Fortunately, we didn't ask for any substitutions and there was no wait for tables during our snowstorm trek over to Tremont.  Despite that, however, Lucky's merits three stars (albeit a solid three stars) at best: a decent, though far from exceptional, but charming, brunch spot.

The best part of the meal was served first (like an appetizer) in the form of the Pecan Bacon: three slices of bacon topped with crushed pecans and brown sugar.  The crispiness of the bacon was key, and while each slice was either not thick enough or maybe cooked too long to preserve a \"crispy on the outside, meaty on the inside\" dichotomy, the crispiness really brought together the fattiness of the bacon with the pecan and brown sugar topping.  On the downside, however, the bacon would have been preferable with less of the aforesaid topping, which it wears as nearly impenetrable armor.

While it's ever so tempting to call the Shipwreck a \"train wreck,\" it struck me as just about on par with your average breakfast scramble, though highlighted by the seasonal vegetables.  Unfortunately, the cheddar cheese topping is weighty taste-wise and does its best to ruin the dish.  I have to agree with other reviewers that it's disappointing not having the option to remove the cheese.  The Como toast is a little more dense and of slightly more quality than ordinary white bread, but it's rather dull and uninventive, even with the house-made jam available on the table.

Overall, I think Lucky's is a solid brunch place, and if you draw an extra psychological benefit from knowing that your ingredients were locally-sourced, then you'll enjoy the place that much more.  The intimate dining room (only half full on our visit) had its charm, though I can imagine that charm quickly dissipates when it gets crowded."}
{"text":"Ok, I am not sure why people put down the Stratosphere, yea...yea the casino action kind of sucks....but don't go there to gamble, go there for Lucky's and Fat Tuesday's....But let's get back to Lucky's....we were here with a couple that had never been to the Strat, so we decided to go before having dinner, my honey and I decided to play some penny slot to kill time, and LO and BEHOLD...I saw a sign advertising steak and crab legs for 9.99, well, most people (NOT ME) would be scared off by that, but hell it was a hard night, I lost some moola and was looking for some cheap (but good) grub....I am after all a foodie...haha, only if you count greasy spoons. Anyways, back to Lucky's the dinner was really good, the steak was juicy, the crab legs meaty, tender and were already cut in half for you....shoot people, what more do you want, what more do you need.....Oh, but wait there's a catch, you can only order that between 7p-10p or 6-10, I forgot, but I do know it ends at 10p. Try to catch it, if you are cheap like me. A damn good, dinner, though, damn!"}
{"text":"4/3/08 Prices went up again....  

***

Why have I not discovered this place before last week?  I've been here twice and am happy to say I've found a new place to finish my dissertation.

Good: 
* The food and coffee is excellent.  
* The pastries are made on-site by Sweet Mosaic Inc.  I haven't tried it yet, but was told that chocolate truffle anything is to die for.  Ginger chews, too.
* The vegetables on the sandwiches are from the garden out in the back; otherwise they're purchased from local farmers.
* Charming outdoor picnic table seating
* There's wireless here
* Eclectic, friendly crowd

Bad: 
* I could see street parking being a bit of a pain if it gets crowded
* It gets a little loud around lunchtime so I'd avoid it during that time if you're looking for a quiet spot to read.

I was told that the prices will probably go up soon; buying organic and local isn't cheap, but it does make everything taste better (and it's good for the local economy).  Right now the sandwiches are $7.50 ($6.75 if you get the special sandwich of the day).  They're sizeable, and come with a side of chips and a pickle.

*** Prices did indeed go up again - for now, they're serving lunch; the meals range from $8-10, and they plan on eventually offering evening options."}
{"text":"I had the biscuits and gravy - amazing. Picked at my sisters omelet - again amazing. Coffee also great. Yes, pricey but i don't mind paying a little bit extra for local ingredients and a small business. The interior was small but cute. i did feel a little bit rushed to eat quickly and vacate the table but overall would recommend it and ill be back."}
{"text":"Luckys Cafe is wonderful - but  ... it's not worth the wait that their growing popularity has caused.  If you REALLY want to try the food - call ahead, get the food to go, and sit in Lincoln Park.  That is a much, much, much better scenario!

Main thing is - this place needs to adapt to their growing popularity.  The food is delicious, but they don't handle their increased success well at all! To make matters worse, the servers/employees are frequently stressed out due to the large crowds of people, and the Lucky's Cafe I knew a few months ago ... is gone."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch spot in all of the land!

I had been searching for a delicious breakfast spot
in the area until a friend recommended Lucky's!

I came here several times and ordered the same thing: Tofu Scramble...it was THAT good people! My friends had tried some of their other brunch options and it was an A+ all around. I always end up with left overs which is also great since your money is going towards both good quality and quantity. 

They have the cutest patio with the cutest little garden of fresh vegetables you can take a glance at. The inside can get a bit snug, and a wait can be expected but I promise you, it is worth the wait!

Another bonus is that I never had issues finding parking. Always ample street parking and felt safe parking a couple of streets away."}
{"text":"The food was decent but the service and the owner are not. Definitely not a kid friendly place. My family ate there for brunch and we all agreed we will never return. Shame on you Luckys for treating your guests the way that you did and our group spent over 200 dollars there. Piss poor service and attitudes."}
{"text":"i came here when we were traveling, and writing this review now almost saddens me knowing i will probably never eat here again, since i'll probably never travel to cleveland again. we picked this place because it was one \"the best thing i ever had\" and \"diners, drive ins and dives\" on food network, and i love trying those places out. The concept of this place is also great. they cook with mostly locally grown ingredients, or from their garden in the back. its a house, turned restaurant.. and even at 9 AM there was about a 15 min wait. 

we ordered: biscuits and sausage gravy and gingerbread waffles. biscuits were soft and fluffy, and there was a scrambled eggs on top, and then it was smothered in the most amazing sausage gravy. the gravy was creamy, but so flavorful with CHUNKS of sausage in it! perfect combination all together with the eggs and the biscuits. the gingerbread waffles were amazing too! the texture was different than most waffles, so if you like the texture of waffles, then you may not fully appreciate this. it was definitely more one of the sweet  breakfasts - but it was GOOD. sweet cooked apples and syrup on the side. 

also ordered some of their bakery items. pistachio brownie and a scone. all very very good. it is a bit pricey, but i think its worth at least one visit if you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this place! Went on Labor Day with the fam and they were slammed. We didn't have to wait long for a table but I think the waiter forgot to put our food in as we waited 40 minutes, watching while others who arrived after us got theirs in 10-15 minutes. No big deal since we weren't in a hurry and were really enjoying the patio, we just never got an apology or anything from the waiter. However, like I said, they were slammed and not likely prepared for such a turnout.

When the food arrived I could not have been happier. It was outstanding. I got the biscuit that came with gravy, potatoes and grapes. Holy cow. I'm not kidding, this was the best sausage gravy I have ever had. It was so full of flavor, the biscuit and potatoes were cooked to perfection and the grapes were a nice, juicy touch. I cannot wait to come back. 

I'm a thirsty person and drink at least 4 glasses of water every time I go out. I really appreciate when the waiter brings a water carafe for the table, so extra points for this as well, haha."}
{"text":"Worth the wait and always a good experience!  I have yet to find a place that I loved like Luckys in Pgh for breakfast.... this was not your typical greasy spoon dirty breakfast, rather it was always a little nicer but cost effective.  

Food is abundant, there are a lot of options, service is always good."}
{"text":"Loved the baked Mac and cheese in Cleveland for the weekend and asked locals for places to eat and this is what the suggested and it was well worth good food great people!"}
{"text":"Cute spot in Tremont. Went here for coffee (their house coffee is very strong and delicious) and ended up getting soup as well. Tomato bisque and a side of pasta salad was my husband's order; I got mushroom with roasted fennel bisque which was so fabulous. Everything is farm to table here including a garden on site. Great spot for breakfast, brunch and lunch!"}
{"text":"Totally loved the layout of this place and the vibe, character, and personality it created for itself. (Check out Lucky's \"park\" across the street. ha ha ha). Super cute inside and out with the garden/outdoor seating option (weather permitting of course). The service was rather personable, efficient, and accommodating.  We came much later in the morning so we waited only like, 5 minutes, but there was still a nice crowd. I take that as a good sign?

From my recollection I think the coffee was pretty good. I remember loving our cups for some reason. Food was excellent. The menu provides just enough variety - not too overwhelming - and according to our server & depending on the season, Lucky's gets something like 75% of their produce from their backyard garden. I got the \"shipwreck\" - it was really yummie. My special fwend got the \"biscuits\" and those were pretty amazing.

I am very impressed by Lucky's.  I think everyone should adopt a little locavore in them and am always happy to try new farm-to-table establishments...go go go! I'm so glad I came here for brunch!"}
{"text":"Food is very fresh and nice. Just make sure you like the menu items exactly as prepared due to house rules regarding substitutions. That being there are none. 

Concept restaurant that hearkens back to the days before trucks, refrigeration, and FedEx. \"Farm to table\" food preparation in a highly effective execution."}
{"text":"So typically, and just because, we mostly do Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives joints while traveling. Most are hit or miss but this one was definitely a hit!!! We were told a 20-30 wait cause the place was packed! But we waited maybe 15 mins if that! Service was terrific. For how busy it was it seemed like we got our food in no time. I coaxed my husband & daughter into getting the biscuits & gravy and the Mac & cheese... Just so I could have a try... While I went with their corn cakes that was a special. It was fantastic! I think I definitely had the best meal at the table. To bad it was just a special. My daughter loved her Mac & cheese, and it was very good... Just maybe a tad salty. My husband liked his, but it wasn't the best. Overall we were very happy we came. Unfortunately we were just passing through and probably won't make it back. 

PS... The neighborhood is kinda sketchy... But definitely worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Street parking in a cute area.  Had to wait at least 30 minutes- well worth it.  Not cheap, but the quality ingredients warrant their prices.  Check them out on DDD's.

House salad was delicious. Delicate, too.  I had the mac & cheese and a side of crazy-good bacon!  

My daughter had a vegetarian egg skillet, which she thought was OK- she wanted my mac & cheese.  Boyfriend ordered french toast, I think, and it was out of this world!

Looking forward to going again."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Came here at noon on a Saturday an the place was just at capacity, we only had to wait 5-7 minutes. They have a bench in front of the coffee bar you can order from while you wait. Staff were incredibly friendly and checked on us intermittently through the meal. They provide a bottle of water with your glasses so refills weren't a problem.

Food: Started with a cappucino which was quite good with a nice rich medium-dark roast and stiff copious foam. The corned beef hash special was well-executed with their house-made corned beef being moist, not too salty, and having a light sear on the outside to give it some texture. It was mixed with fresh corn which was an unexpected twist but balanced so it didn't overwhelm the other flavors. I've had beefier more concentrated-flavored corned beef hashes but this was a very solid 4/5 for the dish. The bacon was interesting, the pecan layer had a mildly sweet nutty flavor almost like a plain cookie which complemented the salty savoriness of the bacon. I probably wouldn't get it again but i'm not a huge fan of sweet and savory. Finally, we finished sharing an apricot almond scone which had a great crumb and tiny chunks of apricot inside which were delicious.

Overall I really enjoyed my visit to Lucky's cafe. The food is quite delicious although it may not be the best i've had. I think given the solid service, good selection, and the attention they pay to their dishes, it is a great dining option. The only thing holding them back from a higher star rating is the admittedly high prices which for something like $12 for a bowl of granola and fruit nicely-arranged just seems excessive."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. The wait can be a bit ridiculous and a little overpriced for breakfast. 

Other than that, the homemade jelly is to die for and when the have hash as a special I wouldn't order anything else!"}
{"text":"Even though the menu was small, the food was really good, and the ingredients used are local. Nice place to get a cup of Joe and have a bite."}
{"text":"We'd decided on Lucky's for brunch, having read and heard about it as being \"dang good\" for such an occasion.  Our visit took place on a Sunday in the early afternoon, and as expected, Lucky's was slammed.  It's a smaller eatery tucked into the back streets of Tremont, surrounded by residential housing, a high-end chocolate & beer place, and some other hipster stores - while the emphasis upon locally-grown produce, etc. is apparent, as well as the seemingly genuine pride of place that Lucky's has for Cleveland, large and spacious is what it's not (although, in their defense, outdoor seating is available).  In short, don't expect to avoid waiting in a line to gain entry.  Our wait wasn't too bad (less than ten minutes), even with the work-day at Lucky's obviously in full swing.  We were seated, commenced our conversation, and waited for our server.

And waited for our server.
And waited for our server.
And looked through the menu, making our meal decisions, grinning about all of the delicious-sounding options (while lamenting their price tag).  
And waited for our server some more.
And noticed that a fair number of tables around us were waiting as well, one albeit definitely less patiently (judging by the strained expression on her face, they were pretty hungry and annoyed).

At long last, our server showed up, asked if we'd like to get something to drink, took our order on the whole, and disappeared.  She may have been tired, as it was the rush-brunch hour, but there wasn't a lot of engagement with us at all.

Then, the waiting for our meal commenced.  I began to count at the twenty-minute mark, watching the tables around us.  A couple was seated (after us) to our right, with another couple seated (after us, and after couple on the right) to our left.  The left-handers received their meal first, followed by the grumpy, hungry folks on the right (who asked to speak to the manager after their meal, and were given a phone number to call instead, with no apology), and finally, after we'd waited for 35-40 minutes for our meal, it arrived.

It was rich and delicious - don't get me wrong.  I'd ordered the backed Macaroni & Cheese with Bacon, and it was ridiculous.  Made from scratch with heavy cream, multiple cheeses, and the works, it was smokily offset by the same kind of bacon my wife received on the side of her meal.  I tend to finish my meals, and I honestly couldn't hack this one - tasty as all get out, but so, so freaking rich (not that I didn't expect it, reading the ingredients).  It was only comparable to the Mac & Cheese I had in Seattle at Lunch Box Laboratory (which is phenomenal) - really good stuff.  My wife's meal was also pretty dang tasty - huge waffles, topped with legit whipped cream and all kinds of locally-grown fruity goodness.  I felt cavities forming instantly when I took a bite, and she couldn't finish it, either.  All in all, a very tasty meal, albeit pretty intense - the bill was pretty intense, as well, coming in just over $40.00 (with tip).

In observing other tables, I found myself wondering afterward if our server just had an off day, or perhaps, if we'd gotten stuck with the \"chill\" girl who just doesn't really care.  The other servers seemed sprightly and involved, with the dude taking care of a table near explaining how awesome the place is, how you're not allowed to substitute stuff on the menu (I suppose because the place is so small, and has a limited run of meals), and the like.  Kind of wish we'd gotten him, instead.

Not a bad experience, but probably not a repeat.  Good food?  Check.  Expensive?  Oh, yes.  Service?  Depends on who you get.  Flexibility in regard to meal content?  Apparently, nada."}
{"text":"I have never had anything bad from Lucky's... 

This place has gotten me through a few movie productions, being across the street from the house I regularly stay in, when working in Cleveland. 

The Mama's White Mocha is always great...
ALWAYS.

The seasonal Potato Leek soup is the sh*t that killed Elvis (as in, it's ridiculously good AND filling).


Always locally source which is, of course,
Respectable.

Don't skip this place (always packed for brunch on weekends, just a heads up)"}
{"text":"Had read a few reviews before coming but wanted to check this out ourselves.  Cute little place with lots of outdoor seating too.  Glad we weren't in a rush because it took about 40 minutes to get our food but the wait was well worth it.  I was also pleasantly surprised to see specialty decaf coffee on the menu! I got the canoe wreck and hubby got the biscuits and gravy.  He was shocked at the prices which are high, but it's delicious and made from local ingredients."}
{"text":"It was fine.  Nothing fancy.  The buffet breakfast was nothing to be excited about, but then again I'm not a breakfast person and I am a waste of a buffet."}
{"text":"Why do people like this place? I went here several times just to be cool...I was unimpressed and still...not that cool ;)

Food: Tasteless
Atmosphere: cute but nothing to make me say \"I want to live here\", just an old house setting
Service: like an airline, polite but not really

Out of the places I've been, this is just not listed as one of my faves. I mean, it's ok...that's the reason I go there when one of my kooky friends want to. But several of us agree...meh.

*as a side note, they aren't super accommodating if you're gluten free."}
{"text":"We ordered a half waffle with no toppings knowing our toddler will not eat compotes but they still brought it out with the toppings covering the waffle. I knew it would not go over well and the server actually was trying to problem solve through this, maybe she is new or the restaurant frowns upon comping food, but I was shocked when the waitress suggested someone else at the table eat the half of the waffle that we ordered in advance for our toddler. We brought our guest from Dallas and I was quickly becoming mortified! The waitress eventually made it right but it was questionable. I wouldn't want her to get in trouble, but at the same time to pay for a waffle we didn't want is not right. Moving on, the rest of the meal was great but one of our cars got towed and there is no way we parked in front of a driveway and there were no signs saying we parked anywhere illegal, so it made the experience pretty awful. This has to be some sort of City of Cleveland scam- the people lined up outside the tow place looking miserable was ridiculous. Shelling out 200.00 bucks and a lot of wasted time to get our car back with an out of town guest and toddler was not fun. The food tasted amazing but we probably won't be going back to Tremont any time soon."}
{"text":"I read all of the reviews on this site during our 1.5 hour wait for brunch over the weekend, and thought they might have been a little harsh.. until we sat down, waited 30 minutes for a menu, and got lukewarm tap water in a plastic cup. 

Maybe it's just the hype that made us expect much more than we got. The biscuits and gravy plate was pretty good, but really nothing to write home about. The cheddar biscuits tasted just like regular biscuits, and the potatoes were so salty they made my jaws hurt. We got the famed baked mac and cheese, too, but also not great - just standard white sauce mac and cheese. The best thing we had were the scrambled eggs that came with the mini breakfast plate for our baby. 

I guess the food is alright, but just that. And definitely not worth the prices, or the hassle of parking and the crowd, and for sure not worth the wait. $9.50 for a tiny plate of scrambled eggs and a little pile of potato pieces with a wedge of pineapple is ridiculous. 

We won't be going back, for sure. We also wouldn't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm a fan! I was in town for a friends Bday and we need a good brunch place to get rid of the hangover blue and saw this place on yelp. There's a reason they have such a high rating and its because there on point with food! they have a garden in the back that grown most of their food in and make the majority of everything they server onsite. The egg Benedict were on point! But, I'd suggest staying away from the pecan crust bacon. All said in done I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food was local and full of flavor. Service was prompt,timely and courteous. Atmosphere was nice and plenty of people who seemed satisfied with there meals as well!"}
{"text":"Best corned beef sandwich I have had in my life. There's mac 'n cheese is mixed with so many different cheeses, I think Brie, Cheddar, I can't even remember, but so many awesome cheeses. And they're all local and organic and tons of vegan stuff. Tea was great!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I will definitely return next time I'm in Cleveland. We had the shipwreck, sausage gravy and buscuits, and waffles with apple compote and carmel leche creme. The ambiance is quaint and the service friendly. They even have an outdoor eating area where they grow their own herbs and vegetables. Super cute!"}
{"text":"Best biscuits and gravy... Exceptional really!!! Lucky's is such a small quaint little place with a wonderful fresh garden they use in their dishes. Been there a few times and will continue to go back. Sometimes theres a bit of a wait but I totally understand THE FOOD IS THAT GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"I'm sure this is a nice place to dine in, but order with Ubereats is a gamble. The food is generally on point, but they often mess my order up. It's usually in some minor way that doesn't deter me from continuing to order from them, but rather this is a cautionary tale. It can be incredibly frustrating when you get a delivery and find you have ordered something and it isn't made right, or just lazily tossed together like the spattering of potatoes as a \"side\" for my breakfast burritos. Disappointed, but still hungry. Like I said, the food isn't bad, but he execution is a little irritating"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a suggestion by my mom. Got the shipwreck and it was amazing! Good portion sizes, flavors were great and the service was quick. The Rest of my family loved their meals too."}
{"text":"This place had decent food, but anything with eggs (that wasn't scrambled) was undercooked (think snotty eggs). The service was good. Be aware that this place makes no substitutions and is not able to split checks."}
{"text":"Take a crack at the bruleed oatmeal. Fair warning, the side of eggs are unpredictably cooked each time (unpred-egg-table?) Things always sound a little better on paper, but overall a solid place to brunch"}
{"text":"I expect most eateries in Vegas to be open 24-hours, so imagine my disappointment and confusion when my friend and I were walking around at 11pm and running into one closed joint after another.

What???  Have things changed since I last visited Vegas?!  Or were we just lucky last time and managed to find only open places?

Anyway, Lucky's gets an initial star for simply being 24 hours.  That is a MUST in Vegas because, quite frankly, we discard all rules relating to eating, sleeping, pretty much anything when in that town.

We came here twice this past weekend, once around 11pm and another night at around 3am.  Here are some awesome points:

+ 24 hours FTW! 
+ Good prices for GIANT portions
+ Pretty good variety of food, from sandwiches, fried foods, breakfast items, your standard diner fare
+ Decently tasty!  I got a turkey avocado sandwich at one point, with some really tasty fries.  And tried my friend's chicken tenders which were also good, and came in a HUGE portion.  Some of my other friends got chicken and waffles, and they were raving about it, so I assume it was probably really good.

I'm overall just really impressed with the amount of food they give you for the price.  It's a pretty good deal.

That and the 24-hour thing is what seals the deal.  

The fact that it's in the Stratosphere might be a deterrent, but if you're staying here anyway (which we were), then it's a decent choice."}
{"text":"Oh Luckys Luckys Luckys... you were hyped up too much. For the price I paid and for the menu varieties, I almost want to give you a 2-star. 

This place is expensive and the menu was fairly small. I can see why it's such a popular spot: the waiters are friendly, the service is fast, and it's a good little spot in tremont with a really cozy atmosphere. 

Now to the food... it was good, but not THE BOMB. Off the top of my head, I already have 2 other breakfast places that you should try before Luckys: The Inn on Coventry and Algebra Tea House, located in Cleveland Heights and Little Italy respectively.

Here's what to order if you do decide to try out Lucky's: 

Como Toast (4) : most of the dishes has this como toast. It's a unique toast, harder than your normal oven toast and it was probably the best part of my meal of that day. 

Pecan Bacon (3.5) : Oh WOW! The pecan bacon is so good! It's a hard bacon with pecans all over the bacon. I must warn you, this thing is probably 500 calories per bacon and it is a bit sweet. But it's delicious and worth it! 

Here's what I wasn't huge on: 

Shipwreck (3): This is just your typical blend of all breakfast ingredients scrambled together. Algebra Tea House's Algebra Omelette is much more delicious. However, this dish is solid, just not over the top good. 

Mama Chocolate or Mom's Latte.. forgot what it's called (3): This was a lower calorie hot chocolate if i remember right. One, WAYYY too low cal, to the point where i felt like my hot chocolate was just 4/5th milk and 1/5 chocolate. needs a little more chocolate please."}
{"text":"While many restaurants claim to be \"farm fresh\" Lucky's actually grows produce in their back yard. No joke, these guys actually have a produce garden behind the building. We came here for brunch on a  Saturday and couldn't have been happier. The coffee was excellent and the Reuben was one of the best I've had, second only to Kaplansky's in Toronto. Almost everything on our plate was made in house (including the corn beef). Now I realize $17 for breakfast is a bit pricy, but trust me, when food is this fresh it's worth every penny. Farm to table? Yes please!"}
{"text":"This cafe has all the makings of a five star joint, except that our service went from good to meh.  Even with its popularity in the neighborhood and on the Food Network, we were able to get a table within 15 minutes of arriving.  They had a large pitcher of cucumber water available while we waited (nice touch!).  

Lucky's has its own organic garden, short but delicious menu, full pastry case, and an eclectic vibe that makes Tremont so great.  I really like this place!

The food was positively divine!  Straight from food heaven.

Between the five of us, we enjoyed their famous rueben sandwich (that clove!), biscuits and gravy, breakfast burrito, and oatmeal waffles with rhubarb compote, homemade cream and toasted pecans, with brown sugar bacon on the side (not worth the hype, sorry!).  The coffee was also robust, and every bite was worth the calories.  The only major issue we had was that one of our orders arrived after the rest of us had finished (and it was the second of two orders of biscuits).  We had to remind them to bring it out, and they barely mentioned it, even though it was their error - seemed strangely dismissive.  

Ah, well.. I suppose you can't be perfect every time.

Thankfully, our portions were big enough to share, so our friend got to enter in to our food bliss while he waited for his order to arrive.

Carrot torte, salted caramel brownie, and key lime tart for the road.  

It was a good day."}
{"text":"WHY didn't I try this sooner?! This place was amazing. I am ecstatic. The mac n cheese was deliciously rich -  Cheddar, brie, Parmesan and mozzarella cheeses, baked with pasta and cream topped with brioche bread crumbs served with house made apple sauce.  That waffle was yum-balls; there is some sort of cream/cheese in their honey whipped cream that is simply delightful.

And, I am so impressed with that desserts bar when you walk in. The chocolate mousse bomb was definitely a treat. That pastries case is refrigerated! Props."}
{"text":"*****OUT OT TOWNER REVIEW*****
Positives: the pecan crusted bacon was great as a side. The biscuits and gravy were good, not great. 
Negatives: over priced. $15 for biscuits and gravy is absurd. Hailing from Denver, where majority of restaurants promote \"farm to table\", I find it very difficult paying an extra $5+ for all the meals just because of this...
The gravy for the biscuits was very tasty and rich, however the biscuits were as hard as croutons in a salad. With not a very extensive list of breakfast items on their brunch menu you'd think they'd nail it.
********************
All in all it was a nice atmosphere, but would not recommend. It was a tough pill to swallow when I paid our tables bill of $82 not including the tip(4 for brunch no alcohol)"}
{"text":"The food here is really good, the Mac and cheese is to die for. I have never been overly impressed by the service but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"We came in to Cleveland to celebrate my mother-in-law's 70th birthday.  While there we wanted to meet up with some old friends for brunch.  After looking online my wife found Lucky's and thought we should meet-up there.

While my overall impression of the place was that it was trying too hard to be hip and trendy, while remaining cute and neighborhoody, the kitchen has the chops to back up most of their reputation.  There were 6 of us so there were a number of dishes ordered and passed around. I ordered the Biscuits and Gravy, something I am always leery about as I've had so many bad versions.  This one was good, not great but good.  The gravy was excellent, although I could have used more of it on the plate to moisten the dense. leaden biscuits.  They were tasty but tough and too dense.  Two of our group had the waffles which came with a host of toppings, including a peach and rhubarb compote.  It was tasty, very tasty.  The waffle itself had good flavor but was rather soggy, like it had been sitting for a long time.  It would have been nice to have a crispy waffle.  I am not a fan of breakfast burritos but that's what my wife ordered.  It was excellent, and the ranchero sauce that topped it was awesome.  Another person ordered the Shipwreck, which looked amazing, and she enjoyed it, but I didn't taste it so I can't comment on it.  They were running a Peach Crisp as a dessert special, which my mother-in-law ordered as her meal.  It was a large portion and tasted great.  I also ordered an order of the Pecan Bacon, which I had heard about, but have to admit that I was very underwhelmed with it, and at $4.50 for 3, not very thick slices I thought it was overpriced.

As for the service, it's hard for me to describe what I didn't like about it, but I didn't really care for the guy that sat us or the young lady that served us.  It just seemed like they were there to do a job and that was it.  They weren't unfriendly, but neither were they friendly, or detached in a professional kind of way.

I really wanted to love this place, and don't get me wrong, I enjoyed most of my experience here, but I guess I came in with my expectations too high. Although for their prices, at brunch, the bar should be set decently high. ($75.00 for 2 adults and 1 8 year old."}
{"text":"Welcome to the land of bad service no subistutes and salty food should have stayed just a coffee shop."}
{"text":"Yum!!

This is a must for anyone who appreciates fresh food, well prepared. I had ginger waffles that were as light as air and my companion had gruyere mac & cheese with bacon, that she declared, \"the best ever.\" 

The location is lovely, the ambiance airy, the service knowledgeable and friendly.

The only caveat -- be prepared to pay for all this excellence... Our tab for two for breakfast was $35.00."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on our first trip to Cleveland and I'm so glad we did. Everything is amazing. It's the definition of farm to table (they grow their veggies in a garden next door) and they have every type of coffee/latte you could ever want. I got the house made granola with yogurt and fruit - amazing! The pecan crusted bacon is delicious. My boyfriend got the Reuben which was also really good. No complaints at all!"}
{"text":"Excellent Food!! Everything we had was amazing! Will definitely be going back! Love how all the food is made in house and all the food comes from 100 miles!"}
{"text":"Just got home from Lucky's cafe where we met for our daughters birthday.  We were a party of 7 adults and 5 children.  While waiting for our meals, the cook comes out and tells us to take the children outside to blow off steam because they were too loud.  Personally I thought they were well behaved since they were of ages 2-8.  The acoustics in the restaurant are horrible and many tables had adults speaking so loudly I could hear their entire conversations.  They unfortunately sat us very near the kitchen, where the servers were constantly running in and out of.  The rudeness we experience was incredible and even more so considering we had a bill of over $200.  I will never return to this restaurant again and would recommend anyone with children or a boisterous crowd to avoid it."}
{"text":"I just don't get the hype of this place.  Once you walk in, it looks like a nice, quaint little dining spot that you would find in Lincoln Park in Chicago.  Place gets a star for that.  Once you get to the menu, you get intrigued by the offerings.  They look nice and creative along with some very recognizable brunch items.  Then the execution.  Sorry, but I was utterly let down the two times I ate here.  The second visit had me excited on a house hash special.  I seriously drowned that thing in hot sauce to help it out.  I tried other peoples plates and had the same reaction again.  I am a passionate food person but I am not snob.  This place is so underwhelming.  The price point doesn't justify  the execution.  It almost makes me angry.  That being said, I will go to other places."}
{"text":"Our last stop in Cleveland was breakfast at Lucky's.  Another restaurant that is locally sourcing AND growing their own food.  The husband and I got lucky and got seated right away.

This place is pretty small and it's busy.  That doesn't bother me, but if you don't like being right on top of your fellow diners and waitstaff, you may not be a fine.

The menu isn't huge.  It's limited to a few handfuls of choices along with about half a dozen current specials.  The husband had the biscuit which was topped with eggs and sausage gravy and served with home fries and fruit.  I tried it and it was really very good.  He also ordered a side of their pecan crusted bacon and I don't know if I've ever had something that good in my mouth in my entire life.  Seriously.  Wow.

I ordered the special omelet, which was filled with summer squash, caramelized onion and goat cheese and topped with hollendaise sauce.  It was served with hash browns and fruit and I ordered a side of their homemade toast.

I wouldn't have expected those flavor combinations to be so good, but they were.  The hash browns were excellent and had a very good flavor.  I also had a white mocha that was very good (and HOT!).

The prices were a little high for breakfast, but we appreciate the kind of place they're running and it's worth extra for that.

They also had a huge assortment of baked goods and pastries as well.  We came home with zucchini bread."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goddess. The waffles are amazing. I had the Sunrise Cocktail which is a mimosa without alcohol. Great atmosphere. Very relaxing"}
{"text":"I would not give it zero stars even though I can't. My baked mac-n-cheese although $18 was amazing. But it still was $18. 

The server was horrible!!! Zero tip kind of bad. We were seated and told our waitress would be; and told me her name. We see her serving other tables, the ones on either side of us, going behind the bar and chatting, looking around. One time pushing past my wife to deliver food like it was my wife's fault she's never heard of a salad. Finally I flag over the hostess whom I tipped later, finally got us drinks and took our orders. We got our food my wife's grilled cheese looked like it was toasted under the sun on a rock, barely deformed the cheese. You could still see the corners. I had to go to the bar myself to have my thimble of water refilled. After all this our waitress stops to ask if everything is ok. LOL. 

This was our experience and it appeared other people were getting ok service and things were well with them. But for some reason we just had a horrible experience."}
{"text":"Many reviews give this place 5 stars for the food and one star for the service.  They are partially right.  The food ALSO deserves one star.  Quantity over quality does not work.  The \"customer is always wrong\" policy is ridiculous.  Who in the hell does this joint think it is? Places like Durgin Park in Boston have a reputation for rude waitresses, which is part of the ambiance. At least the food is good.
There are many places which serve better meals at better prices and appreciate your business and without waiting over an hour for Luck's mediocrity.

I will never return, but there are enough lemmings and people who see \"the emperor's new clothes\" so this place will continue to be successful-unfortunately."}
{"text":"My husband and I arrived prior to the full breakfast service starting, so our only options were coffee and pastries.  While the coffee tasted like burnt popcorn, I could have eaten one of everything behind the glass case.  Go ahead and treat yo'self!"}
{"text":"Lucky's is as good a breakfast spot as I've ever visited.  WARNING - get there early!  This place gets packed!

I found the vibe to be very laid back a la Austin, Texas.  Our server was super cool and friendly.  

I started with a Lucky's Latte - made with honey, which I thought would be odd, but it was delicious!  We also shared a chocolate hazelnut scone - sooooo awesome!

I ordered the shipwreck, which is a GIANT plate of deliciousness.  It was perfectly cooked and so flavorful, and came with AWESOME bread and great preserves.  I LOVE this dish.  It was a while back, so I can't remember everything that's in it - I just remember I want it again. 

My gf ordered the macaroni and cheese.   It is super cheesy!  She loved it, I really liked it.  

My only regret is that the portions were so big we didn't have room for pecan bacon for dessert.

I will definitely be visiting Lucky's the next time I am in Cleveland.  This is a 5 star breakfast!"}
{"text":"Eh I could really take or leave this place.  It's close to my house and I don't really go that often.  Every time I do I either leave quite a bit poorer or I'm underwhelmed.  My favorite thing is the oatmeal and eggs.  They're amazing.  The oatmeal has this crispy top like creme bulee and the eggs are mixed with cheese and herbs.  Not really sure how they go together but I'll take it.  I also love the ginger chewies too.  Their huge, chewy and full of ginger taste.  
The cupcakes and other baked goods are kinda dry.  I'm not a fan of the buttercream frosting.  It tastes just like straight butter.  I've had the reuben.  It's good but they jacked up the price the last couple of years.  
Their prices are pretty outrageous.  For coffee I'd rather go to Civilization.  It's pretty much the same quality but half the price."}
{"text":"Holy Mac & Cheese Batman.
Best Mac & Cheese ever. EVER. Just in case you missed that...EVER.
Came with home made applesauce...crazy yummy...husband had the special omelet of the day - caramelized shallot, Gouda and the house made sausage....in f-ing credible.
Service was awesome...our waiter was hilarious and helpful...prices were a little steep, but we're from DC so it seemed normal for us.
Go! Get your Mac & cheese on! Now!"}
{"text":"Go get Lucky's. Hangover or not, this place will heal you.  

One thing that I've noticed (and have grown to love) about Lucky's is how consistently great the experience is.   The food is prepared with the same degree of care every time.  The wait staff is polite, knowledgeable, and will always ask if you've been to Lucky's before so they can make sure you order what you want and have the best experience possible.

The floor plan is small (but they'll open up outdoor tables when the weather is conducive). I want to count the wait against them, but I can't.  I mean, it should say something that everyone and their mother comes to get Lucky's brunch on the weekends.   Lucky's does everything they can to get you seated in a timely manner (without trying to rush other patrons).  And when they tell you how long the wait is, that's usually pretty much exactly how long it's been.  If they tell you it's an hour, believe them - set your watch, go for a walk, make a few calls, get a cup of coffee and come back.  

Their coffee is some of the best I've ever had. Dunno why... it just is. 

My favorite thing on the menu is the burritos.  It took me about 10 trips to figure it out, but they are awesome.  Their hash browns are substantial and don't appear to be deep fried.  Their multigrain toast runs a bit extra, but I like to get it to slop up some of that sauce the burritos are swimming in.   Their house-made hot sauce is more flavorful than it is hot. Other tasty options are the Waffles, The Omlette,  Also, the shipwreck is their signature mound-o-goodness.   Price is consistely $12 or so for a brunch, but it's worth it. 

Lucky's opens at 9. The wait for a table begins at 9:30. If you get there after 10,  you could be looking at an hour or more. And they don't have much waiting room, so you might be tempted to leave or go outside. But know this - there is no substitute for it, and it IS worth the wait."}
{"text":"God help you if you have allergies, food sensitivities or anything else that would cause you to ask for your food without something (we actually watched our server recommend mac n cheese as a alternate option after our lactose-intolerant table-neighbors asked for the cheese to be omitted from their brunch platter!)!

This after I was lectured for my (simple) request, because it would be \"too hard\" for the kitchen to leave the eggs off my order. \"It's for your benefit,\" says the server, in almost Portlandia-style fashion. I was starting to wonder if they would need to send the chickens to therapy, to absorb the horrible hurt of me not wanting to eat their progeny. And so our server, the one who was \"taking care\" of us, forced me to order something I didn't actually want. Call me crazy, but I think omitting eggs from a brunch plate is not so insanely complex that a server will force you to change your entire order to make it \"easier\" on the kitchen. 

Newsflash: the kitchen is there to service customers, not the other way around. 

Two stars because my waffles were fine, just not what I actually wanted."}
{"text":"I was confused the first time I went here why the reviews were so great. I'm still confused after visiting a second time. The food has either been not tasty or not impressionable. Our server on my second visit had such a laissez faire attitude; he asked many times how things were but not once did he stay long enough at the table to hear a response or even look at us when he asked his rhetorical question. 

The breakfast burrito was just not good. I had to force it down my throat. There was no kick in that dishThe Brie in the mac n cheese was way too overwhelming. The sausage and gravy was the best item at the table although it really was only average at best. The pecan bacon? What a sickeningly sweet, flaccid joke. It could do for some salt. It grieved me to see that done to bacon."}
{"text":"We had the gingerbread waffles--and by \"we,\" I mean me and my 11 month old. We both ate it and I still had some to take home! It was delicious! The cream on top absolutely makes the dish and the waffle melts in your mouth. The dish was about $14, but if you can stretch it as a brunch I think it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Of course we were excited to try Lucky's, since we had seen it on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives--and whenever we get the chance to try a DD&D restaurant, we're there. SO there.

Unfortunately, it didn't start well because parking is a NIGHTMARE. The restaurant is basically in the middle of a neighborhood so there is NO parking lot, parking is only allowed on one side of the street, and the streets are short. Yuck. Luckily we ended up with a primo spot on our second trip around the block. Unfortunately, it got worse from there.

Lucky's was, of course, lucky to be featured on DD&D, but now it is cursed with being CRAZY busy--good for them, bad for guests in my opinion. I mean, you stepped inside and it was a madhouse. The place is small. Right inside the door there is a bench seat on one side of the aisle jammed with people waiting for tables and/or drinking coffees and eating pastries. In the same aisle on the other side, there are people at the checkout to pay bills and to place coffee orders. And in the middle are more people waiting for tables. I tried to see if there was a main station to find out a wait time or give our names--and saw nothing. After a few minutes, the girl behind the counter told me to move up a bit and wait because someone would be back soon to take names. Lovely. There were also people waiting outside at the picnic tables. Ugh. 

We decided to just get our food to go, because we really didn't want to wait in that madness (especially since we had our toddler with us). We already knew what we wanted to order (from watching the show and reading the reviews) so we ordered the Reuben and the Mac and Cheese. And it was $30. Seriously? SERIOUSLY? It had better be AWESOME food.

Unfortunately, it wasn't. It was good, but it wasn't great. And it certainly wasn't worth the wait OR the $30. Granted, it might have been a bit better had we not gotten it to-go, but food that is supposed to be THAT good should be able to stand up to being a to-go order that is eaten directly outside the restaurant (i.e. no travel time).

And on that note, I told her we'd be waiting outside, and they told us to \"check back in about 20 minutes\" - which, okay, they were coming outside to call people's names for seating, so why couldn't they bring us our food when it was ready? Can you see where I'm going with this? I went inside at 20 minutes, and it was obvious it had been sitting there for a bit. I really think someone should have brought it out to me.

I will say the mac and cheese was the better of two dishes, and I especially liked the applesauce to go on top. However, even though bacon usually makes everything better, the bacon in the dish was almost too salty and overpowering. The Reuben was okay, but nothing to write home about--hubby said the meat was tender, but overall it was dry and not nearly as flavorful as he expected. And definitely not worth $15. 

I was actually  considering giving them four stars, but after having dinner later that night at Lolita... there is just. no. way. Sorry, Lucky's. Better luck next time."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a Sunday brunch. French pressed coffee hit the spot.  The charm and coziness was just what I needed on a cold snowy Sunday . We had biscuits and gravy & the omelet with spinach and mushrooms.  I would say the only reason I didn't give it five stars was breakfast for two was $45.00 . Although it was worth it a bit pricey ."}
{"text":"After Sunday mass, we took my parents here for brunch. Our reservation for 6 was promptly seated. We ordered the waffles, blue corn griddle cakes, biscuits, and the ship wreck. All of the plates were each its own flavorful phenomenon. The biscuit dish (my order) was absolutely divine. 

After dinner, I asked to meet the head chef. My family and I complimented her on a exquisite feast. She then took the time to take my daughters into the garden for a tour where she also helped them make flower bouquets for my mother and I. 

The chefs there grow their own herbs and vegetables which they use in their uniquely inspired dishes. The rest of the ingredients are purchased, the chef explained, from local farmers and growers in support of the community. 

The cafe only accepts reservations for 6 or more people. However, the cafe is a very popular spot and they will allow you to call ahead while you're on your way there. On a typical Sunday, there can be as many as 60 hungry guests waiting outside when the door opens. 

The prices and menu options are not comparable to Bob Evans or Cracker Barrel, so don't expect that when you dine here. Each dish is a large helping of flavorful and carefully crafted deliciousness. I also appreciated the fact that the cafe buys from local growers and grows their own as well. This is a rare, and by reading some of the other reviews on here, sadly unappreciated find. 

Side note, my mother got a bowl of corn chowder that was exquisite. My daughter and I split a side of their bacon, which was unlike any other bacon we had ever had - it had crushed pecans and brown sugar on it. 

If anyone has anything negative to say about anything this cafe, they are better off staying home. My family and I all sampled each others meals and were completely blown away. I would give this cafe more stars if I could. The staff was also comfortably warm and inviting. Our server, the two baristas, hostess and head chef were all very warm, open to conversation, and seemed to take pride in their cafe. 

We will certainly be back. Luckys is one of the treasures in our fine city of Cleveland."}
{"text":"If we had a brunch place like this in the Bay Area, there would be a looong wait ALL the freakin time. During my short weekend visit to Cleveland for family wedding, I was lucky enough to not only find this place, but enjoy their amazing breakfast with no wait whatsoever.

To start it off, the coffee was really good (Black Jack! Espresso + black coffee). I got the mac n' cheese per everyone's recs on Yelp, which was absolutely mind blowing... ESPECIALLY when dipped in their homemade apple sauce. Husband got the omelette with mushroom and spinach... and that simple dish was just.... divine.

What makes Lucky's Cafe really special is the fact that they get the ingredients straight from their garden outside (you can actually see them go out and pick stuff), and they use them to cook your dish FRESH upon your order.

The omelette was especially amazing because of these fresh organic ingredients. The veggies were just dancing in my mouth!! If only every restaurant can have a beautiful/healthy/organic/fresh farm where they can get their ingredients from in the backyard.

The outdoor seating was so lovely too, but unfortunately it was too cold.

We got bunch of scones and breads to bring back to the hotel for the family, and everyone loved everything we got them as well.

WHAT a gem. Way to impress us, Cleveland!!"}
{"text":"Glad to be the 262nd review.

Let's start by mentionning the parking in this residential area is a challenge. 

I had the spinach omelette and it was good and nicley balanced with spinach cheese and all the other veggies. Homemade taters was served cold and little blend in the flavoring department.

Busy kitchen with contant staff traffic walking around the back tables. Crowded and noisy environment, limited brunch menu but gets the job done with great coffee options and friendly staff. 

Lucky's 777 not so lucky as a first visit. But would definitly give it another try when patio weather permits."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and coffee good as well. Healthy portions leaving very satisfied I would recommend trying this place out. Cute little spot with lots of charm!"}
{"text":"If you like Reuben's, then this is a must try spot! It is hands down the best Reuben I've ever had. They literally make everything in it but the swiss cheese from scratch, you cannot beat that. The corned beef is tender and flavorful and the rye bread is buttery and fresh. I can't say enough about this perfect sandwich. Pretty much anything here is going to be phenomenal. I've had the mac and cheese with apple sauce, and it was really good. Super creamy and cheesy, and a surprisingly good combo when you eat it with a bit of the apple sauce. Most recently we tried the biscuits and gravy, and they were some of the best I've ever had. The biscuits were big and flaky and the gravy was savory and delicious, and they came with some awesome home fries. 
The service has always been great and the waitresses are always helpful and friendly. It can get crazy on weekends so get there early! There also isn't a ton of seating, and I would say that it is better for smaller groups. This is one of my favorite places to go when we visit Cleveland, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My first actual breakfast in Ohio, I found this gem on Yelp and was in love!!! They have the choice of indoor or outdoor seating. It was a very rare day when the weather was nice so I decided to sit outside, right next to the beautiful garden where they grow all of their items! The seats were picnic benches with a cute flower pot in the middle. After a few minutes of being indecisive I ended up ordering the gingerbread waffles with water w. lemon. I have no regrets, the food was sooo good and the water with lemon was so fresh!  I had such a beautiful view of the garden. birds were literally sitting on the bench with me (not bothersome). I wish there were more places like this, food is fresh, environment is beautiful and customer service was amazing! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Although the coffee is very tasty. The hours are terrible and the staff isn't very polite.
Everytime we come here, it usually between, 7a and 8a and naturally we want breakfast. 
We're greeted with a snide attitude and a we don't serve food until 9am. But, we have coffee and pastry. 
If we wanted pastry, we would go to the market! 
It's always the same attitude, time and time again. 
I don't think we'll be returning a third time. Between the hours and the attitude I constantly get. It isn't worth the trip."}
{"text":"Stopped by on Saturday afternoon for brunch and it was so amazing! Service was friendly and helpful and efficient - not to mention we got the best seat in the house next to the window! My friend and I split everything, so it was nice to try multiple dishes. We had the corned beef hash, the tuna melt, and the waffles. Everything was delicious - but my absolute favorite was the tuna melt. I can't even describe how good it was. The restaurant is \"farm to table\" so you can expect higher prices, but the quality and flavor of the dishes is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Today I had the pleasure of experiencing one of Tremont Ohio's most delicious cafes.  I was in the area for work and used Yelp to locate a place for lunch when I found Luckys.  What a wonderful find! 

Located on a one way street my first concern was parking as I did not see a lot.  Fortunately I was having a late lunch  (2pm) and found a great spot on the street directly in front of the restaurant.  

I was \"greeted\" by a gal behind the cash register/coffee/pastry counter with a straight face and lack of emotion who told me to find a seat and someone would be with me.  

I took a spot next to a window that faced what would soon be Luckys own garden where they obtain some of their farm to table ingredients.  I could also see several picnic tables which I assume will be full of guests once the weather breaks.  

The waitress came by and told me about the specials for the day with a smile and overall positivity.  I stopped her at \"corn griddle cakes with blueberry compote, lemon curd drizzle, housemade whipped cream and almonds\". You had me at lemon curd.  I paired that with a medium roast coffee (because who said you can't have breakfast for lunch?) and waited with anticipation.  

My plate arrived sooner than expected hot and beautiful , which was good because I was famished.  The presentation was great with 3 large cakes, a generous helping of whipped cream, lemon curd drizzle and the compote contained whole blueberries.  A work of art.  

Eating this dish was definitely more like having dessert and it was worth every glorious bite.  Although my eyes must've been bigger than my stomach as I could not finish my entire plate.  Believe me, I tried.  

I thought it was convenient as the server left a number at my table and I could take it to the front to pay as soon as I was ready.  No waiting on someone to bring the check.  

I did feel 13 dollars was a bit high for pancakes but they were so good I'd probably pay it again.  It's knowing that the ingredients used at this fine establishment are local, fresh, and well put together that makes the price worth it.

While standing at the counter to pay you'll find yourself gazing into the pastry display with endless cupcakes, tarts, chocolate, and many other sweet treats.  If I hadn't been so stuffed I might've taken one or two to go but today was not that day.  

Overall this is a great place for a tasty meal.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I love this place. 
It's small. But good. 
I love they are about local food sourcing and even have their own garden right outside their door!   

It is literally the best quality and the food is made with the most love you will get anywhere!  

the plain coffee is the best around and the foo foo coffee drinks r soooo good(you'll be like, Starbucks who!? Haha)
I also love the iced coffee w/a shot of Carmel and vanilla, yum yum!

Foods I've had....
the Mac and cheese-good, the biscuits and gravy-AMAZING! Reuben was very good, burger that had egg on it was sooo good! The cheese sandwich w/bacon & spinach was good.  

Some reviews complain about rude/bad service.  I can say I've had great servers! I felt they were nice, efficient, they explain everything!  

A bit pricey and always busy when I go, but worth it!!"}
{"text":"I ordered Shipwreck. I was a little skeptical if a savory dish like Shipwreck was going to taste alright since most people ordered entrees on the sweeter side. But I definitely didn't need to worry because Shipwreck was amazing! It tasted especially good with some hot sauce. I also love that entree had some fresh fruits to balance out the savory flavors. My waitress told me that they get their ingredients from local farmers, and she wasn't lying because the fruits were so incredibly fresh and sweet! The cafe itself is also really cozy and adorable. I really enjoyed my brunch here and I definitely recommend coming here and trying Shipwreck!"}
{"text":"By far the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had. My girlfriend and I stayed in Cleveland on a Saturday night and went out on East 4th. Obviously craving a big breakfast the following morning. We called Luckys for \"call ahead seating\" on our way. Walked in, sat right down. Although the food takes a while to come out, it's because everything is scratch made and WORTH THE WAIT. So sit back, enjoy your coffee and know you'll be getting a great, scratch made meal."}
{"text":"We tried this place based on yelp reviews, and the breakfast was one of the best I have every had anywhere.    Try the biscuits and gravy.     There is a beautiful garden where they grow herbs and vegetables they serve.    Great coffee, great service.    You do pay more ~$12-$15 per person for breakfast than you would at Denny's or whatever, but it is worth it."}
{"text":"This place needs to get over itself. They are pretentious and overpriced. I paid $15 for Mac and cheese aka a block of salt just because it was farm to table? No thanks. 

That's cool that their staff is hip and hungover and unappreciative of their clientele. Oh wait, no it's not. 

Get over yourself Lucky's just because you have a tiny little garden thing next door and your servers have stupid trendy leg tattoos doesn't mean that you can overcharge for bad food in Cleveland. Woof."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to grab some eats before we hit the road back to Chicago.  I found Lucky's on the Yelp map, looked at the star rating and hit the road.  And the road hit us back, our car was almost engulfed by a pothole getting here.  We pulled right up and saw that idiot Guy staring at us from a poster in the window.  I thought it would be packed, but we were there with one other person.  The waitress/Chef? came out and told us all about how everything was homemade and how they only used local produce.  We are down with that being gardeners ourselves.  Then we looked over the menu, everything sounded good but a bit on the expensive side.  $12 bucks for waffles? $13 for a corned beef.  With prices like that the food better sing.  And after the local homemade lecture this should be good.  And you know what?  It wasn't that good.  That is why this place was empty.  It was over priced diner food with a aplash of flavor.  The waffle was good, but not great.  It needed syrup even with all of that caramel and whipped cream they loaded it up with.  If you wanted maple syrup it was $4 extra.  $16 for waffles?  I don't think so.  The corned beef was OK.  It was a little tough and cut pretty thick.  The wife had a grilled cheese and tomato soup and thought it was good.  We don't have a problem paying a little extra to eat local, but that was a lot extra.  My wife tells me that you go there for the charm and the idea of eating sustainable, but I think value has to play into this also.
Give it a try but know what you are getting into.  It is expensive food with a cause.  I would try it in the summer when there is more local veg available."}
{"text":"I have been to Lucky's once before. last time the service was bad. this time it was awful. the staff just seems irritated at every little thing. I asked if they could explain the size of the salad. and she says \"i don't know...kind of like this\" and she shows me with her hands but not exactly knowing and then says \"yeah and the whole is two halves\" uhh okay, no way, really?! what a concept! after that I was over her. we had a few people waiting on us and every last one just seemed annoyed at life. we were been being complicated or anything. service is a big thing for me and I probably won't come back regardless of how good the food is. 

that's being said, the food is great. everything is fresh. I've tried the shipwreck it's perfect. the omelette was fresh and tasty. the triple b salad was the so good, and a great combination of savory with a hint of sweet. the potato leek soup was creamy and cheesy and just superb. if you don't care about service and don't mind paying up this is the spot for you. 

the prices seem a little steep for me. I'm from CA and these prices are for the nice fancy DTLA spots that all the hipsters go to, but like I said if you're willing to pay for good food (which I totally am) this place is worth it. but the service was my last strike."}
{"text":"I went here because the reviews said the food was superb and service was average or above. My experience with Lucky's was that the food was ok, and the service was TERRIBLE. Not sure what was up that day (maybe everyone was hungover from the Saturday night before?) but our waiter forgot about us and we had to ask someone to come over and take our order. Long story short, we waited for our food for about 2.5 hours, and when we finally did receive it, I wasn't that impressed. I ordered some egg potato  scramble that had about 1/8 egg...not good. We received a bunch of scones and other desserts to compensate for the wait, but those were just kind of average too. 

Overall, not impressed in any way. For Cleveland, I guess its good? I don't know- you tell me. Maybe you'll have more luck at Lucky's."}
{"text":"Lucky's is everything Guy Fieri found it to be when he stopped in to sample the food. The menu is inspired and eclectic. The guajillo pepper sauce is really a unique mole sauce drizzled over a burrito and delicious! They make there own hot sauce and jam, both of which are worth taking home. The Italian white bread made in house was the best piece of buttered toast I've had in my life!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious - 4-5 star worthy easily. 

The wait time was LONG, but it was a Sunday morning. 

The 3 stars stemmed from the cost. There were 4 of us and a child and our bill was $90!!

NOT budget friendly at all!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I split the shipwreck which was an egg dish that was out of this world.  The pecan bacon was interesting but we were not a fan.  The sausage was very good.  The desserts and pastries looked very good but we passed on them this time.  Maybe next time because there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"Pretty amazing. I saw this on diner, dives, and drive-ins. The food was stellar. The whole place is pretty awesome and very much a quaint restaurant. I will be coming back for the Ruben. The Potato salad is AMAZING...Holy crap it is so delicious! haha...sorry I had to say that."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp! My friends and I took a roadtrip to Ohio from NY last weekend to go to Cedar Point.  We stayed in Cleveland for the night and my duty was to find our eateries.  Reading through Yelp and discovering it had the supposed best Mac and Cheese and then some we had to stop.  My bad on arriving early at 8AM as we were told their kitchen does not open until 9AM.  But the workers were very gracious and we ordered some drinks and just relaxed by their tables and waited as our stomachs were getting anxious after reading through their menu.  Between 4 people (3 females and 1 male) we all shared 2 Shipwrecks, 1 order of the Mac and Cheese, 1 order of their Rueben Sandwich and 1 order of the biscuits and gravy.  Heffer status, I know.  But boy oh boy it was all delicious.  

I'd say the Mac and Cheese beat it all hands down.  If I got to redo I'd have ordered two Mac and Cheese and maybe pass on the Reuben.  The Reuben is good I must admit but I'm a bit spoiled by Katz Deli in NY.  Back to the other dishes, the Mac and Cheese was AWESOME.  Gooey and cooked perfectly.  I don't even know how to explain it other than happiness in your mouth (and stomach).  And the homemade apple sauce that came with it somehow complimented it very well. I'm not big on biscuits but it was delicious here and the gravy sauce was out of this world.  I found myself dipping everything I could in it (toast, potatoes, some of the corned beef...it was good I say).  And the shipwreck was pretty much standard filling breakfast fare.  Potatoes, eggs, sausages all scrambled together.  It hit the spot.

We were told the food is as fresh as possible and they utilized local sourced items.  You can tell.  We even saw them going in the back to pick some fresh veggies to use.  Nifty place.  The wait staff were courteous and attentive.  A definite must stop if you're ever in Cleveland or from Cleveland.  Now i'm just depressed we're so far away..."}
{"text":"I am going to give this place a 5 star and I will give you five reasons for that! 1- I've never had better pancake anywhere else.. 2- They have amazing special menu dishes... 3- They change their menu with the season and bring great additions.. 4) Everything here is organic and straight from the farm.. 5) Anything you get here, you won't regret it.. Also the staff is super friendly and suggests you with the best of things to try.. lol I gave you 6 reasons and trust me there are more than just 6.. I had visited Cleveland over the weekend with my brother and sister in law.. We were looking for a place to have a nice brunch before we headed back to Columbus.. Thanks to yelp! 
It's a cute cafe with a cozy decor.. Our server welcomed us and told us a little about this place and suggested that we order for their house favorites- Baked Mac n cheese, biscuits and gravy and the pumpkin pancake(this was a seasonal addition on their special menu).. We also called for the freshly squeezed orange juice and Thai ice tea.. Going straight to the food.. The baked Mac n cheese took us to heaven! The cheese sauce was so good and thick!! The biscuits and gravy was so good too! The biscuits were soft as cotton and gravy had a very nice consistency.. The pumpkin pancakes stole the show! They were great! They were served with toasted almond slices, blueberries, cream and creme brûlée( that was a party in our months).. Creme Brûlée on pancakes? What?! We had a great experience.. Their last order is at 3PM.. You all should rush for some delicious treats before time runs out! :) 
Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast.  The staff were attentive.  Portions  are generous.  We ate the waffles and biscuits with a side of pecan bacon.  So amazing.  Can't wait to come back. So good that we brought home dessert for this evening from the bakery case on the way out."}
{"text":"The bomb-digity!

Recommendations:
Eat here!
Biscuits and Gravy!
Pecan Bacon!

Tip: The owner's daughter is the artist whose work is on the walls.  They are folkish style paintings of trees that are amazing and, as far as one-of-a-kind art goes, inexpensive.  You should get one. I did!"}
{"text":"Here on a recommendation of my son (Mark B.). We came here for lunch, with Mark. Doesn't look like much from the outside. Go in, it's worth it! Very different menu. I had a lamburger! Very lamby. Well cooked as well, not dense. We each had something different. I tasted everything. All were good! As Cara L. says, as much as can be obtained, or grown, locally, is. Support your local merchants! Good food, good prices, friendly staff as well. For us, it was about a 40 minute drive for lunch. It was worth it. Go, enjoy!"}
{"text":"a little bit pricey, but great food and atmosphere, friendly people!"}
{"text":"Food: I had the Shipwreck, which is a mix of eggs, bacon, potatoes and vegetables with toast and fruit on the side. Overall good, but a bit on the salty side. The coffee was also really good but we were never offered refills. My wife had the waffles with a side of bacon, which was not her first choice (see service below)

Crowd: We went on a Saturday afternoon around 12:30. The place was really crowded but we got seated in about 5 minutes. The layout of the place looks hard to navigate and it's impossible to be anywhere without being in someone's way.

Service: This is where Lucky's fails spectacularly. Below is a breakdown of the experience.

We had a long, \"Portlandia\"-style spiel about how everything is either from the garden outside or sourced within 50 miles of the place. That's awesome but I already knew what I wanted to order. I was almost expecting them to offer to take us to the farm where the livestock was raised.

My wife normally won't eat eggs and tried without luck to order 2 of the dishes without eggs. Both times she was scoldingly told by our server that the kitchen was too backed up and they don't do substitutions. Which apparently also means subtractions. Because it's too hard to leave off an ingredient. She did manage to order the waffles without fuss and even managed to request a side of bacon several minutes later without protest, much to our surprise. The bacon came out before our other food and before they'd bothered to give us utensils, and was put in front of me. When I quickly pointed out to the guy who ran them out that they were for my wife he turned around and left.

During no time were we offered refills on our coffee or water. I was tempted to request a refill but expected I'd get some half-assed story about how they were too busy and that it would put undue stress on the staff. So I lived without it.

As we were finishing our meal, we saw an older couple two tables over trying to order and getting sternly lectured about substitutions even though the woman had clearly indicated to the server that she was lactose intolerant and couldn't have cheese. She just wanted the cheese left off her eggs. After the lecture the server suggested she get the mac & cheese. Um... (!)

So overall, the food was decent, though I've had far better in Cleveland for the price, and the service was terrible.

Apparently to some people being a hipster restaurant means you can be condescending and rude to your customers. Bonbon over in Ohio City is just as hipster but actually values their customers."}
{"text":"It has been a while since I last had brunch at Lucky's. I was in the mood for some pecan crusted bacon, so off we went for breakfast at Lucky's. Even though we came later in the day to avoid normal brunch traffic, the wait was going to be 45minutes for 2 people. Womp womp...but since it was sunny and fairly warm (for CLE fall time standards), we waited outside in the patio area. Even after 40 minutes or so, we didn't hear our name called, so we moved to the inside cramped seating area to wait. We decided to get some coffee from the front coffee bar, but that too was another 10minute wait. After I finally flagged over the barista, and got my order we were finally seated. We got the Shipwreck, Biscuits & gravy, and Pecan crusted bacon. The pecan bacon was oilier than I remembered so I could eat half a slice. The biscuits and gravy were good, but I wish the dish was warmer when it came out. Seems like it had been sitting in the kitchen for some time before the dish was served to us. The shipwreck was ok, but I think the both of us lost our appetites by the time we got our food since we waited so long for everything. With a small menu selection, and us selecting the more popular dishes...I wonder why they don't just make them ahead of time in anticipation for the next orders it? Anyway, we ate a bit slowly, since we were trying to have a conversation over the loud crowds around us. The servers would keep interrupting asking if we needed anything else aka- hurry up we have the next herd to have to feed. I found it quite annoying, and almost wanted to say \"yes I do need something...for you to give us some time to eat in peace.\" After waiting so long, I think it's quite rude to then rush us to eat. To be honest I think we ate in less the time it took for us to finally get seated! Next time I may have to think twice about whether this place is worth it anymore...especially with other restaurants around also serving decent brunch specials. Sorry Lucky's, you need to pull yourself together."}
{"text":"So adorable. Super hipster. Decided to eat here bc of the great reviews while during my Cleveland Trip, located in the Tremont neighborhood. 

Came here July weekend, are here on July 4th. It was cool they were open on this national holiday. The line was pretty busy with maybe 10 people ahead of us, we didn't have reservations but everyone wanted outdoor seating. We were seated right away. 

Everything made here, as explained by our waiter, is homemade/in-house and the ingredients are all from farms within 100 mile radius. Very cool and locale-ish.

I ordered the strawberry and rhubarb waffles! So delicious. Sweet and slightly tangy fresh fruit topping cover my milky and crispy, yet soft waffle.

I also ordered the pecan crusted bacon! Crunchy
And sweet at the same time. I would fly back all the way from the bay just to have these two things again."}
{"text":"Wow! We were visiting Cleveland going to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Christmas Story House (best movie ever!) and wanted to find something before going to the Christmas Story House. The service and food were both incredible ! Farm to table and a small business....doesn't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"I can see why this place has so much popularity from Diner's/Fieri, but honestly it deserves just as much credit without the show! Lucky's is amazing! We came on a Saturday or Sunday I believe, as we were making our way across country (from California-New York) and spent the night in Cleveland. I searched dog friendly places and saw Lucky had outdoor seating. When I went inside there was a huge wait, and the waitress said they were not doing outdoor seating that morning. Nooo! I said unfortunately we had the dog so we had to go elsewhere, but she chased me out to tell me that we could order To-Go and then just sit outside, only difference would be we wouldn't have a waiter. That works for me!

Our order took maybe 15-20 minutes, and we had some coffee in the meantime. The Lucky Latte was incredible; made with local honey, this was one of my favorite coffee drinks I've ever had. We ordered the Biscuits and Gravy and the Shipwreck. Both were incredible. The Shipwreck was an egg scramble with bits of salty bacon, fresh veggies and cheese. It was delicious and the portions are generous. The real star of the show, however, was the Biscuits and Gravy. Not just your average biscuit, these biscuits are cheddar enhanced with bits of scallion, and they have nice texture to them so they don't get lost underneath the gravy. The gravy is delicious, so flavorful and speckled with sausage, this dish melts in your mouth. The hash browns are also very tasty.

Oh Lucky's -- how I wish you weren't just in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Finally got a Sunday off and the only thing I could think of is, of course: brunch. My boyfriend and I went to check this place out and his exact words after a few bites were \"I know I'm gonna have a good day now.\" The food was delicious, we were seated quickly and waitress was very sweet. I got the infamous shipwreck and loved every bite. 10/10 would go again."}
{"text":"Lovely breakfast.  Eggs were fresh, light and flavorful.  Gravy was perfectly seasoned.  Great ambiance and staff.  Might come back tomorrow"}
{"text":"I've been to Lucky's a few times, always for brunch. The food is always delicious, and the specials are always changing. I also like that they try to use local vendors for their food. The servers I've had are attentive but I felt a little rushed at my last visit. I took off two stars because I think it's a little overpriced, and secondly unless you come at the perfect time definitely expect to wait awhile because the space is not nearly large enough for the following they've gathered."}
{"text":"Having read the other reviews on Yelp, my Mom & I decided to stop by here for breakfast after she had a trip to Cleveland Clinic.  It was a little hard to find, but not terribly bad & well worth it.  Good food & great service.  I had the burger which was delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing gem in Cleveland. A farm to table joint with amazing food. There was a long wait to get seated and I gotta say, I'm glad I was patient and waited. Definitely worth the wait. Our waiter was the nicest most genuine person I've ever met. Just her attitude! So positive! She suggest some chocolate waffles with caramel and fudge with bananas to my wife that were so yummy. I had ordered the corn chowder and the biscuits and gravy. And a Papas Mocha. All highly recommended."}
{"text":"The breakfast special is a ham steak, two eggs, hash browns, and two pancakes for $6 or $7.  The buffet is $10.  We eat here when we are too tired to drive to Paris for the buffet there.  It's not great, but it's a decent value."}
{"text":"Cute atmosphere. Went during brunch and had the cuban and the bf had the mac n cheese. Both very good but mac n cheese was amazing, best I've had. Would like to go back during regular menu not just the brunch. It was $30 before tip for our meals with water. A little pricey but not back for a local place. Staff was friendly but not the best service from our waitress. Only saw her when she took our order. Never got more water or asked how everything was."}
{"text":"My brother-in-law took us to this wonderful little place. I am a Reuben sandwich lover! This was by far the best ever Reubens ever!! Everything was grown fresh, made fresh and it was just wonderful! Our waitress was so sweet and helpful
it was very refreshing! I'm hoping we can go back there again for one more Reuben sandwich before leaving Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place during other visits to Cleveland.  I have often wondered why it has such good reviews.  However it was convenient so we went today for a quick lunch.  $12.50 for a grilled cheese with a side of soup - daylight robbery.  My husband had a bowl of the sweetest sickliest corn soup he had ever eaten.  I had a blueberry and coconut scone.  
It seemed like it was a week old; dry, stale, and completely lacking any taste at all.  I asked if it could be freshened in the microwave but no, they don't have a microwave.  I asked if I could have some butter. The response \"well I will have to see if I can find some\".  Really?  

Nobody really cared that the scone was stale.  I was going to have a cinnamon roll but was told they were \"a couple of days old\".  I gave up. We paid and left - never to return!  Very disappointing."}
{"text":"My first experience with a Heather Haviland restaurant was her new East Side location, Vine and Bean. Both locations offer the same weekend brunch they are primarily known for, but this time, I decided to venture out West to try Lucky's Cafe in Tremont for lunch....

After ordering our meal inside and taking a look around the cafe/bakery, we decided to sit outside. Lucky's is a quirky, yet charming little place. The servers are as cheerfully bright as the picnic benches we sat on outside. 

For lunch, I chose the Reuben. Guy Fieri supposedly had the same during a recent trip to Lucky's while filming an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives for the Food Network. 

The sandwich was unlike any other Reuben I've ever had, but in a good way. The corned beef was not the typical shaved meat, but thickly sliced instead. The brisket was brined right there at the restaurant. It was so fresh you could still taste the pickling spices well permeated throughout the meat. Sauerkraut is typically the afterthought on a Reuben. Not at Lucky's. The kraut was fresh, thickly chopped and well portioned. This kraut was probably the best I've ever tasted on a Reuben. Melted swiss covered the sandwich and helped bind everything together. The sandwich sat on the most wonderfully tasting grilled rye bread, which was also freshly made in the adjacent Bakery. A side of house made Thousand Island Dressing accompanied the sandwich.

If Slyman's has the best \"typical\" Reuben in the area, Lucky's has the best \"a-typical\" Reuben, and by far. This sandwich was amazing! The fact that Lucky's put so much time and effort into each component of this sandwich was impressive. A Reuben isn't complicated to assemble, it's composed of 5 typical ingredients (corned beef, sauerkraut, swiss, rye and thousand island dressing). Too often do I find some of those ingredients ignored. Not at Lucky's. It's very evident that much time, love and effort was put into each component of this sandwich and to have discovered a place that  takes their Reuben's as seriously as I do,  I feel, well for a lack of a better term.....  \"lucky.\" 

PS: After starring at the glass case of pastries, I found it impossible to leave without something else. We took a \"Happy Cookie\" to-go. A damn good cookie and a fine way to cap an excellent lunch."}
{"text":"As of 02/23/2010, Lucky's Cafe closed down about 2 weeks ago. They are opening up a steak house in it's place... too bad, I really liked Lucky's. It was a chill little restaurant with good service and good food."}
{"text":"This is definitely a place to go with a few other people with whom you're willing to share food. You should always definitely get the mac and cheese because it'll blow your mind, but when I've come, I've found that I don't want to eat one whole portion of everything. I'd rather get a few complimentary dishes and then nibble around and share. And I don't usually like to share!

I've only come for brunch, but the food I have had is absolutely fantastic. They make some solid eggs, but what I really love are the mac and cheese, the jam they have on the tables, and their hot sauce. We definitely consumed half a bottle of hot sauce during one lunch just because it's that good. It's homemade, smokey, and spicy. 

Next time I go back, I\"ll probably get the biscuits and sausage, but I\"ll probably ask them to hold the eggs. I found the eggs detracted from the flavor, rather than added to it. But I won't go alone! Because we'll also order a \"dessert\" of the waffles to have after we've eaten our solid food :)

Staff is also really pleasant, although crazy busy, so they don't have a lot of time to talk and connect with you, but I can't blame them."}
{"text":"Hosted my sister's baby shower there. Super cute atmosphere, extremely helpful and accommodating staff, yummy food! A+"}
{"text":"I have tried to eat here twice prior (see tips) and was unable to eat. Finally,  on this trip,  I got to eat. I was not disappointed. I had the Lamb Burger for breakfast... I know,  weird... and it was awesome! When you read the description, it sounds really heavy. It isn't. The naan was perfect, the lamb/pork patty was perfectly seasoned and the cheese and spinach was terrific. The staff is kind and generous with their time. I have a new favorite place to eat in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Yelp to the rescue!  My family was in town for a wedding, and none of us being from Cleveland (and hadn't been here in over a decade) we had time to kill and bellies to fill.  My wife took to Yelp to find us a tasty place place for breakfast, and what did she find, but Lucky's.  We went about 8:15 a.m. last Friday.  They were open, but the kitchen did not open until 9 a.m.  We were a tad disappointed, but the lady behind the counter recommended a place around the corner, that turned out to be great.   

After this great recommendation we made it our mission to make it to Lucky's Saturday to try these meals that looked so good on Yelp.  We took our time in the morning (day after a wedding and all) and arrived about 9:15 a.m. and to our delight the place was open and serving breakfast/brunch.  It was already getting pretty hot, so we opted to sit inside.  The decor was what you would expect from a coffee shop in any trendy neighborhood in any city.  Paintings for sale, counter full of pastries and sandwiches.  But we weren't here for the decor we were here for the food!  

The menu was small, but all the options were great.  The four of us all ordered a different meal.  I myself got the shipwreck.  It was great.  It looked like a wonderful nightmare on my plate.  My wire ordered waffles and a side of pecan bacon.  

Now, we need to take a moment to pause here.  Bacon is by definition one of the top three best foods of all time.  So bacon dressed up as nothing more than bacon is WONDERFUL.  Now put that bacon in a party dress, drop if off on the red carpet and give it a bottle of pure happiness. .... Do you need to hear more?  OK!  It was like the best night sleep in your life, like finding a crisp $20 bill on the ground, like hitting the lottery.  I can keep going on and on.  It was that good.  But we will move on.

My father, ordered up some breakfast burrito and was served first at our table.  All I can say is, the must have been good.  He pretty much put them inside his belly before we were all our food.  I can't remember what my mother ordered, but from the sounds she made as she ate (she also had the bacon) it also must have been good.

Now to the service.  It was great.  We were informed \"we work as a team here.  If you need anything feel free to grab anyone, and they will gladly help you.\"  This is a message you get fairly often at places, but one that is never actually put into practice.  A request is normally received with a \"I'll get your server.\" But at Lucky's, this seems to be put into practice.  Several staff members got us water, cleared plates and stopped to ask if we needed anything else.  

All in all, this was a great place to eat some tasty grub.  They grow their own small garden outside (that you can sit by if you choose the outside seating) and buy from local farmers.  If you are from Cleveland, or visiting, stop here in confidence.  The food and service was top notch."}
{"text":"As a visitor from California, I was so happy to check out this little gem! The food was amazing! And I felt so much better about the whole experience knowing that the ingredients were grown on site or sourced from local farms! I'm happy to support the local economy. Overall great food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"It took us a year to finally try Lucky's after seeing them on DD&D. Lucky's fell short after all the hype. We got brunch take out. 50 dollars. I understand that it is all suppose to be home grown and whatever, but where is the flavor? I ended up with the waffles because of the who \"no special requests\" role. They were okay. Just dense waffles. Nothing special. My boyfriend got the mac and cheese and the biscuits and gravy which he thought was very good. I don't think this meal was 50 dollars good by any means. Today, my second visit, I ordered two reubens. My boyfriend loves reubens and works mon-fri when the Reuben is available so I got him one to try later today. At my last visit I was told no substitutions during brunch. Since this was the lunch menu I asked for no cheese on one of the sandwiches. After the girl on the phone was done saying um for 30 seconds she told me no because the sandwich had Lucky's in the name. Seriously??? She assured me it didn't have a lot or cheese and it was on one side or the bread. So I ordered. She told me 15 mind. I told her they can take there time I am coming from Parma. When I picked up the man behind the counter told me good thing I was there be aide they were going to get rid of my order. Really? I got there 22 mins after placing the call. I paid the 27.50 for two reubens and took my food to the car. I opened on the boxes to check out the cheese situation.  Both sandwiches are covered. Both sides of bread and throughout the meat. I wasn't too surprised. What really got me is that I paid 27.50 for 4 pieces of corned beef each between dime and quarter size. And it was stone cold. I expected more to the sandwich after paying that much money. Also, is it really that difficult for you to leave stuff off? It's not like I am asking you to take things off and add other stuff (the actually meaning of substitution). Both times I was there it wasn't busy by any means. It makes me feel like everything is premade due to lack of flavor and this bogus substitution rule."}
{"text":"Great brunch!

What a unique, tiny place in Treemont that should be enjoyed by all!

A few friends from the Bay Area came into town and sought out this place and had nothing but good things to say about a year ago and my wife has been talking about it for a bit as well, so we took advantage of a morning in Cleveland and checked this packed delight out.

Although the place was slammed at 11:30 on a Saturday morning, the wait for two of us was only about 5 minutes.

We were promptly greeted by a cheerful waitress who brought much needed coffee and had tons of good insight on the menu. We both ended up getting the mac and cheese with the optional bacon and it was incredible. That's right. Damn near life altering mac and cheese! I added the side of bacon which had almond and brown sugar on it and I can honestly say I would have gladly paid double for it.

Nicely done! We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Legit, god bless Lucky's.

I think it's a valid statement to say that everything here is good. EVERYTHING. There's a reason this otherwise smaller establishment in the Tremont neighborhood has 600+ reviews. It's literally fabulous. Cleveland has many brunch options, but for me, Lucky's is the epitome of the following:
+ A place to impress your foodie friends.
+ A pretty legit hangover cure.
+ A totally appropriate place for a date or hanging with mom.
+ A place to not totally hate yourself after a meal.

Good friends, good food, good people. The Biscuits & Gravy is probably the best in CLE. The sausage gravy is thick and mixed with eggs, which gives it a satisfying consistency. Sounds a little unappetizing, but it just works. Its also served with a side of grapes... and full disclosure, this dish is so big, you'll need a box and will have a second meal. Oh, and Lucky's is on UberEats. Yes, YOU CAN GET BRUNCH DELIVERED TO YOUR HOUSE. I may have to try that soon. Its tempting."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure when restaurants became like indie bands, but it seems that people get pissed off when their favorite place gets a little more popular and then bust out the Hate-O-Rade and are all, like, \"They suck now. They used to be cool, but now people like my brother-in-law like them.\" Hey people, it's a fucking place to get food, not the Shins.

OK...rage subsiding. That said, I've always had a great time and a great meal at Lucky's. I've never had to wait all that long for a table, but maybe that's because I'm pretty attractive. 

For brunch, I almost always get the Shipwreck and therefore don't need to eat for another two days. That's a pretty good bargain! And I've been told their Reubens are second only to Goodman's. So just go. What, you want another night of Annie's organic macaroni and cheese?"}
{"text":"went there today at 1:10 for lunch with hubby, had the famous mac and cheese  everyone raves about, not that impressed, was on salty side, it came in a glass boat that was 1 inch high and for 13.95  it was not worth the price. Also had the rueben sandwich which we asked for toasted, in which they accomadated. Its not your typical reuben, only 1 layer of meat which was about one fourth inch thick. Although it was tastey, it was not worth 14.75. It also came with small amount of chips, which oddly had fresh parsley on them.  Although the place was only half full with customers, it was very loud.  Will not go back"}
{"text":"I've been searching for a place like this for a pretty long time. They have an emphasis on locally sourced food, it looks like they have a garden that they might collect herbs from in the warmer months. There's a unique menu with uncommon flavor combinations. It's a bit pricey, but this is a case were what you pay is definitely worth it. The macaroni and cheese is honestly some of the best I've had in a long time. It has three cheeses, one of which is Brie, a personal favorite. The veggie burrito tasted really good too, the sauce really made it though. I couldn't peg what was in the sauce but it seemed like a mole with pumpkin spice? The morning drink menu is diverse too, had myself a Thai Iced Tea, and the also had a blood orange specialty soda that day. A bit tart for me, but kind of cool that they have those options. I'd recommend it to anyone honestly. 

Oh, there's baked goods up front and they are far more then you average cup cake or scone. Mouse chocolate bombs, almond lemon layer cake, and the list goes on."}
{"text":"It's a very cute hipster place to grab a bite to eat and a delicious cup of coffee. I ordered the shipwreck and it was delicious. My friend and I ordered coffee and it was never brought to us. We brought it the cashier's attention when we paid and she gave us our coffee to-go. It would have been nice if the waitress came over to check on us when we received our meal so we could tell her our drinks were missing. I understand that it was a busy brunch time but customer service is important especially when diners waited for a long time and we are expected to tip."}
{"text":"Featured on Diner Drive-in and Dives, my wife and I were in Cleavland and decided to give it a shot; worth it. In the middle of a residential pocket, like any other house in the neighborhood you will find Lucky's Cafe. Great hospitality, comfortable ambiance, superb food and friendly service. We shared both the \"Biscuit and gravy\" and sweet crepe with ricotta and raspberry chocolate sauce. as we loved our choices, we decided next day to do the same exercise and we ended up ordering the same two items from the menu. Open till 3 pm only by the way."}
{"text":"i don't know why i've been here as many times as i have. their food is sub-par for the prices they charge. the coffee is great as well as the pastries, and everyone is always friendly. i do also have to say i'm obsessed with their home-made jam and bagels. but- their brunch is hardly worth the wait and does not live up to the hype. Again, over-priced."}
{"text":"Phe. Nom. En. Al. Yummy. There are no other words to describe the happy flavors that danced in my mouth when we went there for Sunday brunch. Even our lattes were excellently made. Don't leave there without trying the pecan-encrusted bacon either. Trust me, you'll regret it if you don't."}
{"text":"Our final stop on a weekend trip to Cleveland from Chicago.  I regret to say I wish we had stopped anywhere but here.  

Things that I would like to see/would have made this a better brunching experience:
-salt/pepper shakers on the table
-ketchup bottles verses mini sized ramekins filled with a tablespoon of ketchup
-glasses for water versus the plastic cup my water was served in
-coffee mugs versus the styrofoam cup my coffee was served in
-non-burnt coffee
-breakfast burritos with less cheese, less sauce and more depth of flavor.  
-more reasonable pricing 
-substitutions 

I wanted to like Lucky's.  I appreciate the focus on sustainable, locally sourced produce and goods.  But when my coffee is served in a styrofoam cup I just can't get on board.  The atmosphere is darling, but that is not enough to make-up for mediocre food and chaotic service."}
{"text":"Could this place be any cuter?

(No. No, it could not be.)

Their brunch is divine, & as much as I want to order from their normal menu, the specials keep snagging me. Like CORN CAKE WAFFLES WITH BLUEBERRY COMPOTE. Seriously, everything on their menu sounds fantastic - & looks it, too, from the peeks I've sneaked at the tables around mine. I would order basically anything here - & I will ALWAYS order the pecan-and-brown-sugar bacon, which one of the best things I've ever eaten. Try the honey latte, too!

Everything is made with fresh &, when local ingredients, assembled into creative & uncommon dishes that you won't find at standard brunch joints. They're committed to supporting Ohio farmers & business, & their food is so well-plated that everything looks pretty & appealing - &, of course, tastes just as good.

Go here for brunch. GO HERE FOR BRUNCH. Stop reading this. You should be eating brunch."}
{"text":"Love the brunch and love the people+atmosphere more.

The omelet is my fave and is always excellent (lots of spinach and lots of mushrooms!).   The banana bread that comes on the side is a fave and I don't even like bananas!  My omelet always goes well with a bit of the \"hot sauce\" (not hot, but great flavor) and a big iced mama mocha.

Great area to hang out and spend a lazy sunny Sunday."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant! Today my wife and I went for the first time and it was fantastic. The quality of the food is more than worth the price, and the service is extremely friendly and insightful. Highly recommended for anyone that wants great food & drink in a very cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had to try this place after we saw it featured in Best Thing I Ever Ate.  Per Michael Symon's suggestion, I had the biscuits with gravy which came with scrambled eggs and a side of potatoes.  My BF got the Corned Beef Hash.  Everything was delicious....the plate was huge and we couldn't finish everything.  

The place is really cute and very laid back and comfortable.  It was nice to see some outdoor seating and they even have their own little garden where they grow some of their own produce.  

It's also a bakery with a case of yummy pastries.  We were flying home to NYC that morning, but couldn't resist - we bought a box of different pastries to take home with us.  My favorite was the lemon tart with fresh fruit on top.  My BF was raving about the Chocolate Mousse Bomb.  We're so glad we made this our last stop in Cleveland before flying home - and we got to enjoy the desserts once we got home.

I recommend that you go early to this place.  We got there at 9am, and by the time we were leaving around 10am, the place was completely packed."}
{"text":"Delicious!  We had the Lucky's fizzy and iced coffee. Definitely try the fizzy. The tomato bisque for an appetizer was my favorite. I could have that everyday! We also had the Ruben and grilled turkey sandwiches. Great! The staff was super friendly. Definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"Great place for your tummy and your soul. Luckys makes you feel good about what you choose to eat."}
{"text":"This is an amazing little farm to table place. I had the waffles with rhubarb compote while sitting next to their beautiful garden. Although the menu is not large, it is so unique and well thought out that I am sure it will please everyone."}
{"text":"I'd give Lucky's 2.5 stars.

In my opinion it's overpriced for what you get. (and over-hyped thanks to Lucky's national tv appearance) Yes, everything is local, freshly made, etc. - as I heard in the 5 minute, unenthusiastic speech given by my server before my meal - but still...

I dropped in for lunch on a Friday afternoon with some coworkers. I thought there were going to be 8 in our party, so I asked for a table for 8. The hostess/waitress literally \"harrumpf-ed\" and gave me a dirty look after I said that. I know larger parties can be a pain, but the restaurant was pretty empty. She seated me outside on a picnic table in the blazing sun. Once my coworkers arrived, we realized our party would only be 6 people and our cubicle dweller skin couldn't handle so much sun, so we went back inside and asked for a table. More audible sighs and glares followed. 

At this point, had I not been with a group, I would have left. But we stayed and had a decent meal. Our server was very ostentatious and at times, condescending. Maybe it's because we were dressed in work attire and she despised us for not being a hipster like her, but our money is just as green. 

I had the canoe wreck, a mediocre tofu scramble with potatoes and about 3 pounds of peppers. I've had better elsewhere. (and could make a much better meal myself) For $13.50, I expected it to be mind blowing, and I was honestly pretty disappointed. In our party, the only person who seemed to really enjoy his meal was the guy who got the grilled cheese with pesto minus bacon. I nearly fell out of my chair when they let him make a substitution. I know how strict they are about not altering menu items. 

For my money, I can get a much better tofu scramble at Grovewood Tavern or Beachland Ballroom and not have to deal with attitude.  I can honestly say I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I lived in Tremont for years but had never had brunch here until last weekend when my cousin was in town. They got there early and got a table and brunch was amazing! My husband and I both had the Shipwreck and it was life changing! We could have easily shared one but my god, was it tasty! We will definitely be going back and taking friends. Get a seat early and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Before you read the entire review I am going to write (which might be long) Ill lay it out very simply and easy...................

Food: 5 out of 5
Employee care/responsiveness: 1 out of 5
Employee friendliness when they were actually at the table: 2.5 to 3 out of 5
Decor: 5 out of 5
Price...................... 1 out of 5 this place is very pricey but in my eyes worth it (if that even makes any sense)

The entire atmosphere when you first walk inside is just NICE and inviting. The place was packed standing room only. We were told the wait would be about 20 minutes, we were seated 5 minutes later which was great. We had a table at the front of the store so we had a good view of the neighborhood and the people in it. 

Very small menu however if you have good food who cares how small the menu is?? After what seemed like a lifetime the waitress came over. She was friendly enough but seemed rushed and flustered.......no problem it was busy. She did seem a little annoyed we weren't ready to order before she even took our drink order but what do you expect I'm a first timer I had questions. The waitress effectively attempted to mask her annoyance long enough to take our order. 

The food took a little while to come which we didn't mind as we simply liked to enjoy our drinks (5 dollar fresh squeezed OJ) and people watch. Our food was delivered by another employee who dropped our food and left without saying a word. 

We ate our meais which by the way were out of this world good!!! I had the biscuits and gravy which I'm pretty sure was the best I've ever had. The bad part was my drink was empty before the meal even came. Our waitress did not deliver the food and did not check on us to see if we needed anything at all. NOT ONCE. She simply arrived after we were all done to drop off the check. That's ok I ordered a drink from the cashier at the counter who was actually very nice. 

So.......would I go back?? absolutely probably every time I am ever in town. Will I be happy about the prices when I go back??? NO!!!!!!!!!! will I expect horrible service if any at all??? YES!!!!! But it doesn't matter the food to me was just that good...."}
{"text":"Overrated.  They sliced ONE biscuit in half and charged 3.95 for it.  They call the \"buscuits\" on the menu. They tastedlike Red Lobster's buscuits.  You pay for the name and ambiance not for the food.  The quality of food does not match the price."}
{"text":"What they said. Didn't really read the other reviews, but I saw there's 182 of them, and I'm assuming they're all about the mac n' cheese. My brother took me on a surprise road trip to Cleveland a few years ago and Lucky's was our first stop. Always enjoyed mac 'n cheese prior to the visit, but Lucky's take totally changed my idea of this comfort food forever. Strangely, I ate applesauce with everything as a child (masked the flavor of icky things like vegetables), but never actually ate it with mac 'n cheese until Lucky's. Suffice to say, I now try to have applesauce around whenever I eat mac 'n cheese. Having had one successful visit, when a friend last year suggested taking a trip out to catch an Indian's game, the first thing I instinctually blurted out was \"Lucky's!\" I can only assume I will continue to make this place a stop whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Lucky's brunch on the weekend is a lot like going to Melt on the weekend, the wait is long but the food is well worth it.  It's a bit on the pricey side for a broke college student but when you factor in that they make everything from scratch and are super into using local ingredients it makes the price not as bad.  
I went here once during the week with a friend and we were the only people in the place.  If you have that option I suggest going that route.  If not, don't show up hungry on the weekend."}
{"text":"If you need a reason to visit Cleveland, this very well could be it. I'm a big Reuben fan, and with that said can be very critical of the corn beef, this was easily one of the best I've ever had. They handpick herbs and spices daily in their community garden. They offer a developed healthy menu, applicable to many tastes (even kids). Cool outdoor patio and spectacular service.

You gotta try this place."}
{"text":"This place rocked my socks off.  I was visiting from LA.  Took my brother after my husband called me and told me that he remembered this place from Diners, Drive ins and Dives, and insisted that I buy my brother breakfast. I never order waffles.  I ordered waffles.  I have not been able to get them out of my mind.  I can't stop thinking about them. They come with this ruhbarb jam. So good.  I look forward to visiting Cleveland again.."}
{"text":"This is, hands down, the best brunch place that I've ever been to in my entire life.  There are excellent brunch places within walking distance of my apartment, but ever since I discovered Lucky's, I've been foregoing these places and driving half an hour to come here.  The biscuits and gravy are the best thing on the menu - the biscuits have a great texture and flavor and the gravy is the perfect consistency and blends well with the eggs.  The breakfast burrito is also fantastic.  Here is a place where I would always clean my plate (and my girlfriend's plate), gravy and all.

The place is packed starting from about noon until around 1:30 pm.  If you arrive between these times there will be a ~20-30 minute wait.  Brunch ends at 3 pm but you can arrive at 2:55 pm and still order.  Even if you arrive at 2:55 pm, the waiters are still cheerful and friendly.

They serve brunch on holidays like Labor Day and Memorial Day.  These days are usually less busy.

They don't take reservations for fewer than six people."}
{"text":"This past weekend my husband and I trekked up to Cleveland to visit friends, which of course meant we needed Sunday brunch! After looking at some menus we decided on Lucky's and we were not disappointed!

When we arrived the place was packed (usually a good sign), but luckily they took our phone number so we could wander around Tremont while waiting. Shockingly, they were right on with our wait time and we received a phone call as we were heading back to the restaurant. 

The food is what really shines at Lucky's! The biscuits and mac'n'cheese are both to-die-for (applesauce and man'n'cheese - who would have thought?) and I dig the farm-to-table vibe. Unfortunately there was no room left in my belly for the delicious-looking dessert... maybe next time! 

Honestly the only downside to this place was our waitress, who spent way to much time describing things in her monotone voice (we heard about how hot our plates would be at least 3 times!) and we had to ask 3 times to get some of the homemade hot sauce. Otherwise service was attentive and as mentioned the food steals the show!"}
{"text":"Over rated and way over priced. Don't wait in line for what they offer. Parking sucks as well. Grapes as a side. GImme a break."}
{"text":"Simply put... the best breakfast I ever had.  Ingredients could not be more fresh.  We had waffles, we had the ship wreck, we had the biscuits.  We also ordered more hash browns.  Everything was an a+."}
{"text":"I had very high expectations for Lucky's Cafe - I've heard nothing but praise, both from real people and fake people like Guy Fieri.  I also am a huge supporter of the local food movement - knowing that they get their products from local sources, grow their own produce, and make most items from scratch, I was prepared to be a huge fan.

We went in on a Monday, so it wasn't too busy and we got a table right away.  I ordered a chai (which they don't make from scratch, disappointingly) but it was very good nonetheless.  Our server was extremely friendly and personable.  Service was a bit slow from the start, with drinks coming out staggered from each other.  The lag time in service was even more noticeable with the food, with at least 5-7 minutes between first plate down, and last plate down.  Admittedly there were 5 of us, so we were a large-ish party, but I really didn't like having a plate of eggs in front of me and then, not wanting to be rude, having to wait 7 minutes until my last dining companion got his waffles.  And his side of bacon appeared another 5 minutes after that!

I got the shipwreck, which is a pile of scrambled eggs, bacon, cheese, peppers, potatoes, mushrooms, and perhaps another few vegetables.  That is normally the kind of breakfast I love, but honestly I wasn't sold by this one.  The scrambled eggs were not fluffy, so essentially the whole pile of food could be lifted off with one fork - everything stuck together in a clump.  The toast, supposedly homemade (and it may well be) tasted like regular diner white-toast....when I hear \"homemade bread,\" I hope for something wheaty and rustic.  The housemade jam was very good, however.  I like how they had a bottle of homemade hot sauce, but it was hard to get out of the bottle - I don't think I ever got quite enough of it.  The shipwreck was all right, but not a dish that really seemed special.  And it didn't really taste \"fresh,\" although I don't doubt the quality of the ingredients.  It just didn't have that made-to-order touch.  I'm picky about my scrambled eggs, what can I say?

My boyfriend got the Reuben, which was quite good - not nearly as a large as most deli sandwiches, which was nice.  I thought his dish was more high quality than mine, each ingredient was well-made and added something distinctive to the meal.  Two people got waffles which they seemed to like, and I had a bite of the pecan bacon which was quite sweet, but yummy and creative.  Apparently the waffles were extraordinarily sweet - one person in our group said he'd ordered the bacon hoping that it would add a savory component to his already sweet breakfast, and he was a little disappointed that the bacon was so sugary as well.  But I liked it!

Anyway, I really wasn't blown away.  It's also a little pricey - I truly don't mind paying more for local, fresh ingredients, but if that's the case then I hope for better taste.  My dish was really quite average, to me.

I really support what they are doing here, and I'd be happy to come back again and give it another try, but I was a bit disappointed in my first visit."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I had brunch just this morning for the first time. Food was pretty good (turkey omlette, b'fast burrito, small soup, a Papa Mocha and a chai), and our server was super friendly; however, the barista who rang up our cheque was rude. I understand she was busy during the brunch crowd, but do I really need to wait wait for my receipt after paying for our meal? I don't think so. Also, their brunch is way overpriced for what you actually get. We won't be dining here again."}
{"text":"The atmoshphere at Lucky's was one of a kind! The staff was excellent, it was our first time here and they were very welcoming. I recommend the grilled cheese with tomato soup it was amazing!  Oh and the Lucky's Latte with honey was the perfect ending to lunch! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for great service and great food try this gem out in tremont"}
{"text":"After hearing and reading rave reviews about  this place I decided to go for brunch on Sunday. Arrived at about 10:15 and got a table right away, the service was excellent. They had a full service coffee bar, I had the ice mama.  They also offered smoothies and fizzy drinks of the day. They had a big specials menu, but we opted to order off the menu. We ordered the gingerbread waffles with apples and homemade whipped cream. And the biscuits and gravy that came topped with scrambled eggs and a side of potatoes and grapes. We also ordered a side of pecan bacon which wasn't our favorite. The waffle was cooked perfectly and absolutely delish! The biscuits and gravy were the best I've ever had. The place filled up quick and there isn't much standing room, so I suggest getting there earlier then later. But you are able to order a coffee drink while you wait. This is a must stop for brunch!"}
{"text":"Lucky's has a couple of signature dishes that seem to never disappoint.  The biscuit and gravy is one of those.  Just rich enough,  a wonderful sausage gravy over the best biscuit this far north. 

A special note about their coffee.  Having frequented a number of breakfast and brunch joints in Cleveland,  I can assure you nobody has a better coffee. 

Lucky's is outside the city core,  nested in a really nice neighborhood.  Parking is hit or miss, and there is sometimes a wait.  Not a bad sign,  come to think of it."}
{"text":"Ok...the service was wonderful, I have no complaints about the service.  The food, is exactly as I have it \"Starred\" above...\"Meh, I've experienced better.\"  How?  Is this just the best brunch in Tremont and that's why it is rated so high?  The space isn't the issue, I'll go to a hole in the wall and wait a long time for an \"Experience\".  We arrived at 9:00 am and only waited for 5 minutes so that would probably be the best time to arrive if you end up going.  Maybe the issue is that we ordered the wrong thing?  My order was Sausage Gravy and Biscuits which, I can make better at home myself, and my son ordered the Shipwreck (Scramble eggs with a bunch of vegetables).  The Pecan Bacon became better tasting as it set.  When it first arrived, being as hot as it was made it way too greasy but I think as the grease settled, it became better (however, definitely not something I would consider addictive or worth coming back for).  The cost is not an issue if it was fantastic, interesting food I wouldn't have found the price to be an issue.  It was slightly better than cruddy family diner food.  Sadly disappointing."}
{"text":"The description that Yelp gives for a 2 star rating is \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" That's exactly how I felt about this place. It has a lot of great ratings but I went there on 4/21/12 with my brother and we didn't understand what all the hype was about.

Positives: 
1) Seems like a lot of people have said that it takes awhile to get seated and for the food to come out, but we came at noon on a Saturday, got a table immediately, and the time the food took to came out was reasonable, not too long.
2) I got the oatmeal, and the bruleed top was awesome and creative. My brother got the shipwreck, and it was also pretty good.

Negatives:
1) This food is not good or fancy enough to be this pricey.
2) Everything is really heavy--the eggs that came with my oatmeal were baked in straight up CREAM, and my oatmeal tasted like it was made w/ cream too.
3) On that note, those eggs were DISGUSTING. It was more like barely cooked egg yolks and spinach floating in a dish of cream. Gross. Barely touched it.
4) They don't let you make any omissions or submissions, which is pretty absurd--they told me I couldn't get an egg white omelet instead of a regular one. Why? They make hollandaise sauce, so they could use the yolks for that. Could they be using prefab egg mix? Hope not, cause that's gross (and would make the prices even more absurd).
5) My brother and I were so excited for the pecan-crusted bacon--what an original and awesome idea. It could have been great.. but it was not. The bacon was soggy, not crispy, and there was no crunch from the pecans because the bacon was mostly coated in a thick layer of brown sugar, with some pecan bits sprinkled in. It was way too sweet.. bad execution of a potentially great idea.
6) The service was eh. I tried to catch my waitress's eye about 5 different times to ask her to bring the bacon before our meals, and it was almost comical how unaware she was. I was making faces, raising my hand and finger.. nothing.

Disappointing!"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and we loved it! Our waiter was so friendly and helpful. The picnic tables were so cute. Even the water cups were cool. The food was delicious. We had the Mac and cheese (so good), the omelette, and the burrito. Everything was great. Awesome portion sizes too. We will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came in this morning expecting a great breakfast before the start to my day, had some of the worst service I've ever had, left basically before I even ordered. What a waste of my morning. Don't have servers that are miserable."}
{"text":"So, my wife and I went to Lucky's Cafe this for the first time this morning for breakfast. We walked in the door and we didn't know if we were suppose to just stand there and wait to be seated so we stood by the front door for about 2 minutes waiting for someone from behind the counter to say something to us. Since no employee said anything to us so we went ahead and took a seat. After we took a seat and waited on someone to wait on us I got up after 5 minutes and went to the front counter to see if someone could help us. I was told that they knew we were there and he would be right with us. So we ordered a coffee and a hot chocolate and they came out pretty quick and then we ordered our meals of 2 Shipwrecks. We asked for some hot sauce and some jam for our meals. He brought them out and the jam was brought out in a very small container that was only half full so I asked for another little thing of jam for our 4 pieces of toast and I was told, \"We can only bring one per table, but once you finish that one I can bring you another.\" WHAT!!!! One per table at a time, WOW!!! That just pissed me off as I'm no little kid being told once you must  finish your meal you can have dessert. That is so stupid. So, I asked for a refill of my coffee and my wife asked for a water and he brought the water but no coffee refill. The food was great but the service was so poor & rude that it ruined EVERYTHING!!"}
{"text":"Okay, my ratings have been really high lately, but I'm only writing reviews for restaurants that really stand out.  I'm giving this a five because the biscuits and gravy were the most delish I've ever had in my life...Done, put a fork in it!  My ex said that Lucky's lucky days are over after being reviewed on the food channel or something.  She may have a point if it was Sunday brunch and you get no attention.  I went on a Monday morning...their hours are pretty weird for a diner.  Anyway, all the ingredients are local...but the gravy was so well balanced.  Not too heavy where it crushes the soft eggs and biscuit below.  The biscuit retained it's texture and was quite crispy below the avalanche of gravy.  I ordered the $13 reuben to go also...and that was possibly the worst Reuben I've ever had....but to be fair, it was a to go-and I didn't get to it until 3 hours later."}
{"text":"My mother brought me here after seeing it on the Food Network.  It was slightly hard to find but I think Tremont is a tricky area overall and I often find myself turned around there.  (Although one time I got turned around I ended up in front of the Christmas Story house, score!)

When I arrived, it was crowded but I found the hostess stand and was seated with in 5 minutes.  After my mom arrived, Patrick our server came over super friendly and took our drink order.  He also gave us the low down on the locally sourced ingredients and all the house made goodies- breads, hot sauce, jam, etc.

My mama got the Shipwreck and I got the Biscuits and Gravy.  Both dishes were huge, a ton of food.  The biscuits and gravy had eggs between the layers.  The gravy was very good and flavorful, although my mother didn't think it was quite as good as her own version. (she's an excellent cook, trust me)  The shipwreck was piled high with all kinds of good stuff, amazing bacon, veggies etc.  The house made hot sauce was perfect for the potato cube hash browns.

Overall the service was great, we waited maybe 10 minutes for our food.  When leaving you can even get a to-go cup for the rest of your coffee.

You pay at the counter which is conveniently located next to a case of delicious looking pasties, scones and sweets.  

They have cute outdoor seating area which I will be back to try.  The only thing that could make Lucky's better would be BYOB - but I think that's just Chicago talking..."}
{"text":"I'm glad some people have stepped up to the plate on Lucky's. I'm a huge believer in \"going local\" but sometimes I am beginning to think \"local\" is synonymous with high prices and middling service.  I used to be a regular, gave them many chances, and just got sick of overpaying for middling service, and average food given the price. 

Let's start with brunch.  If I'm going to pay this much for waffles or pancakes - I want to be able to make some special requests.  I mean, you are approaching NYC prices here, people.  Their \"no special requests\" rule is so, completely, utterly lame and frankly, kind of lazy on Heather's part.  So, you mean, I HAVE to have the pound of whip cream on my waffles?  You can't just, um, leave it off? 

Let's move to lunch.  Sandwiches are fine.  Again, tempered by the price, they move towards the \"average\" range and often \"below average.\"    

Cookies: good, but way way too expensive. Pastries: sometimes fresh, sometimes not.  Always expensive.  You roll the dice.  Coffee: just OK and of course, the theme here is: expensive.  Service: they try, but trying doesn't get there in my book.  I like a nice, quiet place to hang out and have coffee - but sometimes the people behind the counter are friggin' loud.  

Sorry, Lucky's, it was nice to know ye...once."}
{"text":"I visit Cleveland a few times a year and finally had the chance to try Lucky's.  I was so looking forward to this.  What a bust!  the bisquits were ok, the sausage gravy was pasty and did not taste like sausage.  The highlite was the small salad w fresh greens, beets, wax beans, etc...  My niece had the shipwreck which was nothing special.  No more Lucky's for me!"}
{"text":"Good coffee, very friendly service and tons of tasty treats! They have so much seating at Lucky's, inside and outside. Lucky's Cafe seems like a perfect place to sit around and chat with friends on a lazy weekend day."}
{"text":"We got there bright and early on a Saturday, so we didn't have to wait.  The service was really friendly and quick.  The coffee was really, really good and I did have a hard time deciding what to order because everything on the menu sounded wonderful.  

My food was just alright.  We both had the biscuits and gravy and I was a little disappointed. The biscuits were very dense and heavy and I had to use my knife to get through the bottom of them.  (This could be a matter of taste tho... I like fluffy biscuits, while my husband prefers the dense and crispy variety)  The gravy itself was very flavorful, but it was on the pasty side.  The worst part was the potatoes.  They were so dry that I actually had to choke down a few bites.  I probably only ate about a third of my food and took the rest home.  Also, TBH, I really thought that $13+ was steep for this dish.  

I am only basing this review on one visit, but I would definitely like to come back and try something else based on the service, coffee, and menu appeal."}
{"text":"I can't wait to get back to Lucky's. 
Here in the 'nati, we have a place called Izzy's. They think they know Ruebens. I used to think so, too, until I went to Lucky's. Not only is their corned beef ridiculously moist and flavorful, but it's also created in-house. The bread, the sauerkraut, even the pickles are made there. Absolutely delicious.
I decided to split a Rueben and an order of mac-and-cheese with the husband, and couldn't decide which I liked more. You have to love a place that offers mac-and-cheese with bacon in it."}
{"text":"I love sitting outside and enjoying weekend brunch at Luckys. The only downside that I've picked up on is that it seems servers are instructed to discourage any type of special request. I understand the volume of customers can make some difficult, but even simple requests are met with resistance. In the past I was told the shipwreck can't be made without bacon, and today we were told we can't order drinks and food at the same time, one after another, and can't hold the sour cream from the bfast burrito. Food is fabulous, but just a heads up to save yourself some trouble and stick to the program!"}
{"text":"So if you have to wait - simply wait and don't complain! The food is outstanding, the service is wonderful. We had a party of 6 and no one had to wait longer for their order to arrive and everyone was just really happy with their orders. 6 different orders and each one was delicious!"}
{"text":"Got Lucky this morning!  Lucky's Cafe, that is...yep, the very same place featured on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives.  This was my second visit this year....was there in February during the cold weather (Cleveland may be even colder than Pittsburgh!) so it was a real pleasure to eat outside in the garden in the midst of the veggies and herbs and sunflowers with the sun warming our shoulders this morning....ahhhh.  

I had the exact same breakfast I had last time - the Shipwreck.  Big cubes of creamy seasoned potatoes blended with thick cut bacon, mushrooms, eggs, zucchini, onion and blanketed with gooey melted cheddar.  I wanted to get something else this time, but it was so good I just had to get it again.  Next time I swear I'm getting the homemade corned beef hash!  

My companion had the homemade granola.  It was a virtual still-life!   Rolled oats, rolled spelt, wheat germ, flax seeds, almonds, & dried fruits, all artfully arranged on top of yogurt, in a HUGE bowl and then drizzled with honey and an apple that was a sculpture!  And it was every bit as delicious as it was beautiful.  

Casual, artful, fine food in a very cool setting - inside or out, this is a place to be treasured.  Lucky indeed."}
{"text":"As good as I remember...
Biscuits and gravy: heaven!!

Fiancé got one of the specials: ramp and asparagus ravioli. He pretty much licked his plate clean.

I bought a t-shirt. That's how good this place is"}
{"text":"Wow, this is a really great brunch place! There were lots of people out on the sidewalk waiting for a table when we arrived, so my friend and I put our names down for a table and went down the street to explore a bit (we ended up at Lilly Chocolates). We were there for probably like 20 minutes or so before we came back to Lucky's and were seated not too long after. 

The restaurant itself feels a bit cramped, but I think the food is definitely worth it. Between my friend and I, we ordered the shipwreck, baked mac-n-cheese, and pecan bacon. I'm normally not a fan of bacon, but my friend wanted to order the pecan bacon because so many reviewers had mentioned it. I surprisingly enjoyed this dish - it was sweet with a crunch from the pecans (not super salty, oily, or too crispy like bacon usually is - I know, I know...unpopular opinion haha). My friend and I shared the shipwreck and baked mac-n-cheese, which were both really yummy and satisfying dishes! The presentation of these dishes was also really nice, and the lighting in the restaurant made for an overall enjoyable experience! 

Even though the restaurant is definitely busy, they seem to get people in and out of the restaurant pretty quickly. Overall, Lucky's is a super satisfying choice for brunch, and I highly recommend coming to try it!"}
{"text":"We decided to eat here during our vacation in Vegas. We saw a lot of promotion for a half pound of crab with an 8 oz. crab for $9.99! We couldn't pass up this deal so, we decided to go check it out. We didn't realize the fine print that says we had to be a VIP member to get the exclusive discount. 

The food came out pretty good. The crab legs were served a little weird. Usually, you would have to open the crab legs yourself, but they are served in halves so the dirty work is already done for you. Which was pretty nice.

The 8 oz. steak sounded a lot larger than it appeared. It looked like a tiny little steak that was served with some crab with mashed potatoes and 3 pieces of asparagus. 

They could of have been a little more clear about the prices. Plus, there were no restrooms within the cafe. I had to walk across the casino floor to take care of business."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Lucky's while visiting a friend in Cleveland. I had high hopes for Lucky's - a very efficient hostess, good coffee while we waited (in a lovely park across the street), and an interesting menu. Here's where things went awry for us - we had one of the most persnickety and unaccommodating waiters I have ever encountered. Anywhere. Or perhaps it was the restaurant. Absolutely no substitutions - including no option to substitute or simply remove a side of hash browns from the plate! Every request, no matter how nicely requested, was met with a no. So while the food was good and the ambiance interesting, beware of the service - or at least one particular waiter!"}
{"text":"Very good mac and cheese, especially with bacon.  Extremely rich.

Grilled cheese sandwich of the day is usually excellent but overpriced and small.

Service is slower than average.  Baked goods to go are very good."}
{"text":"My parents came into town in late June and were staying at the Strat with the rest of their group.  We decided to eat at Lucky's one night, as it was past 11pm and they didn't want to hop back in the car and go back out anywhere.  
My mom and I ordered the late night special (ham steak, eggs, hash browns and toast) and my dad had the patty melt.  We thoroughly enjoyed our food.  My mom couldn't finish her plate and decided to doggie bag it for the next morning's cup o' joe.  Dad finished his off and so did I.  The server (Sharon or Sheryl - hey, it was a late night) was wonderful, attentive, helped out with her suggestions and even got me grenadine for my soda (cherry coke anyone?).  Overall, we were very happy.

All that, and we paid around a little short of $25.  The restaurant was packed, but we were in and out in less than an hour.  All in all, good eats....for being at the Strat."}
{"text":"We had a family brunch at Lucky's Cafe this morning and we were flabbergasted by their utter unwillingness to be flexible.  I would not recommend anyone with kids who do not have sophisticated tastes to eat at Lucky's Cafe, as you will be overpaying for plain waffles and being asked to spend $5.00 on a side of maple syrup.  The manager was unfriendly, unapologetic and had no interest in seeing us return.  If you have deep pockets and do not have any diet restrictions, this is a perfect restaurant for you."}
{"text":"Had brunch here on Saturday and loved it!We even saw Jemaine Clement from Flight of the Conchords! He was having a bite to eat on the patio with Arj Barker before playing a concert at the State Theatre. Food was amazing, coffee was tasty, service was excellent, and the atmosphere (down to the fresh flowers on each table) was welcoming. Would absolutely recommend a trip to Lucky's."}
{"text":"Fantastic little place to go out and get brunch on the weekend. The girlfriend and I wanted to try something different so we packed in the car and headed down to Lucky's for some eats. I ordered the Shipwreck, an awesome concoction of eggs and amazingness, the lady ordered the super-rich mac and cheese with bacon - both were worth going back for. Now you absolutely need coffee or juice to help you through the mac and cheese as it might be the richest tasting thing I've ever had in my life. I opted for the incredible hazelnut mocha and it couldn't have been better.

Next time I'm in Cleveland, Lucky's is on the list of must-visits."}
{"text":"Lucky's is undeniably the best brunch in Cleveland. The Mac and Cheese is fantastic, the Shipwreck is unbelievable, and the biscuits are the best I've ever had.

The atmosphere is also nice; its quaint, but has some charm that's unique to the Tremont area. It's also great that they support local farms by sourcing their ingredients from nearby neighborhoods.

Overall, it's a must if you're in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"The Shipwreck is fantastic!! The atmosphere is very hip, trendy and fresh homemade food with some awesome baristas.
A must for a late yummy breakfast."}
{"text":"Best mac and cheese ever. Very crowded on a Saturday morn with the brunch crowd. Hipster central. But hipsters gotta eat too. Stopped in because I was hangry and allergic to my husbands parents cats and needed to kill time while he said goodbye to them (his parents not the cats) before we hit the road. Yelped this place up and per usual you didnt steer me wrong. Ordered the mac & cheese everyone raves about and its def a 5 out of 5.

 I had leftovers that my husband devoured. He said it was the best macaroni he's ever tasted. After I got out of my feelings, I had to agree. He could have at least said mine was the best (mac and cheese is very labor intensive but I have made it for him many times) and Luckys is a close second but whatevs. It truly is good good stuff. Very rich and decadent. They serve it with cold applesauce and fresh grapes. Normally I'm not a fan of mixing sweet and savory; I like my foods seperate but equal when I consume them but the waitress was so thorough and personable in her explanation of how to use the applesauce to cool down the pasta (it comes out piping hot) that I tried it. And tried it again. And again. And I couldnt stop dipping. 

What to know. Quarters are TIGHT there is not a lot of waitspace.  I felt like I was in the way no matter how much I tried to twist and turn to not be in the way. They only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. They quoted me an hour wait time but I was probably seated in about a half hour. All the tables turned over pretty quickly. 

If I lived in Cleveland I'd be back for sure. 

Oh, so I also had the dark chocolate cake with salted something or another with buttercream frosting. No bueno. The cake itself was dense and dry and the icing tasted like straight butter and salt with not enough sugar... def not the special sweet treat I had hoped for. My hopes were high because the description sorta kinda if you're reaching reminded me of the old school late nineties/ early two thousands Olive Garden dessert, Chocolate Lasagna that was discontinued.  Nope not even close. Wouldn't get it again."}
{"text":"Saw this place on Triple D and it was probably one of the best clips on the show. Homemade EVERYTHING from bread, corned beef, saurkraut, home-grown cucumbers, which become home-made pickles, which becomes thousand island dressing (along with homemmade ketchup and mayo, of course). Insane!

We came on Sunday at 12:30 without reservations and there was definitely a crowd already. We were told that the wait would be about 45 minutes, but it ended up being only 25. The menu is limited, and I was surprised there aren't side orders available. The place is so small that I guess they really limit what you can and can't do to keep the food coming.

I finally decided on the mac n cheese and the coworker had the biscuits. The mac n cheese was good, but I think it was way too saucy - needed more noodles and could use a crunchy, cheesey topping. The apple sauce that came with it was AMAZING. I would definitely order a bigger portion if that were available. The biscuits were also very good and the potatoes that it came with were delicious. I feel like they were definitely fried in some animal fat and they were nice and crunchy.

We also shared the pistachio cupcake. The cupcake part was a little dry and it was served to us straight out of the refrigerator case, which meant the mound of buttercream frosting was stiff. However, it was SUPER DELICIOUS. It was a raspberry buttercream that was sooo full of bright, sweet, berry flavor - I kept saying that it would be amazing spread over a biscuit. Oh man, that frosting was innnnsane. I want to know how she makes it!

We saw Heather running by a couple times, which was great and I would love to come by in the spring/summer to see their gardens or partake in a brunch outside. 

Super cute neighborhood. Would recommend to out of towners, which was what we were. Prices, as other yelpers said, is quite high, not only for breakfast, but even more for Cleveland. I was a little taken aback, even for someone from DC where food is expensive. But if it's locally grown/homemade, you are definitely paying for that and that is a good thing."}
{"text":"This is the only DDD I've been to twice and I live 600 km away.   Why?  Biscuits.  Scallion Biscuits.  The sausage biscuits and gravy is the best breakfast I have ever had.  Everything is right.  Even the eggs were perfect and fluffy. The gravy is one of those things you wake up the next morning craving.

In addition, I have also had the reuben which is made from scratch.  Every ingredient was divine. The saurkraut  was fresh and flavourful. The corned beef was among the most tender I've ever had.


The waitress was brand new and was getting used to things but she was not afraid to admit it.  The rest of the staff was great. as well.  I had a long conversation with one of the chefs whose passion was radiant and encouraged me to let him know in advance when I'd be back.  I'm looking at dates already.  

Both times I got baked goods to go and haven't been disappointed.  I ordered a peach cobbler this time and it was surreal. The cookies were not as good as I remember the first time but still quite tasty.  I also highly recommend the  homemade hot sauce. It is not overly processed and has a fresh-picked taste.

Above that, it's great to look out the window and see a large herb and vegetable garden with at least one employee weeding, pruning or picking most of the time.

In the words of my mom, I guess I drove 600 km before I had the biscuit."}
{"text":"I really dig the feel of Lucky's. Planted in an rehab happy neighborhood, you can definitely tell this place is loved by the locals. With a menu full of creativity and fun flavors, I was excited to try out Lucky's for brunch. 

My family and I sat outside and enjoyed the adorable patio packed with picnic tables and umbrellas - a huge help and respite from the sun. With a tart yet sweet lemonade in hand, we took a bit of time taking in the scenery. Folks from all walks of life were enjoying their meals - definitely a nice site to see. 

Our server was quirky yet friendly and helped me decide on the mac & cheese. A short while later I had a trough of baked penne set in front of me. The flavors were fan-freakin-tastic! Incredibly creamy yet a bit spicy (thanks to the recommended side of hot sauce) and there was plenty to share. My issue with the mac? It was pretty runny - almost soupy. I imagine it would have been much more solid if given just a few minutes to cool off. However, the side of grapes were fresh and the homemade cinnamon apple sauce was just about perfect. 

Even though I keep hearing that Lucky's is impossible to deal with for those who have food allergies (no substitutions) I think it's definitely worth a trip to check out the menu and their local focus."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Killer biscuits and gravy. Seriously. If you like B&G, you're going to love these. I also recommend the mac and cheese. Dip the macaroni in your applesauce. It sounds weird, I know, but it's delicious.

Waitstaff was super friendly, coffee was hot and delicious, and the atmosphere was awesome. We went on a monday morning, so we didn't have to wait for a table or anything, which was great, but I would've been willing to wait for those biscuits,"}
{"text":"Lucky's is on my top ten list if best places for breakfast or brunch. Why? You can get scrambled eggs and bacon just about anywhere and not be terribly disappointed (it's damn hard to screw up breakfast). Lucky's is a shining star because the folks who run it are creative. The menu features fanciful delicacies like the Shipwreck - a plate filled with what seems to be everything + plus the proverbial kitchen sink. Try the Canoe Wreck if you don't do meat.

Their espresso bar produces delicious lattes. Their home made hot sauce is wonderfully sweet and savory. Their pastry case... yeah, about that!

They finally have waitstaff - no more having to go back to the counter and wait in line for more good stuff! 

Lucky's rocks my Saturdays and Sundays. Bring friends and show them this gem in Tremont!

Oh, bring a bottle of champagne - Lucky's does BYOB!"}
{"text":"Comfy, cozy, great cappacino, delicious bfast, friendly staff, loved, will go back, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I LOVE a small menu. If you're anything like me, you're terrible at making decisions. Don't get me wrong, I love choices, but every once in a while I want simple and fantastic. Which is exactly what you will find at Lucky's. They have a great selection of breakfast beverages. Coffee, tea, fancy coffees and teas. Plus it comes in giant cups! Anything that makes my hands look super tiny makes me chuckle.

I had the fancy grilled cheese. A wonderful spin on a classic! Swiss cheese with grilled onions and spinach. It was supposed to have blue cheese on it as well but I ordered it without. No blue cheese for me, thank you. The tomato bisque it came with was creamy and delicious. Definitely great for dipping the sandwich in!

I have not had the waffles yet but I hear they are quite fantastic. I will be back to tackle those in the near future!"}
{"text":"We went to Lucky's Cafe because of its appearance on DDD. The brunch did not disappoint. From the delightful atmosphere to the attentive service, it was an overall fantastic experience. The portions are huge, and they were reasonable when it came to substitutions, and they even had soy milk for coffee --BIG BONUS in my book. I just don't understand why there is still a surcharge. It's just good karma to throw in the milk your customer can have if they are already ordering a big breakfast, but that's a minor detail. The potatoes were perfectly crisp and well seasoned, and I was over the moon that there were some healthy options, including a veggie omelette. We also bought a package of granola as a gift for someone. The granola was also great, but holy cow on the price! Definitely not something we would buy again, but it was a nice one-time splurge. Although we sat inside, it looked like there was a lot of outdoor seating in the back, and there was also a nice area to get coffee and pastries to go. Since I'm not one to order pancakes and other bread products, I cannot judge the quality of the more carby menu options, but if you're look me and love brunch and are always on the hunt for a healthy choice at a place where your dining companions have other, equally tasty options in the carb department, this is your place!"}
{"text":"UNAPPETIZING AND EXPENSIVE! If the food was amazing then I wouldn't mind paying an extra dollar but wow this is just so unsatisfying that my boyfriend who loves burgers didn't even finish more then half of this burger. The service was the worst I've ever had in my life. I simply asked to have different eggs on my biscuits and gravy and she said no. My boyfriend asked for no mushrooms she also said no. This restaurant does not care what so ever about pleasing the customers. I decided To get the biscuits and gravy anyway and not eat the eggs... the biscuits where denser then cement and was just the most subpar meal I've ever had. My table was dirty when I sat down also. 2 entrees and 2 drinks for 37 dollars??? Is this some kind of hipster joke because I'm not laughing. Safe to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"tremont is one of those neighborhoods that is studded with mom and pops, and lucky's is the paragon. great food, quick service and a friendly staff.

it's become tradition to have sunday brunch here when I visit my friends lakshmi and brion.  i always get the breakfast \"burrito\" which really isn't a burrito: scrambled eggs in a tortilla shell, drowned in mole sauce and baked in a casserole, served with potatoes.

make sure you check this place out if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"My first visit to Lucky's Cafe and I'm thoroughly impressed. I started out by getting Lucky's Late which had the perfect amount of sweetness provided by locally made honey in a generously large mug. 

The portion of the Shipwreck was equally generous and the quality matched the quantity! You can really taste the freshness of every ingredient used. My experience was top notch from the late to the main dish to the side of fruit. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really love this place. My favorite things are the fizzies (any  flavor), gingerbread waffles, and baked mac and cheese. There are a few specials i have passed up and regretted it after seeing someone else order it, so don't  pass those by! Their desserts in the front counter  are pretty good, but I would recommend walking down the street to lillys chocolates to get some dessert instead. The coffee here is also good. I enjoy the caramel creme breve drink. I will say the waiting area and the register placement are incredibly frustrating so i will take off a star for that. You  are constantly bumping into people so you get agitated when you are waiting for a table  and when you leave. But the middle part, where you eat the delicious food, almost makes you forget...."}
{"text":"BISCUITS AND GRAVY! 

If you like biscuits and gravy, this is your spot. So so good here. The biscuits are tender, herby goodness and the gravy is just salty and creamy enough. Heaven!
The Shipwreck is also awesome. Anything I've ever had here is awesome. Espresso drinks are very good as are the scones and other goodies. 

Cute and homey atmosphere. They source what they can in season from their own garden outside and it's awesome to sit outside on the lawn for a meal in the summertime. Be prepared to wait on summer weekends though, the secret is out about this place. 

They even make their own hot sauce! Probably the best thing ever. 
We make a point to take out-of-towners here for a meal - they have good options for everyone (vegetarian, vegans aren't left out.)

I note a lot of people saying that the service is crabby or snooty. Honestly I haven't experienced this, but I tend to avoid at the crowded times so maybe on Tuesday mornings they're nice because they're grateful for the table? I also totally understand the frustration with the no substitutions thing. I also think this is lame and for that reason, have to take away a star. In my experience the food is 5 star but that's just because I'm lucky enough to not have food allergies or intolerences. In solidarity with those less fortunate in these areas, 4 stars for you. 

The only complaint is that their listed hours are misleading - yes, they open at 7, but only for pastries/coffee. The real show doesn't start until 9am."}
{"text":"Outstanding! The Reuben sandwich is by far the best I have ever had. All homemade! Service is great and will visit again!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for breakfast or brunch!  They had pecan and brown sugar crusted bacon for pete's sake!  Oh, and you have to try their ginger cookies. They are to die for.  I absolutely love this restaurant but don't come on a sunday morning... way too crowded."}
{"text":"This place is quaint! On our binge weekend of checking out new places we haven't been to, we stopped by today for breakfast. After reading some other reviews, we called ahead on the way so we didn't have to wait. Menu is small but seems to have something for everyone. I had the blueberry French toast he had the biscuits and gravy. Both were very pleasing, but the price point turned us off. $16 for my French toast, $14 for his, and another $5 for one coffee, put us around a $40 breakfast! I can't say it was worth the money, but it was nice to check out a place I have been dying to try for years. I appreciate what they are doing by using local and in-house ingredients. Not many places do that these days. Food was excellent but again, not sure it was worth the expense. We may be back when the weather is better and sit outside in the garden and have a meal but probably for a special occasion."}
{"text":"What an amazing brunch. The shipwreck is fresh and delicious. I strongly suggest a side of the pecan bacon. Fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"I ordered the lucky burger. I was a little disappointed but it was ok. I am giving this place such a high review because of my service. Rachel, the tall girl was great! She was so attentive and friendly. She also suggested some delicious pastries to go! They made up for the less than average burger!"}
{"text":"It was in the Stratosphere - where I was staying. It was 5am. We were hungry.  Granted, I only got coffee and fruit, but the service was great and the server was very nice and accomodating, especially since we kept messing with her, in a good way of course.

If there's nowhere else to go, why not."}
{"text":"Lovely cafe... seating is a bit crowded. The food was good and the changing menu always allows for something new."}
{"text":"Well let's start with the fact that I love this place, as a matter of fact on a recent trip to the area, it was on my go to list, and I did.
I love the fact that they grow as much as they can in their garden, or get it from local farmers.
I love the fact that they are part of a slow food movement that fills my heard with joy, and they take reservations, and credit cards.
The staff was knowledgable about not only their food, but food in general. 
The place had a great vibe, and a really nice decor, and a great wonderful patio (next to the bountiful garden).

I went with my wife, and a friend, all of your meals were very good. My wife was especially happy with her breakfast, because it covered her requirements of savory and sweet.

Our server was really excited about the pecan bacon, it was good (for the love of all that is holy it is bacon), but for my taste it was a little sweet, and I have have better bacon.

My dish could have had a little more spice, but by no means was it a bad dish. A few drops of the home brewed hot sauce, and I was off and running.

This is they type of establishment the country needs more of, and if your in the Cleveland area you should eat at Lucky's (often)."}
{"text":"A little hard to find because it says Mosaics on the side of the building you're approaching. Went for Sunday brunch. Totally packed with maybe fifteen waiting in this small cafe but turnover was pretty good. They'll ask you to vacate the table when done, so no lingering! LOL
. Fortunately we were a party of six with a reservation. No reservations for smaller parties. Parking wasn't too bad, on street within a block or so. 
   Waiter was awesome. Cool bald dude. Very friendly and extremely competent. Minimal selection with NO substitutions, made of all natural, home grown or locally sourced ingredients. Food was excellent except the pecan-crusted bacon was a little too weird for me after the first bite. I got the Omelette with mushrooms, zucchini and spinach. Like I said, no subs. I would have preferred no mushrooms, as would a companion diner, but the only option was an omelette with butter beans. It was easy to pick out the 'shrooms, though! Otherwise it was delicious! The cider was really good, too!
  One had the turkey sandwich and loved it, except it was covered in gravy which was unexpected, and he had to eat it with a fork instead of as a sandwich, and others had the Shipwrecked, a scramble of eggs and LOTS of veggies. 
  One was REALLY looking forward to the corned beef hash, but they were out by 11am. On a Sunday. Not good! 
  Nobody really liked the pecan crusted bacon, and we'd each gotten it as a costly side because we're all bacon lovers. But this had a scary look and was too, well, sweet. That was the only drawback. Oh, except for no substitutions, though as busy as they were you can understand why they have that policy.
  This is one of those places that gets a lot of word of mouth but I probably wouldn't go back because of the small selection.
 I also noticed they list themselves as \"wheelchair accessible.\" well, maybe when they're empty, and only at one or two tables at that. I'd be prepared for some difficulty if anybody in your party is in a chair."}
{"text":"A hidden treasure in Tremont, Lucky's is a great spot to get breakfast/brunch at. Very cozy on the inside, great place to go with friends or even on a nice day date. Food was delicious and decent portions, a little more expensive then your standard diner food but still worth it :)"}
{"text":"This place was delish! Limited indoor seating, so a long wait if you visit on a rainy weekend morning like I did. The solution? Grab your coffee from the front and enjoy the wait."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with anything in this place. The staff is sooooo nice and always a warm welcome. The coffees and bakery items are all fantastic. Their breakfasts are huge and also absolutely delicious! I love this place and is a must to take out of towners."}
{"text":"We used to love Lucky's but today was definitely a let down. The staff was complacent and pretentious. We stood waiting to be acknowledged or welcomed as several staff members stared at us or walked around us. I have a food allergy and when I asked the waitress if the shipwreck could be made without eggs, she laughed at me and said that it was pre made, contrary to their mission statement, and couldn't be done instead of offering any sort of help. The food was not up to its usual standard as well. The Mac and cheese was way too salty and soupy. The biscuits and gravy were covered with green onions and came with the tiniest side of potatoes. Don't think we will be going back!"}
{"text":"Teeny bit over-priced, very unnecessarily busy, but still very delicious and worth checking out. Their lattes are truly the best latte I have ever had in my 28 years."}
{"text":"The little cafe in Tremont is NOT to be overlooked! It is such an inviting atmosphere and everything is so fresh! The coffees and lattes are super! I recommend the lucky's latte with honey in it! I never thought honey in coffee would be good, but now I try to recreate this latte all the time at home.

Sit outside at the picnic tables if you're lucky enough to make it here on a seldom  warm&sunny Ohio day!

The Lucky Reuben, House-Made Granola, and Shipwreck are not to be missed!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to try Lucky's Cafe. After seeing it on TV we planned for 2 weeks to go without the kids. It was really a let down. The prices were very expensive. $4 extra for maple syrup for the waffles? I ordered the $12 omelette with potatoes as hard as rocks and my partner ordered the vietnamese grinder. Neither were that good nor were they worth the money. No wonder there are no prices on the website. I'm so disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Lucky's is one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland. I have to say, I loved it a little bit more back in they day before it blew up. There were couches and the vibe was just a lot more chill. Now, the place is constantly packed with people coming from who-knows-where and it's just a little bit stressful sometimes. And man, I just really miss those couches.

My two favorite dishes here are the mac-n-cheese and the waffles.

The mac-n-cheese is perfect. Heavenly. Decadent. I want to bathe in it. I want to eat it every day and weigh 400 pounds. I want to eat it and take a 2-hour nap after. Every. Day.

The waffles are what I get if I'm looking for a sweeter brunch/lunch. They aren't TOO sweet, and the caramel sauce is just a little bit salty. Always a winner.

Ideally, I go with someone else who agrees to indulge me by ordering one of these two dishes. Then we share and I get both of my favorites in one freaking meal. Hallelujah."}
{"text":"where to start...
 
I came in late on a Monday morning for some breakfast with one other person. They have about 5 things you can order for breakfast... Waffles, biscuits and gravy, shipwreck, canoewreck and kids breakfast.. all of which probably have more calories and fat then most fast food meals... 

I tend to eat pretty healthy BUT in large amounts so I wanted to order the Shipwreck ( big pile of eggs, veggies, cheese, bacon and potatoes ) without the cheese and bacon.

I was told they couldn't do that. Mind you, I was not trying to substitute, just subtract. 

I asked if I could just get an adult sized scrambled eggs, potatoes and toast. A simple item on nearly every breakfast menu in America. NO.

I asked if I could get the kids meal ( scrambled eggs with cheese, potatoes, and toast) with no cheese. NO.

I said OK, just bring me the kids meal ( $9.50 mind you, In Cleveland!! )

When the food FINALLY came, it literally was about one scrambled egg with cheese MELTED on TOP with 5 or 6 small cubes of potatoes, one piece of toast cut in half and slivers of a pineapple and strawberry, that wouldn't fill a tea spoon, plus a small orange wedge.

It took a long time to get the food and once we did no one came back to our table at all.

This place has potential (location, strong coffee, attempts to use wholesome fresh ingredients) but the service is horrible and the food choices pathetically limited.

Even in San Francisco or Los Angeles I can get most anything I want at breakfast for $9.50 and get it just the way I want it.


- they took our coffee order but had to request water ( which they only brought to one of us )
- never was offered coffee refills

The \"manager\" who we paid up front said I couldn't get \"no cheese\" because that would ruin the smooth operation of the kitchen and also that Heather ( the chef/owner I presume )  didn't want her recipes altered. Scrambled eggs with cheese is a recipe??

Lame, very lame.

I refuse to go back anytime I am in town to visit family and friends and will let everyone I know to not take any business there, until service is improved."}
{"text":"Yummmmmm! What a tasty brunch, and it doesn't get more farm to table, than this place. Downsides- it's small, so you'll probably be waiting for a table, and saddest of all, they don't have a liquor license, so no mimosas for brunch. They attempt to make up for it with great coffee and a variety of non-alcoholic drinks."}
{"text":"If you want brunch in Cleveland, look no further than Lucky's cafe! The place is packed on the weekends, which is a testament to how amazing the food and service is. 

My favorites on the menu are the mac and cheese (best I've ever had) and the oatmeal (they brûlée the top of it!). I've never really liked oatmeal, but i ALWAYS get it at Lucky's. If you're feeling adventurous (and you're very hungry), go for the shipwreck, another great menu choice.

 The staff is so friendly and nice, they're very accommodating and always have smiles on their faces. Every time I go here I always strike up a nice conversation with my waiter/waitress.

One of my favorite places in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"As I'm scrolling through my past activity on Yelp, I noticed that I have somehow not written a review for Lucky's cafe. Well that needs to be rectified NOW. 

I lived in Cleveland for five years, and this place was my favorite brunch spot for three of those years. If you're a brunch person (specially vegetarian) like me, you will not be disappointed at Lucky's. Food is farm to table and fresh! They have some incredible dishes like the shipwreck. Heck, even the Mac and cheese is delicious. Ratatouille is sometimes featured on the menu and honestly is the best I've ever tasted. 

Now my staple at Lucky's was their waffle. The waffle flavors are seasonal (so I would recommended that you call and check ahead of time if you may not care for a flavor) The blueberry waffle is INCREDIBLE. A personal favorite.

The coffee is flavorful. Pastries to go are always a good idea! 

It is a bit pricey. Wait times can be long, specially on the weekends. So plan to hang around for 30-45 minutes in those times. But trust me, food is worth the wait and price. 

14/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"My fiance went to lucky's 2 years ago and then never told me about it until yesterday. I was both happy and sad. The nut pie is going on my \"list of things I can eat forever\". 
Dear universe, 
please never let this place close.
amen."}
{"text":"The waitress only came by to check on us once. Didn't offer jelly or anything for toast. $13 for a grilled cheese and soup! Pretty expensive stuff. Not many vegan or healthy choices at all, not many choices period. Tofu scramble was okay, way too many veggies not enough tofu or potatoes. Ordered hash browns and got home fries. Good location. Clean. Friendly enough. Won't go again."}
{"text":"We stopped at Lucky's on our last day in Cleveland, and while the food was good, the service left a lot to be desired.

I enjoyed my omelet quite a bit - great fresh ingredients, lots of flavor, and perfectly cooked. I also loved the pecan bacon - but D didn't like it at all. He felt lukewarm about his \"Shipwreck\" scramble, finding it a little boring.

Service was very slow to take our order, and a little rude actually, and never came back after delivering our drinks to bring milk for the coffee - we actually had to go around and find it from another table. We sat outside, in a very pretty garden at a very sticky table. We did also get to listen to the complaints of several other diners, which is interesting and entertaining, but not always encouraging."}
{"text":"Waffles! Yum!!  Service outstanding.  Wait was only 20 minutes for the 2 of us on a Sunday for brunch and we went around noon.  If I am ever back in Cleveland, I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Very tasty place with local homemade food. It is quite pricy but everything is delicious so it's a nice treat once in a while. The shipwreck provides a large amount of food!! Definitely leftovers"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place. Biggest issue this visit was price (followed by service). 

Stopped in with my wife for brunch/lunch. Last stop (breakfast) a while back, I was really impressed and had to come back. Somehow 2 BLTs (with chips), a cup of coffee, a lemonade, and a carrot cake cupcake came to about $39 (+tip). 

The sandwiches were a special, my fault for not asking I guess...and should have asked again when we were rung up, but I didn't. Almost better if it was a mistake in math. But the service didn't help either.

Service started out great but quickly disappeared. I asked the waitress to add a sunny-side up egg on my BLT (\"um, I'll check, but they don't really 'do' changes back there\"), so it came stock. Once the food came out, she disappeared rather than checking on us or refilling my coffee. (I know it's not Denny's, but there are 10 tables in the place.) We ordered dessert at the counter (fine) and they brought it to our table (cupcake was very good). 

I get the whole \"farm-to-table\" thing (and really dig that most everything comes from the garden out back), but there are a ton of great CLE places dong that and nailing everything else. I really want to love this place (again), maybe it was just a bad experience.

Everything was good, but not $40-for-2-BLTs good."}
{"text":"One word: Shipwreck.

No, this is not what I am after I leave Lucky's.  It's what I eat when I go there.  Though the first time I went I believe I ordered it because it accurately described how I felt at the time.

The first time I stepped into Lucky's was on a breezy Spring Sunday morning, which was having a craptastic beginning.  I thought I wasn't going to make it there to meet my friend James before it closed, I had inadvertently knocked my phone into a glass of water the night before (don't ask) and was now frustrated without the technology I sadly admit I am so addicted to, and I was generally having a shite time in general, so I was definitely lucky to come upon Lucky's when I did.

The Sunday morning crowd was definitely bustly, but it added to the charm for me.  The coffee and bakery aromas were amazing right through the front door, and I ordered some strongly caffeinated concoction that would get me through my pending ten hour work day.  I ordered the Shipwreck (a ginormous skillet concoction with eggs and breakfast potatoes and cheese and all sorts of goodies), and James and I decided to sit outside.  I shook a bunch of cinnamon into my coffee, and we ventured out to relax in the sunshine and wait for our meals.

The sun, the breeze, the casual picnic table and umbrella setup in the back with the beautifully muralled fence and the giant backyard garden (!) beginning to sprout, and the happy people all around me created a little Eden for me, a respite from the hectic stress that defined my Spring.  I found myself embracing having no phone, letting some of that stress go, and really enjoying the conversations I was having with my friend about the future, about work, about life.

And that's really just the atmosphere and amazing coffee talking.

The Shipwreck was amazing.  A huge portion, and each ingredient prepared perfectly before thrown together to create this cacophony of flavors.  I definitely had leftovers, which I got to eat for dinner in the middle of work that evening.  And I specifically remember the jam they gave me for my toast; this homemade cherry-something concoction that just made my fruit-loving mouth WATER.  SO good.

I've been there on several occasions since and each time have utterly enjoyed the experience.  Lucky's, you get a Big Fat FIVE.  Not only is the food, the drink, and the atmosphere spectacular, but Lucky's has the power to actually make you feel, well, Lucky.  Even in the midst of feeling more yucky than lucky.

Turn your Yuckys into Lucky's?

(Okay, that was ridiculous.  :p)

Oh, and PS, I hear the tofu version of the Shipwreck is the Canoewreck, and I think that is FANTASTIC.  :D"}
{"text":"Came here while visiting friends. Got a breakfast burrito. Coming from California I have my standards set pretty high and this was not anywhere close to adequate. I guess it was because I was in Cleveland. Our waitress was named \"Sunshine\" not sure if thats her government name or not, but I'll give out a star for that anyways. I also got a little pissed that when you order coffee you only get like a half a shot glass of cream. I wanted to go into my Ron Burgandy mode and say \"Give me all the fucking cream you have back there.\" now, what you heard is that I would like a lot of cream, what I said was \"Give me ALL the fucking cream you have back there. Jesus criminy. I guess they grow their own vegetables from some garden attached to the patio where we ate. Novel.  Shorty and the couple we were with all got the shipwreck. They liked it. I guess Im the odd man out. It was ok I guess, but not worth the long ass wait. Go here during the week maybe its less crowded."}
{"text":"Close your eyes and imagine for a second heading back to your home town, back to that same place you go every time you're around for that food that always reminds you of your childhood.  Lucky's Cafe is that place... on culinary steroids!

This quaint little place  looks rather unassuming from the outside (it's tucked between houses on an otherwise residential street).  But from the second you walk through the door you're embraced by the smell of fresh coffee.  The pastry case calls out to you, it's sirens' song of fresh muffins, scones, and other sweet delights screams for your attention.

You sit, and are confronted with a menu upon which you notice all of the classics from pancakes to omlettes and various other concoctions that would be found on a brunch menu.  The options are daunting.  Local, farm-fresh ingredients lovingly prepared into flavor-packed deliciousness.  And remember how I mentioned the coffee?  Numerous coffee house drinks are available served in over-sized mugs.  The black coffee was good and strong, and was enough to hit the spot.

If you are a meat-eater do not skip the pecan-crusted bacon...  sweet, savory, nutty, melt-in-your-mouth, streusely goodness.  Other personal favorites include the \"Lucky Reuben\" which though slightly different in it's preparation from other restaurants features house made corned beef and possibly the best thousand island dressing this reviewer has ever had.  Watch for specials like the goat cheese, sweet corn, and blue oyster mushroom omlette, a filling and satisfying breakfast meal all in itself.

And now the down side...  this is a 4-star review after all...  Though the decor is comforting and the servers friendly and knowledgeable, the kitchen is slow.  This is not a place you're going to be able to grab a quick bite on a Saturday before you dash off to the airport to catch a plane.  Plan on a lengthy wait for a table, and on nursing the delectable cup of coffee that you'll order.  The food is coming, albeit slowly, and you'll be glad you waited for it when it arrives, and that first glorious bite passes your lips."}
{"text":"Alright, I'll admit that I'm judging this place on just 2 dishes and 2 drinks, but that was enough to fall in love.

Their mac 'n' cheese is satanically good. It is too good. It makes me want to cry. It's wonderful, gooey, silky, ever-so-slightly sharp, with chunks of brie hiding on the bottom, all surrounding perfectly al dente ziti that ooze forth their brilliance when you bite into them. And the savory creaminess is balanced b y a sweet hot sauce, and a mildly sweet applesauce. Perfect.

And the waffles with whipped cream, caramel and apples is beyond words. So good.

If you had a massive heart attack polishing off these two dishes, it would be a noble death indeed."}
{"text":"The waffle was tasty. The waffle could have been a a little crispier but I didn't ask. LOL. The service was fast and the sever was amazingly friendly. The restaurant was not too busy today unlike the weekend. I will definitely be back again and again because I love this place. 

Lastly, if you are not hungry just stop in for hot or cold beverage, you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Super yummy! I love that they focus on local ingredients and make everything from scratch. The service was wonderful. We only saw the weekend brunch menu, so that's why I am giving it a 4. We had the gingerbread waffles and the Mac and cheese. Both were delicious! We will go back."}
{"text":"DO NOT MISS Lucky's cafe if you're ever in Cleveland. Amazing food for any time of day and the price is right. They grow veggies right out in the back and they make more of their food locally and from scratch than not. Supporting Lucky's is supporting a force for good in the world.

The waffles are fantastic. The shipwreck is a gigantic pile of awesome on a plate. Everything is wonderful. You could throw a dart at the menu and it would land on something awesome. The portions are NOT small-- you might be able to split something.

The coffee and coffee-like beverages are also amazing. Their chai is fantastic.

The service is great! You might have to wait a bit for a table depending on when you show up, but it's only because the place is packed so don't take it personally. Everyone's friendly and eager to help out. Definitely a busy atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am completely impressed by this restaurant. Their service was impeccable. The food was delicious. AND I got to sit next to their garden. Great spot. I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend told me about Lucky's and I was hesitant at first. But it's just sooo adorable! When I first went here, I felt like I was a manic pixie dream girl in a cute indie movie or something. Or a little girl who rode her bike to a cute cafe with her golden retiever. Or a southern belle who is on the road to her next adventure and had to stop for lunch and it ended up being a totally rad adventure.

This place makes you feel some type of way! I had the best tea I ever had here before, it was called fruity something? 

The coffee / lattes here aren't that great. I mean, the baristas need to up their game with latte art and such. I wish they served food longer too and had a LITTLE bit more on their menu.

Overall, it's a nice place. It's not really the best location, so if you come here, plan ahead. We went on a day the Tremont farmers market was going on, so that was nice. Come early to get brunch and tea, and perhaps sit in their garden. It's so dreamy."}
{"text":"A must try in Cleveland! They have morning brunch hours and afternoon cafe hours. I went during Café hours and it was quiet and spacious (great for studying). Barista was super helpful, nice, and patient with my indecisiveness. Lucky's has an amazing selection of sweet treats and a cookie called the happy cookie! Very clean area and has outside seating. I had the toasted coconut crusted lemon tart with fruit! Cute place and definitely want to try brunch!"}
{"text":"some friends and i recently had brunch at lucky's cafe after wanting to for quite some time. 

i agree with others that the shpeel at the beginning from the waiter was unnecessary. we already knew about lucky's farm to table approach and was one of the reasons we wanted to visit in the first place. we were hungry and the information was already on the menu so the 5+ minute presentation by the waiter made him (and the place) seem pretentious.

i had the breakfast burritos. they were sweet (maybe cinnamon?) and although they weren't bad by any stretch i really wanted something spicier. i didn't really care for the sweetness. the home fries/roasted potatoes were cooked well but a bit under-seasoned and there wasn't a salt or pepper shaker to be found.  

my boyfriend had the biscuits and gravy which was exceptional. one friend had the shipwreck which he enjoyed and another friend had the chicken salad. 

it is a really cute place but pretty pricey - two breakfasts, one coke and one water was $30. they had fabulous looking tarts, cookies and pastries but for $2.95/cookie and $4.95/mini tart we passed. i would probably give it another shot but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed eating here. Saw it featured on a Food Network show and, since our kids live just east of Cleveland, put it on our to do list and finally were able to eat there. We got there early on a Sunday as we were on our way back to Detroit, a bit too early! They are open for baked goods to go earlier than the restaurant starts so we sat and had coffee until then; as a plus we were able to find parking on the street right outside the front door.

I ordered the Biscuits & Gravy that had been featured on the show and was not disappointed; I may have trouble with same at other restaurants in the future. The Pecan Crusted Bacon is an absolute must! My wife had the Shipwreck and found it to be overly salty but the server took it back immediately and the chef re-made it after agreeing that it was too salty; much better the second time. The staff are very friendly an accommodating so it is difficult to get upset with them, and did I mention scratch made and delicious hot sauce and ketchup as well as their fresh herb garden? I just wish they would move to the east side."}
{"text":"I was defeated by the Mac and Cheese. I must insist you include bacon in yours!

Great atmosphere and unique menu, enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Two visits, two very different experiences. Both times, weekdays after the lunch rush with things busy but tapering off. Visit#1: Couldn't have been better--great service, nice meal (mac & cheese), good wifi. It was a pleasant way to wind down from a busy schedule. Visit #2: a few days later. Totally ignored for 15 min. The people behind me (who came-in later), were waited on, but the server vanished before I could turn around. so I left. I had to get to the airport--if I'd had more time, I would have attracted attention. The place had different crews on each visit, so consistency seems to be an issue. I'm a Cleveland native who has reason to come back often--the kind of out of towner they might want not to ignore."}
{"text":"Very high quality ingredients but wish the menu had a better breakfast selection and some healthier options -- all the food is locally grown/raised, but that doesn't necessarily translate to healthy (e.g. carbs and cheese on everything). Regardless this place is a great spot with not too bad a wait and good service."}
{"text":"THE BEST CAFE IN CLEVELAND IS LUCKY'S!

I had the biscuits and gravy and it was incredible.  The food is very fresh and homemade just like your mom used to make.  The service was impeccable."}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy, that's all. Order it and you will not be disappointed. The lines are super long and the restaurant is small, so get here early or expect to wait."}
{"text":"Came here on a random Saturday afternoon with my BF. The food here is absolutely delicious. I got the biscuits and gravy and my BF got some kind of omelette and hash browns. We did have to wait a while to be seated but the staff was nice. My only complaint is that there were a lot of flies... in the dead of winter. Someone might wanna check on that."}
{"text":"Solid brunch place, I've been here a few times with friends. I've had their mac n cheese and shipwreck, I don't know how I manage to finish the entire plate because it's pretty big. I guess there's the food coma afterwards. Pretty heavy, but I guess that's typical of brunch food. Would like more menu options!"}
{"text":"We had the curried chicken salad and grilled cheese with tomato soup, it was amazing!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed one of the best breakfasts in my life here on Thursday. The ingredients are all locally grown (you can taste it too), they make their own bread, are locally owned, the staff is eager to tell you their story, and the atmosphere is hip. This location is only 5min from Downtown Cleveland in an upcoming neighborhood called \"Tremont\". Just do it!

*I also heard that their coffee is amazing."}
{"text":"Our party of 6 went to Sunday Brunch this past weekend.  As usual, the restaurant  was completely packed however, we waited about 20-30 minutes was seated promptly.  The baked good case is definitely the highlight.  EVERYTHING looks so appetizing and delicious.  We got coffee and chai tea while we waited for our table.  

I got the omelette which came with a side of potatoes and banana bread.  The potato hashbrown is similar to home fries but they are grilled to excellent perfection.  The banana bread was disappointing though. There was no banana flavor.  

The special was the corned beef hash.  DEFINITELY a must get.  The corned beef was excellent.  Full of flavor and not overly salty. The poached eggs and hollandaise was perfect as well."}
{"text":"Awesome, rare find. I mean, how many restaurants in the Cleveland area have an on-site veggie garden? A little slow with service at times, but that doesn't take away from the fun, hip ambiance and yummy food. I had the breakfast burrito and it was delicious. I ordered a side of bacon and freakin' hated it... lol but I generally don't like to mix sweet and savory, and I can see why people would love it. Their jam/marmalade was to die for. I'm going back asap even though I live 25 mins away."}
{"text":"I love/hate the place and have very mixed feelings. It's a very cute date spot and the staff is very friendly. I love that they buy local products grown in ohio. The coffee is the same quality as starbucks though and the prices are just outrageous for what you're getting. The place is packed most of the time which makes it noisy sometimes to be able to hear what your company is saying."}
{"text":"Best food anywhere..and I've traveled all over.  However nothing on the menu is healthy--lots if butter, cheese, and cream used!"}
{"text":"I went here with my sister for breakfast after receiving multiple recommendations from coworkers. One word. Divine. And the biggest food coma that I've ever experienced afterwards. I'm not sure if all of the waitresses push this, but I think I heard the words \"farm to table\" and \"locally sourced\" at least a hundred times. As you can tell, I'm still giving this place 5 stars because the food was THAT good. I had the breakfast burrito and my sister had the special bolognese. Both were excellent. I also got a side of the biscuits without the gravy because I couldn't resist all the reviews. They were good, but probably not as good without the gravy. My options were limited at this place because I don't eat pork and the waitress told us they don't do substitutions. If your a pork eater, many more options are available to you on the menu. Also, if you come before 11, there's practically no wait! And then you can sleep away the rest of the morning, you'll need it, trust me ;)"}
{"text":"Items Selected:
Oatmeal Raisin Cookie, Ginger Chewie
Blueberry Corn Muffin
Pumpkin Brioche Bread Pudding with Currants
Ohio Sour Cream Apple Pie with Vanilla Oat Crumb
Ohio Sweet Potato Pie with Toasted Meringue
Salted Caramel Brownie

Tucked away on Starkweather Avenue in Tremont, the space itself long and shotgun straight with a nextdoor garden patio built for al fresco dining when the weather is right, Lucky's Café offers a limited menu beginning at nine o'clock in the morning daily, the more intriguing aspect of the restaurant being a collection of baked goods sold for dining-in, or to-go from a counter up front.

Focused on local sourcing and scratch production, daily specials often presenting the market's best ingredients both in the dining room and from the glass cases up front, it was just past 8am on Monmday that I entered the empty space to peruse the options, the start of breakfast not to begin for an hour and thus seeing seven items ordered in two courses, the staff nice enough to rewarm as appropriate, though the lack of a Microwave means this entails a short wait.

Apparently visited by Guy Fieri in 2009, his suggestions offered boith online and in-store, it was at a small table near the kitchen that I sat to enjoy the selections, a few patrons coming and going for Coffee or Office orders, free WiFi providing entertainment as bites of two cookies proved well-crafted while the Blueberry Cornbread was unfortunately far too mealy to eat.

Receiving hot Bread Pudding after approximately ten minutes, the hefty wedge of Pumpkin Brioche punctuated with dried Currants amidst Custard-soaked cubes beneath a toasty darkened top, suffice it to say that the thinly-sliced Sour Cream Apple Pie is another selection worth the wait for warming, a Salted Caramel Brownie presented more like a flourless Cake Slice topped in Nuts and Icing while the Sweet Potato Pie rivals the best in the business with a lightly sweetened base juxtaposing the nearly weightless Meringue topping."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in specifically for the Reuben sandwhich and were not disappointed!  This was my husbands first time having a Reuben and I was happy to tell him this is exactly how a Reuben should be prepared! The bread was crisp and lightly toasted, the corned beef was melting in my mouth and the dressing was freshly prepared. The sauerkraut was obvoiusly homemade and was very mild. We also shared a key lime tart that was fresh and had the perfect balance of tartness and sweetness. Very happy we had the chance to experience this place it is a gem and we highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"My friend treated me to lunch here.  This is one of her favorite spots in Tremont, and I can see why.  It is a very quaint place.  Food actually tastes and looks homemade and I believe they use local ingredients.  I ordered the bacon mac and cheese.  Our food took a long time to come out. The mac and cheese was pretty good but the cappuccino I had was amazing. Everything was a little too pricey for me so I probably won't be frequenting this place often."}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal.  I probably go here at least twice a week and I get the same thing - The Shipwreck.  Heather and company do a great job, and I don't think I would recommend any place in Cleveland for brunch rather than this place.  A great choice between baked goods and coffees, you can really enjoy yourself in this cozy little joint.

Weekends tend to get crazy, because everyone wants to be here - but show up on a late morning on a weekday and see what's happening, it's an unbelievable place to get some food and some work done.

Try it, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We recently here on a Monday afternoon at 1:45pm. We were excited to stop in as we had seen them on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives recently and thought it would be fun to visit the next time we were in Cleveland. First, I would like to say that we are from a very service friendly area so maybe we expected more then most, but I'd like to think that's not the case. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and told to pick a seat. There were 6 of us - 4 of them live right in the neighborhood. Our serve greeted us right away and sat a plastic tent with a number on it on the end of the table, didn't think much about it at the time but it was important we'd discover later. 

We were quick to let him know the reason we had came there and that we came to the area a lot to visit family and loved to eat out!!! Well, we waited for a response but none came. You would think this would be the perfect opportunity for him to tell us abut the restaurant and their menu but no explanation came forth.

We proceeded to order and true to his personality he simply took our order and that was it!! We tried to order something without sauce and was rudely told \"no\"! The chef would refuse. Hmmm. Our food was delivered - 2 wrong items and barely an acknowledgment of the mistake 
Overall it was a dismal experience. Not one person that worked there acted as if our patronage mattered."}
{"text":"I am always on the hunt for great brunch places, and Lucky's did not disappoint. I already can't wait to go back!

My dad and I went around 11:00am before a Brown's game one Sunday. The place looked packed and we were worried we would not be seated for a long time, but they were able to seat us within 5 minutes!

Our waiter was attentive, knowledgable and personable. Good service always makes an experience that much more enjoyable for me. We let him know we wanted to split meals (a common practice for my dad and me) and that we were thinking the Shipwreck & Biscuits. He said these were their two most popular dishes so we trusted his opinion. He added that we needed to try the Pecan Bacon so we said why not.

The Shipwreck was delicious, but fairly standard. The Biscuits were the most mouthwatering biscuits & gravy I have ever had. I will go back just for this dish. Lastly, I am SO happy we got the Pecan Bacon. It a must have with any dish you get - SO GOOD!

Cleveland has quite the brunch scene, and Lucky's is one of the best I've had!!"}
{"text":"I am not overly impressed with Lucky's for how much the food is. The French press coffee was pretty good"}
{"text":"Lucky's Cafe is a true gem! I was visiting Cleveland with a friend and after a long night out, we decided we needed something really hardy and enjoyable. Somehow, we stumbled on Tremont and what a quaint little town. 

We parked down one of the side streets around noon and walked over. It was a warm and sunny day, and there were plenty of people outside relaxing and enjoying their coffee. Just by the look of it, you could tell there was a wait, but obviously there were people willing to do it - so we stuck around. 

After we put our name down, we were told it was going to be about an hour, but the line moved pretty quick. We were at our table in less than 30. Luckily (get it... Lucky's Cafe...), you can buy a coffee or a specialty drink while you wait in case you really need your cup of Joe. 

We decided to wait until our meal, and we're so glad we did. This is one of the few places were you can get French Press coffee at your table. It was a very strong cup and I may have grown some extra hair on my chest as a result of it, but well worth it! The coffee is amazing! 

I decided to get the omelette and my guest got a tofu dish. When the omelette came out, it looked a little small, but after I started eating it I soon began to realize how dense it is. It came with potatoes and banana bread. If you like banana bread - this is your place to go! The whole meal filled me up very snugly! 

To be honest, was it the best meal I've ever had - no. It's good, but not flooring. They do make their own 'hot' sauce (which isn't really hot at all), but it was good as well. They're a small business that's working hard, has a lot of loyal customers, and traction to move forward. For two basic meals and a coffee my bill was over $40 - a very expensive breakfast for sure. I don't mind paying for meals, but this just wasn't really worth it. 

If I was in the area again, I would go back, but I don't see myself going out of my way to go back. The town is quaint and enjoyable, so I could see myself in town again - just not running back for Lucky's."}
{"text":"This place has its interesting idea - according to the waitresses, they make breakfast food using their own vegetables that they grow in the back yard. As much as I would like to believe in it, I was a little skeptical about that statement. Cuz that would have required a giant farm to support vegetables EVERYDAY!

Anyways, this place is very busy, and the lines are always very long. I tried two different options on their menu and I think I like the shipwreck the best. I would highly recommend that. Other options were ok. It is a bit pricey compare to other brunch places in Cleveland but the portion size was pretty big too, so I guess it is a fair price!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the food at Lucky's.  They make amazing brunch food, they have a focus on local foods, and they have a fantastic garden where you can eat at large picnic tables.  

I live down the street and we go here fairly regularly, but I really cannot stand their service.  Every time I come here, multiple things go wrong and the waitstaff is friendly but completely powerless to right things that should be a) preventable and b) easy to correct.  Also, their prices have crept up steadily since being featured on national food TV shows.  I'm willing to pay for the amazing food, but I feel like every time I go here, it's a crapshoot with the service.

I'm sad to say it, but I really find that I can't count on this place to deliver consistently in any area other than the food, and in my opinion it makes it not worth the trouble to go there.  They have plenty of business, so I don't feel bad not going there.

Other great brunch options nearby: The Flying Fig in Ohio City, the Tap House in Tremont, Bon Bon Bakery in Ohio City, and now the Black Pig in Ohio City."}
{"text":"My first time at Lucky's was a success.  I came in for a hangover breakfast on a rainy Monday.  The huge mug of coffee paired with a mango iced tea had me feeling rehydrated while waiting for my meal.  

Everything looked really good on the menu-as they were serving both breakfast and lunch.  Debated on the special: pesto/mushroom/swiss grilled cheese but went with the Canoewreck (a veggie version of the famous Shipwreck) with curried tofu.  It was a lot of food served with 4 slices of their como toast as well as a slice of watermelon, pineapple and orange.  We both enjoyed our meals.

The service was excellent, maybe because we were there on a not-so-bumpin' morning.  I had no complaints about the place at all.  It would have got the 5th star had it not been so pricey for breakfast.  For the 2 of us, it was $33 including tip.  

Wish I could have sat in the picnic area outside, but I suppose I'm gonna have to wait til spring for that.  After looking at these pics, I'm pretty sure I'll be mowing on their reuben on those picnic tables next spring."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch yesterday. The food was good, but the service was not. Our own server tried handing or food to another table and asked two other servers which table ordered the food it... she left the table before my friend could ask a question about her food and she was abrupt. She brought us the check without asking if it was together or separate and walked away without looking back when we asked for it to be separate. I think her name was Lisa. She didn't seem to have time for us."}
{"text":"Brunch & Kitchen open until 2:30 pm (I'm pretty sure, but I would call to double check), but the bakery is open until 5.  Based on my experience with some of the baked goods, I would come before 2:30.  We arrived around 1:45pm on a Saturday -- no wait.

Ordered the smoothie made with seasonal ingredients (I want to say mine had mango, yogurt, and strawberries -- and it was frickin' delicious), the shipwreck (so good) with the homemade bread and the out of this world jam, & the strawberry rhubarb cheesecake (truly NOT delicious).  Our server definitely encouraged us to try the strawberry rhubarb cheesecake because they make their own special cheese (or something like that), so we were excited to try it, but man, it was awful.  It was thick and crumbly with a dry overcooked crust.  Anyway, I think I tried something else from the bakery towards the front, but can't remember what it was, and I don't think I cared for it.

The free jam they put on the table is made in house, and you can purchase a small jar of it for around $8.  I don't really care for jam/jellies/preserves, but this was super delicious, I actually purchased it even with the fancy farmer's market price.

Speaking of prices, most of the stuff here is local/organic, and the prices reflect it.  Do I think it's a little pricey? Absolutely.  Would I come back?  Yep.

P.S. I just saw from another Yelper that this spot was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, and I've been to my fair share of DDD eateries, and have been deeply unimpressed.  But don't let Guy Fieri's questionable taste hold you back, check this place out!"}
{"text":"I definitely agree with lots of reviewers complaining about the mediocre service and the inability of the kitchen to handle ANY substitutions. I know they were busy, but I used to wait tables, chefs don't like dealing with substitutions, but guess what, within reason, they should be accomodated! To make a request to have no cheese on an entre', like my friend made, and it can't be done, when you're paying this much for breakfast, is just stupid. The waitress was totally overwhelmed. When I was a waitress, when you're busy, you use a simple rule: never go to your area empty-handed - think before u go as there's certainly something u need to bring. Time and time again our waitress came to our table and the two surrounding tables totally empty-handed! Each time neglecting to bring straws, water, our drinks, our silverware, and s&p despite multiple requests for each from us or from the adjacent tables. She actually told me she couldn't find a pepper shaker and that was that, she couldn't find it so I didn't get it...a place that serves breakfast and its OK that u can't get any pepper, OMG, just awful!  

And for breakfast food, prices are now pretty high. I had the shipwreck which is now over $12!  The menu indicated that it was served with \"a side of fresh fruit\" and we received their normal Portlandia spiel about their emphasis on fresh and local, so I was surprised to find our meals accompanied by a slice of orange and pineapple!   Hmm, last I looked it was blueberry, melon and peach season.  I think that qualifies as talking the talk, but not walking the walk. Makes me wonder what else is not local.

The place is tiny, but could be managed. Here's my advice:1) Have seating out front for patrons to sit or install a few benches in the little park across the street; 2) Utilize the hand-held buzzers so commonly used by restaurants today; 3) During busy, warm days set up a serving table outside with cups and a large cooler with ice water; 4) During weekend mornings, have TWO people taking names/seating people with the person taking names OUTSIDE THE FRONT DOOR. With a tiny, difficult to maneuver place and the restaurant packed with waiting customers, seems like a pretty simple concept whenever possible to not have the host inside the restaurant.

We were willing to wait for their delicious food and put up with the mediocre service, but so many of us milling around inside or outside the front door in the heat, absurd. Another reviewer wrote just a week ago, sums it up well: impossible to be anywhere without being in someone's way. People wait in a line inside just to put their name on the wait list in the same space as those waiting to pay, waiting to check on their reservation, those waiting to be seated, and those purchasing bakery. The host calls the names inside then goes outside (fighting their way through a packed front area of those paying and waiting to put their name in) and calls the name 3 or 4 times, then fights the crowd again to come inside or go outside to seat the party and all this time people coming in to leave their name or check on their reservation have no one to greet them, creating a further bottle-neck so wait-staff can't get in or out. I saw on multiple occasions parties of 4 or 5 fought their way inside when their name was called only to find out their seat was outside, but they were unable to get out! This my friend is the definition of bottleneck as well as a poorly managed restaurant!  A buzzer and/or 2 hosts would solve much of this problem. It often took the host 10+ minutes to locate a party and get them seated. I should know, we watched it occur repeatedly during our hour long wait!  

As the 7/22 reviewer said: so many things that could be done more efficiently are not...how about S&P on each table so the waiters don't have to bring.  Believe it or not, they weren't on any table?? Geez, common sense is apparently in short supply here.  I love their food, but this place has gotten too popular for its own good. We sat down at 12:15 and went to pay with to-go boxes (we only had time to eat half the brunch) at 1:00!  We had a long wait in hot sun without so much as a courtesy glass of water, lousy service, and a rushed lunch despite having over 90 minutes and spending $26 + tip for breakfast for two! Yikes! They put a high priority on good food (tho I'm not so sure about the local now), but customer service and comfort are a distant 2nd and 3rd. So if this is NOT what u want, stay away from Lucky's before 1:00 on weekends since unfortunately, the owner is content to let the money come in and not address customer service. I find Grumpy's breakfast (also in Tremont) almost as good, cheaper, with much better service and normally a reasonable wait. Alternatively, eat breakfast at home and go to La Bodega for lunch -- in either case, you'll be more relaxed, just as well fed, and spend almost half as much time and money."}
{"text":"After visiting Cleveland for the first time, I would definitely proclaim that this little cozy establishment was the highlight of my trip!  I really have never been much of a brunch person, but Lucky's has converted me!  After digging into some of the homemade granola, I knew that I was in heaven.  It was light and fresh, the perfect way to start my morning.  They had great fresh squeezed OJ and the coffee was excellent.  I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Table of 7...no problem!!!  Food is from farm/garden to table. Our group ate grilled cheese with mushroom and tomato soup, pulled pork on homemade bread and the filling Mac n cheese. Drinks were a treat of coffee and homemade specials. 
My grandson got his favorite coffee milk with a super huge waffle. 
Wait staff were very good!"}
{"text":"Lovely little spot in Tremont for coffee and pastry! We really enjoyed our time here!
The mousse bomb is so delicious!"}
{"text":"Mmmm, biscuits and gravy goodness! Found this this place on road trippers.com/yelp but was a little scared of the yelp reviews regarding the service. Good thing I went anyways because our waitress and everyone else there were as sweet as could be. 

The portions are huge and the food was hot and fresh. A little on the expensive side but well worth it. Wish I lived here, cause is would go here every weekend and probably be 500 pounds. 
The smoothie was so pretty And tasty and the fresh fruit plate was not your average assortment, which was a nice surprise and it was so tasty!
Next time Im in town, I will defiantly make sure to stop by!"}
{"text":"Lucky's has been on my list of places to try for a LONG time, but it took a somewhat impulsive trip into Tremont on a beautiful Saturday morning to make it finally happen.  

We seem to have arrived just in time to get seated before the full press of the breakfast crowd, which was nice, since our growling innards would have certainly disturbed those around if we had to wait long to eat.

The menu presented a number of difficult choices - get the reuben or the shipwreck, the mac and cheese or the biscuits and gravy or... something else?  The clock was ticking and the smallish joint was rapidly filling before our eyes, this was no time for indecisiveness, so we placed our orders for a shipwreck and biscuits and gravy and started drooling as we watched the other orders come out to the tables around us. 

The food arrived in a reasonable mount of time and we got down to business.  Everything was delicious, and it certainly hit the spot after the too late night out preceding our visit.  Of special note was the Pecan bacon, which I would be happy to eat piles and piles of until my heart stopped.  

That being said, it wasn't a completely perfect experience.

One thing that was a little disconcerting was the apparent lack of a dedicated server for our table.  Maybe it's just a set up where everyone takes care of everyone, but the impression I got was that we were a little orphaned.  We did get attended to, but it seemed like we were seen being passed over, then taken care of.

A piece of parchment paper was cooked into one of our dishes.  The servers were very apologetic, and even explained at length how it could have/probably happened, but it would have been a nice gesture to offer to comp the meal.  I think most places would have done that, Lucky's did not. 

Lastly, Lucky's reputation from reviews, TV, and trusted friends all indicated that the food would be excellent, and it was.  The philosophy of growing and locally sourcing ingredients is respectable and appreciated.  Even taking that into consideration it seemed a little pricey for breakfast food.  I'm not saying it needs to be diner cheap, but I wonder if maybe there's a middle ground where it would feel a little less steep despite the quality. 

Given the opportunity, I'll likely go back to Lucky's. If so, I'd be interested to see if these first impressions are valid."}
{"text":"This is my normal Saturday brunch spot since I moved to Cleveland two years ago! The food is really good and they do the whole local farm fresh thing right. The one thing that really sucks is they won't do any \"custom\" orders on their food (like if you don't want mushrooms or something in your omelette). The pecan bacon is the most delicious bacon I've ever had (they only serve it during weekends). Their portions are pretty big so even though it's a bit on the pricey side it's not that big of a deal. Don't worry about saving room for desert though as they're usually not that great."}
{"text":"Food is good but not worth the long wait so if you go here especially for weekend brunch go early! The restaurant is small and not too many tables hence the long wait. I prefer egg white substitutes for my omelettes and this is not a option at luckys so that was a downside for me."}
{"text":"I love Luckys. Great food, but a little pricy and always a wait. Be warned that if you're Gluten free you cannot eat the pecan bacon."}
{"text":"Farm to table breakfast is really nice. The waffle was TO DIE. my husband got the biscuits in gravy and we split the veg omelet. The wait was crazy so I ordered us lattes while we waited which took 15 just for the lattes to be made. It seems like a popular spot but the barista is pretty overwhelmed. We sat outside on some nice picnic tables. It was a nice morning."}
{"text":"The only thing I can add about this wonderful place that has not already been said:

Get the pecan crusted bacon.

Seriously.  I know it's expensive. Just do it.  You will not be sorry."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE customer service.
Was told I had ONE option because I have a dairy allergy.
(The eggs had dairy in them....)
Overpriced. 

After hearing so much praise for Lucky's, I decided to walk down the street and try it out.
We walked in to find no line, and a couple open tables near the front. 
As we approached the hostess stand I glanced at the barista/cashier, made eye contact, then she looked away with out greeting us. We stood at the hostess stand for 10 minutes before one of the servers greeted us. By this time there were a couple families waiting in line behind us.
After being seated we ordered drinks and food from a waitress
who looked as if we were bothering her.
I asked for no cheese on one of the scrambles. She
asked if it was because of a dairy allergy, I said yes.
She said there were dairy in all the eggs so I was only
able to order the Tofu Scramble. By this time I was so hungry I just said sure.
The food came out bland and my friend had to wait 10 minutes and to ask twice to get some hot sauce.
A girl at another table asked for coffee multiple times but ended up going to the barista herself.
Then, no one mentioned we had to pay at the counter. So we sat at the table looking like morons for while. Then watched someone else go pay at the counter.
Cashier was rude. 

NEVER going back."}
{"text":"The yummy food just couldn't make up for the worst service I've had in a very long time. I was with a party of 3 on a Sunday for brunch- the place was very busy but tables turned over pretty quickly and we were seated in 20 minutes. The waitress gave us a death stare when someone dropped their fork and needed a fresh one. A different waitress brought coffee, and it took 8 minutes and 2 requests before the cream and sugar were eventually brought over. No drinks were refilled at any point. The creme brûlée oatmeal was extravagantly delicious, but the servers' terrible attitudes soured the whole experience and I won't go back."}
{"text":"I have been to Lucky's a couple of times. It is always a ruckus when you walk in. Very close quarters with people paying at the counter and people entering. I think the place is alright. The food is good here. Not good enough to be spending dinner entree prices for a breakfast though. I would rather just grab a piece of bread, spread peanut butter on it and be full for a few hours for the price of 50 cents, but some people like making a big production out of breakfast on the weekends so I go here with them. This is a nice place to eat, the service is ok, somewhat elitist with high prices. I would rather pay $5 for a cheap breakfast with crazy eggs that came out of a crazy mutant chicken and have the extra money to spend on other things."}
{"text":"We were visiting the A Christmas Story House and decided to check out this nearby DDD place for lunch before leaving town. Parking is on the street, so be ready to walk at least a little bit. It was clean and had nice decor inside, and the staff was very friendly. 

My fiance got the biscuits and gravy with a root beer (old fashioned in the glass bottle), and I had the baked mac and cheese with an iced coffee. My mac and cheese was good - not great - and came with a dozen or so red grapes and a very small serving of pretty bland homemade applesauce. The iced coffee was very good, especially if you like strong coffee with a fair amount of acidity. My fiance was disappointed with his biscuits and gravy. While it was decent, the scallions on top essentially just overpowered everything else. His came with fewer grapes and some potatoes. He did not care for the root beer at all.

I thought we'd like this place based on its current reviews. I wanted to love this place because of its hip vibe and welcoming atmosphere. We did not love it because we thought the portions and quality did not align with the cost."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch. I had the the grilled cheese with butternut squash soup.  Soup was really good but the grilled cheese was greasy.  My friend got the mac and cheese. I tried some...good but very salty.   Food is supposed to be all homemade so i was expecting something a little more healthy tasting. A touch on the pricy side too."}
{"text":"I am so sad to write this review. I live in the neighborhood and had been on a scone eating rampage the last several months. In the last two weeks my husband and have gotten scones from Luckys on three separate occasions and they have been horrible! Horrible!!! It is very clear to me that they have been frozen and then thawed. They were soggy in places and dry in others. The texture was disgusting. I had been on a roll eating their scones almost everyday for several weeks a few months ago. Something happened. It's ridiculous to get such substandard pasty. I am not pleased."}
{"text":"It was our first time here & we really didn't know what to expect. A $70 breakfast for 4 people seemed a little steep especially considering we didn't even have any meat. 

The waffles got a little dry and I wanted syrup, well I could only get more syrup if I wanted to spend $4 on it. Crazyyyy!

Food was good but I don't plan on coming here often. It's pricey."}
{"text":"This place gets an A+. 

Went to Lucky's on a Saturday at 11am, there was no wait. Got to get seated outdoors. Had wonderful food - most of it homegrown. The reuben sandwich is great. The service was great - very courteous waiters, and I like that you don't have to wait for your check, you just take your table number to the front.

Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Okay, ignoring the hipster culture surrounding this place and all of the Hipster vibes, I have to admit this place is brilliant. This place has three major things going for it: fresh, locally sourced ingredients, creative menus, and location. This is not your everyday breakfast joint; they are pricey, but definitely worth it. 

The first thing that graced my lips was Lucky's Latte. It was nothing like the syrup-filled cups of steamed milk I was used to from Starbucks or Caribou. I could taste the freshness, and this heavenly concoction came with a strong coffee flavor and the subtle hint of honey. I also had the gingerbread waffles and scarfed the whole portion down in a matter of minutes. My SO ordered the shipwreck and it was so large it was seeping over the sides of the plate. Everything exceeded my expectations.

Lucky's is the special occasion place of brunch, but without the booze. If you're craving a fresh and hearty breakfast or lunch, this place is a gold mine."}
{"text":"I stopped here on a Wednesday morning for breakfast. It was a very comfy environment. The food was amazing. Everything fresh and tasty.. The service was fast but not rushed. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I like to think of myself as a Mac n cheese connoisseur as 9 out of 10 times if it's offered on a menu that is what I get..so I've eaten a lot of Mac and cheese. Of course I had to get it here as just the description made me drool with excitement and HOLY CRAP. Best Mac n cheese I have ever had hands down. No competition to anyone else. The perfect creamy blend of cheese and crunchy bread crumbs on top is to die for. I also had a refreshing Thai Iced Tea and the applesauce was fresh and delicious. While the prices are a bit steep for my post college grad budget they are a great business to support and worth every penny!"}
{"text":"A simple google of 'best brunch in Cleveland' led me to this place on my quick weekend adventure. It has a cool/strange location on a very residential street, and it's much smaller than I expected. I called ahead and the employee kindly informed me that I could put my name down for a table 15 minutes in advance when one is on their way to the cafe; this worked out perfectly and we were sat promptly even at peak hours (Sunday at noon).

The cafe is very clean and just the right balance of modern but home-y. The small menu made it easy for everyone to pick their brunch choice, and we were 4/4 for loving our choices: The Biscuits, Mac n' Cheese, Oatmeal Waffles (special), and Shipwreck (essentially a breakfast scramble). The house mochas were also fantastic. The prices ($13ish) are about what you'd expect for a place of this quality; the presentation of every dish was great. I'd definitely return next time I'm in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and overall atmosphere!  Wish I had a chance to try to try more things, but next time I be a bit more adventurous about my menu choices!"}
{"text":"Unfortunate experience! Certainly not worth the 45 minute wait and mediocre service. Nothing worse than a pretentious attitude, waiters that don't bathe, not paying attention to details, not having an option for children and feeling like it was a privilege to be their customer. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Would have preferred 3.5 stars if possible, but bumped it to 4 for some of the uniqueness of my gf's dish.

Like many have said: the place is TINY. Any more than 2 people together and you'll have a harder time getting seated...though we saw planet of groups 4+. The tables are all very close together and you're squished in. I think this was an old house renovated. It'd be great if they could expand in the future as there's always customers to fill those extra seats and a little more room would be nice.

Food: I got the shipwreck. At the time, I thought it was crazy delicious. Looking back now, I think it wasn't that spectacular - think I was mainly just hungry for the drive up from Columbus that morning. Also asked for hot sauce to use on the side. Now that was awesome, definitely get some to use. It's got a great kick and flavor to it (it's house made). My gf got a special: pumpkin brioche French toast. You could really really taste the pumpkin filling and it was really cool and unique. Between the two of us, we really should have only gotten one entree, as we had to kind of force our way to finish everything (French toast woulda been no good as leftover and we were out exploring Cleveland all day). I guess it justifies the price, as these plates were pretty expensive. I think the bill came out to around $40 for two plates and two coffees. Each plate is 1.5 persons worth. 


Parking is pretty easy actually as there's plenty of street parking on the same street."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I first heard of this place on \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives\" and immediately knew I had to find out how amazing it was for myself.  Although the prices are on the high side, our breakfast was amazing!  I had the biscuits and gravy, which were the most delicious biscuits and gravy I've ever had in my life!  My mom had the waffle which literally tasted like dessert!  I also had a delicious mocha that didn't even last until my breakfast arrived! I will most definitely be going back to Lucky's if I'm ever in Cleveland again!"}
{"text":"This little gem is tuck away on a side street and boy I'm glad I found it! The little space is quite comfortable and inviting. They have a small menu but everything on it sounds incredible. I elected to go with the biscuits and gravy and I was not disappointed. I know a thing or two about biscuits and gravy coming from the South and I was a little leery getting them up North. I have to to say that Lucky's did not disappoint. The flavor was much different than the southern style but in a good way. The gravy had an excellent texture and the hint of rosemary pushed it over the edge. The home fries were also seasoned and cooked well. Overall, I was very pleased with the Northern spin on a Southern classic. Will definitely come back for more!"}
{"text":"My friends and I weren't too lucky at Lucky's Cafe... We had to wait for our food for over an hour.  Our waiter took our drink order and then never came back to ask what we wanted for brunch... He actually forgot about our table completely...We saw other tables eat their food and leave even though they arrived after we did.  The chef did come out and apologize and after some complaining....we received scones on the house and a dessert.  When the food finally arrived - omelette, shipwreck dish, biscuits and mac & cheese... I wasn't too impressed.  Maybe it was the wait that make everything else bad."}
{"text":"Review is for the brunch. I've gone to Lucky's twice for brunch and both times it was very pleasant. It's busy, but the wait was only about 20 minutes both times. Took a walk around the block and then sat on the bench out front. We sat outside in nice weather, which was great. I had the shipwreck, with  tons of eggs and veggies and really enjoyed it. Waitress was attentive and got our food in a good amount of time. It was busy, but didn't feel pressured to leave all the time. I'd recommend it to anyone in the area on a Saturday or Sunday morning."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!! I visited with my fiancé on our vacation in Cleveland and it was amazing!  We heard about the place from diners drive ins and dives and it was better than we imagined. The place is adorable inside, very clean and quaint feeling. The food was great. You could tell the use fresh ingredients in their meals. I had the grilled cheese special with tomato soup and now that I'm writing this, I wish I could go have another. The staff is also extremely nice and seem very knowledgeable about the food. It's a little off the beaten path but I would definitely recommend visiting!"}
{"text":"A little pricy, but it's a wonderful atmosphere, especially when it's nice enough outside! The mac 'n cheese is my favorite, but there are other great options. There are also plenty of coffee options."}
{"text":"Lucky's has good food, but their service is the worst in Cleveland. I've been there many times, and I've always complained about their service, but today's was so bad it inspired a review  At one point today I actually watched for one server to smile, and it never happened!! In fact, think \"sourpuss\" while there, it fits perfectly! I'm all about good food, but for me dining is about the whole experience. I don't care how good the food is... I won't be back if the staff is unkind, unaccommodating, and rude!!"}
{"text":"Wow! Possibly the best brunch meal we've ever had. From start to finish, amazing service, tasty food. Very reasonable for the excellent quality ingredients. 

BEST biscuits and gravy EVER. Perfectly seasoned and complex flavor. 

And.... Coffee was top notch. A must in my book. 

Our server Sunshine, was super friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Got a half order of waffles and the burrito, my sister got a half order of waffles and an omelette.  2 coffees.  Total $51.  For growing their own food and using local farmers, it sure seemed way over priced.  Waffles were excellent, not worth $13, but still good.  The burrito and omelette were just okay, nothing special.  My sister (a vegetarian) asked for no bacon, but was quickly told no substitutions, so keep that in mind if you plan on going."}
{"text":"Super yummy brunch spot in Cleveland! They try to use all local ingredients and make everything in house. My friend and I shared the \"Shipwreck\" and the mac and cheese. We both loved the meals! The wait for a table was well worth it. 

Also, our server was awesome. His name was Ed and he gave us information on the restaurant, our food, and treated us great. 

Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Farm to table explains the higher prices. Small quaint room with a large patio had a good feel. I had the lamb burger on flat bread. Came with a spinach goat cheese mixture on the patty. Interesting. Messy. Lamb had a mild taste. I like a stronger flavor. $13.50. Ice coffee was very good $2.75. Fancier cold and hot coffees cost up to $4.50. Girl friend had a scrambled egg veggie dish called Shipwreck. Large portion. Very good. Took half home. Looking forward to trying other dishes. Try out Lucky's, and visit the shops and galleries in Tremont."}
{"text":"I can't believe I just paid $50 for the worst breakfasts we've ever had. 2 stars for an attempt at a farm to table restaurant... that only serves egg beaters (note, this is my opinion. I haven't been in their kitchen to see egg beaters. However, I politely asked for over easy eggs and was told they could not do that, the eggs were already made, and it was scrambled eggs only... Which would lead one to believe they must not have eggs in the back if I'm not allowed to order them)."}
{"text":"I am a very big fan of this place.  While I have only been there twice, the food and service are really terrific.  How they get the perfect golden crust on their toasted sandwiches is beyond me, but I LOVE it :)  Every time I am in Cleveland I will seek an opportunity to eat here.  Thank you Lucky's!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick cup of coffee on my whirlwind tour of Cleveland. Got a vanilla latte and was quite pleased with it - strong espresso and the right amount of vanilla sweetness and foam. Good, but not the best ever and if I recall correctly, the price was more in line with DC than Cleveland. 

Saw that the Diners Drive-ins and Dives dude visited the place. Honestly, it kind of turned me off to what would otherwise be a really cute, really busy neighborhood place. 

I would definitely go back to sample their food selections but I'm always wary of Guy Fieri special. He is, afterall, pitching TGI Fridays. But hey, to each his own."}
{"text":"SO GOOD.
We got the biscuits and gravy as well as the maple bacon. This is my new go to breakfast spot! Everything is so fresh and delicious, you almost feel no guilt! There is typically a wait but it is well worth it! Trust!"}
{"text":"There I was, standing in line for Lucky's on an early Saturday morning.  

This place is always packed and there is always a wait.  I can't really complain though, because it's worth it.  

Everything was delicious (the Shipwreck and the Buscuits), the staff was prompt and the apple cider was quite the deal!  I hope to come back with a book just to get a scone and another cider as that seems to be quite the deal.

As I was leaving someone had stopped a waiter to tell them they'd googled \"Diners Dives and Drive-Ins\" and came up with Luckys.  There you go, that explains the wait.  

So, so long as you have some time to spare in the morning, check it out.  It's worth the wait."}
{"text":"The waffles. Get the waffles. Heaven! Even by themselves, without all of the decadent toppings, they're delicious....but the homemade whipped cream is perfection. Loved every bite :)"}
{"text":"Great spot for some yummy breakfast or brunch!

We came on a Wednesday morning so luckily there was no wait. 

If you're into locally sourced and organic food this is definitely your spot! We ordered a variety of things and everything was super good. The shipwreck was bomb - I was able to order it without the bacon. Honestly, the portion was so big, it would have been enough for two people to share. I think it came with for slices of toast or so. They had homemade raspberry-strawberry jam which was OMG so damn good. Probably the best jam I have ever had in my entire life. But as far as I know the types of jam they have rotate.
Our table also had the grilled cheese - which looked absolutely amazing, waffles and biscuits and gravy. Everything was definitely 100% legit and recommended. 

I like to call myself a coffee snob but would give Lucky's the thumbs up. The latte's dairy and non dairy were on point. 

There's really not much to complain about besides a few minor things. Lucky's is pretty pricy. As a family of 5 (one is a child under 2) we spend almost $90 on breakfast. Additionally, there is no kids menu/meal available so I'd say this place isn't really family friendly if you ask me. 
Also, parking stinks, we went on a non busy day and had trouble finding parking in close proximity. 

Other than that, I'd recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"LOCAL!

This was the big hit during my most recent trip to Cle. I heard so much about the breakfast that we made sure to set our alarms to beat the crowd. Sure enough, we were early birds and even scored a front parking spot! The morning sun shined through the windows, coffee and fresh pastry filled the air and as we sat down, I spotted the beautiful vegetable garden. Lush, overgrown and plenty - anyone was able to tour through and chat with the owners. 

We enjoyed several different dishes including the corned beef hash, biscuits and gravy and the kitchen sink style scramble. As for my favorite, it was the corned beef hash, hands down. The poached eggs were perfect, and crowned the top of the meat and potatoes so gently. As the yolk broke over, it completed the dish and married all the flavors together. I was absolute heaven. The other side dish we ordered was the pecan crusted bacon. Are you freaking kidding me? This was a dream come true on top on being in heaven. I bit into a piece and wanted to die, it tasted that good. After all that savory, it was so nice to have the sweet crust of the salty bacon to bite into other than fruit. What a treat!

Get that bacon. Now."}
{"text":"I hate to be a Debbie, but I'm unimpressed by Lucky's.  I love the concept and the aesthetic of Lucky's -- chic bohemian organic sustainable  goodness but not too crunchy -- but the food is just so so.  I really WANT to love Lucky's, because Cleveland really doesn't have a place like Lucky's, especially coming from the East Side where brunch options are limited to IHOP, The Inn on Coventry, First Watch, fire, and Tommy's.  (Oh Tommy's, how you vex me so, but I\"m saving that for another review).  Anyway, because it's kind of the only show in town, it's always super crowded on the weekends.  I usually stand in line for at least 10 min to order at the counter and then scrounge around for a table and when I'm either hungover or hungry, it just feels like too much work for breakfast.  

I will say that they have great coffee, fresh juices, and delicious pastries.  It's the warm entrees that I find so disappointing.  Tried the Shipwreck, Canoewreck, and the breakfast burrito and they just seemed to be kind of bland.  

Overall, I love the look and feel of Lucky's but the food is just so so."}
{"text":"Anytime a restaurant is featured on the Food Network, it's at least worth a try in my book.  And after having eaten there, I'll agree with the other reviewers that it certainly lives up to the hype.

I went with my family for Christmas Eve brunch and surprisingly didn't have to wait very long for a table.  The waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu--a definite plus since there are so many good things on it.

Since the restaurant uses locally-sourced ingredients, Lucky's has a tendency to run out of certain dishes.  But fortunately the Reuben was still available!  The sandwich was excellent and by far the best part of it was the corned beef, which was much more flavorful by itself than any I'd had before.  The thousand island dressing was also rich, creamy, and delicious (and I appreciated that it came on the side so I could be the judge of how much was \"just right\").  The potato salad that came with the sandwich was good but not great.  It had a much higher potato-to-mayo ratio than most potato salads I've eaten, and the chunks of potato were much larger--a plus in my book.  But I still didn't find it to have a particularly unique flavor.

The other dish I tried--the mac-n-cheese--was to die for (and probably clogs your arteries as you eat it!).  It's so rich an creamy with several different kinds of cheeses, plus extra cream.  The brie gives it a little more \"grown up\" flavor, just going to show that you're never too old to eat mac 'n' cheese.  We didn't order it with the bacon--that would've been a little much--but it probably wouldn't hurt to add it!

For dessert, any of the cookies, pastries, or cakes are good.  My personal favorites are the biscotti and rugelach, but of which come in several varieties.  And since they're on the small side, you can get a few and see for yourself which ones you like best.  You won't be disappointed (with this or any of the other food at Lucky's)!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice. It is always talked about in reviews of the \"best\" breakfast places in Cleveland. I personally thought the food was not very good. They do have good coffee drinks. Lucky's is the kind of place that tries so hard to be so good and it fails to be satisfying. Not to mention the place is very overpriced. This neighborhood has tons of good breakfast spots and I really wanted to give this place another chance to impress me but it just isn't good. I've tried the breakfast burrito and I've tried an omelette. Maybe I haven't tried the right thing yet I don't know."}
{"text":"If you wake up to be welcomed by a hearty warm breakfast, it's likely that you'd have a happy day. And a happy state makes a healthier human. Lucky's Café delivered a fantastic brunch on 7/8/2017. 

I'm not a fan of omelets because they're rarely delicious for me. Think of a good breakfast, I think of freshly squeezed OJ, hot dark roast coffee, eggs, but with lots of carbs like pancakes, waffles, French toast, bread, etc. One of my best legit foodie friends brought me here. I thankfully went with the omelet option and he picked the rhubarb waffles.  The latter were tasty but waffles were soggy.  The omelet had white cheddar, zucchini, mushrooms and spinach. Served with scrumptious hash browns and a glorious wedge of banana bread. All were $14. I think it was one of the best omelets I have ever had!. This was the first time I didn't need to add salt or pepper or sauces or ketchup or anything. I can tell the eggs and cheddar cheese were top-notch quality. They were seasoned and cooked to perfection. We sat outside by the garden. They're growing tomatoes. They say this place is farmers to table style. I can concur, based on the freshness and perfect flavors we had. They serve water in stainless steel cups which is the smartest way to serve cold water in the summer. The water though, tasted weird like a freezer smell.  They don't have freshly squeezed OJ here. It took no time for the food to be served. Waitresses were loud.

If you're in Cleveland Ohio area, I think you'll enjoy a wonderful breakfast at Lucky's. Get the omelet."}
{"text":"Lucky's has by far the BEST macaroni and cheese on the planet - for which I am giving this restaurant the 5 star rating. I live in Chicago and as opportunity allows, I go to this restaurant to get my fix. The homemade Ruben sandwich is outstanding too. I can't say I haven't tried much else on the menu because I've found my crush.  

I love the ambiance. I remember when most coffee shops were like this. Parking is found on the street and pretty easy. Prices are reasonable, especially considering the owner is very conscious of local, sustainable, homemade food. Because of the food's awsomeness you can expect a wait."}
{"text":"This is the only place that I have found that has really great lattes, more specifically, Lucky's Latte! Also, if you're a Mac fan, you'll die over their Baked Mac N Cheese."}
{"text":"I stop in at Lucky's pretty often and the food has always been good which is why I go back. I also like supporting local businesses and most of the staff is pretty friendly. 
My sister and I went in on a crowded Saturday and we had my nephew in the stroller. One of the guys came to the door to help with the stroller and offered to store it upstairs while we ate. 
The only negative comment I have concerns my takeout experience. On two different occasions I have ordered the soup of the day, but when I got to work there was something different than what I ordered. This last time I ordered the corn chowder, but ended up with a mushroom soup. They should tell customers if they are out of something and notify them of any changes."}
{"text":"Ohmygosh. How have I taken so long to come to this place for brunch? Came with the hubs on a Saturday AM. 
We walked in and it looked packed but they were able to seat us right away and they server was very friendly. 
Then I looked at the menu... um, can I have one of each? Holy moly! I couldn't choose! After much waffling over the menu choices we decided to get the waffles and the corned beef hash. OK, who came up with gingerbread waffles? Genius. So good. Fresh whipped cream? Yes, please! The gingerbread was not overwhelming but just a nice flavor. 
The corned beef hash was just as good. The server said something about it being a two week process... I don't know what that means, but it works. The hash was seasoned perfectly. I got the hollandaise sauce on the side and it was just rich enough to dip a few bites in. The eggs that came with the dish were poached to perfection. As I left there I promised myself that I was going to learn to poach an egg. (I still can' get them that good). 
The place was just a bit pricey, but for all that farm to table goodness, I kinda get it. 
As far as the issues other diners mentioned about the substitutions and poor wait staff, we didn't experience any of that, so we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how I've never been here before. Now that I have, I'm not sure how I am managing to not go 7 days/week. 

Everything is fresh. Everything. Did I mention - everything. They even make their own bread. I had this potato/egg/vegetable thing with this toast...#omgthetoast. They call it \"Como-Toast\" because it's THAT good. 

The boy got waffles with strawberry rhubarb. It reminded me of the rhubarb pie my mom used to make. It was so good. with homemade whipped cream. 

We also had some hazelnut mocha iced coffee. Umm... this place could survive as JUST a coffee shop and be successful. Consider it an added bonus that they also have food. 

5-star. Amazing."}
{"text":"During a recent trip to Cleveland, I knew one of my must-sees was Lucky's Cafe.  I must have been lucky as there was no wait and my server was great.  Ordered the Shipwreck with a side of sawmill gravy.  Wow, great execution of fresh ingredients.  It was too much to eat at one sitting, I had to take some as leftovers for the next day.  There was a few other dishes I wouldn't mind trying the next time I make it to Cleveland.  Total with an iced tea was under $20.  Not cheap, but not unreasonable either.  Someplace to repeat and recommend!"}
{"text":"Heather (owner, chef) and her staff were very accommodating to our party of 5, we had the best food and the best service, I can't thank her enough! We decided we would order all the different items on the brunch menu so we could try everything and it was worth it. My husband literally told her it was the best food he's ever eaten (this makes a chef very happy). Thanks to my cousin and his wife I've now eaten brunch here twice and loved it both times. I can't complain about the prices since I didn't pay for my meal but I can see that it's not exactly affordable to eat there often so it's a good thing that I live out of state and only get treated to this when I visit."}
{"text":"I visited there earlier in the month, and it was a good first time experience in the Tremont area! The menu was limited but had really good selection! What's amazing is that they use local produce and vegetables that are grown in the garden behind the cafe! Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Pros: server was great, food was good, nice atmosphere. 

Cons: very rude barista, bad coffee and food overpriced

This was my first time at Lucky's and I won't be returning. Upon arriving we decided to have a couple coffees while we waited for our table, this is the rude conversation I had with the female blonde elderly barista:

\"What's a papa mocha?\" I asked
\"It's the same as a mama mocha but with more fat\" she annoyed-ly answered 
\"Ok, then what's mama mocha?\" I asked further
\"Are you asking me what's a mocha?! It's cooofffeeee.....chooooccooolaaaate....\" She responded like I'm an idiot. 
\"I know what a traditional mocha is\" I said
\"I'm asking you if there's something that makes a Mama mocha different than a regular mocha\" I asked again. 
\"It's a papa mocha with less fat\". She responded to my shock
\"I'll have a medium coffee please. \" I surrendered. 
    She continued being rude, this time about me giving her my name instead of cash to pay for the coffee.  This was my first time. How was I supposed to know that she started a tab for me!? I was just trying to pay for my coffees.

Then we sat and ate. Host was nice. Coffee was terrible. Like that vacuum packed brick of coffee you buy from the corner store when you're really broke, bad. So on our out way out we complained to the rude barista about the coffee:

\"I just wanted to tell you I really didn't care for the coffee.\" I said
\"Well that's the first complaint I've ever had about the coffee in 18 years\" she said
\"Well, still, it's really quite awful, sorry. Do you know the brand of coffee you use or where the beans come from?\" I asked
She didn't answer me because she had no idea. Another barista said Caruso's in Brecksville. She made sure to tell me they roast it there.
   Anyone who knows anything about coffee knows that it doesn't matter Where it's roasted. And any barista worth half a cent, who cares even the slightest about coffee knows where the coffee is from. For the record Caruso's coffee is a business that buys the lowest grade coffee they can and they  roast it on site so that even though you're serving coffee that tastes like tar, you can shout from your rooftop, \"It's Locally roasted!\""}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Saturday morning very hungry and excited, based on all the other Yelp reviews. I got the macaroni and cheese which turned out to be heavenly and my friend got the omelette which had the right amount of veggies and was quite filling. Both meals with one drink each and the bill came to around $45, a bit pricey for breakfast, but still a very tasty and well prepared meal."}
{"text":"OK- I know... everyone LOVES lucky's. But, I finally tried it this morning, and I just was NOT impressed... :-\ Don't get me wrong, it's a SUPER cute place, with a YUMMMMMY dessert case full of mouth watering, calorie packed, pieces of goodness (at least they LOOKED that way). But anyways, a friend of mine and her baby went to lucky's for some food today after hearing good things. There were a few tables filled when we got there, nothing too crazy, but yet no one came to greet us and seat us or tell us they'd be with us. A few customers who were paying (and playing with the baby) were kind enough to tell us that they will come by eventually to seat us. We were finally seated, and our waitress explained the concept to us, really cute- they use all locally grown ingredients, which is amazing.

Not so amazing? the fact that their menu is SUPER limited- so much so that I asked if bacon could be removed from the shipwreck and was told I couldn't... Ok, that's fine I get it, things are premixed. Then, I asked if I could ADD eggs and cheese to the canoe wreck. I may be a veg, but I love my cheese and was wanting eggs. And, I was told I couldn't.... which I didn't understand at all - you can't charge me extra and add eggs and cheese? But, ok... I said I'd find something else. Except nothing else really jumped out at me. They didn't have a \"a la carte\" menu, but finally my friend suggested to see if they could do eggs on the side. So when the waitress stopped by again, I asked and she said yes......... so where was that suggestion when we were originally ordering? My friend got the biscuits and gravy. We were going to get the baby some fruit but the waitress said the fruit that came with the meals were apples because that's all they had. 

I was not all too impressed with the canoe wreck. The potatoes were ok, a bit dry... The veggies were good, but I guess I just wasn't too thrilled about curried tofu - and the taste of it pretty much was all over the dish. The side of eggs with cheese were pretty good tho..... The como-toast was pretty good - tho it was kind of burnt... Also, I found some pineapple under my apple slices and an orange! so much for apple being their only fruit...?? So, the baby got some pineapple since it was soft enough for him :) :) My friend thought the biscuits and gravy were decent. But, neither of us really thought ~$15+ dollars per dish was worth it for what we ate...

The coffee was strong and tasted delicious. I'm sure the desserts would have been great too. 

I REALLY wanted to like Lucky's. It was something I had been wanting to try since moving here over a year ago! The overall service was not something to write home about for sure... So that on top of the lack of choices on the menu on top of the fact that I was not too impressed by my food will probably be enough to keep me from trying Lucky's again... I'll probably stick to my usual favorite brunch places."}
{"text":"Brunch is excellent. Atmosphere is great. Service is always pleasant and fast.  Can get crowded but worth it. Ding ding Tremont wins on a unanimous decision."}
{"text":"Lunch time service is virtually non existant, which is quite annoying when u just drove 10 hours, tired, and hungry.  The only reason i didnt give them a 1 star is cuz the food is decent."}
{"text":"I usually don't write any reviews but I had to write one for this place. I'm new to the city and went there one Saturday morning all by myself. I felt like home. Best hospitality and most wonderful staff. And the food is even better. If you're having a bad day, just visit Lucky's. I guarantee you'll feel better."}
{"text":"Not from the area, stopped in with family for a quick lunch. Everyone loved their food, and the iced moca was the best I've ever had. The waitress who served us was extremely nice. Would go here again."}
