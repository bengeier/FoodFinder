{"text":"LOVE this place!! The beef and veggies is amazing and so is their lo mein! Very clean, and the service is fast!"}
{"text":"I recommend for take out. Crab rangoon was excellent, sesame chicken was great, moo shu chicken was tasty, but the pancakes were a bit dry. I wasn't a big fan of the shezuan beef. Dining in is fine, but you order at the counter (no server) & your food comes on a Styrofoam plate. So far, the best Chinese I've had in the area, but I haven't tried many here yet."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, very affordable, lots of variety.  I especially like their egg rolls (hard to find good ones in C-U.)  Bo will remember you after a couple of times, too.  He can even remember if you don't like green peppers, usually order the orange chicken, etc.  Hidden in a little strip mall by Culver's, I think it is one of Champaign's hidden secrets."}
{"text":"Another review from a few years back, really sorry, but wanted to make note of the places I loved when we lived in Champaign.  We used to live in the apartments right down the street from this place so we used to order from them by default.  That being said I was pleasantly surprised at how clean and nice this little place was.  They cooked everything fresh when I ordered and the flavors were good.  They were nice and were willing to mess with the dishes a little to accommodate some dietary things.  This place was a solid choice for take out whenever I craved Chinese."}
{"text":"They changed ownership and with that the quality of food went down. It's not bad, just not amazing like it use to be. I now prefer to go to Golden Harbor for my Take Out Chinese food."}
{"text":"Terrible! Tried this place because I was referred by a friend. Ordered my food on my lunch break just to take it back to work to eat and I find I live black beatle-like bug crawling through my rice. Will never go back to this place again and would not recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese food we've had since leaving NYC 4 years ago and living in many cities since.  It's amazingly delicious and fresh.  Don't be fooled by the appearance, it looks like a place you would want to walk right by, but because other Yelp users said it was so good, we decided to ignore the appearance and went it.  We are so very glad we did.  It's amazing.  We had the dumplings, sesame chicken and the orange chicken.  Everything we had was outstanding.  We will be back often."}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food, fast, and friendly staff.  The food at most other places in town doesn't measure up.  This a diner atmosphere, which is typical for most Chinese food places, so it's not a date night dining option."}
{"text":"Recently stopped in for lunch.  Had the General's chicken with the chicken wings.  At least something different from the usual lunch specials with the egg roll.   The food was fine, but nothing to make me go back.  My friend had the sweet & sour pork & wasn't too pleased with the pork.  The people were very friendly though."}
{"text":"Been coming here for almost 3 years now. Consistent great food, best sesame seed chicken in the city hands down. Only negative is they are closed on Sunday."}
{"text":"I noticed while ordering that a cook was mixing noodles with his bare hands.  Sanitation not on Best Woks menu."}
{"text":"Neck-and-neck for my favorite Chinese in town.  Fast and fresh and  very reasonably priced.  I've paid twice as much for general chicken elsewhere, but it's not as good as at Best Wok.  Great egg rolls, too."}
{"text":"You would never know it by the outside (or especially the inside) but this is amazing Chinese food! I have been to this place countless times over the years and it is always consistently awesome.  The sesame chicken, chicken and broccoli, cashew chicken and chow mein are all great, as are their egg rolls.  Great food at a very good (read: cheap!) price."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this out today, and I left pretty impressed. Got the double sauteed pork lunch special with chicken wings and lo mein. Even with a $1.50 upcharge for the lo mein, it still only came to $8.39, AND that included a drink.  I seemed to get there at the very beginning of the lunch crowd, as it was empty when I arrived, but by the time I left, it was nearly full. Food came out really fast, and I wasn't surprised, because when I walked in, I could see back into the kitchen, and it was very well-staffed.  The chicken wings and the pork were great, but my favorite part was the lo mein. It's kinda how I judge Chinese places, as a lot of them have greasy lo mein, or lo mein that is just flavorless. But not here. They were perfectly cooked, and super garlic-y (which is a major plus for my tastes).  I can see why so many people are fond of Best Wok, and it's on the top tier of Chinese places in Charlotte for me."}
{"text":"So much better than Panda Express. Better taste, quantity and larger variety. Huge selection and fast service. My son, who gets orange chicken every chance he gets--said he's never had better. Plenty of room to eat in, or easy to take home. My only complaint was the lack of desert selections. I like a little something sweet after Chinese food! Besides the fortune cookie."}
{"text":"New to the area, checked out the reviews decided to \"try\" it out and it was delicious! Love their combination SPECIALS and the prices are good! Fast service and quality food...close to home and that's ALWAYS a plus"}
{"text":"We've taken out from this location a few times. Once I found a hair in my lo mein and vowed never again. Some time passed and figured I'd try again. Giving them the benefit of the doubt .The food has been relatively good, definitely have had much better however this time my wife got food poisening. So needless to say, we will not be getting anything from there again. Not worth it."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch after reading the reviews. I ordered to dine in and they took my order quickly. The sanitation score was 96.5 so that was a good sign. The food was brought to me buy a server (somehow she remembered who I was) and I dug in. The chicken was tasty with a nice crunchy texture. Some people don't like it like that and prefer it more tender. The rice and broccoli were tasty too. I asked for spicy but it wasn't that spicy. The wings were delicious. I will be back. Nice people running the place."}
{"text":"My food, no matter how much I get, only takes 10 minutes. Amazing staff, amazing food, great prices.  I love the general chicken, or sesame. The soups are awesome, and watch out for the garlic and broccoli sauce: spicy, man!"}
{"text":"Highly disappointing considering how much the food costs. The food is mediocre and has no taste. I ordered three different dishes (beef, chicken, tofu) and each pretty much tasted the same. Bland. The portions are small. They give you a lot of rice but little meat. Very shady practice. I would never eat here even if it were free."}
{"text":"I have a rule when it comes to fast food Chinese...if they can't make sweet n sour shrimp right, I can't eat there. My first time I ordered the sweet n sour shrimp here and after I picked it up and brought it home I took a bite, and the batter was still raw on the inside. It was inedible. The 2 stars is for the chow mien noodles which were average and nothing special. Customer service was poor as they gave attitude when we asked for extra sweet n sour packets. I'd rather try other fast food Chinese places than order from here again."}
{"text":"Favorite Chinese Food in Chambana. Food is cooked in front of you and it's always good."}
{"text":"The best Chinese in Charlotte PERIOD!!! The sesame chicken is one of the best I've ever had! Service is good and prices very fair! Everything is good and has a unique flavor. Not like most Chinese restaurants that all taste the same. This place puts its own spin on all the classic Chinese-American food you know and love! Crab rangoon is really good and unlike any I've eaten before! And I love that you can get anything \"Spicy or No Spicy\" aweee to hear that just makes me get all warm inside and smile cause I know the deliciousness that is going to be in my mouth shortly!!! And I don't even like Chinese food that much - LOL!!"}
{"text":"Very good food! The sesame chicken is perfect. I've also tried the beef and broccoli. Their fried rice and noodles are perfect. It seems like they actually care about the food that they make. Their cook time is very fast compared to other places.  Portions are smaller than other Chinese fast good restaurants but the quality is much better.  Very clean environment.  Very nice workers. In a very convenient location. I wish they would deliver!"}
{"text":"I agree this is superior Chinese take out compared to most of what's available, but that bar is so low that it's not really saying much. I'm from Pineville/Fort Mill area and we happen to have 3 Authentic Chinese restaurants near by - Lee Cafe, Wan Fu & Chuan Wan Fu. Maybe I'm spoiled now or just snobby .. but the sesame chicken everyone previously raves about in their reviews I found be VERY SWEET. Like, I couldn't finish 1/3 of my dinner combo portion of it because it was so sugary and rich. Anyone who knows me, would be shocked to hear that because I have a sweet tooth and I generally prefer things on the sweeter side but this tastes out of place and unbalanced. Blegh. The fried rice is delicious and the egg roll was ok, just a regular fast food egg roll. I will say the customer service was on point and the place was PACKED with people placing and picking up To-Go orders. I will have to try something else next time"}
{"text":"It's a sad day!  This was one of my favorite restaurants in Champaign. Bo was clean, the food was fresh and the service was fast. All new owners, not a familiar face. Slow service and mediocre food to say the least. Won't be back. :("}
{"text":"This is a bare bones Chinese takeout place but it is hands down the best Chinese food in Charlotte. Everything is good and the portions are huge. I would recommend taking the food TO GO!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here because there were several positive Yelp reviews for this restaurant. The quantity & quality make this authentic food a great value.  The food was fresh & flavorful.  Excellent egg roll.  The crab rangoon was the best I've eaten in a long time.  Cooks were prompt about preparing everyone's orders.  Excellent & friendly service.  Highly recommend this eatery."}
{"text":"Service wasn't great. House rice was not good. Looks like a hood Chinese spot, but without actually tasting amazing."}
{"text":"I wanted 3.5 stars because it is better than average, but not amazing. Portions are okay, prices are good and the food is pretty yummy. They are fast and I noticed the kitchen and restaurant is SUPER clean. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Not sure if ownership changed again, but the food quality/recipes have gotten terrible.  Generals chicken is no longer the same, fried rice has no flavor, potstickers are even worse than the frozen ones before and even the soup is bad.  Very disappointing because the product for the cost used to be very good.  Time to find another take out place."}
{"text":"I love this place I always get the chicken and broccoli with less broccoli, the sauce tastes amazing! the ladies are on point and fast,. sometimes tables are not available it's a bit on the small size but it's still delicious!"}
{"text":"I've been eagerly searching for a 'go-to' Chinese place around my office, and I think I've finally found it ... thanks Yelp!  After reading some reviews, I decided to go with the lunch combo of sesame chicken, fried rice & chicken wings. They give you the choice of chicken wings (3) or an egg roll ... but I chose correctly going with the chicken wings. They have a unique flavor, I almost taste a little cinnamon on them ... very good. The quality of the chicken used in the sesame chicken was some of the best that I've had from fast/take-out places. The sauce had a great flavor. Best of all, the portion size was huggeee. I was able to make two lunches out of it.   TL;DR Give this place a try, you won't regret it! Sesame chicken FTW. $6.50 is a hell of a deal for this combination platter."}
{"text":"I love their potstickers - the thin kind.  We've tried a lot of dishes from BW and have not been disappointed.  Chicken Lo Mein noodles are tasty. The broccoli and garlic sauce is spicy and will wake you up.  Cashew Chicken is a frequent choice.  Lots of seating if you want to dine-in and well worth the effort to drive over here for take-out."}
{"text":"Finally found a decent take-out Chinese restaurant in Charlotte! Trusted Yelp on this one, and wasn't let down. Ordered the house lo mein and it's a huge portion with a good mix of noodles, meat, and fresh cooked (not canned & slimy) veggies. Also ordered the General's Chicken and it was delicious. The sauce was very pleasant and tasted homemade with a mixture of honey & spice. We'll be back! :)"}
{"text":"Food is always fresh, ask the vegies you like with tofu and they prepare the food as you expect.  Hot sour soup is always available and very tasty.  Crispy chicken wings or eggroll is included with your order.  Limited seats but the wait for one to be available is not long.  Takeouts are ready within 10 minutes.  Food is never oily as like any other chinese place you go to.  Aimee and her hubby (the owners) always will greet you like you are family.  Have been going to this resto at least once or twice a week place since 1997."}
{"text":"In debating 5 stars (WooHoo, as good as it gets') or 4 stars (Yay! I'm a fan), Im going for 5. Not actually because it is 'as good as it gets, as there are quite a few that are as good or better.  However, the ones that are as good or better are in the Full Service/Not fast food/more expensive category.   With that said, Best Wok is 'as good as it gets in the 'fast food category'. Lets face it, nowadays there is a fast food chinese place on every street corner, most of which are either awful/passable/not bad.  Best Wok is hands down the absolute best 'fast food chinese' around. In fact, it is likely better then other full service/more expensive category. But in the fast food category, it is far superior then any other in the the same category.  The folks are nice. The food is simply terrific. Lunch specials are fantastic, cheap and more then filing. You can get an egg roll or 3 chik wings with each lunch special. Both the egg role and chik wings are excellent. You can sub out the rice which is also very good and get lomein instead for maybe $1 or so more, but its well worth. Their lomein is great. Not greasy, good texture, great flavor.   Ive eaten an awful lot of different items on their menu, both lunch and dinner, and it never disappoints. It would be difficult for me to name what I like or would recommend simply due to the fact every single meal, chicken, beef, pork, seafood etc etc....are all terrific.   Give it a shot for lunch or dinner. After doing so, you will likely cross other fast food chinese places you frequent off your list. And again, just because its 'fast food', does not mean it is not fresh or high quality. It is always fresh and always high quality and again as I said earlier, its as good or better then MANY of the more expensive restaurants.  Happy Eating"}
{"text":"It doesn't even deserve 1 star but I don't have another option .. The service is HORRIBLE! Worst place I been in."}
{"text":"The food is good.. quantity is fulfilling.. orange chicken and kung pao are  nice .. can work on veg lo mein."}
{"text":"The food was great!  BUT,  the menu prices are not correct online. Today myself, and 4 co-workers ordered lunch from here, as another co-worker had Best Wok yesterday and it smelled heavenly. So we each fill out our choices, add up the prices,tax, etc for each and off our driver goes..she comes back, ALL the orders are higher. On average, the orders were $3.00 higher.  As it does say, prices may not be correct, but dang"}
{"text":"The egg rolls are excellent and you can't go wrong with the garlic chicken.  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I stopped in while traveling based on other reviews. I tried the orange chicken and egg rolls both were fantastic. The dining room is clean and larger than most strip mall Chinese joints."}
{"text":"Such a great place for some yummy food! Great menu for all of your favorite dishes. I prefer the Triple Delight and/or General Tso chicken,   Definitely get the chicken wings and crab Rangoon for your sides.   Ladies upfront are friendly and helpful.  I usually get takeout but there are tables if you choose to eat there for a change."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese place in town.  The staff is super friendly and they have always been happy to make some changes to dishes when I ask.  I introduced a co-worker to this place and he loves that you actually get veggies with your sweet & sour chicken rather than just \"Chinese chicken nuggets\" as he calls it.  The General Tso's chicken is my favorite and they will make it extra spicy if you ask.  The cashew chicken here is unique from every other cashew chicken I've ever had; the sauce is just a bit different and it's delicious.  I haven't had anything here I didn't like. As another reviewer noted, the owner will remember you if you come in a few times.  My mom was in the hospital a few years back and my dad and I came here after leaving the hospital; we got to the door just as they were closing up for the night, but he opened the door and waved us in with a smile.  I think it is his son who works the register a lot now and he is really nice too.  They are good folks here and I love to give good people my business.  They used to not accept credit cards but that changed a few years back which makes it easier to zip in if you don't typically carry cash."}
{"text":"Not much to say that hasn't already been said. Good, solid American Chinese food. Best in the area and best egg rolls I've ever had. I do wish they had Singapore noodles, but whatever."}
{"text":"Wow! This is such a great Chinese spot. Honestly, we had been avoiding trying it because it looks a little sketchy from the outside but seriously the yelp reviews don't lie. This is more of a take out place but they do have seats in case you want to eat in. The sesame chicken was probably the best I have had. You can ask for white meat and they will make it regular or spicy. We also got the Broccoli with garlic sauce- this actually came with water chestnuts and carrots so not sure if there was a mistake or what. The garlic sauce really wasn't spicy so ask for extra spicy if you like it spicy. The fried rice was just okay, nothing special. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Best Wok is my favorite Chinese place in Charlotte. A bold claim, as I've been to at least a dozen American Chinese restaurants just in east and south Charlotte alone, but I always come back to this one. Everything tastes just as it should, high quality ingredients, large portions, and its never bland. The moo shu pork is fantastic and their sesame chicken is always crispy without having globs of excess batter. And their lunch combos are enough for two meals. I really can't praise them enough and as Amanda said, if you're not in the mood to wait for a table at New Zealand next door, Best Wok is worth it."}
{"text":"I love the portion sizes. A nice place to stop into when you want some good Chinese food."}
{"text":"My first visit to this highly rated Yelper favorite lunch spot. I'm happy to say that the other Yelp reviews were not misleading, the joint serves up some very good Chinese chow. We were there at high noon, and almost every seat in the house was already taken. There were a couple of people in line in front of us (you order at the counter), but the line moved quickly. My lunch companion ordered Cashew Chicken with an egg roll, I order Szechuan Beef with chicken wings. Chicken wings instead of an egg roll? Hey, all I know is that they floated my boat, the wings were excellent. My lunch mate was very happy with his choice, as I was with mine. My dish was a little heavy in carrots, which seemed like a strange addition to this entrée. Did I mention that I loved the chicken wings? Not only were they crispylicious, they were crispy and delicious too! $16 for lunch for 2, including soft drinks, we had a great meal."}
{"text":"Two and 1/2 stars Chinese comfort food, grandma would approve.  Yu Shiang Scallops are not bad, pan fried dumplings are dark brown on only one side, the other two sides are mushy, Moo Shu Pork was pretty good but it only included 3 pancakes and it had none of the greens and veggies I expect with it, the fried rice is ok but far from the best (even for take out) Hunan Pork is ok but bland, nothing is spicy in spite of what the menu claims and everything shares a sameness. to it's taste.  Through the window I can see 4 guys working the woks ( Chef Tien works alone) yet the kitchen is not too swift.   I haven't tried any of the specials since I don't like to pay restaurant prices for take-out but the regular menu is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, had the shrimp fried rice, and it looks like they grill the shrimp first...I definitely will return."}
{"text":"Best Wok provides some of the best fast food in Charlotte and for a really low price. As someone who has eaten at Best Wok hundreds of times, I can honestly say they provide the best and most affordable Chinese food in Charlotte. I recommend their sesame chicken, which is always crispy and perfectly sweet."}
{"text":"I went there on Saturday for take out. The food was bland with no seasoning at all. The cashier seemed to have had an attitude. I ordered shrimp fried rice, chicken wings, pepper steak and sweet and sour chicken. I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Since moving from Seattle to Champaign, the family and I are all about trying the local eats! We decided to try Best Wok as we were all craving Chinese one night. We ordered a wide variety of dishes. We ordered mostly \"smalls\". They call come with rice and are fairly good sized portions for being called small. Cheap compared to what we're used to paying for Chinese. The reason for the 3 stars? Entrees that have meat in them have very little. My daughter's chicken curry had only a couple small pieces of chicken, runny sauce, and mostly veggies. She asked for medium spice and it didn't have any spice at all. My son had the same thing to say about his kung pao chicken. The lo mein our other daughter chose was good, and hubby and I were pretty pleased with the stuff we chose but yes, skimpy on meat, heavy on veggies for sure. We ordered delivery and it came in a very timely manner so we were happy with that!"}
{"text":"Very fast! GREAT hot and sour soup.  Portions are huge. I like that the lunch combo has the option of chicken wings instead of egg rolls. The fried rice isn't salty and they definitely pile it on! The chicken wings are yummy here!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out last evening from Best Wok.  We had orange chicken, hunan chicken, and sesame beef.  All off the selections were very good.  My selection was the sesame beef which was good, but I did not expect the beef to be breaded.   The menu didn't disclose that fact, but I did order that selection.  Next time, I will order another one of the spicy beef selections.  I am not opposed to returning again in the future, when I am back in town."}
{"text":"Best sesame chicken I've had in a long time! It's not hard to find a chinese restuarant but it is hard to find one that is both consistent and good! Best Wok is both! I would definitely recommend this place as your go to place for Chinese!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese Food I've had in Charlotte in 28 years! They take it up a step with expedient service. All of the time honored \"take out\" offerings are truly Better Here."}
{"text":"5 star Chinese food takeout!   I have never dined in, but have gotten delicious takeout from Best Wok several times over the last few months. The meat is high quality (always white meat chicken), the veggies are fresh and not overcooked & you can ask for no MSG in your dishes.  Takeout is ready on time - they are usually bagging it up as soon as you walk in the door. It's usually busy, so I know there's a large following.   Oh and if you're trying to go to New Zealand but don't want to wait an hour, hop in to Best Wok instead!"}
{"text":"Good Chinese that's made fresh.  The chicken and Chinese vegetables is good as well as schezuan chicken (little heat).  I don't think they have egg foo young.  Their egg rolls are delicious!  Fast service but not very friendly."}
{"text":"Best Chinese place for reasonable price in Charlotte. My boyfriend was on a search looking for shrimp with lobster sauce like it is nyc and we finally found it. Very satisfied. I accidentally ordered with white rice and forgot to ask for fried rice . The lady didn't hesitate and didn't charge me. Very friendly staff. Will be going back for sure ."}
{"text":"Fast and hot food ! Enjoyed the General Taos chicken. Like the flavor and the egg roll I had also ordered. Drink came with meal wth rice and one side. Portions were sizable, more than could eat."}
{"text":"Hooooray!  We finally found an awesome Chinese spot in Charlotte.  Sure, tin tin is great but it is a buffet and I am not always up for that.  My wife brought me here on a Saturday afternoon, it was not too crowded.  You order at the counter and then either wait for your to go or sit and they will bring your your food.  I got sesame chicken, the chicken was crispy in a slightly sweet and wonderfully savory sauce.  I ordered mine with fried rice and an egg roll.  I am a huge egg roll fan in general and these were top of the mountain.   They are pork egg rolls, obviously homemade and fried to perfection!  I cannot wait to go back for the egg rolls.  We also had a small chicken wing, which is only $3! And wonton soup!!  The soup was perfectly thick and tasty.  Two sesame chickens with fried rice and egg rolls, side of wings, egg drop soup and the bill was only about $21!  This is the best Chinese takeout/eat In I have been to in Charlotte.  Get to this place!"}
{"text":"I think my heart may break if we don't find a place that will deliver good Chinese food soon.  I wish Best Wok delivered, they would make a fortune I am sure.  Their food is fantastic.  They are right next to New Zealand Cafe and given my review of that place we should have gone next door to Best Wok for some fabulous food instead.  They have great prices.  Everything is cooked to perfection and it's super fast!  They are very kind and welcoming, not really a go-in-and-sit-and-eat kind of place, more of a takeout place, which is what we do anyway.  I only wish wish wish they would invest in some delivery guys/girls.  That would basically complete my life in regards to Chinese food."}
{"text":"On my quest to discover decent Chinese food in Charlotte (how can such a big town have such a good Chinese food drought??), my search took me to Best Wok, tucked off Monroe and Sardis Road North, right next door to New Zealand Cafe. I got excited when we walked up a few minutes before noon and were greeted with a line out the door. If they're this crowded, they have to be doing something right... Right?!!   I ordered the mixed vegetable lunch special and added chicken for $1. Because I'm high maintenance, I also asked for garlic sauce instead of the brown sauce it usually comes with. Lunch comes with fried rice and your choice of an egg roll or chicken wings. I went with the egg roll and wasn't disappointed -- it and the rice were both pretty tasty! The main dish was also really good! Veggies were fresh and crisp, it was a good sized portion (enough for left overs, so ask for it to go so you already have the box!), it was not drowning in sauce. My only complaint is that the garlic sauce was on the sweet side while I was expecting/hoping for spicy.   I'll be back for sure! Looking forward to trying the sesame chicken. My friend ordered that and I had total order envy!  ***Edit to include my second visit. I went for the sesame chicken this time and holy cow, y'all! The sesame chicken is to die for! Perfectly crunchy with big, fresh pieces of broccoli. The fried rice perfectly sops up the sweet and spicy sauce. And the egg rolls are still killer. We have a new favorite Chinese spot in Charlotte!! Happy dancing over here."}
{"text":"Great little spot for takeout.  They also have a row of small booths on site but all of the traffic on my visit was pickup.  They do not deliver.  Ordering was easy and the food was great!!  Portion sizes were HUGE.  My only disappointment was the \"firecracker shrimp\".  We were expecting more of a fried shrimp in a hot sauce (like bang bang shrimp) but it was a dish with very few shrimp literally swimming in a super sweet sauce, more like a sweet and sour sauce that was very watery.  It was barely edible.  Everything else we ate - sesame chicken, mu shu pork, dumplings, egg rolls, lo mein and fried rice was all delish!  I did hear the counter lady tell someone the fried rice has MSG in it.  I'm not sure what other menu items have MSG but I stuck with the steamed rice rather than the fried."}
{"text":"I was reluctant at first, mainly because of the location but this is one of my favorite places to get Chinese in Champaign. It's cheap (meal around $5-$7) and they have good lunch specials where you can get an entree with soup or an egg roll for $5. The employees are really nice and the egg rolls are delicious. The only down side is that they only accept cash."}
{"text":"Been getting take-out from Best Wok for about 15 or 20 years. Always good. Very consistent.  Always gets our order right.  My family likes their SA-Cha chicken, and the Pork with black bean sauce is also good.  Staff is friendly and accommodating of special requests.  Love the place."}
{"text":"Everything is so bland and over-breaded. I love Asian food, but I've given up on this place. The food is average at best."}
{"text":"Been coming here since 94 excellent food always. Consistent staff and friendly and very accommodating."}
{"text":"YUM Yum and yummmmmm   If you are looking for good Chinese food and not your typical chinese buffet where everything tastes the same, this is your place!  A secret little gem tucked into a strip mall.  We have never gotten anything that wasnt great in Best Wok.  We drive about 40 minutes to shop in Champaign and this often times is our restaurant of choice!  This place is also SPOTless!!!  Clean, Clean and then I think they clean some more!!  BEST eggrolls around and I LOVE the fried won tons!!"}
{"text":"Unlike most Chinese take-out places, they have a good selection of tables where you can eat in - whether you will want to is entirely your discretion. It isn't bad at all, with nice booths, rather than the standard (often black-lacquer) hard chairs, so it's very comfortable seating, but it can get a bit loud with noise from the kitchen, and orders being called in (they speak a bit loudly on the phone) and a fairly regular stream of people picking up the orders to go. Also, the tableware is not fancy - just a simple styrofoam plate.  That said, whether you dine in or pick up and take it home, the food here is solid, and well worth what you are investing. Like most places, they do not have (or I did not see) dinner combinations, so if you want to get a plate with rice and an egg/spring roll, go for lunch. Dinner will instead be a good portion, and by good portion I mean about as big as your head. If you get the smaller size, they cut back a bit on the meat, and make up the difference in rice. Still well worth it, but you may not have as much for leftovers or to share."}
{"text":"Been eating here for over ten years. Best black pepper chicken dish and great egg rolls."}
{"text":"Best Wok has been serving great Chinese food here for many, many years. I've worked down the street about 500 yards for 30 years, so I've eaten here a lot. I probably grab lunch here at least two or three times a month. It's very consistent.  The staff is family, and most of the same folks seem to have been there consistently since it opened.  This is a quick place for a lunch, or for take-out. I nearly always order mixed vegetables with chicken added, but I'll occasionally surprise the lady at the register and have their special of the day, or Cashew Chicken, or Moo Goo Gai Pan, or a steamed veggie entree. (They know my face as a bartender would, and usually start rattling off my order before I do!)  They have great egg rolls and crispy chicken wings, and they will cook your food the way you like it. No MSG? Check. Less oil? Check. Hotter or milder spices? Check. Just ask.   Atmosphere is early cheap lunch booth, and seating space is limited, which is probably why they do such a great take-out business. I just go there for the food, which I crave as a guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"Diasappointed after reading so many good reviews. The sesame chicken was just okay, as was the General and Orange Chicken. And they forgot to give us a container of fried rice which we only discovered when we got home. Chicken was way over cooked."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Charlotte. Awesome wings. Best beef/chicken and broccoli I have ever had. Awesome lunch specials. Great food and good pricing. Only gotten this food to go but they do have a small seating area. A must if you are craving Chinese food."}
{"text":"Wow...so didn't expect to get good food in this establishment.    Found Best Wok on my Yelp app (love that thing) while coming home from Wilmington.  Inside is very basic, run down looking and two ladies hard at work.  Many regulars came in that day and they new most of them by name and by what they ordered.  I ordered the Shrimp CHOW mein and the lady kept trying to tell me that I wanted LO Mein.  -__- no...I want chow please.  So after going back and forth for a good 2 min..she caved and finally gave me what I wanted.  I didn't want the noodles.  Give me Chow mein pleaseeeee.  My only complaint.  They're kinda bossy but I'd go back and just stand my ground again.  :-) It was HOT and TOO much for me to eat...so it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"Best Wok is hands down the best \"American\" Chinese food that I've had. The ingredients are fresh and the food is prepared with care. Whenever I go I ask for extra spicy and no msg and they happily prepare it for me. This restaurant is consistently delicious and they serve fresh and fast food. For first timers I suggest the sesame chicken, it's definitely a crowd pleaser and make sure to try the chicken wings."}
{"text":"I've had my fair share of Chinese food in Charlotte, and I must say that Best Wok ranks near the top. Yes, it's definitely Americanized, but that doesn't mean the taste and quality isn't there.   Some recommendations I have include sesame chicken, the chicken wings (YUM), Happy Family and Triple Delight. Must tries! I have gone several times during lunch and the portion sizes are generous and plentiful. I love that they don't skimp on the food, so it is definitely worth what you are paying for. This also gets 5 stars because of the service. The workers there seem happy to be there and are always smiling. That makes the visit that much more pleasant. I am excited to go and try other dishes on their menu. Give this place a try and you will love it!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Chinese food in town, the staff is very friendly and the food is always fresh."}
{"text":"Been going for 15+ years, best Chinese food in Charlotte. My favorite plates would be the triple delight, mixed vegetables, and any fried rice."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a to go order that I had called in on the phone.  The lady on the phone was pleasant and took my order quickly and with ease.  I came in about 20-15 later and it was ready.  Everything was correct.  It was decently priced with good portion sizes.   There is a lot of seating in the back for the restaurant if you choose to dine in! They were pretty busy with to go orders on a Saturday night, but everything managed to run smoothly.   My food was still hot when I got home.  The lo mein was a thicker than normal noodle, very delicious.  The vegetable egg rolls are good too!"}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful people, and time spent making a meal, I have eaten many a meal from my Best Wok, I have been away from ordering for a while, they remember me.  I used to order regular, on and off, maybe back on an upswing.  Love this place."}
{"text":"We had heard from multiple people this was the *best* \"takeout Chinese\" in the area, so we went with high hopes. I guess from a comparison standpoint (of what alternatives are \"in the area\") it may be better. But as far as overall takeout Chinese, this was completely average. My orange chicken was heavily battered to the point I could actually taste the cornstarch through the spicy sauce, and my husband's sesame chicken was the same situation. The crab rangoons were good, but pricey. This place didn't really live up to the hype in our experience, and I'd much rather try some other place in town then settle for this."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese in Charlotte, i lived 24 years in new jersey i should know a little bit about chinese food. They have the best house special fried rice and the sesame chicken is full white meat chicken breast good plus. They have a good seafood mix call happy family."}
{"text":"Best Wok is one of the better Chinese Take Out Restaurants in Charlotte...and I have tried a lot. Located off of Monroe in a strip mall it can be missed, but keep in mind it is a stop you should make.  Best Wok is mainly take out, but they do have a few tables if you choose to eat in. Because I don't live in the area we decided to eat there. For those who choose to eat in, order at the counter and your food will be brought to you. I started with the Wonton Soup, fabulous! Steaming hot with two wontons that were very flavorful. Next a Spring Roll. Although a little greasy, cooked just right with a crispy shell and cooked veggies inside. For my entree, I chose the Triple Delight. Beef, Chicken and Shrimp with Mixed Vegetables in a Spicy Brown Sauce. Whoa, it was huge! But I will say the Vegetables were cooked perfectly and I loved the brown sauce. As for the proteins, they were skimpy on the shrimp but overall a good dish.  As we enjoyed dinner we did realize it is definitely a take out restaurant with a lot of regulars that the owners own. Definitely worth a visit and when I am in the area I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"When I have a Chinese food craving this is the place I go. They're quick, and delicious! I love getting the sesame chicken from here with their spring rolls."}
{"text":"Pretty good carry out...generous portions, quickly prepared (within 10 minutes of calling) and overall delicious for the generic Chinese take-out restaurant."}
{"text":"Then Best customer service and lunch specials in town. We go here often for lunch. My order is always right and the ladies behind the corner are always smiling. I got to dish is the spicy sesame chicken with fried rice and chicken wings. A must have. Torri-Carolina Volkswgen"}
{"text":"My sha cha beef is onnnnn!! Moist chicken, juicy broccoli, and perfect white rice! The crab ragoon is also very flavorful."}
{"text":"The potstickers/dumplings were very good, but not enough for me to come back. The shrimp friend rice was a bit too hard for my liking, and the shrimp were extremely tiny. I've had shrimp fried rice all up and down the east coast and it was certainly a first.   This place gets consistently good ratings, but being that the fried rice and dumplings were the only things I ordered for take-out, perhaps the other selections are better. It's too far out of the way for me to try again. I'll be back, just to go to New Zealand Cafe next door instead."}
