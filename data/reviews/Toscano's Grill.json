{"text":"Over the past few years we have had lunch and dinner at Toscano's. I would best say it has not been the best meal but it is close and the food is okay.  They closed the  grill to redo the expand and redo the dining room. The small details is what is missing. Table clothes, a basket of rolls and bread. And more detail in the food presentation.  They price the meals at a level of a country club and attempt to \"sell it\" as a country club type setting, but its the details.  The Sunday brunch was not bad at all, but be careful if there are 6 or more at the table you will have a 20% tip added. At a buffett where you get your food. So the 20% is for a glass of water and a cup of coffee served to you. That works out to about $8.00 for the wateer and a cup of coffee. Hum . . . me thinks something is out of order here. Next store is the golf club area where you can stop in for a sandwich and a drink, but be ready to pay for the basket of popcorn on the table . . . really . . . your kidding . . . really  yeah really. I think they really should around them and see where the residents of Pebble creek go, see what level of service they get and what they pay. There is always lessons to be learned"}
{"text":"Went out to check out the community and had lunch before the ballgame today. The food was pretty good and we really enjoyed the sitting out on the patio. The service was slow and inattentive and they didn't return our credit card. When we called to check on it after the game, no one ever answered the phone. How can a restaurant not answer the phone???"}
{"text":"So some friends came over to trim our trees, they know what they are doing better than I. As usual with friends they do not want anything for doing. But we feel they should be rewarded in some way so we took them to lunch here Toscano's. Having been so disappointed by my adventure yesterday with ordering a French dip I was still wanting a good one. So today I repeated my order here and it came out as it should, sliced thin and against the grain with a deep rich beef flavour. I was so happy I did not have to bitch once again. As usual the service here is friendly and the atmosphere and view of the driving range is nice."}
{"text":"Toscano's may be taking advantage of the apparent captive audience at Pebble Creek. My good friend & I enjoyed their patio over lunch but food was mediocre. Grilled beef, chicken & shrimp were nicely prepared but salad greens looked like supermarket to go, iceberg lettuce, salads. Yes, we do know our beefsteak tomatoes and they were not included in the salad as advertised. In truth, my girlfriend enjoyed the chicken cheese crisp and the ice coffee was quite good. Service was just above being ignored."}
{"text":"The food here is terrible.  But I'm not surprised. The Chef has been laughed out of every restaurant in town. I guess he thought he could hide out here. The menu is dated plain and typical. Very borning.  The cheese ravioli was froze and straight out of a bag. The ceasar salad had wilted old lettuce.  I wish they'd get someone in here that knew what they were doing."}
