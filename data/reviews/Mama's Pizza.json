{"text":"Surprising that there aren't more reviews for this place.  Pizza is an individual preference, but from my experience, they have the best tasting pizza you can order.  So when it comes to taste, I would give them 4-5 stars.  However, their delivery service is mediocre.  They've screwed up 2 of 5 orders so far.  The first time, the pizza was missing the toppings.  I didn't open the box before paying, so it was only when the delivery guy left I noticed this.  I called and they issued me a credit.  The second time I ordered, they forgot the dipping sauce.  This time, I checked ahead to make sure everything was there, so I didn't pay for the sauce at the door.    They also aren't very fast when it comes to delivery (relative to the big chains).  They say it will be 50 minutes, but to give them a 15 minute grace period.  Usually they use the grace period.  And the time isn't guaranteed anyway.    I wish they were more more thorough with double-checking their orders, because I would love to give them a higher rating.  I still recommend their pizza, just make sure you check your order when it gets there before paying.  Or better, walk in and pick it up.  As an FYI, my experiences with them have been for the delivery from the Leslie location.  I'm not sure what the other locations are like."}
{"text":"Mama's Pizza is probably the only pizzeria that offers the vegan cheese option. So I jumped at giving it a try. I ordered an Olive press with vegan mozzarella cheese, which had egg plant, red peppers, broccoli and potato as toppings. The taste was 5/5, I like that it's stone baked and thin crust.   The only negative is that the pricing can get quickly expensive for a vegan pizza, but I'm definitely a fan. It tastes better than even regular pizza for me."}
{"text":"False advertising. It says on their flier that they deliver 24 hours, but no one answers the phones. Would have liked to try it but i cant order from a place that will not even bother to answer either number on the advertisement."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious pizza. Tons of cheese and loads of sauce. Do not go to some crappy casino Pizza Hut. These guys will deliver to your casino. Only downside is they won't deliver to your room. You'll have to meet them out front."}
{"text":"No reviews & open 24 hours, 7 days made us very leery to order but gave it a shot. Pleasantly surprised. Crust was excellent...not too thick. Great taste, good cheese & fast delivery."}
{"text":"Called them at 9pm on a Friday and they told me they were closed. When you say 24/7 I expect you to be open especially on a Friday night. Pizza could have been great, wouldn't know couldn't get any of it!"}
{"text":"Mama's got the thin slices, the cheap prices and the garlic salt and chilli love.  For under five bones you can get a soda and a large slice. They always have a cornucopia of varied slices on the quick. Truly something for everyone.  PEPPER POINTS: For their quick turn around when you call ahead for a 'Za. Go get it, Mama.   6/30"}
