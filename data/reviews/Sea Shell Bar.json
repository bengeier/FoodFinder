{"text":"Good burger and large salads.  The daily soups are definitely home-made."}
{"text":"I like it. It is what it is. Bartenders are nice and the outside (smoking) area is cozy.  Walking distance for me is a plus. I go in frequently for a quick couple drinks. Haven't had the food yet but looks good."}
{"text":"Waited for 20 minutes during lunch and was ignored till I payed for my drink and left. Waitress put another menu down after asking if I was waiting for someone to which I responded no, then walked away."}
{"text":"I live walking distance. The prices are decent, and love the fact that it's none smoking! No complaints here"}
{"text":"It was a bit hard to find seeing as it is not located on a very busy street. I was looking for a bar next to the airport and came across the shell. As soon as I pulled in I noticed great parking. I walked in and was immediately greeted and served by the bartender she was great. Just as the locals who are at this bar. Atmosphere is great and the drinks are better. Only downfall is they don't carry fireball. The excuse was they don't go with the trend or fad of today but smart business would suggest otherwise."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch.  Husband disappointed because they were out of the roast beef for the hot roast beef & fries.  So he opted for the reuben.  Said it was good, no fat.  I had the combination sandwich (ham, fried egg, cheese) which was very good.  Just enough yolk to ooze out just a bit.  Each came with chips & a pickle.  Only complaint was too much a/c on considering it was a chilly/rainy day."}
{"text":"They make just about everything \"home made\". The burgers are amazing, went on a Friday night for dinner and drinks with coworkers. Burger was cooked just right, nice and juicy. The lettuce, tomato and onions for being out of season were delicious and the ranch for my fries sealed the deal."}
{"text":"***This is an ambiance review only*** Stopped in for a beer after a long day of winter travel. Music was good (quiet enough to have a conversation, but loud enough to hear with all genres playing). Bartender was kind and always smiling. Bar was blah though, it only holds about 15 guests and the tv situation isn't great. This particular night it was 5dg out, but super toasty in here (except for the bathroom where it might have  been 6dgs) I'm in Pittsburgh once a month, so I'll update if I ever dine here. It deserves a return visit."}
{"text":"The Seashell is a great little local bar. I've been here a few times and we have yet to NOT have a good time. My friends and I always reminisce about the fun times we've had here!  (Like singing the Star Bangle Banner at the top of our lungs when they called last call. I'm not sure why we did, but hey, when in America! Right? Lol) The parking lot is a bit small but there is a medical office building close by you can park in.   They also have a nice patio area with a little fire place to cozy up to in the winter.   They have basic drink and specials and a simple food menu with nothing to write home about. They have a taco night too, I think Tuesdays.   If you're in the area and looking for a low key place with some fun locals, come here and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"When I come back to Pittsburgh, I'm constantly reminded what a lack of night life this city truly has.  The Sea Shell is no exception.  Let's start with the few good things.  This bar does not allowing smoking indoors, which is still legal in Pittsburgh apparently, and I truly appreciate that.  The drinks are decent, and the prices were supposedly reasonable (I didn't pay.).  The bartenders were friendly enough, and they had a small band.  The parking lot is tight, but I found a spot.  So let's get down to why I will probably never come back.  They close the kitchen at 9 PM.  9 PM on a Friday night.  Guys, this isn't acceptable.  This limits how much I can drink on a night out.  As if that wasn't bad enough, by 10:30, the entire place started to clear out for the night.  Ugh!  Yes, I was there with a group of co-workers, but I expect a bar to have people in it.   So essentially after having two drinks and not being able to eat and seeing the bar was clearing out, I left at 11:00 PM.  That's not even a night out.  That could have been the beginning of an evening.  Sorry, Sea Shell.  I can't recommend mediocrity."}
{"text":"You really cant beat the quality of food for this category. Wonderful fish fry and WOW the lobster bisque was excellent! My son had a great cheeseburger and my wife a nicely preparer turkey club."}
{"text":"This is a great small place to come and have a great time to enjoy the food,bartenders, and atmosphere!!!! All the bartenders are beautiful and best of all they know how to pour good drinks!!! You can't go wrong if you looking to have a great time talking and drinking!"}
{"text":"The hamburger and fries was very good! Nothing fancy but just a good hearty piece of meat and enough fries to l you up. Buffalo wings are very good. The sweet sauces are a little too sweet for me so I stick to the basics. It's a family bar/restaurant environment. I've been here with my young nieces/nephews. Worth checking out a couple of times."}
{"text":"the \"female\" cook came out and sold me on the ribs and they tasted as good as she said they would. Also they got 'new' fish items on the menu!.."}
{"text":"...it's been a while, but the place always has been a mainstay with the locals; teachers, soldiers, etc. I remember one time I stopped and sat at the bar and the bartender asked how I was. I said that I would like a draft and she walked away. She returned and again asked me how I was and again I said I would like a draft. She walked away again. She returned for the third time and asked me how I was and I said that I was fine and she went to get me my draft. I was pissed at first, but reconsidered it and haven't been such an ass since..."}
{"text":"I never give 5 stars, but here goes, I love this place. Stopped by for dinner tonight. It was excellent. Food and service was excellent, busy place, good happy hour crowd, reasonable prices. Check it out."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in moon twp.  Close to home (walking distance down a beaten path).  Bartenders always nice to me.  Used to be a regular but do not have the time anymore.  Bartenders still remember me.   Average pricing less than average 6 packs.  Bathrooms remodeled.  Has the friendly atmosphere of a dive bar without the dingy look and the dive bar nonsense.  Great patio for afternoon beers."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great locals bar that makes visitors free welcome,  great food, reasonable prices,  wonderful staff."}
{"text":"The soup of the day was homemade and delicious. Attentive and Effecient waitress. We ate mid afternoon lunch and it was quiet. We did not order drinks. The food was good. My friend eats lunch here a lot. It's casual."}
{"text":"This review is going to be short since I have only visited the Sea Shell Bar twice for Karaoke on a Saturday night. I believe they have karaoke on Thursdays as well. I have not tasted their food yet so I can not give feedback. The atmosphere is nice. It is lively and sometimes a little too crowded, if a small room crammed with people is an anxiety trigger for you. haha There seems to be lots of military visiting this bar since the base isnt too far away. Men in uniform isnt a bad thing,  or so I have been told**Cough cough**. ;)  The one TIP I have that is more of a WARNING is be careful pulling in and out of the parking lot because it sits right on the other side of a small hill and people come flying up over it. I have almost been hit coming out and have almost hit someone going in."}
{"text":"I went there to eat lunch with someone. One thing to caution you is that you need to be careful when turning in to the restaurant because opposing traffic is obstructed and people go flying down the road. My guest wanted to sit outside and there were tables avaliable. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich which was good and my guest had the \"Rachel\", which is a Reuben with turkey. We both enjoyed our meals. The service was ok. We really enjoyed this restaurant for a nice quick lunch. Reason for only 4 stars= We were sitting outside and we were we could smell the cigarette smoke of other patrons. Although the smoke wasn't very strong, it was not very pleasant."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I were staying at a hotel in Pittsburgh for the night & just wanted to find some place we could grab & few drinks & some food. Sea Shell Bar fit the description of what we were looking for, & it was pretty close by. It was a cute little place, half bar / half restaurant. We sat at the bar & were quickly greeted by the bartender. You could tell who the regulars were, there was lots of friendly banter going on. The drink specials were pretty good but they ended at 7pm. Not a huge variety of drinks but I wouldn't expect more out of a little bar in Pittsburgh. The food was surprisingly good for bar food. The bartenders were really nice, pretty attentive. All in all we got what we wanted out of the night so we were satisfied :)"}
{"text":"Very interesting bar, there are a few people i know that go there almost every weekend. Drink service is good, the bartenders are friendly"}
