{"text":"The parathas are fabulous! Simple, straightforward, non-gimmicky, lovely, soft and fresh parathas! The Dahi Poori is wonderful as well - no fake sauces, and a lovely mix of ingredients. Clean, simple and neat place. Go get that chaat craving satisfied :)"}
{"text":"So many good reviews that I wanted to try eating lunch here.  It was a very disappointing experience.  It is located  in the Woodman's parking lot and has no ambiance at all.  Hole in the wall place with bare bones seating.  I had the lunch special which was two curries with meat, rice , roti, and some sweet dessert .  Food was mediocre.  The hostess wasn't even sure what one of the meats was as she is vegetarian.  The sweet donut like thing was so sickening sweet I could not eat it.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"We are vegetarians and have ordered Chole Bathura, Samosa Chaat and Pani Poori. Nothing was good and especially Chole Bathura as it was smelling awful, must have prepared with the oil already used for non-vegetarian dishes.  We are never going back to this restaurant again and vegetarians, be-aware."}
{"text":"I have tried this place about 3 times. The first time I ordered Chicken Biryani and this is not something you can ever try here. It was just overcooked turmeric rice with some Chicken in it. Was very disappointed, but the place is run by Punjabis and I know Punjabi food tastes good. So I decided to give it another shot. I ordered Chole Bature and my wife ordered the Chole Puri. Bature was good- soft and crispy. Puri was good too. Chole was on the higher side of OILY. If you are health conscious like us, its not a place to be as we felt the oil in excess. You won't mind if you are fan of oily food. Masala Chai was good. They have good fresh Indian sweets. IF YOU WANT CHEAPEST INDIAN FAST FOOD, THIS IS THE PLACE. Ideal for students who miss home."}
{"text":"Recently moved to Madison, and was pretty disappointed by the amount of Indian restaurants that lacked flavor. Chaat Cafe will indulge all the cravings you may have for \"chatpata\" food (and for me it's all the time). I love that their papdi chaat has pomegranates in it. My husband inhales their samosa chaat.   Reading the reviews below seems like people's overall disappointment of a new restaurant (not having chai cups etc). But they're new, and figuring it out. And for being new, they have a generous menu with an insane amount of food. They'll figure out what works and what doesn't. I just wish it was closer to where I lived."}
{"text":"This place is simple, cheap, and super authentic. The food is a combo of Indian street food and what you'd find in an Indian restaurant. The service is great. It's a great place to check out and support"}
{"text":"As a starved Indian college student, this is my little slice of home with the best Chaat in town yet.  Chaat - An Indian savory snack that is too die for.  We ordered what I almost thought was an entire menu for two people.   Biryani - super yumm definitely try it  Papdi Chaat - Amazingggg  Samosa Chaat - could've been better  Methi paratha- really nice  Biryani wins hands down"}
{"text":"Authentic Flavor and very fresh I got the Manchurian Chicken wrap which had a wonderful spice to it..my friend got the chicken bryani which was great as well..the menu is huge with many options along with dessert"}
{"text":"Went twice. First time showed up with wrong order and the other time food was without salt. Won't recommend it."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty and friendly. They let me sample their sweets before purchasing. Delightful."}
{"text":"Addictive menu! Sweets, snacks, and a huge menu of freshly made chaat. I could eat Pani Puri until I explode! :) Haven't tried the thali lunch special, but excited to try it soon."}
{"text":"I am upgrading my review from the first time I visited Chaat cafe.   The owner has been very open about listening to all issues customers had and have improved service tremendously. Food here is awesome. And I can say it because I have been visiting this place almost very week from the time it opened. Quality of food has consistently been good. The service is now fast and efficient. The place is always nice, inviting and clean.   For anyone who hasn't tried this place yet. I would say you are missing out. Their chole bhatura and puri chole are out of this world. They have a variety of paranthas that are super yum. Very home made feeling. The stuffing were in abundance and the parantha itself was thin and very very fresh. Someone in the kitchen at Chaat cafe is cooking with a lot of love.   Give this place a try. I assure you, it will be your go to Indian restaurant in Madison!!! It surely has become ours."}
{"text":"Such a breath of fresh air for the Indian cuisine scene. This Indian-street food style restaurant is exactly what the public needs to break from the standard \"banquet-style\" food you get at most Indian restaurants. People need to know that Indian food is more than just chicken tikka masala. I hope the menu continues to expand while still focusing on the chaat and other street food items. I hope they add things like pav bhaji, vada pav, paneer sandwiches, and possibly some Indo-Chinese items. This will make this restaurant truly unique in what it offers the greater Madison community."}
{"text":"Good place for sweets! Good service! Good chicken biryani. Check this new place out. Also close to the Indian grocery and woodmans."}
{"text":"Great comfort food. Reminds me of the streets of good ol' Bombay."}
{"text":"The chaat was a bit too salty (though good), but the parantha was great (we got aloo). Informal place, e.g., everything served on paper/plastic/styrofoam. They could offer to heat up the \"wet\" sweets but overall it definitely hit the spot and I would go back!"}
{"text":"My new favourite breakfast place, they serve you steamy, freshly made. It taste fresh and, yummy, just like Indian food that I had in India.They have breakfast, lunch and dinner, and the price is very reasonable."}
{"text":"I love Indian food but dont eat it nearly often enough.  A friend mentioned this place so I was excited to try it.    I tried the Special Chaat and a Chicken Tikka Wrap.  Both were good, fresh, lots of flavor, I prefered the Special Chaat.  I got it regular but it was still quite spicy.  Portion sizes were a little small for the cost.  My wife asked me to bring her home an order of Rogan Josh but it was not a normal menu option."}
{"text":"Madison was in need of a place like this, was very excited about this place. Tried a few dishes: Chicken Biriyani - Bad Paneer roll - Bad Chole battura - Below average. Overall disappointed in this place. Not sure how the chats are though, doubt ill be going back to try something again."}
{"text":"PROS: Cheap, large portions, good for lunch takeout CONS: Hole-in-the-wall, lack of ambiance  Chaat Cafe probably lies somewhere between 3 and 3.5 stars. The restaurant is very new, very bare-bones, and the staff seems very inexperienced. The food I had was tasty and flavorful but quite heavy. The prices seemed cheap, which aligns with the order-at-the-counter concept. It would probably be a good place to have takeout if you're in the area, but it's definitely not a spot to go out of the way for."}
{"text":"New establishment still working out kinks.  The selection and quality of Indian snacks is good.  But it's a cafe and I expected to find a chai-wallah but instead got a surprised look when I asked for Indian style tea.  They were so unprepared they didn't have a proper cup and lid to go.  Come on!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best place for the Fast eats ,  I loved their parathas, the best parathas in town, The staff are courteous, the food quality is good and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Love the paratha platter and chhole bhature. If you're craving authentic North Indian food under $10, it doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"Solid food and interesting concept. My wife and I had the chicken tikka roll and the samosa chaat. Samosa Chatt ($6) is basically the chili fries of India cuisine. Fried samosa smothered in a chickpea curry with onions and cilantro. It was incredibly tasty! The chicken tikka role was pretty tasty too.   I guess the shop has been open for less than a year. There's canned sodas, tea, lassis, and free water. Given it's proximity to Woodman's grocery, I suspect we will be back here many times!"}
