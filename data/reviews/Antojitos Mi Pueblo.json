{"text":"The best mango chamoyadas in Phoenix!!!!!!!!  Hot and new and fresh authentic Mexican food made to order. Check out the tort as as well."}
{"text":"I had the Chamoyada when I was here, and it was delicious. Plenty of mango, chamoy and tamarind candy. Great Mexican treat to have when its 100+ degrees outside. Good customer service and never disappoints. Come check it out, little place but great refreshing flavors."}
{"text":"Great Mexican treats and raspados. I recently had the diablito raspados which is spicy and refreshing at the same time. Another favorite of mine is the Tostilocos. Stop in next time you're in DaSlope and get your grub on. At Anyojitos Mi Pueblo, they never disappoint."}
{"text":"OMG...The best fresh fruit raspados you will ever have. I love the mangoniada and diablitos  its my favorite raspado. I come here at least  once a week. I'm glad I found this place and its  really close by me. Its always clean and all the staff are great."}
{"text":"The Chef Alberto Perez serves up exceptional quality food that is all homemade and fresh. This family owned and operated restaurant  is such a great neighborhood spot. Fabulous food and service. We will continue to be loyal customers. :-) :-)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in town. The steak burrito came with rice and beans topped with fresh Pico de gallo. The food is authentic and every thing he prepares is fresh."}
{"text":"a very small hole in the wall type of place., the cook/owner  very caring person,comes out and talks to the guess,making sure everything is fine,which is a nice experience..   I say the tacos is what brings this place to shine.. what ever ur in the mood for., the cook can usually will make it.,"}
{"text":"Their raspados are super bomb! Specially the fresas (strawberry). Haven't had much of their food just tacos and they were good. But for sure the raspados are worth having! They are big and they are made fresh."}
{"text":"Delicious diablitos and chamoyadas, clean interior, and friendly staff.  They don't skimp out on the mangoes and chamoy sauce either.  Expect a bit of a wait when ordering which I suspect is due to cutting up the fruits to order. Either way it's a great treat for the hot Arizona weather."}
{"text":"Bomb raspados!! Sister recommended and surely it was legit!! 
So many raspados/Mexican shaved iced to pick from!! 
Will try out everything slowly, but surely! 
Must try the Sandia/Watermelon and Tamarind flavor, it is like biting into the fruit itself, super fresh and natural!! Fresas con crema were deliciously topped with shaved coconut, pecans and granola! Yum!!! :)"}
{"text":"Love this place, its a small place, service is great and fast. They offer a variety of items from sweets to savory foods. My daughters love their cotton candy cones & I love their tacos & they're salad. ( who doesn't love chips & salsa)"}
{"text":"Best raspados in AZ....what you see in the pictures is what you get. They make them fresh and right in front of you. My family and I will most definitely being coming back. And lucky for us, they're less then 5 minutes away."}
{"text":"This place is super delicious if you have any craving for shaved ice (raspados). I used to drive 15 - 20 min to a different place for my raspados, but come to find out that they opened one next to the high school I went to and it's 5 min away!!  Definitely love the chamoyada. The only thing is that they close early when you're having a craving for it at 7pm. Melissa is a nice employee whom I've know for a few years, and she makes my raspados very deliciously."}
{"text":"Antojito's is the real deal for Mexican food and Tacos. The food and service was exceptional!  Nice atmosphere too. The owner/chef came out and helped me pick a menu item and then proceeded to make it for me. It was so sweet. He takes a lot of pride in serving his food to patrons. The food is made with LOVE!  I got the 3 taco plate rice and beans for $5.00 which came with a basket of chips and salsa.  So much food for $5.00.  It was delish! I will be back and tell plan to tell my co workers and friends.  Try this place soon!! You will be happy you did. PS it's a small place in a strip mall and easy to drive by so keep your eyes out for it."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best rasposdos with real fruit purses.  Only place I buy my Mangonadas."}
{"text":"Antojitos Mi Pueblo is a great Mexican food takeout place.  My wife and I had lunch there last week, and the food was amazing.  First, we had the chips and salsa, and it was really good.   I got the Asada street tacos, and they were great.  My wife had the Flautas, and that was even better.  They are known for there Ice Cream, but I'm sure they will soon be known for there food.  I would give Antojitos Mi Pueblo 5 stars, but they don't have fountain drinks, and their venue could be a little nicer.  Overall I will definetely come here again, but probably for takeout."}
{"text":"ANTOJITO's my # 1 GO TO, Mexican Juices tried for 1st time,all r wonderful, tried the lemon' Ice, better than my lemonade! I was more than pleased w/the Camerone Burrito, so fresh,lightly spiced, w/crema. Can't wait till Wed 1.10.18, me,sister & friends,
Come see me I've got coupons
For Wed specials!!"}
{"text":"Omg yummy!! Never tried a chamoyada until yesterday and it was to die for! And the customer service was outstanding!! Drove 30 min away to try this place and will defiantly be making the trip back again soon!!"}
{"text":"The reviews I've read are mostly for their wonderful fruit drinks. My review will be for the non Mexican dishes which are fantastic in their own right. The roast beef dish, the brisket, steaks and stews are some of the tastiest dishes in this city. The meats tender and tasty all served with multiple vegetables and great broths for the soup and stews. The prices are surprising for food this good. Always ask for any specials on the day you go and you will be very pleased. The chef can cook anything always seasoned just right with great breads as well. The service is friendly and the chef always comes out to talk with you about his food."}
{"text":"great place for a nice cold drink! i got there mango chamoyada & raspado tropical. there food there is great too. makes me miss mexico! will be back to try out more of there drinks and food. the vibe of this place does make
you feel like your in tijuanna which i love."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough! The best fish tacos I've ever had, and arguably the best asada burro too! The Chimis are also spectacular. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went for Raspados. They were expensive and not very good. Pretty though. The staff working there was really nice and the food looked decent priced."}
{"text":"Maybe it's the heat but the strawberry and coconut raspado is flat out amazing. Didn't order food this go round but being open six months they don't have a menu. They said they offer a variety of tacos and tortas and rumor is they are great. Very friendly. They have piqued my curiosity. I will be back soon to check out the rest of the mystery fare."}
{"text":"Best chamoyadas around! They put a good amount of fruit on their chamoyadas! Other places don't put any fruit at all. This place is really more bang for your buck. I recommend the mango chamoyada!"}
{"text":"If you're into Mexican munchies and their exotic styles of shaved ice, then you have to check this place out. They have the best mangoniadas in Phoenix. I drove half an hour to enjoy this tangy, spicy, sweet delicious icy dessert that garnished with fresh mangos and thin rolls of tamarind candy. It sure helps beat the heat!"}
{"text":"This place is super yummy!  It's very clean and the staff is super nice and helpful.  I have been ordering the raspados and tostitos regularly and have never been disappointed."}
