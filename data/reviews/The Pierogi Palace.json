{"text":"Great variety of pierogies but several that I wanted on the list were not available which is disappointing .  Sauerkraut balls were delicious ---must have!  . And the pierogies were great.  Stuffed cabbage was decent but very average. Nothing like my moms.    However the cook took the order and was very harsh and rude to us. We are visiting from out of state and made an hour drive so we stayed but my 19 yr old was so upset with how she spoke to me that she wouldn't even place an order.  Normally if someone treated me this way I would have walked out.  However food was so good so I'm glad we stayed.    Be prepared to Go for the food not for any kind of pleasantry    Prices are very good.   Would've liked to have ketchup available for potato pancake."}
{"text":"This place has some of the quickest, cheapest, and tastiest lunches on Vine Street! They have a variety of flavors that will keep you coming back for more, because no two visits will be the same. Plus, you can take some home to feed the family on a budget! I recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Fab!! They have any kind of pierogi you could want, and will make any they don't have at the moment within a few days notice if you order a dozen. They also have ready made food like stuffed cabbage that's super yummy. Walk in, pick a flavor off the board, grab some lunch to go, you'll be all set. My staff sends me on outings here to pick them up things constantly. Love!!"}
{"text":"This was the first time trying the place and i am so glad i stopped in after work.  The service is great very friendly and recommended some very delicous pierogi.  I got 4 dozen to go, i got irish potato, bourbon chicken, buffalo chicken and pepperoni pizza.  I got home and fried 4 of each of them up in butter and they were the best i ever had.  The bourbon chicken was my favorite followed close behind by the pepperoni and buffalo chicken which tied for 2nd.  The irish potato were 3rd put not bad by any means, reminded me more of the classic pierogi with a very suttle and smooth leek flavor.  I will definitely be back for more good by mrs. T's hello amazingness. Oh and i will be stopping in soon to try the dine in option and let everyone know how that is!"}
{"text":"I used to go to the one at the west side market - but this one is so much closer to home.   They always have a great selection of different types but the basic are amazing too!  The Irish Cowboy with cabbage and potatoes is my favorite - well and the buffalo chicken.    The dessert ones are great too - apricot and prune - ooohhh and their cheesecakes!"}
{"text":"Wow!!!!!  I would rate Pierogi Palace at 6 stars if I could!   I have passed this place soooo many times, not realizing what I had been missing.   I dined at Bistro 185 a few weeks ago, my dinner entree was just ok, but the pierogi side was outstanding.  In making small talk with the server, he mentioned the piergois came from Pierogi Palace.   I made it a point to visit this past Saturday afternoon, and the counter-person could not have been nicer.  I mentioned to him, how I found the place, and inquired as to what variety I would have had at Bistro 185.   He mentioned potato/cheese/garlic.  The price, $1.00 each or $12 per dozen.  I happily ordered 1 dozen, which had just been made the day before.  He also mentioned that there is a 5 day shelf-life, before they need to be frozen.  I prepared them last night for dinner, sauteing with onion in butter and olive oil and the end result was OUTSTANDING!!   My family really enjoyed these pierogis.  I can't wait to return to try other options!"}
{"text":"Brought some pierogis home, fried them up with some onions and peppers and I am hooked!  Absolutely delicious!   I have tried the cheeseburger, potatoes and jalape√±o, and potato and horseradish.  Can't wait to pick up some more!"}
{"text":"The owner is so cool.  It's not just a shop now to buy ur pierogis for home but a restaurant too.  It's so nice there's a willoughby location now too so I don't need to drive to WestSide Market :) LOVE!!!!!"}
