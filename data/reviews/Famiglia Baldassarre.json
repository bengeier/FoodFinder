{"text":"THE BEST KEPT SECRET ON GEARY AVE. 

Woah. I went here for lunch today and it is insano how great this pasta is. I got the down low from a friend that lives nearby. 

Correct me if I am wrong, but Famiglia Baldassarre is a shop that provides fresh pasta for some of the best restaurants in Toronto. They're mostly an outfit to supply these great restaurants, but apparently for only TWO HOURS a day between Noon-2 PM (only from Monday-Friday? Am I making that up?), they will serve up their goods to the public, hot and fresh. 

There were two main options (apparently there are two options for this hour every day) today, one spagettini with two options for sauces, and one pumpkin raviolo. I love a nice stuffed pasta, so I went for the the pumpkin option... TO DIE FOR. Draped in a buttery sauce with a healthy dose of pecorino, it was simple and perfect. I totally understand why people line up for these little pillows. 

There are a few little tables inside and a few little wooden tables outside on some days. OR you can be a dear, get your pasta to go and enjoy it in a nearby park. 

Get here. Apologies that I might be spoiling the secret. Get here fast."}
{"text":"Amazing and delicious!  Two choices of reasonably priced pasta dishes daily plus other non pasta items.  And fresh pasta and sauces to take home.  Downsides, only open for 2 hours daily, huge line ups out the door, long waits, only a few seats to eat in, limited fresh pasta selection for take home compared to the huge variety they make, nowhere to park - very stressful experience."}
{"text":"The BEST pasta in the world

Outrageous I know, but the BEST pasta I've ever had was NOT in Italy, it was right here in Toronto.

I probably go out to eat pasta more than anyone else you know.  There's just something SO comforting and delicious about FRESH pasta and I can never get enough.  I found out about Famiglia Baldassarre online and I only wish that I knew about this place sooner.  They also supply their pasta to a few restaurants in Toronto (clearly I need to find the list of these restaurants).  A big con is that they are closed on the weekend and close at 5pm on the weekdays :(  So you have to plan accordingly!

They make all their pasta in house right before your eyes and honestly this place is a pasta lover's dream.  There is very limited seating but you can also take your pasta to go.  I've tried two dishes.  Tagliatelle with meat ragu, and spinach and ricotta ravioli with butter and reggiano. Hands down the FRESHEST and most delicious pasta I have ever had in my ENTIRE life.  Pasta in Rome, Venice and Milan do not even come close.  I wish I could wrap the tagliatelle around myself like a cocoon and just have access to eat it all day long.  I know that sounds a little crazy, but honestly that is how good the pasta is! The ravioli were SO incredibly light and almost melted in my mouth.  This is simple pasta at its finest and words can't really do justice. 

For dessert I tried their homemade ricotta and peach gelato.  I'm usually not a fan of fruity gelato but this was the equivalent of eating a super sweet peach!  I can't wait to try more flavours 

I seriously cannot stress enough - this is the WORLD'S BEST pasta and I dare someone to find better pasta in Toronto.  Famiglia Baldassarre is a literal pasta heaven on earth.  I'm SO in love!!"}
{"text":"OMG I am so happy I had a chance to try the pasta from this place. They sell fresh pasta and are only open for lunch from 12-2. The day I tried it, my sister in law walked in just after 12 and they had sold out two customers after her. Apparently they make only two kinds of pasta with the choice of tomato sauce, meat sauce or a buttery cheese sauce(I think it's Parmesan). I never knew that a pasta so simple could be so incredibly delicious. I had the tagliatelle with the buttery sauce and it was mind blowing. The sauce was so light yet flavourful. My husband had the ravioli with tomato sauce, my sister had the tagliatelle with meat sauce and my brother had the ravioli with butter sauce and they were also extremely delicious. I prefer noodles over stuffed pastas, but these ravioli were the best I've ever tried. I'd recommend anyone that's in the area around noon to get some pasta from here, you won't regret!"}
{"text":"I wish this place would stay a secret forever but it has been gaining seriously attention lately! Come here before it opens, around 15 minutes before the line already starts to build outside. At that time I was maybe 8th in line. When you get into the line inside its so exciting watching them make the pasta! The line didn't really die down by around 1pm but they were also still not sold out by then if you end up here later. 

We ordered our food but even being 8th in line, all the seats were already taken. So we were just awkwardly holding our plates while waiting for someone to leave. Be prepared to eat fast, this is NOT a place to linger because other people will be hovering and staring you down for your seat next! 

I got the buttered tagliatelle ($10), going for the pasta purest taste. And my friend got the red sauce and a plate of crudo prosciutto to share for a steal of $5. The food comes out fast. The buttered noodles were simple and carb-licious. There is something so good about fresh pasta a little bit chewy and savory with the cheese. 

I also got some frozen pasta to take home, and again it was great for under $3 I got either 1 large or 2 small portions of pasta to make a home. I also got their house-made ice cream after in milk flavor, not the smoothest but still good though I'm not sure if I'd get it again. 

I would definitely come back again! but its hard to as they are only opened weekdays 12-2pm and thats a short window of time!"}
{"text":"I wish this place was open for dinner. I had the fortunate opportunity to grab some fresh pasta and lunch. I really wished I had a chance to try their persimmon sorbet"}
{"text":"Their tomato pasta is my favorite and i recommend it to anyone who's never been here. Chris was so helpful in helping me decide my entree and dessert, which was the apple crisp topped with sweet rum from Portugal. To top it all off, they gave me a slice of red velvet that totally blew me out of this galaxy. I love their decor and everything else in between. Plenty of parking here so don't worry about taking twenty minutes to find parking."}
{"text":"If it weren't for the line of people eagerly and patiently waiting outside for Famiglia Baldassarre to open for lunch (plan to arrive 15-20 mins before noon), passersby wouldn't even know this place exists! 

It's next to Dark Horse, so I conveniently grabbed an espresso before getting in line.

I enjoyed the ravioli stuffed with ricotta and spinach - simple yet AMAZING - in white sauce along with a side of broccoli & cauliflower and my dessert was a raspberry gelato bar (handcrafted). 

Although they're only open for lunch from 12-2 pm Tuesday to Friday, you can purchase fresh pasta and sauces to prepare a delicious meal at home. 

Seating is limited and there's a constant line of people waiting to get in, so enjoy your meal but don't linger.

The lemon gelato bar is so refreshing!"}
{"text":"PILLOWS FROM HEAVEN
melt in your mouth goodness 
Worth the wait! Get there 20 mins before opening! 
Prosciutto and ravioli were amazing 
Very friendly and accommodating staff.
Only about 10 seats, but the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST pasta in Toronto! Freshly made everyday with flour imported straight from Italy, the noodles are absolutely the star of the show. The shop is only open for lunch Tuesday through Friday for two hours (noon and 2pm) but I honestly think it's worth taking a day off work just to eat here.

Everyday, you have a choice of two daily pastas. I tried the Cappellacci Verdi ($13) and the Tagliolini Funghi ($10) and I was in heaven - this pasta was better than most of the pastas I had in Italy last summer! 

The Tagliolini Funghi is topped with mushrooms, a little butter sauce and some reggiano. I love how something so simple could be so good! Here, the pasta really does shine. I was a little skeptical at first glance when I didn't see much sauce but I was surprised to find that the light butter sauce actually highlighted the light and bouncy texture and flavour of these handmade noodles. No extras needed!

The Cappellacci Verdi (spinach pasta) was cooked perfectly with a light springy texture. The inside was stuffed with a duck filling that just exploded with the most amazing rich flavour. A healthy dose of buttery sauce and duck braise highlighted the magnificence of the pasta.

If eating in, I would also strongly recommend getting a side of prosciutto as well. Only $5 for a generous dish of delicious crudo straight from the Emilano Region!

If you're ever in the area, make sure to take a detour and drop by for lunch. I guarantee you'll be talking about it for days. Chances are, you will probably end up buying some fresh pasta to take home with you too! I can't wait to eat here again."}
