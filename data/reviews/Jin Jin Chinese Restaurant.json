{"text":"I ordered a large order of Chinese Vegetables to go with my dinner. I got home & found a bowl full of cooked onions & a few carrots. I was so disappointed in this. I called them & informed them of this & the mgr acted as if I was lying. What happened to customer service. Needless to say I will no longer be a patron of this business anymore."}
{"text":"Read a lot of good reviews before I went. Unfortunately I can't say the same. Won't be back...see Carolyn's review."}
{"text":"My favorite place to pickup food. Reminds me of NYC food. The chicken wings are the perfect size and the pork refried rice is delicious. My favorite is the sweet and sour chicken and their egg rolls as well as chicken and broccoli. The best Chinese food takeout in town."}
{"text":"For service & price they're hands down my favorite take-out. Now I will be perfectly honest, it isn't legitimate \"CHINESE\" food... but it is a good Americanized Edition. To those looking for upscale authentic, try a plane ticket and an open mind. 

I have been ordering my take-out from here pretty regularly for a few years now, and on average I get pretty great stuff. There are the occasional less than par nights, but to be honest, it's never been horrific. (if that changes, I'll let you know) Overall, if you are looking for quick and good chinese take-out without too much hassle and at a good price, this is your place. 

Oh and a little bonus...just know that this family is pretty cool and I've been grateful for the friendly service I've received over the years (even when they are super busy they will nod, wave, and or share a quick smile)."}
{"text":"I have no relationship with this place but I know the owner is Chinese and I speak Chinese.  I will relate all the good comments to them when I stop there again.  One of my sisters also has a similar business in New Jersey and has lots of business from local due to their good personality and my brother-in-laws is a good chef.  My sister was a high school teacher before moving to this country and she speaks 4 languages. Many years ago, Chinese move to US didn't have high education, most of us can cook well and we love to eat well.  Restaurant is a good business to handle.  I've been to Jin Jin to buy fast food a few times because it was too late for me to cook.  The lady was very sweet.  I only ordered Chicken and Broccoli, the portion was good.  I'm sure they will be very happy to see all your supports."}
{"text":"We wanted Chinese food, and we wanted it fast! I ordered the Vegetable Mai Fun, and it was really good. Not sure I've ever had Mai Fun before, but I was pleasantly surprised. Really good noodles. My husband got a tofu dish, and said it was good as well. Good food, cheap prices."}
{"text":"Jin Jin restaurant highly recommend, not that big, but the food are really good. We ordered orange chicken,Sichuan beef and seafood delight,which are all really good! Right choice to come!:)"}
{"text":"Be careful they charge extra dollars in the bill.  I ordered my food yesterday from work, and In my break time I went to pick up my food. They messed up my order but other thing is they charge wrong amount in my bill. I m sure they did it intentionally by thinking most customer do not check their bills.  They charged me extra $3 of my total. It's not a mistake, it's cheating I believe. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"We love Jin Jin.. the lady at the front who answers the phone is always very nice... a little hard to understand sometimes but still very sweet. we love the Egg rolls, the crab and cream cheese Rangoons, and General Tao's Chicken! The ONLY bad thing I will say is... You cant get Swt. tea without lemon floating in it... the make and package the tea in Soup containers and all of them have lemon in them and I hate lemon!! 
Overall a really yummy place... but I do agree they do need some updating and renovations."}
{"text":"Where to start. Owners don't want to wash any dishes. Everything including drinks is served in disposable containers. The food, just not Freah tasting. Ordered Kung bo chicken extra spicy and wasn't spicy at all. Old, dilapidated dwelling with no attention to detail including food. Best go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Ordered from here for the first time & I was VERY disappointed. The sweet & sour pork was undone and the egg roll and rice were very bland and had no flavor.    They also need to do some work in this place because when you walk in it looks like the owners could care less of first impressions & or about the upkeep of their business."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken with garlic sauce - there's no reason why the chicken was red.  We also ordered the wonton egg drop soup, which was bland and had yellow food coloring(?)!  Note to self-will not be a repeat customer"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. The food is always greasy, and never what you ask for! I've tried giving them the benefit of the doubt and going back, but that hasn't worked for me."}
{"text":"Reviewing Chinese places like this is almost like reviewing a chain. It's nearly impossible for one to stand out. i suppose they should receive high marks because the person that answered the phone spoke English without me having to guess if she understood. 
However, i did request my General Tso spicier, and although she did repeat that it was spicy when i picked it up, it wasn't. Broccoli and rice were good, chicken was good aside from not being extra spicy as desired. 

Ready quick, decent taste, standard prices."}
{"text":"Food is good, but their customer service is awful! One of the men entered the wrong amount for my debit transaction for $250 & there was no consideration, just a statement that'll I'll have my money back in 2 weeks. No apology. We'll never go there again!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out from this place preparing for the big \"snow day\". Lol. I have to say this is the best Chinese take out I've had. Great prices, great portions and best of all- No MSG! Plus, when you spend $25 or more you get FREE crab rangoons!"}
{"text":"This is my usually go to spot for Chinese food, but not anymore. I ordered the burbon chicken with extra burbon sauce and I got home all the way on the other side of town only to find out my chicken was as dry as a towel out of the dryer. I blame myself for not checking in the box before I left, but I as I said this was my go to place and I never had any issues before so I never had any doubts. I called them up and I wanted was an acknowledgement that they messed up, nor did I want anything free. All they had to say well come back and we'll give you some sauce on the side or something, but instead they blamed me and said, \"Maybe you left it out too long.\" I replied that it was just 20 minutes ago. Then they hung on after I said I won't be come back to you ever again. It's sad because they lost a loyal customer that was willing to travel just for there food. Beware of the rudeness."}
{"text":"A nice place to eat when you don't have  to cook. They serve the entire wing.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Love the General Tso s chicken. Honestly I've never had anything bad from here. Very quick."}
{"text":"Just awful! Oil and blandness is all I can state. Rice tasted burnt. Needless to say we will never be back."}
{"text":"I don't normally do the bad reviews... but this place is the worse Chinese place I have ever had. Eggroll and sweet and sour chicken were extremely overdone in really old oil. And the veggie lomein tasted like cigarettes. The rice was good however. But that's about it. Makes us sad, we recently moved to the area and always looking for easy take out Chinese. Prob won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food for the most part, beef is often gristly and fatty so I just get other things and life is good. One caution, they use very inferior plastic containers so be careful transporting hot soup etc."}
{"text":"Best egg rolls ever!!! Food is cheap and portions are huge. My only complaint is the restaurant itself. They need some major renovations."}
{"text":"sesame chicken is good! general tso chicken is good. chinese doughnuts are good... the only gripe is that they dont deliver... and its not like there isnt demand.."}
