{"text":"Quality pizza! Relaxing sports beer bar too."}
{"text":"I only even gave 1 star because you need to give at least 1 star. The owner was rude and hung up on me after I called to complain that it was two hours after we ordered delivery on a Saturday night and he said -well the girl who took your order said you said you were coming to pick it up.  I never said that -we have a two-year-old and we were in our pajamas for the night Needless to say I called back later on after ordering delivery elsewhere, because he said he was charging my credit card regardless because he would reheat my pizza but not make a new one and I needed to pick up. I called him a douchebag (lol) he was very rude back and told me he did not care if my family and I ever ordered from him again -he said he was going to charge my credit card and it was on my end that this was the mistake - no it was the girl who answered your phone who made the mistake ---excuse me douche bag isn't the customer always right???Needless to say I will never order from them again. Plus they're closed half the time -they close early -what the hell is up with a pizzeria that closes at 9 o'clock on Saturday night -closed Monday's etc!  I'm from Long Island, New York I -know good pizza and there are so many other places in Lake Norman that are better than this crappy place. I ordered from them once a week, as well as big Italian family as well and I told the owner that and he said I don't care.  I just got off the phone with my credit card company and told them to cancel payment for this piece of crap place!  Believe me the owner is a true douche bag!  They suck!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Very quick service, and the pizza is YUMMY!  Our family goes there at least once/week for pizza.  We've also had their calzones and garlic knots, everything here is very tasty."}
{"text":"Wow great pizza just moved down from ny, white pizza is awsome"}
{"text":"Just ate here for lunch and I'm getting more and more mad as the day goes on - best way to get over that is to let others know about my experience!  Dropped by at opening time, another family was just behind us.  Everyone orders and sits down.  Their pizza comes out first and I thought it was strange, but was sure ours would be right behind.  About 5 minutes later, the waitress/counter person goes to their table, takes the pizza and brings it to ours.  She apologized and explained what happened - there were 2 pieces missing.  Then she goes back to their table and brings over 2 slices that have already been served and assures me again that \"they didn't touch them\".  I'm kind of in shock and look down at mine and the cheese is drizzled on top -  you know that first slice when the cheese is still really melted and makes a string and you pull it off then pop it on your piece?  Like that!  So I say \"no, these pieces HAVE been touched\".  She takes my one slice and goes back to replace it.  I put the other slice aside and told my kids not to eat it.  I wasn't very happy and didn't stand up for myself and should have.  Now that I think about it, I'm not sure how anyone can NOT touch a pizza slice during serving - I'm now absolutely disgusted that I didn't return the whole thing and just get a refund.  Going to call management on Monday and let them know what happened.  I can't imagine that this didn't violate food service rules!  So bottom line, what's happening behind the counter when this is happening in front of it?  Expensive pizza.  Needless to say, we won't be back and will be sharing our experience.  Hate to do this to a non-chain but this shouldn't be happening anywhere."}
{"text":"My family and I live close by and order to go occasionally because it is close and easy.  The pizza and wings are good.  At my most recent visit we ordered the special which was 2 large 1 topping pizzas for $23.99.  So I requested we get one with sausage and one half and half (mushrooms on 1/2 and pepperoni on 1/2) and the person on the phone said that was fine same price. When I picked it up they charged me an additional $2 for toppings after discussing this with the attendant they said that is the way it rings up in the system.  Offered to give me a dollar back.  After more conversation and trying to explain it should be $2 (and technically the tax on the $2) they said no it would only be one dollar.  They did agree you could do 1/2 and 1/2 so not sure why it would only be $1.  Should not be the customers fault for a system that can't ring the food up the correct way or for staff who can't help when the special rings up wrong. So looks like we will not be going back.  Gave it 3 stars because food is good but did not grade higher due to some inconsistencies with service in restaurant and on to go orders.  Review is more based on several visits not just the last."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on a Saturday night just before 7pm. Person on the other line was pleasant and informed us it would take 45 minutes. Starving, we ordered:

Garlic knots with marinara sauce $3.00
1 large salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing $5.99
1 large Veggie Delight pizza with pepperoni on half $18.25+ 
2 Cannolis $3.25 each

Fortunately for us, it arrived in under 45 minutes. I was so hungry that I started working on my second garlic knot before my SO could finish paying the delivery guy, who was also pleasant and friendly. It came with 6 knots. They were warm and had ample garlic flavor. We had already taken one slice of pizza each when I realized I forgot to take a picture for Yelp. Oh well. I have never had a veggie pizza with eggplant before. Although I am not a fan of eggplant, I think it's a nice addition. It also had a generous amount of black olives, green peppers, mushrooms, and onions as well as a decent amount of pepperoni on half. The pepperoni half was my half. I was pleased with the low salt and grease levels. Flavor was good, but not mind blowing. 

The salad was okay. It came with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, olives, onions, mozzarella cheese, and croutons. I think I'll try their Greek salad next time. The cannolis were big and drizzled with chocolate syrup. The person who took our order asked if we wanted chocolate syrup on top. Who would actually say no to that? They probably Hershey's chocolate syrup if I were to guess. Again, not mind blowing but was sweet enough to satisfy our sweet tooth.

Glad this place delivers. Prices are reasonable especially for the portions. I look forward to trying more items on the menu and stopping by one day."}
{"text":"Great pizza! One of the best I've ever had (outside of Bleecker street pizza in NYC or Home Slice in Austin). Great staff, always friendly, cozy atmosphere, worth your time to explore."}
{"text":"$4.99 Two slice + drink!!!  So worth it.  

This is a very hidden gem, located off Highway 73.  Well worth the trip.  This pizza is reminiscent of my days back in NYC.  Just terrific pizza."}
{"text":"Must try!!!!!!! By far the best pizza in the area! It's become a weekend staple for us. Just wished they delivered to our neighborhood"}
{"text":"Our family has been long-time customers, and have always enjoyed the pizza here. Thin crust, plenty of stringy cheese, fresh ingredients. We like a few others in the area (Due Amici, especially), but this place is closer, so we eat there more often. We ordered our usual, a large extra cheese and a large pepperoni pizza, got it home, and as soon as we opened it, we knew it was different. Upon tasting it, we could definitely tell something was off...the cheese, which is usually stringy, was scarcely on and tasted plastic-y. The crust was thicker than usual and too doughy. It certainly wasn't up to their usual standard.

I called to see what had changed...maybe their recipe was different or their cheese vendor? The phone call girl was nice enough and apologetic. She even offered me a free pizza for another time, until she asked my order and I told her I had two pizzas...she put me on hold and  talked to her manager. I wasn't looking for a free pizza, I was looking for someone to apologize for our subpar experience and possibly offer me an explanation because it wasn't normal.

The manager gets on the phone like a grenade about to go off. She is completely rude, defensive, telling me how their pizza is so wonderful and nothing is wrong with my pizza BEFORE I EVEN WAS ABLE TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS. She was completely horrible on the phone to me and when I asked to speak to the owner, she told me he was busy, pretended to take my name and number and told me he'd call me. Of course, he never called. 

My family will be buying our Friday night pizzas from ANY other place than this from now on. Bad pizza I can handle. Bad customer service, not so much."}
{"text":"I have been getting pizza from here for the better part of two years and love it.  The staff is fantastic and all know me by name.  The pizza is great, and as a native Long Islander, I think this is the best in the Charlotte area.  The crust is crispy and the sauce and cheese are great.  If you are looking for a good New York \"pie\", swing by and grab one, or hop in for lunch and get the two slice deal, can't beat it."}
{"text":"Ravioli, lasagne, meatball, garlic knots....all very good. Dining area needs an A/C upgrade.  Friendly crew.  Pleasant late lunch spot."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great pizza, excellent size and rarely disappoints. It is more expensive than the chain pizza places but the taste of their pizza makes it more than worth it. I highly recommend them!"}
{"text":"Very good and very consistent. More expensive than the chain pizza stores but worth it. We normally just get pizza (take-out) but have tried various sandwiches, pastas, salads and appetizers. I can't think of a thing we've been disappointed with except for a few burnt garlic knots once. They are our go-to restaurant when I don't feel like cooking but still want to eat at home, which is usually once a week."}
{"text":"The food was good, but both times we've picked up take out they have forgotten food in our order. The first time they forgot to give us a whole meal. The second time was an order of french fries. French Fries aren't usually a big deal but it is to a six year old. Next time, we'll check ALL the food before leaving and getting home to realize we don't have all of our food."}
{"text":"When we moved here  a year ago we asked a transplanted New Yorker to give us names of the best pizza around here, she gave us 3 names and one happened to be DiMaggio's. We tried it for our first time back in August 2014. We enjoyed it, It has been a long time since we had decent pizza after living in Arizona for 19 years!  Up until DiMaggios closed on Monday Nights I was having food delivered  every Monday so my son had dinner because I was not  home to cook for him. It was the perfect solution to making sure my son had a meal on Monday nights. The food always arrived hot and according to my son it was delicious. The delivery driver always arrived in the time they promised. The Pizza is good I have yet to have a bad Pizza Pie. One time my order had an error and I spoke with the manager. He fixed the problem, and had the new order delivered immediately. I happen to check my Credit Card Charges religiously and a few days later I noticed that he removed the charge completely so my order was absolutely free. I called him once I noticed that  thank him because he did not have to do that but that is what customer service is all about."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining here since this establishment changed owners and received a new name.  The food here is quite good.  My family and I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Completely rude employees and owner. Very inconsistent food/ingredients and they will screw up your order frequently. They screw up, they WILL NOT refund your money. Never seen this before EVER! Sometimes closer to the house isn't always better!"}
{"text":"Nope. Stopped in on my way home last night to pick up some garlic knots. Nothing crazy, first time trying it. They were tough and dry...complete opposite of what garlic knots should be. Probably won't be back to try the pizza...oh well."}
{"text":"First time ordering from here. Food was very good. Will order from there again but try a different pizza, looking forward to the grand ma"}
{"text":"DiMaggio's is our go to pizza place.  We get take out from them at least two times a month.  It's the closest thing to CT and NY pizza in the area.  We have tried Johnny Brusco's, Hawthorne's, Rosario's, Due Amici's and several others in the area.  DiMaggio's is by far the best and most consistent.  Their grandma pie is much better than Rosario's.  It is a little over priced, but all specialty pizza are.  The garlic, basil and crushed tomatoes combine for a perfect bite!  The red sauce for calzones and strombolis is perfectly balanced.  I love to dip my pizza into it.  My only real complaint about the place is that they use CANNED (sigh) mushrooms.  WHY WHY WHY?!?!?  Cost I'm sure, but it's sacrilegious to eat canned mushrooms on a pizza.  I wish Yelp allowed half stars as I think they are better than just a four star rating."}
{"text":"Stopped in DiMaggio's for a pizza.  First time.  The waitress was fast, efficient and helpful.  We ordered the \"Special\" and an appetizer of garlic cheese bread.  The garlic cheese bread came out quickly with a nice dish of warm marinara.  Although we decided it was not smart to order this particular appetizer with a large pie coming, it was in every way delicious and we recommend it.  The pie was great... loaded with goodies and well baked.  We took a few slices home for lunch the next day.  I think you will enjoy this one... A definite step above most chain pizza and a fresh lively atmosphere with flat screens on every wall for the sports fans."}
{"text":"This is the place for the BEST WINGS!! I just moved to Colorado and can't find anywhere in comparison here to DiMaggio's  wings and ranch!!"}
{"text":"I've had mixed results here...the pizza is pretty good, though overpriced (if you are ordering an entire pizza, not a lunch two slice special).  However, I had quite possibly one of the worst meals I've ever had in a restaurant last Friday.  I ordered the Baked Ziti with meat sauce and I am not exaggerating when I say that the plate arrived at our table and the ziti was literally floating in grease.  Orange grease was completely surrounding the entire perimeter of the plate.  I took two napkins and soaked up enough grease to completely cover the napkins.  I laid them on the table next to my barely touched food, assuming the waitress would notice, ask me how it was, etc.  However, she didn't bat en eye.  Even when she asked if I wanted a box and I chuckled and said \"no\" emphatically she didn't even question anything.  The serving size was huge and I probably had about 8 bites yet no question at all.  All I could taste was a combination of grease and mozzerella cheese (which when I pushed the huge globs of cheese with my fork more grease oozed up ).  It was the least appetizing thing I have ever seen.  

I am not one to complain in restaurants, mostly because I figure they'll just assume that I'm trying to get something for free.  So I didn't say anything, but immediately regretted it.  Hopefully the chef saw the full plate and the grease covered napkins and got the hint.  

Another minor complaint about the service--it was my 9 year old son and I eating and when we sat down she immediately brought over two soft drink plastic cups without even asking what we wanted to drink.  I know a lot of people have no problem giving their kids soda, but we don't often (especially at 7pm) and I couldn't believe that she would just make the assumption without asking.  Bottom line is, just ask what we want to drink."}
