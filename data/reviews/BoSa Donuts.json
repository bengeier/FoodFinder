{"text":"Last 2 times here were the worst. Hubby and I bought coffee one morning (one small, one medium). Had to repeat order multiple times at the drive thru, again multiple times at the window. Took a sip a few minutes later and it was a combination of burned, bitter, and sour. He got sick and threw up.

Thought it was a one time off day, came back another afternoon for 2 ice blended drinks (one with whip no boba, another boba no whip). Again, had to repeat order several times at drive through and again at window. Long wait at window and woman immediately closed it leaving the clipboard with me, knocked, no answer, honked, no answer, I finally opened the window myself and THEY were irritated that I was returning THEIR clipboard. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"I eat here all the time! The food is consistently great which is very important to me. I try to get something different every time. The place is always clean and they are renovating without letting it interrupt their business hours-which are so convenient, by the way! Can you really beat 24/7?? I've often witnessed the ladies working here deal with a lot of grief from some super rude people and they are always gracious about it, that being said, they're pretty sassy when I order because they recognize me and I take forever to order. You've got to try their sandwiches and tea 
Love this place, a staple for sure"}
{"text":"Went at 8 pm so can't say if the donuts would have been the freshest, but they were pretty good. Not the best I've ever had, but I'm still new to the area so maybe they are  good for around here. Upon entering there were two people on staff...one gave us a glare like oh great people. She shoved a donut in her mouth and continued whatever she was doing. The second employee walked over and was totally enthusiastic and pleasing. We ordered a dozen variety of donuts. I also got a mocha cappuccino. I was really  disappointed though, I thought it would be a real cappuccino, but it was just a flavored machine. It still tasted decent though. So the donuts were all pretty good...the chocolate Bavarian being my favorite filled. The donuts were light and airy inside and the frosting was just enough."}
{"text":"Willy Wonka has nothing over the amount of sugar Bosa Donuts delivers.  This is a diamond in the ruff, best donuts!"}
{"text":"Very nice staff good food for the prices, if your in the area grab a sweet treat or sandwich."}
{"text":"Best donuts in Arizona. The staff is nice sometimes. I guess serving all those donuts is hard work."}
{"text":"Theeeee best doughnut shop in Atizona. It's difficult to drive by this place in the morning, they open early.
Get there early enough to get the freshest. They do replenish the counter quickly. If you need a Sunday morning break, treat yourself to Bosa."}
{"text":"I found Bosa after an amazing meal at Becketts Table. I know, what the hell am I doing going across the street after a huge meal. Well, with experiences at great donut places in Texas, I have always wondered where the great donut place is for AZ.

Bosa Donuts is that place! They carry all the classic donuts and you won't be let down. These are not like the large chain donut places. Bosa donuts are always fresh, whether you are there at 6:00am or Midnight. Yes, I know. 

Bosa Donuts is THE Donut Place in PHX!"}
{"text":"I love donuts! With that said, I love Bosa donuts! The place isn't anything special but their donuts are are! I love that there is a good variety of donuts. I love french crullers and this place does my donut right! Another one I like, which is boring, but a good way to judge, is the sugar glazed donut. It's another favorite and can't go wrong. This donut, along with the other ones, are ones you can't go wrong with from Bosa. Aside from having awesome donuts, they're awesomely cheap! I can get a dozen donut holes for super cheap!"}
{"text":"My favorite favorite favorite donuts. And wonderful coffee. Super friendly staff. 

Donuts. Yum. Drool."}
{"text":"BoSa is the best donuts in the valley.  If you want a maple long john, you go to Bosa and you buy a maple long john.  The Boston cream and buttermilk are also f*****g fantastic.

I would tell you to be careful of the \"fancy donuts\" because they cost an extra 30 or so cents.  But if you care about 30 cents you shouldn't be buying donuts you should be buying rice in bulk and not spending the gas leaving the house because you're probably broke.  Buy the bearclaw and forget about the 30 cents, in 30 years you won't remember the 30 cents you'll remember the bearclaw because it's f*****g delicious."}
{"text":"I used to get a mocha frappe from MC D's til i heard bosa donuts had a really good mocha with boba. I honestly dont kno wat it is but is the best mocha frappe ive ever had along with the donutholes 

Really good taste n a good service but the only thing i dont like is dat the left overs are thrown away iheard employes kant take them wich is alrite but y dont they give them out to homeless people idefinitly kno iwouldnt mind goin aruond the valley making sumones day and getting a smile in return n thats worth more than money ibelieve."}
{"text":"2 stars because the young lady working was one of the most rude employees at a place of business I have ever encountered.  Honey if you don't wanna help people get out of the service industry....."}
{"text":"Donuts are soooo good. Service is great and you can get in an out quickly despite lots of customers. They always have a large variety of fresh donuts which makws it sooo hard to pick!"}
{"text":"Came here ordered two breakfasts sandwiches a large smoothie and some donut holes. When I heard the total ($12) I was shocked. Very affordable and great food."}
{"text":"I love Bosa donuts! They truly are the best in town, but I love this location the best. It family that owns it is always nice and very patient while we make our late night selections."}
{"text":"So far i have made two trips in on friday mornings and they have been top ranked in my opinion. Both times i was picking up for the workplace so a few dozen donuts and a few dozens of holes were a must. Both times the orders came to about 25 bucks, so much less than a dollar per donut average. Perfect price range unlike some of the pinkyup donut places that charge 4 bucks a pop.

My advice, double the hole order because they get gobbled up like hot cakes. The donut holes taste like mini crispy cremes and almost melt in your mouth.
The favorites from the office crowd are as follows: Apple Fritter, Old fashioned, Buttermilk, strawberry frosting and boston creme however there were never any left over so i think they all had a pretty decent rating.

Customer Service was fine, they were all friendly and i dont know how much the language barrier matters when you are just pointing at donuts but i had no problems. Overall i would say it is a great addition to 32nd St offerings.

They are now 24 hours so ignore this: Almost took off a star because this location is NOT 24 hours, they are 4-10 so i couldnt get a fritter (to go with my carne asada from next door) at 11pm but everyone needs to sleep i guess."}
{"text":"Delicious donuts! Kids loved it. Even gave us free samples."}
{"text":"Please put music in these stores it's dead quiet and I don't like it, otherwise this place has the best donuts in AZ"}
{"text":"great doughnuts and bagels, their costumer service could use some work but the doughnuts make up for it"}
{"text":"Welp, sorry to be the Negative Nancy amongst all these glowing reviews. It's kind of a problem with Yelp; lots of people say something's great and others just kinda go with that flow. Either that or they have no taste (hoping the prior; don't wanna seem too pretentious).

Anyway, the people who claimed these doughnuts are a step above Krispy Kreme or Dunkin Donuts are wrong. They aren't a step below, it's just that they almost taste *just* like Krispy Kreme doughnuts. I had a chocolate-filled glazed, a much-recommended (on here) buttermilk, and a chocolate iced chocolate cake doughnut. 

The verdict: The chocolate cream-filled was more of a chocolate jelly than chocolate cream. After a bite, it was clear for the trash bin. The other two were not so bad, but seriously tasted just like Krispy Kreme; the \"buttermilk\" is just a knock-off of KK's sour cream doughnut.

Anyway, pretty disappointed given the reviews here. I suppose I've never liked doughnuts, for as one reviewer put it they have a \"fast food feel\" after eating them from Dunkin' or KK; unfortunately, as copycats these have that same feeling."}
{"text":"Best donuts in town!! Donuts are big, fluffy and not too sugary. It seems like the other donut shops have gone too corporate- there's no feel to the other donut shops. Bosa offers both, a great donut and the feel of a real donut shop. Customer service has always been great when I go."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed coming to Bosa, but this past visit I encountered an extremely rude employee. She did not have any manners what so ever & as we paid at the drive-thru window she did not say one word to us just handed us our order & receipt. She was way to busy having a loud conversation with someone else inside of the store. HORRIBLE. I am giving five stars because I love Bosa's pastries & have had good visits here in the past, but this one employee was just incredibly rude & had absolutely no customer service."}
{"text":"Love their fresh donuts but they lack in customer service sometimes. It all fades away once you get the donuts in your mouth."}
{"text":"These are the best donuts I have ever experienced in Phoenix. They are very fresh and doughy (duh, I guess..) and come in many different varieties. The buttermilk donut was very unique, I would recommend it. The old fashioned donuts are also very good, although a little dry. In the end, my favorite is always the chocolate sprinkle donut!

They are open 24 hours (drive-thru) so it is kind of hit and miss with freshness- I think they make new batches as needed, so some donuts on display are fresh while others are not. The inside part is open until 10 pm (even on sundays!) so this is a good random late night escapade."}
{"text":"Friendly and quick service.   Tried the buttermilk donut.  It was very sweet and on the heavy side.  Great to dunk in coffee. The sugar twist was fresh and light.  Definitely a place I'd come back to."}
{"text":"How can anyone rate this 2 stars let alone 5? Walked in and the place was oozing with garbage! Look over the counter and there is dirt and grime everywhere. Lady had no clue how to do math helping us. I had a buy one get one free coupon for smoothies and she couldn't figure out how to deduct one smoothie and tried overcharging me 3 times before I had to tell her the total. The donut we tried was fine but the smoothie and cookie and cream iced drink was horrendous! I will never go back to this trash bucket."}
{"text":"Got a huge order with my family of 4, and everything was perfect! Only one worker and she managed to remember everything and make it to perfection. The donuts are delicious!"}
{"text":"Donuts get 5 stars as always but the Customer service receives no stars! The customer service was dam right comical that's how bad it was, they looked angry and did not make any effort to make you feel welcome or thankful for your business. If it wasn't for these amazing donuts I would not return due to the horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Donuts were much better than I was expecting. Also, like that they are open 24/7 as I leave for work around 5:30 in the morning. The location is nice and the staff are polite if not friendly. As others have said the coffee is overpriced for what you get, but it's better than trying to deal with Starbucks."}
{"text":"I don't even like donuts! 

These are so so so so good. They don't leave any kind of aftertaste and you can tell they are fried in fresh quality oil. 

Easy drive through. Probably a little too easy.

The thai bubble tea was way overly sweetened and I never finished mine. 

Now I like donuts.....

The struggle."}
{"text":"Happy that Bosa is now in Ahwatukee, too:) but the quality of the donuts do vary compared to the ones at other locations."}
{"text":"Very disappointed that they didn't have any doughnut holes or a selection of specialty doughnuts. The ladies that work there were very rude and not helpful at all. The lack of customer service is what brought the rating down to a one star."}
{"text":"The donuts are good. The drive-thru staff is not friendly at all. They kinda seem half awake and don't seem to really care. They also never give me napkins. I have to ask every time."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I moved to the area. And the food's been amazing. The first thing is that there's always a lot of people! Good for the business, and always, the donuts are always, always good. Never are they stale. EVER. I love coming here, and they always have donuts. They never run out."}
{"text":"Today the glazed vanilla creme filled had like 1/10th the creme. My adipocytes are crying."}
{"text":"I'll drive from NO. Cali to AZ just for these donuts!"}
{"text":"The reason for my low stars is to draw attention to the fact that this Bosa location has their large iced coffee priced at $3.98 cents. That's the same price Starbucks charges for a extra large cold brew coffee, which brews for 24 hours. 

Other Bosa locations charge $2.49 to $2.98 for their large iced coffee, which is reasonable. But when you're paying $4 for a iced coffee, you should be at Carrel Coffee, or Hazelrock, or even Starbucks. Not a donut shop where the iced coffee is churned out like a factory. I like Bosa, but in terms of coffee, it's bottom of the barrel in quality. They should be the cheapest ice coffee in town, not the most expensive."}
{"text":"Good donuts, period.  They have all of the classics and usual suspects plus some alternates for when you're feeling adventurous.  Case in point is the buttermilk donut; this ornate gem melts in your mouth.  The texture is the perfect mixture that I cannot even put into words, and the flavor is amazing.  

The standard frosted, sprinkled, filled, and maple bar characters are all here as well, and far better than the fast food feel that dd or kk will leave you with.  

The interior and staff is an odd mix, but they know how to do donuts right, so who am I to turn a brow?"}
{"text":"Outstanding donuts.  The regular donuts are much better than Dunkin or Krispy Kreme.  The cake donuts are about the same.  Definitely our new go-to donut place!"}
{"text":"I get the Boston Cream and it is the best donut I've ever had! Staff was so friendly! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Best donuts around and great prices! They have the most amazing donut holes and they are 99 cents a dozen! They only have glazed but they are soo good!  I recommend Bosa's to everyone!"}
{"text":"here at least once a month picking up a dozen donuts for my mom and brother. it's a nice way to bring something to someone you love and not break the bank. we usually get chocolate frosted, jelly (raspberry I think) and apple fritters. The apple fritters are a good excuse just to go there by themselves. Crispy. And they have smoothies with boba, the taro is my favorite, it is not too sweet. and their iced coffee isn't watered down like some iced coffees can be"}
{"text":"Great, fresh donuts. I got a maple long john, a coconut cream, and a plain glazed. I loved each one. I will definitely be back. The line was long (out the door) but it moved really fast. I sat outside and enjoyed my donuts as I read a book. I would give them five stars, but in good conscience I must reserve five stars for Donutsville at 83rd ave and beardsley. Those donuts will be tough to beat."}
{"text":"I just wanted to clear something up from the comments.  Yes, Bosa is 24/7, but there are good times to go and bad times to go.

The best time to go, in my opinion, is about 4 AM.  The doughnuts you get between 8 PM and 2 AM are in about the most cleared out condition they can be, with a lot of the big guys like Cinnamon Rolls and Bear Claws drying out in the later afternoon.  At 4 AM, the best stuff is rolling out of the fryers, the cherry glaze melting, the the doughnut holes crispy and chewy and almost hot, the box will actually steam some in the winter.

You still get the whole variety until 10 AM, and but after that it's a crap shoot that your favorites will be available.

The Boston Cream, Maple Long Johns and Cheery Sprinkles are the best for a sugar craving, and some of the larger doughnuts are great full morning meals."}
{"text":"I have been going here since I was a kid, best donuts ever! Crumb donut is amazing, but all of their donuts are good, they have donut holes, thai tea and coffee drinks. The same people have been working here for as long as I can remember."}
{"text":"Very good donuts...  Old fashion is excellent!  Cinnamon rolls are a great choice!  Chocolate iced raised very good as well!  But the French Crullers are not the best"}
{"text":"I have never even heard of BoSa....I received a coupon in the mail and thought I would stop by during my errands.  Bought 6 different varieties and a bag of donut holes.  Put the box on the counter and forgot about it...Went to try one later and there were bites left of each  LOL....My daughter and friends ate them and left me crumbs.   They said they were the best donuts they ever had!!  The crumbs were delicious and I shall return again."}
{"text":"I love their donuts and they are definitely five stars, but their coffee isn't great.  If they had better coffee this would be the best place!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm
these donuts are the best and you can't beat the price!!"}
{"text":"Went today for the first time. The place is very clean and organized. Staff is very friendly and were very attentive. They have a lot of donuts to choose from for a good price. Also kids drinks like chocolate, milk, oj, and Capri suns. We tried the glaze donut it was good! I recommend this place for some delicious donuts!!"}
{"text":"Love the selection and prices. Donuts are delicious and the Boba milk tea is a must. Try! !"}
{"text":"Bosa Donuts was an extraneous trip to put a small shop to the test of our high hopes. 

My fiancee and I love coconut, and we got a half dozen (for something between $5-6) just to get a good idea of the different types. We got one brown cake donut with chocolate frosting and coconut flakes on top. We got one brown cake donut with toasted coconut all over it and maybe other stuff. We got a chocolate bar, a maple bar, and a classic old-fashioned glazed donut. The last one we got was a crumb donut! 

The best was DEFINITELY the toasted coconut, followed by a tie between the other coconut and the crumb. The rest were really good versions of classic donuts. The dough is very unique here. It is not artificially soft like Dunkin Donuts. It is very textured and soft and homemade feeling. The donuts taste real, they taste balanced, and they taste awesome! They are not greasy at all, they have a perfect balance between moistness and dry. Also, these donuts have even more value because they are the biggest donuts I have received, at the same price as everywhere else other than the store.

The service wasn't a typical drive-thru, the guy there made me feel like a real person instead of a robot requiring artificial customer service input. In other words, he acted normal, and grateful, in a very simple way. That is how humans should be I feel, especially considering the awkwardness I feel when someone is being fake with me at the counter/drive-thru.

Anyway, these donuts are awesome. They are better than any other donuts I have had. The only place that comes close is a shop in San Diego that was also just as tiny and local called Sunny Donuts. Ironically they both have foreign people working there. Both seemingly Asian or Hawaiian.

My fiance and I were happy to not regret going somewhere new for once! :)

***I want to add that it was difficult to describe the cake donuts that we wanted because some of them are similar to each other. HOWEVER, the guy on the microphone was very helpful and coherent as to my details, and he got all of them 100% accurate! I was impressed! My fiance talked about maybe giving them letters or numbers for easy reference, but I have faith in that worker understanding over the intercom either way."}
{"text":"Had to have an apple fritter with some donut holes.  I was not disappointed and liked that they have a drive thru. I'll pick up a dozen to go next time!"}
{"text":"One word: Kolaches! It looks like they just started selling them recently. We've been searching the valley for these for years. I've heard of a few places in North Phx that make them, but we never make it out that way. Now they're 5 minutes from our house. Oh, and their donuts are pretty great, too. :)"}
{"text":"I cannot get past this place. Best Boston crème on the planet"}
{"text":"This is the only place I come to when I have a donut craving. Much better quality , taste and price than Krispy Kremes and Dunkin Donuts. They are always open, fully stocked and I have yet to have a bad experience of a stale donut. The ladies behind the counter are always nice, patient, and willing to answer questions. It also doesn't hurt that they have a fridge with a wide selection of breakfast/dairy beverages. I love these donuts because they taste great and the texture is even better. Its a great balance between the fluffy interior and subtle crunchy exterior."}
{"text":"We love Bosa! Far better than Dunkin' Donuts (who hasn't tasted fresh baked in years). 

Bosa has good prices and a great selection of yummy doughnuts and drinks including smoothies.

They even have a drive thru!"}
{"text":"Yum! Late night, delicious donuts! We loved the glazed and the old fashioned. And, they were a good price too. We will hopefully return!!"}
{"text":"After hearing about Bosa Donuts from friends, I decided to try them out on none other than National Doughnut Day! They seem to get a lot of orders from drive-thru customers, as all 3-4 employees were eagerly talking through headsets and preparing orders while I patiently waited at the counter for someone to notice me. When a woman finally asked if I had been helped (umm, no m'aam you're the first person to speak to me in the 5 minutes I've been standing here looking at you), I ordered a half-dozen donuts ($5+) and went on my merry way. While Chocolate Frosted with Sprinkles will always be my first choice in doughnuts, I must say that the toasted Coconut doughnut was my favorite from here! 

All in all, Glazed was fine (though lacking appearance points after getting all smooshed up while being put into the box), Cinnamon was good, they were out of Lemon-filled so I defaulted to Raspberry-filled which was better than I expected it to be, and I didn't care for the Maple Bar. I'm not dying to come back, as there are plenty of other doughnut shops I'd rather try instead, but if I were to find myself here again I'd definitely get more Coconut doughnuts."}
{"text":"I went to Dunkin Donuts one night and they had hardly any donuts made!! but Boso on the other hand had everything!!! I absolutely love this place, best donuts ever!"}
{"text":"The best Donuts in town!!! I usually get a bear claw and thai ice tea and I am set for the day. No other donuts compare. Yumtastic!"}
{"text":"Thai blended tea! Is a must have ALL of they're blended treats are a delight. Love the smell of the donuts, fresh and clean environment and amazing customer service. I love coming here with my family I feel safe un like the other Bosa donuts in Mesa.!"}
{"text":"Of course we had to find the Best Donut Shop as soon as we moved to Phoenix.  Was feeling apprehensive since my husband and I have been so spoiled with good donut shops in Chicago. Luckily Bosa easily won our donut-craving hearts. 

We first tried Bosa at our church because they catered the donuts in every Sunday. They are perfect! Anything you try: yeast, cake, filled will be delicious! They even have drive thru! Who knew, donut drive thru = genius.  

My husband now asks almost every night after dinner if we can go to Bosa. This will be a regular spot for us."}
{"text":"Best flippin glazed donuts on the planet and they are open 24hrs. Employees are gracious and always apologize if I have to wait more than 5 minutes in the drive thru line (cars in front of me). I would  have given them 5 stars but I went there on Tuesday because I received a mailer advertising $0.50 glazed donuts on Tuesdays. I was informed that I could only purchase one glazed donut at this price....what the heck?!  Mailer ad said nothing about limit of one $0.50 donut per person."}
{"text":"What the!?!

Every Sunday morning I get my husband a sugar donut on my way home from church and today I decided at the last moment to try Bosa donuts.  I knew they had a drive thru, but I wanted to see the donuts so I went inside.  Big mistake!!  I could have bought him one in the drive thru and kept myself working out 5 days a week.  Now it seems I am doomed to 7 days plus an extra jog or two.

Every donut looked so puffy and light.  I typically get filled donuts, but I saw the buttermilk bars and there was a massive tray of them.  As a child they were my favorite a local bakery, but since the bakery closed they have been dry everywhere else.  

They also had filled croissants and I decided to try a ham, cheese, and jalapeno one.  For my last move I added in a French Cruller as it looked so darn good.   Well the cruller was devoured on the drive home.  Best one i have ever had by a long shot.  It was so light and sweet.  I kept thinking save a bite for the husband, but it wasn't meant to be!

While handing my husband his sugar donut I feared squishing it as it was so light and airy.  My husband took one bite and the incredulous yum rang out.  He polished it off and proceeded to hone in on my buttermilk bar.  Well I am okay with sharing because frankly this is an artery killer breakfast.  It was an excellent buttermilk bar.  That rich interior that is darker with the sin of buttermilk was present and it was lovely.

Not done though I popped the croissant in the microwave for 15 seconds as the lady at the store recommended and then into the toaster oven for a moment.  Dang this is breakfast, lunch, or dinner food and so good.  The croissant was light, flaky, and buttery and the guts gooey and delicious.  I spared one bite for my husband who asked what else came in the croissants.  

In my mind i see the hours sign...5am-10pm and even worse it is near my office and my home.  Well I can only hope that if I eat too many I will get sick of it, because I am already planning another journey.  It would be cruel of me not to share these luscious donuts with everyone i know..."}
{"text":"They have the yummiest doughnuts ever. And they always have friendly, quick service and fresh doughnuts. Very happy to have them in our community."}
{"text":"Not just a treat for the taste buds, but also for the eyes. These are the best looking donuts around. The only drawback I can see is that there are so many tempting choices that I find myself staring at them with my mouth watering and my eyes glazed over. The smell alone as I walk in the door is enough to send me into blissful happiness."}
{"text":"Yes Finally A doughnut place that taste amazing. you get to choose what you wanna buy and its ready to eat if you're in a hurry for school or goin to work it's a quick breakfast to have. I think what I'm surprised about is you walk in they have a black leather couches inside their dining those are comfy seats and I don't read on their menu cuz I already know what am getting on the day I'm coming in. :) I always love their white creme Bavarian I wish they could make the custard though then I'd be super happy il give five star I asked the staff they say they don't make it oh well but it's alright anyways. Can't complain their doughnut is affordable and taste really delicious."}
{"text":"I live right across the street and love smelling the fresh scent of donuts early in the morning on Sunday! Really delicious doughnuts and an awesome variety"}
{"text":"The donuts here are amazing but the customer service is HORRIBLE! The lady working the drive thru at night has the worst attitude ever! She messed up our order after confirming it with me  before I paid. I would continue to come back if they hired a friendlier staff."}
{"text":"Favorite donuts by far in the whole state of Arizona. My favorite is the strawberry glazed! However, last time I was there a cop asked for my ID cuz he thought I was breaking curfew..."}
{"text":"24 hours is a joke at this location and the service is just as bad. They should change their name to \"We are out\". It really does not matter that we got a late night donut craving and headed about 25 miles out of our way late at night to fill that craving...what matters is getting our hearts set on certain flavors and more than 1/2 of the time we are barked at \"We are out\". Really? 24 hours and you are out of everything? Not even as much as an \"I am sorry, but we are out\" no just \"we are out\". Maybe keep the lobby open 24 hours so that when you are out of EVERYTHING customers can actually SEE that you are out and not waste their time hearing \"no\" that's a bad word in customer service, yes sometimes it is not possible to always say yes, but NO should not be the primary word in a business priding itself to be 24 hours. Can you imagine going to Wendys late at night and ordering a burger and being told \"We have no more meat in stock\"....well then what is the point of being 24 hours? I guess just to pay some pissed off cashier to do nothing, but get an attitude with her customers because they are sick of being told no.

Onto the donuts, they were very good and flaky! I think my fave one was the chocolate with sprinkles. The raspberry one was OK at best....The filling was what I did not care for at all, but the actual donut was good! My husband liked the glazed the best. We both went there with our hearts set on a certain flavor and of course both left without those since this 24 hour location decided that stocking up was not a crucial part of being a good 24 hour location. I guess it is good that what we did get we, for the most part, liked enough to say we would go back......but maybe to another location if we were in the area."}
{"text":"Oh my! So delicious and scrumptious! Just the perfect way to make a apple fritter! I will return( start my diet tomorrow......) smoothies are to die for. Dunkin donuts/krispie kreme have nothing on BOSA donuts:-)"}
{"text":"The donuts and breakfast sandwiches are really good, my kids love coming her after church or before school for a quick snack. I go for the muffins more often then the donuts, the cream cheese muffin is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with any of the donuts. I loved the glazed twists!!!"}
{"text":"They have the best doughnuts in Arizona.All of their shops serve the best doughnuts, tasty, fresh and fantastic...I crave them...ALOT!!! There is one thing I must tell people.The hidden jewel about Bosa is ...they have the best sandwiches too!!! I get the turkey on a croissant all the way, no mustard and my husband gets the roast beef on croissant with no jalapenos. It's the one place we can always agree on. We usually disagree when it comes to a place to eat on the days we are running errands.Thank you Bosa, you are the best!"}
{"text":"I wish I didn't love Bosa as much as I do. The Taro Boba Smoothie and the Apple fritter donut are my faves. The butterfly donut is HUGE so be warned!"}
{"text":"When I moved to Phoenix nearly three years ago, a friend of mine raved about the donuts here. She was so passionate about them that she brought two of them to my house one afternoon in a tupperware. I kid you not, my mind was blown. The raised donuts are SO WONDERFUL. It's everything I like in a donut. Big, soft, and tasty. Sprinkles... Yes. Just yes. This is a donut place I would take anyone to. I've had the pleasure of having their donut holes (glazed and chocolate), their buttermilk donuts (tasty warm!), and their super delectable sausage, egg, and cheese croissant... Their coffee... Their frozen vanilla drink... Never had a bad time. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great donuts!!! If you want to butter up your coworkers bring several Bosa donuts to them !!! So good ! They have a great variety . Small place . I wouldn't dine in. Just pick up and take out :) ."}
{"text":"Best donuts, hands down. We go to Bosa a few times a month (usually in the mornings) and have never been disappointed. We've even gone in the evenings, and although they were out of several kinds, they still had fresh donuts available. Nothing bad to say about this place!"}
{"text":"The buttermilk is by far the best of the offering. I would say they could do a better job of marketing this uniquely flavored and eye appealing gem as their signature donut. The chocolate and glazed are a bit generic but still good in terms of texture and flavor."}
{"text":"Wow!  This place rocks!  Donuts here are fresh and legit... Staff are friendly and helpful. Back to the donuts...the young lady recommended their signature  apple fritter and buttermilk donuts, both were heavenly!!! They have a wide selection of donuts as well as some speciality ones... I think a good way to judge a donut is to taste the original \" glazed donut\" and compare to other bakery's... Well Bosa's definitely beat any other glazed donuts in AZ... They were so plump and soft our family had fun trying to devour it!  They had a nice sugar glaze on them as well as a familiar yet unique taste of their own!  

Although we only tried half the donuts they offer they have a larger deli selection of meals to choose from as well as a full coffee and smoothie menu.... This place is a great place to stop if you want some great fresh donuts ( not the pre made and shipped kind)!"}
{"text":"Great doughnuts and pleasant service. Nice selection and hard to choose from them all but the buttermilk doughnuts and the apple fritters are to die for!"}
{"text":"Very similar to Dunkin Donuts.  The breakfast sandwich was good and the donut was good.  But it was just good. Average. The places itself was meh.  But the ladies behind the counter...they were so nice and everything was ready FAST.   It's because of them that I gave it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Food and prices are great, customer service experience can be a lot better then it is. At this time I am not sure I will be going back to Bosa Doughnuts because of the customer service."}
{"text":"Best donuts in Phoenix! Can't get this quality of donut anywhere else in town. Open 24 hours which is great for those late night cravings."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible. Barely anyone speaks English, so I always get the wrong change back, and no one knows how to properly take my order!!!! They need a new staff. The only reason I keep coming back is because it's so close to my house, but honestly the service I just received makes me never want to go back."}
{"text":"These donuts are great! I usually get the \"old fashioned\" and the buttermilk donuts. I hit the drive thru, come home, smash a donut with a cup of coffee. Hello."}
{"text":"Best donuts in town. Period. Buy a big box of donut holes (99 cents/dozen) and be a hero at your next work, community or school event."}
{"text":"Good donuts, but the worst service ever! Every time I go there which is a lot since I live down the street, they ALWAYS mess up my order either i was missing an item (and still payed for it) or they make me pay more money then I should. Last time my girlfriend and I went there to eat they charged us $24 for 2 breakfast sandwiches that cost maybe $4 each, I had to literally scream at the manager to get a refund (paid with card) and it wasn't even in full they only gave me $8 cash and free food then had the nerve to say never come back again. I will never give my money or support to this establishment again"}
{"text":"I am somewhat ecclectic in regards to my tastes. I like having a story about everything. Now enters Bo Sa donuts, my boyfriend and I stumbled on Bo Sa one Sunday morning after a long night of drinking. We stopped for our usual Filiberto's breakfast burrito and suddenly noticed the Bo Sa Donut Shop haunting us from the next street over. We stopped in to check the place out and we were completely surprised. It was small, quaint and reeked of donut glory. It also had the perfect mix of family, joy and happiness. Not to mention some incredible donuts. As long as we live around Bo Sa we won't be shopping at any Safeway Bakery or Fry's Bakery."}
{"text":"Bosa is the best place for donuts!!!!!! Passed by it one day and now hooked on it. Actually during my graduation they had Bosa donuts and they asked us to go get donuts. I did what an average American will do and took one. Later they asked if anyone wants seconds. So again like an average American I got another. Best place for donuts in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Yummmmm. This Bosa beats the rest of the Bosas around the valley. The donuts are moist, melt in your mouth deliciousness."}
{"text":"I guess I don't get it.  This place has cheap donuts with mildly unpleasant service that you could get anywhere.

The donuts are pretty good, but nothing that would warrant the 5 star reviews on here.

I only gave this place a chance because of the good reviews on Yelp.  Ultimately, Dunkin Donuts is closer to my house.  The bakery section at Fry's is closer to my house too.  Plus, donuts are bad for you.

So long, Bosa."}
{"text":"This place has the best dounts and that's the only reason I go there, because the customer service isn't that great!"}
{"text":"So delish! Every doughnut I have had has been absolutely amazing! My favorite is the chocolate glaze or the cinnamon cake"}
{"text":"These donuts are incredibly BOMB! I can care less if I get a smile in return because in the end donuts make me fat and happy"}
{"text":"The donuts here are amazing....so fresh and tender they melt in your mouth!  I love the Crumb Cake donut, the old fashioned and the buttermilk bars.  The buttermilk bars are literally 3 inches thick....the best I have ever had!  The only reason I am knocking off a star is because the last 2 times that I have been there, they have been out of at least one of the donuts I wanted....but other than that....they are my new preferred donut shop!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best donuts I have ever had. Glazed, Buttermilk, Twist, and oh those wonderful donut holes!! Bosa Donuts, we are friends for life."}
{"text":"Best donuts hands down! We go every Saturday before soccer with our boys. They are to die for- a must try."}
{"text":"Im in love with Bosa donuts. I recently moved to Arcadia and since I 've found Bosa  I have been back 3 times, in just over a week.  

 The donuts are some of the best I have ever had. The buttermilk bar is amazing, my favorite. With the crumb donuts in close second. They have everything from bear claws to cinnamon buns, and all the donuts are always fresh, I have never gotten 'old' donuts that taste like they have been on the shelf to long. They even serve lunch sandwiches which most people don't know.

I highly recommend going to this place, but don't plan on leaving with less than a dozen donuts. After you walk in and see them you wont be able to resist."}
{"text":"Bosa has become sort of a tradition for my husband and I before we head out on a road trip. We don't eat them any other time, but we always seem to end up here before taking off. I don't know if its because its early and we need the sugar to stay awake on the road, or if its something about doing something out of the ordinary. Either way, this is the place we come to grab a not so healthy pre road trip breakfast. This location is open 24 hours so if you were craving a doughnut at 3am you could come in and get one.

Usually we grab either a half or full dozen of the fresh doughnuts. I like the glazed kind the best, but the cake ones are good as well, just not my personal preference. My favorite flavors are the traditional glazed, twist glazed, lemon filled glazed, and the apple filled crumb covered ones. My husband is a fan of all of the chocolate kinds and usually gets the long johns and custard filled doughnuts. There are a bunch of other flavors if those don't happen to tickle your fancy.

As far as doughnuts go I would say these are pretty good. I like them better than Dunkin Doughnuts and places like Safeway and whatnot. They are pretty cheap, and you can also get a dozen doughnut holes for a buck. I would recommend you stop in and at least try one for yourself.

The only thing I would have to say about this place is the drive through is kind of annoying. It doesn't take very long to get in the store and get out with your goods, but people will still line up around the store for the drive through, which I think takes longer and blocks people from getting out of the parking lot. You are going to be eating a sugar covered dough ball. Just get out of your car and go in the store."}
{"text":"We used to have a Dunkin donuts near the house years ago and it closed. My son was a tad distraught that his \"favorite donut place\" was gone and we were on the hunt for a delicious donut. And then...the clouds parted...there it was...BOSA DONUTS . Best chocolate cake, apple fritters, cinnamon rolls and donut holes EVER.  Yes there are other donuts out there.....but we love our Bosa :)"}
{"text":"Definitly better than dunkin donuts and starbucks. Here at bosa they serve some preety good size breakfast bagels that you can get with egg cheese and your choice of bacon or sasage. For about $6 you can get a coffee and a breakfast sandwich that fills you up preety good!"}
{"text":"Best donuts ever...very friendly staff ... Always have fresh stuff highly recommend the donut holes"}
{"text":"we got an assorted dozen--all of them AMAZING--but the original glazed were my favorite :D our new saturday morning indulgence!"}
{"text":"Real friends show up with BOSA donuts when things are awry. Their boba tea is yummy but needs more ball choices."}
{"text":"Dare I say it... Better than Krispy Kreme! They have the fluffiest and freshest pastries. I'm so happy they've opened a Bosa in Ahwatukee."}
{"text":"This place has the best donuts and iced coffee in town. My favorite is the Boston cream. The breakfast sandwiches are great too. Always a 5 star experience."}
{"text":"I gotta say, I was really impressed with this place. It's a lot better than it looks in the pictures I saw of it prior, which is why I was in absolutely no rush to check it out before. But then I looked into it again randomly on here and noticed they were open 24 hours. Ok, that's pretty cool. Seeing that it was late at night and needing a break from studying for finals, I drove over and ordered a donut and tea and read for fun (yes despite school I can still manage to do that) there for half an hour. The place looks really neat. It's small, but not cramped, it's definitely cozy. The lady working there that night was funny, nice, and cool in a way that you'll just have to see for yourself perhaps if you decide to go then. It was really tranquil there and I definitely look forward to going back."}
{"text":"I keep going to this place thinking maybe its gotten better but it really hasn't. .Always out of the good ones and the doughnuts taste like nasty fry oil .The place feels and smells like years of grime..I recommend going west down a mile or so to Duncan doughnuts."}
{"text":"Love the Thai tea with boba 
Went recently and they added some new furniture and counters. Really looks great.
Great donuts too"}
{"text":"Their donuts are really good, so are their smoothies. It's honestly the only good donut place in phoenix/Scottsdale, but I dread going there because of the employees. They have zero customer service skills. I always feel like I'm putting them out. Awful way to do business. I wish there was a different 24-hour donut shop around town."}
{"text":"If you like roaches with your donuts Bosa is the place for you! I ordered a dozen glazed munchkins and after eating one I noticed a little brown thing on the next donut. After looking at it in a brighter light to my surprise it was a little roach in the glaze of the donut. I have noticed roaches at this place before but all outside near the window I order from. Never again will I go here. I'm so disgusted."}
{"text":"I haven't actually been to Bosa Donuts.  However, I work about a mile away and at least once a week someone brings some in.

Best donuts ever?  I think i'll agree."}
{"text":"The coffee isn't the best but the donuts are insanely good! Flakiness/fluffiness of Krispy creme but way thicker and more substantial."}
{"text":"These people are the kindest. Fresh donuts, yummy boba. I love their hours too. Everything about this place is awesome."}
{"text":"The Good first:

- Drive thru
-Inexpensive- ordered three plain toasted bagels with cream cheese, a apple fritter, pink                   
 sprinkled doughnut and a large coffee for about $10
-Quick Service
-Bagels were \"different',  but good
-Size of their coffee (read the bad)

The in-between
-Undecided on the apple fritter, I liked it, but my son thought the one's at DD had better flavor. 
-Attendant was nice but very soft spoken, it was somewhat difficult to hear her on the drive-
  thru speaker.
-the bagels don't taste or have the same mouth feel as a true bagel. I suspect they may be
 omitting the boiling step and simply baking the bagels. 

The Bad:
-Cappuccino, is not true cappuccino. It is flavored coffee or what ever that is; was queued into
  this when she asked what \"flavor\"
-Coffee is horrible- acidic, bitter and burnt tasting. :(
-They only have plain bagels
-Menu is difficult to read

Not likely to go back unless I am in the area and need to grab a quick morning bite."}
{"text":"Okay overall.

Service is slow during night.

Which it makes sense for a donut place.
(They gotta get ready for tomorrow.)

Even then beverage prep was quite slow enough.

Eh. I'd give 4 overall but because of it's the pricing. I'd say 3"}
{"text":"I've been to the locations in Chandler and Mesa and one word describes both locations: Fresh.  Their donuts are consistently soft and fresh."}
{"text":"This place has amazing donuts. And the owner is very kind. Besides being the only place we've found that makes coconut donuts the owner has told us if the sign is lit to come in even if it is past business hours and we can get donuts. Talk about awesome! This place never fails to cure even the worst sweet craving and their donuts are soft and warm. The owner has even made a coconut donut on the spot when they were out. This place has great donuts and the owner goes above and beyond to keep customers happy. Thank you for the amazing donuts and outstanding service."}
{"text":"Love this place...  live in Gilbert but, I have my husband to stop and pick up on his way home from work...  Best donuts around...  The kids love them and they are huge..  Couldn't ask for a better place to get your donut fix that's for sure...  GREAT SERVICE too...  Friendly workers...  A+++++++   all the way  :)"}
{"text":"There was a HAIR fried into a donut hole. When I called to see if they could deliver a replacement order, they said no. Very understandable so I asked for a refund. She said she wanted to see so I had to drive all the way back. Fine.
When I got there, I showed her the hair and she took it, didn't even look and violently throw it away asking well where's the box? I told her I didn't have the box of donuts because obviously I throw the rest of the donut holes away. She said then no refund. I was told to bring the donut hole with the hair back, which I did and instead of being rude to me they should have been sympathetic to the fact that A HAIR WAS FRIED INTO THE DONUT!!! And served with a side of extreme rudeness."}
{"text":"Great bacon, sausage, egg and cheese croissants, and love the buttermilk donuts. Definitely one of the best donut shops in the city."}
{"text":"Favorite donut joint in the Valley. If you're going to treat yourself to donuts, hit up this place. They go great with coffee and if you are feeling generous, your coworkers will love you for the day as well. Over indulgence and unavoidable sugar crash to follow, but once the sensation passes you'll go back for seconds."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate the Donuts vs. the Service independently.  The donuts are AWESOME!  The service leaves alot to be desired.  This morning I went in and purchased donuts to go.  When I asked for my receipt, the counter clerk went over and poured me a cup of coffee.  I was then told that I needed to pay for coffee.  After many exchanges between myself, the counter clerk and her manager, we finally agreed that I did not order coffee, did not want coffee and the manager was finally able to hand me a receipt for my donut purchase.  WOW!"}
{"text":"I think this is my first review here on Yelp. I never thought I would be on here in my life but their rude staff is what finally pushed me to grab a busniess card last time I went and recover my forgotten Yelp password.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with the food nor any drinks they sell. Everything tastes great.

The problem is their employee/s. I'm talking about the person over the counter that greets you and takes your money.

I only go at night with my friends and every time we order, the employee gives off this vibe almost like we are a bother just standing there ordering our usual boba drinks and occasionally  donuts, the look on her face confirms that awkward feel too. The faces she makes as we're ordering is almost like she's thinking \"get the fuck out of here\" \"why are you coming into the store\". that type of thing. For the most part, my friends and I try to ignore it and make our orders quick. The thing is that it happens every single time we go and there is no other place like this in our side of town. I just wish that somebody that really needed a job and showed pride in his/ her workplace took this person's place."}
{"text":"These are the best, most consistent donuts in the valley.  I was always a fan of the Chandler location, so I tried this location as soon as it opened.  I was pleased that the donuts were as fresh and as varied as the other location.

I don't care if people go to dunkin for the coffee..a donut shop is about the donuts, and I haven't yet had any donuts in the valley in the same league as BoSa."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious buttermilk donuts.  Perfect amount of glaze.  Quick service and reasonable prices.

We asked for a chocolate cake, expecting the chocolate cake donut with chocolate frosting, but received the buttermilk with chocolate frosting.  It was equally delicious and would have been an easy fix had we checked the box before paying.  No big, not worth a ding in the rating.

Delicious donuts and pleasant staff."}
{"text":"The best plain glazed donuts in town. They're better than Dunkin, Krispy Kreme, and Hurts Donut. They're just awesome."}
{"text":"Family run, consistantly good, convenient hours, and as affordable as it gets. What more could you want from a local donut haunt??"}
{"text":"Could you please make one close to queen creek. I love your products but they are far away and I can't eat them as often as I would like. YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY"}
{"text":"BEST donuts I've ever had! I used to be a Dunkin Donuts person, but since they're not made fresh on location anymore....eh...
I tried the coconut cream, the coconut raised and a glazed donut. Sooooo good and incredibly fresh! The people who work there are attentive and very nice. 
Highly recommend if you love donuts :-)"}
{"text":"Best doughnuts I've had in Phoenix and the iced blended mocha is my payday favorite! Big train!"}
{"text":"Amazing doughnuts and crescent Turkey/roastbeef sandwiches.   Good smoothies.    Drive thru is kinda annoying. They are like filibertos and refuse to give you a total before the window.  Which is kinda dumb.  But whatever.   They are always delicious and quick.
 I  Always get the cinnatwist doughnut or doughnut holes when feeling peckish.   Strawberry smoothie is awesome.  I've been to other bosas and this one is the best so far!"}
{"text":"One of the best donut shops in the valley. Excellent selection - double that of other locations. Easy access in and out. They also have a drive thru. The donuts are never greasy. The apple filled crumb was like having apple pie you eat with your hands."}
{"text":"Best donuts in the valley.

I like a variety of donuts (my favorites, though are raised sugar and raised glaze), and all the donuts here are great.  Never too heavy, always tasting fresh."}
{"text":"Holy crap! Old Fashioned Donut = Pure Joy! The donut holes are pretty awesome as well. So glad this place is right by my house. I am going to get so fat....."}
{"text":"Great donut shop, love the apple fritters and cake donuts. Busy drive thru on a sunday morning but well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Love Bosa!!! I used to pick up early morning donuts on weekends for my wife and daughter at the grocery store and would get mad at her when she didn't like them.  I thought she was being picky and spoiled.  After a few visits to Bosa I understand why she is hooked!  Their apple fritters are awesome!  No day old grocery donut can ever come close."}
{"text":"THE BEST donuts in the valley!! Every time I am in the area I need to stop at Bosa's! Delicious!"}
{"text":"AHH BEST DONUTS EVER!!!!!!!! Bosa is amazing, and anything you get there is fabulous. They have a drive through too!! It's awesome. Nothing bad to say about em!!!"}
{"text":"These have to be the rudest people I have ever met. I was taking donuts to a senior home and wanted some the glazed donuts dipped in chocolate and I told them I would pay extra and they all told me I had to wait and gave attitude. I was shocked what happened to being able to order what we want especially when we pay for it. This was a special request for a senior home. They had three workers there and it was not busy. They made me wait for at least 15 minutes then kept sighing after 15 minutes I left. This is absurd they have zero customer service."}
{"text":"Best Cake Donuts in AZ and I am a plain Cake Donut Connoisseur :) They're Taro Boba is pretty good, not as great as SNOW on Camelback Rd but Bosa is closer so it's better than nothing. They have a large selection of donuts for those with more of a sugar tooth than mine so definatley check them out."}
{"text":"Just like the box says best doughnut in town.  Can't stop thinking about the Apple Fritter I had.  Very friendly staff to top it off."}
{"text":"For a cheap donut, this place rocks! If you want a place to grab a donut on your way to work this place is awesome. Maple rings  chocolate glazed  bosa donuts"}
{"text":"Best doughnuts ever. Staff is friendly always very patient with my children when they can't decide. And the boba drinks are amazing! My kids love this place!"}
{"text":"Normally good 24 hour service, in a very clean and friendly establishment.

The reason I leave a low review is because we found a strange PIECE OF METAL in one of our smoothies, literally attached to the boba. That could've been a huge dental bill waiting to happen. Dangerous and disappointing. I included a coin for size reference. I work in a professional kitchen full time and can't even understand where a piece of a metal that big would even come from. Lucky the drink wasn't served to a child! Living nearby, I come here all the time. Maybe not so much anymore.. 

Also be wary of your drink sizes. I have had multiple incidents late at night where the employee thought we wouldn't notice her serving us small sizes when instead we clearly ordered larges. I'm never one to complain, but it seems like with this place it's always something. Just keep an eye out."}
{"text":"This place is dangerous (in a good way)! They have the best cake donuts in town.

I agree with others that sometimes there is inconsistency and I have gotten greasy donuts. But they are far fresher than any others I've had in the east valley metro area"}
{"text":"The place itself could use a bit of TLC. It's not horrendously grimy, but some cleaning and furniture replacement would help a bit. Also, the drive-thru box is hard to hear, so that could use a fix, as well.

That being said, I haven't had a problem at BoSa. The service is pretty nice, the donuts are yeasty and just sweet enough, and the bagels are bagels. Haven't had any of their non-case drinks, though, so I'll update once I get brave enough to do it."}
{"text":"Best donuts in the valley. They have boba. Open 24 hours a day. They have a drive through. Seriously what else do you need?"}
{"text":"One of the best donuts i've had in my life!  Apple fritter is to heavenly.  Addicting....check.  Fatening....check.  Isn't part of my Neanderthal diet....check."}
{"text":"I have been here at least 5-6 times. The food is what keeps me coming back. The donuts are probably the best I've ever had. But the service, my god. It's probably the worst service I've ever had. The only thing that keeps this place alive is the great food. EVERY time I've been in, same girls, same nasty scowls on their faces. They are rude and curt. EVERY time. After today's visit of yet again scowls and rude service, I don't think I'll be back for awhile."}
{"text":"Love the donuts here. But don't waste your money on their boba or smoothies. Both are made using fruit powders, not fresh fruit, and are disgusting. The boba in my \"boba\" tea tasted like rubber bands and were about as chewy as one."}
{"text":"Very good smoothies and one of my favorite donut places.not very friendly service .Very quick and good .has many choices.i suggest it"}
{"text":"Best donuts in town.  All of the donuts are consistently soft and fresh unlike most chain stores."}
{"text":"Donuts were very good and the price for a dozen was not bad at all. We went to Bosas at the end of the night and the lady working was very friendly and patient while the kids picked out which donuts they wanted. Will be going back for more donuts in the future!"}
{"text":"I have had their donuts a few times and I am impressed. I think its pretty hard to mess up a donut, but to make it outshine the rest, that is amazing. I have had their maple, crumble, cinnamon buns, and  a simple glaze. I would pick this place, hands down, over Krispy Kreme. I am not a coffee drinker, so I can't tell you how their coffee is. Just make sure you ASK for napkins. They are always hidden."}
{"text":"Bosa prices for a dozen are so much cheaper than dunkin doughnuts. The best part is the last few times I went in
For either a dozen or even a half dozen they gave at least 3 or 4 more than what I asked or paid for. I like bosa over the chain of dunkin. Dunkin used to be great but now that they have reemerge they  rarely have a decent selection of doughnuts at all. I'm
Thru with dunkin and will always give my business to bosa"}
{"text":"All I can say is yummm!  They make the best old fashioned donuts!  I am a sucker for a good donut and wouldn't bother with the corporate chains.... if you're going to eat a donut eat your donut here!  (or at rainbow donuts if you're up north)  The only thing that would make this place and rainbow better is if they had an espresso machine....   do yourself a favor and go get yourself a donut now!"}
{"text":"The food is nothing fancy but the donuts are good.  However, their service and Boba drinks are well below par. The first time I went they got my order wrong: whip on the drinks, microwaved boba,  and I had to remind them twice to give us the donut my son ordered although they were glad to take my pament for it.

I was in the area and decided to give them another chance. The donuts really are good and my dad wanted one and coffee. Here is where the game changed lol. 

I ordered the coffee and apple fritter for my father. Then, a Thai Iced Tea smoothie with boba. Out came the microwave bowl, ugh. Maybe that's just how some places do it, but it does affect the taste. We recieved our items and my dad liked the coffee and loved the donut. My drink tasted like it had absolutely no sugar in it. I told the employee, very nicely, my issue. She had a blank look. Okay.... I repeated myself and then asked for it to either be remade or I would gladly take another flavor. She looked around for someone and another employee told me that that's the way they taste and if I wanted it sweet I should have gotten the drink just iced, not a smoothie. 

 Um, no. 

I informed her that I had this drink before and it was sweeter than the one I had now. She began looking around for someone else. I repeated all I wanted was for it to be remade or another flavor. She didnt want to, so I told her either remake it or I want my money back.

That was the attention getter, because the manager flew out from the back to tell me I was in NO WAY getting my money back. 

WOW! 

Okay, all I want is it remade or another flavor. The manager told me again and I again I wansn't getting my money back (okay, already). I said I wanted it remade. She told me it wasnt sweet and I had the plain iced last time. I never met her before in my life and I think I know what I've had. I've had Thai Iced Teas from Bosa and other establishments, always sweet. 

She was annoyed that I wouldnt agree with her. I repeated over and over, I wansnt going to argue. Now I was angry. I did want my money back, which she said she would never do. She said she would make it again but I was wrong. Really?! Shouldn't I get what I ordered? What I PAID for? Shouldn't I be able to expect the same product from visit to visit?

All 3 of the employees tasted the mix that was left from making my drink and none of them said it was sweet. 

Someone finally remade it. Miraculously, it was sweet. 

I will not be going here again. I will not be made to argue over something in which I have given you money."}

{"text":"I unfortunately had the worst customer service experience here. She was rude, pushy, and ruined my whole donut experience. So very disappointed."}
{"text":"Soooooo good. Dunkin is complete garbage compared to bosa!  I would eat these everyday but sadly I'm on a diet."}
{"text":"The donuts are the best I've had in the valley. The iced coffee I really enjoy, and for 2 bucks you can't beat it. I made a mess in my car eating the crumble donut one morning, but it was so good I didn't regret it. I had a croissant filled with ham and cheese last time I went that was delicious.
I give this place 5 stars for a few reasons. My father is a true doughnut connoisseur. He came to visit me, and after I took him there once, he demanded to go there everyday on his trip and proclaimed, 'you just can't get a donut this good anymore'.
The other reason is value, you can eat a donut and coffee for a couple dollars. In a world where Starbucks will charge you $5 for a mediocre latte, I'll take Bosa over them anyday."}
{"text":"This is a great place. The treats here are delicious and the sandwiches are yummy too! The prices are right too. Like I said, just a great place all around. They are even open late, convenient for just about any time. Sometimes the service can take a little time through the drive thru during the afternoon but there's usually only one person working and they can only do so much at a time. They are always very nice, good attitude, and are definitely worth the wait. I love donuts, period. But the bagels here are really good too. If you get a sandwich try it on a bagel, it's soo good."}
{"text":"Best buttermilk bars I've ever had! I ordered an iced coffee as well and it was awesome to. Will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My heart is now filled with joy and happiness. What for, you may ask. Since moving out to AZ last year from Southern California (don't say Cali, that's in Colombia) I haven't been able to find a donut shop unless you want to call Basha's a donut shop. 
While driving down Arizona Ave one morning, the familiar smell of sugary goodness wafted into the open window of my car. DONUTS! Pulled a U-turn and wept with joy. All the familiar offerings were there. The apple fritters and cinnamon rolls the size of man hole covers, chocolate long johns, even the plain raised cake. I ordred an apple fritter and a raised cake. Absolutely, positively heaven in a little, white greasy bag!
Go early because they only make so many of the bigger apple fritters and cinnamon rolls. The only \"complaint\" is that the coffee is nothing more than hot water with a brown crayon dipped in it to give it that coffee color. More cowbell!"}
{"text":"This is the best Bosa in the Valley. It's clean, updated, spacious and inviting. (The other locations I've been to over the past 15 years have always been a little dingy.)  The donuts are super fresh, day and night, and the service is likety-split fast. Try the Chocolate Devils Food or the Boston Cream...both are melt-in- your-mouth, slap-yo-momma good! Mmmm"}
{"text":"I love bosa so much this is the best doughnut chain in the valley. The buttermilk doughnuts are so hot they have a moist center and a crunchy outside. I really enjoy the maple ones as well. The mango smoothies are really good as well."}
{"text":"I stop  and go through their drive thru on my way to work. Large ice coffee is my favorite!  When I have time i  stop and go inside. I don't even make it to the front doors before the smell of fresh baked donuts begin teasing my senses. Once inside the thought of ice coffee becomes secondary as I browse the display case. So much to choose from. I pick out two Boston Creme and/or an Apple Fritter. Awesome! Ice coffee and I'm ready to go.  Seating is available and WIFi both a plus."}
{"text":"Boss has my favorite donuts in Phoenix! They are always really friendly, have excellent, fresh donuts and coffee, and at the same or better prices than their competition. If you haven't been, go now!!!"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Bosa Donuts but this location is different. They should change the name to shitty fritters."}
{"text":"First time at Bosa today and loved it! I only had the apple fritter, but it was so delicious. It was light and fluffy with just the right amount of crispness around the edges. All too often I find donuts have a horrible after taste, like the oil they use is old.....but there was no horrible aftertaste. So I'm not sure what others are talking about. 
My daughter had a boba taro tea and really enjoyed it. 

I will definitely be back to try other donuts!"}
{"text":"Gotta love Bosa! They have amazing fresh donuts, great coffee, and a big selection available. Plus, this location has a drive thru available so you can get in and out fast!"}
{"text":"Went to the one in tempe and i loved that it was open so late and had boba! The only thing is i felt the donuts we're kind of plain flavors no boston creme or maple and no sprinkles on anything maybe just how late we came not sure. Also wish they had more drink flavors for the boba and the boba had no flavor at all they need to soak it in brown sugar syrup water!"}
{"text":"While it's rare to get a bad tasting donut, it's very easy to fall victim to the too greasy, stomach ache inducing donut.  The donuts at Bosa Donuts are THE BEST I've had in a really long time.  They're satisfying without being too greasy or heavy.  I wasn't even bothered that the selection was a bit limited when I went in at 8:40 pm.   Service was very friendly.  The interior is also really nice looking and looks more like a cafe than the typical donut shop.  The bathrooms were super clean as were the tables."}
{"text":"Every donut I've had from bosa is absolutely delicious, but my favorite is the old fashioned sour cream donut. So perfectly crisp, sweet and savory and gone too fast. The fact that they are pure enablers open 24/7 just means that I can get a donut and boba tea on my way home, no matter the hour. Hooray!"}
{"text":"These donuts are an absolute delight! We came in the later afternoon and the donuts were still definitely fresh tasting. The only complaint we had was that the clerk wasn't very good at answering our questions, but we figured it out on our own. :)"}
{"text":"These are the finest bits of deliciousness in the whole hole donut land of Phoenixtown! The plain old fashioned are amazing and only get more delicious from there. Way better than grocery store donuts, megachain donuts and way way better than ripoff gentrifying donut upstarts. I also pretty much hear people's thoughts and exhibit other superpowers when I drink their iced coffee. Beyond the deliciousness, their prices are best for non grocery. Eat some! Drink coffee! Have superpowers!!"}
{"text":"Great Donuts!  Have a coupon where u get 6 free if you order a dozen, so look for that.  The buttermilk glazed is by far the best donut Ive ever had, bar none.  Warm it up for about 12 seconds and get a big cold glass of milk and thank me later....peace."}
{"text":"You ever buy donuts and eat one or two when they're still fresh, then go back 6 hours later for another one? Not as good, right? That's not the case here! The first time I had their donuts, a coworker had brought some in. Had one first thing in the morning and it was delicious, still warm and fresh. But what really blew me away was when I went back for a little late afternoon snack and those donuts were still great. They hadn't gone all stale and gross, still tasted amazing. Five stars, all the way."}
{"text":"My most favorite donut joint in Phoenix... err... Make it the US ... Seriously people I wonder what's keeping yucky dunkin donuts in business beside my colleagues walking there every Friday to eat those puke worthy treats ....  If you have got to put so many calories in your body better make them worth their while!!!! Bosa is most definitely the BEST!!!"}
{"text":"Great donuts and great service.  We have been here a few times and it is always good.  But this last time we stopped by the drive thru and asked if they had any Boston Creme donuts - because donut shops often run out of these.  Well, they were all out, BUT, the guy said he can just pump some Boston Creme into a chocolate covered bar (long john) and Voila!, we were in business.  Tasted just like a Boston Creme donut and NOBODY has ever offered this option at any place when they were out of Boston Creme!  This made the whole experience perfect.  Thank you!  Oh, and the other donuts were great - Glazed, Glazed Twists, and Chocolate Raised."}
{"text":"Best dang donuts in the valley. Courteous staff.  Highly recommended.  I also enjoy their coffee and their breakfast sandwiches are awesome."}
{"text":"Rude service- I ordered ice coffee by drive thru and I didn't catch her question if I wanted sugar and cream and I only caught her asking sugar. So I said yes sugar. When I got my coffee I realized that I didn't ask for creamer so I asked if she can add creamer. She literally raised her tone and said \" you sad you only want sugar\". I told her I'm sorry I forgot to ask but she didn't even let me finish and turned and added creamer. When she gave it to me the coffee was overtopped and spilled all over car seat and my jeans ....."}
{"text":"My all time favorite donuts anywhere in the USA. I don't go anywhere else and anyone who comes to Phoenix looking for a good doughnut shop and good coffee I send them to Bosa.  They are fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"favorite donut shop! My favorite would be the maple long John and they're always so freash. Best donuts I've ever had."}
{"text":"Too much grease...greasy donuts. And I love croissant but they were terrible...not even mediocre. Must be make with lard or something of that nature. But my husband likes the breakfast egg sandwich...which is OK."}
{"text":"THE BEST DONUTS IN CHANDLER!! If you've never had a Bosa donut, you have no idea what you're missing! I refuse to eat any donut that's not a Bosa. Any flavor you get tastes amazing! Plus, there is a drive thru, so it's Sunday morning and you don't want to get out of your PJ's? No problem! Just go thru the drive thru! Amazing  every time! Stop by and try one today!"}
{"text":"Dear Reviewers,
I really like these small donut shops but here I had a very bad experience. First I came in around 7pm not very busy only 3 people in line. There was 2 workers at that time and they seemed stressed out 1 of the 2 kept yelling at the younger lady to repeat her order at least 3 times. Then they accuse me of skipping the line I told them I was in no rush just waiting till everyone got there orders then I'll order. The workers were running back and forth between the counter and back area. Finally when I got my drink the price on the wall said 3.09$ for the size and boba I got which my drink was very runny not even nicely done just thrown together. Then I ordered a dozen donut holes which was 99 cents. My total came out to 5.41$ I was confused at first because even added together with standard tax of 10 percent should've came to 4.48$ but where is this extra charge coming from? It was almost a dollar more. And they hand type everything in so you can't tell what they wrote down. Basically I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Their filled donuts are not very good.

Everything else is fantastic.  My friends and I got a random dozen here at 3:30am on a Sunday morning.  Even at this late hour the donuts were so fresh and amazing.  And this place is in walking distance!"}
{"text":"I decided to make a croquembouche out of donut holes for a get together. I stopped by Bosa on 32nd Street and let the manager, Richard, know how many donut holes I needed and he had them ready and waiting for me the next morning. Not only were they delicious but they looked beautiful and were easy to work with and SO affordable! Thank you Bosa!"}
{"text":"I saw the Dunkin thread and felt I had to do a review for my favorite donut place.

I was introduced to Bosa by my church.  They have a Cafe between services and when they made the switch to Bosa, I noticed a big difference in quality and taste from the previous supplier.  The texture and creaminess of a simple glazed is similar to a Krispy Kreme.  The fritters are excellent and I like their bagels.

If I am going to pick up donuts to bring into work, I make a stop at Bosa.  To me, Dunkin is not as good as Bosa.  

Bosa is unique to Chandler and we are lucky to have them."}
{"text":"Half a dozen donuts for under 5 bucks? I get bring breakfast for my coworkers and it's not a fortune!! 

After reading the review at Bosa's, i decided to try it out myself. 
They are pretty busy in the mornings but it is not a long wait because they have around 5 workers. Donut holes are very cheap and I usually get a dozen donut holes and two donuts for my coworkers. They are open 24/7 and are constantly making new donuts. 
Today I've decided to try their smoothie with bona. Ohmygoodness! It was so good; definitely the best watermelon boba drink i've ever tried. BTW, they have a drive thru."}
{"text":"Have you tried a donut from here? Cheap and delicious. I had a watermelon boba from a boss in Phoenix and it was so much better than the experience I had at this location. I don't recommend it. 
You can get a dozen donut holes for a dollar. Great deal."}
{"text":"This review is for the donuts only since that's the only thing I order here.

I got a half dozen the other day, and the aroma from the bag was heavenly! The maple long john and chocolate cake donut were my favorite, but they were all outstanding.

Price, service, and convenience all met my expectations. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"In a world where trendy (ie overpriced) donuts are becoming a thing I'm grateful for Bosa. The donuts are delicious, they have locations all over the valley, and the one by my house is open 24 hours a day. I'll never buy donuts at the grocery store or Dunkin again as long as Bosa exists.

Be forewarned, this isn't a place you go for a fancy donut experience, this is where you go to pick up a dozen delicious donuts to bring to work. The interior is very basic but the display case is always full of donuts (even in the evening) and they're $1 each when you buy them individually. My favorites are the maple bar and their buttermilk donut (which is apparently on some list of best donuts in America). 

The coffee is nothing to write home about but they have a large menu of smoothies and other drinks that I've been meaning to try.

I'm always happy to support a locally owned company!"}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out because I was craving a Smoothie with boba. Unfortunately, this place is probably only good for their donuts. I decided to go with their mango smoothie(there was nothing smooth about it) and I added boba. My BF went with the Thai iced tea with Boba. The whole time the cashier was just staring at us with a blank stare as we placed our order, then had to have us repeat it a couple of times because he clearly wasn't paying attention. Then come to find out he charged us for two smoothies instead of the Thai iced tea which is cheaper. He then said it was ok as if overcharging us was doing us any favors. My mango smoothie tasted like mango flavored ice chunks. There was nothing smooth about it at all. The boba was the worst part. I've had boba more times than I can count and it's not ever supposed to be hard and crunchy. After two sips I tossed the \"smoothie\" and left. My BF's tea was good but he had to spit out the boba as he drank, which hit the floor like hard pellets. This place may be good for donuts, but that's about it. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Every time I go home to Phoenix, Bosa is the one place I HAVE to go to. It's been around forever but I have to admit I didn't first try it until a few years ago. I was doing a rotation with the fire department and after fighting a fire they stopped there for donuts on the way to the station... life changing. 

I promptly introduced my family to it and now it has become a tradition to go there with my family and the dog when we come home. My favorites are the classics like the old fashioned cake donuts. They also have great coffees and iced beverages. You cannot beat the price.

And don't worry.. you won't miss it driving past... it smells delicious even from the street!!"}
{"text":"Beware...Last Friday I bought donuts and the receipt automatically pops up with generic tipping options. I did not leave a tip and when it showed up on my credit card statement it showed that the staff had given themselves an $8 tip. I went into the store to complain and they did credit my card back the $8 dollar tip but they didn't seem to care at all that this had happened. Save your receipts if you shop here!"}
{"text":"They are so pleasant here. The donuts here seem better than my regular location and they make them multuple times through the day. I love the guy and girl who work here they are so friendly with beautiful smiles and a laugh. My mother in law had me get a half dozen to take with on a flight to chicago. Go early or u might miss out on the tasty apple fritter or perfect buttermilk!"}
{"text":"the old fashioned buttermilk were fantastic as usual.  i like that they often have 2 people working so you rarely have to wait.  plenty of seating and outdoor seating too. i notice this bosa makes their donuts a bit lighter than other locations so its a softer bite but still delicious"}
{"text":"Bosa Donuts puts the  \"D'oh!\" in DONUTS!
\"AHHH. Donuts. . . What can't they do!\"
Homer Simpson

Now that we got the Homer Simpson quotes out of the way, seriously; this place can turn you into HOMER SIMPSON!

When my buddy was telling me how he was addicted to this donut & I had to just try them! My reaction was \"OK Homer they are just donuts!\" & \"You can't do much better than Krispy Kreme in Phoenix!\"  
Plus; 
\"Donuts? I told you I don't like ethnic food!\" (Montgomery Burns)

He literally made me get in the car and drove to this place!

The look of disappointment just covered his face when the gal announced; They were out of the one particular one he had his mind set on!
So a week later he made it a point that we go back to this place...
Again middle of the afternoon and they were out of the \"Chocolate Wheeler!\"
So the following week mid morning we went by this place.
Again they were out!

By this point I'm thinking maybe the fact these suckers are like 85cents maybe they are good and they make a dozen or two & sell out!

The next day, after finishing a 3 set Tennis Match, in the parking lot in front of the Tennis courts I ask him so where are you going for breakfast! 
He just smiles reaches into the back of his SUV and pulls out a pink cake box, and opens the box! 

There are a dozen of these bad boys in the box! 
\"Aye Carumba!\" (Bart Simpson)

So with a \"REALLY! you bought a whole \"F\"ing dozen look on my face\" I reach in and pull one of these Famous Wheelers out!
I examine it visually; it looks no more special than any other donut! 

So as I sink my teeth into it I have to say; 
\"OMG!\" & I mean \"OH MY GOD!\"

I think I just had a FOODGASM! (yes it's a real word, you can Google it!) 
And I'm sporting wood just thinking about that moment!!!

I KNOW, I know, you must be thinking this guy must think he is writing \"DEAR PENTHOUSE...!\" But you know how when you fall in love with that one girl that pales all other relationships before & after her? 
Well to quote another fictional character this donut is \"Simply Scrumdiddlyumptious!\"  
To find out what this means I guess you have to get to Bosa Donuts before me & all the other \"Homers\" & spend 85cents!)

In comparison Krispy Kreme pales to Bosa Donuts! 

WARNING: You can't have just one!"}
{"text":"This place has everything you could want and more. Their doughnuts are the best I've ever had, their coffee is delicious, and their service is superb."}
{"text":"Probably our favorite donut place while visiting Phoenix. Fresh, filling and inexpensive... the whole family was happy!"}
{"text":"I recommend the Boston Cream Pie, jelly filled, or glazed. This place is the best donut shop in Phoenix hands down!"}
{"text":"I ordered 3 large donuts stacked in lieu of a cake for my sons 7th birthday. Showed the owner, Pong, a photo and he said it was no problem. Showed up on the way to my sons party to pick it up and it looked like a pile of wet slop. They presented it to us and said \"is this ok?\".. um, no. It's not ok. Not even close. He owner then told
Me he'd never made one like before and \"it just didn't work\". This info would've been helpful in the beginning. Or at least a phone call earlier that morning to tell me what happen. We got nothing. Pong seemed totally indifferent to the fact that we weren't going to have a cake for my sons party. He offered to give us the jacked up donut for free. We declined. He did offer us a whopping 20% off on the other 2 dozen regular donuts we'd ordered and he gave us a black coffee at no charge. What a guy. 
The ladies at Bosa are always friendly and helpful but the owner is clueless when it comes to customer service."}
{"text":"Never fails to hit the spot, super clean all the time and the employees are always friendly."}
{"text":"My co-worker loves this donut shop and bought me a donut one day and brought it to work. This is now the only donut shop I go to in AZ. They are cheap and friendly service. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Available 24/7, best fresh cooked donuts, excellent customer service, super nice staff, very clean place. Scale of 1-10, I give them 9. Only thing missing is more varieties of donuts.
This always will be my #1 go to donut shop."}
{"text":"My partner and I gave this location a call on the 26th, making an order for a freshly made dozen pink glazed donuts with rainbow sprinkles  to be made ready and be picked up on the 27th that next following day at 12pm for our son's 4th birthday party at the park across the street. We showed up on time,  only to be told that no one wrote down our order from our confirmed phone call. Very unapologetic and no one acted on making a report on who was responsible as they don't seem to give their name on the phone. They scramble and put what i could only imagine a batch they were  preparing to throw away. The frosting had no shine to indicate freshness,  they were translucent and there were massive fingerprints surrounding ever single donut. I will no longer be bringing my business or cliets here until the employees receive some much needed coaching for their poor customer service and inability to rectify the issue. Picture posted to show the fingerprints"}
{"text":"The best darn Boston Cream donuts! Great service, clean and fast. Prices are so much better than DD."}
{"text":"We have been here countless times and they are always great! Not all Bosa's are the same in quality, we drive a farther distance to get to this one. The best donuts are the strawberry frosted, the buttermilk, and the apple fritter."}
{"text":"Consistent,  yummy, drive-thru, coupons! Really, this is all I need to know! They have all my favorite, old-school donuts!! Chocolate long john's, Chocolate cake with chocolate frosting, custard filed chocolate frosted, apple fritter and then get have many, many more. They have all kinds of drinks and breakfast sandwiches too, in case you want to be semi-healthy!

On the North side if Indian school. You can go in, but I just hit the drive-thru. 

The coupons come to the house for half dozen free with a dozen. They are already s better deal than most places and taste better!!

Dang, now I'm craving a donut!"}
{"text":"We pulled over just to find this place. My fair has been restored in Yelp for one more day! Oooo mmmm hhhhhh. Omg for those English speakers. They dissolved in our mouths those little manna  donuts holes from heaven. The were not too sweet."}
{"text":"Great staff, quick and courteous. Donuts and breakfast items are always delicious. Restaurant is great for quick meetings and they are always cleaning."}
{"text":"Bosa. The name alone makes hungry employees excited. Seriously, I've never been disappointed with their donuts. They are pillowy soft and super fluffy. The glaze is just the right amount of sweet, and the employees are friendly. It's well known around my donut loving office. 

They are not crazy expensive, and they have tasty beverages as well. 

I'd definitely recommend their croissants. 

Forget all other donut places. Bosa is it. You're welcome."}
{"text":"I've been to several bosas' and this one is by far the worst. Every single time I do drive thru there's a problem with my donuts. I ask for vanilla filled donut and I've gotten one that barely has any filling if anything at all! I thought I got a regular glazed donut while eating it! So I complained next time and so they made sure that I got one that was \"spilling out\". That has happened several times now. And I just got another vanilla filled one and they gave me like apple filled or something! Definitely not vanilla. The only reason I keep coming back is because this is the closest one to my house but I might start driving farther out if it means I actually get what I pay for."}
{"text":"I went into Bosa Donuts this morning to purchase some donuts. The donuts were delicious. But I must say this is some of the worst customer service I have ever seen in my life. 
There were bees inside of the donut display case I told the employee she looked at the insects and asked me what I wanted she did not attempt to remove them. She was handling money and donuts without ever washing her hands. She had an employee sitting eating her lunch she was called to assist with customers she did not wash she just went to assisting customers. 
Both ladies were extremely rude they were looking at us and talking in Vietnamese. I can only assume what they were saying. She scanned my debit card to pay and she basically threw it back at me. She did not say thank you or anything she just basically looked at me until I left.
We get Bosa Donuts all the time at my work in Tempe absolutely love the donuts. But I will never return to this place as long as they treat customers like this"}
{"text":"So good and great customer service my kids love this place."}
{"text":"Although this location is open late, the man at the drive-thru was so rude. Don't waste your time at this location this late, go in the morning when the nice staff is working."}
{"text":"Great product , good service and beautiful assortment of donuts , forgot this place was here . Like it a lot , very happy , cool collection of Hindu trinkets and ladies .... very chill ."}
{"text":"I went on opening day at 8:30 AM.  Not surprisingly, they were jammed.  The person who took my order was clearly overwhelmed and she kept looking around and talking to other people while she needed to focus on me and ring me up.  

The donuts were fine.  Honestly, in my opinion, they are not better than Dunkin Donuts, they just have different flavors and the price is right.

After not having any donut shops in years, Chandler now has a ton of doughnut shops.  Unfortunately for Bosa, Dunkin Donuts beat them to the punch and opened up their brand new shop earlier and is literally across the street by the corner.  

In addition, Rainbow Donuts is down the street on Dobson and across the 101 on Warner is yet another Dunkin Donuts.  Plus on Chandler between Dobson and Alma School, there is Krispy Kreme.

Kind of a lot of doughnut shops if you ask me."}
{"text":"Absolute the best donut shop in AZ. ...I really don't know what else to say! The apple fritter is probably the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Cute and sweet Korean family running this place but really thought the donuts tasted like Safeway or regular grocery store donuts (got the chocolate long John and cruller). But I don't have an alternative go-to donut place so I guess this is my only option and it's not bad. Would rather support them than buy a donut at Safeway!"}
{"text":"Always the best and service is amazing. I can't remember a time where they didn't give me extra donuts."}
{"text":"My sister and I visited my grandparents in Maricopa and every time we go to their house we always stop by this place because they love it so much. Unfortunately, they don't have this in Maricopa. It is our absolute favorite donut spot to go to!! They have a huge selection to choose from and they are always so fresh! After a couple of days, they are still pretty soft... just make sure you keep them covered or you can even transfer them into a container to keep its freshness! My favorites are the glaze, frosted, and the buttermilk donuts.... YUMMY! 

Bosa also always has coupons coming in the mail, so make sure you keep an eye out for those."}
{"text":"Every once in a while, I like to bring donuts to work, or for the guys painting my condo, or some other morning function... I ALWAYS choose Bosa... they are perfect every time!  Plenty of flavors to choose from and they are never out of my favorite (choc with choc sprinkles).  If you go to those other donut places, or the grocery stores....... just try Bosa once.... you'll never go back!!!  YUMMMM!"}
{"text":"Real Powder Smoothies! Not sure why the sign says real fruit since they told me they don't put any real fruit in them!"}
{"text":"I Wish I could like this MORE then ONCE and add some extra STARS!  Hands down the BEST Donuts/Pastries Coffee Shop I have EVER had! I'm from Chicago area and they have some excellent polish and Italian bakeys BUT YEAHHHH sorry Chi town Phoenix will always have you BEAT I'm afraid as long as BOSA DONUTS is in business OMG!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot it's close to me and the donuts are very good. It's open 24 hours a day and has a drive threw. Coffee is not the best and one of the guys that's works at night has been rude I few times."}
{"text":"Since the one on dobson and elliot isnt on here im leaving this here so the manager runs both. First we went on opening weekend and i get new stuff and little stuff will happen but the lady said our card didn't go through and we left and went somewhere else card worked fine. Low and behold our card was charged by bosa. So i call today and didn't realize i called the wrong one she told me to call the one on dobson so i go to look up the number and it isnt on line yet. So i call back and the lady was rude as heck. Finally get the number and call and omg the manager was super rude as well. Not letting me talk, talking over me, cutting me off and so on. I have never had the donuts there and after we get our refund will never go back. Rude customer service is never a good idea."}
{"text":"During my stay in Scottsdale, I've had one of their ham/cheese croissants and one of their glazed buttermilk donuts.  Both were excellent.  The fact that these folks are open 24 hours and have a drive thru will bring me back on my next visit."}
{"text":"I had Bosa donuts for the first time today.  I'm pregnant and was craving them really bad this morning!  We picked up a 1/2 dozen of assorted donuts and I couldn't even wait until home to dig into the box.  However, I was extremely disappointed and felt the quality of donuts was on par with grocery store bakery donuts.  Bleh! 

The only positive thing was they were fast and had a drive thru."}
{"text":"Bosa Doughnuts - I've heard about Bosa Doughnuts all over the valley but never tried them until the other day.  I'm so glad I did.  I had a small mango shaved ice, a cinnamon roll type of doughnut and an apple crumble doughnut.  Man ... they were sooooooooo good.  I almost ordered 2 more immediately after I finished them.  I'm a Bosa Doughnut fan for life!"}
{"text":"Ever since I moved to AZ everyone I know has been raving about this place. Now that I'm living in Chandler, there is a 24 hour location close by in Downtown Chandler.

I'm not really a big fan of eating donuts as I've never eaten any one donut where I'm compelled enough to write about it as I think of eating donuts only when I am rushing through an airport and am desperate to get something quick that isn't Pizza Hut or McD's. In fact, I can't even remember the last time I have had a decent donut.

So as far as writing about a donut experience, I guess there's always a first time. For some odd reason, moving and unpacking a house makes you crave food that you normally wouldn't eat...thus my cravings about eating a glazed donut came to me in the middle of the afternoon as I was loading boxes into our garage. Maybe it was all the heavy lifting that got me in the mood.

This particular Arizona Avenue location is close to Downtown Chandler and equipped with a drive through. And as a bonus it's 24/7. 

As soon as you walk in, the friendly nice ladies working the counter greet you and are ready to serve you up whatever your donut choice maybe. We got the 1/2 dozen deal which was abut $5.47 or so for some really nice looking donuts. The reason I describe them as nice looking is because the size of these donuts are not the petite ones like Dunkin' or their other competitors, the Bosa donuts are much bigger in size. For .99 per donut it actually feels like it's worth the price tag.

We ordered some old fashion cakes, a chocolate one, a maple bar and 1 glazed, all for the weekend. The very nice ladies at the counter packaged them in a nice pink box and off we went. The smell of these donuts was overwhelming when we were driving home. The donuts actually smelled like they were freshly made.

I couldn't help myself and as soon as we got home I slowly devoured the glazed donut, enjoying each and every bite. The glazed donut was so fluffy, and light and so sweet that I could feel my teeth hurting from the sugar. Just when I thought I had enjoyed every single bite and couldn't eat another one, I then took out the maple donut cut it in half and ate that one too. I was out of control. One was not enough. The maple one tasted so buttery, so mapley with a hint of pecan. This too was another sugar delight. 

These were the best donuts I've tasted in years...

In addition, this location serves breakfast and lunch sandwiches and BOBA. Can't wait to return try these items.

Overall, great friendly gals working the counter, good price and excellent quality for what you get and a quick in and out experience.

This will now be my go to donut place as this place was absolutely donut delicious."}
{"text":"Donuts 24/7! Love this place. Best donuts in town. My favorite thing to order here though is the ham and cheese croissant warmed up. It's the perfect breakfast. The staff is so nice here even sometimes when I have to drive at 1 in the morning and need a snack."}
{"text":"Like taking a bite out of a most perfectly sweetened cloud!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about Bosa. Now was the time to try the donuts.. and this is my review. 

Two donuts and a coffee for $4, not bad.
Coffee: Decent coffee, a mild american style roast. I have had worse.
Boston creme donut: Pretty good amount of filling, and the filling was tasty.
Frosted donut: Boring and fluffy. I have had gas station donuts that had more personality. 

I am not a huge donut fan - but I appreciate a great donut. 
This was not it. I agree with the minority on here that feels that there is no backing about the hype in regards to Bosa. I probably will not be back, as the hunt for the ultimate donut continues."}
{"text":"I LOVE LOVE LOVE DONUTS! So much whenever I go to California I drive all the way to the Donut Man in Glendora! Bosa I've been going to for s long time and hadn't been in years but my boyfriend and I decided to go there and it was delicious! We got 6 donuts and ate them all! Can't wait to go back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Just had my first Bosa Donut mmm mmm.  The flavor and texture reminded me of Winchell's donuts which I frequented when they were in town.  Until I tried Bosa, Dunkin was my donut place of choice.  I do not care for those sweet sweet Krispy Kreme donuts.  From now on, it's Bosa for me - sorry Dunkin"}
{"text":"2:30am, late night donut craving hits.... Unfamiliar with the area, my roommate and I scoured through yelp, and found this gem that is open 24/7. Jumped in the car, and easily found BoSa. They had a good selection of donuts, but I was a little bummed that they didn't have anything interesting/innovative, just the regular choices. The donuts could have been a little fresher, but hey, it was 2:30am on a Tuesday. Check this place out when YOUR craving hits. ;)"}
{"text":"Meh...besides the marginal service, I'd give the donuts a 3/5. They donut (get it?) suck but Dunkin is better. Improve the service and the coffee station and I might give it a 4."}
{"text":"Almost the best donuts in the valley. Get em while they are fresh and they are amazing. The plain sugar donut is by far the best on the menu. Simple but perfect. Also a plus that they are open all night. I have even sampled their breakfast sandwiches and their croissants are flaky goodness. Can't go wrong with Bosa;)"}
{"text":"The donuts were awesome, brought 24 of them back to the house for breakfast.  Would certainly come back again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to this Bosa Donuts location many times, and they get pretty busy in the mornings. 

However, the best time to go is in the middle of the night! Whenever we have midnight cravings for something sweet, we head to Bosa Donuts! They always have a variety of donuts on stock and the taste and quality never falls short! 

Try the crumb donut, its the best!"}
{"text":"They are just downright fluffy.  You've consumed far too many and it doesn't even feel like it.  They don't sit in your stomach like lead.  It's the most glorious donut experience ever."}
{"text":"I stopped in with a buddy of mine  to get a few donuts. The place looked like a regular donut shop by the naked, and it was in the afternoon so I didn't think  I was in for a good donut. I was totally wrong!!!   These donuts were amazing. Better then Krispy Kreme I have to say, and I am a fan of Krispy Kreme. 

I tried 3 donuts. The apple fritter, small chocolate sprinkle donut, and original glazed. Apple fritter was amazing, but my favorite by far was the original glazed. You can't just have one!"}
{"text":"I was told to try this place, and i really liked it. I already went back like 4 times.

Friendly staff
Prices are awesome
I like the donuts"}
{"text":"Super tasty donuts, will definitely return. The buttermilk and original are delicious! Prices are comparable to most donut shops."}
{"text":"Great donuts, great prices. BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE! The women working here are just rude as all h*ll."}
{"text":"In proper Jamie fashion I'm making Bosa my 60th review. Fortunately for me I live less than 10 minutes from this place. If I were ruler of the world there would be 24 hour donut joints like this within walking distance in every community. Their donuts are always fresh however, the full selection is not always available as they sell out quick. My favorites are the dozen donut holes for a $1, chocolate glaze, and sugar. The denseness of these donuts are spot on (gooey, chewy and airy all at the same time). Sweet but not overly so. I've even had their breakfast croissant which consisted of ham, cheese, jalapeno. It was good but the main attraction here is the donut so don't go here expecting gourmet anything else. The coffee is okay nothing to rave about but decently pairs with donut.  Beware of the service charge on your debit card if you don't spend at least $5. Service can be spotty depending on who's working (the elderly woman is much more cordial than the teenagers that sometimes staff the restaurant). Bosa is a great way to satisfy your fried dough cravings. PS- Yes these donuts are better than Dunkin and Krispy Kreme."}
{"text":"The hub and I love Bosa donuts and we were super stoked to see a new location opening in our neighborhood.  The store is large and clean, and the donuts nicely presented, but service is sub-par.  The kid \"helping\" me with my order was carrying on a conversation with his co-worker in their native language so he was pacing back and forth pretty much ignoring me.  I ordered a smoothie along with 6 donuts and the smoothie literally sat in the blender for 3 minutes before anyone noticed I was still waiting around.  

I think I'll take my business back to the 7th Street & Union Hills location where as the customer, I'm the focus of attention until my order is completed and I'm out the door."}
{"text":"Went there the other day and got Thai Tea boba.  It was not bad, better than what I expected the boba was soft and chewy and the thai tea was nicely mixed.  The only downfall is that there aren't very many flavors for boba."}
{"text":"I go here every other Friday to bring donuts to work. Everyone at work asks me to bring them every Friday because they enjoy them so much. The buttermilk donuts are awesome and the fancy donuts as well. The service is awesome and they care about what they do."}
{"text":"Love that this is a drive thru donut shop!! The flavors aren't different from other donut shops, but they're super soft and delicious no matter what time of day you go."}
{"text":"The best donuts in Arizona?  Yes.  Believe the hype because they're that good.

Open 24/7 with a drive through and an exceptional selection of donuts.  When I want a donut this is where I go.  I'll suggest the buttermilk, the apple fritters, and the glazed with white creme.

Finally a few people have commented that the staff isn't all that friendly but in my trips there they were VERY helpful and in fact they made me a couple custom donuts while I was waiting.  Custom made fresh donuts.  How does it get better than that?

They aren't lying when they say, the best donuts in Arizona."}
{"text":"Everything you want a donut to be! Soft and airy! They also offer cake donuts which are a bit thicker. Drive thru is 24 hours. Ever get a midnight craving and don't want stale gas station donuts this is your place. We went around 9:00 pm and case was fully stocked."}
{"text":"Best damned donut I've had in my life. Super soft and perfectly glazed...a vacation in my mouth! How the hell does anyone eat just one?!?!?!"}
{"text":"These are the most Amazing donuts!!! There was a great selection to choose from and the cost wasn't outrageous.  The staff was friendly despite being Very busy. Nice selection of drink options, too.  Definitely worth the stop!"}
{"text":"I'm personally not a donut fan but a Drive-Thru donut shop really intrigued me, so I had to try it. They also sell coffee, and iced coffee concotions. And even Bubble tea options.  I ordered a Cappucino but I don't know if there was a misunderstanding at the speakerbox but I ended up with some blended ice drink. It tasted a little ''powdery''.

The donut I ordered was a cinnamon sugar one. It was so soft and delicious. (I felt a little sick afterwards but again, I'm not a big donut person.) From the menu it looked like they have at least 12-15 donut options.

Definitely will come back for donuts but I'll probably stick to Starbucks for my cappuccino."}
{"text":"This place initiated my tuna salad sandwich on a croissant-kick. Seriously, so friggin good. I  constantly crave it.. 

When my sweet-tooth tags along, I tend to vouch for the maple bars or donut holes--- with chocolate milk! Nom."}
{"text":"3 stars for the donuts only. I kept hearing how good this place was and I will agree it is but they have a major issue, the staff SUCKS! We stood at the counter for 5 min while 3 employees ignored us while trying to figure out some piece of equipment. Once we were finally helped it was clear that the person taking our order had a very limited understanding of the English language.. This caused my order needing to be repeated several times, ending up incorrect and having extra items added. I would say the one thing you should make sure someone working the counter at any business can do is speak and understand the native language. Oh and the coffee tasted like it was pissed out of someone who had had drank coffee earlier that morning. 

If you go here be prepared for shit service if the girls working when I went are still employed here.

0 stars for the staff and coffee.
5 stars for the donuts."}
{"text":"I used to love bosa the one on Ray and Arizona but after my last trip there I will never go back. I order the blended ice vanilla coffee and when I had my last sip I found pieces of metals they were big enough to feel them in my mouth. When I called them and asked them to check their blender the lady said they did not have metal in their blender and she didn't know how they got there since they are very clean. I will not recommend this place or go back."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh! We have these at church all the time and they are the best. My favorite is the glazed."}
{"text":"Tasty yummy donuts, always fresh anytime of the day into the evening. Friendly staff, has a drive thru too!"}
{"text":"These donuts are good, but was not sure they live up to the hype for me. We recently moved to Arcadia and I was psyched to try Phoenix's \"best\" donuts. We lived in Central Phoenix prior and frequented Rainbo donuts at16th St/McDowell... which sets the bar pretty high to begin with.

I didn't really feel that Bosa was superior to Rainbo. My first visit was especially disappointing because I ordered a crumb donut which are so delicious and my favorite when done right. However, when I got back to my house they had given me those glazed donuts with crumb coating on top. Learned my lesson that you apparently have to say \"crumb cake\" here. 

Anyway, they are fresh and good... but not amazed."}
{"text":"Old fashioned Choco Donut!!!!!! I don't normally eat donuts, but when I do I go here. Best donuts ever. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I be been going to bosa for years. I will go out of my way just to get get donuts. Everyone hates me but loves me when they are eating heaven. Nomnomnom......"}
{"text":"It's always great to come here late at night and have one of their sandwiches. So yummy! All their donuts are fresh and have really great bubble tea flavors. Must try!"}
{"text":"The glazed donut holes are the best. Perfect for bringing donuts into the office or for a large group of people. Order ahead of time and they will have it ready to go when you get there. Iced chai tea was great."}
{"text":"Basically we only stopped here because it was across the street from Beckett's Table, where we were having dinner. I'm always up for a good doughnut. I went basic and got a raised doughnut covered in sprinkles. 

I thought this was a fantastic doughnut! In general Dunkin Donuts is fine for me, but this beat every other doughnut I've tasted. Since then, I've been on a kick and have been trying many other popular Valley spots such as Lamars and Rainbow. And still nothing has come close to Bosa!"}
{"text":"The only reason it does not get 5 stars is because they don't have icing filled! But their buttermilk Butterfly Donut is to die for!!!! Go and get one!!!!
Their donut holes have got to be the best I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Always a plus when you're craving donuts at 2am. I absolutely love these donuts. Any time of the day. The line is crazy in the mornings but very worth the wait. I can't believe so many locations are popping up but I suppose it's because they are so good."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE bosa donuts! The quality and the taste is nothing short of melt in your mouth amazing! I went there yesterday before work and got donut holes for all of my co workers. The guy who help me (sorry I forgot his name...younger guy) was very pleasant and helpful. $1.35 per dozen donut holes.!?!? Seriously?! AWESOME! Thanks guys for making me the star employee at work."}
{"text":"They have a very good selection.

When you're not in the mood for mass produced donuts from those chains, this is the place to go.

The donuts always tastes fresh.  Over the years, we have never encountered a stale donut from BoSa yet.

The chick that works there seems pretty disinterested that you are there, but either way, as long as she puts the donuts I want in the box and rings me up correctly, I don't mind so much."}
{"text":"Dangerously close(Arcadia) to me. Always friendly service. Make sure that if you'd like a great selection of donuts,then go before 9pm! Our selection of donuts at this location with our late nite 2am runs are very limited. Delicious apple fritters, inexpensive donut holes(only glaze & chocolate),the cold-cut sandwiches on a toasted croissant are terrific, but the boba drinks(only blended) are no good. Free wi-fi and clean."}
{"text":"So a friend of mine who is visiting from out of state told me about this place.  She raved so much about it that I just had to try it before I went back home!  OMG, the donuts here are DELICIOUS.  SO FREAKIN' DELICIOUS.  The service was little to be desired (maybe she was having a bad day but not even a smile from her!) but the donuts spoke for themselves."}
{"text":"I am not a huge donut person. For granted, they are good, but I just can't get over the fact that they have so much sugar.

Lol, I sound like such a party pooper, I know.

I did the drive through and I must say that intercom sucked. I hope that wasn't the status quo because that speaker box looked... and sounded... like it had been ran over the prior night during a drunken Scottsdale party. You just have to order and hope for the best.

The drive through was a touch slow IMHO. Two concocted drinks came out before the donuts which I found odd since all they had to do was grab donuts off a shelf versus making the drinks."}
{"text":"Not sure if my taste buds were asleep this morning, but the plain and glazed donuts tasted oily and left some oil spots in the box. The others were fine. I'm sure they were fresh."}
{"text":"Woohoo is right. These donuts are AWSOME! I will for sure return for my next donut binge. My favorites were the old fashioned glazed, and the maple bar. The bear claw was not worth it. The apple fritter is worth it. If you are near a Bosa then get some donuts."}
{"text":"This is seriously the best donuts I've ever had ever! The donuts are so soft and delicious. It's the perfect amount of sweetness. I would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Coming from somewhere that I would think you couldn't get any better donuts, I am a total convert. I couldn't believe that anywhere could come close to my favorite donut shop in New Jersey, but to no avail, Bosa BLOWS them away. Every donut is light and airy and not too sweet, which happens often at my place in New Jersey. 

The help is absolutely amazing and patient waiting for my kids to pick their donuts. I wish I could pick this place up and drop it next to my house in Jersey."}
{"text":"I've been here so far twice since the opening 5 days ago. Like the other locations, the donuts are amazing. Much better than Krispy Kreme, DD, etc. By far the best in Arizona that I have seen. Service is friendly and there is ample room for seating. Besides the donuts, I have also tried the sandwich/soda deal for about $4.50 and was delightfully surprised by the quality of the sandwich."}
{"text":"New, clean, and the donuts are delicious.  I'm glad I love far from here or else I'd be coming here every weekend.  It's definitely a great place to try ... and then fall in love with it!"}
{"text":"Dank doughnuts for a great price especially since its 1 am. Everything is always fresh as it should be. They also have great customer service. Also to the person was trying to order cream filled Donuts you ordered the wrong ones because every time I go in there I get a Bavarian cream filled doughnut."}
{"text":"I have just gone for the coffee and donuts.  The donuts are fresh, soft, and delicious. The coffee is great too! The ONLY reason it is losing one star from me is because of the service.  The service is either great or not; no in between."}
{"text":"My son loves the donuts here before school. Quick service, coffee is good and prices. Just not the nicest looking shop. A nice clean up or make over would def barely sell this place more."}
{"text":"They are not lying when they say \"Best Donuts in Town.\" They are made all throughout the day and even when you open the box at your office/home/wherever, they are still warm and soft! I cannot wait to ruin my diet and go back!"}
{"text":"Went here for natl donut day like everyone else before me. Was a bit disappointed that they were about out..like only had 5 types of donuts available like the holes and a few fancy ones. They said itd be another half hour before the next batch is out so i just had one that was already available one of the raspberry filled glazed and a thai tea which was good. I saw a man come in with his two young daughters, who asked if theyre gonna have more out, and after they told him 20 min he told them he will come back later, as im sure his little girls were disappointed that there were no sprinkled donuts left."}
{"text":"Bottom Line:  Way Way better than the competition (Dunkin, Krispy Kreme, Lamars, etc) and open 24-7.  Pretty hard to beat, not overpriced, always fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"These donuts are so extremely good. I have yet to try anything else on the menu, and I'll update when I do, but these donuts are DElicious! I always eat the maple bars but the regular glazed donuts are also very good. The ladies working there are also wry nice and there is a pretty nice atmosphere. I highly recommend getting your donuts here over anywhere else."}
{"text":"Open 24/7! Free wifi! Good service, didn't speak English very well. Don't have decaf tea. Maple bar was fresh, but bland. Good doughnut selection. Great seating area and patio."}
{"text":"Every donut here has been amazing! 5/5 for food and 3/5 for service comes out to 4/5 overall. I'm not sure why some reviewers have said that donuts here are extra pricey, as they're between about 99 cents and $1.50 per donut, comparable to most donut shops, unless you're buying your donuts from the grocery store or something.

I can't speak as to the drive-through system that everyone hates so much, because we always go inside (tip: with Bosa, always go inside if you care about your order being correct!!), but we've never had problems with order accuracy. The interior isn't fancy, but the donuts are good and I've never experienced too long of a wait. We've had cake donuts, maple bars, apple fritters, bear claws, and old-fashioned donuts (the chocolate-dipped ones are so good!) here.

Don't expect much of the staff - they're never friendly, and they won't answer questions with anything more than the bare minimum. The donuts make up for the service, for us."}
{"text":"I just moved to AZ from Colorado and discovered Bosa.... i almost wish I didn't because now I am addicted to the dang buttermilk donuts. They are so yummy! The customer service here is excellent :) I had went to a Bosa for specifically the buttermilk and they didn't have them, I then called this location and they had them and even held them for me!!! So sweet :) highly recommend coming to this location"}
{"text":"My cousin brought my sisters and I here. She said they have the best donuts. And sure enough they did! I bought a maple donut, but the lady gave me two in a bag. I asked my cousin why and that I only purchased one and my cousin said the other is free.
Well, hey two for me. :)

They have a variety of other things - coffee, smoothies, etc. and of course its like walking into Donut Heaven, just alot of different donut flavors, just can't decide sometimes on which one to get lol"}
{"text":"I usually have a wonderful experience at this location but this morning was very different. The Caucasian woman with the dark hair was very rude. She acted too busy to assist me even though the place was empty. Curtly dismissed me when I looked at the menu for two seconds instead of ordering right away. When I received my donuts they were smashed together and covered in jelly. I didn't order any jelly donuts. The bag they came in were also covered in jelly. I just don't understand how that happens unless you're an apathetic employee. Find a new job of you don't enjoy what you do. This place deserves better."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Don't bother. Staff are rude and can't speak English. They did refund my money when I complained, but proceeded to tell me it was my fault. The coffee is nasty and they put so much whole milk in it I couldn't even choke it down. They have no idea what an old fashioned is and did I mention they don't speak English? I would love to see a donut shop in the neighborhood owned by  a Patriot! I would rather farther and spend more at Dunkin!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. I'm all about supporting local ma and pa shops and restaurants but Bosa Donuts has the WORST customer service. I've tried this place because my work place gets a dozen every month for our meeting. I decided to come in for something sweet on a saturday night. We were not greeted upon walking in. Once at the counter I was asking what flavor a few of the donuts were and the woman seemed bothered that I would ask. Nothing had labels so I didn't have a choice. I am guessing her lack of communication was more of a language barrier, however, her attitude wasn't needed. I probably would have purchased a dozen but I walked out with one mediocre donut. I won't be back and definitely won't recommend either. I rather give my business to someplace who actually cares about their customers."}
{"text":"After driving from CA to AZ, my fiancé and I were craving donuts. New to this specific area, we used Yelp to guide us in the right direction. It was late afternoon when we got to this 24 hour donut shop and they still had quite the collection! I got the white frosted sprinkles donut, a maple bar and an ultimate apple fritter. My fiancé got the ultimate apple fritter and two maple bars. I was very satisfied with the sprinkled donut and the Apple fritter. The maple bar was a little dry, including the frosting. Overall I would go back!!"}
{"text":"Our go-to place for donuts. Bit of a drive for us, but it is worth it. Donuts are always fresh and they have a great selection, including croissant sandwiches which are super yummy."}
{"text":"I been there 2 times, the first time it was late but the young guy working the counter was awesome, as I walked in he received me with a welcome, gave me the whole donut tour.  When I was walking out, he told me to come back any time; he just seemed legit!  Second time was through the drive thru, they did not have a particular kind of donut I wanted, so I think the same guy just gave me 3 or 4 extra donuts from the other ones for the inconvenience!  The Donuts are tasty, specially the donut holes and the chocolate covered.  Customer Service was awesome both times and the Donuts were Excelente!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a donut addict, just ask anyone in my life. Luckily I'm not overweight and my arteries are still in great shape. 

The donuts at Bosà are wonderfully fluffy with the right balance of favors. Their not too dense and not like air either. Bosà is my new favorite donut place. 

The smoothies are nice and creamy and tasty, but slightly artificial in flavor. However, for my kids the smoothies are a far better option than a soda."}
{"text":"Great donuts. I am a big fan of chocolate glaze bars. Also pretty good boba Thai iced tea but some time the tapioca balls taste odd. Over all best mom n pop type donut place around."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that of course the drive-thru is 24hrs so you can get your donuts fix any time. No matter what time I go the donuts always seem fresh. They have donuts holes 12 for .99cents. What more can I say any donut you could want at any time its great."}
{"text":"OH MY GEEZY! These donuts are soooo good & always fresh no matter what time you get them! Chocolate bars & buttermilk are my favorites. Coconut smoothie is amazing there too!"}
{"text":"We have been a fan of their donuts for quite some time and is often a breakfast choice on special weekends or when we have out of town guests that we want to impress. But, recently we discovered the croissants. Hot hammy, cheesey.... Amazing. Even the regular ones are so flaky and moist and delicious. Also, the donut holes are another delicious (and cheap) choice. I keep meaning to try their boba drinks, but I always happen to already have a cup of coffee in hand when we stop in here."}
{"text":"Uh-may-zing. Their donut holes are so good they should be outlawed. Seriously, they're THAT good. And cheap!"}
{"text":"We were so happy when this donut shop opened.  They have a great variety, always very fresh and taste like donuts used to be made.  Their prices are very reasonable and we are sometimes able to find a coupon that gives you 6 donuts free when you buy a dozen.  They freeze really well so we buy a lot of the apple fritters at a time and freeze a bunch.  Pop one in the microwave for 50 seconds and you've got an incredible hot treat.  They have breakfast items and a variety of drinks but I've only purchased the donuts so far"}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! So glad they opened one up at this location. It doesn't matter what time of the day you go. They always have a good selection and the donuts are always fresh. Very generous on the donuts that have fillings and the donut sizes are bigger than Dunkin or Krispy Kreme."}
{"text":"This place is bomb dizzle. The donuts are always fresh. The ladies there are the best. So pumped to have them in the neighborhood. I'm legit sad if I buy Bashas donuts over this place. I'll never do that again. 
*Wish they made blueberry cake donuts with blueberry frosting on top. That's the sweet spot."}
{"text":"This place is a legit donut shop! 
Love the donuts, always fresh and soft!

NOT TO MENTION, THEY HAVE BOBA DRINKS TOO!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Phoenix for several years and I'm JUST NOW trying BoSa...Im a little slow at times, but I always get there :) let me start by saying, Im a Krispy Kreme kinda girl and I wondered what could be better than those airy little rounds of sugary goodness....then I tried BoSa...WOW! On first bite I KNEW I liked them better than KK and that's saying something because I've been ride or die for KK...BoSa donuts have a little more substance to it. Their donuts aren't just airy dough, although, they manage to keep them nice and fluffy and light feeling. The glazed is a must and a go-to for me. BoSa has just converted me over....for as long as I live in Phx I'm now a BoSa girl"}
{"text":"I visit AZ for work and always stop at Bosa donuts for a donut and iced coffee. What's great is that the drive thru moves fairly quick and I am never disappointed with the quality of the donuts."}
{"text":"Best donuts ever!! All was fresh, nice place.
I been there few time, they are always having great customers service.. It might seen busy but they are always quick."}
{"text":"Most Asian owned donut chains.over my years have been pretty average and this place continues the trend. They always make a ton of donuts, but few stand out, most will \"do the trick\" but nothing over the moon to show. The coupon in New Times is BOGO. Tried the classic glazed (good) and the crumb which lacked a good punch of cinnamon."}
{"text":"Insider tip: Try the sandwiches. We're regulars for Sunday morning doughnuts but I needed a quick bite and stopped in for Roast beef on Croissant. Tasty sandwich made with a fresh roll and veggies for a couple of bucks.  Well done BoSa!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I see all these great reviews on here and we basically walked into a Taco Bell. There's even a drive through... DO NOT COME HERE FOR BREAKFAST!!! They do not have a grill. Instead, they microwave the eggs..."}
{"text":"Quite simply the best donuts in Phoenix! Try the buttermilk, the original glazed, and the cinnamon crumble."}
{"text":"Great service I accidentally ordered the wrong breakfast sandwich ( and pregnant girlfriend was pissed ) when I went back she just gave me the correct sandwich for free and was very nice about it!  also the breakfast sandwiches are great, and the doughnuts are amazing"}
{"text":"Holy shit, why can't every donut place be so exciting?"}
{"text":"Bosa donuts boasts the best donuts i've ever had. They are so good, you cannot just eat one. By far the softest and tastiest donuts around."}
{"text":"Boss Donut Alert! 

I'm still dreaming of the apple pie donut I had here on my last visit. Believe it or not, this was my first time having such a donut, and I am crazy about apples. 

Located in a strip mall with ample parking spaces, Bosa is open nearly 24 hours a day. A group of us wandered in here at 9 in the evening on a Saturday, craving sugar after a long day of bar hopping. We were immediately greeted by a friendly proprietor behind the counter, and were pleased to find a deserted store in which to munch. 

They have a crazy selection, too. I nearly picked a maple bar, but ended up settling on my apple treat. I did take a bite of bae's maple bar though, and it was fantastic. These donuts are fresh and pillowy, melt-in-the-mouth good. Stupid good even. 

The donut I'm raving about was stuffed full of fresh and flavorful apple pie filling. This donut rivalled even the famous Rainbow Orchard apple cider donut. I'm not kidding, Apple Hill Fans. I am so stopping here the next time I visit my Phoenix bestie. I've got my eye on the Boston Cream. Bosa is a MUST.

Ps they have food food and boba drinks too!"}
{"text":"Omg these were the best donuts i have ever had. So fresh i had to buy a dozen. I went back the next day. Cheap and fresh i could not ask for more. I really wish they had lactose free milk and i didn't have to make to stops but these donuts are to die for the buttermilk donut was the best Follower but the apple fritter"}
{"text":"Service not so good lately.  One really nice girl there.  But the rest are pretty unkind.   They mess up on orders a lot too.  I ordered a tuna croissant and got home and it was a turkey yucky sandwich of which I threw away.  I called back to tell them and the girl was rude.  And I got no apology.  Terrible customer service THAT is."}
{"text":"Bosa is amazing!! Their ham & cheese croissant is so damn good!!!"}
{"text":"i'm often stuck at 2am craving something, and with Bosa if its donuts I dont have to go to bed grumpy and disappointed.  They corner the late night market and still put forth the effort to make the donuts fantastic.  You can get ice cream and other treats here as well, with a drive thru window for the ultra lazy."}
{"text":"This place, 
Eeh not so so bad!
Love that it has a 24/7 hour drive thru and helps me and my sister get our late night smoothie plus boba fix. 
I can say I have better options but just aren't open late night.."}
{"text":"Okay so a friend of mine knows the owner so I had been meaning to check this place out but never made it to there shop. To my heavenly surprise, a fellow associate brought in 3 dozen doughnuts from Bosa in today! 
Let me tell you, every doughnut I had was fantastic! I ate one in the morning, the second around noon, then my third around 3 and they all tasted delicious! I love this place and will go there at least once a month!"}
{"text":"Staff was nice. I asked if they could supplement hot coffee for an iced coffee in a combo number they offer with a donut but she seemed confused and then said no. 

Therefore everything is a la cart if you want a iced coffee. Get a hot coffee and one donut for under $3. A small iced coffee that they call medium is $2.99 plus one donut was $4.29! Kinda high for that."}
{"text":"This place is located right on Dobson and Elliot with 24-hour drive-thru service, which is awesome!!! Their donuts are so soft and rich, and I highly recommend getting the strawberry glazed donuts. It's a new donut store so it's really clean and quiet. I'm gonna make it my study spot before everyone starts coming here. 


People, come give this place a try! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This location moved a little further south on Arizona Ave.  Look for the old KFC (the bucket marquee is a dead giveaway, lol)
The donuts are always on point. 5 stars for the donuts!
However, we've been going here for years and we also usually get smoothies with Boba along with our donuts. The smoothies are a hit or miss, which is the reason for the 3 stars. Sometimes there's still chunks of ice, or they don't put enough ice, so it  watery. 
This last visit over the weekend was the first time, we had under-cooked Boba in our smoothies. So disappointing since we're paying $4 per 16 oz. cup.  With all the other Bosa Donuts popping up, I doubt we'll go back to this one, unless it's just for donuts."}
{"text":"These Donuts are the best!!  I actual crave these donuts! There are light and delicate. And fried to perfection. Have never had such an awesome donut ever. There croissants and French breads are delicious as well. They also serve up sandwiches and smoothies! You can't go wrong when choosing BoSa has your one stop shop for great donuts, croissants and French bread... 

It's been a few years since I last went to BoSa, donuts aren't the same. Realized what made the big difference in these donuts was, they use to use Dawn flour products and yes there's a difference. They now go with Westco and the donuts are heavy and no different then Dunkin Donuts. The once very special donut is no longer lite and melt in your mouth. Tried several locations and found it to be the same through out the valley.  So no more donuts for the employees. Have to scout for another bakery. These donuts use to be such a treat for everyone in the office."}
{"text":"Breakfast, lunch, dinner.. or in need of munchies this donut shop is my favorite in AZ!  Staff is friendly and always helpful. And obviously all the donuts are delicious!"}
{"text":"The buttermilk donuts are INSANELY delicious, followed very closely by the chocolate donut holes! Great donuts overall. 

I subtracted one star for the somewhat unfriendly staff. Every time we go, they always seem annoyed at and impatient with the customers. Aside from that, definitely worth coming here!"}
{"text":"Wanted to see what they had for doughnut selections, just got a dozen doughnuts at Dunkin (Since THERE IS NONE IN THE NORTHWEST!) Anyway, the selection was pretty good here, (although wish they had a Strawberry filled doughnut) 
The prices here were pretty reasonable, and this places was nicely done, although the parking seemed a bit weird IMO- but they probably dont have much say in that.
The lady behind the counter was very friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"After several recommendations from friends, my husband and I went to Bosa in Chandler and ordered a 1/2 dozen donuts. There are a few booths to sit in the small building as well as a drive-thru for some quick 24 hour eats. We ordered chocolate long-john (awesome and fluffy!), glazed (good...would be great fresh/warm), raspberry filled glazed (meh...one glob of \"jelly\" on the side of donut), cream filled glazed (odd cream...super thick like frosting or glaze; also a glob on one side), and sprinkled/frosted raised donut (pretty good but nothing special). We would get glazed and long-john again and will definitely try the apple fritter and bear claw next time. All donuts were good and very cheap! Good experience for our rare donut cravings. Time to work off these donuts while I am on a sugar high!"}
{"text":"Absolute favorite place to get donuts!! I am a classic girl and love their glazed donuts!!!"}
{"text":"The donuts at this place are decent, the cinnamon roll is actually pretty good. Their selection is pretty large and looks fresh. Coffee is decent. But my experience today is kinda meh...

I came in here to redeem a coupon which had \"get a free dozen\" or \"get a free 1/2 dozen\". It was my day to purchase for my co-workers, so I wanted to redeem the free dozen, and then buy a half dozen, plus a coffee for myself. When I walked in I explicitly said \"free dozen\" before handing over the coupon. I was in a hurry to get to work so I didn't think too much about how much she charged me. Well turns out she charged me for the dozen instead. I can't help but feel a little ripped off even though it's really not much money.

Moral of the story is, make sure you add up your own numbers."}
{"text":"Originally, I searched for a cafe or restaurant that serves boba drinks and I ended up finding this neat little place. They serve what known as Iced Thai Tea boba and it is excellent if you like sweet drinks ; )

The donuts are extremely well made and not hard so stale like many other donuts locations. Probably the best I had. I have been here since day one and will continue to come back. The staff are friendly and I have even met the owner.  

I really do recommend this place, you can go wrong with this donut place!"}
{"text":"I wish that I didn't like this place so well...but I do :)
Yummy, fresh, delish donuts like I used to have on Saturday mornings as a kid (my Dad would go to the now-defunct Dad's Bakery and get donuts and pastries on Saturday mornings).
There is a wide variety available, and they are wonderful!
In addition, they have great coffee drinks, as well. 
After trying Bosa Donuts, you'll never visit a Dunkin Donuts again..."}
{"text":"Great donuts and okay coffee. Cold service and awkward store atmosphere.... Not as many options neither...

That's all I can say about this location..."}
{"text":"after reading all the reviews I had to try this place and I'm glad I did...I had the ham and cheese croissant which I love but can't find in many places it was delish! Tried the lemon jelly donut, yummers- not to sweet, light and tasty, I left the evidence all over my clothes."}
{"text":"Decided to give a more traditional donut a try instead of Fractured Prune, our usual go-to. Glad we did! Really great apple fritters as several other reviews mentioned, and the other donuts I tried were also great, especially the Tiger tail."}
{"text":"Dont believe the hype! Uncle Sals is very average.  I love good Italian food.  I only gave it 3 stars because I couldn't give 2.5 stars.  The Cesar salads had to be 80 degrees and lacked any real spice, 2 croutons.  My Wifes veal Marsala was tough, the sauce was lacking, the green beans were mush. My veal parameasan was good but it had an inch of sauce on top, the alfredo was ok.  I dislike meat on top of pasta or potatoes  because when you cut it you crush it into the pasta  The wine list was good, the teramasu was good. For $240 for four people it wasnt worth it, subtract $78 for wine it was still high.   Overall the restaurant was average not at Marcellinos five star rating by any means."}
{"text":"really difficult for me to give bosa 3 stars. the donuts really are the best... but a few things prevent me from leaving a better review.

5 stars for the donuts... when i can get them, i have to go into central phoenix for work on Fridays, i stop by bosa on my drive home usually around 11 pm although being open 24 hours the 3 donuts i went in for were all sold out. this is the case every time."}
{"text":"Only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because when my wife asked a couple of questions the lady rolled her eyes and had a bad attitude. Obviously not the best thing to do our first time there. Donuts tasted great and fresh but will not recommend to others or go back just based on our first experience."}
{"text":"The donuts are so light and fluffy, not at all like those dense blocks you get at a certain, big chain. I'll definitely keep coming back here for more!"}
{"text":"The best donuts in the AZ!! They are always open 24/7. The donuts are so delicious in the early AM. @0500 as they are just made and in result will melt in your mouth.  Awesome find!!  The glazed are the best!!"}
{"text":"Bosa is my go to place for donuts and breakfast sandwiches. Thier coffee is absolutely amazing and I will pick it over any coffee shop!  The last few weeks I've went at various times and they say the don't have any filters,  therefore there is no coffee. I try to make it up to myself by getting a blueberry donut. On this particular visit,  I decide to eat my donut while I'm waiting for the bobas I ordered for my family. There's a hair in the donut so long,  I can floss my teeth.  Now,  I can usually over look the poor service I always receive when I go in the afternoon because the service in the morning is great,  but after she handed over my bobas and knocked it all over my car, not once but twice, I won't be returning.  Ever."}
{"text":"Taste great.  Good service.  Good price. Only negative is that the Jelly filled never have much jelly in them though....."}
{"text":"This is our favorite donut place, we frequent this location often and have never had a bad experience. We love their maple bars and boston cream donuts!"}
{"text":"Best donuts I've ever tasted. Seriously. This particular location is my favorite. I've been to two of their other locations but this one seems to have the largest selection of fresh donuts. They are super light and airy. Their croissant sandwiches are also really good (and cheap!). Service is super friendly and did I mention they're open 24 hours?"}
{"text":"It's more than just doughnuts.....
Didn't have time to try anything else but a glazed doughnut and a bite of a long John. 
They are beautiful and fluffy. The first two bites were amazing, but by the time the third bite came along, I could feel the grease on the roof of my mouth. But, that won't stop me from going back and it shouldn't stop you from trying a doughnut, unless you have blood work scheduled the next day! It's a clean and well lit joint. Hope it stays that way."}
{"text":"If I were only grading the donuts --- I think 10 stars would be in order. However, everything else on the menu that I've had is horrible. I order a hot cocoa once, DISGUSTING. Also, the lady that works there and takes the order is so rude!! BUT, the donuts are fabulous, so go here for donuts, just be prepared for horrible service, and don't order anything else off the menu."}
{"text":"I am so a fan. I like to get donut holes and share with my pup. We both liked the donuts being served at BoSa Donuts. No wonder they want the stadium name changed to BoSo donuts!!! Brad got a couple of donuts. He ordered a blueberry and maple donuts. He did not talk much while he was enjoying the donuts. He is picky about his donuts. He says this is going to be his go to place from now on. Must be nice to have a great metabolism. I will stick to sharing with my dog. 

I like the way the donuts are not overpoweringly sweet. They are good and tasty. The person at the counter was attentive and pleasant. The store was clean. Did not go into the restrooms, so I don't know if it is clean or not. I think they will be clean."}
{"text":"Awesome...... Absolutely $@@&$?$ awesome. In a world full of Nic Cage movies every now and then you need to escape, Bosa Donuts provides that escape for me."}
{"text":"Amazing!  The donuts are delicious and fresh the numerous times I've been.  The dozen donut holes for a dollar is a steal.  In addition to the donuts, the ham and cheese croissant (I get mine with jalapenos)  melt in your mouth!  (Sometimes they give you a croissant that's been baked previously, slice it open and slide in the ham, cheese and jalapenos.  This is still good, but the best way to have it is the stuffed one, where everything is baked in the croissant.  You might want to make sure it's the stuffed kind and not the impromptu version.)"}
{"text":"BOSA never disappoints. My son was craving bacon for dinner. Solution? BOSA to the rescue. Stacked with crispy bacon with egg and cheese in a freshly baked, flaky croissant, this breakfast sandwich can be purchased 24/7 for the hefty price of $3.09. 

When I got home, I thought I won the Mom of the Year award when I surprised him with the sandwich. I got a big hug and a \"You're the best!\" He proceeded to devour the sandwich with glee. All was good until, \"Mom, did you only buy one?\""}
{"text":"I heart Bosa donuts. These are great donuts and they never disapoint. Quick service."}
{"text":"I eat here more than I probably should. The donuts are soft and delicious. I think they're known for the buttermilk donuts, which are a tiny brick of glazed cake. The service is quick and polite. Go here. 

Only bad thing is that they charge like 50 cents for card payments on orders under ~5 dollars."}
{"text":"I love Bosa donuts. For years. 
Normally, when I go to the other locations and order 2 donuts and a medium coffee, they know it is a combo #1 and charge me accordingly.
This morning, I place the same order at this location and get charged over $1.00 more than the combo price.
When I pointed out the discrepancy, I was berated by the cashier for \"not ordering right\" and he refused to give back my money.
So remember people --- order right or get charged more.
If in doubt, ask the cashier. He'll give you ordering lessons."}
{"text":"I usually only like glazed donuts -- yes boring I know! Lol but Bosa has one of the best ones in town! I get the regular glazed and the glazed twist! Oh so delicious!!! Perfect way to start my morning!"}
{"text":"Poor service. Dirty. Good donuts.

Service is very poor here, the staff serves you but not friendly. On one trip through the drive thru we received one wrong donut.  After driving home and realizing the donut my child wanted was missing I went back to request the correct one.  The cashier said \"where is your receipt\" and charged me for another donut like I was going to waste my time and drive back here to scam one free donut! I stopped frequenting this place anyway because it is frequently very dirty. Only reason to give this store any stars is the donuts are very good."}
{"text":"Awesome donuty goodness, served up by a friendly Cambodian family.

What's not to like.  Gonna get me another donut in October."}
{"text":"It's so unfriendly there, especially the drive thru. Food is good. I know it's a tough job,but courtesy is part of the job. I'll try a different location. Maybe it's just this location"}
{"text":"Finally, central Phoenix gets a BoSa Donuts! Perfectly housed in the former Carvel Ice Cream building in the Thai Lahna strip center, walking into the space is like being transported to a sanitized version of your favorite 24-hour SoCal fried dough joint (and much more cheery than Rainbow on McDowell, which has seen better days). On this maiden pre-work run, I stuck with a maple long john and coffee. The dough was tender, with no off flavors from old fry oil or chewiness from sitting around, and the icing had a nice sugary snap. The coffee was standard-I am eager to try the chai milk tea with boba pearls on my next visit.

The only small suggestion I would make to the owner is provide a little more seating and turn up the AC ever so slightly. I know donut shops are usually a tad toastier than other eating establishments, but if you are going to offer free Wi-Fi and stay open until 10, it will definitely help build a visible eat-in clientele at this new location."}
{"text":"The more and more I come here, the more this place goes down into the shitter. I came tonight to pick up three donuts with my baby sis since this is the closest donut shop near me. Now I've been coming this place since it first opened and it's just kinda been one of my go-to spots. After tonight, not anymore. Not only did they get my order wrong FOUR different times, they charged me more. There were two ladies there and they did horrible. 
And the worst part was the regular drive-thru lady had a BABY in the back with her. Like Congratulations on your child, but you're running a business here. Never coming back here again. Going to Rainbow Donuts instead."}
{"text":"The donuts were pretty good. I'd definitely come in the morning when they are fresh because around the evening time, they're a bit stiff.

Pick your fancy, they are all good."}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap donuts.  So wonderful when you luck out and get warm donut holes."}
{"text":"While it is somewhat embarrassing to write a review on how good a donut shop is, I feel I must do it. Bosa is hands down the best place in the Valley to eat a donut. They're indescribably good. I've been to many of the locations and they all seem to be consistently good. The product they serve is outstanding and I have been ruined for all other donuts because of this funky little shop."}
{"text":"If you've never been your missing out. Some of the best donuts in town. Some are open 24hrs. Downside is the wait. There's usually a decent line and 1 person working. They make coffee and boba drinks here too."}
{"text":"The donuts are great when they are fresh. Problem for me is that I come in very early and sometimes feel like I'm getting leftovers from the night before. I hope they quality control and toss donuts that have been sitting out too long, but it doesn't seem like it. Ask for new ones off the rack if you're suspicious of old-looking donuts!"}
{"text":"This is the only location I've been to. But the donuts taste great! Always fresh. The service is always friendly. This location is 24 hours which is definitely handy. I haven't tried anything else besides the donuts but no complaints so far."}
{"text":"First time coming here.. i loved it, they had alot of variety of donuts. First time truing Strawberry Boba and it was delicious!! Definitely will be coming back here alot more!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The donuts are always fresh. They are open late and still have a good variety to choose from. They could update their drive thru speaker because sometimes it hard for them to hear your order. The donut holes are my favorite items to get. So addicting you cannot just eat one!"}
{"text":"One of my co-workers had told me about Bosa Donuts and said it was the best donuts she had ever had.  Wow, I'm truly a fan; they are very light and do melt in your mouth...YUM, YUM, YUM...."}
{"text":"What isn't there to love about Bosa donuts? I love this place for their donuts and awesome savory breakfast sandwiches, and there is a drive thru for when you're feeling especially gluttonous and lazy :). The donuts are light on the inside, dense on just the outside layer, and not overly sweet. I have yet to have a bad donut from Bosa, but I especially love the old fashioned. The breakfast sandwiches are great, I love to get them on a croissant, and though I'm pretty sure the eggs are precooked and just microwaved like at McDonald's, the light and airy croissant just takes the whole thing up a notch."}
{"text":"No not all Bosa's are created equal! This is my absolute favorite donut store in AZ.
No one makes donuts as delicious and delicate as they do.  The donuts literally melt in your mouth are always fresh.
very much out of my way, I drive many miles just to get donuts from here.  I wouldn't even consider buying donuts anywhere else."}
{"text":"The place has great selection  . It is always stocked and plenty  of help . They are not the friendly bunch"}
{"text":"Competes with Krispy creme, the blueberry cake donut was deeelicious. The dozen donut wholes was surprisingly priced reasonable, and the old fashioned dipped in chocolate, of course, was very tasty"}
{"text":"BoSa has the best donuts, hands down. I was so excited when they finally showed up at 32nd St & Shea so I no longer have to drive 5+ minutes to get my fix. I've always gotten great service from all BoSas, this is no exception. When they first opened, there was a new kid working who was pretty confused about the line of orders (and my experience was contrary to the other racist reviewers, he was white and an English-language-native) but even that wasn't bad service. 

Love the coupons and the drive thru. My only complaint is I've never been able to get chocolate donut holes at this location. :( But probably good since donut holes are $0.99 a dozen and my ass does not need them."}
{"text":"I've been addictive to boba lately and it's been hard to get some late at night, until now! This place is open 24 hours and they have a drive though as well. They do donuts, breakfast, smoothies, boba and more. There is a nice spread of donuts right when you walk in. Nice variety of donuts to choose from. 

Remember there is a drive though. I missed it the first fee times but it's there. You come in around the back and then come out between the two buildings.

The people are super nice and they remember you. They always make sure you are satisfied.

Boba has been consistently good now. The boba is coming soft and very yummy! I am very excited!

Overall, this is a great place and is open 24 hours. There boba is really good and they have serval flavors to choose from. I might end up trying something from then breakfast menu next time."}
{"text":"Bosa donuts are pretty good. But this location specifically has the most unfriendly staff. The store is not very clean as well. I prefer other donut shops to bosa donuts on mcdowell"}
{"text":"Grand opening!  One free donut or coffee per person April 14-20th!  Clean, spacious, great service, and plenty of seating!  

Open 24 hours!!"}
{"text":"Great donuts, best bearclaw I've had in a while. However their hours are very confusing and they are not always open when their hours claim to be."}
{"text":"I love Bosa's =) !! 1: because they have some good donuts 2: they sell boba tea and 3: because they are open 24hours!!! I just love love loveeee the fact that they are 24 hours. Satisfying my late night munchies haha =D"}
{"text":"I love Bosa Donuts so much and I am glad now there is another one even closer to my house! I love that they are also open 24/7 because this girl loves her donut fix  The staff is super friendly and super kind! Plus if you go in till 9/15 you get a free donut"}
{"text":"Note this is a donut shop (period) 

It is not a coffee shop with fancy lattes, espressos and Americanos in cups with invented names. 

Plain and simple it is a fairly decent donut shop that also sells coffee. The location is great (. Not many donut shops nearby ) the store itself is new, clean and spacious   

Every donut I tried was good and fresh. 

The counter staff were very friendly and helpful. 

The store opened for the first time in mid November 2013."}
{"text":"Poor customer service is an understatement at this location. I had a coupon for a breakfast sandwich and coffee. I ordered a breakfast sandwich and iced coffee. A man prepares my meal and I sat down. One of the employees comes over and takes my ice coffee away and states the coupon is for a hot coffee and not iced coffee. Wow. I will never come to a Bosa Donut again."}
{"text":"I would give zero if it were an option.  I've tried to like them.  I really have. I've given them so many chances because 6 out of ten times, they're pretty darn delicious.   But this last experience was my final straw.   In the past I've written corporate but received no response and I imagine this will fall on deaf ears as well.  Last night I went in at 6 specifically for an apple fritter.   When I got home, my excitement turned to sadness as I held my overdone and hard fritter in my hand. Ever the optimist, and tapping into my inner MacGyver, I thought dunking it in coffee would help.  Nope.  I bit into pellets.  Not real pellets, but tiny hard little pieces of fritter that has been fried into pellets of disappointment.  So, I weighed my options.  I decided to return to the scene of the crime.  I was once again met with the customer service that kills puppies and dragonflies.  No, they didn't apologize, no they didn't offer me condolences.  They instead looked at me with disbelief and indignation.  As usual, they acted put out and inconvenienced.    I left my sad dead fritter on the counter, being scrutinized by an obviously jaded baker, and I refused both a replacement and a refund.  Consistency, perhaps a smile, maybe a cheery greeting would be worth the odds because when they're good, they're good.  But now I have to buy my fritters elsewhere.  If you go, don't make eye contact and good luck."}
{"text":"I love the original Bosa's off Arizona Ave so I'm happy they opened this location bc it's so much closer to my parents' place! It's not open 24 hrs, but it's a bigger location and is fully stocked with drinks, cafe goodies and of course donut trays! And yessss they have boba drinks and their famous buttermilk donuts here as well :)"}
{"text":"I don't want to shy anyone away from going here because the Donuts are Great.  I gave a three star ranking because I just don't think that they are the \"Best Donuts in Arizona\".. I am a huge fan of Dunkin Donuts strawberry glazed and that's what I ordered, but my girlfriend brought home Bosa.. Because on the Box it said \"Best Donuts in AZ\".. I'm sure many people think so becauE this is a great business, but not the best in AZ by my taste.."}
{"text":"Have been going to BoSa for almost 5 years..friendly people, excellent service and the donuts are AWESOME! But they have sandwiches, bagels and coffee drinks too...everything you need for morning wake ups, late nite cravings and anytime in between! Have been telling my daughters about BoSa and they're customers now too:)"}
{"text":"These doughnuts are delicious! I can't begin with how wonderful they are.. light and fluffy! Prices are great and the customer service is excellent! These doughnuts are addicting and everyone in the office loves them!"}
{"text":"Take this from someone who has never liked donuts. Nope, not even as a child. Nope, not even Krispy Kremes. 
These are AMAZING!!!
I could come here every weekend. So cheap (75 cents each) and so delicious! I got the chocolate sprinkle donut and it was just perfect. The frosting with silky smooth and the dough was like a pillow. I had to check them out to see if they lived up to the hype and they did! My husband tried the original glazed donut and he loved it as well!
I want to try more of their donuts, and also their smoothies! Their breakfast sandwiches don't look half bad, either. They even have a drive-thru! Staff were very nice and helpful. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is bananas...and bananas is good!  I'm so happy Bosa opened up a location within 2 miles of where I live.  I either drove to the Chandler location or the one on Southern.  Their donuts are so good, it's worth the trek.  This location did NOT disappoint.  The store is very clean, friendly and the donuts are amazing.  My favorites are the maple long johns, apple fritters and if they have them, the cake donuts with chocolate icing sprinkled with peanuts.  If the owners are reading this what I would love to see in the future are king size donuts.  A larger than life glazed donut where it takes up the whole box.  Ha ha.  When I bring Bosa in to my work it does not take long for my co-workers to gobble them down."}
{"text":"My favorite are the plain glazed donut holes. A cute pink box of those will make any day the best day ever!!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews and have to agree. These are the best donuts I've ever had!! Price isn't bad either. Love this place :-)"}
{"text":"Thanks to National Donut Day a few weeks ago I sort of got into a donut-kick. 

I heard this place had some really good donuts (but can you really go wrong with donuts?). 

My wife and I walked in and it was pretty slow. There was only one worker who was completing a drive-thru order. It took her a while to acknowledge us. We checked out the donut case and my mouth was watering. I swear I had a Homer Simpson moment.

They had so many good looking donuts! They were all so beautiful! I got a pink frosted donut with sprinkles. 

But the experience here was made even better by BOBA! 

I couldn't believe they had boba tea and smoothies! Throw back to my high school years. 

They had breakfast and lunch items too! Maybe I'll try one of them next time."}
{"text":"These donuts are amazing!  Super light and fluffy and a good size also.  Plus, they are a good price.  I got half a dozen for right around $5.  Definitely better tasting than anything else I've had locally and just as good if not better price."}
{"text":"Better than Krispy Keene.  From a southern boy that is high praise. Service was great and they gave me an extra donut."}
{"text":"24 hour donut shop! OK!!!

Fresh donuts round the clock, what else could you ask for? The donuts here are pretty much the same as all other donut shops, nothing really stands out.

They are pretty fresh though and they don't get hard after a day like some places. 

They were near where I was staying in AZ so it was convenient."}
{"text":"I picked up some donuts for the fiance's birthday this morning and oh my, were they as good as ever! This location even has a drive-thru, so you can go in your PJs and not feel guilty! We are both a big fan of old fashioned donuts and they even had chocolate ones; his favorite! YUM! This is the best place in town for homemade donuts, 100%. Since there is a Bosa close to home, I know we'll be back again in the future. If you're feeling daring, get a bear claw!! They are HUGE and delish! Happy Friday!"}
{"text":"When I was a kid I lived in this small neighborhood in the bay area. I used to grab money from my moms purse and then walk up the street and find ways to spend my money. There was a circle K, a hair salon, a video store complete with a beaded curtain section (of which my step brother was a fan. I know this bc I was a snoop), aaaaaand a donut shop. 

It as an oriental run donut shop and those always seemed to be the best in my experience of eating donuts while living in the bay. they had a mean maple bar. It wasn't overly sweet and had a perfect amount of saltiness and chewy-ness while remaining fluffy and moist. it was a great donut and what I consider a 'bay area style donut'  for no other reason except that i ate this kind of donut while i lived in the bay area. i didn't think anyone else made donuts like this.

until I arrived at Bosa. it's run by orientals which is a good sign when it comes to donuts so I tried a maple bar. oh my gosh! the donut brought back all of those memories of tattling on my step brother when I found his naughty movies and regretting my choice to get a perm at the hair salon once while bored. 

this is a bay area style donut! it's not krispy kreme(which is also a delicious donut) and it's not dunkin (which isn't a delicious donut) it's a different donut class of its own.

if you like them chewy and fluffy while a tad sweet and salty go here for your donut pleasure!"}
{"text":"Doughnuts and sandwiches are made fresh daily. Thai and bubble tea are delicious and reason to stop by alone. No reason to ever go to a grocery store or crispy creme with Bosas around."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness......I have not been to a Bosa Donuts in years!  I remembered why I liked Apple Fritters so much.  Bosa's are the BEST!@!"}
{"text":"One of my roommates was extolling the beauty of Bosa.  I asked if they were as good as Rainbow, but she had never tried Rainbow.

So - we decided to do a taste test.  Three of us in the house - so we would get 3 different (but like) donuts from each.  The plan was to bring them back home, cut to sample size, and note flavor, texture and overall preference.

The guy roommate's favorite is glazed raised.  The gal leans to sugar raised and I figured glazed old fashioned is a safe baseline for taste testing.

We went to Rainbow first.  No problem getting the donuts we wanted.  I also picked up a half dozen donut holes.  Was not thrilled to be charged $0.50 for the box, but c'est la vie.  Girl roommate also got a watermelon frappe type of drink.  A bit sweet for my tastes, but very, very watermelony.

Next stop Bosa.  They didn't have regular sugar raised - used powdered sugar instead.  (I have a hard time trusting that the regular sugar didn't stick - somehow they managed to make it work at Rainbow!)  So the granulated vs. powdered sugar raised would not be as scientific a comparison, but we'd make do.  No problem with the glzed and old fashioned.  We also picked up ham and swiss croissants.  One can never have too much pastry, right? :)

Results - 
     Glazed raised - Bosa was slightly denser and chewier - more mouth satisfaction.  Rainbow was cloudlike fluffy and light.  Great texture, but we didn't feel satisfied from chewing.  Rainbow was slightly sweeter.
          ~Votes - 3 for Bosa.~
     Old Fashioned - textures were identical.  Rainbow had a slight lemon (or maybe aspatrame?) flavor in the back end of the tasting.
          ~Votes - 1 slight lean to Bosa, 2 Draw~
     Sugar raised - texture of donut was identical to glazed raised above.  (duh - same donut, different topping.)  The gal roomie likes granulated.  The guy roomie preferred the powdered.  I liked both.
          ~Votes - 1 Bosa, 1 Rainbow, 1 Draw.

So, Bosa comes out with a slight edge.  And we came out with a slight sugar rush.  I can't help but wonder what our next scientific food research challenge will be!"}
{"text":"Really nice family but The coffee tasted a lil outdated. I give them 3 stars for being a good sport taken the picture."}
{"text":"3 words. Fresh Fluffy Donuts. So yummy. Great staff to serve you. Try it."}
{"text":"I spotted this place while visiting the Pig's Meow next door one night and had to try their donuts the next morning. The chocolate cake donut with chocolate frosting and sprinkles is divine. I could have eaten more than one and was tempted to take some away with me if I didn't have to drive 5 hours in the desert afterwards."}
{"text":"Simply the best donuts out there. Warm, Soft, Fresh, and Fluffy.

One of my co-workers brought in a box of Dunkin Donuts once. I politely thanked them but I was secretly thinking \"What a barbarian, are they trying to kill me?\"."}
{"text":"Wow awesome donuts anytime of the day you have to love this place it is awesome! Not the best donuts I have had but close enough!! Check them out!"}
{"text":"Our family loves Bosa donuts!! I take them
in for my co-workers and my son's preschool and always have the best compliments on how delicious and fresh they are. get some!"}
{"text":"I randomly picked this shop because of good reviews and being close to my house. I didn't realize they had Thai tea (which I love) among other Asian tea options until I got there.

It's a typical close quarter donut shop with great looking donuts, dingy interior, and plenty of morning customers. But that doesn't detract from the staff's friendliness, the wonderful smells, and how delicious everything was.

I had a medium size apple fritter and a cake donut (like the sour cream cruellers - is that the right kind?) thing that looked a little like a muffin top. Fritters are my favorite and they did not disappoint! Very good. And the cake donut was outstanding too. Even the coffee was good.

Only suggestion I have is that they label their donuts, there weren't any labels and I wish I knew what to call the cake donut muffin top thing."}
{"text":"While picking out donuts,  discovered an entire tray of glazed donuts covered, COVERED in ants. I was beyond horrified.  

The lady behind the counter didn't seem shocked in the slightest, I suspect that they are completely aware they have an ant problem.  Places like this are why the health department exist."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a dozen donuts on a Sunday morning after hearing so many great reviews and stories of Bosa. 

The location is centrally-located, although if coming from anywhere in the avenues, it's a bit of a drive to get to. For me, the traffic was slow enough that it didn't take all that long to get there. 

Upon pulling up at the drive thru, the person quickly wanted my order before I was ready. There was no one behind me, so I'm not sure what their deal was. I just needed like 5 seconds to spot the donut selection on the menu. 

Anyway, when I pulled up to pay (they take Amex, yay!) the gal was very short with me, barely giving me time to sign the slip before tossing the box of donuts in my lap. In the end, the donuts were great, that I was happy about. But the service, not so amazing in my view. 

I'll go 4-stars for this place."}
{"text":"These are the absolute hands-down bestest donuts I've ever had in my life! Wow. So amazing!!! Nevermind the fact that I decided to get donuts after my best friend's birthday drinking binge and after ordering pizza... Donuts, especially from Bosa are super yummy! 

The selection wasn't that extensive when I walked in (I mean, how could it be when I'm sure the donuts sell like hotcakes, and I walked in after 10pm, lol), but still had a few that caught my eye and made my mouth water. Ended up buying a dozen -- 'cause sharing is caring! (Ok, fine, I didn't share. I just went on a donut-eating-binge.)

The donuts at Bosa are super moist and tasty! Not too sweet, where you feel like your teeth are forming cavities as you eat the donut, but yet sweet enough to satisfy your sweet-tooth. I would highly recommend Bosa donuts to anyone -- day or night. I wish they were closer to me so I could indulge more often... although maybe it's a good thing they're not. haha."}
{"text":"Some of the boss donut places like the one more in the Tempe/mesa area are not as good but this Bosa donuts is of pretty good quality. They somehow know make their donuts repeatedly feel fresh and people I share them with love them. That said, especially during late night periods, there are times where you walk in and their batches are more dried out. So sometimes it can be a hit or miss. That's why I walk in so that I can better tell what's fresh and what isn't. However, compared to so many other donut spots in the valley, they still on average do a better job."}
{"text":"The people who run this store and the employees are awesome, easily one of the best Bosa's in the valley. Doughnuts are A+, smoothies, breakfast sandwhichs,  all bomb!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the donuts here for the most part.  I usually tend to get the glazed ones.  I have tried the apple fritters and they are not good.  It's like just eating oil, they have zero flavor.  I wanted to like this place but after visiting a few times in the evening, I most likely will not return.  I understand that it's a donut shop, but the teenage girl behind the counter is more concerned with talking on her phone and to her friends than serving customers.  They definitely need to up the service."}
{"text":"Best Apple fritters! Clean location close to my house and open 24 hours. They sell donut holes for 1.19$ a dozen.
They also have sandwiches and drinks but it's about the donuts.  Buttermilk and old fashioned are good top.

I did ask for just 1 donut hole and I wasn't allowed to get one haha."}
{"text":"The owner or worker definitely assumed the sale and tried to push the dozen donut holes for 99 cents on me too.

Nothing special about these donuts when you're used to California o nuts and cronuts. I'd have to say I was a bit disappointed with the quality but the only saving grace were the blueberry donuts.
Great flavor. Moist and yummy.
The sour cream and old fashioned were just blah.

This location has great parking and is next to gigis cupcakes. We actually were going to get cupcakes but they were closed so settled for donuts.

I hear they have another location in tempe also that might be more popular amongst all the late night college kids after a night out.
Just under $6 for half a dozen donuts in a cool box to go 
If you are not a donut officionado, try them out."}
{"text":"I love Bosa donuts because it is cheap and serves breakfast. I usually order the ham, cheese croissant- my favorite. Despite the donuts are not as fancy as other places and there is NOT maple bacon donuts there - sad sad. Hence why the price is so cheap but the donuts are so large. This place opens 24/7 so if you're just craving sweet at night, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Midafternoon in Chandler, but on the way back to Tucson--what could be better than an iced coffee and doughnuts? I have a doughnut connoisseur with me (my hubby who many years ago worked for Bosa and made lots of doughnuts for them). It is 2 p.m. and there are at least 5 customers in the restaurant (I take that as a good sign). There are so _many_ doughnuts to choose from, it's difficult to decide. So, I choose the glazed. Hubby says glazed doughnuts should have a yellow ring around the outside in the middle of the doughnut (check!) and no grid marks from the tray they are placed on (well a few, but who cares?). Nicely glazed, we both agree! The taste to me was almost perfection. This is very, very good for a glazed doughnut. The coffee (ordered their iced with an Irish Cream flavor) was ok, but not great, as there was an aftertaste (maybe from the ice?) that I didn't care for. Customer service was quite professional and excellent. Wish we had these doughnut shops in Tucson; they would certainly give the major chains some good competition. The 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the fact that the very best doughnuts I have ever had (to which these are compared) were produced by a local mom/pop (now out of business) store in Mesa, known as Wright's. They made the best glazed doughnuts ever, and the best blueberry cake doughnuts as well. So, thank you, Bosa, I may now be a lifelong customer!"}
{"text":"My wife insisted that she wanted donuts for her birthday yesterday. I thought we could change things up and try a new donut shop 23 miles away. Driving 23 miles one way for donuts helps for a more memorable moment. Well, Bosa definitely delivered. First off, their customer service is A++. They were very helpful and answered all my questions and gave great recommendations. My wife and I had their ham and cheese croissants. They were insanely amazing! That was pleased to see how inexpensive a dozen donut holes @99 cents. We also picked up 2 dozen donuts to take home to my clan. Their donut selection was very large and they definitely may be There best tasting donuts in AZ. These people know their donuts. All of their donuts are fresh. They are very sweet and fluffy. They are the dozen red roses of donuts!"}
{"text":"The donuts are the bomb, but the staff isn't the happiest bunch of peeps, but their kind. Nice place though"}
{"text":"I was so excited to see another Bosa Donuts opened in a convenient location to where I live...and it's open 24/7 too!  The staff was very friendly and the case was full of many tasty treats to choose from.  I selected the glazed twists and thoroughly enjoyed them - so tasty!"}
{"text":"East coast born. This location best donuts so far in ARIZONA AT A REASONABLE PRICE FOR A DOZEN. Great selection and always French and crispy"}
{"text":"I went to this Bosa at 37 W. Baseline Rd in Tempe (Baseline/Mill) on my b.d. for my once-a-year & one and only favorite donut (old fashioned w/maple glaze). They didn't have it so I asked the clerk if she would dip one of the old fashioned donuts in the case in maple glaze for me. She said \"NO!\" I said I'd be happy to pay extra and again I received a great big NO! I took my business to the Bosa at 1835 E. Southern Ave in Tempe and presented them with the same request. The nice lady not only honored my request, she wished me a happy birthday. I will now patronize this store and will let my friends and family know to give their business to this Bosa donut shop in the future. Thank you Southern/McClintock Bosa for helping to make my birthday special!I"}
{"text":"The donuts are great but the service needs work. I was the only one in the store at 6:15 in the morning and it took a while for someone to come out even after I called out to let them know I was there and then she kept disappearing in the back while I was placing my order.

I ordered a dozen donuts. The chocolate cream filled are delicious. The others are great too..Old fashioned, glazed, jelly....the selection in large and they are all yummy. We didn't try the apple fritter but I hear it is a signature item. I also ordered a Thai iced tea boba...it took forever for her to make and it was just ok. It was just too sweet. I won't be ordering it again but we will definitely be back for the donuts and maybe some shaved ice.

I am hoping that as they work through the bumps of a new location the service improves or they add some more staff to speed things up a bit."}
{"text":"I have to say that this place has the best apple fritters ever!!!!  Their sandwiches are awesome too!  I don't know about all of them but the tuna on toasted bagel rocks!! you have to get everything on it..  I think they put jalepeno peppers in the sandwich which gives it a little kick.  I used to get it on croissant but the croissant got soggy.  I've also tried the roast beef too and it's pretty good!"}
{"text":"Can I give less than a single star? I just got a \"breakfast sandwich \". It was horrible. A lukewarm smashed croissant with 2 tiny pieces of bacon and a cold piece of American cheese. All for almost $4.00. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Got a watermelon smoothie, bagel sandwich, and a dozen donuts.

The smoothie was amazing!! And I had the sandwich on my walk back to the art museum. It was so good! This is the perfect location for a Bosa and I was really impressed with the quality for a place that was newly opened. Keep up the good work guys and I will be back as often as I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"I found this place after one of those midnight cravings. I googled late night donuts and Bosa came up as being open 24 hours. I was so surprised a 24 hour donut shop existed. I was not going to complain. I made the 5 mile drive and was extremely pleased with what I received. I LOVE maple bars and that is exactly what I got, along with an old fashion devil foods cake chocolate cake donut. Yum, Yum, Yum =) I couldn't be happier. I've come here many times after that late night excursion and introduced a number of friends. None have been disappointed. This is a fluffy, delicious, and inexpensive donut that you'll never forget."}
{"text":"Delicious and always fresh doughnuts. This place has the best buttermilk doughnut you'll ever eat. Count on all the classics as well as speciality doughnuts. Open early morning and late night for whenever that craving hits."}
{"text":"Fluffy, light, airy, delicious. What else do you need to know? I mean its donuts dude. Yelp don't lie."}
{"text":"I wish I could rave about this place like my fellow Yelpers. I wasn't impressed and it takes a lot to screw up the basics of coffee and donuts. Maybe it's this location, maybe the staff didn't have their morning cup of joe. I had really high hopes for the donuts since I have a sweet tooth.

First off, if you run out of donuts before mid morning, that's a problem for a donut shop. Coffee should never be served out of a dispenser. Secondly, if your staff has to growl at customers, that's not my idea of a wake up call. I love donuts, even better you offer boba. Maybe we can try this again, at your Arcadia location."}
{"text":"I love this bosa location. They have a variety of goodies from their sandwiches to their delicious huge selection of donuts. They also send out great mailers with some good coupons."}
{"text":"These doughnuts are fresh! Just rolled through the drive through to get breakfast. service was fast and the doughnuts were fresh as usual. If you like fresh doughnuts this is the place for you."}
{"text":"These donuts were pretty fantastic and the bagel sandwich we had was pretty good, and so was the coffee, the strawberry smoothie was definitely just some ice with strawberry milk in it. We found out very quickly that the drive through should be avoided, the person taking our order didn't get half the things we ordered the first time. But that was the only hiccup."}
{"text":"After Boxing class this morning (Shhhhh!) I stopped in for a donut (Really, just the one, Dear!) and loved the customer service I received. Donut was delicious, I think.. I ate is so quickly I don't remember! :)"}
{"text":"This place is legit! You can tell that these babies are fresh fried ol'school donuts. I used to work in a bakery and can tell when a place serves par-baked stale donuts. Not here. Seems to me that the fry them up through the day too because no matter when I got them up, they are fresh, chewy, soft pillows of sweet heaven! While I'm not a fan of cake donuts ( these tend to be more dense and sweet) even those served here are amazing. 

You can sit and enjoy your treat at this location as it has ample seating and free wifi. 

What to expect are classic donut flavors. This is not the kind of shop where you're gonna find some off-the-wall crazy flavors. Think glazed, boston, buttermilk etc. 

They have other stuff on the menu, but it doesn't impress me like the donuts do. Not that it's bad, just doesn't stand out. 

This place is worth checking out! Especially if you have to bring a brunch treat somewhere."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best donuts in town. Friendly staff.  Would highly recommend this donut shop to everyone"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness.  I never eat donuts, because I feel like they're a dessert that you should eat at breakfast and I don't ever feel like desserts at breakfast.  That makes sense, right?!

Well, my husband had just gotten a PR at the Fiesta Bowl Half Marathon and I'm pregnant, so that clearly justifies desserts at breakfast!  Hence, our first trip to Bosa.  

I could smell that donut-y smell from outside the building - yummmmm!  A spell came over us and we bought a dozen donuts for the two of us.  They were delicious - my favorite was the Bavarian cream filled chocolate one.  

These are definitely a special treat for me - but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Solid late night donut place. Open all the time with some unusual drinks and a drive through. Its dangerous having a great dessert haven around the corner from my place but it certainly reaffirms my love affair with this area!"}
{"text":"Awesome donuts!  Boston cremes were just about perfect.  Kruellers were good.  The fritters - I've actually had better, but these were good still.  Their donut holes are so cheap and pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"Our older kids LOVE Bosa donuts! This place has become a staple for treats, especially during family get-togethers. They usually make a Dutch Bros and Bosa run!"}
{"text":"This place is great and the donuts are always fresh and super soft.  I like how this one is open 24/7 pumping the deliciousness out!  Some of the others in town, which are also great, are not always open.  Get a chocolate old fashion and a maple bar, cant go wrong.  Free wifi is a nice addition."}
{"text":"The best freaking glazed donut I've ever had in my whole entire life. Drive-thru is convenient, employees are helpful and nice! The location is a little bit out dated, but hey, usually hole-in-the-wall places are the best, and Bosa fits the part perfectly!"}
{"text":"Delicious mango boba smoothie and the donuts were so moist. I bought the toasted coconut and the pink sprinkle. Quick and nice service."}
{"text":"If you want a delicious donut in the morning with a good, simple cup of coffee, this place is the place 4 u. 

Be careful of the long lines. Some people want to order special drinks and sandwiches , if people do that, you'll be in line for a hot minute."}
{"text":"The best tasting and selection of fresh donuts always have hot coffee and cold coffee made
Also offer many sandwiches breakfast and lunch good prices boba drinks & refrigerated, open 24 hours a day, and clean bathrooms as well."}
{"text":"Awesome new location easily accessible off of the 101 that doesn't differ from the quality of the other location in chandler. They're open all day so its a good alternative that I actually prefer over the usual greasy burrito after a night of drinking."}
{"text":"The Chandler staple for donuts. Always fresh and always open its hard not to stop by when you're driving by. I noticed they're starting to make more of a variety of donuts so that's awesome. I don't know what else to say but if you love donuts you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Service at this location is awful. There were 3 or 4 customers in line...the clerk said she'd be right with me then proceeded to wash dishes instead."}
{"text":"For my daughter! BOSA ROCKS!!!  She can scarf 2 doz. doughnut holes in less than 1/2 a block from leaving their window! \" liitle puffs of heaven\" she calls them. I got smart and order and pay for them the night before a sleep over. Usually order 5-6 doz. and that's only 3 girls. I grab them before they wake up...OMG! I am Mommy of the year when they wander into the kitchen! Why should the sugar high end at 4 in the am,that they think I did not know about! Yee Haaaaah! I know! I Know! But, you are only a kid once. I am totally organic, gluten-free. You just gotta BOSA!  Kind like op -op- op nam- gangnam style!  Bosa will rock your morning socks off!"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good local donut place nearby, but this is IT!  Awesome, fabulous, yummy donuts.  Great prices, fast service, plus a drive through.  LOVES."}
{"text":"Awesome donuts and breakfast food at a very good price."}
{"text":"Oy.....I have a feeling I may have caught this place on an off day, but first impressions are what they are. 

This place is a DUMP! I'm so grossed out. The floors and tables are filthy, there are bees flying all over the place (I've counted at least 12 bees), 2 of which were hanging out in a donut case. There are foul mouthed high school kids cussing up a storm while laying on sofas in the main eating area. 

The donut and coffee were probably pretty good...but I was busy trying not to touch anything and hoping to not get stung. 

...they have a drive through...which I suppose may feel like a safer option, but just don't look in the windows! 

I need to go take a shower...and call the health inspector."}
{"text":"Incredibly cheap, open at all the right times, very unique flavors, and basically way better than any of the chain donut places you could ever eat at. Must try: buttermilk, coconut, banana cream pie. So good!!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! Great donuts...service is just ehh. The girl who works the counter just seems like she does not want to be there. Last time I was in she had her cell tucked into her bra having a conversation. I thought I was going crazy at first, looking around to see who she was talking to. Could be 5 points but down to 4 because of service."}
{"text":"So darn good.    Owner very sweet too.    Better than the other donut shops on the street.    Blueberry Apple fritter my fav"}
{"text":"Best donuts ever! So much better than Dunkin Donuts, the staff is always friendly & the donuts are fresh & delicious."}
{"text":"I was told this was the best donuts in the area. I decided to buy 2 dozen for the fellow coworkers. Everyone loved these. The staff was very nice and patient while we picked out our donuts."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have never been to Bosa Donuts until this weekend...man, have I been missing out!  These are some seriously good donuts! We tried the glazed twist and chocolate covered glazed donut this time, but I have my eye on many others for my next visit.  The staff was super friendly and I love that they have a drive-thru window too."}
{"text":"Better donuts than DD, especially the glazed.  Also love the donut holes.  Only 99 cents a dozen!  I personally only had the glazed donuts but I'm told by my family that their fruit filled donuts are also very good.  More filling than DD. Service is friendly and price is good. They also have drive-thru Window."}
{"text":"I love this donut place!!!! Definitely the best chocolate donut I've ever had. If I lived in Arizona, I would definitely be going here all the time for the chocolate donuts"}
{"text":"Love Bosa!  Excellent donuts that are always fresh. My only complaint would be sometimes I go in at night to be prepared with donuts for the morning and there is nothing left. . Also the Boba smoothies are amazing!  Taro is my fav!"}
{"text":"What can I say ?  This is awesome.  I am a donut fan and would give Dunkin 4 stars, just like this place.  Great variety, great coffee, fresh donuts.  The extra 1 star comes for the fluffiness of their dough.  Its very fluffy and its done just right.  

Dunkin is good but its donuts will taste a little hard and \"old\" when they have been sitting for a while.  For some reason, the Bosa donuts dun get too hard, even after U buy and drive for like 1/2 hour home.  I know its not located in the best part of town, but they are open 24 hrs and there is a drive thru.  They accept credit cards and discover :)"}
{"text":"Bosa Donuts is a local family-owned chain creating some pretty darned tasty treats! They are open 24/7 and seem to consistently bake/fry throughout the day. The workers all are super friendly, and I'm told by most my beloved caffeine addicts that they pour a mean cup of Joe. 

Everyone I bring them to absolutely adores these donuts, my SILs even get requests from friends back home in NY who have enjoyed them to pack a box when they visit! My FIL loves the jelly donuts, the chocolate Long Johns look phallic, Scott is an apple fritter fan, and really, they all disappear in a flash when I pick up sweets. 

We are fans, especially since there's almost no other options for 24/7 food outside of a Casino here. They have croissants and croissant sammies, but we go for the Diabeetus here. 

* Drive-thru available *

* inexpensive compared to the 'gourmet' joints (around $10/dozen) *"}
{"text":"Best donuts ever and donot holes, staff is always friendly, i've been in at all hours of the day and always amazing"}
{"text":"I love bosa donuts i have been to several locations and this is by far the worst. The lady that works there with the funky colored eyeshadow has been rude to me on 2 different occasions. 

I have never been greeted by her. She tossed my card to me at the register when she was done swiping it. Little things like that just really piss me off. Especially when I am a repeat customer. 

I suggest going to the bosa donuts in mesa by bookmans! The people there are nice and the facility is very clean! Go where u are appreciated."}
{"text":"I was hired at Bosa Donuts only two days ago and started today. I was eager to start until being \"introduced\" to the other employees and the owner, who greeted me with blatant disrespect, talked to me condescendingly and treated me as if i was stupid, and proceeded to talk trash about me in their primary language (not english) to each other and myself. Their customer service skills were lacking, and although I have no experience running a business, I know that you shouldn't talk to employees or anybody with that much disrespect or apathy. I highly recommend that anybody wanting to visit this establishment, whether as a customer or potential employee, go to a different location, or get your breakfast elsewhere."}
{"text":"Let me start off my saying I'm a long time customer and up until this morning would recommend Bosa to everyone. With that being said what I witnessed this morning was disturbing on so many levels. As I stood in line this morning waiting to place my order it appeared that the man in front of me was a bit impatient as they were busy as they are most weekday mornings. I over heard a brief verbal exchange between the man and the employee behind the counter and couldn't believe what I heard. The employee informed the customer that he could go behind the counter and help himself to whatever doughnuts he wanted. At that point the man proceeded to go behind the counter, grabbed a box, and with out reservation began reaching into the case grabbing doughnuts to fill his box. The employees didn't stop him as if it were a normal practice. The man didn't wash his hands and obviously hadn't been trained on safe food handling procedures. He then came from behind the line with the box of doughnuts and went to pay. Needless to say, myself, along with the other customers standing in line were appalled by what had just transpired. With the laundry list of health code violations that I had just witnessed being broken I made a conscious decision to remove myself from the establishment without ordering and will NEVER patron this business again. I have always been a huge proponent in support of local business but can say without hesitation that Bosa Doughnuts will never see my business again."}
{"text":"BoSa is in Scottsdale! They just opened today...we sampled a dozen at work this morning and they are delicious.  The glazed is so very tasty and the texture is much more substantial than the Krispy Kreme glazed, but still very light.  I also tried the apple fritter (like another review commented, crispy outside, light and fluffy and apply inside) and the Boston creme...this is my measure for all donut places.  It was very, very good.

The new location is at 7444 E McDowell Rd."}
{"text":"Our first time here won't be our last! Friendly greeting, quick service and good prices made the donuts even tastier!!! Try the French curl, airy and not too sweet."}
{"text":"Back when the Doughnut Peddler had their ice cream/smoothie/sandwich/doughnut parlor on Val Vista and Southern, these were my favorite doughnuts.  Sadly, I moved, and then moved back near the area and they were gone.  Now they have since replaced Krispy Kreme (yea) but never been the same quality.  

Bo Sa has taken over as number 1.  Hot, Fresh, Delicious.  A wide variety to choose from and very affordable.  Conveniently open 24-7 too.  Since I found them randomly 6 months ago I no longer miss my old stand-by (even better than what I remembered a decade ago)."}
{"text":"Great little shop. Went there at 8pm and the shelves were fully stocked with doughnuts and my favorite, apple fritters!  Had an apple fritter and it was delicious.  Nearly the size of my head and perfectly cooked. Lots of apple bits as well.  A new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Best Donuts in town. I normally get a small black coffee and a buttermilk cake. Fresh coffee and donuts all the time!"}
{"text":"24 hours.  Get donuts at 3 am.  Automatic 5 stars.

however, their donuts are better than Dunkin'.  Not much donut competition in Phoenix, though!"}
{"text":"Yelp saves the day again and I end up at Bosa's Donuts. My mission was initially to search for Thai Tea with Boba in the local area and I end up at cute little donut shop. Its cute and cozy in the inside and offers free wi-fi  and a drive thru! The tea was good and the boba was cooked well and proportioned (no one likes to be skimped on boba) Even though I came for tea I couldn't help but notice the eye candy of donuts galore. There was quite a selection and decent prices so I couldn't help but walk out with half a dozen donuts on impulse and curiousity. I'm no donut connoisseur since I tend to go to Quicktrip or fry's for donuts but bow chicka bow wow these donuts were soft, fluffy, and delicious. Even though I don't live near by I'll make the effort to stop by. Did I mention there is a drive thru? What more can I ask for?"}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service, donuts are delicious, I highly recommend the mango smoothie it's delicious!"}
{"text":"Good coffee- they have the packed cups as creamer, So half and half, hazelnut, and French vanilla. 
Donuts were awesomeee
The apple fritter was ok. Not that chewy, the edges were too crispy for me. My boyfriend said he liked his though, so I guess just not chewy enough for my taste. 
The girls/ ladies working were very sweet. 
Big sit down area inside!!! 
Huge selection! 
Next time going to try their boba!!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by a Friday morning a few months past and have been meaning to write a review. I've had donuts since then from other donut shops, but none compare to Bosa. The price and quality at Bosa are far superior to all others. You can't go wrong with the donut holes."}
{"text":"Bosa donuts speak for themselves!! Fresh & delicious!! This location was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"We picked up half a dozen donuts for our drive from Phoenix to Sedona. 
1 buttermilk, 1 apple filled, 1 cherry glazed, 1 cake glazed, 1 coconut and 1 chocolate glazed.

My favorites were the buttermilk and the apple filled donuts. 

I thought they had a good variety of donuts and were decently priced. A solid 4-star place. No unusual topics or gourmet donuts of any kind here. Just the regular classic good ol' donuts."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. My favorite is the donut wholes. At. $.99 a dozen, we walk away with Atleast three dozen. Warm them in the microwave & you have little bombs of deliciousness."}
{"text":"I tried the glazed and chocolate sprinkle donuts. They weren't bad, but not amazing either. I'll probably go back with lower expectations next time I need a donut fix."}
{"text":"Delicious donuts, super strong coffee and very nice young ladies all work there.  100% recommend a chocolate sprinkled donut."}
{"text":"Bosa Donuts, I still love you.  And now I can't visit Phoenix without coming to visit.  Sadly, I always leave with a big pink box too.  Your donuts are the shit, and the cake versions hold up oh so nicely and go so well with my morning coffee.  The apple fritter and the buttermilk especially make my heart sing. But don't sleep on the yeast donuts either! Soft, fragrant pillows of joy.  I like the plain and the strawberry frosted.  However, I don't think you can go wrong with any donut here. Definitely delish."}
{"text":"Wow, a real donut shop!?! Awesome! There is a severe lack of \"real\" donut shops in the Valley. Usually you're only options for a donut are a national chain donut shop (where they don't even make them on-site anymore) or a grocery store (where the donuts are usually dry and uninspired). Ahh, but now I know about Bosa: an amazing and local, on-the-corner type donut shop that has a big selection of freshly-made, delicious donuts. How fresh? They're still warm; they melt in your mouth. How delicious? You can't eat just one. Really. No, for real. I dare you."}
{"text":"So glad their is a Bosa in Ahwatukee! Delicious and soft! Great variety all the time. Ice coffee so good too!"}
{"text":"This place has atleast 30 different donuts to choose from at any given time. The coffee is ok and the service is friendly, though slow at times (patience is a virtue!), but the reason you go there is the donuts and they are the best in the valley period. My favorite is a french cruller that DD has been butchering for years...but they do them right here. The buttermilks are exploding out of themselves and are one of the richest things I've ever had in my life."}
{"text":"I love BOSA!!!
Just the best tasting donuts in town. My kids beg for these when we drive by.
Keep doing what ever your doing!!!!"}
{"text":"Guilty little pleasure stop. The donuts are totally great, smells good, friendly staff. My son ordered a strawberry smoothie took one drink and didn't want it. I tasted it and it tasted like straight powder. Donuts are a 10, but stay away from the smoothies."}
{"text":"The freshest donuts I have ever had! The cake and fluffy donuts were equally delicious. They melt in your mouth! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Best donut shop ever!! We moved away and missed Bosa so much! We've never found a place that compares. In addition the coffee is our favorite too! I'm not a big coffee persona and I crave it. Their bacon, egg, cheese croissants are amazing as well!(I need protein in the morning)."}
{"text":"Bosa donuts are always a delicious and affordable treat to  take to work to share with coworkers, especially since they're conveniently open 24/7. The staff at this location is hit and miss for friendliness, but service is always quick."}
{"text":"Best raised donuts EVER !! So light and fluffy. Buttermilk bars are a very close second. So hard to choose."}
{"text":"Blueberry donuts. Nuff said. Well I guess Yelp wants me to say a lil more about this place. Good service and all the donuts are amazing and affordable. Try em."}
{"text":"I don't like sweets for breakfast, no pancakes, no french toast, no cinnamon rolls. All the sugar just makes me feel sick the rest of the day.

Then I met the Bosa buttermilk bar. For a breakfast made of those bad boys sign me up for a day of two root canals, pass a kidney stone, and give birth to triplets. It'll be worth it!"}
{"text":"I went to Bosa yesterday and to be honest, I am pretty dam torn. I believe I do like Krispy Kremes yeast doughnuts better though. Bosa's yeast doughnuts although fluffier and larger, are simply not as light and airy as Krispy Kremes yeast doughnuts. I feel like I can eat a ton of doughnuts at Krispy Kreme since they are so light. Bosa's were not bad though and reminded me of Dunkin Doughnuts. Its really just personal preference. However, Bosa does have absolutely amazing, moist cake doughtnuts. I tried the chocolate coconut one and was amazed at how good it was considering cake doughnuts usually are dry and not that great. Would I go back? If I was in the area and craving a doughnut, for sure!"}
{"text":"They are always out of a majority of their donuts whenever I go. Unfriendly staff. Not worth it"}
{"text":"Bleh! 

I've heard good things about this place from my sister's friends (notice, I didn't say \"my\" friends) and I've always been curious.  Errand days are kinda ho-hum anyway, so I was excited to finally check this place out.  The reason I order a doughnut that is stripped off glaze and topping is that I'd  like to taste the actual product. 

Two doughnuts for my little guy and me for $1.60.  As the girl handed me the paper bag I was extra careful handling it for nothing.  Cold doughnuts?  Am I just so used to piping hot beignets?    Right off the first bite, I could feel the cheap hydrogenated oils coating the roof of my mouth.  Then the second bite, the feeling is now in my throat.  Eeek!  I asked my son what he thought.  \"It's okay,\"  he stared at the doughnut and looked up at me.  I grab his doughnut and along with mine threw both in the paper bag it came with and chucked it.   Honestly, it would have been better to fry these sinful things in lard.  There is something about chemically laden food that I despise most!

Would I give it a second chance?  Not until they change their frying oil!

Sorry, Bosa.  One star is for the nice service and the other star is for being a local chain."}
{"text":"This place has some of the most amazing donuts ever. The inside and out side is very clean the staff are all friendly and helpful. It shows they truly care about customer service. I have been here once a week since they opened and will continue coming back. I really want to try there breakfast sandwiches soon.."}
{"text":"This donut shop is very clean and inviting on the inside! There is also a nice patio with outdoor seating. The donuts and the iced coffee were all delicious. My favorite was the glazed buttermilk cake donut! Service wasn't overly warm and friendly but they were polite, so no complaints!"}
{"text":"The boba is great, the donuts are great but the customer service is abysmal. I still give them my service, only because they have snacks and such, but I wouldn't put them as my first recommendation to anyone or include a tip with my pay."}
{"text":"Taste buds are satisfied. I had been hearing about this place for the longest. Since I had a sweet tooth carving I decided to give them a try. All I can say is that I am glad I did. Wow! What a donut. All I ordered was a 99 cent dozen mini glazed donuts through the drive-through. Lets say there was not even a crumb left by the time I got home. I am impressed. There are many different donuts available along with breakfast sandwiches. They offer meal deals and cafe style beverages for a nice price. I will be back..."}
{"text":"We love the apple fritters.  They are the best in Arizona!  
Very friendly staff. We even like the day old donuts."}
{"text":"You won't find better donuts anywhere, unless you go to another Bosa, which unfortunately people who appreciate a drive-through are starting to do. We have told them for almost a year now that there is a sinkhole in the side of the driveway that when you leave your tires fall into. It is about a 10 inch drop. It would take $50 worth of cold patch from home.depot to fix this problem but nobody fixes it. Alignment has been knocked so far out on my truck because of this hole and we have started going to another Bosa and when I do I see other people from this Bosa who have the same issue .  I don't know if it's a landlord tenant issue and they are fighting over who is responsible or what the delay is but this whole is getting bigger, and it is starting to give the impression that they just don't care."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best donuts I've ever had...in my life. Always fresh, always tasty. I am honestly a donut snob...and 99% of donuts pale in comparison to Bosa. From taste to density to price to all around deliciousness. The only complaint I have is that they're often \"out\" of things."}
{"text":"Sometimes I really like Bosa donuts and other times not. I've been to locations on Country Club, Williams Field and Signal Butte; sometimes they taste great and other times have an odd, greasy aftertaste and/or a strange synthetic taste to the frostings. I've noticed this inconsistency between locations and at times within the same location.

When they're great  they're great but after several hit-or-miss experiences, I am changing my rating from 4 stars to 2--though if I could I'd probably make it 2.5."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches up until recently they started using less meat now I just noticed they are charging more. Now your getting less of a sandwich and paying more for it.... no good Bosa no good :( all good things come to an end. Just spent five bucks on this thing and I'm still hungry"}
{"text":"Pretty not bad!  I will definitely patron this establishment again in the future."}
{"text":"Great donuts as I have mentioned before but employees are constantly a hit and miss. I got my overcharged resolved through my credit card but am disappointed that I never heard from Bosa. Still highly recommend the donuts."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Great donuts and Thai iced tea. Facilities also kept clean and organized. Parking lot can get very busy and congested later in the day."}
{"text":"Bosa Donuts on Dobson is fantastic. They have such a great selection of donuts and the prices are great. 

My husband loves the Boston Creme donut. The donuts are a good size. The chocolate frosting is sweet and hits the spot. The creme in the middle is well dispersed and has a great flavor. 

I prefer cake donuts. The ones at Bosa aren't super greasy. You can taste the donut instead of the grease. The maple long johns are also fantastic. 

I would give them 5-stars, but recently when we visit they have sold out of several of the flavors we wanted."}
{"text":"Best local donuts in Chandler.  Wide variety and quick service.  Must try local place."}
{"text":"Super fast and gummy. Good deal on the munchkins. They were super busy but well stocked."}
{"text":"Donuts are good.....but beware of staff.  I went in twice & asked for a \"plain\" donut & both times I got home to find \"berries\" inside of my \"plain\" donuts!!  Love to get home & not have what you ordered, especially when I asked THREE times.  I decided to go back to get the \"right\" donuts & was greeted by the same employee that just looked at me with confusion in her eyes....might not understand the language, but replaced the donuts & pushed a trash can over to me to throw the other donuts away with HER BARE FEET!! Yes, she had no shoes on behind the counter.  Is that not some sort of a health issue.  Nonetheless, I will never return.  The search continues for the perfect donut!"}
{"text":"Another Great Boss discovered. Yelp helped again. Very Clean. Very Good Assortment Still at 9am. So fresh So Soft So Gooood. Restrooms Very Clean too. Have found 5 different Bosa's around. All Great. Coffee Excellent. Service Excelent. Who need Dunkin. I can't take Starbucks Coffee. Bosa is Very Good. Who needs Dunkin with lots of Bosa's around the Valley. Thanks"}
{"text":"Went here for the \"little puffs of heaven\" and the \"chocolate wheeler\" as mentioned by other Yelpers, found an old fashioned chocolate covered donut that looked like a wheel but the girl behind the counter said they didn't really have names. These are definitely good donuts and almost ate all 12 donuts in one sitting just to make sure. Didn't get the little donuts this time but figured I'd be back."}
{"text":"I've been going to Bosa Donuts since I was just a kid! I don't think anyone can beat their donuts! Krispy Kreme Who? They now have lots of drink options, smoothies, sandwiches... you name it! I love that they have a drive thru, as usually an early morning donut run means we are still in our pjs!"}
{"text":"5 star worthy donut makers of Scottsdale. Found this place when a family member had late night sugar craving for a flour & sugar combination to create a delicious mouth watering taste bud sensations. What I didn't know before biting into the creation was how flipping amazing these donuts were gonna be. You be the judge and buy some to find out.

Now as you walk in there a case filled with dozens  & dozens of donut's to choose. I grabbed the white frosted with multi colored jimmy's on top. Plus a few maple bars which is my go to treat anywhere. My guest grabbed the chocolate  with crushed peanuts donut + apple fritter. Absolutely  some fresh donuts and with that line of people coming in & out you can see why there fresh. 

Open 24hrs a day you can get a craving anytime and satisfaction will be guaranteed. FYI they have coffee yet I didn't grab a cup. Well, I'm gonna finish my last one so I'm out."}
{"text":"I was asked to pick up donuts for the office last week. Shortly after the request came more specifics about what to get. What the hell is a butter bar?! So I asked my co-workers where they get their donuts, cause the place I use to go doesn't make butter bars (that I am aware of). That's when I was told that the guy who use to get up in the wee hours of the morning to make the donuts was dead. My childhood favorite is no longer made in store. Hello Bosa Donuts!

My co-workers even told me which Bosa to go to. But they mentioned that it was always super busy. That's how I ended up at the McDowell location in south Scottsdale. This place was pretty busy too and the cars were lined up in the drive-thru at least five or six cars deep.

I'm glad I went inside! The girl who greeted me was in a great mood and very friendly. And you don't get all the aromas in the drive-thru. I chose the three donuts that were requested and let her fill the box with an assortment of her choosing. And I can confirm something I read in another review. A dozen donuts at Bosa cost me nine dollars and change!

Now I've tried the gourmet donuts (of the \"broken\" kind) and also enjoyed the donuts by the guys who specialize in like two varieties. The competition out there is good, but judging by the freshness, the quality, the variety and how quickly they disappeared once I got to work, Bosa Donuts is where I will be going from now on."}
{"text":"11/11/16 

Buttermilk donut is clearly the main reason to go to Bosa Donuts - hands down 5 stars. 

Donut holes - 1 star, if that. A grocery store donut hole is better.  

Mango smoothie with Boba - mango smoothie alone 3 1/2 stars. The boba is gross, the texture is disgusting. 
This is ONLY my 2nd time having Boba, my first experience was AMAZING from JT Boba house in Avondale. 

To sum up my experience I will ONLY order the buttermilk donuts from now on!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here a few days after they opened to check it out with my cousin. The donuts were alright. Nothing extraordinary about them.

I saw a sign that said, \"We do boba tea\" so I asked the girl what kind of teas came with boba. She said,

\"We can put boba in any of our teas.\"

So I asked her, \"What kind of teas do you have?\" since that part of the menu wasn't up yet. She replied,

\"Any kind of tea we have can have boba.\"

I tried to repeat my question and ask her what kinds of teas they had and she just didn't understand me. She just kept saying, \"WE CAN PUT BOBA IN ANY OF OUR TEAS\"

She spoke english fine and didn't appear to have any trouble hearing so I have no idea what her problem was. I'll stick to Dunkin."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fully stocked fresh donuts every time you visit and friendlier service than the comp. 

Theresa's not much more to report than the cinnamon rolls are better than ever! Lots of cinnamon and plenty big enough to share."}
{"text":"Desperately needs more employees and more that can speak English fluently, when your sandwich is ready they kind of look at the tag and set it on the counter don't even announce its done, took another lady to come by to read it off. 

Place has a lot of potential I've always loved bosa, new location so we'll see how it gets organized in my next few visits."}
{"text":"The family and I have been coming here for over a year!  The donuts and boba drinks are just as good today, as they were on Day 1.  We have had some of their breakfast sandwiches and they are pretty good, too.  Pricing is pretty good and the customer service is awesome!  Our current favorites:  Boston Cream Donut, Blueberry Donut, and Thai Tea Boba Drinks"}
{"text":"I am addicted to the buttermilk donut, it's delicious and under $1. I've had a vanilla ice latte and it was really good. I ordered another one on a separate occasion and found out that they use half and half and don't have skim milk. Well, no wonder it was so good, but from here on not ordering the lattes because they only have half and half."}
{"text":"Talk at work had me checking this place out. Great selection, friendly staff, and quality product. Superior to dunkin' donuts, but for a plain glazed, a fresh, hot krispy kreme still rules."}
{"text":"Great value! I love the donut holes, they taste just like the center of a glazed donut and you can get a dozen for $1!!! How crazy is that?! The scent in the shop will make you never want to leave!"}
{"text":"The donuts are amazing but the mango smoothie I had today was delish! Will be going a lot more!"}
{"text":"The donuts where ok.  I was excited when I saw that they had shaved ice and boba.  I don't care much for boba, but my daughter loves it, so it was nice to bring it home to her.  

The shaved ice tasted more like plain ice.  I asked for all of the flavors...you know, rainbow!  The shaved ice barely had any color to it at all.  The worker said it didn't have much color because we used more than one flavor.  I doubt that to be the case.  It had no flavor.  I wouldn't try again."}
{"text":"THEY HAVE THE RUDEST STAFF I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED. from the rest of these comments i am not the only one to notice how horrible their employees are. if you hate helping people then get out of the service industry."}
{"text":"No big deal,
Glad they're open 24/7, makes it very convenient. However I have had much better donuts. Workers are very nice. With that said, donuts weren't that good. They were kinda of dried up, and almost like they were over a day old. Maybe it was just a bad day, and might try them again at a later time."}
{"text":"I am never getting donuts from anywhere else. Absolutely delicious!! I wondered why they built this directly across from Dunkin Donuts and worry about their success. Now, I understand. They are by far superior in taste and better in freshness, selection and price."}
{"text":"The donuts were too heavy. Not light and fluffy. Like they good quality donuts should be. Cream was running and not of good consistency, and a little stingy in th centrr. I was disappointed because they are close. And Not cheap!!!"}
{"text":"Don't go to any other place in the valley. Seriously. This is the ONLY donut shop I'll ever go to. The best donuts, great selection + a drive thru!"}
{"text":"Every other morning I try to come to this place as much as I can. 

It's only about a mile away from me every morning I need a fresh cup of they're house coffee and croissant breakfast sandwich cheese and sausage the croissant itself made just right crispy / soft and flakey 


Bosa Donuts always make it fresh and ready to go. 

If you want a quick , fast , to-go or dine-in breakfast Bosa Donuts has it covered . 

Come on and try it.. best in the area"}
{"text":"Let's get something straight.... I'm not really a donut person. I don't mind an occasional donut with the right company. But for the most part, I don't care about donuts. However....

For some reason, I was recently craving a donut. Maybe there's something in the Phoenix water that makes me do that. I'm not sure. Anyway, I was getting some work done at a nearby cafe and decided to look for a donut shop. Thank you fellow yelpers for introducing me to this little gem. The donuts are super cheap and really yummy. I've been here multiple times and usually opt for the buttermilk bar. Tip: The buttermilk bars at this location are tastier and bigger than the ones at the Tempe location. I've had the chocolate cruller and that one is yummy too.

Considering I'm not much of a donut fan, I will admit that I crave them more since I found this place. If you're looking for an inexpensive yummy treat, I say give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I have been a patron, devoted customer, and all around confectionary fan boy for at least 10 years and am absolutely insulted by the service that i received today. Best donuts in town; no doubt. Best prices for this quality; undeniably. Best example of poor service; since 2015. After buying my regular fix of 18 donuts and a blended thai ice tea w boba i received thai ice tea in regular ice. I requested to have my order corrected and the woman was unwilling to fulfill my order after I had already paid . i could have demanded to have my money refunded, but i decided to enjoy my  LAST taste of bosa since i drive 8 miles out of my way. No worries. The woman chose to save 3 minutes of her busy schedule instead of keeping a customer who has chosen to $upport this business 1-2 x a wk for the past decade. I don't care if the dough is made with water from shangri la and makes you want to breakdance, if I'm not respected as a customer, I'll go elsewhere!!"}
{"text":"BEST donuts around. The only think lacking is the customer service. None of the employees are very friendly. 

....but seriously, most delicious donuts."}
{"text":"When I think about this pkace, of course a smile comes over my face.  They are like family warm friendly.  Of course the product is delicious fresh n yummy.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Get doughnuts from the QT up the street, they are fresher, cheaper, and faster."}
{"text":"I walked in at 5am to get our 3 dozen donuts this morning. As I walked in an employee was standing over donuts coughing with her mouth wide open. When she noticed me she turned around and,continued to cough and then she wiped her mouth with her hand. I just told her never mind and turned and walked out. Come on people, have better manners or don't come to work,sick. You even looked sick."}
{"text":"Love this little charming place! My hubby had used the drive-thru before, and the donuts he brought home were delish! Better than Dunkin. 
So today I have work to catch up on, so Bosa Donuts is my new office. Lots of tablespace, quiet environment, and yes free WiFi. The staff are extra friendly, the lady who took my order-really sweet. Had a chocolate frosted donut that was fresh and fluffy. Being a coffee connoisseur, I was impressed with the iced coffe, Irish Cream. Great flavor, not bitter, yet strong enough to get you over the afternoon sleepys. Definitely will be returning to this little gem for my caffeine fix and a sweet treat!"}
{"text":"Great clean environment, nice drinks I happen to love their thai tea and tuna crossaint sandwiches. The sandwich was huge with crisp pickles, lettuce, tomato and swiss cheese. The thai tea was extra cold and creamy."}
{"text":"Great place to get a hot and fresh donut at midnight!

The drive through was a little confusing and we had to pull up to the window to order, but man, the donuts here are super fresh and tasted so good.  Definitely going to be coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Passing through town in the morning & craving donuts during a long road trip.  What do my fellow yelpers have to say about Chandler, AZ options? Wow!  Bosa Donuts has tons of reviews and has maintained 4.5 stars. Hmm, must be good. C'mon Bessie, let's get a move on.  Cool, open 24/7 and has a drive-thru. Got my favorite donut, crullers! Yes! Now taste test... UGHHH!  What IS this?  Rubbery, chewy crullers @ 7am?!?!?  On a weekday?!?!?  How old are these donuts?!?  Krispy Kreme-ish?  I think not!  Not the kind of experience I was hoping for."}
{"text":"Where are all these good reviews coming from? My boyfriend and I LOVE donuts but this place doesn't do the trick. We've been here twice, I decided not to write a review the first visit incase it was a fluke but alas.. Flavorless donuts. Lemon, Boston cream, and maple (how does maple get messed up?!?) all very subpar.
The only good thing is the price.

Better off going to Circle K."}
{"text":"Donuts are a staple of life and Bosa's is where one goes when the craving calls in East Phoenix.  Stay with the cake donuts and the crullers."}
{"text":"Honestly, I love Bosa.  I'm a pretty regular customer, and their food is always excellent no matter my order.  I'm a huge fan of their original glazed donuts and their Thai iced tea, though I've been nothing short of delighted as I've been branching out recently.

My problem with this Bosa is the customer service.  I have repeatedly been given the wrong items, overcharged, and ignored in the drive through, and it's enough to leave a sour taste in my mouth despite the excellent food."}
{"text":"Despite living nearly next door to a Dunkin Donuts I had to make the drive to Bosa Donuts. 

Not wanting to get out of the car in my slippers and pajama pants we used the drive-thru. The menu was difficult to see because the plastic cover on the display was sun burned and blurry. We ordered some classics knowing there was no way they couldn't have them.

The maple long john was delicious. I haven't seen maple long johns at Dunkin Donuts in a long time so I was loving it. The chocolate frosting could be better but I can't complain too much about chocolate frosting... I mean, come on, it's chocolate frosting! My friend wasn't impressed with the apple fritter. It was crunchy and too sugary. 

Here's the kicker. The basic glazed doughnut was amazing. It was so close to a Krispy Kreme doughnut you could have fooled me in a blind taste test. It was perfectly glazed and collapsed just like the best of the best upon first bite.

Next time I have a doughnut craving I will skip the neighborhood Dunkin and ride over to Bosa."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of donuts. These rank high on my list!  Wow!  We tried a lemon filled, a Boston cream, a yellow cake with chocolate icing and a maple bar. Each bite was better than the last. It was worth the 2 mile walk!  The price was quite low.  The coffee was delicious. The environment was clean and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Alright. I feel that my first review was a bit unfair. I went back last weekend for a coffee and a donut.. and I must say, the donut was pretty good. I think the first time I went I was a bad donut picker. 

I plan on returning!"}
{"text":"My guilty pleasure. Yes, donuts are absolutely horrible for you (nothing but sugar and fat) but they taste sooooo good (nom). Forget the Krispy Krap, their glaze is so sugary it gives me a toothache/headache and they are overrated in flavor.  Bosa delivers with flavor and a small (regional) chain charm.  I go for the traditional twists, so soft and fun to pull apart in fluffy pieces. But they have a number of great traditional and \"fancy\" jelly, sprinkle, chunky donuts.  Bonus, drinks with Boba!  I'm not big on coffee, but it tasted ok to me.  Warm and not burnt tasting.  Of course, I've been ruined by S'bux so take it with a grain of salt. 

This location is in a nice transitional area on edge of Arcadia.  I really appreciate the drive-thru for quick fixes.  But if you have the time, it is nice to go in an see the whole selection in the display windows. I've never had an issue with speed or service, though i've visited at different hours."}
{"text":"Great service clean restaurant and 24 hour drive thru donuts were fresh and love the boba"}
{"text":"I've said it before and will say it again: BoSa is like crack in a box...you just can't get enough!

This store is nice, but much smaller in comparison to the location on Baseline and Mill here in Tempe. This one happens to be located in a small strip mall next door to the Jack In The Box on Ray Road, just down the street from the I-10 Freeway. 

This place is definitely hopping, as I witnessed this myself the day I went in. I got what I needed within 5 minutes' time, and the girl at the register recognized me from the Southern and McClintock location. 

Very friendly and hardworking people run these donut shops and they always have a smile on their faces, even in times when it's crazy packed with people! Their donuts are always fresh and delicious as well.

Also, this store offers free Wi-Fi, so feel free to have coffee and a donut, and play on your smartphone while visiting the shop."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place and can't get enough of it! I've become a regular it seems and their employees are always happy to see me. Very friendly and helpful, they make the experience well worth the while...and of course, the donuts speak for themselves. As I can attest to, they're like crack in a box! Once you have one, you can't help but want more!

This store is always very clean and well-maintained. Also, they offer free wi-fi so enjoy surfing the net while dining in their restaurant or just ordering donuts to go. 

They also offer a variety of drinks to try. I will have to have one sometime on a future visit!

I HIGHLY recommend dropping by this location and see what I mean!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and enjoy coming back, as they always have a vast selection of donuts and really good service. Plus the location is on my way both to and from work and home so no complaints there!

Glad that this location has a drive-thru so no leaving the car is necessary unless we feel the urge to physically go in and order.

BoSa has THE BEST donuts around!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I make a special trip when I visit in town from Portland. The donuts taste so fresh!"}
{"text":"The choices of donuts are pretty exemplary. The texture and taste of the donuts are springy and not overly sweet. However, I would not go out of my way to get these donuts. Maybe it's because I'm from LA where we have more donuts choices in one place than some stores have chairs. As I'm eating this, I would say these donuts are better than your local grocery store's donuts but is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"HOLY MOLY! 

My once a year donut cravings now have a home! A dozen donut holes for 99 cents? Shut up.... This is no joke. Plus its open 24/7- this could get dangerous since its only two blocks away from home. 

We got two of the normal donuts too. My boyfriend got a vanilla frosted one with sprinkles and I got a strawberry glazed one with pink sprinkles! yummmmmy! I am excited mostly because I feel like fried airy dough should be cheap, and obviously Bosa gets that. Reasonable prices, yummy, and there when you need it. Thanks for being so supportive, Bosa!"}
{"text":"A short review is in order here because after all we are talking about freakin donuts.  However, in AZ there are no good donut shops for the most part.  We had three donuts - glazed, chocolate long john, and a chocolate old fashioned/sour cream.  The last was a bit stale.  The first two were great.  We will go back.  Nice little place and it's open 24 hours."}
{"text":"This could have been a 5 star review but the donuts I bought for my co workers today had no filling. No lemon filling no Boston creme filling. Embarrassing and disappointing. When I called to complain I am afraid I could not really understand the person I talked to. Something about new employees. 
So gave Bosa a second chance and asked twice \" are you sure donuts are filled\" explained what happened to me last time. Get to work and OMG no filling again. I am done with this place."}
{"text":"New location.  But it's still Bosa.  Very good donuts.  Don't kid yourself that these things are healthy, because they aren't.  But they are really good!

Like other Bosas they have boba drinks and coffee and tea, and some breakfast sandwiches.

Bosa is my preferred donut joint when i decide I'm going to be unhealthy for a day."}
{"text":"Bosa Donuts is absolutely my favorite donut chain in the valley. Their donuts are reasonably priced and drive thru service is always prompt. Love the donut holes (cheap but still very delicious!). Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We walked in and we were hit by a wall of heat because this place was like 100F inside which was not very inviting but we saw the display of donuts and could not resist.

We each ordered what we wanted and the cashier was either learning what to do or completely forgot what she was doing because it took us forever to cash out....

Now to the important part the donuts.... I got the chocolate glazed and was told I needed to try the buttermilk so I got both. The chocolate glazed was delicious and it just melted in your mouth, but the buttermilk one was so thick that it was hard to eat and I could not even finish it and I did not think it was that good to be honest.

Overall a great place for donuts!"}
{"text":"If this BoSa is of the same as the one in Glendale, they are the best!  If it is the same, it is a family run facility and they make their donuts fresh several times"}
{"text":"Best doughnuts in Chandler. Fresh doughnuts made throughout the day. Every drink under the sun besides coffee."}
{"text":"To die for. These are so yummy. As a note its best - I mean best, if you get there right when they open. The fresh donuts is something to try if you haven't tried a \"just made\" donut. #ShopLocalBrands"}
{"text":"The greatest donut shop on the planet...and they are open 24 hours a day...so donuts at 5am before work, donuts for lunch, donuts for dinner, donuts after a drinkun night on the town. And the best bit of goodness you could ever have in your mouth. 

My favorite is the buttermilk donut, it literally melts in your mouth, a sugary crisp outside with a soft buttermilk flavor on the inside, perfection in a donut. 

Plus this place has breakfast sandwiches, and all kind of extras, more juice and drink selections then you could shake a stick at. 

Mmmmmmm....donuts."}
{"text":"Well, I am out and about real late and had always seen that they were open 24 hours. I had a coupon for one free donut and I also ordered one more. They didn't have any donuts that I would normally buy and the person at the drive through didn't seem to want to sell me any. I finally picked 2 chocolate cake with chocolate frosting . I paid and gave a dollar tip. I rolled to a parking spot and grabbed the first donut. My hand was filled with oil and the bite I took was filled with oil as well. So, my first impression was not very good. I'm sure there has good donuts there, you might want to not go there in the really late hours. My 2 donuts were horrific."}
{"text":"Easiest review ever. What not to like?  Lol.

1. Cheapest donuts around
2. Tons of Flavor!
3. Fresh from the oven!
4. Donuts holes 99 cents for a dozen. Drops mic...
5. Nice sales person.

That's it. No need for a long review. Yelp might not like it but hey! Who needs a long review for a great place like this! Just go in and get your donuts for the day!!!

Oh... fyi. Free wifi!"}
{"text":"I'm glad to see this establishment grow and quickly becoming my go to spot for a delicious vanilla iced coffee and donut! At first it was awful but only due to it recently opening its doors. Now that they are established, I thoroughly enjoy the quick drive thru, coffee, and all the donuts my heart desires. Orders are on spot for the most part. I can only point out that sometimes my iced coffee isn't consistent but it's still delicious. Donuts are always fresh unlike Dunkin Donuts across the street."}
{"text":"OMG the best donuts I've ever tasted.... and I live in Los Angeles.  My mom took me to this place years ago and I always make it a point to go here when I'm in town.  Sometimes she just buys a few dozen and has it ready for me.  I'm a world traveler and I really love their donuts.  I've had some pretty good donuts in New York but these are hands down my favorite.  I wish they had a store in Los Angeles.  Then again maybe not.  LOL  

Super soft and moist.  Not too sweet.  Kinda pricey now and I wish they had those free dozen deals again.  Buy 2 get 1 free.  I always end up spending over $30 here.  My sister has 4 kids and we go through 2 dozen in no time.

I love this place.  Come to LA please. :-)  Hell, let's open a joint here.  Yes, that's how good they are."}
{"text":"Love their donuts, always fresh and always open.  Great selection of donuts! They also are serving boba!!!  I come here for breakfast, lunch and sometimes even dinner!!!"}
{"text":"I blame Bosa for resurfacing my donut obsession. I thought all donuts tasted the same. I thought they all tasted fluffy, sugary and heavenly, but the same. I have been a lover of the donut since my early childhood when my Dad would surprise me with a stop at our favorite donut store during a round of errands. The owner also happened to know my Dad so my one donut turned into a full bag of donuts and I felt as if I had just won the jackpot (even though my Dad still only let me pick one out to actually eat at that moment). But now let me fast forward many, many moons and I'll actually begin my review of Bosa. 

Bosa does not sell your ordinary donut. Well, actually they do sell some of the classics but the difference with Bosa is that they make their donuts truly holey (pun intended). Whatever they do to them makes the donut victim enter a world of pure oblivion as an sugar high hits instantly upon first delicious bite. 

So you go to Bosa for the first time, you walk into a very sparse shop that was definitely once a fast food restaurant and you see a counter of donuts staring at you. Like my Dad taught me all those years ago, sadly I can only have one, so what to do? The answer is easy, even for someone with major menu anxiety like myself: get the BUTTERMILK donut. Don't ask questions and just do it. Don't think to yourself...\"that's way too big, I'll just get a donut hole.\" No. Order the buttermilk donut, have a serious talk with your will power, tell your will power to hold you back from eating the entire thing and get the buttermilk donut. Why? Because it will allow you to taste a donut you didn't know existed. It tastes like pure buttermilk immersed into a delicious fried sweet baked good. You'd think the bread inside would taste like normal donut bread, but it doesn't. It tastes like your eating donut bread infused with buttermilk cream and yet it's just the donut being that fluffy and moist. Now thanks to this donut, I will have to avoid driving on McDowell until I allow myself to have a donut again because I know that if I pass by Bosa (that has a DRIVE THROUGH by the way), there is no way I'll be able to drive by without stopping inside to say hello to my favorite donut."}
{"text":"best donuts ever. these ruin all other donuts for me. plus you can't beat the drive thru open 24 hours! not much atmosphere inside, but that kind of makes it feel like your super local, hidden gem donut place."}
{"text":"I love there Donuts so fresh & fluffy. So glad they opened one on this side of town conveniently located near work. Also inside is huge high ceilings. 

I've tried other BOSA donuts around town this is by far the better I guess it takes skills to fry the perfect donut and mixing the dough. 

High Five to the baker! Great Baker = Great Donuts this place delivered!"}
{"text":"Disappointed! We have been to other Bosa locations, and this one is definitely not great! The donuts we purchased were stale, like they were selling them from a day or so
ago. And the girl behind the counter barely spoke English. We will just drive a little further down the road to Krispy Kreme!"}
{"text":"Nice Spot For Coffee and Treats

And as I was driving by today I realized I hadn't had anything to eat all day and it was 5:00 PM. I stopped in grabbed a custard filled chocolate doughnut and ice blended coffee.

I was greeted very politely by the lady that was working behind the counter. She took my order and made my coffee and I went and sat down to have my treat.

I must admit the iced blended mocha coffee drink was actually quite good. The price was reasonable as well. It was full of flavor and I left with a good happy stomach.

The doughnut was tasty and fresh, and well I do not normally eat much in the way of sweets, it was a nice little treat to have.

Stop into this nice little quiet tree shop have a seat, have a snack, and have a good conversation with some friends if you bring them with you."}
{"text":"A wide variety of flavors, cheap prices and convenient location. The doughnuts are a bit on the bland side, but decent enough to satisfy cravings. The staff is friendly, the atmosphere clean enough  - a delightful stop."}
{"text":"Today was the first time trying this place. It's a quaint little donut shop with traditional donuts. They have a drive thru so you can just go with pjs on and no one knows. 
We were going to order 4 donuts but it was cheaper to get a half dozen. 
We ordered 2 cinnamon rolls, 2 glazed donuts, a chocolate glazed donut, and the long chocolate donut thingy.
We went there at 11... and the donuts were still incredibly fresh. Anyone who's had donuts, know that most donuts become stale after about 2 hours. So this was a pleasant surprise. I had the cinnamon roll which was delicious; not too much cinnamon which I tend to find is a typical problem. 
Im having to restrain myself from eating another donut so I don't feel like a fat a**. 
Will definitely return. Why go to Dunkin Donuts, which isn't as good and is a chain, when we should support our local spots!"}
{"text":"Best donuts I've ever had. I tried every single one we got. The donuts are very soft and well made. $6 for 6 donuts, great price!"}
{"text":"Best coffee ever! If you are looking for a good, no frills, no pumpkin spice, no cafe mocha stuff just a hot cup of joe this is your place. Cream and sugar keeps it simple. And it's 4 x's cheaper than Starbucks  nice ladies that work inside too they always seem to make me a fresh cup of coffee and if it's not well it seems like it !"}
{"text":"The donuts here are delicious ! They are freshly made and even have a drive through which makes this place even better! I went in last night to get a half a dozen and it was only $5 ! I think a dozen was like $8 or $9 but the prices are so worth it since they are amazing donuts ! Totally recommend and am planning on coming back !"}
{"text":"Delicious donuts for a late night snack. Customer service was great. Plus it's open 24/7."}
{"text":"The donuts are great!! My favorite donuts but I will never return to this location because of the customer service. The lady at the counter was super rude. Almost made me feel as if I was nothing compared to her. Sadly I will truly never return"}
{"text":"This place is evil... in a good way.  The donuts are light with a sweetness but not overly so.  The donuts are far better than the dry bricks at Dunkin Donuts.  They are at least on par with Krispy Kremes. 

I come here often when I don't mind feeling guilty for a sweet fix."}
{"text":"Avoid the taro milk tea. It is overly sweet. The apple fritter could use more apples, but it is nicely flavored."}
{"text":"Great service. A little pricey but there was a great selection even at 8pm. The donuts taste great and the building was clean."}
{"text":"Other than at grocery stores, it's becoming more and more difficult to find a simple, decent donut shop. And for some strange reason, there aren't any Dunkin Donuts in Chandler or Gilbert (can someone explain this phenomena to me?).  I know, for donut purists out there, Dunkin Donuts is just another corporate chain.  But I happen to think their donuts and coffee are pretty tasty!  That said, Bosa Donuts is nice alternative.  It's a small shop with a good variety of freshly made donuts.  I especially liked the chocolate frosted cake donuts.  They were really good.  The coffee was ok, let's say... better than \"breakroom\" coffee.  Located just north of the Downtown Chandler area, Bosa Donuts has both walk-in and drive-thru service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week."}
{"text":"This donut place is 24/7. It's clean and convenient. The donuts were fair. I've had better BUT the buttermilk donut is worth the visit. If you're going to make you're way there make sure to get a buttermilk. It's like a cross between a biscuit and donut. So fun and yummy! Donuts are .85 cents as well"}
{"text":"Fresh tasting donuts and they're open 24 hours probably the best place i've found to get some good donuts there glazed and cinnamon crumb were delicious would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Food was terrible and service was terrible. Ham and cheese croissant was cold and greasy and the coffee was cold. Went through the drive through and asked for a chocolate cake glazed donut and you would think it was some rare form of donut. I had to explain it three times. This location is crap. Go to the one on Indian School."}
{"text":"They have boba! I have been searching the valley for a bubble tea place and someone told me that Bosa has it. I had the Thai tea with boba and it was delicious. I do miss my boba being in a sealed cup but happy to have found a boba place in the Valley.

Also, had the chance to try a donut hole and it was yummy. I'll definitely be going back here to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I am in love with your chocolate frosted cake donuts. There I said it. See u next week."}
{"text":"Sigh.  This morning I'm a sad panda.  This location is on my way to work, so occasionally I'll stop for a coffee and a maple bar.  Today, I was feeling savory - so I went with a bagel breakfast sandwich.  Do not, under any circumstances make this mistake.  It's partially my own fault.  I don't order buffalo wings at Quizno's, I don't get potstickers at In n' Out - but since I've never had a bad item at this place, I figured why not?

I'll tell you why.  Bagel = dry / flavorless.  Eggs = un-seasoned.  Bacon = under-cooked and only ONE piece folded in half FOR AN ENTIRE SANDWICH?!?!  On top of that, no sauce / mayo / spread / schmear a.k.a. NOTHING to make up for the fail that was this morning's attempt at sustinence.

I digress.  The maple bars are always spot on, the old fashioned cake doughnuts are money - even their coffee is consistent - so I guess what I'm saying is, don't get a sandwich at a donut shop.  The end."}
{"text":"Very happy my favorite donut place opened up right on my way to work. I have a new love for their crossiant breakfast sandwhiches. After a fun night out...these help to start the morning."}
{"text":"4 stars for the Buttermilk Bar, 2-3 stars for the Original Glazed Donut and Apple Fritter. 
I came in on a Sunday before heading to the airport, and it was empty at 4:30pm. The donuts didn't look that appetizing in the case, but we figured we had to at least try them since we were already there. I ended up purchasing a dozen to bring back for my co-workers ($7-$8, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bosa-donuts-scottsdale?select=644Utn9Y4lqV4i5K6pD3pw#644Utn9Y4lqV4i5K6pD3pw), and we tried:

-Original Glazed Donut (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bosa-donuts-scottsdale?select=644Utn9Y4lqV4i5K6pD3pw#BI5rlLME1mQCFE3M0iw8pw): Pretty decent. Definitely nowhere close to the best glazed donut I've ever had, but it was a good donut. Not as fluffy as I'd like but at least it wasn't super sweet.
-Apple Fritter: Eh.. skip! There was too much cinnamon flavor or something, and I didn't like this version of the apple fritter at all.
-Buttermilk Bar: The best out of the three! I normally don't get buttermilk bars, but wanted to try it since it got such good reviews, and I wasn't disappointed! I loved the crispyness of the outside and the glaze. It was a little on the sweet side, but not too bad. Highly recommended! They also have a chocolate covered buttermilk bar but apparently those sell out early.

Although it says \"Best Donuts in Town\" on the Bosa Donut box, don't have too high of expectations. At least the lady who was working here was really nice and parking was plentiful. They also have boba drinks available and shaved ice if you're looking for something other than donuts."}
{"text":"One of the best places to grab a donut. Drive thru is quick and easy and never seen the dine-in full. The staff are usually nice but it's a hit or miss sometimes. My favorite thing to get is the chocolate long john."}
{"text":"So... My boyfriend and I found this place as one of the few (if not only) donut spots in Phoenix that's open 24/7. After he had a craving for donuts at 1AM, it had good reviews, and I saw on yelp that they served boba there, we decided to give it a go. When we got there, he first ordered a boba for me and began his dozen donuts order. The donuts he wanted (namely chocolate... Simple to make you would think) was not available at 1AM. He then asked for another type of donut (Boston cream)... Not available. Only ones they said they had at that time of night was glazed, raspberry filled, and lemon filled. He declined the donuts altogether because he was frustreated with continually getting \"sorry, we don't have that\".

I gave this place a one star on his behalf and because I had my boba drink and it was descent, however, nowhere near the best I've tasted. I like my boba squishy and not too rough to chew. I tried boba at this one Viet restaraunt that was better but that's another yelp review in the making.

Overall, case and point: we may have been better off going there earlier in the day and their selection seems to be EXTREMELY limited after typical business hours. If your business is said to be open 24 hours AND you're one of the only open available donut shops in the area that never close, PLEASE have a majority of your donut selection available around the clock. Thank you for reading this rant."}
{"text":"Wow I usually love Bosa donuts. I've been too many others around the valley and never had a problem. BUT, this Bosa donuts is horrible. Every single Time I've come here there's been an issue except for the first time which was the grand opening. So first off let me say that this is a new location. So typically I know there's going to be new employees. But I don't know how their hiring process works but they don't train their new employees very well. I've come in the past 2 times and asked for a drink that they messed up on. First time was a smoothie with boba the guy that was working didn't know how to make smoothies (go figure) so when I got my boba smoothie it was really runny almost like a melted milkshake. So I gave them the benefit of the doubt and I felt bad so I still got the drink didn't complain and I decided to give them another chance. I go in tonight and ask for a donut and a sandwich she makes the sandwich with an attitude then I ask for a  really simple drink a Thai tea with boba. Super simple. They even have the Thai tea pre made in the refrigerator so all she had to do was put the cream in and she has to go ask the Asian man in the back and then forgets to put boba and seals the drink. Like wow your job isn't that hard. So idk if it's the employee to blame or their just not training their employees good. Super irritated and upset though because I only come here for the boba smoothies and a donut.  I just left with my sandwich and no drink. So if your looking forward to anything with boba you better be prepared for a hassle."}
{"text":"Great donuts but don't get a smoothie- it's made from some powder and ice not real fruit"}
{"text":"This is a great donut and the best Bosa location in town!!! Do NOT goto Gilbert location on Williams Field, at least not after 9pm or before 5am because they won't have donuts and sell you two day olds out of the trash! This happened to me 3am at Gilbert one and was responded back by a rude, nasty blondish woman who told me I should have came after 4:30am. That's why Chandler location on Arizona Ave is the only one should goto because they ALWAYS have fresh donuts available. The don't try to sell you ones from the trash."}
{"text":"BoSa Donuts rock my world, Apple Fritters and Twist are my favorites. This location is near my job and stop on my way into work when I am feeling generous. I have had their donuts stay fresh in the box the whole day into the next day, you cannot go wrong with a BoSA $6.99 dozen."}
{"text":"Great place to get donuts for the office. My office really likes the glazed donuts holes. Inside the place is pretty plain but it's a donut shop. You come here for the donuts. They serve lunch foods too but I haven't tried them. Keep an eye out for specials and coupons."}
{"text":"Bosa Donuts are the bomb!!!! I just had to stop by given I was in the area and I sure wish they had one in Goodyear. I was surprised the selection they still had on a late Saturday afternoon. I ordered my usual icing filled and it was great as always.  My wife hung out in the car waiting and I was nice enough to share a little with her. I know, I am such a kind soul. Anyway, I love Bosa Donuts and if your wondering why four stars only; this location does not have fountain drinks. I was able to purchase a diet coke bottle but was looking for the fountain action.  Yes, I know, diet coke with my donut. You have to draw the line somewhere.  Overall, their donuts never disappoint and are so good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are self proclaimed donut connoisseurs and we LOVE Bosa donuts.  The fact that it's open 24 hrs a day for all of our donut needs is fabulous and the donuts are always fresh and amazing!"}
{"text":"Well bosa doughnuts are the doughnuts of my youth. I never seen a Dunkin  doghnut shop or a krispy cream only bosa...but when I was teenager they all went away and then there reappeared Dunkin.. But what ever franchise a fresh doughnut is a little piece of paradise.. But one for me stands out above all and only bosa makes them that I'm aware of .. The butterfly!!! Omg and no I didn't say OTG..ha . so my doughnut money is going to bosa... However the customer service is something to be improved . and the promotion of the sales of the franchise could try harder and at least set a proper foundation to make record breaking sales with the corporate butterfly"}
{"text":"So to go along with the crowd, I decide to go to Bosa donuts this morning an give them a try. For starters, the drive-thru is very convenient and I didn't even know it existed. Secondly, I have to agree with previous reviews, these have to be the best donuts I have ever tried anywhere. They are HUGE and easily a meal in one. If you put dunkin and Krispy creme together, they still couldn't pull this off. When the box states \"Best donuts in AZ\" I can believe it. Unfortunately I also have to agree with the fact that staff is rather unfriendly. That in and of itself loses 2 stars, and it's a good thing that the donuts are tasty or else I wouldn't consider coming back. This will definitely be a special treat to take to work, but otherwise I won't be going back regularly."}
{"text":"Too bad it's not 24 hours. They should make it that way like the other location.

Well, this location seems more decorated or at least better than the other locations. I like how it's more clean and whatnot. Awesome drinks and donuts here. You can get donut holes too and I think I saw sandwich menu on the board.

Good place to hang out with free wifi. Grab donuts and drinks if you get hungry. Although the other thing is I notice a lot of random homeless people around or that comes onto the patio to ask for money or cigarettes.

Other than that, it's a pretty decent location if you just need a drink and a donut."}
{"text":"I stopped by one morning to pick up a dozen donuts before work. I like the variety that they have -- it's pretty standard and doesn't feel like an infinite amount of options. The cashier was also very nice. He answered any questions I had about fillings, toppings, etc. and was very patient while I was choosing (it's so hard to make up my mind sometimes!). They may not be \"artisanal\" doughnuts, but they are my favourite. Throughout the day, I could not help but eat a second one. Since they are lighter than most other doughnuts, I didn't feel quite as guilty!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I like to visit here to grab thai iced tea and donuts. The donuts are okay, but I am not a fan of the thai iced tea. The boba usually comes out hard, and it is also an extremely expensive drink (~$5.50 before tax). We typically ask for no ice because they tend to put a large amount of ice in. Today we were told that asking for no ice would be an up-charge of 25 cents. That's just completely ridiculous. If something is advertised as a 24 oz drink, it is a completely reasonable request to ask for no ice. I have never had a restaurant turn down that request. We won't be returning to Bosa until they decide that a few ounces of tea is worth keeping repeat customers around."}
{"text":"I recommend this place to anyone who wants a amazing fluffy doughnut for their start of the morning. Very friendly staff that loves what they do and are very hardworking. The chocolate sprinkles used to be my favorite but now I can't pick only one to have and have a Boston cream with it. A++++"}
{"text":"These are by far the best donuts in the valley.  I have one complaint-they aren't closer to my house!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love BoSa donuts. They are so moist, sweet, and delicious. I've never had a donut from there that wasn't excellent but the buttermilk bar and the old fashioned glazed are my favorites. I love that they're open late for those of us who crave donuts at all hours."}
{"text":"Bosa was just alright. I got an old fashioned and a smoothie. The donut was good, nothing outstanding. I'd go back for one, I just wish they had a few more varieties. The smoothie tasted like completely fake fruit, way too sweet. Would not get the smoothie again. I may be back, but not before I try other places."}
{"text":"These donuts are bomb and cheap. Easy place to get some quick, delicious donuts. And this location is open 24 hours. Their page says only till 10 pm but it is open 24/7."}
{"text":"They make the worse dozen choices. They're basically all the same donut. Besides they didn't even ask what kind I wanted."}
{"text":"Delicious! Loved the option of ordering a Thai Tea with my donut. Friendly staff too. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Oh my god today I decided to try Bosa donuts and I got a buttermilk donut today with a Thai tea with boba and now I am addicted. I was shocked to see that you can get 1 dozen donut holes for .99 cents. My coworkers will love me on Friday."}
{"text":"Yum yum yummmm...buttermilk donut 
Honeydew Smoothie 
BEC Croissant  
Black Coffee
Loved this place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"5 stars hands down. Amazing donuts and great customer service. Their thai iced tea was the first thai iced tea I've tried but was interesting to taste but was delicious. Has a cool after taste.

Must try at least once. Be careful, could be addicting!"}
{"text":"Their donuts are awesome :) and that's not necessarily a good thing when I live and work less than a mile away!  The drive through is fast and easy and the people that work there all seem very nice and helpful.  Bonus points for having Thai iced tea."}
{"text":"Hell to the yes.

These little bundles of dough melt in your mouth. Well, they aren't all little.
The old fashioned and regular glazed were fantastic! Did not taste greasy or over fried.

This location is pretty no frills but it's super cheap and pretty quick to order. They have a drive thru but I bet waiting in line is faster.

They did have some fancy donuts like bacon and maple glazed but I just wanted something simple--no regrets!

I think we got 4 donuts for under $3"}
{"text":"I am a donut lover, for sure and as such, I've eaten at a LOT of donut houses in many states over the years. BoSa's donuts are as good as the best donuts I've ever had; those old school, old fashioned-tasting donuts that are not only made fresh in-house, but are made WELL (not all in-house mom-and-pop donut shops are created equal). 

I've stopped here at all hours of all days and ordered just about every donut available at one time or another and they are always fresh, always yummy... I wish I could pack up BoSa and take them with me everywhere I move because great donut houses are extremely hard to find since the Krispy Kreme and Dunkin Donut franchise explosion.

Bottom Line: BoSa = delish donuts available 24/7."}
{"text":"Hey what can I say it's a donut shop but I will say there is a large variety of donuts to choose from the person I went to that helped me when I was at the store was very fast at putting my order together the donuts are actually very good I would compare them to Krispy Kreme."}
{"text":"I've been here on several occasions, always drive-thru and always have had a good experience. Today I went and had an even better experience. It's a Saturday night. 9pm. My husband and I ordered a dozen donuts. The donuts were ready in .5 seconds & tasted so fresh! I will be back.."}
{"text":"Great place to grab some cheap donuts. I went around the opening weekend. The donuts seemed really fresh. They were a little heavier than I prefer, but this is about the type of donuts one would expect from this type of shop."}
{"text":"Great apple fritter. I'm pretty sorry I didn't order more van-filled cuz that donut went down fast.   Staff was friendly and the prices more than reasonable.  A buck for donut holes -  heck yeah."}
{"text":"This Bosa is our go-to spot for \"donut day\" aka any day that I pick up donuts for my kids.

I'm here almost weekly as typically Saturday is \"donut day\" in our house.  I'm typically pretty good and stay away from the donuts myself, but every now and then I give in to a bite and then forget about it... I become a donut-a-holic and can't stop!

You can't go wrong with whatever your donut preference is from vanilla or chocolate sprinkles, old fashioned, glazed, or so many others.  The donut holes are delicious and a great bang for your buck!

Bosa does donuts well and consistently, and the added bonus is that they have a drive thru window and they are open from 5am - 10pm daily.  But \"do-nut\" take my word for it... check it out for yourself!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"They're amazing!! They almost always toss an extra donut in for free. That's a good donut place. And I love their Boston creme filled donuts."}
{"text":"Stopped in to try the Thai tea with boba.  It was disgusting.  The boba tasted like it was a few days old.  It was not sweet like other Thai teas.  I didn't get a doughnut but they looked good. Next time will try the doughnuts only and give an updated review.  Wish they made the bobas fresh."}
{"text":"This is a horrible location they do not open at a reasonable time it is 9 o'clock in the morning now they are not open. They do not listen when they take your order and they messed up your order every single time. And then have the nerve to ask for a tip at the end of the transaction. I do not recommend this place to anybody whatsoever."}
{"text":"The best donuts in town, hands down!! Their breakfast sandwiches however, are awful...the nuke these packets of already ready eggs and bacon and put them in the croissant but the ration of tiny egg/bacon is way off compared to the huge croissant. Stick to what you do best, Bosa!! Donut heaven!!"}
{"text":"I love their good old fashioned glazed doughnuts!! Very good price and great taste (much better than Dunkin). The drive-thru guy threw in 2 free doughnuts for me when I only ordered 4! Very nice people and excellent quality."}
{"text":"Dear Bosa, 

I *heart* you. I really do. Just thinking about your delicious ham & cheese stuffed croissant makes the butterflies in my tummy all sorts of flippy-floppy. I didn't really care for the jalapeno-added variety, but it's not your fault. I guess I'm just not as much of a jalapeno lover as I thought I was. But the item on your menu that brings me nothing but unadulterated bliss is your lemon filled donut. So soft and yielding, I just can't help myself when I'm around them. Powdered sugar on my face, in my hair, all over my hands and clothes...it feels just as obscene as it sounds, and I want to continue this dirty romance for many, many years to come. I'm sure I will try your other options, the tryst I had with your sinful apple fritter was a one (maybe two-four) time thing. But I'll always come back for a sweet surrender to your doughy lemon lumps. *blush*"}
{"text":"Best donuts in town! Bosa is consistent in their quality of donuts no matter which location you go to. They are the softest and freshest tasting donuts. They remind me of the really good donut shops I would go to in California with my family. Whether you get donut holes, other donuts, breakfast sandwiches, smoothies or Thai tea with boba, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of donuts, I like them, I'm just no donut officianado, which is why I'm writing this review - because this place is good.  Donuts are basically fried sugar, flour and fat, and are subsequently delicious - so I won't praddle on for a paragraph about the merits of donuts, or try to make donut eating sound more sophisticated than waking up with a huge sugar craving and deciding to throw your healthy eating out the window for the day.  We all have those days, and I support them.  I will, however, say that this place is pretty legit, and is definitely worth a visit to check out.  I'm a fan of more 'plain' donuts (I don't enjoy anything that squirts out of my donut when I bite it, read: surprises) - and they were really great.  So, check BoSa out!"}
{"text":"Ordered a mix variety box to go and didn't seem any different than most other donuts, then again I don't eat them very often. I can say I tried it, but not sure I'd go all the way out there to get it again. Meh."}
{"text":"Best donuts in town hands down. Service is pleasant so far but they've only been open at this location a few days. The breakfast sandwiches are delicious and so is the thai tea. Prices here are pretty good and the inside is nice and clean but again its only been a few days...update to come"}
{"text":"Amazing donuts! Especially when they're warm, fresh from the back. So much better than any national chains."}
{"text":"The drive thru is a 90 degree angle and ruined my brand new rims. The other bosa locations are great but this one needs to change the drive thru."}
{"text":"the doughnuts were okay. the employees, however, were absolutely terrible. I had to repeat my order 3-4 times because the two girls working were talking to each other and ignoring us. my boyfriend also had to repeat himself several times. then as we were paying the cashier (same girl that got the doughnuts) literally threw the bag onto the counter at us. wtf??"}
{"text":"My friend and I arrived at Bosa tonight a little after it closed. The lights were shut off and it didn't look like we were getting any donuts. That was until an employee (or the owner) noticed us and opened up the store for a moment to make sure we didn't go home empty handed.

Also, I only had one donut so I don't for sure, but it tasted like the donuts are actually made fresh and not simply reheated like the larger chains do."}
{"text":"Great donuts, open 24 hours. Idk why yelp Has different hours. The owner knows and she doesnt know how to update it. Fresh donuts at 9pm!  Plus she thru in some free ones as well."}
{"text":"Heavenly! I swear the best freaking donuts ! You can order at anytime of day and they are still fresh and yummy... The buttermilk and apple fritter and just plain glazed are my fav."}
{"text":"BEST and CHEAPEST donuts in the Valley. $6.99 for a dozen.   I love the glazed.  I love supporting this locally owned, family owned place."}
{"text":"Bosa has been around as long as I remember and i just now started going there a lot. I love the Thai Ice Tea, turkey croissant sandwich, the donuts are amazing and the people working are always happy and are so nice to my 4 year old daughter. Thanks Bosa for being great!"}
{"text":"I am a fairly simple man.  . . I want a donut. My preference is a good cream filled long john (i'm talking vanilla cream, not custard)

Here at Bosa, well they started out by noting that when they fill long johns they only fill them with custard (yech) - I had asked for a vanilla filled.  

After more looking I noticed some standard rounds that were filled with cream (WTF lady, I said I would like cream filled and you didn't think to mention you had one?)

So I got the cream filled and I must say it was the oddest vanilla cream filled doughnut i've ever tasted. I do not know what was in that donut but I can tell you it wasn't vanilla cream.  Just some weird sugary sweet white substance.

The glazed donuts were awesome, and the apple fritter thing was REALLY good as well.

Yet this place is definitely solidly meh-ok and no where near awesome."}
{"text":"I love this place, when I need my midnight fix for something sweet I know I can run to Bosa for some doughnuts. Open 24 hours, you can eat inside and they have milk in a carton! That takes me back to my cafeteria days in school. They also offer tea, chocolate milk in a carton, soda, coffee ect. All kinds of doughnuts are offered but their smoothies are something to be desired. It was more like a milkshake in consistency and taste. Everything is made fresh at all hours of the day and they have a drive-thru in case you wanted to add insult to injury by not even getting out of your car to get your fat laden doughnuts."}
{"text":"Came in stood at counter for about 5 minutes while employees told me \"hang on\" and stood by drive thru window.  Not worth the time."}
{"text":"I'm a donut fanatic so wherever I go, I need to make a donut pit stop. After reading some reviews online, Bosa donuts was my destination of choice. The selection is amazing and you can't beat the price either. I'm from NYC and some places charge $3-$4 a donut. I got half a dozen here for under $5. If I had space in my luggage, I would have ordered a dozen b/c I think that was under $9. 

As for the donut itself, it was so soft and chewy. I ate one immediately and they survived my flight the next day back to NY. That is real quality. Would definitely visit again if i'm back in AZ."}
{"text":"A donut shop that opens at 5 am and closes at 10 pm daily when most donut shops in my old area stayed open until 2 pm at the latest. Nice staff, good blended coffees and glorious donuts that taste fresh. Definitely will be coming back here!"}
{"text":"These donuts are amazing, nice & warm! Glaze and pink sprinkles also I decided to get the breakfast sandwich with sausage cheese and egg on a English muffin and OMG it was amazing!! I was so surprise.. Cause usually it all tastes the same but nope. Definitely recommend you should try this place out & get the breakfast sandwich! !!"}
{"text":"I give Bosa Doughnuts 2 stars only because it's important to make sure the doughnuts are not dry. I ordered a dozen doughnuts and they were dry. The icing was only on the very top and it was like they took it out of the refrigerator or something. Doughnuts should be soft and edible vs dry and hard. Me and my family didn't get through all the doughnuts because day after day they just get harder when they are setting in the box. I had to throw out the other half that we couldn't eat because it was to dry. Not sure if I will go back or give it another go one day. Maybe I came at the time right before they changed the doughnuts that were sitting All morning or something."}
{"text":"Best donuts in the valley.  Homer Simpson would feel right at home.  They have several varieties, flexible store hours and also a good assortment of drinks to wash down the donuts .  I opted today for the apple filled and triple chocolate cake with milk.  Both were yummy, the apple filling reminded me of apple pie.  I don't eat donuts often, but when I do I choose BOSA."}
{"text":"I'm so confused by all the rave reviews. I was craving a donut and I'd kept hearing about Bosa, so I made a run. Tried the chocolate raised donut and a glazed donut hole. I'm beyond disappointed...I've had better donuts at the gas station! Besides being mediocre at best, they left an awful aftertaste that wont go away! Bummer."}
{"text":"Their donut holes used to be a dozen for $1. Now they're almost $3/dozen and don't even taste great. Mine were cold! 
Bosa Donuts has definitely lost their quality over the years. 



Update: the business owner thinks my review is a joke. How professional. All these other reviews are fake because tell me why they're posted a day after my review. I have proof of the amount charged to me just for those donut holes. Their receipt doesn't include the item description."}
{"text":"Delicious donuts but apathetic service. 

Parking: This location has OK parking. It is within a strip center. But everything in Phoenix seems to be in a strip mall type of area. 

Service:  Depends... Maybe I just have gone at bad times. I have been here three times, and the individuals working seem annoyed that I am purchasing products from their store. 

Food:  Tasty donuts, muffins, etc.   I have tried the glazed, chocolate, and others.   One time I mentioned it was someone's birthday, and the woman did give me an extra muffin.  

Price: The prices are about right for a small donut shop."}
{"text":"Hands down, best donuts in AZ! Their donuts are always fresh.  The donut holes are a steal and they are amazing! You will want more than a dozen of those. They also have sandwiches which are pretty good for the price."}
{"text":"The doughnuts here are phenomenal! Definitely one of the best bakeries in the valley. Everything is always super fresh. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is that on the two occasions I ordered coffee it was horrible. I got some sort of flavored iced coffee once and a frozen blended coffee drink the next time and both times they were sickly sweet - the iced coffee I could only handle half and the blended beverage I took one sip and had to get rid of it. I had my boyfriend try it - he hates bold coffees and will only drink super sweet flavored stuff - and he couldn't even drink it. I feel like a place specializing in breakfast stuff should at least offer mediocre coffee."}
{"text":"I love me some bosa!  ESPECIALLY when they accept credit cards/debit without charging you extra for using it!! I never minded the cash thing but the only con to this particular bosa in my opinion was the lack of variety. No French cruellers no maple old fashioned no blueberry cake donuts or cherry fritters. So far my top two is the one in Tempe and the one in Chandler because Tempe has the most variety and the Chandler is just the closest to me.  
Even though they screwed up my order slightly I love bosa anyways"}
{"text":"Disappointing... Great hole in the wall feel but the donuts were dry and tasted like old oil. The fritter was too dry and really missed the mark."}
{"text":"went for the fist time
awesome donut balls 
have only had them and a shake 
will be back"}
{"text":"We've tried them all. This is the best. Try the buttermilk. Never had one like it anywhere. Totally addicting. And the raspberry filled jelly donut to die for. Great, now I want donuts!!"}
{"text":"They charged me wrong and forgot my order. Very unprofessional staff."}
{"text":"Seriously one of my fav. Donut spots. Always fresh and yummy donuts. Awesome that they have a drive thru."}
{"text":"Bosa is just a one stop shop for most delicious snack items. Whether it's a freshly prepared delicious donut, a super tasty lunch time sandwich (they have ham and tuna- and you can get it on croissant, bagel, or English muffin), or a breakfast sandwich (which by the way are BOMB!), Bosa delivers. They have the richest and creamiest smoothies, they even have Taro and Boba which is awesome too! I'm an overall fan and can come any time of day too, which is cool because they're open 24hours."}
{"text":"In was searching for a nearby boba tea place and I was surprise to learn Bosa made them. I ordered 3 different once for my two children and myself. My son's watermelon flavored one was just undrinkable by how sweet it was and he flavor was gross. My daughter's taro was not too bad but the bobas themselves were a little undercooked and hard in the middle. I got the blended Thai tea and this one was very sweet but the flavor was good. We asked for no whip cream but all 3 still came out with the topping, which in my opinion does not belong on a boba tea. Very disappointing. Looks like I will keep searching..."}
{"text":"Bosa Donuts are the best donuts I've ever had they're so fresh made on premise unlike the national chains that have them delivered from a warehouse not like the old days this is old school donut shop. We always had to travel but now there's a brand new one right down the street on Central just south of Indianola open 24 hours I love getting the donut holes always fresh and they're only a dollar 19 a dozen you can't get that deal anywhere and a top it off they're giving a free donut or a small cup of coffee for the entire month of May which is very nice so go check them out support local business support mom and pop shops"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful- not only was the young lady up front very dismissive but when I mentioned there was fly's inside of the glass where the donuts are she gave me the most annoyed look and responded with \"Okay what else do you want.\" Didn't bother to check as if she already knew there was flys in there. To top it off the fly's are ALSO stuck on the donuts."}
{"text":"Great donuts, and fresh. The people are great also. Not like the \"I dont care kids\" behind the register. These have been hearty people, franchises are goibg down the drain. And customer service is also, maybe lack of training"}
{"text":"Best donuts in the world.  I have not traveled the world but I'm pretty sure I'm right.  Plus they DO have free wifi so why go to another place for mediocre donuts.  If I'm gonna eat those kinds of calories I want each one to be delicious."}
{"text":"The speaker system is terrible. My order is always wrong because of the speaker and or miscommunication 

Today I asked for 3 donuts and left with 6.  ???

Otherwise the food and coffee is excellent"}
{"text":"Bosa is a must! 

Positives:
These donuts are soooo gooood. The perfect amount of light and fluffy mixed with a slight soft and chewy.  It's like they take these things out right before they are done to ensure they are soft and not overdone.  These things are delightful and addicting. 

Negatives:
Not location in Goodyear"}
{"text":"I can't. My family. Our lives. Meaningless without bosa. We would starve on weekends. My baby only likes me because I get him donut holes. 

I can't review this. It has become part of our lives."}
{"text":"Here's another 5 star company. I started by trying out their best donuts in town. I ended up being a super fan of their breakfast croissants and now I'm addicted to their #8 tuna on croissant. They have the best Thai tea around. I finally had a business meeting with an advertiser and was able to finally take a vantage of their free Wi-Fi so I know that works. Great place!! Btw, they decided to jump on the bandwagon and put a little bacon on their maple donuts. HEAVEN"}
{"text":"Best doughnuts around. Where else can u get a ham, cheese & jalepeno croissant, apple fritter & a Thai tea. Just this place!"}
{"text":"Had their donut holes and buttermilk donut. Both tasted just as good as the first Bosa I went to years ago. This new facility is larger and more spacious than the original so it doesn't look as \"hole in the wall,\" but it still retains the same great taste. Truly the only downside is that with this new location being so close to home I'm going to need to dig deeper for the willpower to resist going here often lol."}
{"text":"The donuts are great! Also, the Thai tea is delicious! They are open 24 hours as well! My only complaint is that they don't have milk alternatives for their drinks but everything is delicious."}
{"text":"I'm from California where every donut shop you go in is good. When I moved to Arizona I couldn't find a good donut shop until I tried this place.  Their donuts taste like old school. They are also open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Pretty damn good donuts.  Unlike many donut shops, they had buttermilk donuts - my personal fav.

Good stuff, and, open 24/7.  Who could ask for anything more than 24/7 buttermilk donuts??

Ya feel me?"}
{"text":"Mmm... BO - SA goood!  I normally eat bosa donuts when someone from the office decides to pick some up on a weekday.  They are by far, my favorite donuts.  I normally do not eat donuts, but recently, I just had this craving.

This past weekend, my first time ever, I visited Bosa to pick up a dozen for a group event.  The shop is small and not luxorious, but who cares?  I wasn't planning on sitting down, reading a book, and people watch.  Ugh - have you ever really watched people eat donuts?  It's not a pretty sight.  It's like a challenge - to get that \"almost the size of your face\" donut in your mouth.  You stop for one moment to get your mouth ready and you open up.  Lips start to hurt and chap up and once you get it in there, you have this face like you accomplished something \"bigger than life\"  and after, you have frosting all over your lips and upper lip!  

Well, at least that's what I think people are thinking when they eat their donut because quite honestly, they look like their thinking that.  

I think that when I'm eating my donut!  Don't judge. Just don't watch me."}
{"text":"Been there twice.  The first time the bathrooms (my wife told me about the Women's room) were not clean, and the men's room had no soap.  I asked as I always do- the employees use that restroom.

The place just looked not clean overall the second time.  I watched while my wife and friends ate their pastries.  They all enjoyed them.

I suggest looking at their health inspection on Maricopa County Environmental Services' website, if you're interested.  I did that after our second visit, and as you can tell from the first sentence- we never returned."}
{"text":"The perfect donut + good coffee = Bosa.  What makes a perfect donut in my mind?  Fluffy, fresh, not too doughy and not *too* sweet.  I'm not a donut expert, but those are my factors in evaluating the deliciousness of a donut.  Bosa donuts scores an A+ in my book!

And they don't just do donuts!  The breakfast sandwiches are delicious as well."}
{"text":"We are now living in upstate NY.  Husband flew to PHX and then brought home a dozen Bosa apple fritters.  Now THAT is TRUE LOVE!! Diamonds?  Nice.  Riches?  Sure.  Bosa apple fritters?  YES!!!"}
{"text":"I've been in here several times and the donuts are always tasty.  The problem they have is cleanliness.  Without sounding to much like grouch, I have to say that this place is really dirty.  It's so dirty that I have a hard time understanding how they gets so much business.  Every table was dirty the last time I went in.  The walls need some serious cleaning too.  On some of the reviews, I see that they have good customer service.  Good customer service?  Really? They are luke-warm at best, and roll their eyes too much.  It's like, \"What did I do?  I'm confused. What? Is it my race?  Are you just simply allowed to treat random customers like you really which that they'd leave?\"  I can't bring myself to give them more than 2 stars.

Although places like IN 'N OUt Burger and The Stand take longer than most of us want to wait, they set the standard in quality customer service.  Compare their customer service to what you get a Bosa.  Is Bosa even trying? 
(I know Bosa doesn't make burgers but they make food)"}
{"text":"Just had lunch there and had a delicious roast beef sandwich and very large Coke.  I've been there before and the place wasn't very busy but it should be.    The array of donuts looked great and I know the sandwiches are.   And the prices are right.   I recommend the place!"}
{"text":"Love this place! You cannot find a better donut place anywhere!!!! AND- the donut holes reign supreme!"}
{"text":"I always bring my son here he loves the donuts it's always a treat to give him after a good day at school. the donuts are always fresh tasty and unique. The variety of donuts is great love coming here no matter what area of the valley I'm in"}
{"text":"Best place to get doughnuts I would recommend coming here for anyone who not try it you will get your money's worth"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Their donuts and foods are always fresh out of the oven each time. And it's cheap!! Can't go wrong when it's only 6 dollars for a half dozen of donuts and a dozen of donut holes. Will always come again to this place and it's even more awesome that this place is close to home too."}
{"text":"Bosa Donuts are amazing. Don't waste your time with anyone else, buy a dozen and your office will love you."}
{"text":"My boss got us a box of their assorted donuts yesterday and they were SO GOOD! Light and fluffy, no soggy dough, not overly sweet, just the way I like them. I'll be telling all my friends to get a box of their own!"}
{"text":"These donuts are amazing!! They melt in your mouth! In my personal opinion these are the 2nd best donuts next to Arizona Donut Co...Also just a FYI some Bosa locations have better donuts than others. 

For example: The Bosa off of Ray rd taste better than the Bosa on Baseline & Mil Ave.

Hope this helps!!"}
{"text":"As many have said, their donuts are simply divine. I can also attest to their breakfast sandwiches. I've had the sausage, egg, and cheese on an English muffin and the bacon, egg, and cheese on a croissant. Both were delectable. They also have excellent Thai iced tea with boba--some of the best in the valley!"}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out since I had never been before, and it had just opened. It was the worst customer service I have experienced in awhile. The place was a mess, and my food order was wrong. By the time I got home my breakfast sandwhich was just cheese and bacon, nothing else. I could have made food at home.  I was not greeted and when I asked for the breakfast sandwhich and coffee combo the girl at the front handed me a piece of paper to write my name on and gave no direction. She forgot my coffee, and just seemed sad to be working.  If you go for food you have to be specific, because they will take your food order literal. I will never be going back. I understand they opened a week ago so perhaps I got the back end of everything. I did try to call to re-order and the number was wrong...it was the Arizona Ave location and the woman did not understand what I was saying on the phone. Regardless, people make excuses as to why service isn't what it is, everyone has their days, but it's still work."}
{"text":"Bosa is a nice little place. Its not extravagant, but it has good drinks and great donuts.

The drive-through intercom is the worst. As if I didn't already dislike hearing my own voice, it comes right back to you in duplicate with feedback. The staff is friendly and service consistent. The speed at the drive thru is moderate, depending on how busy they are.

The fact that I can get a Thai tea boba at a drive-through is fantastic. Not the best one I've had, but it does the job. The donuts are always fresh. My personal favorite is the Boston Cream. I have also gotten a few sandwiches at this location. The turkey is just cheapie lunch meat, so I want impressed.  The bacon, egg & cheese is great on either a bagel or croissant. Neither are anything to write home about, but makes for a quick and sturdy breakfast."}
{"text":"I stopped by here for a quick Saturday morning order and the donuts very fresh and tasty! Great little donut shop located in a convenient location. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Ummm... heaven in my mouth!! The best donuts ever!! The coffee is amazing. Great customer service. Too bad they didn't have fat free/zero calorie donuts!!"}
{"text":"i both hate and love that bosa is only about five blocks from my house. their donuts really are that good. 

the cream of the crop is the buttermilk donut-it's moist, fresh, and delicious. i usually don't like super sweet donuts with tons of frosting/filling, so this is the perfect little glazed piece of heaven. i make everyone who goes here try one if they haven't already-they're really that good. 

i LOVE that they have thai tea here as well. i often swing by the drive through and just get that-although it is hard to resist getting a donut too. you even have the option of boba, and they have some other rad smoothie/drink choices as well (taro, etc.). 

i've also noticed they have sandwiches that look pretty good but i've never tried one.  hard to think about sandwiches when you have donuts on the mind!"}
{"text":"The donuts are good, but management is horrible..If you pay by credit card, and plan on tipping , DON'T BECAUSE THE WORKERS DON'T GET ANY OF THE TIPS OFF THE CARD. THAT'S ILLEGAL TOO. 
   They tell the girls to say they get it but I know for a fact they don't.  Then they switched it up and they pull all the cash tips together and split it once a month. 
   PRETTY SURE THE MANAGEMENT IS SKIMMING OFF THE TOP OF THAT TOO.. 

Might want to check for citizenship  or food handlers documentation on some of the employees. too
 
I won't be a returning customer..."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service! Delicious donuts and coffee. I love the drive thru for convenience and they are always so fast at serving me! Perfect for before work!"}
{"text":"Good people working here, their donuts are incredible, their coffee too, but the smoothies are powdered unfortunately. They have apple juice so it's cool."}
{"text":"The best, fresh donuts ever.  Heaven in your mouth.  Soft, delicate, sugary sweet glaze. Never shall u eat Dunkin donuts again."}
{"text":"that buttermilk donut
i don't even like buttermilk
so bomb

(be nice and ask them to swipe some chocolate on it. so good!)"}
{"text":"These are by far the best donuts in Arizona. They are always open, it's super convenient that they have a drive thru, and the employees are friendly and helpful. I'll choose to drive out of my way to get donuts from here before I go to any other donut store."}
{"text":"Great donut shop. The food was great and the staff was amazing. Stopped in on a business trip and they made me feel at home which was great for a business traveler."}
{"text":"hands down, the best donuts ever. plus they're open 24h. great prices, (and remember to tip)! bosa gives me life."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Bosa Donuts. The location is close to me. They make the best Boba Drinks. The donuts are always delicious, and the staff knows how to make some good coffee as well."}
{"text":"Delicious donuts! They are friendly and quite quick. This is important bc I'm always rushing to work. I live the Thai Iced Tea. It's a great slightly sweet milky iced tea with a hint of spice. You must try it."}
{"text":"just like every other positive review - yummy, fresh, great flavor and textures.
I got a dozen for the office, and everyone came in to thank me - I picked up random choices that looked good, and everyone was happy.
I just moved into the neighborhood and saw the BOSA  store over the weekend, and it is so easy to stop in there on my way to work; my work buddies encouraged me to stop there as often as possible.
I WILL."}
{"text":"BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!

I am a very big fan of Bosa and their menu items. Delicious coffee, delicious doughnuts, delicious breakfast sandwiches and delicious boba tea. HOWEVER, someone there is engaged in credit card fraud and identity theft. My information was ripped off and sold to a third party harvester that tried to drain all the funds in my account all within the time it took to drive thru and order breakfast. But, fortunately for me I check my activity daily. 

I can't say I won't ever go back again, because these are the acts of an individual one would assume. But I would highly advise anyone who goes there to be a cash paying customer from now on. I know I will be."}
{"text":"Dunkin Donuts is going to have quite the competitor with Bosa now open across the street. Love their donuts here!  Everything is hot and fresh and it's no wonder that this place is always insanely busy--their donuts are that good. 

I was stoked to have Bosa move to my neighborhood. Now I'll be here every day."}
{"text":"Love the donuts, Thai iced tea, and iced coffee here! I can always count on their freshness! I recently tried out their lunch sandwiches  (tuna sandwich and turkey sandwich). Both were delicious."}
{"text":"Bosa is easily the best donut shop in the valley.  Take your Krispy Kream and shove it. Anyone can heat up a donut to make it taste better, but Bosa doesn't need that. They're great even if they're a day old. Also, everybody says the apple fritter is the bomb. I don't know about that, but the bear claw is filled with baked apples and I have never had a better donut, EVER, than that! Their cinnamon swirls are also out of this world. Yum!"}
{"text":"I would have put one star. I love the donuts but taste is not consistent, today was the last straw I tasted soap in my raspberry filled donut. I tried it again because I didn't believe it and it was dish washing soap mixed with raspberry ( in the raspberry not dough) I regret trying it again because I tasted more soap, I spat it out quickly. I have washed my mouth but the taste is still there.
The first raspberry I tasted was good, the second one terrible, it had soap in it. I have not had any problems in the past 3 months until today and 2 weeks ago. Two weeks ago, we purchased 10 glazed donuts in the afternoon, 4 donuts tasted wet, like soaked in melted sugar."}
{"text":"Ordered milk, got a Coke. She fixed it. Ordered a Bostom Cream and ended up with a glazed donut. Realized it after we drove away. Super pissed."}
{"text":"My wife was patient and polite but could not understand the waitresses description of the different hot chocolate flavors. The waitress grew visibly agitated at our not understanding her English. We worked that out continuing to be kind, but when we sat at our table the  3 workers were talking or almost yelling very loudly at each other and screeching out laughter. It's a little much at 6am when your looking for a quiet cup of coffee/hot chocolate and a donut."}
{"text":"Okay, I haven't tried too many things here. Just standard donuts that's really good. I will definitely go back for a thai tea and donut. 
But, the thing that makes this place a 5 star is that it's open 24 hours?! 
I've been there with my friend at like 11 pm or midnight because we just want to talk over a donut and tea or coffee. What a nice way to spend the night. 
Plus, they have all been super friendly. 
It's a great place to catch up! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said in all the wonderful review before me.    Best donut place in town hands down.   Please try one of their wonderful creations, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good doughnuts and very nice people!  We were greeted by nice smiling faces who promptly helped us and answered all our questions."}
{"text":"We came here for donut holes and boba tea on a Monday evening, an interesting combination but both foods are equally delicious when done right. First, the boba tea was blended instead of iced, which threw us off our game a little. It made the tarot milk taste a little watered down. Additionally, they topped it with whipped cream which we had to scoop off as we were not looking for a Frappuccino con Dulce. The donut holes are pretty taste for a good price but nothing that blew me away."}
{"text":"I really need to find a different way to work! Lol! It's hard to resist stopping by for a quick breakfast! Their breakfast sandwiches are tasty! I order a bacon, egg and cheese croissant! Of course, the donuts are delicious and fresh! Will never go to a Dunkin Donuts ever again! They even have Boba Drinks and my favorite, Thai Iced Tea!!"}
{"text":"Great donuts and the ham and cheese with jalapeños croissant were great too! Highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"Excellent donuts! Nice and fluffy in the inside. Their chocolate icing was pretty crappy, but I've found American chocolate in general is like that so no high expectations. The glazed donut was my favourite and the prices are cheap, cheap, cheap!!!"}
{"text":"Take all the competition and just forget about them... this place is the real deal if you want fantastic donuts! The jalapeño/ham croissants are off the charts good!  The muffins are really good and the donuts...well... again... just forget about Dunkin...Krispy... and the others... this place is where you want to go.  My love handles thank you Bosa!"}
{"text":"I have to issue this disclaimer: I've been following a strict low-sugar, low carb eating plan for the last 5 years so of course when I fall off the wagon, everything with even a HINT of sweetness tastes like gold to me. 

When I was visiting Phoenix and passed by Bosa Donuts and saw a line OUT THE DOOR, I immediately made a U-turn. My road trip foodie philosophy has always been \"if you see a line, get in it.\" 

As a long time donut fan (I wasn't fat for the majority of my life for no reason), I was psyched to try these donuts. When it was finally my turn, the scowling hipster behind the counter helped me select 3: an original glazed, a Boston cream and an apple fritter. She was not too pleased that I declined her upsell to half a dozen so she scowled even more.

The standout in the bunch was the original glazed. It was soft and not too sweet. The Boston cream was fine (not worth eating) and the apple fritter was not my cup of tea. It was way too dense and way too sweet. The only thing that was completely devoured was the original glazed. I've had some fantastic donuts in the world (Lee's Donuts in Vancouver and Randy's Donuts in Los Angeles being my two favorites) and while Bosa's are pretty good, they wouldn't make my top 10 greatest donuts list. Worth a stop if you're in Phoenix but I don't see what the crazy fuss is about. Sorry."}
{"text":"If you're reading this, chances are that you're not karmically righteous enough to ever hope to achieve nirvana.   However, be glad that you found this review, because I'm about to tell you that a road to religious enlightenment *does* still exist for you -and it's much simpler than the Noble Eightfold Path.

If it wasn't already obvious, your quest will both start and end quite conveniently at the Bosa Donuts on McDowell Rd.  And you'll be pleased to learn that no matter what you order, this shortcut to a life of fulfillment won't cost you any more than a few dollars and cents.

There are a near-infinite number of conceivable menu combinations that can help you quickly unlock your spiritual rebirth, however I'm going to recommend two particular ingredients as the fastest and surest way to eternal bliss:

1) Buttermilk Donuts
2) Taro smoothies with boba

At this point, you should already have stopped reading this review and made haste to the closest form of transportation at hand.  Once you've arrived, you'll be too far too preoccupied with all the revelation happening in your mouth to remember to thank me - or anyone else -for leading you to Bosa.  And I won't blame you.  On the path to salvation, selfishly and voraciously indulging in buttermilk donuts and boba smoothies is sooooo much better than just being nice to people."}
{"text":"Best donuts in Arizona, for sure! Love the new location. Right down street from my house. Open 24 hours. Buttermilk and glazed chocolate cake are amazing! Also like the plain glazed. These things are addicting."}
{"text":"Great donuts even from a late night drive-thru doughnut run. I love that they're open so late (take note, Dunkin). The only problem with coming so late is that they're usually out of the top choices. Definitely go for a crumble or sourdough."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about Phoenix, but you can't seem to find a decent donut shop here.  Bosa seems to be about the best option we have, and while it's not bad, it's far from anything special.  This Scottsdale location is much better managed than the Chandler store, so I give them credit for that--it's cleaner and the donuts are much fresher.  I only wish Phoenicians could experience a great donut, which will never come from places like Bosa, Krispy Kreme, or Dunkin Donuts."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for the last four years. It's pretty much the only donut place I go to, but I don't go often. I usually get their glazed donut, donut holes, or their beagle ham & cheese sandwich. I have never been disappointed with the food I have received. 

The only thing I do have a problem with is their customer service. I can only recall one time that I have gone and the employee was nice. She was smiling and making jokes as she rung me up. Unfortunately that was the only time I ever saw her.  Every other time I've been here, the staff is unnecessarily rude.If they were super busy and understaffed then I could understand why they might be a little grouchy, but that has never been the case. 

The donuts are not what has me coming back and the HORRIBLE customer service hasn't pushed me away only because Bosa is really close to where I live, they're open 24/7, and they're cheap. The convince of this location outweighs everything I don't like about them."}
{"text":"Good donuts here.  They have breakfast and lunch sandwiches too.  Service is good.  Nice variety of donuts to choose from.  Big beverage selection as well, including coffee drinks, teas, juices, sodas and more."}
{"text":"They've been open a few days and it's already FILTHY inside. Just like all their other stores. Trash all over the floors, spilled things, overflowing garbage and crap stuck all over the trashcan flap thing. 

Their new sign says COFFEE SMOOTHIES AND DONUTS. I live like 1 minute away so I was excited for a place I could walk to and grab a quick iced coffee. It sucked. It was bitter and burnt tasting. And if they're going to advertise as a coffee place, maybe some actual cold creamers? And not fucking Mini Moos. The coffee mixing self service station was very dirty already and did I mention Mini Moos and not actual half and half or milk? At a place with the word COFFEE in the sign outside. 

Can't comment on the donuts at this location. I have had them from other locations and they were just fine. Nothing spectacular but I would rather support a local business instead of a chain. 

To the owners: PLEASE keep this location clean. It's so new! It would be so easy to maintain it! Please don't let it fall into filth like the other stores. Clean the floors. Sweep up all the trash everywhere... Wipe things off. It's pretty simple. Seeing a filthy store that sells food makes me wonder how clean the food prep area is kept."}
{"text":"I like it. There is not much for me to say this time because they are just donuts. Come here for a fresh selection. The only thing I didn't like was that the prices were a little steep. About 9 bucks for a dozen."}
{"text":"Their donuts are so juicy and fresh, melt in your mouth. They are known best (at least at my job) for their donut holes; they have regular frosted and chocolate. My favorite are the chocolate. **beware, you may go into a donut hole frenzy after the first bite!! They are so so good! 

They also have a lot of other options including assorted donuts, other pastries, coffee drinks, smoothies, etc. The establishment is very clean and neat, and a plus us they open super early. I also discovered they have other locations, but I think this one is the best."}
{"text":"Best Donuts in Phx!
I am sucker for a buttermilk bar and theirs are amazing!  They are heavy and filling not like Krispy Kreme light and airy.
They also have a drive thru - making them awesome!"}
{"text":"I just had a happy breakfast and I don't feel guilty!! Even the regular costumers are soo happy and friendly, there is no way to start a happy day than this ha!"}
{"text":"If there is one thing lacking in the Valley it's good independent donut shops. Luckily I don't live too far from Bosa Donuts in Chandler. But these donuts are worth the drive, wherever you might be coming from.

Bosa is open 24-7 which makes it perfect for late night donut cravings or lazy Sunday mornings. They have a decent variety. A mix of raised, cake, and filled. My favorites are the glazed twist (so good!) and their old fashioned donuts. The cream filled are also tasty and the boyfriend loves the jelly filled. 

This place is cheap too. Got 6 donuts the other day for $4. Can't beat it. The atmosphere is nothing to write home about and at times can feel a little creepy so we always just get our donuts to go.

In my opinion this isn't just the best donut shop in Chandler, it's the best in the Valley."}
{"text":"Love that they are open 24hrs and have great Thai tea. Very friendly staff. 
The donuts are always fresh."}
{"text":"The donuts here are good however it's the service I am rating. The server was impolite."}
{"text":"I love their donuts, this specific location is always so clean and they're always so cheerful and nice!"}
{"text":"There donut were so good, I didn't want to share with my kids.I did share after awhile.There better than dunkin  donuts and frys and crispy Kreme ."}
{"text":"Doughnuts are beautiful ! Good selection and Same price range as Dunkin or Krispy . Coffee was ok. The kids loved their smoothies! they had Apx 9 flavors to chose from , & with my bogo coupon they were dirt cheap . 
Good"}
{"text":"I literally hate this place because their donut holes are so delicious and addicting! I moved into an apartment down the street and now I have to drive by it everyday... Haunting my dreams with delicious donuts"}
{"text":"Best donuts anywhere!! Boston Creme and Vanilla Creme are my favorites. Only one person working the line for inside and drive thru can slow things down. Worth any wait you have to go through!!! I happened to be up early enough one morning to come in when the donuts were still fresh... HOLY @#$% they are good!!!  Krispe Kreme and whatever else you may be thinking is not on the same level!!"}
{"text":"I went there yesterday for the first time with my husband and we had bagel sandwiches(ham&cheese, tuna) and donuts(chocolate covered, toasted coconut) which we enjoyed them a lot. 

The donuts are very soft and fresh. I found them a bit too sweet but my husband seemed to enjoy the sweetness. I still think this place is one of the best donuts places in Phoenix. 

Good variety of donuts and they also have croissant and bagel sandwiches and boba drinks, which is very similar to Rainbow Donuts on McDowell. This place is bigger with more variety. 

Customers kept coming while we were there and a few customers were waiting all the time as only one lady was handling all the customers. Not that I complain about that but I felt sorry for her. She was handling all the customers inside and at the drive thru. But she was handling them very well and with a very polite manner saying \"thank you for waiting\" to every customer. She was pretty quick to prepare our order too. 

The price is also quite reasonable. I forgot the exact prices but a donut was around $.75 and  sandwich was $3.49 each if I remember correctly."}
{"text":"I walked to this location today around 5pm and the service was very quick and friendly, this was my first time here. I ordered a mango and honeydew smoothie which was off the chain yo!"}
{"text":"I have an unhealthy addiction to the glazed and crumb donuts here.  I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Got a coupon in the mail for donut holes and thought I'd get some for my office. The counter clerk took the coupon, said they won't honor it at their location and to try the one that issued the coupon, and then threw the coupon away. What a bitch. Donut holes and the coffee were average. Paid full price to never go here again."}
{"text":"Bosa Donuts is a delightful local fast-casual chain that specializes in donuts, drinks, and sandwiches. This is typically a drive-through or carry-out place for me, but I have sat inside on occasion in different valley locations.

Service: Pretty consistent between stores, staff is friendly and helpful. Nothing stands out here, but it's a pleasant experience every time. 4/5.

Food: I love the #6 turkey on croissant sandwich. Thai Tea with or without boba is excellent. But honestly, it's all about the donuts. They are all good, but the buttermilk is to die for. 5/5.

Ambiance: Fast casual environment, nothing stellar here, but they aren't trying to be fancy. 3/5.

Parking: Typically plenty of uncovered parking around the 12+ valley Boba locations."}
{"text":"Stopped by because of the rating, but was totally let down.  Got some donuts and smoothie.  Originally ordered it with boba, but changed my mind.... The young man who took our order took the bowl with boba and poured water into it.  Then he stuck his finger into the bowl to give it a swirl before placing the bowl into the microwave.  And nope, he wasn't wearing any gloves... I promptly canceled the boba . I admit the taro smoothie was decent, but couldn't help wonder how sanitary this place was.... The donuts were stale and forgettable.  Took a few bites and tossed the rest."}
{"text":"Great flavor without that oily aftertaste you sometimes get with donuts. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and these were so good I had to take a dozen on the plane home! 
They're a must every time in PHX"}
{"text":"Awesome!  Simply the best Apple Fritter I've ever had in my life.  And cheap!

STRONG coffee.  You've been warned! :)"}
{"text":"Nice staff. Fast Service. Delicious BOBA and donuts!"}
{"text":"I love donuts. The buttermilk donuts are the best. The new store on Southern opens on Monday. I'm going to have to start jogging again. (like I ever did in the 1st place anyway). I have to think. Is there any other donut shop better..... NO. Although putting sugar in your mouth is good by itself, Bosa has some real special way of making their donuts crispy on the outside and real soft and fluffy or dense on the inside. Dunkin is great and will always be getting bigger and bigger like some other donut shop we all use to know. But Bosa is just down right yummy."}
{"text":"Best donuts in Peoria !! They don't just serve donuts they also have breakfast sandwiches , lunch sandwiches , smoothies, coffee , and even a drive thru ! I haven't tried a lot on their menu but so far the bagel sandwich is delicious , the ham and cheese croissant  is really good! It's a closed croissant with ham and melted cheese inside yum!! 
I've tried the strawberry banana smoothie .. it was ok kinda tasted like medicine . 
Overall a good place to stop by and try !"}
{"text":"Delicious donuts with friendly staff. This Bosa Donuts is different from other Bosa Donuts. The quality of the donuts also different. This Bosa Donuts location seems to have higher quality donuts than some other Bosa donuts. Keep in mind that some Bosa coupon wouldn't be accepted at this location because seem like they have a different owner and not franchise. I think the only coupon that has the 37 W. Baseline would be accepted at this location. 

But it's a good place for quick stop grab something donuts or getting coffee sitting down with the friends. They also have an indoor and outdoor sitting."}
{"text":"Good donuts. HORRIBLE customer service! I usually go here for some late night donuts or a smoothie but the young lady there with braids can really ruin the experience. Never smiles and she seems like she hates being there, which to me, is not good for the business. Don't work at a place where you're miserable!! It hurts the business and you're only hurting yourself!! Extremely rude. I hope this changes SOON, I would hate to just stop coming here all because of one person's negativity. I've been patient and tolerant enough...........donuts are good tho!"}
{"text":"I had been wanting a Bosa Donuts near me for years and one finally opens in my neighborhood... after I move! Luckily, I was in the area running some errands and it was still technically breakfast time, so I stopped in. (FYI: They even have a drive thru, so I don't have to get out of the car! I'm all in favor of that when I need a quick bite.) The place wasn't terribly busy and I was able to get in and out quickly. The inside is rather spacious with plenty of seating. There is a large counter upfront displaying all the donuts and the cash register is to the left. I ordered an apple fritter for me and a cruller for my husband. My fritter was delicious. Super soft and crunchy at the same time with the delicate flavor of apple cinnamon... yum! If I'm in the area, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love Bosa, great donuts and coffee. There are always a lot of choices no matter what time of day I go"}
{"text":"Bosa always delivers on freshness. Love this place.

Breakfast and lunch bagels are also convenient when you are in a rush."}
{"text":"By far the best donuts I've ever had! This place is just around the corner. The customer service is okay. It's kind of hard to understand most of the worker at times that's why I'd rather go inside he store. The drive thru is perfect for morning runs."}
{"text":"Good location.
Inconsistent product.
One more than one occasion I have driven away taking a bite out of a doughnut that was still dough.  
When opting to stop at a Bosa, I typically avoid this location if I'm going to pick up donuts.
I don't like paying for gas to drive back to a business to fix my order.  IMO, they should be refunding my money AND replacing my order when it gets to that point."}
{"text":"This place is alright.  An old Taco Bell converted into a donut shop that's put the drive through to use, that means your weekday donuts get there not long after you've arrived.  Hehe!  
Seriously though, the drive through seems like a good option but I haven't tried it because I fear the decision making process will then come to a screeching halt because I would be lacking the ability to actually SEE what they have.
FTMP, all of the donuts they sell here are a glazed donut, some with a different twist (literally) and some with the addition of spice, fruit, or flavored gel.  They are good, but I gotta tell ya, my first job was in a bakery so I have a liking for more than a simple glazed donut.  Oh alright, I'm picky.  Listen, if I'm paying I can be picky.  
I'll give this the thumbs up for location and the drive through has to be a bonus for some.  For me, I'll stay with my personal fave and go to Bashas.  Still baked in the store, good and fresh, and quite possibly cheaper than what they sell here too."}
{"text":"Bosa donuts is the quiet simply the best in the valley. 24 hours, and always amazing. I take the nuggets nearly every Saturday putting me in the running of worlds greatest dad!"}
{"text":"Great staff, great donuts and reasonable prices.  They always have ample supplies and never run out of the best stuff!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! I am fairly picky when it comes to donuts and the fried dough these folks produce is among the best I have tried.

I'm an apple fritter person through and through but find myself trying all their varieties because everything is so well done. The simple glazed donuts are to die for in their gooey goodness. The fritters are crispy and very flavorful, cannot get much better than this.

I think about these donuts when I am working out at the gym and work harder to make room for them a few times a month. Sometimes I go a little more than I should since they are right down the road from me but it is worth it!"}
{"text":"I decided to go get some donuts at midnight. While ordering donuts I asked for some glazed donuts and the lady informed me they were out of glazed donuts. What kind of donut shop that is open 24 hours does not have the standard donut. This isn't the first time I have been informed they were out of donuts. Bosa may need to rethink the 24 hour operation or get better employees. I will never give bosa my money again."}
{"text":"This place is like donut crack.

Buying donuts for 8 coworkers = a million donuts??

Only at Bosa!

They have so many donuts...so many that it's impossible to choose only a few for your small group of coworkers. So many that we eat until we hit a breakfast sugar coma that can only be topped by Thanksgiving and still have some to give away to coworkers to bring home to their families. 

The staff is so super nice and help guide your overwhelming mind in as little time as possible to speed up aforementioned coma. 

For serious. You can't go wrong here people. Donut crack."}
{"text":"So many options it was hard to limit myself to only two! I think it is family owned, which is all the more reason to give it a try! Always fresh and never stale. Never eating dunkin donuts again."}
{"text":"I love BoSa Donuts! The location on 32nd and Shea is quick to get in and out of. The service is great. They are pretty fast with the orders any time of the day. I love their crumb donut.. I might be slightly addicted to it. The donuts are so fresh and delicious!! Their iced coffee is great and priced pretty low. I highly recommend you stop in!"}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy Yummy Donuts. Great friendly people and clean place to dine in. I love that they are open 24 hours."}
{"text":"First off ant Bosa open 24/7 is a gift to mankind so 5 stats for that . Same Bosa quality and they even made me fresh batch of donuts when I came in which they could of given me the old ones but quality service . Happy to have bosa on central"}
{"text":"Their Taro Boba is Addicting! The donuts are fresh and soft! I recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"If you can get a donut they are good. I've been to this location 4 times, doesn't matter what time I go they are always out of a majority of their donuts. I typically try to order 3-4 different types of donuts before giving up."}
{"text":"This Bosa location is close to my office and as such the coworkers and I like to stop by for a dozen donuts every so often. It's also my go-to breakfast spot after hiking nearby Piestewa Peak. The donuts are always fresh and deliver that Bosa quality you can expect at any of their locations across the valley. My personal favs are the buttermilk and Bavarian cream. At $0.87 per donut you seriously can't go wrong with this place!

There also seems to be a drive thru at this location as I've seen the window for it, although I'm not entirely sure it's operational as I've yet to see a car to through it. Maybe I'm just coming on off hours.

Finally, as is the case with other Bosas, they are open 24/7. Perfect for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night cravings! :P"}
{"text":"Ever since I moved to Phoenix about 4 years ago I had craved for a place with \"real\" donuts similar to the ones I'd find in the mom and pop shops in SoCal. I can gladly say I've found it! Not only are the donuts fantastic (they really do melt in your mouth) but BoSa is also open 24 HOURS 7 DAYS A WEEK! Staff was friendly and the prices are all super affordable. Needless to say I will be coming back for many future visits."}
{"text":"This place is awesome opened early and great customer service and doughnuts best in town  a must have doughnut especially it's national doughnut day"}
{"text":"Just like they say - these are the \"Best Donuts in Town\"

They always have a great selection of fresh donuts and pastries. All are perfect - never greasy or stale! 

And best of all they are cheap - great for a quick bite.

Don't expect much more - donuts, coffee, smoothies, and a refrigerator with milk and drinks to wash those heavenly donuts down!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Thai Tea in all of the donut places I have been to. I like the donuts to but I'm basic and I only eat glazed donuts so they all taste the same to me. My favorites are the donut holes because the Thai Tea goes nicely with it. Prices are reasonable and the place is pretty clean with the one of the best customer services for a late night donuts place."}
{"text":"Not sure if we just happened to get a fresh batch, but these donuts were melt in your mouth amazing!"}
{"text":"We typically pick up ham egg and cheese croissants or sausage egg and cheese croissants from this location. We also get donuts for the kids. Their iced coffee isn't too bad either. Sure beats the price of Starbucks. The only gripe I have is that this location was full of mosquitoes. My wife was bitten several times while we were just waiting in line. Bosa, please do something about your mosquito problem. Thanks."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible.. after reading a couple of reviews I waned to give this place a chance. When I got there  there was a strong smell of clorox but the smell of donut was winning. But then something happend that I don't think people will enjoy reading about . People noticed  at the donuts that there was a  red bug in top of one of them. They  told the girl behind the counter and she just moved  the rack and the bug flew to another donut. After that she just looked at the customer and said  \"so you don't want anything from this side, how about the other side?\" I mean she did not care about the situation or that her clients were concern."}
{"text":"We love Bosa Donuts! Flossy lives for the Thai ice tea boba! Staff is super friendly and they have great sandwiches too."}
{"text":"Holy smokes this is an awesome donut shop.  We made a random stop-we were literally just driving by.
You're immediately greeted by a fantastic smell like no other...a donut shop has a distinct smell and it is a good one!  We were greeted with happy, smiling faces from the employees and the selection of donuts was out of this world.  My 3 kiddos were beyond excited as they admired with eyeballs the size of saucers.
We bought an assorted dozen. So next came the hardest part...waiting til we got home to sample.  They were SO good.  Deliciously fresh and soft, the icings were all good (best maple I've ever had).  
We are a donut loving family and we were not disappointed!"}
{"text":"I came here with my sweetie who stops in every morning when he's in town to get a maple bar and a coffee. It makes him so happy. So I was looking forward to trying Bosa. It's a good, standard donut shop making classic donuts. It actually reminded me of the old Winchell's donuts in terms of offerings: cake and raised, glazed, sprinkles, chopped peanuts...you know what I mean. Cinnamon rolls were a popular choice. There were a lot of donut holes (which I love). I had the apple fritter. It was a standard apple fritter. It was not life changing as some have suggested. It was a standard, tasty apple fritter. Would I come back? Of course. Who doesn't love a tasty donut? Would I drive out of my way? Probably not."}
{"text":"I'm not really a big donut guy. But some fried breakfast sounded pretty good this morning. Plus, I work on Sunday mornings, and it always makes coworkers happy when somebody brings in junk food. So I picked up a dozen on my way to work.

Justifications aside, Bosa has great Donuts! These are way better and cheaper than Krispy Kreme or Dunkin Donuts. This is definitely the place I'll stop by when I'm in the mood for the morning sweet treats.

But don't waste your time with the coffee here. It's awful."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the stale cake doughnut I received. The other doughnuts were insanely fluffy and tasty.

When I came in, the person seemed to be more obsessed with talking on the phone than dealing with customers. However when I seemed ready, I had no problem getting her attention."}
{"text":"We were already fans of Bosa, and since this new location is closer to our house, we were happy to try it on our Donut Saturday.  Friendly service, great prices, and terrific donuts. Of course the original glazed are fantastic, but the apple fritters are the *best* I've ever had."}
{"text":"Deliciousness. Literally all i have to say. Their donuts are fluffy heaven.  Everyone at the office loves them"}
{"text":"This new location is a little less convenient than their old location, but it's a much better place.  I think they took over the KFC or Taco Bell building and it's much bigger than their old location with a drive-thru that makes sense and is easier to navigate.

The store is clean and spacious inside.  The donuts are always fresh.  I'm usually going through the drive-thru to get donuts for my husband to take to work.  Even if there is a long line in the drive-thru, the line moves very quickly.

They are always friendly at this place.  The prices are reasonable for good donuts.

Time is always important to me, so not wasting it is good.  Usually my husband will leave for work about 6 am, so I'm at this place at 5:15 am or so to get donuts for his work so they can have fresh donuts.  

Their donuts are the best, but I don't eat them too often for obvious health reasons, but periodically will have one."}
{"text":"This establishment is full of cockroaches.  After discovering this,I reported them to the health department, if they are still open today, they must of complied with roach removal, or they haven't been reinvestigated yet.  Regardless, will never ever eat there again!!"}
{"text":"I was warned not to try these donuts due to their addictive properties.  I should have heeded that warning.  Now I get wild cravings for their moist apple fritters and boston cream donuts.  And not only do they have a drive thru, but they are also open 24/7! My mouth is watering just typing this review.  So do yourself a favor, don't even get started on Bosa. You'll never be able to quit."}
{"text":"Love at first bite...creamy, dreamy, buttery, light, fluffy, crispy,delicious,amazing, perfect, lovely, beautiful, tasty and darn good!  This is the fantasy donut!  The chocolate long john and the old fashion we home runs...if you are \"jonesen\"  for a top notch donut get over to this hot spot for donuts!"}
{"text":"Sometimes, you just want a donut.

When that craving strikes, head on over to this BoSa Donuts location! 

I know you're thinking, \"Been to one BoSa, been to them all!\" but not so fast. This one is a little different in a few ways:

1) Cleaner and more modern compared to other locations 
2) No drive-thru; however, parking is plentiful 
3) This location does NOT charge .55 cents or whatever it is to use your credit card. Woohoo! Much appreciated as I rarely have cash, and I'm not about to bring home a dozen donuts. 

My favorite is definitely the Chocolate Old Fashion Donut. Melt in your mouth chocolatey goodness, especially amazing if you come in before 8AM! 

Also, if you really want to blow some calories, try the Buttermilk Donut. Don't say you weren't warned . . . so good! 

Their Thai Iced Tea here is also delicious, and the boba pieces are ginormous. 

The employees have always been cheerful and patient with customers with large orders. 

Hit up BoSa Donuts when your sweet tooth is screaming at you - Unlike the big donut chains, it's worth wasting your calories!"}
{"text":"BoSa, we've got a problem. 

Andrew C. and I discovered the news of your arrival during one of our regular walks throughout our 'hood. 

You were taking over the space once occupied by TruWest. 

Corporate Cardboard Donut Place mere steps across the street had no idea you were invading the neighborhood. 

What were they thinking? They're no match for your Buttermilk Donuts, Old Fashioneds and Apple Fritters.

I have a massive sweet tooth, that's no secret. 

Your girl also competes in weight class based sports and sometimes I look at myself in a singlet and see Old Fashioned CHOCOLATE Crullers all over it. 

Why you gotta be a scant 2 miles from us, BoSa? 

Your siren song is irresistible. It seems like every couple of months we're going on a midnight donut run - hot and fresh? You bet!

Bring a couple dozen of these donuts to your co-workers; a Vanilla Sprinkle Donut will put a smile on even the crustiest, NASTIEST person's face in an early meeting.  

Don't ever change, BoSa - You're King in the Phoenix Donut Game.

{"text":"The Bavarian cream was mind-blowing!  Sexy and silky as sin, it was the best version of this donut variety I've tried thus far.  Embrace it and you won't (literally) be able to show your face in the morning.  Approach w/ caution!"}
{"text":"Every thing was great except for the sprinkles, a few minutes in the car leaving the place I started feeling a little stomach ache, but all in all its a great place for 24 hour doughnuts."}
{"text":"I love Bosa donuts. I have not gone to a location where I have been disappointed. Open 24 hours and they always have fresh donuts.

Donuts are light and fluffy. Breakfast sandwiches and boba drinks.

A dozen donuts costs about $10."}
{"text":"Hands down, best donuts in the valley. All the locations are great. Most are open 24 - 7 and the flavor is fantastic. It's a great pickup for a morning office meeting or an even better late night snack after a night of fun. My personal fav is the pink icing with sprinkles, although the caramel long john is quickly catching up. I could go there every day."}
{"text":"These are the best donuts. We had a Birthday Party Breakfast and the were delicious. We ordered them ahead of time, they were ready, fresh and we could use our coupon. I would highly recommend this location."}
{"text":"I definitely will be returning to this place.  The doughnuts/donuts are as good, if not better, as krispy kreme or the like.  The guy working was incredibly nice and the fact there is a drive through spells trouble. I will definitely be back when I'm in the area, for sure. : )"}
{"text":"I ordered for breakfast sandwich with egg , onions, jalapeno and no cheese.
 
After i reached home to my suprise i got a breakfast sandwich with cheese, mustard sauce and no onions.

I know it is initial daya for the staff. Please slow down and check the order before you deliver to customers."}
{"text":"We have been here many times. It is a drive thru~ but  lets say before I try a new place I go inside first ALWAYS. 
 This  place was spotless, floors sparkling.They also serve Boba wich is a fav of my teens.
 The prices are perfect and Oh the donuts were  divine! Fresh warm and melted on your tongue.
My daughters always wants a  few doz. for the morning when having sleep overs. They ARE better than Krispy Kreme by far and BOSA is  open 24/7! 
 I did go in the afternoon one time and they weren't as fresh so  make it a morning trip!"}
{"text":"Not sure which Bosa my donut came from, but someone brought these into work. I had a glazed donut, which was still super soft and airy at 2pm. The glaze had a nice flavor to it, but I felt like the donut itself was missing something - if that makes any sense. The glaze did help carry the flavor of the donut though. I'm glad I got to try these donuts, but I probably won't go out of my way to try more from them since there's better out there. Definitely try it if you're driving by it though."}
{"text":"After receiving a flyer from Bosa Donuts. in the mail, we went to purchase 5 dozen donut holes advertised  for $5. Ringing up our order it came to more than the advertised price having an expiration date of January 31st 2017. I mentioned the flyer to the cashier she said they raised all their prices the day before - due to minimum wage increase. 
I knew that would happen in most stores but I thought if there was certain date on a flyer it's still had to be honored legally.
Since every employer knew when wage increase was to take place why send a mailer which your employees can not honor? I did express my displeasure but paid full price. 
At that time of night there was no one to complain to except the minimum wage employee. Who has no authority to make this right.
NOT A GOOD MANAGEMENT DECISION.
Food is excellent!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Bosa donuts, they are a family favorite weekend treat! I love the buttermilk bars especially when they are warm!"}
{"text":"The donuts are always fresh (the chocolate old fashioned is my FAVORITE!) and I had a DELICIOUS bacon, egg and cheese croissant this morning!  The bacon was thick cut and the cheese was better than most places.  Plus, it's the only place I know where I can get a Thai Iced Tea at 8:30 in the morning!"}
{"text":"BEST DONUTS EVER! love the old fashioned donut, and all of the jelly filled. The employees are very friendly and the donuts are to die for. A dozen donuts is around $8."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice. The attendant was friendly. The menu was easy to read. The taro boba was fresh and yummy! The doughnut holes were cheap and so damn good. I love this location. I love Bosa. 
This location is a far cry from the other on my DNR. This one goes for the addiction list hands down. I'll be there again soon, I only work 10 minutes away."}
{"text":"This review is from their drive thru menu. Be careful to really look closely at this chaotic display of a menu, you may think that something is one price and its actually another. 
The items and prices are so close together in and in different sizing it looks like they just slapped updates up there and hoped everyone would figure it out. 
I figured out I had made a mistake when I ended up at the window paying 5 bucks for a taro boba....with whipped cream that I wasn't given an option to decline (I hate whipped cream on drinks.) When I was completely caught off guard by the receipt handed to me, because the attended didn't let me know the cost before charging me and I stupidly had not realized that I hadn't followed their menu since everything was close enough to be mistaken for another price or item on there. I spoke up and asked about it, the attendant was rude about it. The boba was cooked well, however not enough of a pull for me to pay more and have to deal with rude service/chaotic menu. Eh. Another for the DNR list."}
{"text":"I am not kidding when I tell you, this place has the best doughnuts I have ever had! They are extremely fresh, soft, and moist. They have very good prices and a nice staff. If you need to stop for doughnuts before work this is your place....pick up a dozen and impress everyone at work!"}
{"text":"I love donuts!
So, when I heard there was a Bosa close to home I got excited. Boy, was I disappointed. I had heard such great things about their donuts... they were average (their apple fritter was better than average, however). The staff was very slow and needs to take a class on customer service. Rainbow donuts or the Bashas' across the street (seriously) is a better choice."}
{"text":"This place is just across the street from where I live and they stay open 24x7 making it our midnight salvation for some coffee and donuts.

The drive through is fast and this one time we got a box of their sugar, vanilla, glazed, Boston cream, chocolate bar and glazed twist. (Basically one of whatever flavor donuts they had left at that hour of the night) and the girl at the counter threw in a couple of more donuts for Free. SWEET!!! 

I also get their breakfast sandwiches, they are nice and fresh.Coffee is basic.The Service is great.
If anything I recommend going for the donuts,they have a lot of different flavors to choose from.You might just end up finding One you Like.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"These donuts are YUM! Support the local donut shops!"}
{"text":"Great donuts. They are always fresh and hot for a low price. I shouldn't come here as much as I do! Friendly lady behind the counter."}
{"text":"The donuts are top notch, would go all the time if donuts were in my diet haha! 

I'm a bit critical on customer service though when it comes to places so maybe you'll five star it, but I four star it because they could be a little friendlier at times. Some drive thru experiences have been bland where they don't even let me know the total at the end so I'm not sure whether to drive forward or wait, and then they give me a tone \"pull up to the window\" after sitting there.

But that's just being picky the donuts here are, again, the bomb. Glazed are always the way to go, or my favorite is chocolate icing with sprinkles."}
{"text":"These donuts are legit. Probably the best I've ever had. Small, old-school set-up with a drive-thru. Love it."}
{"text":"Good Donuts, moist and are your typical old school style but nothing over the top. It would appear that the company is trying too hard to saturate the market. Not sure in the long run they will monopolize the Donut world as they are pretty average. 

Service was lacking in people skills not sure whether the Locally owned Chain is paying attention and just concerned about opening up on every corner like a nail salon.

If its your first time and your thinking about checking it out.... I would say go check it out, but definitely not worth a return, there's other speciality Donut shops out there in the ever Evolving & Creative Donut World who do it way better."}
{"text":"Even though I've only been to Bosa once I've had the donuts from here several times.  My parents have been coming here regularly (like, multiple times a week regularly) since this place opened and every time I come to visit they make sure to get me donut in the morning when they know I'm hungover in bed.

Now, I'm only reviewing this place for the donuts.  I didn't even know this place served other breakfasty stuff until I came here myself, but the other pastries & coffee drinks sound good as well.  That being said, when it comes to donuts Bosa is as good as it gets.

They're soft, chewy, and all around yummy...that goes for all varieties (well, the ones I've tasted anyway).  Another good thing...they're CHEAP!  It's not like donuts break the bank anyway, but even compared to chain donut places the donuts here practically cost nothing.  

The place itself is not much to look at, but who cares!  All I want is the donuts!"}
{"text":"Best donuts in town, and really affordable to boot.  Come here at least a couple times a month!"}
{"text":"Great Donuts as always. The Sandwiches and Boba were great.  Staff was very nice and quick. Store is clean and inviting. Will definitely be a multiple times a week visit since I work a block away. Chatted with the owner for a bit and he's a cool guy with some great plans for the place."}
{"text":"Donuts, you evil mutants of dough, sugar and fried goodness.How I love you. 

 I was struck by the urge, late in the afternoon and where does one go for a fresh donut at 3pm...? Bosa and Bosa delivers some seriously fresh donuts at 3pm.

I went with the apple fritter and the boston creme...I had every intention to take the boston creme home to the trophy husband. And....I'm here to tell you the path to hell is paved with good intentions but not boston creme donuts bcz I ate them. Bosa does a very tasty donut. Enjoy."}
{"text":"We came here armed with a coupon for a free donut, and were impressed with the cleanliness and overall atmosphere of this little donut shop. The interior decor is very nice, with warm colored accents and trim, as opposed to the stark white walls and slightly dingy feel of other donut shops. 

In addition to donuts, they also have boba tea, coffee, and sandwiches. They are open 24 hours, and service was friendly and fast at this location."}
{"text":"They had a huge selection of donuts when we went tonight, and service was very friendly. The store is sparkling clean and Bosa Donuts in general are some of the best in Arizona. The decor isn't as nice as some of the other locations, but for service, cleanliness, and variety this one can't be beat!"}
{"text":"A very spacious and grand looking Bosa Donuts in the interior, there are a wide assortment of donuts, sandwiches, and drinks to choose from here. I had a long maple, and glazed vanilla cream filled. The maple was your standard Bosa long donut, tasty, with an even coating of maple on it. The vanilla cream donut had a pillowy, soft dough. I was disappointed that there was very little cream in it though. 

I also had an iced coffee with vanilla syrup. Unfortunately, I wasn't as impressed with the iced coffee, as it had a bit of a sour taste to it."}
{"text":"As others have stated their drip coffee is not their strong suit. I don't go there for coffee - I get their donuts come home and make my own :) However, their donuts are other worldly - they make a lot of different kinds. If its a donut they got it!  The place smells so good you almost don't want to leave. Awesome old fashioned plain cake donuts and their apple fritters just may be the best I've ever had - Epic!  Friendly service and always a smile when I pickup  - even early in the AM. Best donuts in town bar none!!"}
{"text":"Was visiting family and was really in the mood for some donuts. Saw good reviews and they were right. Donuts are delicious! 
Only gave four stars because although they advertised boba, they didn't have many selections. And the boba wasn't all that great. 
Really good place for donuts! Boba, not so much."}
{"text":"Yay! I never get a donut craving, but my husband is a pastry guy, so some weekends we get donuts.  It's so nice to have an option other than Krispy Kreme and. Dunkin Donuts ... Both to which I'd prefer a bowl of cereal or some yogurt.  These donuts are so big, doughy, delicious, and not overly sweet. The hours are great for us night shifters too! 24/7! 

Bosa also has kolaches! I can't wait to try them.  Now if only they'd make fruit and cream cheese kolaches, I'd have heaven less then a mile from my house, lol. 

The knockoff for one star is because I'd heard about and couldn't wait to try their specialty glazed blueberry cake donut. The girl kept trying to give me a blueberry muffin. I told her no, it's a blueberry donut. I saw the buttermilk donuts and a couple others that were on their website menu listed as their specialties. She just said, \"Oh, idk what that is. Blueberry muffin?\" ... Weird since I see other reviewers talking and tipping about it. Lol.

All in all, great fluffy pillows of dessert we like to call breakfast, 24/7. :-)"}
{"text":"Wow! Happy National Donut Day! I just left Bosa's with a smile on my face.  This place had great service. They were all friendly, smiling (even though they were very busy).  They had a huge selection of donuts but of course it's all about how they taste right!? I had the glazed which were warm and fresh from the kitchen and a chocolate frosted that was perfect.  Best ever! I also asked for a ham and cheese croissant with an egg for the road and that was amazing too! 5 stars for sure"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!!!

I never really like donuts until I had a krispy creme, and no donuts have ever been good enough when held to those standards... until now.

these donuts are amazing!

my coworker brought in 2 dozen of bosa donuts and I can't believe how good they are. very light and fluffy when biting into them. I tried a white sprinkle one, a chocolate sprinkle, and some cinamon crumbly kind - all tasted like heaven. 

much better than dunkin donuts

and they have a drive through too!"}
{"text":"Evil Donut Shop for selling donut holes for .99 cents a dozen.   EVILLLLLLLLLLLLLLL!!

I've only gone 2 times so far.  The first time not really counting because I went with a coworker and didnt buy anything.  BUT, I did ask if I could buy 2 holes (one glazed and one chocolate cake) instead of a dozen.  I sometimes have issues with fried items.  So I wanted to sample it first.  The gal just gave me the two and said, \"Enjoy!\"  I had no revenge of the holes the remainder of the day!  Wh00t Wh00t!   

But seriously, how awesome is it that she just gave me 2 holes.  

This morning, for some strange reason (the baby maybe ;) had me craving a donut.  So, off to Bosa myself and another coworker went!  I got a dozen holes (6 glazed, 6 chocolate) and a maple bar.  The maple bar I'm saving for tomorrow morning...i hope  

I honestly think the glazed holes are my favorite, reminding me of a Krispy Kreme glazed.  But glazed or chocolate...these donuts rock!  My coworker even thought so too.  

I would have taken a photo of the holes, but they didnt have a chance.  I eated them.  :)

I shall have to resist the urge to become a frequent BOSA customer!  RESIST Damnit.  RESISTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!"}
{"text":"What did one do before Bosa?  Oh,yeah, that's right.  DD.  I remember growing up my Gram would go pick up a dozen donuts from DD and we'd have donuts and hot rice for breakfast. Yes, rice for breakfast.  LOL  Makes me wish Bosa was a thing back in those days.  From Bosa's tasty little donut holes, which blow munchkins out of the water, to their fancy donuts...BOSA is Boss!  $1.xx for a dozen holes. Cheaper and better tasting than munchkins. My favorite regular donut? The maple bar, with second being the buttermilk bar. Tasty breakfast sandwiches.  Seriously.  Try the sandwiches!  I am near 2 locations.  This one and the one in Scottsdale. Flanked by tasty donuts. :)"}
{"text":"I'm going to be that person that writes a bad comment in a sea of good. Don't get me wrong, I love Bosa Donuts although I do prefer the location on McDowell. But on one particular incident a couple of months ago, at 2 AM I ended up ordering a Thai iced tea with boba while my friends also ordered the same. But rather in my drink I ended up with a dead fly floating in my mouth. By the time I realized this I ended up getting so sick that I wasn't able to drive back and complain. 

I love Bosa and I am a loyal customer. But I will never return to this branch again."}
{"text":"We call it \"Bitchy Donuts\" for their poor customer service, lack of friendly engagement and seemingly constant RBF on the employees. The donuts - epic. Apparently a friendly face is not a requirement to be employed here."}
{"text":"Oh man!  What a donut.  This was my first time visiting here and I was impressed.   Seriously can not believe how good they were.  The place was a little divey & old but the selection made up for it by far.  We ordered two dozen.  One we ate at the shop & one to take home to the guys.  Loved it."}
{"text":"Looking over all the rave reviews on this place and living so close, I figured there was nothing stopping me from trying out some fresh yummy donuts.  So, I dropped by after a long day at work.

I ordered one raspberry filled and a Boston cream.  They were oh so soft, moist, sweet, and they melted in my mouth.  I've never tasted a donut like this before.  I couldn't think of comparing them to anyone else.  I literally wanted to fall to my knees and thank God for these scrumptious donuts."}
{"text":"Although this place is out of the way it is worth the drive by far. I love the doughnuts here there is about 20 flavors. The buttermilk is my absolute favorite. One of the best donut shops in town!"}
{"text":"Boss doughnut is one of the best doughnut I've tasted! I highly recommend it. They're also open late(some locations) for your late night cravings! Rveryone go try!"}
{"text":"The ladies here are so nice and really patient with me while I try to decide which donuts I want! Donuts are great and always fresh tasting and so many flavors to choose from- we always leave with more than we need."}
{"text":"Solid donut spot. Will be back to try their drinks and other menu options I really liked the apple fritter and the classic glazed. However, the raspberry filled donut was not very tasty. It was definitely the filling and not the donut. Just had a chemical aftertaste. They offered an excellent selection even on National Donut Day, while other shops had sold out by 10am."}
{"text":"Love this location. It is newer and clean. The Thai iced tea with boba and cinnamon twist donut is my fave!!"}
{"text":"jalapeno ham and cheese croissant, old fashioned glazed donuts, and ice coffee.  Seriously, what else do you need in life?"}
{"text":"The BEST donuts ... Period!!  We think this Bosa location is the BEST Bosa in the valley. Been coming here for years, still hands down BEST donuts, sandwiches, and coffee. We think they're even better than LaMar's, but that's our opinion."}
{"text":"Very good doughnuts light fluffy and full of taste. Glazed were the ones for me!"}
{"text":"These donuts are so big it's like your eating a small cake. These are like gourmet donuts but you aren't paying a stupid amount for them. They are 99 cents each. You get stuffed after eating two of them. So this a great place to go if you are on a budget. Their iced coffee is amazing you can actually taste the coffee in it and it's got great flavor. Their crumb donuts are amazing, messy but so worth it."}
{"text":"Their donuts are huge guys you really can't eat more than two so you get your money's worth. They have fluffy donuts and then cake donuts. Also their apple fritters are spectacular. If you enjoy strong iced coffee you will love theirs. Their service is always amazing and they run very great deals. Just wish they had a stamp card of loyalty card"}
{"text":"I had a massive donut craving this morning and decided to bypass the Dunkin' Donuts on the way to try this place. 

I went through the drive-thru this morning. (I knew it had to be good because there was a cop in front of me). If you've never been here before it can be hard to miss. It's not a well thought out system being that the menu is out of reading distance when you go to order but if you've looked up the menu online beforehand you'll be golden. I ordered my half dozen assorted with 2 coffees. The wait time was around 5 minutes which seems like a long time for something premade but oh well. I'll agree with other reviews that customer service is blah.

Now to the donuts. I got 2 glazed, a strawberry covered, a chocolate covered, cinnamon roll & a raspberry filled. I've only had one of the glazed but OMG it was amazing. It really satisfied the donut craving I'd had for weeks. It's huge compared to its Dunkin' & Krispy counterparts and very hearty. Plus it was fall apart warm- so delicious!

All in all I would definitely return for another donut here but I would not go through the drive thru again."}
{"text":"The food is good in the smoothies are good but the service is always crappy. Every time I go there they don't greet me, they are rude, and they are inattentive. I just continued to come because I do enjoy the food and the drinks."}
{"text":"This is a place that people say \"has the best doughnuts\" but I thought it was just average. Not much flavor to them sadly."}
{"text":"Oh.my.god. Best donuts ever. The apple fritter makes me want to cry."}
{"text":"This is a nice neighborhood donut establishment. They have a nice variety of donuts and are available to help you with your sweet tooth no matter how early or late it hits. If you like Boba tea, you can find that here as well. We typically take our goodies to go but there is space to sit and enjoy your treat right there. The people working here are friendly and helpful. The donuts themselves are good but I'm removing one star because the Creme-filled are not consistently fully filled. I've had them with very little cream, which is disappointing. Other than that, no real complaints about this place."}
{"text":"When it comes to donuts, I am a bit of a traditionalist for the french cruller.   Bosa Donuts is the real thing.  This location just opened right down the street from the office so needless to say there will be no excuse now to bringing in treats on a Friday.  I will be back to sample some other varieties, the apple fritter looked great.  If there is a Dunkin Donuts near by, I think they will be in trouble once people taste what real donuts are suppose to taste like."}
{"text":"I'm what you call a donut expert. Okay, it's not among my college degrees, but I really think I'd make a damn good donut taster. Except I don't like jelly-filled or maple, so I'd probably be fired.

I'm a donut lover for sure, but it's more about the actual donut than the toppings. Sure, I love me some chocolate and who doesn't love sprinkles, but the DONUT. It has to be the right density. It has to have just enough sweetness to the dough. It has to be fried just right. Really, it's an art.

Bosa has it going on. They can make a basic donut better than most. I'm sure if they got all voodoo donuts crazy on us, it would be tasty too. But really, the au naturale donut they are whipping out every morning at o'dark early is cream of the crop."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place!  I don't know if I like the fact its drive through more than anything though.  The boba tea -taro- is my favorite and it's so hard to get the smaller size because you finish it too fast!  Donuts are great, and pricing is good for whole family."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times now. Mostly for their shakes (I always get boba) but sometimes I'll get a doughnut too. Staff is always friendly and the drinks are consistent, compared to some places that it's slightly different each time. The doughnuts are fresh and tasty as well! 
It's close to my new house now, so I'll be coming back for more very soon!"}
{"text":"Bosa Donuts lost a long time customer today. I was there during the 4pm hour, with my 10yr old son and 7yr old daughter. We had ordered 3 donuts to eat while there, then ordered another half dozen to take home. As I paid for the last 6 one of the workers began talking negatively about black people and used racist language in front of me and my children. The worker was not able to get the right order from a customer at the window. Instead of blaming the wind or bad tech, she blamed the woman's race - saying this is what it is like with Black people.  She didn't say it once.  Note even twice.  She said it THREE times to make sure I heard it. I told her to watch her language and to not be so hateful, especially in front of my children. Other customers walked in and I made sure they understood what was happening. The worker apologized and I said \"don't apologize, live differently.\"  Bosa, so sorry, but I will NEVER be back to this location, at least, and maybe the entire franchise."}
{"text":"I have been going to this Bosas location for almost a year. I take my bird for a weekly treat. :) the food is consistently great. The ladies that work there are very nice. The prices are very reasonable. I have been to the Bosas in Mesa and it terrible compared to the this one. People at this shop make all the difference. A+++ I highly recommend."}
{"text":"These is a weekly destination spot after an event at Kiwanis Park and it's a lot \"newer\" than the other Tempe location. The service is great, quality is good, can't complain"}
{"text":"I love Bosa Donuts, but who doesn't? This place is open 24/7 so you cannot beat it. You can get a dozen donut holes for $1, amazing breakfast sandwiches, homemade donuts, great coffee, and more. This place is great and an absolute must go for a grab and go breakfast. It is great when you are on the go. Great staff, good prices, and the best hours you'll find!"}
{"text":"bosa thai tea with no ice is what i order all the time. donuts are always on point. had their tuna in croissant. it was good."}
{"text":"Moved from California earlier this year.. Never had this good or quality and selection as Bosa Donuts does!  Awesome everything.. Love that they have shaved ice, and thai tea with or w/out bolba in it which my other half loves the boba in hers!  The Kids enjoy the donut holes and ham and cheese croissants warmed up.. Over all 5 STAR RATING for this establishment!!  Making this our weekly place to go for our fix haha!"}
{"text":"Delicious fresh donuts that taste absolutely delicious! My favorite donuts for sure ! Service is always friendly. I always use the drive thru because truth be told it's  a little shady inside. But their donuts are amazing! The old fashioned cake ones are to die for and theur double chocolate one too!"}
{"text":"Grand opening 9/9! Super great donuts and sandwiches! also good drinks. Ok AZ folks if this SC boy can find this new store you can too! head on over! In deference to Red Robin.....YUM!"}
{"text":"I cant get enough of these donuts! The apple fritter's are always the best! The glazed are absolutely incredible! Service and quality are always top notch! BEST DONUTS IN TOWN."}
{"text":"So good I should bribe the cop next time I get pulled over."}
{"text":"People are so passionate about their donuts, some like Dunkin Donuts, some like Krispy Kreme, some like them from their local grocery store and some like them from Bosa. I have to say hands down Bosa has the best dough. I bought my families request, chocolate glazed, regular glazed, cinnamon crunch and a jelly for me.

Again all were good my only comment was my jelly, though good, I do like the consistancy and flavor of Krispy Kreme's jelly better. Service was excellent, place looked clean, so glad they opened a Bosa in this location.

We'll be back, I'm sure, again and again. My daughter says the donut holes are to die for."}
{"text":"Homer Simpson would love this place!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of Bosa Donuts and so glad they finally opened one near me. 

These are literally the best donuts in Az.  What I love is you can taste that these are made from scratch and so fresh.  It doesn't matter which location you choose the staff are always friendly and eager to answer any questions. 

I have been going to Bosas since I was a little kid and it's so glad to know that a local business has thrived for so long and is doing really well and opening new locations every year."}
{"text":"Best Apple fritters around. I love the location at Ray and Arizona Ave. better than the other locations. Faster service, friendlier service and always have a lot of donuts to choose from. Always fresh too!"}
{"text":"Bosa donuts is known for having the best donuts around. I'm not entirely sure why because to me a donut is a donut but they open early and the donuts are always fresh. They also have croissant breakfast sandwiches too that are really good. The prices are great, the facility is clean and the staff is friendly. Check em out!"}
{"text":"This location is great! The coffee has gotten alot better recently, the donuts are of course the best compared to other donut brands and I love their breakfast sandwiches. Haven't tried the lunch sandwiches so I'll have to try those at some point. Service is generally friendly and somewhat fast. We'll definitely keep coming back."}
{"text":"To be honest, when I first passed by this Bosa location, my first thought was \"WHAT HAPPENED TO BARRO'S?!\"  Then I realized it was Bosa and everything was okay in the world again.

I love their crazy hours cause I managed to grab two dozen on the way to work and oh my god, did it smell amazing.  As soon as I opened the door of my car, in came wafting the smell of donuts.  The lady was crazy efficient in filling up the two boxes in under a minute.  Also kudos to her and whoever else who works that shift cause the morning sun comes flooding in, right into the store.  I mean, if I were in their shoes, I'd be wearing sunglasses indoors, I don't care if you think I'm a dbag.

All the donuts were fully stocked and were still really soft when I got to work.  Le coworkers were pleased and so was I.  Yay Bosa!"}
{"text":"Bosa, I deem thee my go-to place for all my late night donut cravings!  Bosa's affordable, with a dozen donut holes often going for 99 cents, always serving up the fluffiest, lightest donuts that will leave you craving more but...I wish they had a wider variety of donuts.  I don't think you'll find anything here that you can't find at any other donut shop, and with my late night donut cravings/habit, I'm usually left with only a handful of choices to choose from (though that's more my fault than theirs).  Still love them over many other donut shops in the area, mainly cause of their late hours and all of the fluffy donuts!"}
{"text":"Just opening the door and smelling that baked goodness immediately puts you in a good mood.  I think this is what heaven smells like. My favorite donut from when I was a little girl back in IL where there were lots of real bakeries was a sugar cinnamon twist.  They make it just how I remember!  The donuts are good sized and very well priced. It won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Best doughnuts in Phoenix! Made fresh daily and delicious to boot! Bosa is the boss!!
Bosa has the best doughnut holes in the world and my husband and son just devour their cinnamon swirls and long johns. Don't stop at Dunkinz... Head straight for Bosa!"}
{"text":"The thing about BoSa is that I always feel like I am eating day-old donuts. They are dry and not as fresh and I would think them to be. We come in on Saturday mornings, after my son's karate class. He loves the bag of donut holes, so we get a dozen of those. Other than the buttermilk donuts, I can't really say that I like anything else here. Its good for me because I am trying to lose weight so am not tempted as much, and my son seems to like them, which is why I am keeping it at 3 stars :)."}
{"text":"you must try the bear claw..which actually LOOKS like one.  I always say that I am going to have just 1 toe and I end up eating the entire thing.  You must try the tuna sandwich on the croissant.,  unbelievable.  Better than LGO!"}
{"text":"I think I expected too much from this place. Everyone talks so highly of it and it was just an average donut place to me. I got the ham croissant sandwich with cheese and the cheese was very creamy and melted. NOT what I expected but it was still good.  The kids all enjoyed their donuts. I do like that the hours are longer than most other donut places. I might just need to give it another shot and get an actual donut sometime."}
{"text":"Great place for inexpensive donuts and coffee.  Right down the street from Shadow Mountain High School so if you are not into lots of teens hanging out in the am and after school, You might want to go elsewhere.  Very friendly staff who make their own donuts in house rather than having them shipped in frozen like the other places.  The owners are from Vietnam so talking slowly will help as English is not their native tongue."}
{"text":"Went late at night (for dessert).  

Sampled several - and found the buttermilk donut to be easily my favorite.  All were good - but the buttermilk was the stand-out!

Can't compare Bosa to the other local donut shops (didn't try the others), but would certainly recommend Bosa to any Spring Training visitor to the area."}
{"text":"Love this donut shop!!! Chocolate donut with chocolate frosting and chocolate sprinkles heaven The Maple Bars I could go on and on you get it I love Donuts ..Open 24 hours usually go early mornings donuts and fresh and lots of variety can't go wrong with Bosa"}
{"text":"Been here for donut runs at literary all times of the day - from first thing in the morning to take a fresh dozen by a clients' office, to the late-night donut fix. Bosa has always been my go-to spot for donuts, and recently I've been dying to try their sandwiches too. 

Since the Bosa website, Yelp and Google ALL advertise that this location, similar to several others, is open 24/7, we opted to swing by for a spontaneous donut trip this evening. When we arrived at 10:30, we were all too disappointed to find that they were actually closed. 

Hours of operation are understandable, but I feel as though this is a key detail that should be updated on all of your platforms, at all times."}
{"text":"Great shop on 43rd avenue to visit. A lot of donuts all the time, and more than those as well. They have smoothies and other foods as well. Cool place to visit."}
{"text":"These donuts were fantastic. We were in the area on vacation and as is customary, I had to find a local donut shop. I could not have been more excited to stumble across this gem! My husband picked out an old-fashioned, chocolate-glazed donut. I grabbed a chocolate covered sprinkle raised donut as well as a chocolate-covered cake donut and I was blown away. Amazing crisp outside with soft inside, not too doughy and perfect frosting ratio. We were incredibly impressed, and the prices were great too!"}
{"text":"Always friendly and welcoming. I only wished they stayed open later. They have great Boba smoothies."}
{"text":"This place is simply awesome for a donut place !!! The donuts are delish , service was great . I tried their jalapeño ham cheese croissant and it was amazing to say the least .. I grabbed a dozen of glazed and mixed donuts for my class and it was a hit . Tasted great even after lunch . Simply put this is like a Krispy Kreme minus the hype , the IRS tax evasion and the priceyness ."}
{"text":"I've been craving a real donut for about a year , finally got it here !! Didn't want a Krispy kream or Dunkin donuts, wanted a fresh original recipe mom and pop shop donut . So yummy ! Not to mention the man working was very friendly (even at 5am ;) will be back !"}
{"text":"It's a cute place. Decorated like a Hawaiian hut on the side of the road, the vibe hit me when I first walked in. The donuts were fresh, actually some of the softest and moistest I've had. And considering I came in at 8am on a Saturday, service was very fast and efficient, even if my particular clerk was putting off the \"I'd rather be somewhere else vibe\". It's par for the course for a donut shop.

The donuts were solid. I tried a strawberry glazed that was the perfect amount of sweet, tasting enough like strawberry to satisfy my craving. The texture was dense and soft.  It was a good donut, even if I'd prefer a tiny bit more fluffiness in my bite. I'd get it again.

The old fashioned chocolate was also very dense and soft. Again, I was hoping for a more airy texture than I got. The flavor was good, it actually tasted like chocolate. Whatever they're doing to their frosting they need to keep up because it's very flavorful and delicate.

Solid place. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Looks closed from the outside. They had heavy, but much needed window tinting for Arizona. Open signs should be on the outside of these windows as well to assist, but this still wouldn't improve the quantity of donuts they were out of or the donut trays not matching the name on the display. 
Trying to order four strawberry filled donuts and getting lemon filled is quite a shocker."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years! Best donuts in the the world in my humble opinion. I would like to see them venture out and make those fancy donuts. Maybe a new flavor every month? Anywho I don't just come here for their donuts. I come for their Thai tea too so good!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness this place is not any closer to me or I might have a very serious problem.

Cinnamon twist, chocolate cake, all things raised and holes.  ALL are great.

The ham and cheese croissant was wonderful for lunch.

Made fresh, like still warm and melt in your mouth fresh.  Do yourself a favor and skip those big name donuts and go taste a real donut treat."}
{"text":"I only wish this place was closer to my house (or, maybe I don't).  If you're looking for a clean, top-of-the-line donut eatery, this isn't it.  But if you're looking for kick *** (you-know-what) donuts at good prices, then you'll be in heaven.  I strongly suggest the maple bar and the mini cinnamon roll--those are my favorites."}
{"text":"Tasty doughnuts. We liked the variety. Our favorites were the twists and apple fritters. I could have eaten a dozen of the apple fritters!"}
{"text":"best donuts ever.  The glazed is better than a krispy kreme and about twice as big.  They have lots of different flavors to choose from."}
{"text":"So i was really hoping for a great donut! Or maybe my taste for donuts is a little different than other peoples?
 When i want a donut i want sugar! I want the dough to taste good as well as the frosting or glaze i get on it. I was expecting to have the best donuts and was let down a little. The donuts are good, but the dough doesnt really have flavor it just taste like bland bread? Dont get me wrong this is my 3rd time trying them and each time the donuts were a bit off, so i did get them a few chances. I do like the different kinds of donuts they have. Chocolate and peanuts?! Ugh awesome! One lady told me it was a cherry donut and another told me it was strawberry. Whatever it is, its good! The original glazed is awesome. I like how they glaze it all over like Krispy Kreme. Sadly this did not take me away from Krispy Kreme donuts as i was hoping it would. Good donuts though i guess not good enough to bring Krispy Kreme to shame for me. Ah well."}
{"text":"this place is awesome inexpensive and i totally suggest you try a 24oz strawberry banana smoothie with a glazed twist not to mention their drive thru is open 24/7 suweet!! i've been here plenty of times and will continue to go"}
{"text":"I love apple fritters and Bosa donut's apple fritters are very good!"}
{"text":"Was running late for work and contemplated not stopping, but glad I did...was in and out with 2 dozen assorted donuts for my co-workers in less than 5 mins. I like Bosa because it reminds me of the old-fashioned style donuts like you I used to get from Winchell's."}
{"text":"Best Taro boba ever!!!! So bomb & the donuts are really good too. Service is terrible though and the lady working the drive thru at 4 in the morning is very rude and they barely had any donuts to choose from. Still coming back for the taro tea though."}
{"text":"Bosa Donuts... What can I even say... well the place isn't as fancy as those create your own donuts in front of you, it is pretty darn amazing. 

Everything here seems to be baked fresh and hopefully you're lucky enough to show up when the donuts are still warm. Besides just donuts they offer breakfast sandwiches, lunch sandwiches, and smoothies. The prices on all these items are really reasonable and I've never had one that hasn't been well prepared. I was initially hesitant but now I'm a regular to the bacon egg and cheese croissant. 

Personal favorite donut is the chocolate frosted old fashioned or chocolate bar. If your feeling fancy grab an apple fritter! 

I've only had coffee here a few times and I'm still skeptical - I'm a big lover of Dunkin Iced coffee but this place is growing on me more and more. 

Overall, good prices, great food, and tons of options."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast before my flight back to Texas and my boyfriend whom I was visiting here in Arizona for the first time said I had to stop by at a Bosa before leaving. Well I came in, the restaurant was very clean, asked for two donuts and a strawberry boba as I love my boba and was so disappointed!! The donuts were really dry and my boba tasted like straight up chalky powder! I took two sips and couldn't drink the rest it tasted so gross neither could my boyfriend. I was confused when I watched them make the boba as well as they made it in an usual way and the pearls were no good. )-: I'd probably give Bosa donuts another try when I make a visit to Arizona again but DEFINITELY at a different location."}
{"text":"The buttermilk bar is good. As for proclaiming these donuts to be five stars and worthy of such praise as other yelpers have heaped on them - I think not. If your measure of donuts is based on comparing Bosa to Dunkin Donuts and the supermarket, then yes, they are five star worthy. If you honestly compare Bosa to other donuts, many better ones come to mind. Randy's donuts in LA. K's Donuts in Sherman Oaks, CA is far superior. The Donut Man in Glendora, CA which features the strawberry donut - a moment please, for that is a donut. I think of my childhood when once in a while my mother would allow me to sin, and let me have the whole wheat donut at Chock Full O Nuts in NYC. That was a donut. When you compare Bosa to such American treasures, it falls flat and looks average. Sorry Bosa, although you made a valiant effort, in the world of donuts you fall in the same category as Winchell's."}
{"text":"ARGGHHH. I love to hate this place. Why? For starters, they are open 24 hours. Do you have any idea how dangerous that is? It's good for me they aren't right down the block.

But when I finally do decide IT'S TIME FOR A DONUT RUN at around, oh, 11pm, I make that drive of shame just to find out they don't have any buttermilk or maple bars left, so I have to settle for whatever they have left.

Which I then promptly cram in my pouting face. (It's not my favorite, but it's still a donut, guys!)"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed every Bosa location. However, this location has got it going on! They are soooo warm and friendly, their place is super clean, and their doughnuts have an extra something I just can't put my finger on. 

I had an iced coffee. It was very smooth and caffeinated me sufficiently. I also calorically splurged and got two doughnuts. The first was a chocolate cake doughnut with chocolate icing and peanuts. It was very fresh and had no funky aftertaste (some cake doughnuts have that!!). I also purchased an apple fritter. I think this may have been the best apple fritter I've ever had. The ratio of apples to dough was perfect! Oftentimes, the ratio of apples to dough is too low. 

Anyways, give this location a shot! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've never been one to be jonesing for doughnut holes, but these doughnut holes will have me struggling! They are light and fluffy, melt in your mouth, and not overly sweet. What makes them even sweeter is the price....one dozen for 99 cents?! Yep. Nothing more to say."}
{"text":"Three stars for being 24 hours and having donuts that don't hit your gut like a ton of bricks.  This place is friendly, has \"fluffy\" delicious sugary donuts, great prices, and changes up what they have on a daily basis.

I have been aware of their presence since high school (we won't mention when that was) and since mine was in the neighborhood, I was able to frequent this place.

Overall, if you are in the area, definitely worth a shot to see if your tastebuds require more."}
{"text":"These are the best donuts in town! 

They have everything your donut tastebuds are looking for. My favorites are the buttermilk bars, chocolate cake, and old fashioned chocolate, but they are all good. They also have sandwiches, teas, coffees and other goodies, but I have never bothered with anything beside the scrumptious donuts. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because their staff is incredibly unfriendly and act as if you are a burden. However this is quickly forgotten once you leave with your pink box full of beautifully fried sugary deliciousness!"}
{"text":"I am a self-professed donut junkie. I love donuts and will try them from local places whenever I can. Bosa definitely did not disappoint!

I had the Toasted Coconut Glazed and it was as fluffy and light as a cloud, with the perfect balance of donut and coconut flavors. I'd definitely go out of my way to eat one again! 

Also had the donut holes- it's a good thing that I only purchased a dozen. If it had been more, I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't have been to stop myself from eating every single one of them. Best donut hole I've had in a very long time. So good!

If you love or even like donuts, this is a must stop, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is my first time at Bosa Donuts, and I fell in love. They have great service. I am pathetically indecisive when it comes to choosing donuts, and it's more pronounced when I wanted to get half a dozen donuts togo. The lady there was so patient with me. I didn't feel rushed whatsoever. She happily pointed out my favorite donuts with white creme filling inside.

I left with more donuts than I can handle. I'll probably need to run an extra mile or maybe four to make up for this. No regrets. I will definitely be coming back. The best thing is it's open 24/7, and has a drive-thru. I can stop by during my night shifts at Chandler Regional this month for a donut/coffee run.

5 stars for affordable AND delicious donuts with great service."}
{"text":"This review is about taste only, as I can not speak for service or ambiance as the donuts were brought to me during a meeting at work this morning. When our Supervisor announced that she brought Bosa Donuts the room pretty much erupted in cheers of joy. I had never heard of Bosa, but the donuts looked good. I grabbed a jelly filled, and it was divine. The glaze was sweet and wonderful, the jelly was superb, and I loved loved loved the dough. I am now a Bosa convert, and will join in the cheering next time they are presented."}
{"text":"I took my 5 year old son here and this place is awesome!! I got a vanilla iced coffee and it was delicious. I am very picky about the quality of iced coffee drinks. This passed with flying colors. I also ordered a buttermilk donut, which was like a little pound cake/slice of heaven. My son enjoyed a chocolate frosted glazed with sprinkles and orange juice. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Every neighborhood needs to have a good donut shop. On Indian School Road is Bosa Donuts. With people lining up for these sugary treats. I saw people walking out with three to four dozen boxes of donuts at a time. All the greatest hits are here- maple logs, old fashioned, glazed, pink frosting with sprinkles. I was in donut heaven.
The service is fast and friendly. There were two to three employees helping customers get their donuts at the same time. So your in and out with a dozen donuts and a coffee in no time. They also have a drive through.
Support local business especially the good ones. In this neighborhood they have Bosa Donuts and the neighborhood is better for it. Get your donuts here."}
{"text":"Everyone needs a sugar fix-best donuts in town!  The coffee is so good you can drink it black.  And their egg sandwich/coffee/donuts deal-can't be beat!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so who goes to a donut shop for ambience or class? This is where dough is deep fried and sugared and it's beautiful. Phenomenal donuts. Good coffee. Fast staff. They do donuts right."}
{"text":"They have taro boba (among other flavors) and a drive-thru.  Its every Asian woman's dream come true.  :)  If you're not fond of whip cream, remember to ask for no-whip at the time you order."}
{"text":"Best donuts in area, and I don't care for donuts in general but Bosa is the exception.  Also, lunch sandwiches are great!"}
{"text":"Great tasting donuts and a nice variety. Easy parking, a drive-thru window, and great customer service. They even let me have a few boxes to pull an April Fool's Day prank on my co-workers."}
{"text":"Thes are gud donuts but they  had holes in the middle very weerd but my wife tell me to try new stuff so it ok. I gib this place 5 holes hahah HOLES LOL"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite donut spot in AZ. I usually go to the one in Ahwatukee because it's closer to home, but this one is definitely my favorite. Whether it's early morning or late at night, they always have the freshest and warmest donuts. WAAAAAY better than Dunkin Donuts and Krispy Kreme. The staff is friendly and very prompt!!"}
{"text":"Best donuts in town! You have to try the apple fritters! It is like heaven in your mouth. 
The owners are always friendly. 
The coffee and boba are also delicious. 
Writing this review makes me want to go get a donut right now!"}
{"text":"This must be the ghetto bs donuts. Every other location is so much better. Every time I go, they are always out of buttermilk and coconut cream and ...pretty much everything else."}
{"text":"Best donuts in town. Family owned so they take pride in what they make!! All of their donuts are good so you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Good donuts and pretty fast service. Nothing fancy, just sugar sweetness.  Iced coffee is ok but not as good as going to a coffee shop."}
{"text":"Went tonight and nice supply of donuts and always fresh. Smoothies on point and there sandwiches on a crescent bun excellent will definitely be by a again"}
{"text":"Donuts are delicious, my wife has yet to find any better in the East Valley. However, service is lackluster and the Boba Tea is foul. So, skip the boba, but enjoy the donuts. If you really want to kiss up at work, pick up a dozen on your way in. Seriously; my department has a donut club who take their confections seriously, and their rule is that donuts must be of \"Bosa or similar quality\". We haven't had a bad donut yet, we especially enjoy the twists, Bavarian Creme filled, and maple bars."}
{"text":"I moved down here recently and loved the donuts! I'm not really a sweets person, but it was breathtaking for sure! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Found a coupon for this place on the web, realizing it was expired on my commute, I decided ah what the heck! I'll check it out :) boy am I glad I did ...couldn't believe I got a dozen little donuts for 99 cents, yumm also I ordered their equivalent of a mocha frappuccino and was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  Bosa always has the freshest, largest pastries.  These are not donuts made at a factory and then shipped to individual locations.  My favorite type of donuts are jelly filled.  Bosa always guarantees there will be actual jelly in the donut.  It's not like Dunkins or Krispy Kremes where all the jelly is in one little blob at the very back of the donut.  These have a good jelly to donut ratio.  

Really, every flavor I've ever tried here is good.  Their glaze is melt in your mouth amazing.  And they even have options if you prefer savory options.  Sometimes my hubby and I will go here before the grocery store for breakfast and just grab a ham, cheddar, and jalapeno filled croissant.

The staff is always pleasant and will do their best to accommodate special requests (like my husband asking that his croissant be warmed up).  Definitely stop in when you get a chance!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Bosa. They are open 24 hours a day and their Bagel sandwiches don't mess around. Delicious!"}
{"text":"You must try these donuts. I never crave sweets and this is all I crave ALL DAY LONG! AZ doesn't have these sort of donut places...we are stuck with Dunkin Donuts that are crusty and dry from a day before!!! Crispy Kreme...they are good but don't taste like an old fashioned...REAL donut. Please check this place out. I get glazed every single time because I love them so much I won't try anything else! It's like these donuts are thicker, I can't put my finger on it, but something makes these so good! It's like the donuts you would have as a kid. And you know when the glaze is all cracked and dry!?!? NOT at BOSA! Go to Dunkin for that! :) The coffee is also my favorite out there. My boyfriend get's the croissant sausage and egg sandwich and he loves it! Please check this place out. I have convinced several friends/family to just try one donut at this place and all of them are addicts now! Don't miss this! :)"}
{"text":"Best donuts in Arizona. Have tried most of the donuts and they have all been amazing."}
{"text":"I've had donuts from other Bosa Donuts locations, and I would say these are as fresh and tasty as I've come to expect from this chain. My only regret is that they don't carry kolaches like their Texas stores. I love the sweet donuts here, but I could really learn to love a savory donut (kolach) even more (hint, hint... Mr. Bosa, if you're reading this).

So happy that this store moved in to the old TruWest building on the SW corner of Dobson & Elliot to give Dunkin' Donuts (just up the block... E on Elliot) a run for their money. I have been disappointed by Dunkin' Donuts in the past, and I finally got to validate this by my own form of the Pepsi Challenge. It was a Friday, which is traditionally the day that my co-workers will bring donuts to work. I swung by Bosa and got a variety of a dozen donuts. A fellow co-worker brought in Dunkin'. By the end of the day, there were no Bosa donuts to be found, only leftover Dunkin'. Sorry DD, you lose...

If that isn't testimony to the quality and homemade freshness of these donuts, I don't know what is."}
{"text":"I hope that enough people with regular taste buds review this new location so that the one bogus review gets buried as it should be. 
I stopped in with my two kids, ages 13 and 11 for a free donut during their grand opening. My son described his donut, the Boston cream, as a \"chocolate cloud with a creamy filling\", both my daughter and I couldn't respond to his assessment because we were busy shoving donuts in our mouths.
I've never had a more amazing donut, it beats Krispy Kreme and Top Pot and any other donut shop. Prepare to be amazed!"}
{"text":"Typical donut shop that offers all the sweet treats one can imagine, with good pricing and always in stock. Every time I come in it's always the same sweet gal working, and she always manages to greet everyone with a friendly, warm, and sincere smile. Excellent customer service. Whenever I am craving a sweet treat, this is my go to place. On lovely days, it's fun to pack the donuts up and go next door to Kiwanis Lake."}
{"text":"Bosa has really great donuts! I love more simple ones, so the glazed twist is usually my go to! The ladies working behind the counter are also extremely nice and friendly. For their donuts, I would rate a 4, but because of their boba tea, I've rated them a 3.

My only complaint is about the boba tea. My usual boba tea order from any establishment is \"Thai Tea,\" - a sweet, milky, orange-coloured, iced tea. 

Bosa's Thai tea is usually too sweet for me. However, since I live near by and I'm too lazy to make it at home, I occasionally buy it to satisfy that crave and just add some more water.
In contrast, the boba they make is flavourless and sometimes the texture feels too soft (like they over boil them). I'd say they don't add enough sugar, but it tastes like they don't add any, at all! 
Other places that offer boba tea either add enough brown sugar or make honey boba - these sweeter versions make a huge difference. Also, the texture should have a nice firm chew to it. 

Hope this was helpful!"}
{"text":"Worst donut wholes ever served here. More mold on my donuts then the rocks at the bottom of the lake. I love bosa donuts but this is the worst branch in the state, i know they franchise and each owner takes care of them individually bt the service here is awful and stale donuts. i rather go to rainbow donuts or the other bosa on 40st and indian school."}
{"text":"Bosa has some of the best doughnuts around for sure.  I love the fact that they have sandwiches as well and they are very good.  Every Bosa that I have visited, the staff has been great, the doughnuts have been fresh, and the places have been super clean."}
{"text":"As a long time glazed doughnut lover, I have to say that Bosa has some of the best doughnuts in town.  Although at times the drive thrus can be snarled from customers trying to choose from the all the goodness, they have held the course.  A must try and they are expanding all over the valley"}
{"text":"Great little local donut shop! 

I always get the donut holes and maybe a chocolate sprinkled donut! I've heard the coffee is pretty average but I can't write a fair review about it because I don't drink coffee. The service could be better but I understand when the place gets busy..."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 3 stars because of my experience today... I come here a lot for PTO meetings, family time etc... Today I'm in here to just work a little for a change of scenery and this is what I get... A workers son jumping from table to table and watching really inappropriate YouTube videos REALLY loud on his iPad.  Awesome.  The kid is running around the restaurant with just socks standing and jumping on the tables. Gross!"}
{"text":"Super awesome deals on doughnuts! I love their glazed doughnuts that just seem to melt in your mouth. I try not to drive by this place because I know I'll be tempted to stop in and buy some sugary sweets. They have really awesome deals on doughnut holes! I'll always get a big box to surprise my man before I come over, they're delicious! When I lived in Gilbert I would go to the one out there and it was just as good as this one. I love Bosa!"}
{"text":"This Bosa Donuts is my favorite local donut shop in Arizona. I stop here in the mornings sometimes on my way to work (if I leave early enough). I love that they have a drive-thru and the customer service is wonderful every time. They always get your order out super fast, I'm usually out of there in less than 3 minutes! I usually stop by around 7:30 and I think that's when the donuts are fresh because they come out so warm, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I always get a maple bar and a cappuccino to go along with it (warning: cappuccino is scolding hot!). They have a lot of different things on their menu that I want to try one day just haven't ventured off to do yet. Their croissants filled with ham and cheese looks amazing and if its quality is anywhere near their quality of donuts, I'm down. They also have boba drinks that I am curious to try, considering donut shops don't usually serve boba I am not expecting it to wow me, but if it does more power to Bosa! I had my favorite donut shop growing up in California that I always went out of my way to go to and I was so happy to find one here! Bosa Donuts, you will be the fat death of me, but I forgive you. Because you are delicous and filled with happiness."}
{"text":"The stars are given purely because I love donuts. The attitude from the women who work there is not appreciated. When you work customer service, you act happy to be where you are and don't make others feel like a bother if someone says they aren't finished with their order but you rush them and say \"go to the window for your total\". Also, when you run out of pina colada don't make the customer feel like an asshole for asking for it."}
{"text":"Good donuts, but the service could be better. I brought in a \"buy one, get one donut free\" coupon and they refused to honor it because \"they had a different owner\" or something to that end. I paid and walked out, but the coupon did not specify that it was only valid at certain locations. All that aside, I feel like any good business worth returning to would honor a coupon with their name on it. Nice and clean location, but I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Good doughnuts for and good price. Employees are so nice and helpful. Great little place."}
{"text":"These are the best donuts we have had in the valley. They are just the freshest and softest donuts ever. Definitely recommend if you are a donut lover which I am not, but these are darn good."}
{"text":"I tried Bosa Donuts for the first time today.  Fortuitously we arrived just as some donuts were nearing the completion of their magical doughy journey through the wondrous worlds of Oiliverse and Sugartopoliis.  They were hot, fresh and delicious.

For the donut connoisseur in you I will make some comparisons.  The Bosa glazed, when fresh, certainly rivals Krispy Kreme's glazed donut.  It has less of a sugary coating than Krispy Kreme's, it is larger in circumference and slightly doughier.  In fact, the doughiness of the Bosa is somewhat reminiscent of something you might find at a state fair, though not as heavy.

The Bosa compares favorably with the Dunkin' Donuts glazed varietal.  Indeed, it is far fresher and wholesome tasting than any glazed I've had from the big D.

The store itself does not exude cleanliness nor inspire confidence in the behind the scenes preparation areas.  Sometimes you have to take it on faith and the word of the local Health Department.

Service was on a par with any other similar business."}
{"text":"I have been picking up a friend that lives close to Bosa. He practically begs me to stop every time we go by. 

This is a great donut house. They love their costumers and I think of it as fortune, to find nice places that offer something good. 

Ya, every once in a while I crave the sugar coated orbs, lol."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this place at all man....everything I have tried here is fresh out of the oven and the taro bubble tea is the shizz I'm in luv. :P"}
{"text":"Do not buy the Iced Thai Tea Boba. The boba was very stale and hard in the center.  I wanted to like you, Bosa Donuts at Riverview!"}
{"text":"Ive been to a few Bosa in the valley. This is by fare the nicest one! I had no clue they was open 24/7 wow! This might be bad for my diet. The donuts and coffee at all
Bosa locations are amazing taste wise. . The atmosphere on this one is A+. Many trips here.The coffee is priced the same as Starbucks. Since theres no Starbucks close I think they are taking full advantage of the coffee price. I adjusted to 4stars because of this. Please make coffee affordable."}
{"text":"Things have improved at this location dramatically.  The staff members have either been replaced or trained and no longer confused by their own menu.

The donuts are absolutely delish and so much better than the Dunkin across the street.  I'll still go there for iced coffee and breakfast sandwiches but when I crave some gooey donut Bosa is the spot."}
{"text":"I've actually only been here at night, but the staff at night has been pretty dismal. The last woman who rang me and my friend up was kind of rude, didn't even greet us, and seemed like she didn't even want to be there. I get it, you're working at a donut shop at 10 PM on a weekday, but at least be courteous and act like you at least care. The donuts are okay. Maybe they are better in the mornings, but they're alright at night. It's the closest donut shop to me so I'll take it haha."}
{"text":"Rude staff. Mediocre donuts. Definitely nothing to brag about. I've had better donuts from QT."}
{"text":"This place might be the death of me. Great breakfast sandwiches. Great croissants. Ham cheese and jalapeno  it's amazing. Great bacon egg and cheese croissant. Although the drive-thru was made for a little Miata or MG it is difficult to get a large vehicle through there.  As long as the croissants are that good I will keep trying to get through the drive-through."}
{"text":"The only place in Phoenix to get doughnuts!!!! Plus the ice cream and slushies are super yummy!! If the food and drinks weren't enough , the staff is super sweet and helpful ! This is worth the stop in the morning before work ! If you haven't been you have to check it out. You won't wanna go anywhere else for doughnuts!"}
{"text":"Yum. This is just what I was looking for. There don't seem to be many donut stores here, or maybe they're just spread out. This place is great, and worth a little drive from my house. Excellent donut quality. They have all the variety you would hope for and taste so fresh. They also serve coffee and milk and even boba. AND they have a drive through.
UPDATE: They could be even better if they had real espresso drinks. Found out today while trying to order a \"cappuccino\", which comes from a machine and cannot come without sweetener and a fake flavor. Why is it so hard to find a place with good baked goods AND good coffee/espresso?"}
{"text":"Sigh, what's a girl gotta do to get some decent late night boba? My first two visits here were great, the guy was super nice and my Thai iced boba tasted amazing. Last week, I was greeted by a high school girl who had the decency to ask me if I needed anything in the most obnoxious voice. Of course I'm here for something, how rude of her to even ask that. Tonight, I asked for a Thai iced boba and the girl gave me my drink with raw boba. Hardly edible; I asked her to make it again and to actually cook the boba but sadly, the second drink still contained raw boba. Don't bother getting any boba if you see a bunch of high schoolers working."}
{"text":"These guys have some yummy donuts and the prices are great.  Their donuts seems to be more authentic... they feel more hand made than machine made.   I'll be back."}
{"text":"I am not getting these good reviews... Maybe they're just not as on the ball in the morning as they should be... I felt like I was being talked down to the whole time. I entered and others followed, I made sure to walk far away from and turn away from the counter to signal I'm not in line but instead of a ma'am I realize I'm just being stared at by staff and I think I could have kept staring for awhile so I just said they can all go. Then since there are no labels and I'm not a donut connoisseur or psychic I had to... I don't know ask what they were with filled with? I asked for what flavor something is but I got it on my other donuts instead and had to repeat over and over that it was a question.  Next I attempted to order a sandwich, I had to explain I only wanted one sandwich even after saying the specifics and describing the picture. I asked what was on it and like duhhh \"everything you see there\" oh I'm sorry the tiny picture across from me that is CLOSED face tells me everything. Whatever, fine... I finally pay and wait for it wait for it, because I sure did, I'm asked why I'm still there, I don't know... Waiting for my sandwich... Got it, wasn't appetizing, thank you, bye."}
{"text":"Best variety of donuts. Nothing super fancy or crazy, so you know what your getting with Bosa no matter what!"}
{"text":"I've ridden my bike up Arizona Ave many of times and after a quick rip to the barber shop for decided to pedals to the more recent location to grab a sugar boost for the ride home! 

The old location was just north of Ray and since the move to the new location which is about 1/2 mile south on the east side i honestly feel like not much has changed. 

Still our go to spot for donuts and beverages. Chocolate iced is still my favorite along with some glazed donut holes... the fritters are good and it all goes well with some chocolate milk. 

I've had the breakfast sandwiches via my coworkers for our weekly breakfast and they did t disappoint. 

Staff on hand when we came was great and it was a grab and go! The inside is clean and spacious so plenty of room."}
{"text":"Walked in to get a dozen donuts this morning... not one word (hello, we'll be with you in a minute, good morning...NOTHING...!) from any of the 3 staff working and I was the only walk in customer. I stood there for at least 2 minutes and no one even looked at me. It was as if I was invisible. Walked out and WILL NEVER go to any Bosa donut shop again. Would rate them negative if possible. I can't believe they stay in business."}
{"text":"Overall great experiences each time I have gone here.

I think the donuts are good, not great. The one thing I wouldn't ever buy again is the breakfast sandwich. Although, what I think is great is the blueberry muffins!

Staff has always been friendly. This location could be a little cleaner- when I go in at 6am, I don't think I should see last nights customer food droppings on the floor, take a broom to it. 

As far as coffee goes it is good. It's your overall basic taste, not too bitter or dark roast taste (not too sure what brand they use but it's good). I drink Starbucks a lot at the moment because it's close by but I'm not too much of a fan and would rather drink bosa's honestly."}
{"text":"I love Bosa! The owners are very kind and generous and the donuts are amazing! My only criticism about Bosa would be that sometimes it can get very crowded especially late in the night."}
{"text":"(Only reviewing the donuts and drive thru experience. I've never had the time to dine-in here.)

These donuts really are the best in AZ. Always fresh, soft, and really delicious. I did a taste test with my friend and these aren't quite as sugary sweet as Krispy Kreme. Not dripping with glaze. I don't like too sweet though...I can't handle a lot of sweetness...a good donut has a balance. 
Nothing too fancy here--my friend wanted a cookies and cream Oreo fancy kind of donut--well this isn't the place for that.

This is where you get a really good basic donut. Glazed, chocolate, sprinkles, fritter, jelly-filled, long jon. I've never been disappointed.

Staff has always been so pleasant and friendly. Sometimes they've thrown in a couple free donut holes for my kid. So nice.

I have to note that I used to visit the Indian School location all the time and these donuts taste exactly the same. Can't say the same for all BoSa locations, but the doughnuts at these two locations taste consistently delicious."}
{"text":"I was leaving Rubios tonight and felt like something sweet. I yelped for nearby donuts and this place showed up, and was only .5 miles away. I used the drive thru since I was stuffed from dinner, and wanted to eat the donuts at home. I got two sugar and one chocolate covered with sprinkles. The lady who helped me was sweet, fast and friendly. I felt like a kid again seeing pink donut boxes in the back! Their donuts are the real deal! Soft, fluffy and melts in your mouth. The price was decent too about 80 cents per donut. My total came out to around $2.50 for three donuts. Not too bad. I will definitely be making the 15 minute drive for these delicious treats in the near future."}
{"text":"They use to be really good. I did stop in and Purchased a donut and coffee. But Don it wasn't as good as they used to be"}
{"text":"Great place and service, real clean, owners & staff are amazing.Open 24 hrs, Donuts 
Are all homemade."}
{"text":"Best donuts. Ever.
I mean... It is great. And their croissants are really good too!

And its cheap! Definitely go.. this review isn't 100% helpful bc all i can say is.. they were good."}
{"text":"Checked out Bosa donuts recently for the first time and was impressed. Arrived at 3pm and expected donuts to be fresh but not this fresh. They were sweet and tender. Super soft. Good selection of classics with a few original variations. Place was quiet, but I imagine that during peak times this place is hopping.  But glad it wasn't crazy so i could take my time picking my treats. Had a glazed donut with toasted coconut. Delicious. Went back for another one, their glazed cinnamon crunch that was super soft and yummy. Lastly we had the buttermilk glazed. It was like a sweet glazed cake. Definitely will be back! Sorry no pics, they went in my mouth too fast!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been to Bosa a few times since moving to Phoenix. The donuts are usually really good especially when they're right out the oven. So, in terms of taste, Bosa donuts are as unhealthy and delicious as they can get. They have pretty decent flavors as well and it's really cheap. For two donuts, we usually pay 1.90. However, I'm pretty big on customer service and the customer service just isn't there. A lot of times it seems like they don't want to be working or as if they don't want to make any business. For that reason I had to take off a star."}
{"text":"Worst experience! Love Bosa Donuts on 32nd and Shea so when they opened a Bosa near my house I was excited. To celebrate National Donut Day, I went in early around 6am to get 2 dozen donuts as a surprise for my coworkers. Besides the customer service being slow and not friendly, they are also incompetent. I asked for a receipt and they gave me multiple receipts of other patrons. When I check my bank app I realize they charged me over $50 for my donuts. I end up returning to the store the 3rd time and the manager finally said she could text me my corrected receipt and refund my card for difference. Of course she sends me some other guys receipt. I go back to the store (for the 4th time) and get my receipt sent to me again. By this time I'm frustrated and just want my refund and receipt. The manager there could care less that I have wasted my morning dealing with this issue. She gives me the owners number, who of course doesn't call me back. No empathy or service at this location and obviously horrible management. My fault for trying them out. If you want donuts in the area, stick to Rainbow on 64th, Dunkin on Greenway or even the Bosas on Shea....anywhere but this location!"}
{"text":"Simply one of the best places to get donuts! Have been coming here since I was a kid. The best part is the donuts still taste the same, all soft and fluffy just like a donut should be. You won't be disappointed when you come here! It's a smaller place but worth the wait :)"}
{"text":"Bosa Donuts are great!  

I love their buttermilk bars, apple fritters, boston cream donuts, and donut holes!  

The Thai Iced Tea is good too... the boba was a little chewy one time and mushy another.  

And.. although I'm Asian, sometimes it is hard for the workers to understand me......."}
{"text":"Bosa is always good. Every location is consistent and delicious. My favorites are always the apple fritters and buttermilk bars. But they have a solid glazed too!"}
{"text":"Very good donut and service with a smile. Nice and clean. Restroom nice and clean also"}
{"text":"On a best apple fritters hunt and everyone says Bosa Donuts...they're right!!! These are the most apple-y, completely glazed, freshest tasting fritters in AZ!!! And the price is only .99¢ for one!!! Beats the heck out of my home town donut shops on flavor and price!!! No wonder this local chain has about 20+ locations and some if not all have a drive-up window that's open 24hrs!!! Now these aren't the upscale fancy Voodoo style donuts that cost $5-10 each, these guys make the standard everyday donuts but make it better than anyone! Went to the store in Gilbert and they make 2-sizes: a .99¢ regular one and a mammoth sized one that's only .39¢ more!!! If you have a hunger for some excellent donuts after all night at the bars stop at any of their locations and buy some of the best donuts I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"This is new to the area and so worth it. I like it more than Dunkin donuts. Love the drive thru and the donuts melt in your mouth"}
{"text":"the thai tea with boba is good but the lady who works there was giving me attitude & looks i felt uncomfortable i also saw her drink out of a customers drink & gave it to them."}
{"text":"Incredible. As they were building this donut site. I passed it everyday on the way to school. I thought to myself: stay away--don't even look at it. I did so well for the last 5 months but then....unfortunately I ended up with visions of donuts dancing in my brain last night (couldn't sleep, and had recently watched \"Boogie Nights\" for the umpteenth time--you know, the part where Don Cheedle stops to get his preggie GF some donuts?) and thought, Ok, it's Sunday AM, Dad used to get them all the time. I'll just get a couple in the morning. I went, I saw, I became ravenous, I ordered...a dozen for a little over 7 bucks. How could I resist? 

These donuts kick butt. Amazing. DD has no clue compared to this place. The rasp. filled was devoured the minute I got home. The only complaint? (thus the 4 stars), was that the Asian lady helping me said out of the blue \"you have baby?\" I looked at her like, WTF? She said again, \"you have baby?\" I asked her if she was asking if I was pregnant (not a good question to ask a woman who just ordered a dozen donuts...esp. when she IS NOT), or if I already had \"baby\"? she then said \"before?\" I looked at her and said, \"why in the world are you asking me that question?\" She says nothing. I was tempted to ask her if she had hemmorhoids, but instead I walked out with my donuts checking my side reflection in the mirror (stomach, flat), pre-donut scarf. It was almost a total buzz kill, but I recovered by the time I got home. Maybe it was my hefty busoms, or maybe she wanted to make a trade, who knows.

Note to Asian lady--don't ask strangers about their baby making capacities while they are ordering your donuts-- or no tippie for you!
Your donuts rule, though!"}
{"text":"Have to say that their service has improved a lot. Order has been correct and they seem to take pride that they are the spot on Baja Arcadia for doughnuts. Haven't been hard selling the up sale and polite and courteous over the past 4 months. Kudos, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Solid boba tea, not sure how the donuts are.

Customer service could definitely improve."}
{"text":"Best donuts I've ever had in AZ!  I can't say enough about them.  The breakfast sandwich was reheated in the microwave, which is why I didn't give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"I am glad I do not live close to this donut shop.  With the 24 hour drive thru, excellent selection of donuts, boba drinks, and even shaved ice available all day it is a diet killer.

I stopped by late, about 10pm  and they still had a large selection of donuts, I picked up a dozen to \"sample\" the flavors.  I enjoyed the old fashioned, Boston creme, chocolate filled, raspberry filled, and some classic sugar laden regular donuts.  Delicious and I was on a sugar high.

To add to my sugar high I added a boba Thai coffee large.  Pretty of boba to enjoy my long drive back to the west valley.  I really enjoyed the coffee and it is a rare treat by my home.  I am still craving another excuse to drive here and get another.

I also did sample some shaved ice in the unconventional rainbow fashion. The staff was not use to serving a rainbow shaved ice, but were very accommodating.  He noted they usually only do one flavor, but attempted a 4 flavor ice sample.  It is still great to have shaved ice at 10pm when its 50 degrees outside right?

I also noted breakfast croissants and other breakfast treats, bagels and creme cheese, etc.  I could not really concentrate on that part of the menu, the donuts in the glass cases are mesmerizing.  I imagined sampling them all while I reduced my selection to only 12 donuts.  

I can say that the 12 donuts did not last a day on the kitchen island and the donut box is now a empty box of memories.  I hope to visit Bosa again and enjoy another dozen and maybe sample some other items they provide.  I hope you have the opportunity to sample Bosa donuts as well."}
{"text":"I've ignored this little gem for over a year, and never bothered to try it until me and a friend had a sugar craving at 4am and saw reviews on Yelp.

We both got Bostom Cremes and a dozen donut holes. Best Doughnut we have had in Chandler. And the Donut Holes are great. 

They also have Boba Tea and Boba Slushes. Boba at 4am is amazing."}
{"text":"Very fresh and great tasting donuts.  Wonderful customer service.  Believe it may be family owned.  A regular stop for us.  By far, the best donuts in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Donuts are delicious, new location is better and the employees are nice, they can just be a little quicker. My favorites are the Boston creme donut and apple fritter."}
{"text":"Excellent donuts at new location.  Breakfast also offered at this Bosa location..  Friendly staff eager to please.  Plenty of room and comfortable for a good cup of coffee  with outstanding variety of super tasting donuts."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's terrible that I live walking distance haha!!! I love that they have a drive thru. Their donuts are always fresh!!!! Coffee is good but if you get flavoring they add a ton of sugar so I just ask for less now. My kids & I love this place and have been many times. Their breakfast sandwiches are awesome too. Price is good for what you get."}
{"text":"Bosa Donuts are the biggest, best donuts on the planet."}
{"text":"We travel to Arizona for spring training every year, my daughter introduced us to Bosa Donuts, and they are the best donuts ever! We will frequent this business every year we're in Arizona for spring training.  I don't eat a lot of donuts or other fatty foods; however, I make an exception because these donuts are really the best.  I highly recommend this donut shop you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great customer service this morning when I picked up my faves: French crullers and apple fritters. They're always fresh and perfect with their coffee. They do have the best doughnuts in town!"}
{"text":"Just found a fingernail in my donut. Gross lol. Good donuts but not with a fingernail in them. They just said, \"That's not my fingernail, sorry.\" Probably gonna go find donuts anywhere else lol."}
{"text":"Hot, delicious donuts available 24/7? Bosa Donuts, you had me at hello! I went for the classic glaze with chocolate milk and my partner-in-crime ordered a chocolate sprinkle with strawberry milk. Total cost = $5 and change and a perfect end to our night! *****5 Stars."}
{"text":"Num num num.  I love my boba drinks and they get it right here.  I'm not much of a doughnut guy but they do about as good as Kristy Kream so hats off"}
{"text":"Great place! Our fav donuts in the whole state! The people are super nice and the donuts are always fresh."}
{"text":"I'm not a donut person. I initially tried Bosa for the coffee. As an avid coffee drinker, I enjoyed their mocha smoothie! Not too sweet, but strong enough coffee to help you get through your day. Now I've tried their donut selections and they are all yummy. Great customer service and always welcoming when I order. Now I get their mocha smoothie EVERYDAY, and when I feel like splurging, I'll order their old fashion donuts! This place will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Best Donuts in AZ! My husband is addicted! They are always fresh and delicious! We try to limit our intake but just can't resist some days when we are craving a treat!"}
{"text":"I love bosa donuts but I feel like this is my favorite location! Never frozen, always fresh. Bosa has spoiled me and now I can't get donuts anywhere else! My favorite doughnut is the Maple Long John, and my daughter loves the strawberry sprinkled donut with a strawberry milk"}
{"text":"I recently discovered boba smoothies when eating at a Vietnamese restaurant with my boyfriend and his family. I am obsessed! I searched on Yelp for boba tea in my area and Bosa Donuts appeared to be the closest place with a  drive-thru that sold them. The good news is they are open 24/7 so I am able to get my boba smoothie or tea fix whenever I want. I have tried their mango and watermelon and both were really good. My boyfriend has ordered the banana strawberry and the melon so far and he was also pleased with both of the flavors he chose. I also ordered my brother a ham and cheese bagel sandwich and he said it tasted amazing. I have only visited this location twice and late at night and there is a wait time which I don't mind because they take the time to make the drinks/food great quality. This is my new stop for late night munchies."}
{"text":"Service is always hit or miss (today was great), but the donuts are ALWAYS great! Bought a dozen for a class I'm teaching. They all loved it!"}
{"text":"Was in line and next and ignored for a walk in on 5/11 at 2:56pm ... Nice way to treat a new customer to you store. Needless to say I left... Lost business.... Oh well..."}
{"text":"There are some days where you just want a delicious little treat for yourself. When I'm having one of those days I love to come here for a honeydew smoothie or an iced coffee with a glazed or buttermilk doughnut (My absolute favorite). There is no reason to go to a chain like DD or KK for delicious doughnutty goodness when these guys do it better!! I've also had one of their apple fritters that was super delicious too! I have only gone through the drive through but have only had excellent service."}
{"text":"Bosa has some of the best donuts in the valley please come and meet the new restaurant owners and come get a free Donut from May till June"}
{"text":"Went in for a boba and couldn't resist trying a donut. The boba was ok, it seems like they overcooked them a bit but the smoothie itself was good. The glazed donut I tried was excellent. I could easily see going back here just to grab some donuts. The lady working the counter was very nice."}
{"text":"The people here are so friendly! It feels like a small neighborhood bakery. The donuts are so delicious. I prefer the twist donuts or the buttermilk bars, but trust me, they are all good!
Once they let us try the boba because we were asking about it. It's not my thing, but if you like boba you will love theirs. 
They also have hot and iced coffee and bottle drinks. I prefer Bosa donuts to the chain dinuts any day. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Do you like doughnuts?  I said, DO YOU LIKE DOUGHNUTS?! 

If you answered 'yes' to either of these questions, you will enjoy Bosa doughnuts.  We grab a few of these small drops of confectionary heaven often.  My little one's eyes glaze over when I bring a box home (see what I did there?). Arguably, the best doughnuts in Phoenix. 

Their breakfast sandwiches are pretty darn good, as well.

Go and have a doughnut.  Tell 'em a random stranger from the internet sent ya.  ; ^ )"}
{"text":"Came here on a random morning on the weekend. This place is busy! Do not let the hole in the wall exterior, fool you, these guys know donuts. As I parked my car, I was beat out by two other customers, each of which ordered a dozen donuts each! Frankly, I was the only customer not ordering by the dozen, and I say that as a fact, not as an exaggeration.
I ordered a Boston creme, a raspberry filled donut, and a fried chocolate cinnamon donut. The Boston creme tasted good, not heavy like I expected, but more airy instead. I also expected the fried chocolate cinnamon to have a crunch to them like some other donut stores, but this one didn't- I suppose this means it was fried less (not a bad thing) but was still yummy.
My final, delightful surprise was the jalepeno ham and cheese croissant; I ate it so fast I didn't have time to take a picture. I've only ever had a jalepeno ham and cheese croissant back in Newport Beach (California) where I used to live, and I actually like this one is better! There's less bread to cheese and ham ratio, which I like, very much, and since I ate it like a raccoon this can only hint at how addictive this donut hut can be.
Finally, I went back to the counter for a mocha java iced drink to top it all off. I don't think it was that strong, so I wouldn't recommend it.
In summary: order the donuts and the damn delicious jalepeno ham and cheese croissants! The service is super fast, and the owners are so sweet and friendly that they even have a sense of humor when conversing with you. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"The only thing I miss about living in Arcadia. These are 98% of the time fresh (2% of the time not, when you decide to go in the middle of the night), always flavorful, and never expensive."}
{"text":"I walked 6.41 miles today for a Bosa donut, because they're that good.  This morning, I purchased a diverse array of the sweet deep-fried treats to go.  When I arrived home, I portioned each donut into several bite sized segments, so everyone could get a sampling.

The apple fritter was crispy on the outside with a fluffy interior.  Probably the best I've had.  The bear-claw was off the chain, with an apple filling.  The cinnamon rolls were large, and were pretty good, but the tractor wheel ones were unbelievable.

After completing my tasting course, I estimated the consumed calories to be approx 800, so I set off of a journey to burn it off.  A 6.41 mile jog/walk took care of my little indiscretion, plus a a smidge more.  I don't get sweet treats often, and Bosa was well worth it."}
{"text":"Donuts are excellent.  I love that they are open 24 hours because I normally go late at night.  Problem is when I go, which is sometimes midnight or later, they are typically out of most of their donuts.  Also, the service is terrible."}
{"text":"Our favorite donut shop, hands down. We love that they also accommodate our special request orders when we call ahead the day before when we need a large order (like a few dozen of their crispy fritters or delicious buttermilk bars, etc.). Open 24 hours. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Their ice coffees are my go to here!

I get it flavored with caramel and half and half. Fast, affordable and easy!!

Of course, there are lots of different donuts to choose from as well."}
{"text":"Best donuts in the land. And they are reasonably priced, too. I like that they are open late -- donuts are not just for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Came here at 5am for a quick breakfast and was curious if they had any sandwiches or croissants, which they don't. But it was fine, the donuts were fine. 

One of their posters was confusing and looked like they had flavors of smoothie, and separate flavors of boba. Different flavor jelly boba are common so I asked for a coconut smoothie with mango boba. That's when my experience here took a huge hit. The lady didn't understand what I meant and barked at me that she only sells one flavor boba- plain.

She was definitely not a happy person before I ordered but she had me miserable by the time I was done. She made the tea quickly, but  I received about 1/2 a cup full of smoothie and 1/2 a cup of whipped cream. 

Too many similar places to deal with this one. Spare yourself and go to the location a couple blocks over"}
{"text":"Best donuts I have found in Phoenix, hands down. The staff is always super polite and the selection is always good, even during busy times or at night they never seem to be out of anything."}
{"text":"The best place for fresh and very soft donuts. The Tai Tea was also amazing and the boba was perfect not soggy like some places. If you've never been you need to go!"}
{"text":"Once every five to ten years I have a doughnut. Not because I don't love them, because I do. I just know it could become a staple and I'm not that disciplined. Anyway, when I do have my donut, it must be Bosa. I hate going into Bosa because the line is long and kids are always in that line screaming and pointing with load taps on the donut case. But, the fancy donuts... the cinnamon roll is just the right amount of yeast and cinnamon flavor. Nice ratio of glaze to donut too. Soft and delicious. The apple fritter is just how I like it too. Firm and blocked throughout, heavy but not soaked in grease. The Bosa folks really know how to make donuts. I would drive for miles when they had one location. My how they have grown."}
{"text":"Love the apple fritters and jalapeno croissants! We got 2 sandwiches and half a dozen donuts (boston creme/long johns/sprinkles) for ~$11. Go early on Sundays to beat the long lines.

This is our go to pastry place!"}
{"text":"Recently opened one by my house and u wish they hadn't!! These ate the most delicious donuts I have ever tasted!!  I want to eat them everyday!!  Friendly staff, good prices, and soooo very addicting!"}
{"text":"Best donuts in town and the sweet girls behind the counter make this place even better."}
{"text":"Donuts are really good here and at a great price! The store itself is dirty every time I come here. Look at the light fixtures, walls, air vents and see the thick layer of dust piling up. It's gross for a place selling food. I even clean my own table that I sit at because they are all dirty."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious donuts available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week? Going to BoSa is like having died and gone  to donut heaven.

I can't comment on the ice cream they also apparently sell, but you really can't go wrong with any of their donuts. They're generously sized, super-tasty, and the only aftertaste is of baked and/or fried goods made with love.

If you're in Chandler, BoSa's pretty much conveniently located in the middle of the city. If you're outside of Chandler, it's well worth the drive (or if you're crazy like Brett B., the walk).

Grocery store donuts will suffice when I can barely drag myself out of bed, but when I want the good stuff, I go to BoSa."}
{"text":"This place is great.  My wife and I went here around 1120 pm looking for some sweets and this place sure got the job done.  They're glazed donuts tasted comparable that of Krispy Kreme.  Another plus was that I got a dozen assorted for only $6 bucks how about that? including my fav. Apple Fritter."}
{"text":"This place makes some good donuts, I'm talking better then DD donuts or any other donut I've tried.. no joke. So why the 4 star review? Well to some this might be nothing but after watching a video on Arizona Ice Tea I'm sure some if not all of you know a can of Arizona Ice Tea is 99 cents, I mean it says it on the can. It's funny because the video said if a vender charges you more than 99 cents you should speak up, they don't put it on the can for nothing. I can tell you as a New Yorker I never spent more than 99 cents on an Arizona Ice Tea in New York but Bosa's charged me $1.49! Again lol to some this is nothing and it really is nothing it's just something I noticed and I wrote this in hope they see this and possibly make the change."}
{"text":"The line was a bit long today for Labor Day weekend, but the donuts are too good to not crowd here. They are super friendly service and even where there is only one person working she never seems stressed. The donuts are always in stock and they always have my favorite. A dozen is 9.74 and that is super reasonable for the quality."}
{"text":"Fresh donuts all day long. Love to stop by and take some for me and my co-workers. We have a different and more enjoyable day. Great service, fast."}
{"text":"We have in the past been told that certain donuts were vegan and certain ones were not. This has been said at multiple locations. Today we were told that none of the donuts are vegan and that they all contain milk. The practice of giving vegans false information to make sales is gross. (At one point I was told they were vegan by an owner at the Indian school location) for those of us who don't want to eat animals or stuff that comes out of them, this is just disgusting."}
{"text":"We have previously been told several times that several of the donuts are vegan. One of the owners told us this years ago and we have been told this several times over the years. When we go in we would ask which ones were vegan and choose those. Today we were told that none are vegan and that they all contain milk (at an east valley location)."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is so weird.  It looks like a converted Wendy's or something, but the donuts are fresh and delicious.  There's SO many options and they are substantial.  Prices are a bit high, and there thai iced tea had very slimy boba the day that I visited, but I would give them another shot just for their donuts.  After all, that is their specialty, right?"}
{"text":"Great new BoSa Donuts location. Situated on 32nd Street just north of Shea, it's perfect for anyone about to hop on the 51.

Opened August 14, 2015, this BoSa is housed in what was once a Wendy's. It has the familiar BoSa menu and a roomy dining room complete with sofas. Also a drive thru in case getting out of your car for your donut fix is too much exercise.

Open daily 4:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. 

A great addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Ok. I can't help but skip to the sub par reviews here to see what these people could possibly complain about. Haha- I love this: \"I've heard good things about this place from my sister's friends (notice, I didn't say \"my\" friends).\" Because Glob forbid sharing friends with your siblings right?!? OMG, what a snob! This person's review had me ready to head over to Scottsdale Fashion Square with a rifle. Haha, not really, but I have been listening to Malcolm X speeches all morning, so those have me a little amped. Maybe squirt guns filled with hydrogenated oil. Go to Bosa's. Get a donut. Love it. Then do some jumping jacks. I have been here many times, and have not had a bad experience. The girl who assembled my Office Ass Kissing Platter this morning was extremely polite. The donuts were tits.. as always-"}
{"text":"without a doubt bosa donuts are the best anywhere in arizona...i did not know this location opened up...but i do now! yipppeee!

you have to try this location...friendly staff that works very hard to keep you happy. welcome to glendale! see you again for father's day."}
{"text":"without doubt the best donuts in the valley...my favorite is the classic glazed old fashioned...2nd is the apple fritter. At least I am getting some fruit for breakfast eh?"}
{"text":"I can't even. So amazing. The best glazed donuts of all time."}
{"text":"Really great, fresh donuts! I am a donut snob, so this 5 star review shouldn't be taken lightly. I have had only excellent experiences at this Bosa location! Every donut I have tried has been delicious--especially the maple bar and the buttermilk bar. Pro tip: always ask for what is freshest and you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"The only thing that I hate about this place is that it is in walking distance! The service is always fast and friendly. I frequent here for their croissant breakfast sandwich. My favorite donut is the buttermilk and I always get a French vanilla coffee to wash it down."}
{"text":"The food quality was okay.... until i seen a few pest.
An annoying fly.. black ants on the floor and one on the donut display...a grasshopper on the table, and last but not least one of the workers casually sitting by the drive thru window shoes off feet kicked up and picking in her toes."}
{"text":"Donuts like they should be. My kids and I really like the strawberry frosted donuts but they're all good. Too good. I'm glad they're far from me so I can't go often, lol."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. I liked it both times but the last time the donuts were better than the 1st. I'd give it 5 stars if the donuts are always as yummy as the last time. Yes, they are very bad for you but they are very yummy!! Way better than Dunkin and about the same as Krispy Kreme for the glaze. If I were only getting glaze I would go with Krispy because they're lighter but Bosa has so many other yummy flavors that Krispy can't compete with. I drive 45 min to get to it but thankfully it's a few miles from my favorite park :)"}
{"text":"Fresh amazing donuts. 24hr drive through, They have have  traditional section of donuts and pastries that are very good."}
{"text":"I don't like donuts, however Bosa takes the lowly donut and makes it a pastry

The only donuts worth the calories

The Crumb and Raspberry filled are excellent

The ham and cheese crossaint is pretty solid, works nicely if you have some extra lunch meat at home you can heat up and eat alongside it, as for a couple bucks you are not going to get a ton of meat in the pastry, boars head pastrami works nicely"}
{"text":"I generally wont eat donut's not worth the calories, however their donuts are simply amazing

light airy with a nice crispyness to the outside - simply amazing

i recommend the coconut glazed with the crispys on the top (looks kind of like the gem hostess donuts) 

worth every calorie"}
{"text":"At first, I thought Bosa had only in a couple locations in the valley, but after we moved to Central PHX, I've realized that Bosa has become a DYNASTY.

I have always had a passion about donuts. Even when I was at my peak health, there was room for donuts.

Bosa just does it right, the Cinnamon Crumb is clearly the best donut, but even the cake donuts rock. (Please dont' make me regret recommending this flavor, leave one for me from time to time, friends)

Coffee is usually quality, and black as night. The Dunkin's in the area seem to have a real problem with consistency, but not the case w/ Bosa

I too look forward to trying their take on Boba Tea, but it's gonna be hard to beat The Street.

Take it from a guy who could put away a dozen donuts, but has the will to eat just one at a sitting... Why waste your calories on crappy cakes, candies, etc, Donuts are the way to go."}
{"text":"Oh crap. There's a Bosa Donuts near my home. Bother! Used to be I had to go way out of my way to get these amazing donuts. Sigh, now I have to fight will power. I'm weak. I love their iced cake donuts. Darn them!

So I've read through a lot of the other reviews before writing my own. It seems this location gets knocked for having less than perfect service. I can't find a review that knocks their donut quality.

Folks: it's a donut shop! No place for rude service, I'll agree. But, it's not a sit down, dine-in restaurant with table service. It's a donut shop. You go in, you get tempted by the display. You pick way too many out. You get them and you leave. Right? Sure there are some \"chain\" donut shops that likely have impeccable decor and robotic service but their donuts suck.

Maybe I just have lower expectations than some. The only other donut shop I've ever really loved for great donuts is near a beach in Orange County. It's not uncommon for the beach to make its way onto the floor of this shop. And, there are some \"salty\" regulars who fill up the dining area for hours some days. Or, so it seems.

Bosa Donuts has amazing donuts. That's the truth."}
{"text":"Due to a heavy footed neighbor upstairs in our hotel, I was up and about around 6am.  I knew I needed some coffee and donuts.  Dunkin Donuts is right near my hotel so I went and got a cup of coffee there.  Then headed here to get some donuts.  The Yelpers of Scottsdale did me right.  These donuts were very good....not Marys donuts good (Marys holds a special place in my heart and will always be my favorite), but maybe 2nd place ;-).    Still a 5 star joint! Placed my order for a chocolate covered buttermilk bar, a glazed raised, a chocolate raised and a crumb raised.  Total was $3.70 for 4 donuts.  Not shabby at all.  Here is how the donuts stacked up.

Chocolate Buttermilk Bar-  DAMN!  This was one of the best donuts I can ever remember eating!  This thing was crisp on the outside for a little crunch, dense on the inside (almost like a pound cake) for a good \"cake like\" chew and had a ton of chocolate on it.  During the bites you could pick out the distinct buttermilk flavor.  This thing was awesome and I'm definitely coming back before I leave to get more of these.  They also had them in maple frosting and something else too.  Delicious!

Glazed-  Not too shabby.  Very light and airy and not too sweet.  Definitely a good donut and I would get it again.

Crumb- Pretty tasty also.  Good crumb topping and light and airy like the glazed.

Chocolate Raised- My wife ate that one and I didn't try it.  She liked it though and that's good enough for me.  If it was as good as the other 3 donuts, I'm sure it was great.

The lady at the counter was nice as can be and they even have a drive through!  If I lived in the area, this would definitely be my go to donut spot.  Bravo for the recommendations Scottsdale Yelpers....Bravo!"}
{"text":"Picked up some donuts for my buddy.  I have been to other Bosa donuts before and they were awesome.  Came to this one since it was the closest location to where I was.  I got a half dozen.  The only bummer was that they did not have my favorite kind....buttermilk bars!   Fresh out.  Whack!  Their donuts are delicious though and warrant 4 stars on their own.  If you have a chance to try the buttermilk bars, get them immediately.  Possibly the best donut in the land.  If I am ever in the area, and craving donuts, Bosa is usually always the right choice!"}
{"text":"Talk is cheap! Everyone has their favs...but actions! Wrap your tongue around one of these sweet delights, and I promise you will smile! 

I rarely eat donuts, but after everyone kept bragging this place...you know I gotta try it!  

Now I feel blessed, there's one less than a mile from my house!"}

I was drivin' by when it caught my eye
Standin' by itself lookin' sweet and shy
I turned in to the lot, swaying' to and fro
And soon I knew I'd never let them go

Blame it on the Bosa Donut with its tasty treats
Blame it on the Bosa Donut that I love to eat
Oh, it all began with a maple bar
Now it seems I can't fit in my car
Blame it on the Bosa Donut
The food of love

Now was it the pie?
No, no, the Bosa Donuts
Or the stir fry?
No, no, the Bosa Donuts
Now was it the glazed?
Yeah, yeah, the Bosa Donuts
The treats of love

Now I'm glad to say I'm in control
And I stop at just one jelly roll
And when I try to grab a dozen
My shock collar starts a buzzin'

Blame it on the Bosa Donuts with its cake and glazed
Blame it on the Bosa Donuts that I'm lightly tased
Oh, it all began with Bavarian Creme
Now I know I can't fit in my jeans
Blame it on the Bosa Donut
The fritters of love!"}
{"text":"AMAZING.  I was turned on to Bosa by a co worker an I have never looked back.  Located in what use to be fast food place Bosa ROCKS.  They remind me of the place I use to go to as a kid.  Perfect fluff and crispy-ness.  I highly recommend Bosa to anyone.  The only problem is that it is going to equal extra time at the gym, because I have yet to eat just one when I get them.  Which one is your favorite???????? :)"}
{"text":"This new Bosa is very spacious!  The service was good and the donuts are always delicious. Now they just need a drive through. ;-)"}
{"text":"Bosa is reliable.  Never had a problem.  Clean store, good customer service.  Fresh donuts.  Excellent place!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the doughnuts but I have to say the girl that usually works the drive through at the Arcadia location can be really unfriendly for no reason....  Everyone else that works there is great but I think she needs a vacation..."}
{"text":"Need donuts?  This is the only place you should go. While I have kept my selection limited to glazed donuts,  donut holes,  apple fritters, french crullers  and buttermilk bars, statistcly speaking if everything else is just as good you are in good hands.  Don't take it from me just look at the numerous reviews that say it's good."}
{"text":"Delicious Donuts! Great service. My new neighborhood donut shop. I'll be back for the #1 combo - two donuts & a coffee. Perfect."}
{"text":"So good. The donuts are always fresh and delicious. I prefer the dozen chocolate donut holes when I go because they are so moist, chocolaty, and just the right amount of sweet. The most recent time I went I also got a ham and cheese croissant and it was so good that I am debating going back for just that."}
{"text":"If I'm about to splurge and buy some donuts, I go to Bosa. They are quick and have a wide selection of delectable donuts. I really love their old fashioned donuts with maple glaze. I usually order a half dozen with my boyfriend, we'd order more but between the two of us but we don't for obvious reasons. 

They also have these super yummy ham, cheese, and jalapeno filled croissants. An instant hangover or empty stomach cure. 

There's not a whole lot to say other than the fact that they are inexpensive, quick, and delicious!"}
{"text":"The donuts here are amazing, but the inside of the store is pretty dirty. They had some bugs inside which was pretty gross, but again donuts are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"All my life I never thought a donut shop would be better than Krispy Kreme's  Boy was I wrong and underestimated this place. The donuts are delightful and to make it even better, their open 24 hours a day!!! The staff was very nice and gave me a sample of some of their smoothie drinks (which were heavenly). I will definitely be visiting again shortly and I will recommend this donut shop to anyone I come across! A++++ for me!"}
{"text":"They have really awesome donut holes! Service is fast and they have a friendly staff."}
{"text":"One of the best donuts I've ever tried. I always get a dozen, but it comes +12 pieces every time."}
{"text":"Bosa Donuts seriously has the best donuts ever. Their texture is light, fluffy, airy, yet chewy, and makes for very enjoyable donuts. The regular glazed donut is my favorite.....just simple and sweet, like how life should be."}
{"text":"I love Bosa donuts, I have been coming here for years and it has definitely left its small mark as a local business with unique delicious donuts and fast quick breakfast. But as all businesses know the staff they hire to obtain their brand must have an ethical background for customer service. Although the building isn't up to date and it is not that aesthetically pleasing, the customer service has taking a nose dive. This morning I woke up ready for my bagel and cream cheese and iced coffee, I had my other two friends with me in vehicle as we ordered through the drive through. The woman taking our order \"Danny\" would continuously talk over our orders and didn't give us a chance to repeat them thoroughly back. Given they didn't look too busy, we pull up to the window and asked if they got our orders correctly, \"Danny\" followed by talking back to me \"You never ordered that!\" With an aggressive abysmal tone. I am in no way a nagging yelper, but Danny deserved to be called out for her ill mannered behavior toward a paying customer! I will continue to come back because the food hasn't put a bad taste in my mouth just yet. I just would love if \"Danny\" in the highlighted green shirt would have a little more respect."}
{"text":"When I get donuts for he office.. This place is definitely my go to. Everyone at the office loves the succulent, fluffy, soft, warm, and tasty donuts from here. I even get certain requests from team members on the type of donut flavor they would like. I highly recommend the glazed and chocolate sprinkled donuts. They are my top two favorites.
My hubs did order their breakfast croissant sandwiches a few times and loved every bite!"}
{"text":"Simply THE BEST!

Do you want your coworkers to give you happy high fives... Well this is the place to go in order to out smiles on their faces. I often pick up a few dozen for my employees birthdays. Let me tell you they are a huge hit! Even the CEO and CFO of the company come by just to grab a warm, gooey, delectable donut once they see me carry in the white boxes in. Their original glazed donuts are everyone's absolute favorite. 

This place has become my entire departments favorite donut shop. Go, run, dash there and grab some to go!"}
{"text":"THE best donut shop in town! Such great people! I've been to all 50 states, 87 countries, and all 7 continents and this is one of the best donut shops I've ever been to!"}
{"text":"There is a place called Heaven, and it is a Bosa glazed donut.  The donut holes are the best and a real deal at 12 for $0.99.  It's not a quick stop though, Arcadia loves them some Bosa so there is always a line in the drive through.  But the wait in line for a fluffy pillow that is a Bosa donut is soooooo worth it."}
{"text":"I love Bosa !!! I  was so excited when one came not to far from my moms house when she watches my kids I make a trip there, I especially love their lunch sandwiches inexpensive and fresh quality perfect amount of food and of coarse pick up some tasty little doughnut holes for a treat later in the day. They offer a loyalty card inside when you go in you can grab one from the counter it's a 15% off your entire purchase !!!! I thought that it was just a coupon but to my surprise it's something you can keep and show them every time score !!! There doughnuts always taste fresh and delicious way better than any chain plus I like to help support smaller local businesses . Stop by and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"There is never a time when eating a donut is not an appropriate decision, and Bosa makes that decision taste even sweeter. It's usually pretty quiet inside so I like to sit and have a Thai iced tea with boba while I get work done. (That's right, they have SO much more than just donuts.)

Their prices are pretty low but the donuts are high quality. I love the cake donuts myself, but they have a lot of options for any type of donut fanatic. 

The staff is friendly and helpful and every experience I've had here has been positive!"}
{"text":"Always great donuts! Our sons favorite place to go! Nice staff. Tons of choices and very clean! We come alot and have never had an issue. Thank you guys for great donuts and service!"}
{"text":"Best donuts in town no joke. These are the best donuts around way better then dunkins dry hard cold donuts"}
{"text":"Open 24 hours a day, how convenient is that! 
I absolutely love their apple fritters, I'm addicted to them. Heated up they are amaaaaaazing!
They're even more addicting because I get a free donut out of every New Times that comes out on Tuesdays. 
I wouldn't necessarily look at this place as a comfortable coffee shop vibe, it's more of a grab and go kind of place.
Honestly I don't think I've ever seen other people there, but their donuts are cheap and delicious."}
{"text":"First time customer for me. I love the apple fritter, it's the only one made by a chain here in the Phoenix area that actually has Apple in it .....yea!"}
{"text":"Donuts are always fresh and delicious and great prices. I usually go through the drive thru which is quick and easy."}
{"text":"Step over Krispy Kreme! Bosa has the best donuts I have ever eaten!
You have to try the creme filled ones too!! A customer brought some in for my employees and I have been thinking of them ever since! My employees have too. Found the address and am driving across town  to get some more.
They must use all the ingredients of the old days to taste this good."}
{"text":"As I have now been out of the state of Arizona for over 90 days--clean and sober from Bosa I feel I can update their star rating.  I've been spending time in a pastry recovery program and even though I relapse daily, I'm confident there is hope. 
#1DayAtATime.  Perhaps when I fully recover and am able to drive past Bosa without binging through dozens of donut holes, I'll restore their 5th star!"}
{"text":"Best donuts and yummy ice thai tea boba drink!
We always go to this donut shop frequently because its so good. The people who work here are friendly and they always have bunch of fresh donuts."}
{"text":"So I keep hearing that Bosa donuts are amazing so as a donut lover I had to try it. I used to eat an entire box of crispy creme when it first came out... its weird I just love donuts more than any other sweets out there and I try very hard not to eat them regularly since I can't stop once I start haha. Ok so on my way home, I stopped by and grabbed a few. They had a good selection considering it was 6pm on a Tuesday. I started off w the mini donut holes and I asked for 4 and the girl seemed surprised that I only wanted 4 and asked \"thats all?\" Poor girl has no clue I have no self control when it comes to donuts! Then I got the toasted coconut and rainbow sprinkles. She was right, I should have ordered more of the mini donut holes!! They were so fluffy with the perfect amount of texture and sweetness. Then I literally just took a bite of the rainbow sprinkles and the coconut since I want to save these for tomorrow morning!! Absolutely delicious!! Did I mention for everything I paid under $2.70??? So 4 stars for being delicious and inexpensive!!! I only docked a point cuz they didn't have my maple syrup glazed eclairs..."}
{"text":"I think the only thing positive out our trip this morning was they actually had a full donuts case at 10:30am when we got there. 

Other than that, MEH. Service was awful. We were not greeted, we sat at the counter waiting for them to finish their conversation. Tried asking some questions to have one lady give us the quickest and easiest answer that we do not feel was actually true, while the other employee seemed like she was going to disagree with her but maybe it was her manager so she just shut up. It was very confusing and we couldn't even just get a straight answer, even after saying \"oh, I wasn't paying attention\" when I called her out on her obvious lie. 

We pointed out which donuts we would like clearly and using their names and she still gave us one of the wrong ones. 

And then you pay and their system has the nerve to ask you to leave a tip. Efffff that. 

The place is dirty. Try looking up, the vents and lights are covered in dust that either is about to or already is...falling into your food. I don't even want to look behind the counter. 

We needed to use the restroom but hell no. 

I know this place is an institution for many locals, but I think it's gone to their heads."}
{"text":"Great donuts ... Better than Dunkin (and I love theirs). I justbhad the classics ... jelly & glazed but both were great. Whatever you do, don't look at the floor. I don't think I've ever seen a dirtier floor in a food related business in my life!"}
{"text":"Ok, first off,, I'm giving them one more star because the employees were really cool and I am sure this isn't their fault either. So in saying that, let me just say \"What the $&@% was that I tasted, it sure wasn't no $&@%£¥ donut!!!\" Now maybe some people like that flavor or whatever that was I was tasting in that thing, but my god that was horrid! And what was strange was it was only in the regular donuts because the jelly filled ones tasted just fine. Look, I am sorry because I hate giving bad reviews but I also have to be honest too, so, yeah, well,, that's pretty much all I got to say I guess..  Maybe it was that I was there at the wrong time that they actually had a bad batch and they came out tasting like that, but I am not going back to chance that happening again. So it looks like I'll have to drive a couple more miles further once again if we want some donuts here. That really sucks too because when I seen that a donut place opened up like right across the street from me I got a little bit excited, real let down that was though. Oh well...

***Well, I was looking through here just now to find the next closest donut shop because these donuts tasted horrid. What do I see? Almost everyone else has five full stars for this place! What? I just find it hard to believe that anyone would like that taste, I mean we through out donuts!  DONUTS!!!  So now I'm leaning more towards maybe it was a bad batch or something that day, because how can there be that many stars..  might have to go there one more time and then update this accordingly. You people better not let me down here! Counting on you!******"}
{"text":"Delicious treats at an amazing price. This is not a combination that is found often. I had heard so many people rave about these donuts and when I finally tried them I confirmed they were not lying. My favorite is the apple fritter. The standard glazed comes in a close second. They are open until 10pm and their drive thru is open 24 hours. Great for a late night sweet craving. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"WHAT EVERYONE needs to know about this spot is that if you tip on your card, it's going to the owner not the employees. If you tip cash, then the employee will actually get it. Very unethical to rob employees like that. Maybe this is why the customer service is typically bad."}
{"text":"I have never had a better doughnut. They are like a drug you just gotta keep going back for more!"}
{"text":"Just tried it for the first time and it's hands down my new favorite donut place. The donuts remind me of New York City donuts which I miss very much! I paired my donut with a green tea smoothie and it's nice, not overpowering like most are."}
{"text":"best donuts in town, friendly service, and  clean place! try the all chocolate donuts and the cinammon ones they are delicious! i will definitely come back! if I could I would give them 6 stars!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place they have great breakfast item, amazing donuts, and delicious drinks but it seen to me every time I come to boss donuts there aren't enough employees and it also wouldn't hurt to smile. Simple things like this is what I think about before going out. yes everything taste great but if I can't get the great customer service I need I would rather but a doughnut from Starbucks or circle k as I travel to get to bosa I pass three Starbucks hopefully things are butter if I come back . Well shall see."}
{"text":"I love Bosa in general. However, this Bosa has some odd tasting glazes. The chocolate is just...weird. 
BUT.  4 donuts and 2 dozen donuts holes through the drive through for nearly $8 seems high, and then?
They added a 27 percent TIP into my bill without my permission. 
NEVER AGAIN. 
THAT'S THEFT."}
{"text":"How could I possibly have forgotten to review Bosa Donuts? What the heck is wrong with me?

Bosa can't do anything wrong.

Well, almost.  :)

We love the Thai iced tea with Boba (okay, sometimes the boba is a teeny bit chewier than strictly perfect)

We love the bagel sandwiches.

I'm freaking addicted to the donut holes.  Light little darlings of deliciousness!

The jelly filled are better than sex.  Well, okay, maybe not.  But close.  Veeerrrryy close.

The buttermilk ones are fantastic for a big sweet tooth.  They also have great heft and texture.

So you really need me to go on?

One teeny criticism.  I'm not crazy about the flavor of the chocolate covering they use on their boston cream donuts. 

Try something there.  Anything.  You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"The donuts here were fresh, the boba was your typical sweet powdered stuff but it hit the spot. It's like 2 mins from my parents house so I'll most likely be back 


Update: been here about 5x since in the last 10 days. 3 out of those times the boba in my drink has been way undercooked, super hard. 

Donuts are still good, the powdery drinks are ok but I'll skip the boba from now on. Trying to keep all my teeth in place"}
{"text":"Came here on the recommendation of our neighbor and it did not disappoint! Very busy location but service was quick with lots of help behind the counter. We ordered glazed donuts, twisty glaze and maple bars. Donuts were light and fluffy. My girls also got 2 chocolate milks and the total came out to a little over $8. We found our new donut spot!!"}
{"text":"The donut holes, old fashioned donuts and fritters are amazing. Coffee is delicious too! So much better than any of the competitors. I am not even a big donut person but every now and then when it is time for donuts, this is where I go!"}
{"text":"Very good donuts. Came here on a random morning because I felt like eating some donuts and wasn't disappointed. They had a wide assortments of donuts and all of them were very good. Would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We do love our Ahwatukee Bosa, they usually have a good selection of donuts, even late at night.  We have always enjoyed a good custard filled donut, their Boston creme is up there on top the list for classic custard filled style.  They also introduced us to the chocolate covered old fashion, forget cake donuts, go this route, it has that crisp edge all over which is awesome when deep fried.

They are also super easy to work with I'd you need a bunch of donuts for an event.  I just stopped by the night before, ordered 8 dozen and picked them up in the morning.  Easy, efficient and tastey.

Add, they get pushed up to 5 star on availability.  We have never found them closed when we just wanted to stop in for a donut.  Get out of a movie at midnight and need a sweet treat, Bosa might still be open!"}
{"text":"Awesome. All of em. Try your fav then venture out you won't be disappointed.

Rasp Jelly + Butter milk for me."}
{"text":"Yeaaaa, I've had their donuts but this time it wasn't what I was expecting.

Have you ever bit into something that and you expect one thing and get something else. Well thats how I felt. I was like --- I've bosas and THEY. ARE. GOOD.   - Not this chocolate sprinkle cake donut. Expecting soft and getting rough and dry - so this location i didn't feel ya.

I will be aware that not all bosas are made the same -_-"}
{"text":"You can not eat JUST ONE! I know a doughnut hater (yes, they exist) that I took there and they ate 4 doughnuts! They are the most moist, soft, delicious things in the world. They are cheaper than anywhere else and sooo good. Just try to make it home with an intact dozen!"}
{"text":"Great donuts. The best donuts I've found in Arizona so far. Moist, light, fluffy--all at once. Get ready to smell this place from across the street. So yummy!"}
{"text":"I was really in the mood for some donuts so came here and its so good.I actually tried a lot of the dounts and there great made fresh every morning I highly recomend this place.there frozen cappuccino is really good .this place has a nice energy aswell"}
{"text":"I love boss.  I'm from San Diego  and old school at that.  But if you ever had s Winchell  donut;  they are wonderful.  Bosas donuts taste very similar to Winchell's.  If you go really early  the donuts are warm.  Yummy good.   With all the other donut places around now,  boss is my favorite"}
{"text":"Horrible place. They don't turn ac on in the summer, sometimes it's 100+ outside and inside feels so hot and humid so I wonder how are the donuts survive. Worst customer service. It's a joke that the owner hired those people. No customer service training whatsoever.  Find other place that at least willing to turn their air conditioning so you know the donuts won't be bad in a short period of time and people who knows how to work in customer facing environment."}
{"text":"These guys make the best Apple Fritter, and what is so totally awesome about this drive through donut shop, is that it's a drive through donut shop with a great apple fritter. Did I mention the Apple Fritter is to die for?

How about to DRIVE THROUGH...I'm there!

Not too big, plenty of sweet apple, and a slight crunch, with a delicate, not too sweet of a glaze that gives that \"just right\" after taste...perfection."}
{"text":"These are the best donuts I have ever tasted. I only wish I had discovered them sooner, and I wish the lady in the drive-thru didn't always yell at me... but other than that I have no complaints. The raspberry filled, buttermilk bar, and bear claw thingie are my fave"}
{"text":"I LOVE Bosa! And to be honest, I prefer them over Dunkin Donuts! Friendly staff and delliiicciooousss donuts and cheap too! :) Their breakfast food items are really good too!!! I recommend this place for donuts over Dunkin any day if the week!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the Dunkin Donuts nearby but saw the flashing open sign and decided to try something different. The space was clean and the staff friendly. The donuts were light and fluffy. The combo with 2 donuts and coffee was less than at Dunkin. So I now have a new place for my Sunday morning coffee and donuts."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Got a cake donut. I like the hours. Cheap prices. Only thing I would say is later at night, they run out of more stuff. Otherwise, good experience."}
{"text":"Really good donuts and super friendly staff.  Decent coffee too.  I recommend grabbing a dozen+ donut holes to bring into your coworkers when you stop in here.  A dozen holes is only 99 cents.  Then, sit back and watch them all flock in and stuff their faces like crazy, starving animals.  :-)"}
{"text":"Love this place I will drive the extra 4 miles to get it at least twice a week!! Their cherry sprinkles, bear claw and long johns are mmmm mmmm good!!!!"}
{"text":"These are my favorite donuts in Phoenix, which is not saying much bc I think all donuts in Phoenix are pretty bad (compared to the ones you could get back home).  But if you are craving a sugary treat, this is a great place to stop by and grab a dozen for the road!  I always get the Boston cremes, yum.

This location isn't as great as the other Bosa locations bc there is no drive thru!!  But there is ample parking in their lot so that's okay...."}
{"text":"I love visiting this place because the donuts are good. A special mention to the lady who can multitask like crazy, take orders, make the shakes, pack donuts, etc. I have never seen anyone so prompt at providing a good service with a smile on the face."}
{"text":"Missing my donut spots in Cincinnati (513 what!) I had to see if Bosa could do the job.
Mission complete! Such good donuts! Love em! Friendly staff, a wide variety of drinks and other products and usually have some good coupons. A little pricey but not too bad."}
{"text":"These doughnuts are the best! This location is also awesome. Polite and professional folks here."}
{"text":"These are absolutely the best. I've gone to even different locations and they are still the best!  This is my \"go-to\" for donuts for sure!"}
{"text":"I was ordering a few donuts , and made a  Uhmmmmm sound while making a decision on my next Donut and I hear one of 3 girls behind the counter imitate my Uhmmmmm sound and were giggling and chatting even as I was paying. I will never go back to Bosa Donuts. They need to have there employees respect customers , not make fun of them in an other language.
I was very insulted being a citizen of this country , why do I have to go out of my way to figure out their culture etc. They should be speaking in ENGLISH , not Thai or what language it was , it is very RUDE."}
{"text":"I want to grow my own food but I can't find any doughnut seeds.

Yay! Another Bosa location! I believe this is the eleventh in their growing business. Fresh doughnuts, flavorful smoothies, bubble tea, burgers, sandwiches, and more! They have combo deals and mocha-choca-lata-ya-ya! What can be said that hasn't been said elsewhere? Come get your breakfast eats!  Mr. Dubs seems to be quite a fan so I foresee some random excursions to Bosa now that they've opened a location so close to home.

Bosa sits in the SW corner of Elliot & Dobson where the old Tru West was located. They have a great promo going on for their grand opening: Free doughnut or coffee from April 10th until the 16th! Give this family-owned business a try!"}
{"text":"Great place for drunken 2 AM donuts after a giant party.  Your fellow patrons who also happen to be here at 2 AM make for some great people-watching.  I'm sure it goes both ways.  This place reminds me of the 24-7 Denny's in my hometown where highschoolers would go hang out since nothing else is open that late.

I don't remember too much about the end of graduation, but I do remember that these apple fritters were excellent.  Also, our DD drove us here since he wanted donuts, so apparently they taste great sober too."}
{"text":"Bosa doughnuts! It's the kind of place where you have one and will definitely haunt your craving nightmares. 'It's 2am and you want a glazed doughnut' that's your brain. Glazed doughnuts I think are the tell of good place. If they can't do a glazed doughnut right then what the hell are you doing at that doughnut place, get yourself to bosa!! They are fluffy but not full of air, and just a delicious success. I'm also a fan of the smaller and more sense cake doughnuts. They have plenty of drinks and coffee and other things, but honestly I've never had anything but doughnuts here.

Be prepared when ordering to hear the dreadful 'we are out' they do run out of different doughnuts intermittently. Don't freak out at them, just try another doughnut!

If I ever move I think this is the place I'll miss."}
{"text":"I cannot with words do these donuts justice. They are everything you would want in the perfect donut- the perfect combination of fluffy and light, yet gloriously chewy as soon as you take a bite. For years, I mistook the pink frosted donuts for strawberry- the best strawberry frosting I had ever eaten. While ordering one time, the worker corrected me, \"You mean cherry frosted?\" Cherry frosting, of course! It's delectable. These remain my all time fave, but the crumb are a close second. It's a blessing that this location is far from my house, otherwise  I would undoubtedly be there every week."}
{"text":"I stopped by their grand opening late morning today for the Free Doughnut (or Donut) Day today.
The blonde gal working the counter almost looked like she didn't know it was free donut day- even while they were having their own grand opening freebie at their location.  I inquired which donuts were free, because I knew that not all the donuts were free.  Sadly awkward.  However, she was polite and pointed out the donuts on display on the bottom shelves.  I selected vanilla filling.  I would've appreciated it if there were markers in front of each tray to distinguish the donuts and fillings.
The donut I had was very fresh and the vanilla filling was tasty and not too sweet.
They also had misters on above their patio.
Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"These are the best donuts ever! So big and moist. I can't eat any other kind of donut now. They have 12 donut holes for $1! Crazy!"}
{"text":"My Favorite Donuts!!! Yummy!!! I Can't Be Strong Here!!!

I simply love these donuts! I don't buy donuts anywhere else. I LOVE the maple glazed donuts and the french crullers. I recently even had the maple bar with bacon on it!!! Talk about absolute decadence...

I tend to end up here during the pre-dawn hours at the drive-thru window. I get a maple glazed donut, a french cruller, and a large coffee with cream (which they put in for you). The donuts literally melt in my mouth with almost a crunch when I bite into them, and a slightly grainy sugary fried taste and texture which is perfect followed by a sip of hot coffee. 

Going to the drive-thru I can simply buy two donuts. If I go into the store, I end up so tempted by the display and the aroma that I end up with six donuts... I simply can't be strong here."}
{"text":"I went to a Bosa in Chandler and ordered an iced-t. I live in scottsdale so when I realized that they made me an iced t with coffee in it (total mistake, done it myself) I was driving by the McDowell store and thought I'd ask them to trade my awful drink for a regular tea. The lady explained to me that they were franchise and had nothing to do with that store. So....I explained to her that a medium iced t just cost her and every other Bosa donut,  a customer. I understand that they are owned separately but for reals, an iced t? Ideally, she should have explained the franchise thing to me, changed my drink and called the other store to inform them that their tea was bad. I will never go to any Bosa again. I did call the Chandler store and told her the tea had been mixed with coffee and she thanked me and apologized but it's just unbelievable that the asshole at the McDowell store wouldn't just give me an Iced t."}
{"text":"Can't beat this neighborhood favorite for their excellent light as air, tasty doughnuts.  My absolute favorite is the cinnamon crumb.  Not too sweet but will make your car seats a mess (my preferred area of eating).  Lovely cinna sweet deliciousness!"}
{"text":"My favorite place ever. When I am in phoenix I always stop here for a dozen. I take them home and they last for a couple of day."}
{"text":"Came in thinking was going to get my usual donuts.. Well I did get my donuts and they were very good surprised to say.  I ordered Donut Holes, Apple Fritter and Buttermilk Donut.. In order of my favorites first.. I like them more than dunkin donuts yet close to or more than krispy kreme.  Very Soft, fresh with good flavor.. Service was not so great but would return for these yummy donuts either way and hope for better service next time.."}
{"text":"Deliciously  sweet and fresh doughnuts. The place is clean and the staff is very friendly. Glad I found this place near me!"}
{"text":"Best donuts I've had in the Phoenix area. I wish there were some locations up in the NE section of town."}
{"text":"Been here several times, always drive through. Sandwiches, breakfast sandwiches, drinks and donuts always what was ordered. Always fresh and tasty. Prompt and friendly service. Good job, Bosa!"}
{"text":"Absolutely AVERAGE donuts; not terrible but nothing special. To be honest I'd give the QT a higher mark for donuts than Bosa."}
{"text":"There's not a lot to say about Bosa.  It's delicious, it's cheap and convenient.  Their coffee is also surprisingly great too !  I am an avid donut eater and I have to say this is right up there next to Krispy Kreme!  Even when the drive-thru is super backed up they're always very speedy and you never wait too long.  I'm nervous and happy that I moved right next to one.  Look out bikini season!"}
{"text":"Terrible place. Cold, dry donuts. The guy who runs the place is just downright rude. Saw a few cockroaches in the building too when I walked in. They get angry at you if they don't understand what you want to order. I'd rather drive over 40 minutes to go to the Phoenix location"}
{"text":"Really have the most wonderful donuts. I have dunkin donuts by my house  but I drive right by on way to BoSA."}
{"text":"Amazing donuts! Seriously, the best donuts I have ever had in my life. And, their jalapeno and ham croissants are worth making the drive from Sacramento for. We went there three times during a week long trip to Scottsdale after reading the reviews on Yelp. Worth the 20-minute drive every time. Bosa Donuts, we will miss you!!!"}
{"text":"I go to Bosa a lot. The donuts from this location were very small and tasted like they were made the day before. Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"I went to the bosa in Phoenix and fell in love so i thought i would try this one out.  I was disappointed.  I ordered a piña colada smoothie with boba and it tastes like water with really really sweet indistiguishable syrup at the bottom. Also,  the boba in the drink was so soft like it was over saturated. The whole reason i fell in love with bosa was their crumb donuts.  I tried the crumb donuts at this location and i don't think i even like them anymore.  I'll just stick with the Phoenix location from now on."}
{"text":"hands down the best donuts in town so many to choose froma nd the 24/7 open drive thru is the shizz!
good boba too and a fantastic selection of drinks"}
{"text":"This Bosa is The best in Mine opinion.  From their .99 cent dozen donut holes to their Deeeeeeelicious bear claws, this place gets it right all of the time.  They have taken over where Dunkin Donuts left off.  DD got rid of their old donut recipe and replaced it with the crap they have now.  Well........evidently Bosa found that old recipe and even improved it.  Love this place!!"}
{"text":"you must try the buttermilk bar! it's truly amazing and melts in your mouth! their old fashioned is wonderful too! have tried the apple fritter, too - never disappointed. we (shamelessly) got a huge selection of donuts today including Boston creme, glazed raised, glazed old fashion, powdered raspberry filled, chocolate cake glazed and apple filled. wow, if I'm ever having a donut craving, this is the place to go. definitely coming back, over and over again!"}
{"text":"Be Careful...This Place Can Be Dangerous ... if you're on a diet.  The donuts here are seriously good!  We have been to several locations and used to drive 40 minutes to one out on the east side in Gilbert or Chandler.  When they opened up here, I knew I was in trouble,  because i have to drive by there daily and be tempted to go in there.  This is truly a treat and the store is very nice inside.  I'm glad someone gets up early to make the donuts!!!   Whoever you are .. you need a raise (or more tips) because you are a magician.  Thanks Bosa...you guys are great!"}
{"text":"Good, cheap donuts. The service is pretty fast. Don't expect the latest cronut-type fad pastry here, but whatever you get, it'll be good."}
{"text":"My wife introduced me to Bosa donuts when someone had brought them into work and she brought me one to try. I was instantly hooked. The raised glazed are my favorites as they melt in your mouth. Crispy Creme has nothing on these guys.

Unfortunately at the time there were no locations near our home. I had stopped by several other locations and had mixed results; one had closed early because they ran out of donuts and the other's donuts for some reason all tasted like coconut even though they didn't have any on them.

This review is for the 75th Avenue and Cactus location. They are open 24/7 and are always well-stocked. I've noticed during my last two visits that the donuts seem to be bigger. No complaints here. Also once they threw in extra donuts for free for some reason and I couldn't turn them down.

I do wish they'd make a lemon-filled donut with powdered sugar. That is my all-time favorite but the closest they have is a glazed version which is still really good. My wife inquired about this and they claimed if we give them 24 hour advanced notice they can make me some. I've yet to take them up on that offer as getting donuts from here is usually an impulse decision."}
{"text":"Super moist, sugary and delicious donuts and awesome smoothies WITH boba!  

You can't lose!"}
{"text":"Sooo good and fresh! I'm a sucker for plain glazed donuts and there's are so plump, doughy, and delicious. You can really tell their fresh. Nice selection of assorted donuts and I haven't had one that wasn't good. Their coffee isn't bad either, especially for a cheap donut spot. Drive thru and combo meals are convenient and service is always great."}
{"text":"I'm in trouble because this place just opened up less than 2 miles from my house.  This place used to be the old Luu's Chicken Bowl. The donuts are fresh, light and perfectly sweet!  My favorite so far is the good ole' powdered donut.  There's also another one that has some kind of cream inside while powdered on the outside.  The place just opened last week so obviously they have some kinks to work out.  

Oh but one negative thing I have to say is how the owners family was there on one of the opening days, and one of the older gentleman (possibly owners father) was lounging on the couch and took his shoes off and put his BARE feet on top of the coffee table. I was so grossed out."}
{"text":"I hate to give a negative review especially when I didn't try their product today.

Forgoing the normal birthday cake this year for donuts! My son has picked a camouflage/Call of Duty theme. Printed a camo donut picture from online to use as reference.

Went on a late Thursday morning to find the place empty. Walking in we were overwhelmed by the strong smell of Pinesol. I can take that as a good thing...I guess. The place did look clean, I will give the one star for that.

I pull out the pic ready to ask the gentleman behind the counter if I could...\"We don't do that!\" He didn't even let me finish my question. So, I asked if I could get green glaze, I can make the brown. Nope. 

It wasn't so much as they couldn't accommodate my request it was how unbelievably rude he was about it. This Bosa is extremely close to us but I will now go out of my way and go to Rainbow or Bashas. Sorry Bosa you lost a customer."}
{"text":"I had an oil change in the area and I'd promised DD we could get donuts so... Bosa it was.

We ordered a half dozen donuts which included a fritter (for me), two sprinkled donuts (for her), a chocolate raised (for mom) and two maple bars (for DH).

The donuts were not warm like they'd been when we ordered them from the Tempe location, but I think it is just the time of day we were there (10:45).  

Still, they were uber fresh and yummy.  DD was very pleased, and DH was so surprised to have his beloved maple bars when he got home that he nearly jumped out of his seat and kissed me just at hearing the words.  

The icing on the donut (see what I did there)?  They have a drive thru.  Normally I would just park and go in, but I had my dog and my kid in the car with me... and it was a hot day.  The drive thru made all the difference!"}
{"text":"Love the Glazed and Chocolate Donut Holes.

Unfortunately they were out of chocolate donut holes. In fact they only had 2 1/2 dozen glazed but I got there around 745 pm.

When these donuts are fresh out of the oven they are one of the best in town. 

I like Bosa and Krispy Kreme as top 2, I always get the donut holes but the regular donuts are also top notch. 

I like the Boston Creme and the wide variety that they offer.

Tried the strawberry smoothie and it is good but I prefer a strawberry slush from other places and my daughter is not big on their boba ice tea drinks.

Stay with the donuts and you can't loose.

Will be back for the donuts over and over again."}
{"text":"Small locally owned business with great donuts, very close to the best in town, definitely one of my favorites.

I love the donut holes in chocolate and glazed where you get 5 dozen for $5.00, which makes great snacks for a small group or office.

For regular size donuts, you can not go wrong on any, but my favorites are the Boston Creme and Glazed, all donuts are so fresh and soft.

If you have not tried these, I recommend the fresh soft warm gems."}
{"text":"Been to many other Bosa Donut places before, this one is close to my house, but it does not have a drive thru.

Bosa is one of my favorite donut places, but this one does not have chocolate donut holes!! Those are my favorite, a cross between a donut and cake. If they start to stock chocolate donut holes, could be persuaded to change rating.

This location is next to the Discount Tire."}
{"text":"Donuts and coffee were great! But the dining in experience was brought waaaaaay down by the dummy who decided that when people are eating would be the perfect time to start mopping. Right next to us. We were the only ones there, too. Not only was dirty floor water splashing around our food, but the cleaner is so strong it burned into my nostrils so it was hard to enjoy the taste of donuts and coffee. Poor management. But, if you're driving through or taking out -- by all means, it's good quality food and drink."}
{"text":"So, my childhood donut shop is still safe atop the donut throne.  

 I would never cheat on my favorite donut shop (except with Krispy Kreme a few times).  But I was drawn here after having their buttermilk donut.  I finally brought myself to stop in this donut shop after having had a Buttermilk Bosa donut a few months ago at work. What an amazingly good donut, when it is fresh.  I've had that donut 3 times and the first 2 times I had it, the donut was simply AMAZING.  Something that tastes that good scares me.  I was afraid I would be drawn to this place over and over for that donut.

So, on a weak day, when I just wanted something sweet.... NOW.  I pulled into this shop at about 4 in the afternoon.  I see the yummy \"specialty donut\" in the display and quickly order it.  I get in my car and I don't immediately pull off as I whip out that donut to break off the first piece.  I take a bite and I'm suddenly shocked.... disappointed.  It was STALE.  I wondered how long that donut had been in the display.  It wasn't very good.  i have resolved to never return -- a lie!  I should stop lying to myself.   Nothing that good could possibly, truly be that good. 

Someone at work brought 3 dz of these donuts this week.  I resisted.  I resisted.  but I'm sure.. in that weak moment, I'm returning for that buttermilk yummy goodness.  But I've learned my lesson, I'm going first thing in the morning... I want a fresh one.

Yumms!"}
