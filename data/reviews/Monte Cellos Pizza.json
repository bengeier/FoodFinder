{"text":"Three of us dined at Monte Cellos on a Sunday afternoon, and each had different dishes and appetizers. The restaurant was empty; I now know why: The food generally lacked inspiration, and appeared to be recipes uninformed by culinary tradition. For example, my \"Mediterranean Pasta\" was penne, artichokes, kalamata olives, tomatoes, feta, and chicken that I paid extra for. However, no sauce bound these ingredients together, and no herbs could be tasted. It didn't even taste as though the line cooks salted the water for the pasta, either. We were very disappointed--and this is after eating Boston Market and Qdoba all weekend on a quick flight in to look for houses in the area. One last thing: Two of us got rather ill with diarrhea after eating here. Sorry about the dirty detail, but it's relevant in this case. If you go, stick to their pizzas, which appear to be the only item on the menu getting a thumbs up from locals."}
{"text":"Nice, casual Italian restaurant in the heart of Sewickley.   Serves great pastas, pizzas, and subs!  Perfect for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"One word, TERRIBLE! As a former Sewickley native I saw the first beginnings of this place, and my opinion is the same now as it was then. The food is the furthest thing from good italian. For a town that has such a large demographic of italians, you would think there would be a good restaurant that caters to them. Furthermore, the management is poor and the service is reflected by it. As the gentlemen above stated, the prices at this place are cheap. however, you do get what you pay for. If you want GOOD italian food than try Zara's in east oakland. I went there the last time I came home, and it was the closest thing to homemade italian food."}
{"text":"Vunderbar! I love the place.. It used to be a car dealership so it has big windows on three sides that give you a nice view outside...      if you go on Sunday- Thursday a spaghetti dinner for four is $17.95 and includes a soup or salad for each person and bread.     But don't let me lead couples astray, it is appropriate for dates.. the last time I went I saw a couple leaning across their table holding hands and giving eachother what looked like a passionate stare"}
