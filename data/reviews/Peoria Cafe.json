{"text":"Corned beef hash and home fries mushy. English muffin a shade below warm. Coffee and eggs were great though. I did have to get my own refill on coffee lol. It was a busy Sunday, so they probably didn't have time to get everything right. The owners are very nice, and the servers are pleasant."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here twice for breakfast and the food was fantastic! We went once on a Saturday and once on a Sunday. The only negative thing was that the service was a little slow (the time we went on Sunday, our waitress was overwhelmed). I don't really consider it a problem though because we could see how busy the staff was with people lined up outside to get a table. Overall, a great place and I will be back!"}
{"text":"The only meal worth eating here is the fish fry. The breading is light and they give you a huge portion! The mashed potatoes and gravy were awful. No flavor. The french toast tasted like toast with sugar on it. Eggs had no flavor. They even messed up making chocolate milk. We will not go back again. If my husband wants the fish fry he will have to order it to go as that is the only meal worth going for."}
{"text":"went there for breakfast.  service was good, prices lower than many other breakfast places and the food was cooked perfectly.  what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Great family styled restaurant love the fish fry Fridays.  And service is usually above and beyond.  Good food fast service great experience with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Was in the area visiting family and decided to stop in for breakfast.  There was really nothing special about it, it was they typical breakfast and not that great.  I got the denver omelet and hash browns with a biscuit.  My omelet was really good.  The veggies and ham were cut up into big chunks, which I prefer over them being diced, eggs were cooked perfectly and there was plenty of cheese. The hash browns were the typical hash browns, however, I felt the portion was way too big.  I think I had more hash browns than I did omelet.  My biscuit was dry and very, very dense.  My husband and I are pancake freaks and we always get a side of pancakes to share with our breakfast.  I'm assuming the pancakes were over stirred, they were pretty chewy and tough.  My daughter got the breakfast burrito and said it was o.k.  Probably won't return as its on the other side of town from where I live and we were not very impressed with the food."}
{"text":"This place is my absolute favorite after church.  The owner and the entire staff are so kind.  Great food and so fresh!!"}
{"text":"We paid our first visit to the Peoria Cafe tonight and came away extremely satisfied with our meal and our service!!  The owner's daughter took great care of us and paid special attention to our questions and requests!  The food (fish fry) was excellent and a great value!  We will be going back again real soon and will spread the word to our friends and neighbors about our fantastic experience!"}
{"text":"Went back for fish fry Friday again. Even better the second time. The fish was better, the coleslaw was better, the tartar sauce was on point. Am I going back next Friday? Yuppppppp."}
{"text":"I read the reviews so I thought I would give it a try.....  Not a very clean place...DEAD flies in window seal that they sat us at. The waitress was not that excited or well informed about the menue choices... i ordered an egg over medium(means all the white is cooked only runny yoke...nope didn't happen )...the bacon... well was a total discrace.. however they did put good thick bacon on the burger???? total bacon discrimination... the sausage was grey and rubberie and had a twang.. not sure if it was even pork... had burnt mozzarella sticks...with no cheese... home fries from the KIDS MENU ..had about a half a bottle of pepper in it( hey if the home fries are heavy peppered .. maybe you should say that when kids order...ijs) they gave my grits to someone else. . So i just cancelled those(may have dodged a bullet on that one!!) My blueberry pancakes where crispy on one side not really sure what technique that is called...(and no my waitress was no help) but I guess I  should have paid more attention to the 1st sign when they  brought out water cups that had been knawed all around the top by an angry gerbal!!!!. I say don't expect anything cause  you will be 100% disapointed!!"}
{"text":"Eating a \"works omelette\" with hash browns right now.  Its great.  Older crowd, so you know its the place for breakfast.  Definitely recommend, cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is a nice local cafe. I had never been here before so decided to check it out. I ordered Mike's special plate which is thinly sliced steak with green peppers and onion with a side of refried beans. Amazing. Hubby ordered San Francisco burger and loved every bite. This would be a great place for breakfast. Prices are fair portions are huge. Great place  We will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"My parents took me here Friday night for the fish dinner. I wasn't expecting much for $7.99 but the fish was great! The servings are 200% bigger than you would expect and it was awesome. Service was friendly and fast. Place was packed and now I know why."}
{"text":"so we finally stopped in for breakfast.... I say finally because we drive by this lace at least three times a week.  The whole plaza it sits in has been remolded, and we discovered that the cafe has been too - it looks great.  I wouldn't call the cafe 'cozy', but I will take new and clean  over dingy and outdated any time.  Breakfast was only slightly above average, but taking the service and the price into consideration earns the cafe four starts.    If you want fast and satisfactory food and a moderate price, this is a good option to place  on your rotation.    I don't think we would swing by for dinner - not our style, but we WILL be back for breakfast.  I suspect we will be stopping by for lunch at some point too."}
{"text":"I really like this place! The pancakes are great, the people are friendly and prices are reasonable. Nothing fancy, no gimmicks, simple and good!"}
{"text":"Foods good but service is a little lost. Got forgot about back in the corner. Price & food help overcome this flaw."}
{"text":"Great Mom and Pop place. Ample food at a great price and tastes like home cooking. We like to go for breakfast, but also went for friday fish fry. It's all good."}
{"text":"1 st time for fish fry.  Really good and plenty with single serving. Cinnamon flavor in batter. Very busy, but nice.  I'll be coming back for breakfast.."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile, and it did not disappoint!  The chorizo and eggs were so flavorful, loved the fresh made salsa that came with it too!  My son had the mickey pancake and it was so cute, tasty too!  My husband had the italian sausage omelet, which was very good also. It was pretty packed when we walked in, however were seated right away.  We have been looking for a great breakfast spot near our home, and we finally found one that can stand up!   Yes!  This is a scary thing... I am pretty sure we will be regulars!"}
{"text":"I have to say. My employee has been wanting me to try their fish fry here. OMG. Some of the best fish fry I've ever tasted. They know their doing here. The bread pudding words can't even describe. Your taste buds will be all over the place. That's how delicious this was. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food and a family atmosphere! I love their burgers. Their staff is friendly and helpful. My family has come here for years"}
{"text":"I went in on a Friday for lunch, I HAD to try the fish fry after reading all these great reviews about it.  Im sad to say that I was dissapointed with the fish fry.  The batter was good, but the fish didnt taste so good.  The place was extremely busy, so it might just be me that didnt enjoy it; I might return and try out some breakfast, hopefully that is a little better."}
{"text":"They sat us down and completely forgot about us. No one asked for drink order, we were by the hostess and they were just standing around talking. So we got up and left but made sure the hostess new why we were leaving. Horrible service and not that crowded."}
{"text":"I dined at this restaurant for the Friday Fish Fry.   The food was fine and reasonable.    My problem was with the staff.   Upon getting ready to leave I asked for a to-go box.    Our table had NO reorders or seconds.   We simply wanted to take with us that which was originally served.   Again, we would not expect to take home leftovers if we had ordered seconds or utilized the ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT menu.   We originally ordered a single serve and an all you can eat plate (not utilized).   Mgmt. would not oblige us and refused a to-go container.   They were not pleasant to us.     NEVER AGAIN.    Why would they publicly argue with customers ?"}
{"text":"I have dined here every Saturday morning for the past two months. I won't eat breakfast from anywhere else. The portions are so huge I have enough for my breakfast on Sunday as well. The staff is wonderful. I will certainly eat here again. I order an omelette with bacon, ham, and sausage,  home fries, cinnamon raisin toast, and coffee."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, good food at a decent cost and fast service. It's a nice diner style restaurant, nothing fancy but clean, modern and I will say it again \"friendly staff.\""}
{"text":"This is the best place for Friday fish fry in the west valley. I was going to go for the all you can eat, but the waitress, said maybe I should see what the regular plate looks like. I got 4 nice filets, perfectly fried. Not greasy.  I will come back, definitely."}
{"text":"My first time in Peoria Cafe, recommended by a friend. Told me to order the fish dinner on Friday night . Wow very good decent price , love the fish with baked potato and the creamy cole slaw. You can get with fries ,mash potato or baked potato if you want. It was packed very busy and still got me a table less than 2 minutes wow. Well that was my first time but I will go again and try the other dishes. go check it out Ioved it."}
{"text":"This is my single favorite place to go for breakfast on the west side. Ive gone here since I was a small child. The food is always amazing. The portions are filling."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast and awesome staff"}
{"text":"WOW WHAT A PLACE. Had lunch for the first today I had a 1/2 lb bacon cheeseburger with fry's. It was the best Berger I haven't eaten in years.   Thick juicy and jest dam Good.. The fry's were crisp and hot very good. My wife had the open face Hot Beef Sandwich. And could not eat it all. She is lets say a bit picky when it comes to her hot beef and said this is very very good. She brought what she could not finish home.   We will be going back for breakfast this weekend. I suggest you give it a try. And will will be doing the fish fry on Friday night. We will let you know how it is."}
{"text":"Eat local, folks.  Seriously though. This place makes me feel at home every darn time I walk in the door. And the food is so good. So so so good. And $7.99 for breakfast that covers the entire plate? crazy. We're talking chicken fried steak. Thats a heck of a deal. If you live in peoria try this place out. Just make sure you get there early because they close at 2. There's always a crowd but I've never once had to wait. Staff is always friendly!"}
{"text":"The Fish fry is awesome, and I always liked going there, but what happened to my parents last Friday evening was just horrible I thought. If you've eaten there, you know how much food they give you on a regular order. Well my parents are both in their 80's and they don't eat much anymore, well they can't even finish an order between the two of them. Well they ordered one meal and asked the waitress for another plate so they could share it, well the waitress told them they could not do that. They both needed to order their own meal, so in order for my mom to stay at the table she needed to order something for herself. Well she refused and then the waitress then went to the owners and she proceeded to tell her the same thing, so she ended up having to order a bowl of soup. She told the owner that this was the last time she would be eating at their restaurant. And that goes for me and my wife as well!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here, just basic diner/cafe food, but they do it well. Our breakfasts were cooked perfectly and the waitstaff is very friendly."}
{"text":"This was the first time me and my wife.  The cafe is a clean and busy with a lot of customers.   As soon as we sat down the waitress took our drink orders and then gave us time go thru the menu.    Not even couple of minutes has gone by and another person from the wait staff came by to make sure if someone has came by to take our order. That itself impressed us.  When the waitress came back to take our order, she was very helpful and patient  answering questions.  We both ordered the fish fry plate and salad with some extra toppings.  They give you 4 good size fish with your plate that were good. Now in our experience of going to restaurants of different types, they were always either good food and bad service or bad food and good service.  It's rare to find a place that has great service and great food.  We will definitely be coming back here again.  Thank you Peoria Cafe."}
{"text":"We just recently found this little gem and we are so glad we did!  When we first came in and was seated we were waited on by Missy and hit it off just like we were old friends...we picked her brain for me u favorites and trusted the norm...since then we have been back regularly and countless times and enjoyed everything we have tried on the menu, seems like we cannot go wrong!  We were introduced to the owner and she definitely has a knack for hiring, the entire staff has been phenomenal and the bussers are johnny-on-the-spot when it comes to your drinks, the refills, and any needs they can attend with...keep up the fantastic work Peoria Cafe Staff!  We cannot tell you how much we look forward to visiting!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed, the breakfast is very bland.  And way to much cheese,No flavor what ever. I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. It was very disappointing. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Best fish fry ever! Great food, excellent service, friendly owners...the list goes on and on! Highly recommend that you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!!   My friend Ann and I have become Sunday morning regulars and we love the food and atmosphere!  Sitting at the counter is our favorite, so we can visit with our favorite waitress, Angelica! ....and the price is right!!  Their pancakes are larger than their plates, hope you have a huge appetite and everything else is mighty tasty, nothing disappoints me here!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place on the way out of Phoenix heading NW to Nevada. Excellent food, our sever Missy was terrific! Very busy for a weekday morning, always a good sign."}
{"text":"Went in for the Friday night fish fry. This is your typically Midwestern style fish fry. Service was very friendly & fast. Had ordered the cup of clam chowder to start off with but it seemed to be a bowl size although on the bill it was deemed cup size. Chowder didn't have much flavor to it at all. Just thick, white & creamy with a few pieces of clams. Not impressed have had much better. Before I could even complete eating my bowl of chowder my Friday night fish fry single serve ($7.99) arrived. It had 4 large pieces of fish with french fries (could have ordered baked potato or mashed) with a side of cole slaw & a roll. Fish was very fresh tasting & the batter was not greasy at all but the batter lacked flavor. Points for batter not being greasy as most places have greasy batter fried fish. Cole slaw lacked flavor as well. Seemed that it was just thinned out mayonnaise with cabbage. Tarter sauce could have used some thinning out as it was just mayonnaise with relish in it. Fries were soggy & cold & lacked salt. Salt wouldn't stick to them since they were cold. Didn't try the rolls since I already had enough starch on my plate they were soft though when I did touch one.    Although this review seems rather negative I am giving Peoria Cafe 3 stars based on service & the fact that the fish tasted extremely fresh, was not greasy & such a large portion. THe batter just needed a bit of seasoning & since I wenmt there primarily for the fish I think I would go back for the fish again but next time I would get a baked potato."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and attentive. Food is great, the portions are huge and the prices are cheap. :)"}
{"text":"Awesome local joint. Good food, fast service, and your coffee cup will not be empty. I have only been here for breakfast,  and have not been disappointed. Check it out."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite weekend breakfast spot!  They have great specials and the service is great.  I've only had breakfast at this place, so I'm not sure how their lunch/dinner options fare."}
{"text":"Breakfast was ok. Mexican omelette and Denver. Home fries were mushy- boiled cubed white potatoes. Not very good. Omelettes were ok."}
{"text":"Three words: FISH FRY FRIDAY.  Have you ever been to a backwoods bar in Wisconsin that has an all-you-can-eat fish fry on a Friday night for practically nothing?  If you answered \"no\" to that question, then I invite you to experience the Peoria Cafe. It's the next best thing, right here in Arizona!  What you will get is reasonable prices, friendly service, and a good, old-fashioned Friday night fish fry.  The downside is that they only serve until 8 (?!?!) and I don't think they serve alcohol; everyone knows that a truly awesome fish fry is complimented by a brandy old-fashioned and/or a microbrew.  I would give a few points for their delicious home-made ranch dressing.  My advice: pre-drink and head over to the Peoria cafe for a great fried fish dinner!"}
{"text":"Food is great.But 3 time in row the handicap  parking was full of bikes (4 spots).I am  sure they are not that  handicap."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the Peoria Cafe. The food was very good (menudo and a Denver omelet), the price was great, and the servers were super friendly. Oh, and the food was prepared quickly! Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a decent breakfast place since I moved to Arizona from the Chicago area and I was disappointed on the quality of food at this establishment. My hash browns were cold and my friend's Reuben was so buttery he couldn't eat it. The coffee is great which is a plus. The server was nice, but I won't be coming back to this place anytime time soon."}
{"text":"Great, fast service, the server kept the coffee topped. Best raisin toast, ask for corn beef hash well done and it's perfect."}
{"text":"The fish fry is exceptional. You get so much on your plate, big pieces of fried cod, fries and cole slaw.  The service is quick and efficient. I could not imagine anyone ordering All You Can Eat.....the single order is more than plenty."}
{"text":"Had the ribeye with Home fries the potatoes were terrible I asked for the steak medium well it was well over done yeah only thing that was good was the eggs and the toast so I don't recommend this place"}
{"text":"Nobody makes great eggs it seems, but me! It's ok but eggs are a important part of breakfast!"}
{"text":"Labor Day was a busy day to have my first breakfast here but it was worth the hour or so wait. I got the two egg breakfast with hash browns and biscuit and gravy, side of crispy bacon. It was worth the wait. The servers were all super friendly and apologized for the wait with a free bowl of menudo. Coffee was always full. All in all great place but probably not on a holiday."}
{"text":"We arrived at 8:10 for breakfast and had to leave by 9AM for an appointment. Place was really busy. We were seated quickly and a server asked what we would like to drink. They didn't know we were in a bit of a hurry so all of the service is prompt! The husband was going to meet us there so we ordered a coffee for him. After looking over a lengthy menu, our waitress arrived, asked if we knew what we wanted, saw the coffee and vacant chair and asked if she should wait. I told her we needed to order so we did - Croissant breakfast sandwich, she happily offered to change my French toast to regular wheat instead of Texas style toast (+1egg, 2bacon), and the 2-meal (2 eggs, 2bacon, 2cakes). As soon as she walked away, the husband arrived. She saw him sit down, came over after giving him a few minutes and took his order (cornbeefhash, eggs and hash browns I think).  We were served our food barely 10 minutes later -  including the husband's late order and everything was cooked correctly and tasted great. Coffee refills are offered generously. Love the syrup in the mustard dispenser - no gooey mess! The waitress checked on us and we really had a very nice family breakfast. Two noteworthy reasons for the 5 stars - I never worried we wouldn't be able to finish before we had to leave...the service is so terrific!  And when it was clear to our waitress that we were finished eating but my iced tea was low, she offered me a refill, which I accepted and then asked me if I wanted it in a to-go cup!!! This is a first for me and a very welcome service enhancement. On a hot Saturday morning in Peoria, with errands ahead of me, of course I would like some iced tea to join me.  The cup was really big too! Don't overlook Peoria Café. Especially if you're a local. We need to take care of our small, home-grown businesses, especially in this part of the city. You won't regret your decision to eat here."}
{"text":"The food here is so fresh and they literally bring it out 5 minutes after you order it! Love the great service too!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to the Peoria Cafe for many years. I don't know what happened, but about 2 years ago the quality of the food changed; and not for the better.  Extremely greasy/oily eggs and hash browns, dry sandwiches and cold french fries.  Once in a while, we still go for the Friday fish fry, which is very good, but that's about it."}
{"text":"This place was exactly what we were looking for- an independent diner type of place.  Stopped in here on a Friday and knew I had to try the fish fry.  There is an \"all you can eat\" option but the regular order is 4 large pieces of fish so I went with the regular.  All in all it was great food and great service- Stephanie was our waitress and she did an excellent job.  Thanks for the hospitality!"}
{"text":"Slightly crappy start to this little adventure...walking in my phone got (what the \"man-friend\" likes to call) \"Glendale custom\" aka-I dropped in walking in and shattered the screen. I have insurance and its only a phone so I got over it quick. We walked in and were greeted by an incredibly sweet older lady who later explained she stopped in for a meal one day and next thing she knew she had a hostess job in her spare time. THEN-if that wasn't charming enough we look out the window and see an older John Deere tractor with a grandpa and his grandson just driving to breakfast. Literally they could have served me dog food at this point but the charm had already won me over. And yet-the food was oober yummy. Very home cooked feel. Made me a bit homesick. The staff was awesomely friendly and the atmosphere was fun and light. Very small town feel. Being a small town girl I fell in love. Will be back, hopefully driving in on a John Deere."}
{"text":"I have gone to Peoria Cafe for years! My husband & I went there Sunday morning for breakfast (9/30/12) and will not go back. The service was ok if you don't mind waiting 45 minutes for scrambled eggs, bacon & hash browns due to the fact your breakfast was given to another table! It was so loud in there from customers & from people at the cash register yelling at the waitresses across the room. I was so disappointed! The waitresses were messing with their cell phones, plugging them in behind the cash register.  Plus I heard a few waitresses and the hostess say \"Oh, I'm sorry\" 5 times in about 3 minutes. To me, that's not a good sign. It seemed so unorganized and not like it use to be, I am sorry to say we will not go back"}
{"text":"LOVED IT!!  We're the locals go. We were driving around looking for a good breakfast place before spring training game in Peoria. Everything seemed to be closed on Sunday in that part of town. Ended up in Peoria Cafe. So glad we did. BEST MENUDO!!  A local also recommended the biscuits and gravy, so we had to order. Super YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"My family and I stopped here for breakfast look like a good family restaurant inside extremely busy so we thought good things We Said down order their food from one person got drinks from another person third person came and brought us our food food was decent and when it came time to pay the bill they hit over charges by over $20 try to talk to a manager waited 20 minutes to talk to a manager and never got it resolved finally just left"}
{"text":"Becky S. gave me exactly what I was hoping for: a good AYCE fish fry review reminiscent of what can be found in my former domicile of Wisconsin. Thanks!  The AYCE fish fry is $10.99 with drinks costing $1.95. However, unless you have a bottomless stomach stick with the cheaper single-plate option because the portions are HUGE!! Both include your choice of potato and small bowl of coleslaw. The coleslaw was primarily just mayo, cabbage, and shredded carrot so I chose not to waste calories by eating it. Celery seed, minced onion, and lemon juice would definitely brighten it up.  The fish, however, is a real winner and after inquiring to our lovely waitress Emily on the difference between AYCE and their regular fish fry, she said the initial portion for AYCE is the same as the single-plate. Whoa! Now I'm a big guy (6'6\", 275) and I could barely finish off my own plate, so next time I'll know to skip the AYCE and go regular fish fry instead. The tartar sauce had plenty of relish but could benefit from a little more lemony tartness (personal preference.) Of course, there's also malt vinegar on each table for diners who fancy that over tartar sauce ...  Peoria Cafe is your typical hometown style cafe with a loud, open atmosphere. Almost as good as Byler's in Black Canyon City but a whole lot closer drive. I'll definitely be back when I crave a Wisconsin-style Friday night fish fry!"}
{"text":"First time I went it was close to closing and I ordered fried shrimp with fries. They were totally over cooked. My friend mentioned it to the waitress who said nothing and did nothing. When we were leaving my friend made a comment towards the kitchen which the manager overheard. My friend walked out the door but I stayed to pay. The manager comped the meal and was extremely apologetic for the quality of food and service. I was totally satisfied with the outcome and knew I'd give it a second try.  My second visit was awesome. Great service, awesome breakfast, great atmosphere! Will definitely be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"This is our local spot for breakfast or brunch. They also do lunch items but we haven't really tried that yet. Have never had a problem parking, there is an outside patio but if you go during the weekday there are often smokers out there so we stay inside. The service is consistently top notch and the staff exhibits great team work. We usually order one of the specials, my favorites are \"the city\" and the monte cristo sandwich. My friend got the steak and eggs on sunday and was happy with it. The coffee was great and always full!  The only downside is the checks/ bill have to be taken to the pay station by the entrance and if it's a weekend crowd, the area gets kinda tight. NOT a big deal but it's a factual situation and some people aren't so patient."}
{"text":"You won't find many places like this is AZ. The staff is friendly and the food is great! My favorite is the chicken quesadilla. Friday fish fry is by far the busiest night of the week because the fish is soooo good. People line out the door to get the fish here; it's amazing. They also have free wifi and takeout! Great service and friendly people. :)"}
{"text":"Well I have to say today will be the last time we eat at the Peoria Cafe. The eggs weren't cooked to order, hash browns weren't even cooked, very cold.   I watched the kitchen from were i was sitting and noticed that they dont take the time with their orders. To busy to cook food the way it is ordered, dont send it out.     Really need to slow down and cook the food better.  And i also noticed the waitress eating bacon and licking her fingers then going over and picking up the toast and putting the butter on. Never washed her hands after eating.  Good Bye Peoria Cafe.  Beatrice."}
{"text":"Waitres looks very tense ... the owner of café is very rude ..!!! How can someone work this owner ... she needs to treat her employees better so they can provide better service"}
{"text":"I have been visiting the Peoria Cafe off and on over the last 20 years or so covering several different owners often with differing levels of food quality and service.  The current owner, who is very hands on and can be seen in the kitchen as well as on the floor, apparently \"gets it\", and it shows. Good food with a good value.  As mentioned previously, this 'locals\" cafe sits within a newly remodeled strip mall.  The cafe interior itself has been remodeled and upgraded over the last couple of years in segments.  The staff is a good mix of of long time and new employees.  Everyone is friendly.  I had breakfast at the cafe this morning for the second time in the last week after a long layoff which had nothing to do with the cafe or it's food and more to the fact that I don't eat breakfast out as much now that I'm retired.  The reason for my re-visit, I wanted to enjoy their new Mexican  Omelette which is principally a mix of chorizo, steak and cheese. My second sampling of this omelette was as good as the first.  Ordered:  Mexican Omelette                 Iced Tea                  Total $11.00  If you want to enjoy a breakfast at a reasonable price, give the Peoria Cafe a try."}
{"text":"We always have family breakfast here. It's always packed with people so everyone must love it. Service is friendly and prices are good. I like them and visit it as often as I can."}
{"text":"Date: February 2012, a Sunday morning around 9AM  Ordered:  1 - Fried Zucchini 2 - Steak and Eggs  1 - Ice Tea  1 - Coffee   Total: $25 to $30  *************  Fried Zucchini - Tasted like fish. Other than the fish oil it was fried in, this was a good deal. The zucchini was cut in quarters lengthwise and you received about 8 pieces, accompanied with ranch.  I am willing to give them a second chance on this dish.    Steak and Eggs - This was a steak just didn't taste right; either it was old or very poor quality. I ordered my steak medium, and it was served well done, not a speck of pink.  The eggs were cooked correctly. The hash browns and toast that this was served with were both on the verge of burnt.   *************  Atmosphere:  Spacious.  This café is large; they have 3 sections, one outside on a gated patio.  There was a group of \"regulars\" sitting at the counter  Service:  The waitress was satisfactory.   *************  Will I be back? Maybe... only if I am craving zucchini and am willing to take a chance.  But then again, Brothers Restaurant is across the street and they are great.    P.S. Currently there is a great deal of construction going on there."}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable price, minimal wait and good service. Would definitely return! Serves breakfast all day which is a plus!  Huge pancakes."}
{"text":"The family and I decided to give the Friday Night Fish Fry a try. I don't regret it... It was good. The service was a tad on the slow side but they were pretty busy. I'd like to see what they have to offer for breakfasts now..."}
{"text":"Eggs are bad other food is pretty good.  This place is nothing special, they try and are friendly but the eggs are gross, as is the coffee. Home Fries and such are pretty decent.  The atmosphere is nice and homey and very country. Seats are comfortable and no real complaints. But for the most part the food is bad. I will not return intentionally"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. They give you SO MUCH food! I'm not kidding. One plate is more than enough for two people. I've had the pancakes which are fluffy and delicious, the Denver omelet which is loaded with bell peppers and ham, and the biscuits and gravy which... Yes, just yes. The biscuits are dense and hearty and the gravy is really peppery and thick. Plus, everything is so inexpensive! Two biscuits and gravy, hash browns, bacon, and two eggs is around 6 dollars and change. The waitresses are wonderful- super friendly and quick. Love coming here for Sunday breakfast!"}
{"text":"Peoria Cafe has a small town diner feel. Good food, decent price, and friendly service."}
{"text":"We just moved to the neighborhood & are so excited to have found our new favorite breakfast joint!! Even though they were super busy the service was outstanding & the food was incredible. There was an  overwhelming number of ppl pouring into the small restaurant that seemed understaffed but the hostess still managed to get everyone seated w/o losing her pleasant demeanor.  The food arrived quickly & was hot & delicious; and the drinks were never empty.. I would recommend the biscuits & gravy, you wont be disappointed. See you next time Peoria Cafe!!!"}
{"text":"Came in here in a rush because my boyfriend had a doctors appointment. We asked the manager if we could finish eating in 30 and she said she could do it in 20!  Our food came out right away... like literally. The manager here is amazing. She runs this place so well. And the food is unbelievably amazing."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the service is fantastic. We originally tried the place for their fish fry....it is the best I have had in a long time. Big pieces and lots of it. We then  tried the breakfast, again amazing. The work omlette has so much stuff in it the you forget your eating eggs, the biscuits and gravy are just like my grandfather used to make.  Good ice tea and great coffee.   Friday thru Sunday it is pretty packed but we have never had to wait more than five minutes or a table. The staff is friendly and they all work to make the experience great"}
{"text":"Friday fish fry 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.  kind of reminds me of a mom and pop shop. I've been here a few times before so I must like it because I keep coming back.  Server's are friendly. Conveniently located close to the post office to run some errands as well. Close to Grand Avenue so it's easy access as well. I probably would have thought about this place today for my lunch but I saw a billboard shortly before their intersection which made me remember that I like this place. Thanks for the billboard reminder!"}
{"text":"No fancy decor or fancy creative anything-infused dishes here. Just what you'd expect from a family style restaurant: kids meals that are more than enough food plus a drink for 3.49; thick french fries that are crisy on the outside and fluffy inside, and a Friday night fish fry that trumps Long John Silver. I really liked the coleslaw. Mike's clam chowder was lumpy and won't be ordered again. The kids liked their meals except the picky one who refused to eat the hot dog after she heard they don't sell many. \"I've had some better hot dogs from a gas station,\" she said.  The wait staff was quite friendly and attentive.  The prices are good and the food is predictable - so if you're in the area and need a place to sit and chat, this cafe fits the bill.  By the way, they have some of the freshest iced tea I've had in a long time. And I'm really picky about my iced tea, if you haven't noticed."}
{"text":"This review is only for the fish fry on Friday, since that all I've ever eaten there.   The good- The Cod is always cooked perfect, the breading is flavorful and not bland like some batter other restaurants use on their fish. Very thin and light, crispy but not over cooked and it's never oily. Honestly, probably the best battered Cod I've had outside of California   The bad- their tartar sauce! I love tartar sauce, especially on battered fish but theirs is sweet and really tastes gross. Tartar sauce is supposed to have dill and lemon and be based with a dill relish. It's obvious they either use sweet relish or add sugar to the sauce.. not good unless you like that sort of thing."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place for the good portions for the price. I always sit by the kitchen so I can watch the cooks. I love the open kitchen concept."}
{"text":"Breakfast food is just ok, it is not very flavorful. But the biscuits are homemade and very fresh! The service is very slow and not nice. We sat on the patio for 10 minutes before anyone came out to see us. Another waitress barely gave us the time of day, we probably saw her 2 times the whole meal."}
{"text":"Fish Fry Fridays!  Cam with the whole famdamily. There was like 12 of us. 95% all got the fish. The staff was efficient, effective and did a good job.   The fish was served with fries and soggy cole slaw. While both were good (not great) the fish was perfect. Perfectly breaded and fried.   Unless you can seriously pack it in, You DO NOT need the all you can eat. None of us could have eaten another bite."}
{"text":"We came for the fish fry.. Fish was great... Mashed potatoes are instant, fries were not crispy .. No baked potatoes available.. Butter is not real butter.. So I ate the fish and left the rest.."}
{"text":"The service and the food is excellent. Bring your family and friends, make sure you have an empty to enjoy great eating."}
{"text":"Great Customer Service and great food at a reasonable price. Very happy I foumd this little spot."}
{"text":"Nice mom and pop place.  Daily specials, etc.  Good, friendly service and decent food."}
{"text":"We call this our breakfast place. You can order anything on the menu and you will not be disappointed.   Breakfast lunch & really dinner And you'll walk out happy after great coffee and ... I believe in family owned and operated this is why. Awesome wait staff. Happy to be there Happy to refill your cup or take a plate away. Solid fresh food made to your request.  Don't know the cook staff but I'll give them a shout out too for great work."}
{"text":"This place is definitely on my going to breakfast short list.  Not very often convenient for me but a very nice place.  Food is always good.  In addition to the daily specials they have a pretty good creamed chipped beef which is something you cannot find every where.  The staff is always friendly and attentive. The place has that comfortable local feel to it you cannot get in a chain."}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time and it most definitely won't be my last, I had a pastrami omelette (Props to the chef Mike) and hash browns that bad boy was amazing so much flavor best omelette I have ever had hands down hash browns was good also. My daughter (2 years old) had the Mickey Mouse pancake which she really enjoyed until she got a bite of that pastrami omelette.....yeah I'm back on that pastrami omelette it was just that damn GOOD. And the service was great"}
{"text":"Very Friendly and quick staff. We went for the first time for breakfast and will definitely be coming back. The prices are so reasonable and the food portions are huge. Breakfast was delicious. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My friends and i were out in AZ on a road trip and before we hraded home we wanted to have a mighty breakfast. Needless to say the Food was pretty good and so was the staff and prices!!!! They have deals of the day. I went with the valley."}
{"text":"Food is what you would expect out of a mom and pop diner, average. My one star is solely based on the service. We didn't get drinks until almost 20 minutes after we sat down. Our waitress overcharged us on several items to pad the check so if decide to go definitely double check your bill before paying. The bulk of our time was waiting for cutlery, a refill, or a condiment. We definitely will not be returning and will discourage others from going as well."}
{"text":"Had a meeting at Peoria PD so came looking for food after it was done.  Peoria Cafe is literally down the street from the City complex so figured I would stop in! First off service was fantastic from the second we walked into the restaurant. We were greeted immediately and sat. They have a nice diner bar you can sit at as well. We took our seats and looked over the menu. BREAKFAST ALL DAY! SCORE! Of course I opted for an omelette and had to try their potatoes. My co-worker opted for a sandwich. Both meals were great. My only tiny complaint is I felt the potatoes were under cooked. But then I am a hashbrown/country potato connoisseur so maybe a bit picky.   The place is super clean, service is very attentive (my water never got down half way before someone came to refill) and the food was great.  When in Downtown Peoria come by and try them out!"}
{"text":"Family run business which is what I look for. Im not into chain restaurants.  Very good breakfast choices. They serve Menudo as well.  Friendly staff and decent prices.  Get the greek salad dressing (even though its pink in color), its amazing."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food... good service. Try the pastrami omelet. A masterpiece!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I wasn't expecting this place to be as good as it was. I was pleasantly surprised.  The food. Every piece of my food was cooked perfectly. Bacon, eggs, toast, everything. While this may not seem a big deal, but we had a big party with us, and our whole table got their food at the same time. It all looked good.   Service. The lady was nice and stopped by often with drinks. Good on her.   Price. Great price for better quality food than some other breakfasts chains I've been to.   Overall, will come back for sure.   -Coty"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday morning. They were very busy but service and food was excellent. Serving portions are huge and well worth the price. This place is a must do if your hungry for a quality comfort food."}
{"text":"This place is way better than anything I've ever had before. It's absolutely amazing. Breakfast, lunch......Fish Fry Friday!!!! I love it. Best Friday dinner ever. I'll drive from cave creek just for this place anytime. Staff is super super friendly and always makes me feel like I'm at home. Minus the dishes. Defiantly a must try in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Service has been slowly going down hill. Been there 5 times now. Always around 730 in the morning every other Saturday. Started out great but the last two times the servers have been slow and today we were sat and for the next 10 minutes, servers passed us by and didn't even acknowledge us. We were sat at table 81, right next to the coffee cart and the patio door. They may have just lost us as customers."}
{"text":"On my first visit I thouroghly enjoyed this place. From the food to the staff, everything was great and makes you want to come back to explore more. With a vast menu covering everything breakfast and beoynd, there was bound to be a return trip.  On my return trip in my waitress was so rude it's turned me off from eating again inside this establishment. When asked if I could do a substitution (due to an allergy) she looked at me as if I was an idiot and rudely asked, \"well like what? what do you want me to do?\". She was unable to comprehend that I had asked her a question and then proceeded to say \"that's not something we do. Well wait, I'm new, let me check...\", so ordering something different became an immediate choice. If you don't know something, don't be rude, just ask.  From now on I will order out from this place which I have done with success several times since my first visit. The friendliness of the other staff and food still gives hope for this place, but in the end the actions of one representing a whole diminish the brightness that was."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for lunch on Saturday. We always try out local cafes, especially if they have good ratings.   The service here was excellent as we were seated immediately and taken well care of throughout our meal.   I ordered the chef's salad. It was huge and wonderful. The lettuce was so fresh I would have thought it was just picked. The other items--meat, cheese, tomatoes and eggs--were as tasty and fresh. The ranch dressing was really good. I'd order this again if I got back in town, but I put half of it in a take home container before I started. It's two meals for sure. My husband ordered the twin salads of tuna salad and cottage cheese. He raved about the fresh greens and the tuna salad.   Two very full and completely satisfied people will look forward to a return trip to Peoria."}
{"text":"I may have dropped in at a bad time, but my breakfast was... well, awful. I ordered a simple two eggs over easy, bacon, home fries, and rye toast. What could possibly go wrong?   The eggs and rye toast were fine. The bacon was thin and limp. But the so-called home fries were abysmal. There was not a hint of crispness. It was like they were steamed rather than fried. A comment to the waitress was left unheeded, she seemed more interested in the table of eight loud and boisterous seniors. (BTW, I'm a senior)   Probably won't go back, but they seem to have a loyal following, so my boycott won't matter much."}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome service.. We went mothers day morning and they were packed. But didn't have to wait long at all. Also service was great for as busy as they were.."}
{"text":"We've been here before on trips through the area, and were looking forward to the tasty breakfast we've had before. It was very disappointing. The service was fine, but the food was meh. The hash browns were barely cooked and the English muffin under my so-so Eggs Benedict were so tough, I felt like I was sawing wood. The sauce was just warm and had little taste. My husband had pork chops and said they were tasty, but his hash browns were also mushy. I'm sorry they've lost the magic touch, but this visit was a disappointment."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Peoria Cafe for the first time this past Friday 4/20 specifically for the all you can eat Fish N Chips. We both ended up getting them single serving fish in chips and the batter was perfect not salty and you get more fish then batter and it was absolutely delicious! Can't wait to go on the weekend to try their Menudo! Oh and their homemade bread pudding was bomb! Thank you for the awesome 1st time experience and the wonderful service!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going there for 30 years and it keeps getting better. Chef salad I'd so awesome! You could eat it for three days."}
{"text":"Always amazing food.   They treat us like we are family.   The staff care about our needs and know just how we like items.   Always fast and friendly.   Love the oatmeal and biscuits and gravy.  Coffee is always refreshed ands hot.  Make sure to stop in and try the cowboy breakfast.   Yummmmmm!"}
{"text":"Friday fish fries are a must! The staff is always incredibly friendly and the food is always fast and delicious. A great place for kids, they have mickey mouse pancakes that are adorable. They need better bathrooms but that is minor issue with the great food that they have!"}
{"text":"In the 8 yrs we have lived in peoria, this is our go to breakfast place. Kid friendly- have crayons and coloring pages- quick, huge portions and relatively good prices. We will continue to support local business over chain."}
{"text":"Meh. Inadequate service, disorganized. Nothing seemed fresh for this breakfast spot. The swiss cheese on my omelette was a kraft single thrown on top on the eggs, they couldn't even be bothered to melt it inside the omlette. The hash browns were frozen. Go to Brothers across the street; they at least no how to cook a proper meal."}
{"text":"So I think it's the amount of people they are trying to pack in this joint that makes the noise so much louder, but I had a hard time just talking to my friend in front of me without having to speak louder. Regardless, the food was pretty basic. Big portions and it filled me up. The potatoes were pretty good, but I douse mine in ketchup. My omelet didn't have a lot of taste but the raisin bread was SO GOOD. I love raisin bread and they buttered it perfectly. The coffee has a very woodsy taste and I drink it black so it wasn't too strong and wasn't too weak.  Our waitress was a little odd. She was apologizing for everything even when nothing was wrong, so I'm not sure if it was from a bad experience with a customer on her part or what, but it was kind of annoying.  Overall, the food was average, service was average. Nothing special about it."}
{"text":"My 5 year old daughter and I stopped into this place for breakfast while we were waiting for our car to get fixed across the street. This was our first time here and I have to say I love, love, love this place. First, if you are feeling overwhelmed by things going on in the world or people being unkind to each other on social media this place will remind you that people are still kind to one another, you can feel loved and you won't be able to help but leave with a smile. My daughter and I sat at the counter which is right in front of the huge open kitchen. The first thing you'll notice is the friendly customer service. Everyone one on staff, even the cooks, are friendly. The next thing you'll notice is the way the staff gets along. It is literally like you have been invited over for a meal with a big, huge family. They talk and sometimes bicker just like family, but it never makes you feel uncomfortable because you can honestly see, just like with family there is a love for one another. The next thing that you will notice is the people around you. All talking and enjoying each other's company. Chatting and laughing with the staff. Talking about everything from politics to ball games but all with big smiles on their faces even if they are disagreeing. I can only speak to breakfast because that is what we had but it was amazing!!!! Hot and big portions. My daughter got the Mickey Mouse Pancake with bacon and hot chocolate. Our server, Annie, even gave my daughter a second helping of whipped cream on her hot cocoa. I got the 2 eggs, bacon, hash browns and half order of biscuits and gravy. Everything was cooked perfectly, hot and tasted great. Another thing that I thought was great was that no one was on their cell phone, religiously. Sometimes people would take a call but generally people seemed to be just enjoying one another's company. I gave our server a 100% tip, which I never do. That, alone, says a lot about what I thought about this place. Go check it out. You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Came here with my friend for breakfast. We were seated immediately, had drinks delivered right away and our order was taken within about 5 minutes. Our food came out incredibly quickly as well. The eggs were a perfect over medium and the bacon was delicious. Some places undercook their bacon and it's chewy but the bacon here was crispy (not burned). All of the servers worked together so we had three different people give us drinks, take our order and refill our beverages. I thought that was great though and they really works as a team to make sure we were taken care of properly. I will definitely go back when I visit Peoria again soon!"}
{"text":"Very nice helpful waitress and staff . I took my family to eat here ; my wife and I liked it . tasty , big portions ."}
{"text":"My Friday Night Fish Fry to go place. The fish is beer battered and cooked right with huge servings. I opt for the fries which were nice and crisp bt a touch of salt after frying would bring out some flavor. The cole slaw lacks any flavor and is cabbage swimming in tasteless mayo, not very appetizing but the fish is the star and keeps me coming back almost every Friday. As busy as this place is the teamwork of the servers makes everyone feel at home and are very efficient. I highly recommend the Friday Night Fish Fry, just pass on the Cole Slaw."}
{"text":"We have been going there since 1999, and it's always been a positive experience. That Is, until today. We came in around 11 am, ordered eggs with gray and biscuits. We waited over 45 minutes at a time when the place was less than half full. Poor quality food and service. People sitting around us were getting their orders in drubs and drabs with people In groups watching the people with them eat while they were kept waiting for their food."}
{"text":"Extremely friendly but the old man at register is short and rude plus he doesn't fix mistakes in peoples food if they say it tasted outdated it wasnt eaten and we paid for it anyways ... whoever the old guy is is killing this spot for me the smaller lady is much more pleasant to deal with"}
{"text":"It's hard finding places like this on the west side. Actually I mean anywhere. A real mom and pop sort of place that might not be prom worthy but for a real breakfast that makes you feel like a real truck drivin', gun tootin' American.   Anyways, good prices and a damn good breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"The pinkish haired host told the 2 of us would have to wait for a table to get cleaned, though we saw booths set. But she went ahead and sat the group of 4 that came after us while we were still waiting. We left right after that ordeal - first impression ruined, not coming back."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Busy, and lots of hustle and bustle... really good food. This is the prototypical \"neighborhood joint\"."}
{"text":"Great family owned place. Have been coming here for 18 years. Food is good!!! Service even better."}
{"text":"Comfort food. Good comfort food. Good comfort food with a Southern flair. Breakfast anytime. Biscuits and gravy, Eggs cooked just right. Lots of choices. Spot-on friendly customer service. It was as if we stepped back in time . . . into a 1970s cafe. Our first visit was happenstance . . . a recommendation from a local person. . . . we definitely will be back the next time we are in this neck-of-the-woods. Might even be worth a special trip. Thanks Peoria Cafe."}
{"text":"The food here is always good and the service is great. It has certainly grown since the last time we were here some six years back. I only wish they had a larger hot sauce selection, all they had was some red sauce in a oil dispenser. The pancakes were big and tasted good, the turkey club was tasty. I didn't like the French fries so I'll make sure to ask for onion rings next time. And the sausage patties were kinda salty. Ultimately, this is a really nice place to come with friends or family."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot. Clean, cute and excellent, attentive service. The food was very good and the servings were super large. Can't wait to go back and try the fish fry on friday!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect. The waitresses are on queue. The food is more than I expected. Big portions and a wide variety. EVEN For those who are watching their calorie intake."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!  The service is amazing, the quanity for the quality is perfect and you can always count on leaving with a full tummy!  We are regulars every weekend!"}
{"text":"I came here around 12:30PM on Friday and it was just bustling!! I was actually surprised to see how busy it was when I walked in because you couldn't tell from the outside. Their demographic seemed to be 90% grandma and grandpas. I ordered my food to-go so I stood by the front door waiting, on my phone of course, and I thought to myself, \"they're probably all looking at me like those damn millennials and their phones.\" Sure enough, grandpa Bob walks by and asks, \"anything good on there?\" I felt like I was in trouble lol. It was funny.  Anywho.. I ordered a chef salad and have never been so impressed. Albeit it WAS around $11 bucks, it was delish!! Like I mentioned, I ordered it to-go and it was full to the max! I feel you get a little jipped with to-go orders usually, but that wasn't the case here. There was enough for two people really and all of the ingredients were so fresh! It came with turkey, ham (I didn't get this), cucumber, tomato, egg and cheese. I asked for ranch as my dressing and even that was fantastic!   The place was clean and the service was also great. The hostess was very friendly and had a cute little Latin accent. Me gusta!  I am honestly craving that salad! I have more work to get done on my car so I definitely know where I'm having lunch ;)"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch on a weekend! They have so much food to choose from.   The staff are always friendly, and the coffee is good. Stop by today for some great home cooked comfort food!"}
{"text":"Great clean coffee shop.  Prices good food very good service very good.  Burger may be the best in town, really.  Hand patted patties very good."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast place. The eggs and bacon were well prepared. The pancakes were golden. The service was good. The place is solid, but nothing special or mind blowing (in my opinion). Good, but not great."}
{"text":"Went on Father's day which appeared to be one of their busiest days ever. That didn't stop the staff from providing amazing customer service and delicious and hot food. The bus boys took drink orders and answered questions to help out, everyone was smiling through the madness and the manager was doing a fantastic job seating people as soon as possible. Can't wait to go back on a slower pace day as well."}
{"text":"I would not recommend eating at the Peoria Cafe. I ordered two pancakes and bacon for my breakfast. The bacon was nice and crispy like I ordered, however the pancakes were tasteless.   When I poured the syrup onto my plate from the container sitting on the table, to my surprise a large fly came out in the syrup! Disgusting! The rest of my friends refused to eat after seeing this. The waitress took the plate and the syrup from the table and apologized. We all left and will not be returning to the Peoria Cafe. The back door was open and there were also bugs flying around. I'm not sure if you can attach a picture to this, but I will if I can."}
{"text":"Best place to go for a quick meal with friendly staff.  My husband and I have been going here for about 3 years on a weekly basis.  We either try to stop in on Friday's for the Fish Fry (best in the Valley) or on Sunday for breakfast.  Either way, we walk out overstuffed because the food is so good, your mind has trouble telling your mouth to stop.  Amazing burgers and their breakfast food is way better than anything you would find at a chain restaurant.    The staff is always friendly and we never have empty glasses.  They are extremely prompt and the longest we have ever had to wait for our food was 7 minutes.  It is always reassuring to walk in there and recognize every face in the place.    I highly recommend Peoria Café!"}
{"text":"It's a good restaurant. The food here is pretty good and really cheap here. I had a big meal of hash browns, French toast, bacon, eggs, toast and coffee. Overall the food was excellent and delicious. The customer service is good and hope they keep that up."}
{"text":"Nice cafe. Service 5 stars, food 3 stars. I think my french toast came from the freezer. I'll try the pancakes next time."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices and great service... gotta come back for the fish fry friday..."}
{"text":"Just walked out. Came for breakfast. Sat down at counter. Usually the place for fast service. Waitress walked past me three times. No coffee. No greeting. After five minutes of being ignored, got up and left."}
{"text":"Basic breakfast you can get anywhere. They didn't serve real butter, the biscuits were dense, and coffee weak. Atmosphere is nice and staff was great. I will not be bookmarking this one though"}
{"text":"My mom wanted 'fish fry' for her birthday.  We're from the Lake Erie region and like a light, mild fish, lightly breaded.  I called around and found that Peoria Café had their fish fry Fridays.  The place was packed, but they sat us right away and were very efficient.  We weren't sure, after reading the reviews about how big the portions were, if we should order the fish dinner for $7.99 or the all you can eat (think it was $10.99).  The waitress said the $7.99 is a big portion, usually enough... so start with that, and if you want more, then I can bump you up to the all you can eat price.  Very nice that you don't have to start at the higher price only to later find out it was more than enough food... which it was!  The $7.99 meal is plenty!  The fish was very good.  Lightly breaded, not greasy, not fishy, light, flaky, meaty.  Very nice.  Comes with cole slaw (not the best ever, but definitely decent - we ate it all... it's a bit heavy on the mayo).  Also includes choice of potato - baked, fries or mashed.  Mashed may have been instant, it's been a while since we ate here, but I remember being unimpressed.  Again, not bad, certainly edible, but not 'blow you away.'  Fries were the same thing... so I've gotten the baked potato each time since.  It also comes with rolls, but sometimes when we go, we have to ask for them... they are happy to bring them when we ask.  The fish is why you should go and why you will more than likely return.  IT's very good at a great price.  The sides are fine.  The service has always been super friendly and it's definitely a 'neighborhood' place.  Everyone leaving on Friday night said 'see you tomorrow' - apparently they go there for breakfast too.  A lot of waitstaff called customers by name.  Cute."}
{"text":"Friendly service and great food for breakfast. This was our first time here and we will be back. Our waitress was so nice and friendly. The entire place makes you feel welcome."}
{"text":"Fairly tasty, very casual, friendly dining experience. Interestingly, one half of the dining area shares the floor space with the open floor kitchen and I was able to watch my food be prepared. Food was quite tasty. I had the french toast special. My over medium eggs were cooked perfectly, but the home-fries were slices of potatoes grilled on one side and reminded me more of hash-browns. In all fairness the waitress asked if I wanted them deep fried and I said no, but I guess that's how I have been getting them at other places and didn't realize it. Fyi they don't serve waffles, but I liked that their menu didn't have a million choices. Too many menu options is often the sign of desperation and bad food."}
{"text":"Prompt & friendly service, good prices, tasty food, everything I want in a little cafe. I had their croissant breakfast sandwich; loved it! If/When I'm back in the area, I'd like to try their bacon cheeseburger."}
{"text":"It's a nice place to go to for breakfast. My mom and I stopped here after I saw the reviews on yelp. The food was good with bug portions. The server was also nice, and the food wasn't that expensive. If I'm ever around this area I'll stop in again."}
{"text":"The food was horrendous and I rarely say that about a place. The potatoes were cold and undercooked and the sausage patty was like eating rubber and burnt on top. I got sick after eating here. On the positive side The cafe is cute and the servers were beyond fantastic. A little hard to find the place. Maybe it was just an off day for them? I will try again for lunch and update my review."}
{"text":"I have been here several times this visit was on a late Friday afternoon for the all-you-can-eat Fish Fry. We found the place packed with a crowd of mostly seniors and older adults. We were seated right away in the crowded dining room. (They have a nice patio for cooler weather dining) Our waitress took our drink order and told her we all wanted the fish. We all opted for the single order, single order is a few dollars less with more than enough food for even the biggest appetite. Orders arrived in about 10 minutes. Fish crispy and hot. Large pieces of Cod fish are dipped in a mild batter. This is probably some of the best fried fish around. Flaky, white flesh fried to a non-greasy goodness. Sides are run of the mill choice of potato, coleslaw and roll. Our older waitress was all about business. Efficient and thorough but wasn't into small talk.  If you are looking for ambience this isn't the place for you. It's old and dated. If you want good home cooked food or fish fry this is a perfect option in the North West valley."}
{"text":"Mash potatoes and gravy are nasty no flavor. Waitress only comes one time to table. Than bitch manager forces you to pay gratitude even though your waitress never comes back to ask if you need anything else.  Starts arguing with customers. Would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is your pretty typical greasy spoon place. It's usually pretty busy in the mornings (the only time I've been), but the service is fast. They have been here for a long time and seem to have a steady stream of regulars that come in.  The food is pretty standard breakfast foods, but always a good quick stop for a breakfast bite. They always have plenty of breakfast specials to choose from, and everything else to chose from is very reasonable.   If you are looking for a no frills, quick, reasonably priced breakfast,this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This is a local cafe and is pretty crowded on the weekend for breakfast.  It's what you want to look for when you're not from the area and want to have a good, authentic local dining experience.  The breakfast is relatively basic and the food pretty good.  The portions are quite large, perhaps to compensate for the quality and taste but overall it's a good value."}
