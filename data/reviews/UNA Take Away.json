{"text":"Love Una so naturally I enjoy their Take Out Market. Service isn't nearly as good as the restaurant side. Charged us for a product that they couldn't deliver on. No refund, but rather a credit. Seriously lame."}
{"text":"*****5 star customer service *****

On Saturday I ordered 3 pizzas from the online website via my iPhone.  Unbeknownst to me, I ordered it from the Saskatoon location instead of Calgary.  I would like to commend Una on their great customer service.  First someone from Saskatoon called to confirm the order was for Saskatoon and not Calgary (oops my bad).  Then the girl kindly put in the order for me at be correct location on a rush basis. 
Finally, they refunded my $ that I had paid for online.

I feel horrible for the mistake but applaud Una and their management for their integrity and the way they handled this mistake of mine.  

Pizza was delicious too (as always)."}
{"text":"I'm so happy this place is here!!!! The salads are SO GOOD (and now I can have my favourite Una kale Caesar salad anytime I want). The coffee is good too, and the service is always smiley. I tried the smoothie yesterday and it was delicious! So glad we have a place like this in Calgary!!"}
{"text":"This pizza was recommended, so I dropped by for a slice. Unfortunately, it was my greatest food disappointment in Calgary. Soggy, with hardly any taste, Una was not good pizza. Hopefully, Calgary has better."}
{"text":"I don't write reviews very often, but been meaning to write a review for ages for Una Takeaway.  We absolutely love Una and have been a fan for years and also picking up pies to-go in the restaurant side, but since Takeaway opened, I've been disappointed.

I'm definitely not imagining things, but the pizza is different on this side. We've received different quality pizzas on this side. The last two times we ordered, the oils seeped through the box while I was driving it home. I thought it could be a one time thing, but it happened again when I ordered the mushroom.  For the 4-maggi I can almost understand with the oils and honey, but to go through the bottom of the box is scary and reserved for the Pizza Huts and Domino's.

Another thing, the Kale Caesar is different! Our last order included two pizzas and a full size kale salad.  I was extremely disappointed to receive the kale caesar that they have on display behind the glass (which I thought was only for quick take-aways and lunch rush).  I didn't even get the boiled egg -  but crumbled bits of it within the salad!  I paid $16.00 for a scooped salad without the egg.  REALLY annoyed I didn't open it to check while I was there, or I'd have asked for a freshly made one. I get there's salad to scoop for lunch rush etc, etc, but not when it's pre-ordered and $16.00! That is bull-sh*t!  (NOTE: I was flicking through the pictures from other reviews, and it appears everyone else got the egg, maybe this is changed? Or I got someone who didn't know to put the order through the kitchen?!)

Last but not least, the chili oil.  For the years we've picked up on the restaurant side, I've always been given one chili oil per pizza purchased.  Well, when I came to pick up our pizzas, we asked for one per pizza as usual, and we were charged for both extras. I'm already spending over $45 and I have to pay another $3.00 two little sides of chili oil?!  Also, the side of chili oil is smaller at Takeaway. What gives? Charging a fee and cutting the size? Come on.

We will no longer order from Una Takeaway, which is a shame. However, we WILL order the occasional pizza from the restaurant side. We have learned to strategically order and pickup after 10 p.m. when we can get killer pizza and full size kale salads and a complimentary side of chili oil with no issues!

There's so much potential with Takeaway, but the quality control and service really needs to be equal to the restaurant for it to succeed. That is the reason why people fell in love with the restaurant in the first place."}
{"text":"UNA was recommended by our AirBnB host who claimed the Kale Caesar Salad was a local favorite! Surprising, right?

After many days of vacationing and heavy eating, a salad was unusually tantalizing - so we skipped the pizza and went straight for the kale!

The hype is real, people. The salad is huge, delicious, and full of different textures and tastes including egg, lemon, garlic panko, prosciutto and salt (maybe a little too much salt). With affordable prices, we added Focaccia and one Walnut Stuffed Persian Date to our order. So much for light and healthy... but man, was everything delicious.

I'm grateful UNA has this take away option so out-of-towners like myself can experience local flavor without spending too much precious vacation time indoors waiting for seating or a full service. Ordering online was super convenient and it wasn't hard to find free parking, even during the Calgary Stampede. 

UNA Take Away was just what we needed!"}
{"text":"What a great find! We grabbed some 'za to go (mine gf of course!!) and both pizzas were amazingly tasty! No joke, probably the best GF crust I've ever had! Thin, crisp, not crumbly or weirdo texture etc. And toppings were unique and awesome. It seemed a tad expensive until we realized it was 2 meals each per pizza. Perfect cap to expo day 3!!!!! #yycexpo2017"}
{"text":"I love this place even though I've not once actually got takeaway...there is ample seating inside and on a small patio so I've always dined in, and it's a fine experience, at least for dining solo. Sandwiches are on that incredible, toothsome house-baked bread and the harissa chicken is absolutely scrumptious. Lots of salad options; last visit I went for broke and got the large kale caesar. So, so good- nice balance of tender (not like chewing on wet paper as kale too often is) kale and lots of lovely bacon and hard-boiled egg and perfectly dressed, a salad you can really wrap your face around. Superb coffee program with Rosso beans. I've never had the pizza there but it's wonderful to have a by the slice option with product as good as this."}
{"text":"I love UNA but if I'm treating myself to a solo date I usually don't want to sit in a restaurant by myself. Stopped by the take-a-way on a sunny day and was  happy to see the lunch special of two slices of pizza and an Italian soda (San Pellegrino) for 10$ - by far one of the best priced lunches on 17th Ave! I had a slice of the Capricciosa and Margherita and had them on the patio. There isn't a tonne of selection - only three different flavours when I was there. They also have desserts available. The pizzas were nice and crisp, and it was nice to be able to take my food outside to the patio. Service was quick and a server even came outside halfway through my meal to make sure I was OK even though it was the take out side!"}
{"text":"Whilst on 17th Avenue SW, which I rarely get the pleasure of visiting, especially at lunch, I finally got to check out UNA Take away!  I was hoping for some pizza, but alas did they not have any of their by-the-slices available.  Better I get a salad anyways.  I ordered the large swiss chard salad, and I'm kind of left feeling bummed... and hungry.
The salad is dressed HEAVILY, like lump of swiss chard coated with goat cheese, a TON of craisins and almonds, I couldn't get through it.  And I think the worst part for me was it was $12.60 all together.  For me, take away should be reasonably priced.  an 8$ takeaway salad is reasonable, but $12?  It was so soggy.  The salad maybe could've been paired nicely as a side to something in small quantities, but they should offer I think more pre-made salads like cobb, or caesar with pre-packed side dressings.  This one was literally dressed to kill. 
Sorry UNA takeaway, your pizza is incredible, but your lunch time offerings are not."}
