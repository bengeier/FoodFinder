{"text":"Great food and real traditional open feel Mexican setting. Great place to stop by and enjoy great food that tastes authentic and is prepared just that way. Very simple place with a huge flavor!"}
{"text":"Pretty good taco stand. Especially yummy home-made tortillas. Big burritos, kind of greasy. Like Simon says, \"It's OK but rather forgettable.\" I think I need to work on my British accent."}
{"text":"This probably should be a 3.5 rather than a 4. I am currently on a tryst to find yummy offal tacos (like the street side food in Mexico) so I have been cruising the local offerings in Chandler.  After trying Mucho Taco and Taqueria Mi Casita ( which have a combination of lengua , Cabeza, tripha and Al pastor) I decided to give this place a shot.   This place is located on the south East corner of Alma and Ray. It is rather nondescript and thus very easy to miss. They have an attached bar with a pool table and apart for a few people playing there this place was dead.  I ordered their Lengua, Cabeza and al pastor taco. These all were rather tender and juicy. However the lengua didn't seem to have been processed well and I could see portions of papilla still lingering on. This all came with a free side of tortilla chips and fresh salsa (salsa tasted fresh and home made)  Most of the people only spoke spanish which woul dhave been a problem if it wasn't for the main owner who understood english perfectly and could speak well enough to get my order through.  The bar people were nice enough to allow me to play pool with them.  Overall a decent place to go to. The ambiance is rather old with a jukebox and garrish blue colors with fake pinatas hanging about. HAs a semi divey feel about it but the service was good and the food was decent."}
