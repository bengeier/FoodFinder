{"text":"Delivery is shameful from this place. Food comes without the accompanying sauce 50% of the time, and the meat dishes are padded with mushrooms to keep costs down. A request for no mushrooms due to an allergy in a dish led to to the same quantity of mushrooms as we've come to expect from Peking Dragon. The person who answered the phone when we called back cites \"busy, I forgot\" as an excuse. On a slow evening. Right.

This restaurant is lazy and sloppy at best when it comes to delivery. Delivery staff however is cheerful and nice, so this review presents no reflection on them.

It's a shame that the food is actually quite good. I wish I was more inclined to continue ordering from here."}
{"text":"Favourite Chinese restaurant in the city. I always order take out and delivery and they are fast. 

The black pepper beef, sweet and sour pork, beef hot pot, and green onion cakes are favorites.

I always see the same guy working at the front desk. He often recognizes me and make a point of saying hi. It's nice to know they appreciate repeat customers."}
{"text":"The decor of baby blue needs a revamp for sure but that aside, Peking Dragon is the solid Chinese restaurant every neighborhood needs. Friendly staff with discounts for take-out during Flames Games, it's a stronghold for something other than pizza slices and burgers in an area rife with such a menu."}
{"text":"Peking Dragon Restaurant is a great place for late-night food in uptown Calgary.  They have a huge take-out menu and are open until 2am on Fridays and Saturdays.  Last time I went we got a big container of rice noodles, sauteed veggies, and gluten-free ginger beef (made with corn starch -- yes!).  The owner gave us a table and tea while we waited which really wasn't too long.

There really isn't too many places to get great quality food in the early hours of the day but Peking Dragon is a really great place to get some! Next time you are hungry in the middle of the night, head over there or order from their delivery menu!"}
{"text":"I have to give Peking Dragon 5 stars because I don't normally go out of my way to eat Chinese food but the food at this restaurant is soooo good! We ordered in for Christmas Eve and all our guests raved about the dishes. Our favs were the palace style shrimp, lemon chicken and Singapore curry noodles. All dishes were of great quality. My in laws have eaten here forever and love it."}
{"text":"Looks quite old fashioned on the inside. The food itself was good. There are a few options for vegetarians, which is always great."}
{"text":"Calgary has a mysterious and depressing shortage of Chinese food restaurants. In most big cities, I'm used to finding one every few blocks within the downtown core, but Calgary is just full of western food and sushi restaurants. Nevertheless, I did find Peking Dragon and it wasn't too bad. I was craving Chinese food for myself but they didn't really have individual meals or portions, so I ended up ordering what I wanted... and it fed my fiance and I for 2 days. On the upside, the huge amount of food only came to $30 so it's definitely reasonably priced. Overall, it's not bad, but it's not great either."}
{"text":"Great food and super fast delivery. Very impressed. The food tastes fresh and it must be because no kidding it was only 25 minutes. The lady that delivered my food was patient with my barking but friendly dog. I won't order from anywhere else."}
{"text":"We ordered and the food came fast about 67 minutes. The food was awful. Our food was overcooked and the noodles were dry and looked like it was just taken out of the bag. The meat was slimy and fatty and didn't seem real at all I could barely swallow it. The dumplings in the won ton soup were soggy and seemed to come from a can. I'm not a picky eater and I never really have issue with places and if I do not really vocalize but this experience was bad enough I had to write especially after spending 40 dollars on a meal I only ate one quarter of.  Never order from this place"}
{"text":"I usually have good luck with Peking Dragon which is why I was really annoyed with my order last night. I ordered bbq pork fried rice, veggie shanghai noodles, ginger beef and an order of fried wontons. I was asked if I wanted wonton or wor-wonton soup and I don't like wonton soup at all, so I said again not soup but the appetizer. I was given the soup anyway and guess what - no wontons! I never ever send food back or complain but since I specified twice, I decided to this time. I was told she would give me a credit on the account since it wasn't \"worth it\" to send the driver with my correct order out. 

A few minutes later however, she called back and started implying it was me who ordered the wrong item and that \"we'd give you a credit if it was our mistake, but you know, we can't give you one for ordering the wrong thing.\" and also mentioned repeatedly how it was her brother who took my order and delivered it and he insisted I ordered soup. It's really too bad - the food is ok but I guess they don't want to make any money from my household. 

Oh - and one more thing... ginger beef is supposed to be BEEF. White meat (pork I think?) is NOT beef. Don't try and fool me, we live in Alberta!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is above average, really enjoyed there BBQ pork slices and there ginger beef. There service not so good always long wait and one time the owner told me I couldn't order a third beer so I never went back!"}
{"text":"Judging by the out dated decor, disgusting table tops, plastic chairs and 50 year old floor mats I can assure you the kitchen needs upgrading and has probably never been professionally cleaned.

I dropped in for Christmas Eve and I couldn't believe how rude the staff was. I politely asked if I could please make a basic substitution on one of their diner specials and I was told by the lady taking our order they usually charge 2$ for the request, but since they were so busy due to Christmas Eve they couldn't accommodate it and I would have to order the dish separately. She's one of the main servers / managers there, and every time Ive seen her she has been miserable. The tone of voice and body language were shockingly rude, and needless to say I told her I'd go elsewhere. 

Personally I prefer supporting happy, friendly, and respectful business owners. Even the main manager at the door and that takes orders by phone/walk-ins is miserable. Lighten up and perhaps treating your customers with a smile will come easier, since clearly you have no passion for your business."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's been a fav for the last 25 years and the quality never disappoints. Pork dumplings, curry beef, best ginger beef, palace style chicken, salt and pepper veggies. Friendly service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"they deliver as well; a bonus in this city of cold and snow"}
{"text":"We used to frequent PDR on 4th, sad to see that go but very happy with their new takeout/delivery place. Food and service remains unchanged and that's what matters most. Love the hot & sour soup and salt & pepper vegetables!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Toronto I stayed in the neighbourhood and decided to go to Peking Dragon Restaurant for dinner with the promise of good Cantonese food.  The place has been around since 1984 and still here, they must be doing something right.  The place is a throwback to the late 70s & 80s type Chinese restaurant, family run and every dish is made with pride...sometimes a little too much pride (more about that further into the review).

Tonight's meal consisted of the following:
1) Soup: 8 Jewel and Tofu:  Made to perfection, just like I have enjoyed in cities across the country at numerous restaurants.  It's kind of a staple for Chinese families to have this and similar variations with their meals at the start.

2) Yang Chow Fried Rice:  Again, tasty, fresh, hot and delicious.  Up at par with many good family style restaurants.

3) House Special Chow Mein:  Hot, fresh, tasty and yes delicious again.  The plate hit the target on authenticity and did not disappoint.

So why am I giving Peking Dragon 4 / 5 stars instead of the 5 / 5 stars they should have received from this review?

Owner / Chef pride, the inability to comprehend that customers pay for their fortunes, and from what I can see from some of the other reviews a lack of understanding of basic customer service.

As I sat down with my party I overheard the owner on the phone telling a customer that his meal was not cold that it was not possible.  There was more but I cannot be absolutely certain without hearing the other side of the conversation.  Well, that gentleman who called in is Simon C. who's review appears on the same date as this one.

Without seeing or tasting Simon C's food, I have to say that Chinese food is cooked in a wok at extreme high temperatures and will stay warm if not hot in those thermo containers...but stranger things have happened so benefit of the doubt.  Another complaint Simon C had in his review was that items were missing and tasted bland...fair enough.  This has also been a complaint of past clients on this restaurant's YELP page.

This restaurant's owner will have to come out of the 'old time' Chinese business behavior of doubting; if not accusing clients of being wrong or not able to order properly.  Times have changed, and no matter how good the food is, you will lose business over time until the doors close.  

To Simon C - It is unfortunate you had your situation today, and as a food lover and a stickler for good customer service I feel your pain.  That will make anybody take to the internet and spew venom in a hope to let others know.  I just want to let you know that although YELP-ers do place bad reviews from time to time we do not enjoy it.  We YELP because we love to talk about good news and positive reviews.  You have one (1) review and it is a big complaint, I hope you find plenty of opportunity to YELP about places that make you happy as well otherwise your one review will not mean much.

Peace.

Overall Review:  4/5
Food: 5/5
Customer Experience:  3/5 (for having to hear the phone call arguing from across the restaurant)"}
{"text":"I was astonished to find so many negative reviews on Peking Dragon's Yelp page. We LOVE them, and order from them at least once a week. The food arrives hot, the orders are complete, and the customer service is excellent. We have never had a bad meal from them, enjoying all the flavors and combinations. I would highly recommend Peking Dragon as a take out/delivery place."}
