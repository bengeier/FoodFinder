{"text":"Came in for a cold one on this record breaking heat day. The ambiance is great, well lit, live dj playing Cumbra and tejano music. There were the usual suspects. Old timers, a group of girls celebrating a 21st bday, some blue collar guys relaxing after work and me.  The place sure had changed from the old crossroad bar and I think for the better. As I lean on this bar, nursing my Budweiser watching these youngsters dancing and having fun, contrasted with the couple in their 60s just a couple dozen feet away it seems almost poetic.  It isn't, it's a Friday night.   Karaoke is back on after some celebrating of the 21 year old over the PA.  Good times."}
{"text":"What a shithole. Dirty and dingy, the food took forever and the fries were super greasy."}
{"text":"Well,,, yes it's more of a local bar with a pretend restaurant face. Hey, the people are great and the beer is cold. The food is a half step above Mc Donald's ... Maybe. I had the Oasis burger that comes with French Fry's - Don't do it. Not sure of the burgers true origin. The fry's came out of the fryer onto the plate, grease and all.  I was still so hungry at the time I consumed  the \"burger\" but only a few of the fry's that were on top of the pile that the grease drained out. Perhaps taco Tuesday will be better. Hope tomorrow morning doesn't have negative results. Still nice staff !!!"}
{"text":"A couple of TV's, a wanna be DJ playing songs then restarting the same song more than 3times then awkward silences then I see the bartender which is also the DJ rush to the laptop trying to put a song, changes his mind on the song.....worst than me in my car radio. Like the previous post the music is way too loud I mean seriously it's a joke their was only like 10people and everyone was focused on their tv. Oh the strobe lights are a bit too much came to watch game and every other second I was blinded.   Draft selection consisted of lightweight beers. 2 pool tables. I was debating food but I had my beer and left asap. I seen a couple people open the door walk in and out.... I should've done the same."}
{"text":"A bit of a dive bar. The waitress was friendly, but other staff were paying too much attention to some local guy. He was obnoxious. Food was edible. Felt fine the next morning. Some patrons need to be controlled and not urged on their bad and loud behavior."}
{"text":"The bar tender was nice enough but not familiar with some of the standard drinks. I asked her for one of her specialties then and it was over powering in the taste of alcohol and no real flavor I would ever chose to have."}
{"text":"Great bar food, friendly staff. Came down from Vegas to see a hockey game and stopped in because this place was across from our hotel. Small hole in the wall, but alcohol prices were amazing."}
{"text":"Not even sure where to start here... It's about 11:00 on a Saturday night and the only thing they are serving is chicken wings. I think that may have been because the server did not speak English... those may be the only two English words she knew.  Despite the language barrier, we managed to order. Not sure how with the band playing EXTREMELY LOUD Mexican music. I am of Hispanic heritage and, while I can appreciate the music, the volume of it was over the top.  We ate our wings as fast as we could and vibrated out the door back to our hotel. If we are ever in the area again we'll probably look elsewhere when we're looking for someplace to eat and/or drink."}
