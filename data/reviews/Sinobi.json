{"text":"The Asia Dogs are unique, and actually pretty good if you just want a light snack.  The sushi is ridiculously bad though.  Expensive, small, and not very good.  The rice is dry and lacks flavor.  Skip the sushi at all costs!"}
{"text":"The price was much too high for the quality and presentation. The staff was nice, but even for the convenience I can't justify the quality for the price."}
{"text":"I tried Sinobi sushi today for lunch located in Market Square, Pittsburgh. It was $5.89 for a California roll. It was fresh and tasty. The guy made it when I ordered it. They were very friendly. The ONLY thing that was off was the sushi was very small. I would have gotten two of them.
Very good taste though. Wish there was more avocado too."}
{"text":"For a sushi place, and their hot dogs r better than their sushi.. Sushi r small, poorly made and cost too much . I ordered the tijuana roll & they used chopped up tuna pieces that would be considered trimmed garbage that most sushi chef should toss out.. (large chunks of white unchewable pieces)"}
{"text":"always along wait for the sushi take out.   They have 2 sushi chefs and one woman taking orders.    there were only 3 or 4 people in front of me and it took at least 20 min of waiting for my california roll and tuna roll.   And while I was waiting - someone else came in to order and the woman behind the counter says it will be about 30  min before i can take any orders again because the chefs are almost out of rice and we have to make more.   And I am thinking - why can't you make rice lady?   So i finally get my rolls and it was evident they were stretching their remaining rice as my rolls have very little rice around them.   

I always have to ask for extra soy sauce packets - and i get 2.. I don't understand why you just can't have a basket with that out for the customers to take what they need - the 4 packets (2 comes with it and I asked for more - got 2) barely made it.. 

They apparently offer a loyalty card - but they aren't sitting out.. you have to ask and and lady (who can't make rice and take orders at the same time) acts like she is completely put out by having to get a card for you.   

I think this take out sushi is a great concept - but it needs some major overhaul.  They apparently need more employees.. someone that can take orders and make rice.. and perhaps that the lunch hours say 11-2 they need a 3rd chef so there isn't such a back log.   And they need to pre make some basic rolls like california, tuna etc and put them in their cooler for grab and go.  I understand you don't want to make too many and have to toss it as it doesn't keep..   But you could start out with some for the peak lunch rush."}
{"text":"I waited at least 20 minutes for the most flavor-free Philly roll ever created. The place was not busy at all. The employees seemed to be rushing...to make one plate at a time.  The dine-in plates were poorly presented, nothing seemed very fresh, and my take out would have been faster & better from Giant Eagle. 
Don't waste your lunch break or your money."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place as part of my quest to find the best sushi joint in Pittsburgh, and I've gotta say, even for the 'Burgh, this place doesn't stack up.

I ordered a rainbow roll (spicy), which wasn't terrible but was smothered in so much sauce I could barely taste the fish. Not subtle at all. In terms of presentation, the roll was pretty sloppily prepared. I washed it down with a \"Milkis\" milk soda, which was oddly tasty.

In terms of ambience, it's clean, well lit, and not dealing drugs, so everything you'd expect from a good to-go Market Square establishment. Not a lot of seating, but Market Square has plenty of outdoor seating available most days.

Overall, not awful and very convenient, but I'm more likely to make the trek up to Sushi and Rolls at Oxford Center or Penn Ave Fish Co. for my sushi fix."}
{"text":"Conceptually you would think this place would be a hit! I mean sushi is hot right now. But the actually place has much more to be desired. First of all the menu is lackluster. I mean its a sushi place with barely any sushi! I could make better sushi at home and I have trouble not messing up a bowl of cereal! I bought a fancy sushi which i think was a rainbow roll and a regular spicy tuna. Neither was anything to shout about. I also got a side of seaweed salad which probably was the best part and I got a can of pop. Total bill: $19 with tax. I almost fell off my seat. But oh well. 

If they want to make this competitive they need to take off the stupid hot dogs off the menu - its a sushi place. If I want a hot dog Ill go to franctuary. Two they should put pictures up of all the sushi variations they make and increase the variations and come up with unique concepts like a yinzer roll. Three they need to make lunch specials - 1 order of sushi and drink for $5.99 2 orders of sushi and a sushi and a drink for $10.99. something like that. And finally, they need to walk into penn ave sushi and realize that's your competition. Time to step up your game.

Wouldn't be surprised if this place goes out of business soon."}
{"text":"Sorry Sinobi. For awhile I could put up with the not-so-special sushi in lieu of the far superior offerings at Penn Ave Fish Company --the only other sushi place that I know of near my place of work downtown. But the meager, sad looking \"rainbow roll\" with teeny-tiny strips of nothing looks like fish bait. Never again will I fork over my money for something I could get at a convenience store. Owners: Please take the time to  read these reviews and put out quality sushi! It would be great to have more sushi options near market square. $13 bucks later and my stomach is still grumbling..."}
{"text":"Working downtown I always run out of dining options. You can only have so many subs or slices of pizza in any period of time before you lose the taste for it.

I ran into Sinobi on their opening day and I was super excited about this. Who doesn't love sushi? Well, I mean some people don't like it, but I love it. What a great lunch idea I thought. Sushi is light enough to tide you over from lunch until dinner. You're not overly full, but you're satisfied until the next meal.

Sinobi in theory is great. It's a take out sushi (bar?). I took a look at the menu and wondered where the choices where. There were only about 6 options of sushi, a few salads and beverage options. I tried to keep it simple since I didn't know what to expect so I just got a California roll, which I will say was good, but I thought it was kind of pricey for the size of the roll. I paid $6 for the roll, which you normally can get  for $4.99 at Giant Eagle and they taste pretty much the same.

I mean. I hate to say I won't go back, but I definitely won't rush back. If I'm really craving sushi I'll go because it's so convenient, but I would not recommend it to anyone because there are definitely better options downtown."}
{"text":"The food is ok but it is definitely pricey. You will be still hungry after spending $10."}
{"text":"Review based on 1 Lunch Visit. 

Ordered two of the \"Asia Dogs\" 2 specialty hot dogs for $4.00 

1. Bulgogi Festival - All beef hot dog on bun, topped with Korean BBQ and Choped Kimchi.  Sauce: Chungyang Chili

2. Chicken Karate - All beef hot dog on bun, topped with Korean Style Chicken Salad, and Chopped Kimchi. Sauce: Chungyang Chili

Choice of Sauces: Chungyang Chili, Zinger, Orange Mayo, & Teriyaki. 

The two hot dogs were very good. Taste was excellent, only took about 5 minutes to get my order, and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Sushi to go in downtown: amazing concept!

In reality....the sushi tastes like...to go sushi.  You know, the kind you get at Giant Eagle, Whole Foods or other grocery stores.  Except way less options and more expensive.  

If I was working downtown and I was craving sushi hardcore, would I buy it from here? Maybe if I didn't have time to stop in at Penn Ave Fish Co and I was in dire need of a sushi fix.  Okay, let's face it.  I probably wouldn't.  Skip it and head to Penn Ave.  There's always time for good sushi!"}
