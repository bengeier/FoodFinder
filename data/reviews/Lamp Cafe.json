{"text":"11/21/17 we went to Lamp Caffe as Lamp Pizza was a 45 minute wait.  At 6:30 on a Tues evening cafe was mostly empty.  We ordered 2 pasta dishes, 1 pizza, 1 Caesar salad and 1 entree salad.  As tables filled up around us, they received their food before we did.  Upon asking our waitress where our food was, the answer was \"I'll check on it\" but with no answer.  Some food finally arrived after an interminable time.  Caesar salad never arrived.  Pizza was so overlooked it was inedible, 1 pasta dish arrived at no better than room temperature and was sent back.  We asked for bread & butter- it never arrived.  Most of the surrounding tables were served and left before we received our meals.  Manager never came over.  Lamp Pizza owners should shut this satellite down before it adversely affects their reputation.  First and last time for us at Lamp Cafe.  Neither the service nor the food could even be considered acceptable.  If there was a no star rating, that is what we would rate the cafe at.  Never Again!"}
{"text":"This is a cozy neighborhood place, located just across from Lampe Pizzeria. Salads at lunch are just right and service both inside and on the patio is very good. I thought that the Mignulatas  were really tasty accompanied by a side salad. For the plain eaters out there, turkey sandwich was really good as far as my one bite went. Thanks for this casual sandwich salad stop!"}
{"text":"Stay AWAY from Lamp cafe at LaMirada!  High prices, poor quality!!

Chopped salad w/more lettuce than anything else.  The chicken was the size of two chicken tenders and not grilled.  Looked forward to the Nutella dessert.  Absolutely no flavor there, just an icky cheesecake excuse.  Those positive reviews are Lamp cafe employees/friends.  We'll see how long the cafe lasts. My husband &I won't be back.  My friends & neighbors will know why!"}
{"text":"Loved the deep dish pizza! Just wish there were size options. Service was very good. Also had great happy hour drink prices."}
{"text":"Tried to dine there At 7:30 on a Friday evening. After being seated and ordering a glass of wine, we were informed that they \"were out of pizza dough.\" Five minutes later we were told that we could not order any sandwiches because they were out of bread. There are many dining options within 5 minutes of this restaurant. Obviously we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had the sun dried tomato and goat cheese pasta on 8/16/17. Food was good but I won't go back because I noticed one of the kitchen workers (an overweight young female) did not wash her hands after using the toilet. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Left Tomasas, left lamp pizzeria. Lamp cafe best food..if you are not here you are missing out! Have the goat cheese marina appetizer."}
{"text":"I was working out at the gym next door and needed some food fast, so I came here to grab a bite. Upon entering I was welcomed by Vinnie, the manager, and he immediately offered me a seat and made me feel at home. It is rare I have come across customer service that goes above and beyond all expectations so I wanted to make sure and give a personal thank you to Vinnie for doing this. Not only was I blown away by the fast service but the food was also AMAZING!! The house salad was incredible and the GLUTEN free turkey  Callahan sandwich was smoked so that it melted in my mouth. Lindsey , the owner even came by to see if my food was made to perfection....yes!! I will be back here again and again to try all their different options! Wow."}
{"text":"I'm so excited to have a gourmet lunch option up north!!! The portions are great, and the ingredient even better. There are several great options depending on your preferences. Soups, salads and sandwiches. For carnivores, vegetarians and even showing love to those who don't eat gluten. My husband ordered the frank and I ordered the meatball sandwich. We shared both and they were both delicious. I got a side of barley and feta salad, which was fantastic. I could have eaten a tub of it. We also shared a cannoli which was huge and delicious. Excited to try their salads and soups next."}
{"text":"Had a very pleasant lunch there yesterday. I ordered a salad and added chicken to it. The chicken was exceptionally well done. It was moist and added to the salad.  The greens tasted fresh. I had the dressing on the side as this allowed me to control the amazing on the salad. 

I would offer the suggestion of adding more potatoes and green beans to the salad. While  it was a fresh bowl of greens it was a little bit of a treasure hunt to find the salad inclusions"}
{"text":"This is the much less busy but equally amazing lamp establishment.   They have pasta, pizza, sandwiches, and various appetizers.   Their pizza is a thicker Sicilian crust that is excellent.   The meatball appetizer was great per my boyfriend who wouldn't share.   If you can't get into lamp pizza I'd definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for food to go. I ordered two salads and sat at the bar while I waited. The bartender seemed crazy busy, doing a little bit of everything - as they usually do. He walked up to me about three times attempting to get my order and as soon as I started talking he walked away to do something else. I'm not a huge fan of that. Once he realized I was to go, I was off of his radar, despite the glass of wine that I ordered. My food came out fast. It was decent. I'd like to go back and try the pizza, it looked yummy coming out for everyone else that ordered it. Perhaps I should have gone with the pizza, but for now I'm at 3 stars, mostly because of the service I had."}
{"text":"This is the expansion of lamp pizza which is right across the sidewalk. The food is Italian, but they do not serve pizza. The menu is sandwiches and salads. Today was the first day they opened so I understand that things were not as good as they will be. Overall, it was good but not great. I think it could be great with some tweaks and I hope they will adjust the flavors a bit. 

They have sandwiches much like pane bianco, but not as good as Pane Bianco or Noble Eatery. First the regular sandwich bread is quite hard and difficult to chew through. It is a flatbread like PB and NB, but lacks their softer bread chew that I feel is better. They do have a gluten free bread which my wife tried and I have to admit, because it was easier to get through, and was a bit more flavorful, I actually preferred it and will probably order this next time. 

Overall both the sandwiches were a bit bland and one dimensional.The problem seems to bee that bread is overpowering the flavor of the insides. I suggest they try Pane Bianco's or Nobel Bakery's sandwiches to see that something similar can be extremely tasty. Maybe a bit more aioli or some mustard offerings to punch up the flavor. 

They also have salads which look very good and I am sure they are as good as the lamp pizza ones we like. 

There were the odd issues with things since it was their first day. All were taken care of immediately and efficiently. 

Service was 5/5. We will be back and I will update my review at that time.

Update:

My wife and I have have been here 3 more times since they opened. The bread is better, but it is still getting in the way of enjoying the sandwich. I suggest you ask them to warm the sandwich if you find the bread a bit tough like we do. This makes for a better experience IMO. The flavors are improved.  Overall I feel it is much better and I give it a 5/5 overall now."}
{"text":"Lamp Cafe is a small restaurant with a patio that offers a full bar, appetizers, soup, salad, and Italian/Sicilian Style Sandwiches. The dining room is very neat looking and the chairs are comfortable.

We were greeted quickly on arrival and were seated promptly.

When I looked at the menu we had to ask about the Mignulatas because I never heard of a Mignulata before. It's a Sicilian rolled bread that's stuffed and they serve it in three slices as a platter. It's very similar to more well known Sicilian Scaccia (lasagna) Bread. As interesting as Mignulatas sound we both went with the Fofo Sandwich Platter.

The Fofo Sandwich can be made with house made Sicilian Style Sausage or Vegetarian with Zucchini Cakes. (we got one of each) They serve these sandwiches on freshly made bread that looks similar to ciabatta but taste more like focaccia bread with that delicious lacing of olive oil. The ingredients in the sandwich are \"NUCLEAR BLASTS\" of flavors in your mouth from Sweet Roasted Red Peppers, Spicy Pickled Vegetables, Peppery Wild Arugula, and that Sharp Provolone adds that perfect balance between all the bold flavors. This sandwich was just delicious. The party isn't over yet. The sandwich comes with your choice of side and we picked the barley salad and the bean salad. Both were tasty and delicious and lastly to top it off there is a little treat of a goat cheese stuffed pepadew pepper.

The Fofo Sandwich platter couldn't be any better and the service couldn't be any nicer.

The Fofo Sandwich truly was among the best tasting sandwiches that I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Finally a great spot for lunch with friends with delicious food and prompt delightful service."}
{"text":"The service and food were amazing.  The appetizer Chopped Pesto with bread was wonderful!!!!
They were very accommodating and friendly.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"OUTSTANDING!!!
Lamp Café is the perfect compliment to their Pizzeria next door... A group of three of us went there the other night because we love finding locally owned businesses to support...
The Mignulata appetizer is so unique and so good we could have just ordered a bunch of those for our meals and been happy... But we're so happy we didn't stop there!  We decided we should each get a different sandwich and share with each other so we could get a feel for a variety of items:

Most Unique:  \"PLT\" is a fun spin on the classic BLT - but substitute delicious pepperoni and some Italian flavors to make this a tasty treat!

Most Interesting:  \"Angelina\" turns zucchini cakes into an awesome sandwich.  First of all, the zucchini cakes were some of the best we've ever had - and then to enjoy them inside a sandwich was fantastic!

Most Amazing:  \"Meyer\" was the BEST meatball sandwich any of us had ever had!  I don't know how they make their meatballs at Lamp but they are out of this world!  Then combine them with the provolone and the house-made break and it was off the charts!

WE WILL DEFINITELY GO BACK!!!  Strongly recommend Lamp Café to anyone!

PS:  Super friendly staff, very clean, and a relaxed vibe put this place over the top :)"}
{"text":"I've been to lamp pizzeria before but yesterday was my first time trying the new cafe. I gotta say..I think I like it more than I like the pizzeria! 
It's pretty small in there but was not busy when we went. It's got a cute rustic feel, I love the little bar area! For an appetizer I insisted we order the rough pesto with bread and boy I'm sure glad I did. It doesn't look like regular pesto so we were uncertain..but ended up loving it! It tastes really fresh, and the bread was grilled and delicious! 
For my meal I ordered the eggplant Parmesan sandwich, and chose the feta barley salad as my side. I also saw they had sandwiches that had zucchini cakes which I would like to try another time. The sandwich was delicious, was not too dry but not too soggy. Bread was perfectly crispy and the eggplant was yummy! The feta barley salad was cold and refreshing, I'm glad I tried it. Everything was totally delicious I am definitely coming back. Good service too!"}
{"text":"This is the best little Italian cafe for lunch! It is right next door to Lamp Pizzeria, where we have always enjoyed their Fire Grilled pizza and salads. We were pleasantly surprised with the variety of salads, soups, and sandwiches. My husband ordered the Frank sandwich with chef salad. Generous portion of meats and cheeses between crusty bagget! Delicious! I ordered the minigulata which came with 3 choices and a barley salad. We topped that off with cannoli to take home for desert. Sitting outside was refreshing and Lindsey and her stafg couldn't have neen nicer. we would certainly recommend this restaurant to any one who enjoys delicious food at a reasonable price!!! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The Kid had a performance at a nearby church so The Hubby and I wanted to grab a bite before the show. Originally went to Lamp Pizza but all they had was outside seats. They suggested Lamp Cafe, right next door. We made happy hour by 10 minutes and I was excited to learn they had Huss brews on tap. We shared the goat cheese marinara dip which we both agreed we could eat with a spoon. Mmmm. The Hubby had the meatball sandwich and I had the Meyer (grilled meatballs with olive salad and cheese). I loved my sandwich and Hubby loved his. Each sandwich was $12 and a good size. We both brought half home and had it for lunch the next day. The service was prompt and friendly, the atmosphere was chill (Beatles music played and workers be bopped along). It was a lucky find. I'd recommend this place to anyone in this part of town."}
{"text":"Noticed that Lamp Cafe had recently opened not too far from home. Then in my Facebook feed a New Times story popped up that it was REALLY worth the drive to North Scottsdale for Lamp Cafe's Italian Sandwiches. Lucky for us we live nearby so the drive was only about 10 minutes. No matter how far you are away, New Times was spot on, the sandwiches are amazing!"}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, and great service (in no particular order). A visit to LAMP Cafe is a must. We started with the Mignulata (Sicilian stuffed bread) and tried one of each. This is how I would recommend sampling this dish! Then I enjoyed the PLT with the Simple Salad. My husband enjoyed the Eggplant Parm sandwich with the Barley Feta Salad. Our son loved the kids Penne with Red Sauce. We are looking forward to coming back and trying some of the other amazing dishes. Thanks LAMP Cafe! Family night or date night, we enjoyed a great night out. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Pit fragments in the olive tapenade. Hair in my bean salad. \"Pesto\" was not even close and tasted too salty and gross. Thought pesto was supposed to have basil in it??? Lamp kitchen is great but the cafe, forget it."}
{"text":"We are repeat customers.  The food is always fresh and delicious. I love the fact that the menu has salads and sandwiches that are different than other restaurants. The owner and staff are always friendly and efficient. We love the sister Lamp Pizzaria next store. It's hard to get a good wood burning pizza to compare to what I am used to from NY/NJ. I have tried most items on the menu and have not been disappointed with anything."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I are both big fans of Lamp Pizzeria, so we automatically had high expectations going into Lamp Café.

Yes, they still serve pizza here, although it's Sicilian style, so it's not quite a duplicate of what their pizzeria offers. Their main emphasis, however, is on their pastas and sandwiches. You will find some familiar items available, such as their mignulata (stuffed bread), as well as new adventures, such as their excellent penne rosa pasta.

The mignulata here is a bit more creative. You have three options as opposed to the single cauliflower/sausage option next door. You can also order a peas/sausage or speck/sausage. Since they are much smaller here, you have the option to order all three with the addition of a side salad. All are excellent, although almost too similar to each other in some ways.

For pasta, we ordered the penne rosa, which includes sundried tomatoes, cream sauce, and goat cheese. Additionally, we tried the classic pasta, which consists of rigatoni with homemade tomato sauce and your choice of either meatballs or sausage (we chose balls).

Overall, the pasta quality here is top notch, although we were particularly more drawn towards the penne due to its creamy flavor. But honestly, it's mostly about preference. We were quite pleased with the food and I have a feeling that their other pastas offer similar results.

For dessert, we ordered their peanut butter and Nutella pie, which was just okay. I'd classify it as 95% peanut butter with 5% Nutella with a texture similar to flourless chocolate cake. While not bad, it was a bit dull and not something we would order again. If you really want a treat, I suggest getting their amazing gelato, which is also served next door.

Most places that serve pasta at this level are not located anywhere near Lamp. The food is excellent, server was polite, and prices were appropriate with the amount of food you get.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place has my heart! I have a thing for local, intimate family run spots, and this place is just that. 

I've been to Lamp Cafe several times and have never been disappointed. Some of my favorite dishes are listed below:

Rough Chop Pesto & Bread - I could eat this pesto with every meal for the rest of my life, I'm that in love with it. And THAT bread. Made fresh in house daily. It doesn't get better than that! 

Roasted Mushroom Barley Soup - I wanted a lighter meal one night and ordered this soup alongside a salad. There is so much savory flavor to it, I couldn't get enough. I actually dream about it to this day. 

Mignulata - All flavors are delicious, but the Classic stands out to me. The concoction of all those ingredients make a mighty tasty starter to any meal. 

Sicilian Pizza - You have the option of creating your own, or selecting from predetermined combinations. The Spicy Sauce & Pepperoni is outstanding, but be warned, the spicy sauce is SPICY. If your palate can't handle it, you can always sub the regular sauce. 

Penne Rosa Pasta - When I want comfort food, I default to this simplistic, yet utterly flavorful dish. It's not overly sauced, so the balance is perfect, in my opinion. My husband and I will sometimes get an order of the Penne Rosa and one of the salads for dinner, a bottle of their wine or cocktails (they have a fantastic selection), and gelato to finish off! 

Everyone at Lamp Cafe is incredibly nice and accommodating, and I always feel well taken care of every time we come in for a meal. If you haven't been recently, the space underwent a small remodel and is cuter than ever! It's super chic without being stuffy.

This spot will continue to be in my rotation of restaurants that I visit often. I love it too much for it not to be."}
{"text":"When I first heard Lamp Pizzeria was opening Lamp Cafe right across the walkway, I was excited to see what they would bring to the new venture. Given the quality food and great service at the pizzeria, my expectations were very high. 
I gave them a couple weeks to work through the opening issues that every restaurant is bound to have and went for lunch today. Everything was fantastic! The crostini with marinara and goat cheese dip was terrific. The goat cheese was creamy and added the perfect flavor to the marinara. 
The mignulata was amazing. I'm not sure I could chooses which of the three I liked best, as they were all terrific. 
I can't wait to go back and and try the sandwiches which looked great when they were being served to other tables."}
{"text":"The company that owns Lamp Pizza did a smart thing opening another restaurant right next to their pizza place.  This one, Lamp Cafe, uses most of the same ingredients as the pizza and simply packages them as sandwiches.  The pizza toppings double as sandwich fillings.  Of course that is an over-simplification, but I thought it was brilliant.  The only problem is, the sandwiches aren't that good.  

The pizza dough bread is chewy and thick - perhaps a panini format would be better.  We tried two sandwiches - sliced meatball and eggplant parm.  Both were okay but not memorable.  The accompanying barley feta salad was okay too but no more.

The restaurant is clean and well-lit, but not fancy in any way.  The prices are average.  Lamp Cafe is just another sandwich shop with pizza-like sandwiches.  I'm not really disappointed, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"First check in was yesterday.  As previous reviews stated, the place was not busy- maybe four tables occupied at lunch time.  Our server seemed attentive at first, providing menus and our beverages. I explained that it was our first time and we needed just a few more minutes to decide.  Artisan foods are to picky teenagers, as spikes are to cactus.  We ordered sandwiches: the meatball & the Callahan. Food was very good and tasted fresh.  Sandwiches came with a side salad, we chose the barley and the spicy bean for a variety.  Both had lots of celery; sizes were based upon the sizes of the salad contents.  I'm not a fan of celery and the amount was a turn off for me.  The service declined a bit after out food was delivered.  Our server seemed to be more interested in speaking with a group of people sitting at a hightop table with what appeared to be a chef or bartender. Disappointing because the meatball was messy- good, but messy- and I kept licking my fingers.  Extra napkins would have been great with our food.  The portion sizes were decent and filling for moderate appetites.  Hungry girls could always find room for dessert.  We tried, but couldn't do it.  Ended up taking home half of both sandwiches and the celery salads.  Overall, food was good and fresh, but service was just ok."}
{"text":"This place has THE BEST salads and sandwiches. One order can feed you for lunch and dinner. Full bar available (unlike Lamp) so you can grab a beverage here before going next door for pizza or just enjoy salads and sandwiches here. Bar seating and formal sit down. Can't say enough how good the food is - yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Some really good things here, BUT! First, I know they play business Pandora; just please not so loud. Second, no anchovies. Seriously, how can you claim Italian roots and not offer anchovies? So, I went with salami on my Caesar salad; quite good. The olive plate was strange, but kudos for the tapanad. Back to the salad; good parmesan, but crotons are supposed to add crunch. The eggplant parm was decent but didn't speak of Italy. Oh, the relatively stark ambiance is fine. The staff were adequate. Not a place to which I'd bother returning but I wouldn't refuse."}
{"text":"Just as good as lamp pizza. Great option for lunch and dinner. Mignulatas are unique and quite tasty. Pastas are amazing. Same simple salad from next door. Peanut butter Nutella pie is a must. Lamp pizza and Lamp cafe are as close to Italy as you're going to get without crossing the pond. A++"}
{"text":"I ventured into Lamp Cafe not even knowing they would be open today...but they were to my delight. The staff was very warm, kind and welcoming and I chose to sit outside on another beautiful Arizona day.

George was my server and he was very kind and efficient. I ordered the Lillian sandwich which I liked very much and which had roasted peppers, prosciutto and arugula. I chose a simple salad as my side and and loved how light it was with the dressing.

The portions are generous and the prices are in line with the high quality of the food. Highly recommend Lamp Cafe and wishing them much success. Also kudos to Carl, Vinnie and Jeff for their outstanding service."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! We had an eggplant Parmesan sandwich and a turkey sandwich and there is just something special about every dish at LAMP. I highly recommend this restaurant and the LAMP pizzeria right nextdii"}
{"text":"I was surprised this place wasn't as crowded as next door's Lamp Pizzeria as the food is amazing and service impeccable. We were there on a Saturday night with reservation but looks like we could've just walked in. 
We ordered chopped salad to share and pasta with meatballs and Angelina (zucchini cake sandwich). The pasta (rigatoni) was really good and the meatballs were one of the best I've had. I wish they had spaghetti (instead of rigatoni) to go with this dish; I think it would've made the dish even better. The server said they may have it in the future. The zucchini cakes in my sandwich was very interesting. It had lot of flavor which is difficult to do with a vegetable. It came with a thick piece of mozzarella and generous smear of dressing. The bread in the sandwich, salad and pasta was good too. Crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle.
The table next to us ordered a pizza. I thought it was little pricy for pizza but it actually turned out to be a good value. The size is big enough to feed 3 adults. We will try that next time."}
{"text":"So......  I had looked up pizza places and Lamp
Popped up.  Said wood fired which we love so we went.  Well.....  I didn't realize there was Lamp Cafe and Lamp Pizzeria.   Being from out of town just saw LAMP.  So disappointed in one sense as I didn't get what I wanted but what we had was good.  Lamp Cafe only has Sicilian pizza.  I asked about it. You would have thought they might have said oh across from here is our pizzeria that has the other style.  My bad I guess for not noticing that there were two restaurants named Lamp near one another.   I had even shown our waiter a picture from the Yelp of the pizzeria.    He didn't say anything.   Oh well.  I hate learning the hard way"}
