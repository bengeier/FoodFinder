{"text":"This restaurent offers an interesting dining experience formal and informal at the same time. The place is spacious yet cozy. The movable tables are fun and convenient. The food is pretty tasty, especially the appetizers, and very specifically, the calamari dish is my favorite. It is suitable for romantics dates as well as group dinners. It has the open kitchen concept, which is pretty cool. 

The only negatives are that it does not take any reservations and the main dishes are so-so (the taste is good, but not too much variety). Appies are great, so I would get a few and share - tapas style."}

{"text":"My cousin and I try to venture out and try a new \"cool\" restaurant in Calgary everytime I am in town as I am from Edmonton...and Model Milk is definitely one of my favourites! From atmosphere to service, this place has it all for a laid-back dining experience. I especially enjoyed the 2 level open-concept as well as the ambiance created from the unique lighting.

We ordered the large format fish tacos which consisted of a WHOLE roasted fish, pico de gallo, pickled cucumber, chili peanut slaw, avocado & hot sauce. Absolutely DELISH! The fish was cooked perfectly. 

Will definitely be back here again soon. =)"}
{"text":"I came expecting to love love love this place.  I didn't.  *sad face*

As one of enroute's top picks for Canada 2012, my expectations for this place were very high.  Sometimes reputations exceed experiences.  We came midweek and had no trouble getting a table without a reservation (they do take reservations apparently, despite their website indication).

We stuck to the small plates menu to maximize our experience: 

FRICASSEE OF CALAMARI Guanciale, Edamame, Pimenton.  Impression:  interesting Ingredients, looked like an Italian pasta dish and didn't impress taste wise, not bad, but nothing to go out of your way for.

FOIE GRAS PARFAIT Blackberry Coulis, Crostini.  This was good.  Yes I'd order it again.

OCTOPUS Bone Marrow Vinaigrette, Parsley Coulis.  This was disappointing.  Overly chewy, and while this is often the case with octopus, I have had it tender (although for that preparation was pickled, and maybe that is what is necessary for tender octopus).  I wanted to like this more.

COUNTRY FRIED SWEETBREADS Hot Sauce, Roasted Buttermilk Emulsion, Celery Salad.  This was good, nice texture and the flavors were like Frank's hot sauce tamed with buttermilk,  a sophisticated hot wing.

We also had spring rolls which are not on the website menu.  The server highly recommended these, and I'm glad we included them in our meal.

The wine selection was reasonably good, and the sommelier was available for questions or suggestions.  It is worth a second trip before making a final rating, but there are so many places to try and not enough opportunities."}
{"text":"I was blown away the first time I ate here, but am a bit more reserved after the second.

The fried chicken and waffles for two is indeed amazing. The atmosphere is good, and I love some of the bar snacks, particularly the roasted shishito peppers, which taste like a light version of delicious salty-sweet-spicy-greasy Chinese food.

After trying the chicken and waffles I was expecting the rest of the menu to be more simple and down-to-earth. To me, that dish goes for harmony in flavours rather than novelty. But I think it's a novelty compared to the rest of the menu. My friends and I ordered a stack of small plates, and all I remember is a blur of strange, creamy gnocchi, smears of hazelnut puree, drips of sauces and probably the least southern tasting shrimp and grits I've ever had. They were like mini entrees (perhaps 2/3rd size) rather than dishes to combine and share.

I wanted to give 4 stars based on my first visit, but I also don't really want to go back."}
{"text":"Very slow service on a Monday night.  Stampede week - no surprise that it might be busier?  +90 mins and still waiting on entrees...."}
{"text":"Milk Does A Body Good - Had really good friends (Marychino & Choocho) in from Iowa, and friends (Freon & Hot Choklit) from Okotoks, can't remember which is farther south, and we all went Milk. It was the Friday prior to Christmas, so a table for 6 was easier to attain than usual. The feel of the room in the former Palm Dairy and Victoria's location was comfy and austere. The beet salad was a nice fusion of greens (& beet red) w/creamy dressing. The special that eve, Duck,  was nice; the meat was not as tender as hoped, but moist and not overdone. Other members of the table, including The Princess Bride, enjoyed their choices, which ranged from chicken to calamari to steak. When looking to eat Uptown 17, \"Got Milk?\""}
{"text":"We had my sisters wedding rehearsal dinner here and they were so accommodation. Everything tasted wonderful and all of the out of towners were super impressed. Such a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"Dear friends, 
FRIDAY FEB 13 TH we were celebrating 3 birthdays for a group of 7 ladies. We came in from out of town and made the reservation months ago. We were 5 minutes early but still managed to wait on the stairs (parched) for 20 minutes. The decor was awesome but the place was filled with bearded hipster yuppies that thought they were at Nobu in L.A. Things started to go south as soon as we were seated. Our waitress in the striped shirt seemed like she wanted to be there about as much as an anorexic at a Vegas buffet. The organic wine tasted like bile. We ordered several apps that were delish: the calamari, lobster rolls, oysters and bison tartar, all were amazing but the portions were so tiny we needed to use our cellphone flashlights to see the food in the darkly lit atmosphere. The mains were OK at best with the exception of the Brisket (amazing)  but for $65 I could have bought a portion of a small cow. Another huge faux pas; we were only served water once during our 2.5 hour visit. Maybe she was scared that some of us were bed wetters?  We finished off the night with several deserts, the Apple pie was our fave. Our waitress by that point was so absent we thought she went home for a nap. In the end we complained to the manager about the 20% mandatory gratuity that definitely did not reflect the quality of service you would expect with a $500 bill....Then it happened!!! The non - discreet pow pow of managers and other staffers, in full view of the entire restaurant,  hashing out our complaints. Humiliated, hungry and all suffering from acute dehydration we left having been poorly compensated.  The food was delicious but overpriced and the service/management appeared to have been headhunted from your local neighborhood subway. In conclusion if you do decide to go to Model Milk: Eat first and bring a water bottle."}
{"text":"Really, Calgary? Really?!? I know at least some of you have dined elsewhere in the world where food is held to a relatively higher standard, but top restaurant and top chef of the year? Imagine yourself a regular fine diner in NYC happening upon this establishment in search of a Western Canadian dining experience. Leave impressed they would not.......

Mediocre. Uninspiring. Blasé. Yeah, this is what we experienced. At the end of our meal, we mulled over the dessert menu trying to decide if there was a glimmer of hope there, but after the bland nature of our main course we left to prepare something more certain at home.

The Brant Lake Wagyu (which appears to be a new addition to the menu) should simply be called \"Hybrid Alberta Beef\", which is what it is. The Brant Lake brand of Wagyu is simply the product of a few imported Wagyu bulls and some regular old Alberta angus cows. The end product is about as close to Wagyu as I am to becoming a Calvin Klein underwear model. Served less well than medium rare, the meat was still tough to cut and chewed about as well as my mother-in-laws strip steaks. You can put lipstick on a pig, it's still just a pig.

My wife had the halibut. As we left the restaurant, she remarked how disgusted Gordon Ramsay would be at the pricing beside such a bland, unseasoned protein. Had she not starved herself in anticipation of eating at what was supposed to be Calgary's premiere dining establishment, she would have certainly sent this dish back to the kitchen.

In conclusion, Calgary, please stop rating restaurants so highly just because it's hard to get a reservation. Michelin 1 Star this is not."}
{"text":"Extremely slow and poor service.  After our appetizers arrived, we had to wait for more than 45 minutes for our entrées to arrive."}
{"text":"I write this review with a little hesitance and mixed emotions. [Yeah, I get emotional sometimes, so what, go fuck yourself]

My usual rule of thumb is 3 times. If I go to an establishment 3 times and 3 times I am unimpressed, I don't go back. I have been to Model Milk about a half dozen times. Normally, you would think it passed the test, but I unfortunately have to say it hasn't. And like other \"En Route\" top new restaurants I have tried, I leave unimpressed every time.

I have mixed emotions because I secretly want this restaurant to be a number 2 new restaurant. I am friendly with the owners and many of my friends are good patrons to this establishment. But I can't fucking skew a review, just because... It would go against my Mission.

A few weeks ago, I dined here with my wife and another couple. It was her first time dining here, and my perhaps 6th. I was not going to return, but she wanted to try and I hadn't gone back since the it got it's article published in En Route.

We walked in on a cold night before Xmas, and sat at the bar for a drink while waiting for our friends. I must say the cocktails are quite fun and delicious. I won't use the term Mixologist, because quite frankly it is idiotic (i.e. douchy), but the bar and it's staff know how to mix a drink.

At one point we ventured to our table after meeting our guests and we decided to share apps and mains.

APPETIZERS:

1. Oysters on the half shell.

2. Fois Gras Parfait.

3. Beet Salad.

4. Rabbit Salad.

Oysters were not fresh and tasted off a little. Beet salad was OK, but lacked taste, Foie Gras Parfait was good. Rabbit Salad, was Meh! The Mortadella on the crostini was good, but the combination was weird.

Main Course:

The thing I remember the most about the main was the lamb. It lacked taste, although the jus/demi-glace was good. They grill the leg there. I guess I don't like grilled leg of lamb. Call me a traditionalist but it should be roasted slow and low. A leg of lamb is not very tender in general. If you grill a piece of it, the high heat will tense the meat. Lamb is one of those funny meats that really needs to be served medium rare, but needs to be cooked in such a way that some collagen has time to melt off, making it more tender. Needless to say, it was tough and did not taste very good.

There are props to be given. The space is unique and well designed. The service is very effective and unpretentious. The quality of all the ingredients are quite good.

I guess I just don't get it. Maybe I am retarded or have no clue about good food, but that can't be fuckin true!! C'mon...

The setting is extremely Bistro, and the menu has a bistro take, but I find there is too much fusion and not enough clarity in the preparation of the food. The Saucier/Entremetier (usually combined in North American small kitchen brigades: The one who grills meat and prepares sides for main courses) must be going bananas... So many different types of items and flavors, well prepared, but out of proper context. I WILL STRESS THIS POINT, there is a lot of talent in that kitchen. Chef, sous-chefs and the rest of the brigade know how to prepare the food. I just believe, and this is my opinion, there is too much unnecessary complexity in the final dish.

I really wished this place to be as true french bistro where I could walk in and eat one of the best Boeuf Bourgignon in Canada (a la Thomas Keller). In the summer have the best seafood platter and Nicoise salad... To me, if you are true bistro, those items or a good take on that needs to be somewhere and needs to be simple and well done.

ITS TOO COMPLEX.

I leave every time with no memory of the food, just the people I was with."}
{"text":"The best meal I've had in the city. Intricate, interesting flavours and combinations. Probably one of 3 or so restaurants that truly push the envelop and maintain a creative edge. 
The price point is no joke though. So go once you have paid all your bills."}
{"text":"They have an Interesting innovative menu.  The portions were small but that doesn't bother me as long as the quality is there.  We had excellent service after we made the server aware we did not need an education selecting wine.  The problem really was the dishes were all too salty.  The quail and snails that I had was very greasy and lacking flavor.  I had also asked for bread which I would have been willing to pay for and was informed it wasn't that kind of restaurant... what?
Yet...another disappointment."}
{"text":"Model Milk is a must when in Calgary. The best seats in the house are at the chef's bar in the back- just be prepared for the kitchen heat. Ambiance from the bar up front to the balcony seating is trendy and interesting. 

Service is attentive without being overbearing. On my last visit, Shane was glad to make recommendations and did not steer us wrong when it came to both cocktails and entrees. 

The reviews are right- the dishes are as thoughtful and tasty as they are beautiful. The kitchen's talent and passion are apparent in every plate.

Go, eat, drink, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent food taste, very good service, super atmosphere. So why the low rating?

Chefs, don't wipe your nose and toss the salad (4x). Don't taste the sauce, dip your spoon in water and use the spoon to serve the sauce for my fish. Don't use your tweezers as a fork and then serve my meal. Do I want you tasting the food to make sure it is seasoned correctly? Yes! But grab a bunch of teaspoons and use those for tasting. I don't want you double-dipping into my food.

I'd love to come back, but I'll wait for a health inspector to visit first. Maybe people sitting at the food bar can create a new game. See who can count the most times the chefs double dip into your food. Yum!"}
{"text":"Eat there the night they received news about being the 2nd best restaurant in Canada.  Pretty loud, but everyone at the restaurant was really nice.  Our waiter was especially thoughtful, and made sure that our reservation of 5 was able to accomodate 7 people instead.  The food was amazing - the mushroom appetizer was wonderful and the pasta I ordered was great as well.  I had to step away from the table for a while, and waiter made sure my pasta was kept warm while I was away.  The desserts there were very large, easily able to be shared between 2 people.  Overall, a wonderful place to try, and hopefully will be back again soon."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined with another couple at Model Milk on Saturday May 4th and I must say that I was very impressed with the food. We shared 2 appies, the calamari and the prawn rolls which were both fantastic. I had the arctic char with some kind of a wasabi spread and my wife had the pork. Both were well prepared and even though I would normally stay away from anything with wasabi, it was great and not to hot. We finished the evening some shared deserts (the fat kid cake, ice cream sandwich & bag of doughnuts) which were all extremely delicious."}
{"text":"We have tried this restaurant a couple of times and I'm sorry to say it wasn't great. A couple of the vegetarian dishes were very expensive and small portioned. I'm glad this is some peoples favorite restaurant, just not ours."}
{"text":"Food is unique, delicious, and not incredibly expensive. Went as a group and paid about $45 per person, drinks included. Also one of the best whiskey sours in the city. 

One of my favourite places in the city when I'm feeling something a bit fancier than usual. People complain about the small portions, but I think that's because our sense of what an actual portion is supposed to be has been warped. Having said that, I'm not the biggest guy around, either."}
{"text":"Amazing room and awesome staff. 
Food lives up to all the hype. Wonderful flavors. 
This restaurant is here for the long haul. 
Go to Milk for a great time."}

{"text":"After spending a long weekend in Calgary and eating at some run of the mill \"big box\" restaurants, what a treat it was to wander into Model Milk. 

We brought our toddler along for the ride, and all three and a half of us left happy and well-fed. 

What we tried (all well worth it):
Grilled cheese, foie gras, pig n fig, and the duck entree. 

Add a bottle of red and we're set. 

Great find in a city that seems to require a bit of a keen eye or and inside scoop to land in a restaurant if this calibre. 

See you on our next visit!!"}
{"text":"Pros- Food, atmosphere, people, 
Cons-Prices, small menu and lounge size

Highly recommended!

I went to check it out, not knowing whether it was a bar, nightclub, restaurant or what exactly it was. It seems to be a little of everything with a lot of character. 

For simplicity sake, you can call it an upscale restolouge specializing in the Whole Food Movement idea. What that means is food is simple and un-refined as possible, with preferable local sourcing that is sustainable and organic.

The food menu consists of roughly 10 small dishes and 10 large dishes. The beverage menu was roughly 60+ wines, 12 beers, 10 designer cocktails, plus the usual high balls. As I sat at the bar (in the 20 person lounge) I noticed some higher level top shelf liquor and unusual liquors, like Chartreuse.  The bartenders are very friendly and put on a small show when making each drink with a lot of care and attention.  Frequently they used a lighter to set ablaze a concoction involving oranges and liquor.

Beer selection is a little odd, with no greatly popular names. There was Steamwhistle, Rouge Brewery Juniper Pale Ale, a gluten free beer, among two $16 (355 ml) beers, and others, but do not expect Guinness or anything as popular.  

For dinner the crusted fish (large dish, $32) was recommended, but I chose the rabbit and dumpling dish ($16, small dish). When it arrived,  there were 4 rabbit 'mcnuggets' that were lightly breaded and 6 potato dumplings (gnocchi) with a plethora of small demi-braised carrots and other root vegetables in a subtle sweet sauce. The food was excellent, and the rabbit simply melted in my mouth. As the portion was small, I ordered a second dish which amounted to French fries with cheese on top. The cheese was a hard cheese and was very flavorful and had quite a sharp smell. I received many enquiries about how it tasted, to which I replied that it was excellent 

This is one of the more friendly places that I have been too. Not only are the staff quite talkative and remember your name, but the clientele is upscale and provides some excellent conversation. The rumor is the Justin, the chef worked at the famous Dirty Laundry. As I sat down, I immediately began talking to people about their experiences at the restaurant, all which have been positive.

The biggest drawback of this place is the size and busyness. I could see that the restaurant and the food bar (overlooking the kitchen) were packed and people just kept coming into the restaurant to check it out. In the lounge, it gets crowded with people waiting for tables. The menu is quiet varied, but small and shrinks in size after 10:00pm. 

I had a great time here and will return to sit at the food bar where you can watch the kitchen in action."}
{"text":"I paid $50 for chicken and waffles...not joking at all. The waffles were looked like bit size pancakes and the chicken was supposedly free range. 
The waiters looked like they care about their looks more than customers and they came to you when they felt like it. It's laughable now but at the time we were super pissed. 
There is a positive side to it. The burger were phenomenal. It was probably some of the best I had in my life. I recommend ordering it medium rare"}
{"text":"The menu philosophy here seems to be best summed up as \"delicious stuff we made up\". To demonstrate the lack of adherence to any specific cuisine, the night we went, we had sweetbreads, garganelli, pickerel, and fried kitchen. All except the pickerel were outstanding, so they get 5 stars for quality on all three fronts: food, drink, service. 

Food: I have never really liked sweetbreads due to texture issues, of the fact that they just taste like the sherry cream sauce they are usually smothered in. Model Milk's fried sweetbreads had neither issue. They use the tried and true modern kitchen philosophy of cooking a moderate amount of the star of the dish perfectly, and accompany it with a multitude of complimentary flavors in distinct units that the diner can mix and match. In this case, the shaved cauliflower, the cumin laced crema, the persimmon wedges and more all worked really well to create a flavor gestalt.

The garganelli was a fairly small portion, but was packed with satisfying flavor having been made with rye flour, drenched in chicken schmaltz, and repleted with fork tender lamb neck pieces.

Finally, they had the elusive Hot Nashville Fried Chicken so I felt compelled to order it despite my opposition to paying ~$40 for a chicken, even if it lived at Club Med it's whole life. Well, it was worth it. I've never been able to create a proper version at home so I tip my hat to their crispy yet saucy and really spicy coating, as well as the tender, juicy, flavorful whole cut up chicken meat. The homemade pickles are a nod to the traditional presentation, but their pancake like fried buttermilk biscuits were a nice deviation from the traditional white bread.

Drink: Hipster haters will seethe at the faux typewriter drink menu, and the suspender wearing, mustachioed bartenders, but dammit they make some of the best cocktails in the city. We're not talking variations on classics, but rather completely new flavor combinations that change every month of two. There's no point is telling you about mine because it's long gone, but trust me they know what they are doing. 

Service: I must commend the front of house staff for accommodating us on Valentine's Day. We originally had reservations in their private dining room which was featuring the chef from Maison Publique but we found nothing we liked on the menu. The server was attentive but not overly so, and the general atmosphere was casual but classy."}
{"text":"All of our food was great but I didn't think it matched up with the value. It was too expensive and too loud. The set up is very European with tables super close together. It was difficult for my friend and I to hear each other talking."}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday dinner last month. Menu seemed exciting but the results were disappointing . Nothing wowed us for the price we paid. I do love their apple pie! Definitely recommend that. There is cheddar rolled into the crust so it's a savoury sweet concoction I find myself craving! 

Skip dinner - go for dessert!"}
{"text":"Model Milk, trendy and new, was recommended by yelp several times, and I finally tried it with my friends in a large group.  We tried quite a few dishes on the menu, with special mention to the waffles, and the rabbit.  They were extremely unique and we were quite happy with the food.  It was slightly expensive with portions that we felt were smaller, since most of the dishes seem like it is supposed to be shared."}
{"text":"Wouldn't come here if unique dishes make you anxious. They have some odd balls on their menu. Great cocktails and great food. Only place I can think of that has chicken and waffles in calgary. Yum!"}
{"text":"Had 2 drinks and 4 \"small plates\" between two. Although it was not a lot of food found that we were stuffed because of how rich the food was (in a good way).

Cool vibe. Great service. They are GREAT at cooking food to the perfect ..texture. The calamari (not fried) is a must try!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in town.  The menu switches up.  And it remains super strong.  Also a great cocktail list.  I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"The food was unique and I liked the atmosphere but the portion sizes were way too small"}
{"text":"Visiting on business, saw this place reviewed in a couple places so thought I would check it out! I sat at the bar, and it was such a treat. My server, Pat, gave me just the right amount of space to think about what j wanted to eat. A few of the cooks kept me up to date with all the food they were serving so I could preview my meal. I ended up going for the little gem lettuce salad with onion sprouts and chicken skin, and the scallops with grits. DELICIOUS. The lettuce salad was well presented, crispy, and tasty. The scallops were sweet, grits were cheesy, and the duck egg net was very cool. While the food was impressive, I'm giving five stars for service- a lot of servers and cooks chatted with me throughout the evening, and introduced me to the bar upstairs (model citizen) and to the sister restaurant next doors (pigeonhole). Hopefully I'll be back here soon!"}
{"text":"One of my best friends lives in Calgary and I visit at least once a year.

I always sit at the bar - the bartenders are great! They make the best bourbon sour and I am typically a wine-only drinker. The rabbit mortadella with donuts (i know, sounds gross) was great! So different.

My favourite by far are the deviled eggs. I dream of them. Is a must stop for me in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't rush back.  It seems like Milk is trying too hard to produce comfort food and misses the mark.  Calamari was excellent.  Shrimp tasted like dirt and am guessing that they buy low quality farmed shrimp from Thailand.  They were certainly not local West Coast spot prawns.  Heirloom tomato salad was nice.  Reminded us of the Flying Pig in Vancouver but the food doesn't measure up.  Nice decor."}
{"text":"Food Rating: 7/10
Ambience: 7/10
Service: 8/10

My girlfriends and I were a little iffy about going after seeing their rating on urbanspoon to be below 70%. However, most of the reviews were because of the horrible service they received, rather than on the food.

Started off with two appetizers, Calamari and the Octopus, both of them were very moist and had a lot of mix flavours and they were not chewy or soggy. Neither of the dishes were overpowered by the spices within the dish, you can still taste the squid and the octopus. We all preferred the Calamari over the Octopus though as it gives it a little kick. There was quite a bit of calamari 

For our main course, we shared the Chicken and Waffle, The Burger, and Lamb & Pasta (Macaroni) between 4 people. The Chicken and Waffle was very interesting. The chicken was moist, but the flavour was overwhelmed by the stuffing and the veggies. The veggies tasted like those salty, Chinese preserved vegetables. The chicken and the waffle were on the sweeter side, but the salty vegetable balances it out. For me, the chicken was my favorite.

We heard that The Burger is very popular, so we decided to give it a try. This dish was my friends' favorite dish. The patty wasn't oily and it tasted fresh. I didn't think the burger was anything special. I wasn't a fan of the fries either. It had a weird taste to it, it tasted like it was fried in old oil.

Lastly for entrees, we had the Lamb & Pasta (Macaroni). The macaroni was a little too al dente for my liking. The lamb was very tough and the taste of the lamb was very strong, very gamey. Overall, I did not like this dish very much, but I'm not a big lamb fan, so maybe that's why.

The girls and I decided to try only two out of the four desserts. We heard good things about the apple pie, but we thought it's very normal, so we decided to go with the PB & J Chocolate Cake and the Lemon Thyme Pot Au Crème. The server told us the peanut butter are made from the middle of the Reese Cups. The cake was really sweet and heavy. It didn't seem like there were enough jelly for the cake though. One thing that made it less appetizing for us was that the cake was left in the open with nothing covering it or in the fridge. You can see a ton of employees walking pass it because it was on the counter of the open kitchen.

The Lemon Thyme Pot Au Crème was a great finish to the night. It tasted really fresh and the lemon was really strong, you can taste a hint of thyme and the graham cracker crumbs added a great texture. It reminded me of a lemon meringue pie. The raspberry (?) jelly compliments the dish very well. I loved this dish. It wasn't too sweet and it didn't make you extremely full afterwards. It kind of helped create more of an appetite! 

Overall, it was a great experience. We had amazing service and we didn't have to wait late for the food to arrive. We had a reservation at 6PM, it wasn't too busy, but by the time we left, it was full house. The crowd that night were older. It was ~$30-$35 per person (4 people) including tax and tip.

I would definitely go back to try the apple pie and possibly the Sunday dinner."}
{"text":"My first review on Yelp. I have posted hundreds of photos on Yelp but had not bothered to leave any review; that is until I encountered such a bad service/experience at Model Milk. Had high expectations due to all the reviews but the food were just meh.. which would not be that big of a deal if it was not for the awful service/treatment received from the hostess. There are plethora of good local restaurants in Calgary; I would skip this one."}
{"text":"Had Dinner with a friend there last night - had an incredible experience! We wanted to check out Model Milk as Avenue Magazine name it #4 for best overall and #1 for best interior. 

The food was all to-die-for. We split various starters and I had the Crab Salad and the Zinfandel wine by the glass. Our server Mallory was perfectly attentive and had excellent product knowledge. Everyone one who was working in the restaurant would offer their assistance and I couldn't pick anything out about the restaurant I didn't like.

This restaurant definitely went beyond my expectations. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We anticipated and waited for out Sunday Supper for weeks. Very disappointed. Service was terrible and the food was just ok.  Very small portions and 1/2 of our main protein was completely inedible due to being 100% fat (was steak which really was more of a long thin roast). When we told the server, he said he would tell the chef but then never told us what was discussed or followed up. No one thanked us for coming in and all three \"hostesses\" were busy chatting as we left and didn't even acknowledge that we were leaving. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food was expensive with small portions. They charged us for water without telling us. Service was really good! Overall not that impressed"}
{"text":"Last weekend I enjoyed my first meal at Model Milk. It was DELICIOUS. The service was great, the atmosphere was inviting and decor was quaint. Putting that all aside the Sunday Dinner was an innovative way of enjoying a meal. I would gladly visit the restaurant again, I look forward to it!"}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely delicious: rabbit, burger, pig, fish taco. I ordered the new duck dish as my main last night; I'm still swooning over the sauce and guanciale. Love, love, love!"}
{"text":"I was enjoying everything about this place until our main courses came out.  The atmosphere and decor is great, the service was excellent, the appetizers (clam rolls and cobb salad) were 5 stars.

The philosophy of the chefs is \"what do we want to eat today\" rather than \"what do we want to cook today\".  A nice concept, but some of the menu items don't bear it out.  Enter the main course veal.  It came out in three extraordinarily fatty strips.  The gelatinous texture was off-putting, and it was difficult to eat.  There is nothing more disappointing in a high end restaurant than ordering a main, and not being able to eat it because the chef's interpretation of the dish kills the substance of what it's supposed to be.

Overall, Model Milk is a very welcome addition to the east end of 17th ave, but the veal needs to be toned back in the richness department."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service!!!  

Gave Model Milk a second chance, after having been underwhelmed a year ago. This time around, we went with our server's recommendation to try the \"cheezies\" which were amazing - light, fluffy, and super savory.  Also shared the calamari and tartare, both which were very good.  For the main course, my boyfriend and I shared the chicken dinner, which was (1) huge and (2) super tasty.  The chicken was deep fried with a spicy crunchy coating, and the accompanying biscuits and salad complemented it very nicely.

I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Lamb entree was delicious and apple pie lived up to the hype. The decor/vibe and service was very enjoyable."}
{"text":"If you want to know what it's like to eat at Babbo's in New York but can't afford the flight, I suggest you come here. The quarters are close and the sound levels incredibly high. If you plan to have an intimate conversation this is not the place for you. But if you plan to eat as much good food as any one person should eat in one sitting Model Milk is a good choice. Unless standing in line is just part of your dining experience, make a reservation.

Hubby and I went for dinner to celebrate my new job - yay! Two weeks to final exams and then I officially join the ranks of the full-time employed. Also fully employed were the waiters at Model Milk on Saturday night - the place was packed to the rafters shortly after our arrival and was lined up out the door by the time we left.

We were pretty sure that they were going to try to rush us through dinner, which we hate, but they were totally relaxed yet efficient. I had a martini with some yummy juniper gin and good - I'm super picky - giant olives with the pits still in. We ate six East Coast oysters which were fantastic as is (we spoiled the first one with KimChi vinaigrette - tasty but unnecessary). 

We selected wines by the glass and then shared the mussel risotto - heavenly. For mains he had the Broek pork and I sampled the walleye, never having tasted that before. I think the pork won between the two (is that even a fair fight?), but the real champion of the meal was the roasted parsnip and frizzled black kale in garlic everything that came with the pork. This always happens to me: I should just order a big plate of whatever side vegetable sounds most appetizing. Finally, we managed to stuff in a humongous slice of banana cake with salted caramel and chocolate icing and peanut butter ice-cream, but as I'm not really a dessert person I would have preferred another helping of kale. 

Dinner was about $150 with one cocktail and three glasses of wine, which we consider very reasonable for such a great meal."}
{"text":"Wow. First thing: Eat here. ASAP. Came here by myself on a business trip after the article I read about it being ranked in the top 20 restaurants in Canada. Well deserved. 

Round 1: baked oyster. Amazing. 1 huge oyster, (10 years old I think) baked, oyster motoyaki style, with salsa verde and other savoury additions. Rich, decadent and mind-blowing. 

Round 2: shaved broccoli caesar. Fresh and interesting. I really enjoyed it. For a salad. I figured I should have some veggies. 

Round 3: calamari. Holy Neptunes Trident. Frigging excellent. It almost had the consistency of really delicious macaroni. Get this. Do it. Spicy, tender and better than any squid I've ever been served before.

Final round: Shrimp and Grits. Daaaaaaang! Grits were like creamy, decadent risotto. The egg yolk turned it into something sinful. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the broth was outstanding. Man. Mind-blown. 

No room for dessert unfortunately! Next time...   

I sat at the Kitchen Passthrough and the folks in there work really hard. Congrats Chef. They were also friendly and suggested dishes as well as hooking me up with some samples. The chefs checked on me and even cleared my plates. It made for a wonderful and interesting experience, especially dining alone. That said, I think requesting this area would be a great idea for a first date! It's a little warm in that area though so dress in layers...also great for a first date  

Big thanks to the kitchen and my wonderful server...I never got your name but it says HL on my check. You were attentive, friendly and sincere. I appreciate that. From a service standpoint, I think I was also waited on by most of the servers and management, (as well as the kitchen!) at various times over the course of my meal. The ship is running smoothly here...and I appreciate that. 

Thank-you Model Milk, I will return.

{"text":"Meh. Interior design is neat. Staff were great - food was extremely salty and too rich - takes away from the fresh ingredients used. I wouldn't recommend since I've heard there are so many other options in calgary."}
{"text":"This is the type of place i have a hard time finding something on the menu that i actually want. 

Great dessert and service. I am just not a fan of whats on the menu."}
{"text":"We went here 2 weeks ago and it was the best food I have had in a long time. The Bavette steak was amazing - melt in your mouth kind of good. It came with horesradish polenta which was amazing too. The dessert was really good too. We ordered the apple pie and shared one. It was a bit expensive but really worth it for a treat night out. We went mid week and still had to wait quite awhile for a table but it was worth it."}
{"text":"ever-changing but very tasty menu. beautiful and interesting space. attentive and friendly staff. loved the dining experience here"}
{"text":"Was here on Saturday! and have eaten here many times before. It just keeps getting better.

The staff are attentive, knowledgable and really work as a team to look after you when they are busy and slow. 

The food.... stunning. We had the fried green tomatoes with mozzarella to start. I had the duck cooked three way in an asian broth (forgot the term). I literally disappeared into savouring every bite until finished. Guest had the crab salad, which isn't just a crab salad. Beautiful bright flavours presented.

Also, what a great bar to try some of their well conceived and executed cocktails.

A+++ Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this restaurant because it was rated one of the best 50 restaurants in Canada. Shared the fried chicken and waffles. Nothing to rave about. Was very disappointed.  Dinner was 90 bucks for two people and it was not memorable."}

I will give it another try, just to make sure it wasn't an off night."}

The food was all really amazing...the only issue we had was with the server and that's why its hard for me to give it 5 stars.

{"text":"If you are wondering where to go tonight, go to Model Milk.

Model Milk, as the name implies, is nicely nestled in an turn-of-the century building that was once a creamery. Newly renovated with a shout-out to it's roots, the interior boasts an inviting décor sure to make you feel at home. (With neat-o tables that slide along a steel beam to break apart or slide together for more or less seating.)

My sister said to me, \"fair warning when you go to Model Milk, that place is a time warp.\" Meaning that if you go at 7, before you know it it's midnight and you've fallen in love with the menu, tried that funky lavender liqueur at the bar and befriended the staff.

The chicken with mushroom cream sauce and cornbread sings and the tomato salad with avocado are the best raw vegetables you're likely to eat this side of your garden.

I highly recommend Model Milk, not only because the food is delicious, but because it's delicious AND unique; which is a welcome departure from what you would typically find in Calgary.

I am not the only one that is going to recommend this restaurant, there many are others, and they will bring their friends; this makes Model Milk busy busy. So go early, or late, or on a weekday, but go none-the-less.

T."}
{"text":"Food is good not as good as I was expecting. The steak tartare is excellent but the main courses I have tried were alright. The best part of this place is the apple pie. It has cheese in the crust which sounds crazy but is so good!"}
{"text":"Great food, service, a fun dining environment as well. The chicken and waffles are a delight, the waffles are very different and taste amazing. Salads, appetizers and dessert will also amaze. Can't say enough about the decor and the desserts, so delicious!"}
{"text":"I never ate dinner at Model Milk on this trip to Calgary, but I was there several times for cocktails and the best cheddar cheese crust apple pie. It may be the best dessert in Calgary. Yet, even without the fantastic dessert, you would find me at Model Milk often when I'm in Calgary. The folks running Model Milk may be the nicest people in Alberta.  I felt so damn welcomed by Matt, mixing me cocktails that matched my particular tastes, and Colin who made both my wife and I feel like visiting celebrities.

My first evening at Model Milk I was \"on top of the world,\" feeling no pain after a great night of food, alcohol, and vibrant social interaction.  This euphoria is as rare as a \"double shot\" in my new home of Salt Lake City, due to its repressive theocratic nature.  It can be a lonely place for an effusive, theatrical older dude who loves the irreverent.  Matt and Colin, and the joyful ambiance of Model Milk, brought out laughter with a healthy dose of a ribald love of life.  I cannot wait to enjoy the entire menu at Model Milk, surrounded by happy people, taking a huge bite out of life.  That's what Model Milk's all about."}
{"text":"The meal was delicious. The use of unique ingredients and thought put into the preparation of the dish is superior to surrounding restaurants. The atmosphere was cozy, I enjoyed the dim lighting and mellow vibe. The service was fabulous!"}
{"text":"I want to go to there.

Amazeballs.  By far one the best meals I have had out in Calgary.  We tried a bit of everything but the standouts were rabbit & grits, green bean salad with pickled cantaloupe and the pig.  In fact the rabbit was so good I actually cancelled my main and had another order of it.  We sat at the open kitchen so had a good view of everything happening and even some suggestions from the chef.  

Great wine list, something there for everyone.  My only frown of the night was the dessert..the cake was too dense for my liking.  But at that point I was on a rabbit & grits high and full of delicious pinot so didn't care.  They swiftly removed it and we had coffees and liqueurs for dessert instead.

The service was fabulous.  I rarely would even pay attention to that with such great food being presented but this is one spot that actually has the right balance.  The room is also impressive...this place is just the right size.  If you haven't been go now.  Seriously.  Wave to me - I'll be at the bar swilling wine and eating the rabbit."}
{"text":"Drinks are amazing. Enjoyable atmosphere. Fun place to meet friends and enjoy a good conversation as it isn't too loud."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant six stars, I would. My lamb actually brought me to tears. The restaurant itself is a cool, busy place that I visited with a group for my friend's birthday. Our meal was life changing in the sense that now every time I walk by Model Milk, I feel a tug in my chest... which is actually my stomach leaping up demanding to be fed more from this restaurant. It's a good size place but fills up fast so if you're hoping to get a seat on a weekend, make a reso or prepare to stand at the door. Staff is top notch and served cocktails while we waited for our table. We ended up sitting right at the kitchen bar where we could see all the meals prepared. Model Milk's menu is made up of lots of local ingredients and talented chefs whip up dishes that make Alberta proud. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Had sunday supper here this weekend- 

restaurant is noisy and tables are close as others have mentioned. portions size decent. 

standouts include-  bresaola, spinach, and goat curd. The bresaola is almost like a cross between pastrami and roast beef. Haven't seen this kind of spinach before, but the flavor was a little different in a good way. I also liked how firm the stalks and leaves were. Overall, the this was a good combo with the meat and goat cheese 

the zucchini flower friti with shishito aioli was also very good. The crunchy textures and delicate flavor of the squash and whatever leaves they fried with it were very good. The aioli provided a nice spicy contrast to the delicate fried flavors of the components."}
{"text":"Wow, the best walleye I had in alberta. This 17th ave restaurant had some of the best new unique cocktails. I tried the pickeral, rabbit and octopus and all were cooked with so much unique flavor. Its not the cheapest place to done in town. But if you live in calgary and want a great dinner experience YOU GOTTA GO HERE!!! Fine dining and when I showed up they were playing biggie. If they had a pool table that would be the dream."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm glad I finally tried this restaurant. 

I've heard raving reviews from friends and Yelpers, but I wasn't even close to grasping how wicked this place was going to be. 

The moment I walked in, I was taken aback. This has to be the coolest interior designed restaurant I've seen in Calgary. Super hip. Very modern. Looks like a high-end dining restaurant, but without the snobby feel. 

The food is amazing. I had their Bison Brisket, and it was tasty. The portion is just right, which some people may not like for the price. But I get the impression the owner(s) and staff know they're serving quality food for the right price.

They have a wicked selection of cocktails and beer. 

I'm coming back here for sure."}
{"text":"My favorite dinner in Calgary so far, this place has everything. Although if I was 10 years older I'd feel very out of place, fortunately I'm not quite ancient enough that I can't roll with the young hipsters still .... it has massive high ceilings and also sitting up top so you can look down on the other diners beneath, I just love the rod iron railings and reclaimed look of the place, evidently it's a renovated bread factory. The  original type of table seating is really fascinating, there's a massive I-beam running along the middle of the floor and the tables wooden table tops are planted on top but are movable so you can either add to them and make one massive long family style table or separate them into smaller families or whatever. The food was absolutely spectacular, these photos do not do it justice. Ice cream sandwich was by far the best ice cream sandwich ever - it was delicious creamy homemade vanilla ice cream with lots of vanilla seeds visible smashed between the two best chocolate chip cookies using milk chocolate I've ever had. I tried to share mine with my kids but then I rethought about it and ate the whole thing myself. An additional amazing retro touch is they literally have a DJ up top spinning vinyl. We had a long chat because I absolutely love his taste in music. Movie stars come here all the time and I could see why I just love it. Thanks again, We are moving here soon so I can't wait to come back, so happy for your success. Wish you had places like this in Toronto.  PS did you know that all the movie stars like Leo DeCaprio and Christian Bale while filming Revenant ate here regularly ? Also all the cast from Fargo and even my favourite, Morgan Freeman. Those guys all have great taste :)"}
{"text":"Apple Pie and Ice Cream Sandwhich were the winners. Generous portions and amazing flavours. 

The rubbery Calamari was the loser."}
{"text":"The May long weekend gave both Joe and I a break from our Edmonton scene, and opened up some great eats! One of the highlights of the weekend was Model Milk, a trendy eatery in one of Calgary's hottest districts, Uptown 17th Ave.

Not only does the cow head remind me of Edmonton's Three Boars Eatery, the small plates that we had that night were reminiscence of it too.

It was a busy Monday night, the end of the long weekend. Our table for two at 8pm was seated near the front of house. I would have much preferred the tables on the second floor or even closer to the bar for the view, so request it if you're making reservations!

I opted for alcohol-free that night and Model Milk had some great options on their extensive drink menu. Grapefruit and Lavender Soda was right up my alley, freshly squeezed grapefruit juice, lavender bitters, Gewurztraminer simple syrup, and soda. More please! Joe ordered the Victoria native Phillips Brewing Co.'s Blue Buck Ale.

The menu at Model Milk has a good selection, divided up into bar snacks, small plates, large plates, and larger formats cooked for 2+. The only way to squeeze in more eats is to have two dinners and our meal earlier in the afternoon had both our tummies semi-full and mine not nearly as satisfied. We opted to go with a combination of bar snacks and small plates. Large plates would have to be for another trip!

It was suggested by numerous Calgary food bloggers and friends to order the Dungeness crab roll from the bar snacks menu. I'll pat myself on the back for listening to their wise words! The crab was stuffed inside a brioche \"toast\", through the top nonetheless! You could have easily picked a piece up and ate it as fingerfood or dive into it with a fork and knife at hand like I did. There's a lot of crab mixture inside that little roll! Topped off with some chips for added crunch, this dish was one of my favorites of the night.

If there's a tartare on the menu, I'll probably order it. I've recently acquired the taste for various tartare and I know what I like and what I don't like. I've never had elk tartare before and was curious how it differed from your standard beef. Surprisingly, not too much of a difference. It was slightly gamier (is that a word?) in taste, although the seasoning, avocado emulsion (hidden in the center), and puffed barley covered it up well. Yum! It came with a plate of crostini for spreading. Joe commented on a strong flavor overpowering the dish for him, perhaps mustard seed? I couldn't actually visibly see any mustard seeds in my bites but I didn't mind the flavor.

Our last savory dish was the fricassee of calamari. The squid was cut lengthwise into bite sized pieces making the plate look like a pasta dish when it arrived! Cute! Edamame beans and finely chopped chives made everything pop in color but it was the housemade croutons in the dish that really stood out in flavor. Everything worked really well together! The dish packed some heat though with the addition of Pimenton (Spanish paprika) spices. The overall flavor almost tasted like a spicy Korean dish! We all know how Joe feel about Korean spices. Yum!

To cool things down, I wanted dessert. The dishes had been small (duh, they're small plates) so I figured we could handle two desserts! I was sooooo so wrong. Tip: do not get two desserts for two people. Unless you're starving still. Which you shouldn't be ever at Model Milk. Our desserts were huge! The apple pie was rich and decadent, a white cheddar and butter mixture galore, with a thin crumbly crust. A quenelle of vanilla ice cream oozed over top. Drooooool. Joe claimed this dessert really fast.

I was left struggling to eat my ginormous MM Fat Kid Cake 2.0. I like cake. I'd consider myself a fat kid (inside). That's why I ordered it. I totally did not finish this dish. It just wasn't meant to be eaten by one small person such as myself. But who can resist not ordering it when it's a chocolate cake with a Skor base, crunchy toffee bits, a light milk sorbet, and a passion fruit caramel? Winner! The caramel was what sold me on the menu and yet surprisingly enough, very little passion fruit flavor could be pulled out of it. That's okay though, because everything tasted phenomenal. I ate almost half before I packed it up for the hotel room. Defeated. But sooooo satisfied!

Thanks Model Milk for the wonderful meal! I will definitely be returning on my next trip down south! On Sundays they offer \"Sunday Supper\" a set four-course meal for $35 pp, something I would love to get my hands on. Such well done food, beautiful plates, and in a great space to boot. One of my favorite meals in Calgary, that's for sure! Service was quick and our server was outstanding. We took up his recommendation on the fricassee and it did not disappoint. Every dish to him was \"life-changing\" which was funny. A great dining experience and looking forward to dining there again!"}
{"text":"For all the hype I have to say this place was pretty disappointing.  While the service and ambience was fantastic,  the food was seriously lacking. Maybe my standards are too high since I was visiting from Vancouver,  but the food made this place 2.5 stars at best. 

For cocktails I ordered a dark and stormy (off the menu) and my boyfriend had the gin and tonic. In general there wasn't anything special about the cocktails in appearance or flavour. If anything I would say both our drinks had way too much ice and the gin and tonic was too sweet.

We ordered the rabbit and donuts to start. The rabit charcuterie was nice and the potato donut was well done but nothing really wow'd me about the dish; especially for the price we paid (15$ since the order only comes as 3 donuts and there were 4 of us). In general I think the whole \"serving appies in 3's\" is a bullshit rouse to screw over parties of 2 and 4 which are the norm at restaurants.  

For dinner, my boyfriend and I had the fried chicken main which was really the biggest let down of the night. The \"waffles\" were really fried doughballs that were still drenched in grease. The chicken batter had too much flour in it and was too dry so it would fall off every piece you ate and not adhere to the chicken and on top of this the chicken was overcooked. The only decent part of the dish was the coleslaw which even then didn't have a ton of flavour.  For 50$ I expected a hell of a lot more for our main. 

All in all, this place is definitely hip and pretty, but the food and drinks are seriously lacking. Maybe that makes it a great 4 star place for all the \"hip Calgarians\", but food should always come first in my books."}
{"text":"If there were 6 stars, I would give that many.  Utterly perfect, but LOUD; I'm warning you right now.  Single best meal I've had in years.  Can't wait to go back.  The servers are so great; completely professional."}
{"text":"Model Milk is perfect for pre or post dinner drinks but that's pretty much it. I've had dinner there several times and the food is just alright. Based on the hype, décor and presentation, one would expect the food to be mind blowing. Not so much. The portions are small for the price as well.

The stars are for friendly and attentive staff (also easy on the eyes), excellent cocktails and very cool décor."}
{"text":"This restaurant is all the rage right now. I finally got a chance to check it on early on a Friday after work. Good thing we arrived at 5pm because the place was packed by 6pm. They do take limited reservations but I'm not sure what that means exactly.

We started with cocktails. I don't even remember the name but it was Aperol based with blackberries  - sounded good. It was nice but there was no mention of it being spicy, as in cinnamon/all spice. I would have ordered something else, had I known. But as I don't waste booze, I drank it. My friend ordered a bourbon Julius - very good! 

We moved on to small plates; chantrelle mushrooms with tallegio cheese topped with an egg, served with crostini ($16). I did not enjoy this at all. All that I tasted was olive oil. It was very greasy. Our second small plate was the shrimp and grits with a fried egg ($15). The three shrimps were perfectly cooked but also, not mentioned on the menu, was the topping of prosciutto. Well maybe it was up to us to say we don't eat pork prior to ordering? Unfortunately, we had to send it back to be re-done. The overall dish was  pretty underwhelming really. Very plain.Maybe that's why they add pork? It seems eggs on top of meals are all the rage as well these days. I tire of that - it already seems so 'yesterday'. But absolutely well executed and nothing wrong with anything.

After much debate we decided to share their famous chicken and waffles for two. It was delicious, moist and crispy served with a green salad. I wonder if it is sous vide? I forgot to ask. My only two complaints were that they poured syrup and gravy on the waffles, which made them soggy. And of course the $54 price tag, which I thought was outrageous for six pieces of chicken and two waffles. But never fear, apparently they have Monday night fried chicken nights for $16 you get two pieces of chicken and grits. 

Dessert was a chocolate pecan pie, it was way too sweet for me but my friend enjoyed most of it. 

The service started with a bang - Attentive and knowledgeable. However, as the place started to fill up, or we out wore our welcome, I'm not sure which, we saw less and less of our server. We actually had to physically reach out and get his attention on a few occasions. It made us feel like we were politely being asked to leave. 

Overall, we enjoyed it and will likely be back only on special occasions, as like most restaurants on 17th avenue (or in Calgary for that matter) it was very overpriced. Definitely worth trying if budget is of no concern."}
{"text":"Fantastic menu for the eater looking for great local ingredients prepared with creative and inventive flair. 
Example: \"Rabbit and donuts appetizer.\" Think rabbit charcuterie with donut holes, that have a light tempura-like crisp, balanced out with subtle mustard seed (no vinegar-y/spicy bite) and a light sauce to pull it all together. Apps are great. Drinks are fantastic! Talk to Clint the bartender. Burger is fantastic! One of the only places in Calgary you can order to temp! (No well done burgers here! Unless that's you're cup of tea- but I'm guessing most of you gasped at the thought.)
Enjoy!"}

{"text":"This place is amazing!  You should definitely get reservations if you go, as it can be quite packed, even on a Wednesday, which is when we went.  My wife and I went there to celebrate her birthday.  I told the server that it was her birthday and that we had just tied the knot awhile ago.  She treated us like royalty!  This level of service is what I am accustomed to in American restaurants, but never expect in a Canadian one.  I'll start with the drinks.  We had a delicious sparkling wine, but the brand of it escapes me.  All I can say is try the sparkling wine.  By the sounds of this review I drank too much, but I didn't, hotnesss.  Oh but I could have!  The cocktails are out of this world!  My wife had a drink called \"The Fields are Burning.\"  Why the fire reference?  Because it was filled with cherry smoke!  While I can't remember everything that was in it, the cherry smoke was the most memorable.  The bartender smokes the glass and then pours the ingredients in, so the delicious smoke permeates everything!  If only I had discovered this place in my university days when I had some semblance of a tolerance!  I had, I think it was \"Goodbye to Horses.\"  It was a very smooth layered wine bourbon cocktail.  It was almost as sad to say goodbye to my drink as it would be to say goodbye to horses.  Both of these drinks are award winning for unsurprising reasons. 

We ordered appetizers while we were having our drinks.  I think they are closely guarding a secret: they have perfected replicator technology.  I believe this is so because of just how fast the food came out!  My wife had a melon consume.  it was rich, deep and complex.  I had a pasta dish with pesto and felt the same.  Pasta, even great pasta, is often one dimensional.  This pasta, however, was the most real pasta I have ever had.  It contained at least four dimensions and up to twenty-six.

I had the sirloin cap, a slightly tougher cut of meat than sirloin, but a more flavourful one.  However, it was cut and cooked so well that it just tasted like a wonderfully flavoured sirloin!  It was accompanied by parsley gnocchi with a creamy centre.  It was truly a thing of beauty.  My wife had drunken cheese and donuts.   This was delicious and unusual.   She said it landed well and evolved.  The desserts were rich and delicious!  They had a roti with basil sugar, something that truly must be treated to gain a sense of, a present butter and jelly tart which was fruity and chocolaty, and a really yummy cheesecake.  I can't recommend this place highly enough.   Make sure you come hungry with a reservation, and be open to experiment."}
{"text":"This is the first ever Summer Feast in Calgary featuring three-course menus and 13 restaurants.  As a result, I was excited to give this restaurant, which was advertised as featuring local products, a try for mid-week supper.

Atmosphere: 4/5  Overall relaxed and open atmosphere, with some natural lighting and a good view of the kitchen which is interestingly located on a level above the dining area.  When we got here, it was not very busy, but things did pick up.  We were seated along the wall at a smaller table, which was ok but it did get louder as the night went on and the restaurant got busier.  Parking along 17th ave can also be a little difficult to find.

Food: 4.5/5  We ordered one of each item from the Summer Feast menu - and everything was delicious!  The appetizers were Fricasee of Calamari and summer vegetable tostada.  The marinade for the calamari was definitely tasty and I love vegetables so the tostada was good too.  The main courses were pine haven grass fed beef and braised line-caught cod.  The cod was cooked well - with a slightly flaky outside but moist and tender in the middle.  At first I was a little disappointed at the small portion sizes so far, but the dessert made up for it.  The M.M. apple pie with ice cream was huge and delicious!!  I would definitely say while the appetizers and the main courses were great, the dessert was amazing.  I would love to return to try some of their other dishes

Service: 3/5  Overall efficient, however it did get a little busy at the end so the staff had to rush a bit.

Price: 3/5  Overall reasonable; the main course and appetizer options were on the smaller side but the dessert made up for it

Overall: 4/5  I loved the food here, especially the amazing dessert, so I would love to try some of their other menu options."}
{"text":"A recent Sunday dinner left me wanting a bit more from this well praised location.
The tasty egg salad  was a promising start but the over salted beet presentation left a taste in my mouth long after the bland short ribs were finished.  If the star of the meal, the cod fish ball, hadn't arrived with the perfectly matched lingonberry sauce, the meal would have been less memorable.  An uninspired rice pudding finished the meal without any treat from its overly petite jelly jar presentation.  Super service and someone who knows what they are doing with the wine list saved the rating!  Kudos for those stars!  I hoped the $35. sampling dinner would inspire a return to explore the real menu further, but I think not."}

{"text":"This will be short and sweet: my hubby planned a surprise dinner for me here and it was by far the best dining experience we have had since moving to Calgary 18 months ago. Couldn't rave more about this place, the cocktails were amazing, everything we ordered was amazing, wine was great, our server was well informed and friendly. We got seated at the open kitchen which I loved as well, it was so much fun seeing some of the prep and love that went into our food. Couldn't recommend enough and can't wait to go back. Loved the decor and the atmosphere as well. It was a little loud which may turn some people off but I really enjoyed it, I felt it added to the atmosphere since the restaurant is quite spread out."}
{"text":"This restaurant nailed it.  Good food (my bavette was perfectly cooked), good drinks (Rogue Dead Guy on tap, cocktails I actually like -- some nice sour non-fruity cocktail with egg white), in a nice multi-level space.  I look forward to going here again."}

{"text":"I like the atmosphere and the fact that there is parking behind the rest WAS ideal for my next office party.. 

The food was decent 
Cocktails with 2.5oz ( I had mai tai and caesar- good!) 

Here is why they lost 3 stars. 
Had called ahead of time to see if it was alright to bring a birthday cake to the restaurant.  they said yes and would charge $5 per head for cake cutting.  My friend delivered the cake before we all showed up to surprise the bday girl. 

They cut the cake in the kitchen and brought it to us on plates. 
We were obviously shocked that the cake was already sliced, and said \"oh! We wanted to sing happy birthday\" 
He responded with \"we don't do candles\" 
\"we weren't asking for candles, just wanted her to see the cake before it was sliced! And sing her happy birthday!\" 
He just walked away. 

Not to let that ruin the celebration, we asked him to take a picture for us, he took one without anyone being ready and walked away. We laughed it off and ignored his ridiculous work ethic. 
It was a bday celebration after all, so I didn't ask to speak to manager or fuss about it.  We also still left him a 18%tip - which he did not deserve. 
Won't go back"}
{"text":"Hands down my favourite restaurant in YYC. The food is amazing, the space gorgeous and the staff friendly and attentive. Oh yeah, and the wine list is both extensive and well thought out. I'm already making my next reservation.

Must haves:
Shrimp and grits
Calamari
Rabbit tartare
Apple pie"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal and service.  The shrimp and grits may be the most delicious thing I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in Model Milk for an early Flames pre-game dinner.  We started with the cheese donuts and Fricassee of Calamari.  Each of these dishes were incredible and were unlike anything I had ever eaten before. We followed that up with the fried chicken for two, which was more like fried chicken for three.  It came with a wedge salad to help balance the chicken with some cool veggies.  I highly recommend the fried chicken, and would definitely order it again.  We were too full to try any dessert this time around.  Hopefully next time I will be able to indulge."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Tasty but expensive for what it is. My girlfriends and I were definitely served by your typical spoiled millennial. Our food took 2.5 hours!! I used to work in fine dining and could not believe we were expected to wait that long without being given any free appetizers. We were told we should buy them! We should have walked out after the 1st hour of waiting. I can't believe I still tipped that unapologetic little snot that served us haha."}
{"text":"5 out of 5 for the excellent food. Every dish we had was awesome. The burger meat was sooo soft and juicy (like Holy Chuck's in Toronto but less greasy). The hot fried chicken tasted better than it looked and comes in a very generous portion (good for 2.5 people even though it says it's for 2). The waffle it comes with isn't really a waffle...it was a very oil-drenched deep fried dough (tasty, but extremely greasy). The wagyu beef (the one that's on the \"for two\" menu was excellent and very surprised at the generous portion given how expensive this meat is ($65 for maybe over 1lb? Not very good at guessing weight but it was definitely enough for two). Came with sweet buns (the white Chinese style buns) and iceberg lettuce and their own in-house hoisin sauce (sweeter and thinner than usual) and something like a chipotle sauce. Wagyu and burger were probably my favourite. We got those three dishes to share between 4 ppl (2 guys, 2 girls) and we couldnt finish two pieces of chicken so I'd say we ordered enough for 5 people. We had their Cookies and Cream for dessert which isnt what you may think it is. It was a very soft sugar cookie (5 of them...although we got a few extra cookies since they noticed we were splitting the dessert four ways) with a baby-food jar of custard-like filling that you'd spread over the cookies. It was very good :) 

Overall, great experience. Went on a Monday night so we didnt have problems getting a table. Only thing is, they charged us $3 for tap water (no, it wasn't Q water from dragon's den). We want to come back to try their pre fixe menu on Sundays for $35."}
{"text":"I have a little daytimer book with all of the Calgary restaurants written in it on the last page that I want to try. Model Milk was on that list. It is now off that list, X`d off.

In short if you do not want to read my winded review, stick to drinks and appies if you choose to come here!

Model Milk Brisket, seen on a previous Yelp review was the deciding factor in us coming here tonight to try that but alas, was not a part of the offerings tonight.

When you pull up to the restaurant, you will know from the awesome little white cowhead up high on the store front. Parking was easy, right out on the street. 

Going in was a neat experience - dim lighting, lots of floors to look up at but it is a bit awkward as noone is ever standing there to greet guests. The hostess stand is actually 1 floor up.

The feel and decor of the restaurant is a 5 out of 5 and once seated, we were elated to find out what was to come next. It started off very promising and it had been some time that I was this excited about a new eatery. 

Our server was barely a pass as far as restaurant knowledge, food knowledge, speed of service and problem solving. Service was a 2 star..

Our drinks were very good. Cold, good booze.beer quality. Love the presentation with the mixed drinks - the delicious tonic for EX comes in a mini milk bottle. Anything presentation wise here is highly thought of - to me. I felt like I was in a fancy, exquisite milk carton, in this space with differing ceiling elevations, floors, exposed brick and uber cool, up to the second light fixtures that mixed perfectly with the barn board. I loved up top the open kitchen. The place is a lot larger than what you would think from the outside!

For appies we ordered the cheese and chive fries for $8. Typical fries with herbs and lightly dusted with manchego cheese. It was good, nice sized portion. Then for $13 we got the dungeness crab rolls. Miniscule portions of crab on homemade mini-toasts. Crab is my fave protein and the serving was so tiny I would not have known it was dungeness. The taste was completely marred by the buttery toast and not worth the money.

Mains - this is where is really goes downhill. Between appies and mains - the timing was way off, like over an hour wait between courses...not pleasing. 
Hubby ordered a burger and while we both love salt, his burger patty tasted like a salt lick. Absolutely horrible and he could not eat even half of it. We are not people to waste food but this was inedible. The salad served with it was OK but his mouth was so coated with salt he would not eat it. I am still guzzling water hours later from my 2 bites of it.

My halibut - $33. Uninspiring, under-seasoned, bland but edible. I am not a fan of poached-style fish and I wish I had known this was the cooking method when I ordered it. This thin slice of fish needed to be seared, seasoned and served with lemon. I would never order that again nor would I recommend. I had cayenne pepper and a mini tobasco believe it or not in my purse or else I would have had to send that dish back. BLAND.
This is not one of`those restaurants that has salt, pepper, any condiments on the table.  But, it should.
Food - 1 star.

As soon as we mentioned the issues with the burger, our waitress should have gone to fetch a manager. We only spoke to one as we were paying the bill who did apologize for our experience and did take the burger off the bill. No incentive offered to us to come back and try again. Not even a free dessert offer.

Hard to go from a 5 star evening to a 2! Will not return."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, but little bit over rated. Service is great, and waitstaff very friendly. The wine selection is also good, and the staff are knowledgeable"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to have a birthday dinner while visiting Calgary and after a lot of research chose Model Milk. My preference in dining is small plates for sharing in a casual environment. I think if you enjoy a playful yet sophisticated approach to food in a casual yet upscale environment, you will like Model Milk. We started with two cocktails and a bar snack, the deviled eggs. Good value on both. We ordered four small plates plus a dessert to share and it was a little too much food but were celebrating my birthday and wanted to feel stuffed anyway. Many of the dishes are rich, and all are bursting with flavor and nuances. We got the chilled soup, which was fabulous. The bits of stilton inside added just a touch of tang, reminiscent of the accomplished Eastern European chilled soups I had been thinking about over the past few days. And they did not skimp on the Macadamia nuts, which were in pretty much every bite. They nailed the concept of a chilled soup, and the soup also took the place of a salad in terms of offering something light, crisp, and fresh as counterpoint for the richer and fattier dishes we ordered. In addition to this, we ordered the calamari fricasse, and much has been said already about this dish so no need to repeat but I will say it is damn good, playful and creative especially in the rendering of the calamari like a pasta. The two richer dishes we ordered were the sweetbreads and the elk tartare. The sweetbreads were served on an asparagus puree, which I suggested should really be turned into another chilled soup because it was so bright and fresh. Excellent dish, executed flawlessly, but very rich of course. The elk tartare was probably my favorite. I don't eat a lot of meat, and never cook it at home, so this was a real treat for me. It was bang on; I can't stand when tartars have too much adulterating flavors and this one really lets the meat shine, while also being perfectly (meaning subtly) seasoned and accompanied by the avocado emulsion for necessary unctuousness. I had to close my eyes while chewing each morsel, it was a powerful and transcendent dish ideal for a special occasion like this. Finally, we ordered the apple pie. I don't normally like apple pie but was determined to give this one a chance having read about it in reviews. I made the right choice, as this is apple pie for people who don't like apple pie. Baking the cheddar into the buttery crust is a genius approach. The little saltiness from the cheese elevates this to being beyond pie. If you don't like pie, but have an open mind, I urge you to try this. We ordered two dessert drinks to accompany our pie: a perfect Sauternes and a Calvados. The Sauternes paired better with the pie, but the calvados had that nice woody and dry edge that I crave. Service was spectacular. Water was kept filled without me even noticing. Intuitive timing on the attentiveness. Model Milk nailed my birthday dinner and I'm very thankful :-)"}
{"text":"If you're in Calgary and have to pick one place, make sure it's model milk. The food is exceptional and the service impeccable. The crowd is hipsterish so no need to bust out your Sunday's best. I've been there twice, tried something new each time and everything was on point."}
{"text":"This was my best and most decadent meal in Calgary during a recent business trip - as evidenced by my very large bill at the end of the evening!

If you're into craft cocktails - this is place definitely deserves some hype. The girl-crush worthy blonde bartender made my friend and I some absolutely phenomenal cocktails, and we loved the history lesson that came with some of them. When we couldn't make up our minds, we entrusted ourselves to her recommendations, all of which were completely spot on. 

We ordered a bit of everything off the menu. The grown-up tater tots were perfect little bites of nostalgia, and there was simply not enough of the rabbit mortadella sliders. We also shared an order of deviled eggs, which were surprisingly good. I wasn't completely thrilled with the texture of the sablefish (didn't have that silky \"melt in your mouth\" quality I expected), but the broth it came in was light and delicious. 

We also ate many many other things, however, my ability to accurately recall them all was increasingly compromised with each cocktail I consumed during the 4+ hours we were there. I do vividly remember the amazing apple pie at the end, which sadly I was only able to consume a few bites of due to the complete lack of any remaining capacity in my poor little stomach."}
{"text":"We walked towards the front door. There's a cow's head hanging over the door with a small humble sign that says: Model Milk. It can be hard to miss, but it was properly lit.

IMO, my first impression was that they're trying a little too hard to be different, from the name, decor, hipster staff. It was a bit of a turn off. So, my thought was, the food better be mind blowing, or they're just lame.

The food:
We had: 
- Buffalo wings sweetbread: 4 out of 5. The salad compliments well with the deep fried sweetbreads. But I found the sweetbread was a bit too chewy, maybe overcooked?
- Pork Belly sausages: 2 out of 5. Did not taste the pork belly at all, the sausages were lean.
- Lamb two ways: 3 our of 5. The sauce were too salty, I liked the chick peas, and lamb sholders were good, but the meatloaf were bland.
- BC Octopus:  3 out of 5. Octopus were chewy, but the deep fried bread balls were a nice touch.
- Carrot Cake: 4 out of 5. The cake was moist and flavourful and the fig ice cream compliments it well.

The overall experience:
We had a reservation but arrived early. There was only the two of us and there was some empty tables. But we were told to wait for the table that was originally reserved for us instead of giving us the available table. We ended up sitting in the mezzanine overlooking the whole restaurant. It was a good spot, however a bit cramped.

Total bill came to $140+tips. We might go back if we get cravings for sweetbread."}
{"text":"Food was good, portion sizes were small though. You leave feeling like you didn't get the best bang for your buck and you are left wanting more. Literally went and got a burger from Clive burger after. 

Service was decent. I most likely won't be back unless someone is else is paying"}
{"text":"There was a ton of hype around this place, so there were some real expectations going in. But I wasn't disappointed.  Before getting to the food, I need to talk about the atmosphere and service. We're on 17th, so I'm expecting not much more than a nod in the direction of the table I'm supposed to sit at. Instead, we were greeted by a very friendly host, and had extremely prompt and friendly service the whole night. The guy who brought our food out was clearly very excited to be doing so, and was commenting on how he stared in amazement at the chef making it. When the servers are enthusiastic about the food, it definitely helps the table get into it. So, A+ on service.

The drinks were genuinely novel and interesting, including some of the most innovative flavour combinations I've ever had. A cedar-infused black tea burbon cocktail (easy morning rebel) was  the highlight. Sweet, spicy, smoky, it was unbelievable. Their house gin and tonic is also one of a kind and very interesting. The drinks are expensive but justifiable. You'll spend as much at the Ship and Anchor for a run-of-the mill draught.

And then.. the brisket. Massive portion for two people. It comes with a number of sides and toppings that you can use to build your own wrap with, into jalapeno corn crepes, and dump au jus all over it. The meat was shockingly tender and had  unique, smoky seasonings, some of which I couldn't put my finger on but were complimentary to the other toppings. It was messy, mushy, multi-textured, and awesome. Crispy tortillas and crunchy sprouts meet soft juicy roast. Will definitely be returning soon."}
{"text":"Tiny portions, incredibly expensive and an extremely limited menu. As an overall experience, it was underwhelming. They had a ton of staff on, and as a result, a lot were just standing around chatting."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars just for service!

The food was great. Awesome concept. Cool and fun design inside.

However, they went above and beyond to accomodate a food allergy for me. I would have been happy to settle for something less on the menu (I've done it often elsewhere). I got my food and was sooo excited to get such fabulous service."}
{"text":"4.5 Model Milk comes to mind when I have to rattle off my top three favorite restaurants in Calgary.

Model Milk has delicious food that incorporates unique ingredients that never fails to comfort and delight me (and my dining guests)!

Model Milk is really conducive to sampling a whole bunch of dishes as the menu is dominated by a whole slew of tapas-like size dishes. I've enjoyed everything from fried oysters, rabbit mortadella salads, to fried chicken! 

One caution however - occasionally, Model Milk had a \"guest chef\". If you happen to dine on a \"guest chef\" night, you will not get the true Model Milk experience. One time we happened to dine on such a night, we found the food to be awful. 

Tips:
Get the cheddar Apple pie. It is THE BEST apple pie I have ever had.
If you want to indulge or have a sweet tooth, also try to Fat Kid cake. The description they provide may scare you.... But trust me, it is delicious!!
Make resos! This highly popular restaurant gets booked up weeks in advance!"}
{"text":"HEEEELLLLLO Delicious. 

A last minute friend date night meant that I got to experience a restaurant I've been dying to go to (forever). I know I got off on the late bus. 

The food was DELICIOUS, my friend had the duck and I had the Arctic char. So good. The flavours are so well balanced. And though they did take some time (it was a Thursday prior to a long weekend - they were busy), the service was REALLY great. 

Not only that, but I loved their small bites - the cheesy puff things, OMG. And the grown up tater-tots, I'll be back just for those. 

Along with great food, amazing service, I also appreciate really good cocktails. My favourite part was that they had at least 5-6 different gin based drinks! We had a couple, delicious. 

And don't skip out on desert. A place that's super busy, but takes a walk-in, delivers excellent service and food and drinks to go back for deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"You know you've opened a successful restaurant when I go to round-up my posse to leave and they look me in the eyes and tell me \"We ain't goin' nowhere!\"... This was the case with Model Milk.

Their location has been quite a number of venues over the last 100 years since the building opened as a dairy creamery; the best one being a happening night club with no doors on the bathroom stalls. The place has come a long way!

Model Milk's menu is small but original, food I have never seen on a menu made my mouth water like a tween on a shopping spree in Aritzia. The best dish of the night was the Shrimp and Grits with a chorizo emulsion. ($14)
Just the right amount of creamy and spicy, this is rich and longing to be shared by a couple on date night.

I'm also a real sucker for bread, and the Crab Roll, only available on the late night menu, made me want to wrap myself in a dough blanket and parade around yelling \"Model Milk is the bread King!\" And don't even get me stated on the Calamari Fricassee ($13)

And to wet your whistle, The Black Manhattan ($12), a mix of Whiskey, Amaro Averna, Chocolate Bitters, and Orange Zest is in my mind the best drink in town!"}
{"text":"If you have a chance to dine on a Sunday, hope to get the fish and chips. The themes change yet I was for lucky enough to try the fish n chips twice. These guys know how to fish n chip! The apple pie with cheddar ! They know how the apple pie! 
I usually can only dine out Sunday nights and each time I have been here I have been very satisfied... Satisfied Enough to finger dab this message. I have ate fish n chips in many places and I can honestly say you these guys are top 3! 
Besides that everything else here is amazing. The service and food technique is top notch... Keep it up"}
{"text":"Douchebags or as I call them by other names- Dick Bags, Ass Hats, Mr./Ms. Head-up-my-ass, are everywhere. All shapes and sizes, races and genders, ages... 7 billion people on this planet so rest assured we will never run out.

The last time I was at Model Milk our Douchebags came in the form of two guys who stumbled into here either for a drink or bite to eat after a UFC fight (the TapOut hat worn by one of the guys was a given). Now I don't exactly know what happened but my snooping...err...eavesdropping...I mean...investigation found that these two guys weren't happy with a fellow Model Milk patron putting his feet on their chair  A few exchanges of \"gentlemanly\" words later and next thing these guys found themselves squaring off with Model Milk's staff.

Now I don't know if a few of the fellas on Model Milk's staff were bartenders or strictly working security, but I would never see Model Milk as a place where this kind of thing would occur. Then again even a Church or a Hospital has had to deal with its fair share of crazies. But these fellas handled the situation quite well. They did their best to diffuse the situation and tried to get the two guys, who didn't even seem too drunk because they clearly enunciated their insults, to leave peacefully. I can only imagine the temptation to react to a person who throws so much negativity at you despite your attempts to mediate a resolution. But wow, these guys were PUSHING it. These miscreants were terrible with their insults, but I give them five stars for obnoxious delivery... yelling right at the staff's faces, daring them to come get their \"beating\", and whatever insults hurled towards their family members.

Anyways, the cops were finally called in what I thought was the funniest exchange worthy of Pro-wrestling promos:

\"Don't mess with me man, I'm a one man gang!\"
\"Did you say you were in a gang?\"
\"YEAH! ILL @#*% YOU UP!\"
\"Guess I'll have to call in the City's gang unit\"

Now those reading this review might get the wrong idea and think that this was something Model Milk has to deal with frequently, but no. Given the kind of restaurant/lounge Model Milk is the last thing one would find is this kind of scene. But then again you can't stop a couple of guys at the door if they looked like trouble. Model Milk isn't the kind of place to bounce people because they a classy place to eat and drink, not a club or dive bar. I wanna commend not only the male staff who had to fend off these troublemakers and keep everyone at a safe distance, but also the rest of the staff who tried to maintain the experience of dining and drinking at Model Milk pleasant. Our waitress seemed terrified but kept her cool and brought our bill out professionally.

Eventually the trouble was cleared off when the cops came. I really had no idea what those two guys were doing at a place like Model Milk in the first place. It's thinking \"hey, I feel like having an awesomely prepared meal with a nifty drink to go along..possibly review it on Yelp. But first... I must punch someone in the face\""}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with a few of my girlfriends. We ordered several dishes to share and everything was delicious. Then we got dessert. They had four options and we got them all. They were HUGE cakes. And all were delicious. Very pleasant experience all around."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for 8 pm on a Tuesday night while we were in Calgary and it was packed! We were seated quickly. The Sweet tea was really good but mostly ice. The food was amazing. My friend is not much of Pork person but she loved it! I really loved the squash. Thank you for a really good meal with a awesome staff!"}
{"text":"I love BBQ, beer, home-cooked comfort and junk food, so when you give me a high-end restaurant that takes these everyday un-specialties and elevates them to a fine-dining experience, (excuse the grammar, but) there is no way I couldn't not be in love with Model Milk.

Cocktails: This is one hell of a cocktail menu with some severely awesome and very adult drinks to choose from. I fell in love with the \"Meat Hook\" - 2.5 ounces  Buffalo Trace Bourbon, Punt e Mes Vermouth, Maraschino Liqueur and Ardbeg Scotch. The double whiskey/whisky mix gives you the warm, wood goodness of the bourbon with just enough of that \"I stuck a dirty fish in an old shoe and set in on fire\" taste of the Arbeg to keep it interesting. No sugar blended Bellinis on this cocktail menu.

Food: This is one hell of a food menu. Gourmet Cheezies. Seriously. They have cheezies that are made from, wouldn't you know it, CHEESE! I kept expecting to find some sort of a dusty flavour on them, but they don't. Each puffed, crispy, junk-food lovers dream explodes with flavour from nothing more than the cheese it's made from. To good to be true, right?

Brisket  - This is one hell of a brisket. It comes as a large plate for 2 and was more than enough for the 2 of us (especially since we needed to stuff our faces with Fat Kid Cake).  It's filling and while our server told us it didn't really come with any veggies, it's definitely covered in salad greens and even comes with a bowl of giant lettuce chunks and kimchi sauce to dip it in. I think... I was pretty confused on how to eat this, to tell you the truth. Classless and uneducated? Yah, I very well may be.. but what do you expect from a guy who's breaking the bank to eat gourmet cheezies? I could have used some guidance on this one.

Fat Kid Cake - This is one hell of a cake. I had found a description online but what we got was definitely not what I read. \"Chocolate sponge layered with vanilla cheesecake, raspberry buttercream, salty pretzel and topped with milk sorbet and sweet cherries.\" Sound delicious, doesn't it? The cake we had was constructed in the same kind of was as this but featured many more harvest, fall flavours, so I imagine the updated it from time to time for the seasons.  I kind of wish I knew what was in this slab of wonderful, but I couldn't find it on the menu and it doesn't seem to be online.

Service: This is one hell of a staff they have going on here. The impression started when I made reservations online and found the only unfortunate time they had available was 9:30pm. They (Morgan) were nice enough to call me when some spots opened up to see if I wanted to change my reservation.

The staff were so on top of things, knowledgeable about the menu items and knowledgeable to say \"let me find out for you\" when something came up out of their particular area of expertise. You guys did a fantastic job of curating and guiding us through incredible experience. Thank you.

It was the hardest thing I've done in a while, but I even made the executive decision to turn my phone off for this meal. To my dismay, the low lighting makes for an intimate (while still casual enough for a Calgary local to feel comfortable) setting, it makes for terrible food photos! Instead of taking my own shots this evening, I'm going to sit back and hope that Model Milk posts their own pro Yelp photos so the world can get a glimpse of the brilliance that goes on in their kitchen."}
{"text":"Their unique apple pie is a must try!!! Amazing white cheddar crumble with white chocolate filling....absolutely the best pie I've ever had in my life! Moist sticky inside and crunchy crust outside, rich flavors without being overly sweet. Model milk is a special place to me, had my 2 year anniversary and two last dinners here, we came back here just for this dessert =)"}
{"text":"Very glad that my boyfriend and I checked out this restaurant on our trip to Calgary.  Food is very fresh and delicious. We especially enjoyed the calamari, lobster rolls and apple pie dessert."}
{"text":"Shouldn't be surprised to find such a great restaurant in Calgary!  The place was packed on a Sunday evening, though we waited only a few minutes for a table for four.  Sunday dinner is served \"family-style,\" and we had three courses come to the table in large serving bowls - so fun!  The deviled eggs with spicy cod roe were delicious, as was the calamari fricassee.  All was good!  One of the mains was trout grilled over cherry embers - so delicate, and sweetly fishy!  The sides were prepared with care, and the garden peas with charred snap peas were a favorite at our table.  We finished with Rhubarb Upside Down Cake, which ended with dueling forks for who would scoop up the last bite!  Why \"Model Milk?\"  The restaurant is located in an old milk factory, with unfinished brick walls, great rustic lamps over the tables, and a relaxed ambiance.  We'd go back again - if our cross-countries journey is ever repeated!"}
{"text":"I love the history behind this building and I think that this is a brilliant incarnation of the space. 

My GF and I went for our four year anniversary dinner and loved it. She had \"The Burger\" with morel mushroom ragout & cheese curds and I had the Spring Creek \"Bavette\" steak with a cheddar crust and onion gravy. 

Because we always share at least a bite of each other's dishes, I can say that they were both amazing. The burger was extremely juicy and the morels and curds added a really unique flavour. The steak was cooked perfectly and the cheddar crust wasn't overpowering. In fact, the dish had really subtle flavours that all worked well together, which is a bit of a feat when you are dealing with cheddar, spinach and onions. 

We finished off the meal with peach cobbler and two espressos. The dessert wasn't crazy big which was nice because we didn't walk out feeling stuffed.

Have a look at their full menu here: http://www.modelmilk.ca/themenu.html

We had a couple of glasses of wine with dinner and the bill came to about $100, which is a great price for an amazing meal. 

I've heard that they also have a great selection of drinks and a unique family style Sunday dinner with a new menu every week. I'll definitely be back to check out both.

Here's the info on their family-style Sunday dinner: http://www.modelmilk.ca/sundaysupper.html


I've also heard that the Model Milk building is haunted - although I cannot confirm or deny that. :)

Below is an interesting round-up of the history of the building:
Taken from here: http://www.calgaryheritage.org/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=237


- In 1932 rancher James Colpitts started a company to market milk from his dairy farm in Springbank.
- In 1934 he moved into this building and established a modern processing plant.
- Installed a high temperature pasteurization system developed in England.
- Set up on three floors for production methods using gravity to their advantage.
- No wood was used in the construction of this building - sanitation reasons.
- Made entirely of brick, very expensive during the depression.
- Milk bottles decorate the building - the idea of contractor Fred Jones. Tombstone masons probably made these.
- First dairy to use trucks for distribution. In the 1930s 5 trucks delivered milk, at the peak of business they had 85 trucks.
- In the 1960s, it was the largest producing dairy in Alberta.
- Sold to Palm Dairies in 1965 
- For many years the dairy served milkshakes and 5 cent ice cream cones from its own milk bar"}
{"text":"The portions were actually quite large for eating at a nicer restaurant! The food was unique and delicious - the service was excellent. The chicken and waffles dish was amazing and enough food for three people. Will return again :)"}
{"text":"Just another over-priced, overly pretentious attempt to be different in the service of an incredibly unimaginative cuisine. Service was just OK. We tried the \"cheezies\" and ham and cheese poppers as appetizers. Both were bland and unremarkable. Salmon for main course was cold and perhaps the reason that it was undercooked 
upon presentation. 

Wine choices were alright but the prices are ridiculous for what is being offered. I really can't recommend Model Milk."}
{"text":"I've been hearing alot of buzz about Model Milk lately and all of it is positive.  But since I'm in the food and beverage industry, my schedule doesn't permit me the opportunity to sample Model Milk during the week.

While viewing their menu online, my GF noticed that Model Milk offered a 'sunday dinner'.  Although the 2 entrees change every week, we noticed that for a couple of weeks the entrees were steak and fried chicken.  Yeah, we're in.

We arrived on the following Sunday @ 6pm.  It's a little early for dinner, but since Model Milk doesn't accept reservations, we thought we'd go early to ensure a table.  It's a good thing cause the place was almost full.  Although there were still a couple of tables open on the second level, we chose to sit at the open kitchen which had six stools.  Just a bit of warning, the stools closest to the backdoor can be draughty cause it gets used alot by the staff.  The dishpit and the prep area must be next door cause dishes and produce were coming in all night.  In the winter, I think that corner will be like the corner of Portage and Main in Winnipeg.

The concept of sunday dinner is simple, for a set  price, you get a set menu served family style.  The size of the portion depends on the amount of people in your group.  Three apps ( calamari fricassee, seafood salad, radichio caesar salad), two entrees ( grilled sirloin, grilled whole trout), and desserts of their choice.

It all sounds great except for one problem, I hate fish!  Especially whole fish with the head, tail, bones, etc.  That's just me. \" Are there any other options,\" I inquired?  \" No.  It's a SET menu.\" my server replied. 

I thought that we'd have to go somewhere else, when I gave it one more shot.  I asked if we can just have the steak instead.  Our server said he'd ask the chef.  The nice thing about sitting at the kitchen is that you can talk to the chef directly.  He came up and ask if we'd like fried chicken instead.  Sold!

The chicken had a light blanket of home-made gravy, and the steak was tender and medium-rare.  The entrees came with a huge plate of fries with shaved manchego cheese, creamy grits with a fried egg, and baby brussell sprouts, cauliflower, and macadamia nuts in a browned-butter sauce.  An ice-cream sandwich and a panna cotta for dessert.

Oh, did I mentioned the set price?  The huge amount of food, the depth of flavour,  the variety of the selection, and the great service, you'd think will cost an arm and a leg.  Nope, just $35 per person!  Is that a deal or what?"}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday dinner and it was absolutely delicious. It was a French theme on the evening that we went and there was just 4 of us but the portions were family style and they were huge! Sunday dinner is when you are not able to order anything else off of the menu because they have a set menu for the night. It is $40 and you get 3 courses but the main course has many options and inclusions. 
The only reason I am giving Model Milk 4 stars is because of the drinks. The cocktails weren't that great or spectacular but yet they were ridiculously over priced compared to other cocktails that I have had at other restaurants downtown that were, in fact, unique. The ones here were $15. I also got one of their signature hold the booze drinks which was a Saskatoon and basil sparkling water and that was delicious and only $6- so a lot more reasonable. 
Overall great experience and I will definitely be back especially for Sunday dinner !"}
{"text":"Model Milk... so many great things, I don't know where to start!

The constantly updated menu always gives you a reason to go back. The quality of ingredients and the unique variety of dishes offered will have you leaving completely satisfied. The service is always catered to the customers needs. The ambience is darling! 

I highly suggest this place!"}
{"text":"Alright they get just 4 stars for the drinks didn't get the chance to try the food or at least I can't recall. I was looking for places that did Modern mixology and this was one of the places that actually did understand Modern and Mixology there is hope for Calgary keep up the good work Model Milk."}
{"text":"The elusive Model Milk.  I tried on many occasions to make a reservation here on short notice.  Nearly impossible.  I finally had a concert at the saddle dome far enough in advance that I could plan and book.  My experience didn't start out well.  Because the concert began at 7:30, we wanted to get a table at 5:00, exactly when the restaurant opens.  I arrived a bit early and found a locked door.  They don't have a lounge that you can sit it for a few minutes before the actual restaurant opens which I found odd.  No matter.  

Once I got inside, the excellent experience began.  I was greeted by several very friendly hostesses and escorted to our table on the balcony.  Once we were all seated our waiter came over and helped us select a wine.  The waiter informed us that he was Metrovino trained which gave him instant credibility with me.  The wine list was very eclectic but also very expensive and that was a negative.  Their wines start at around $70 and go up from there.  That takes Model Milk out of the running for a casual dine-out experience.  Our Oregon pinot noir was supurb but, again, expensive and more than we would have wanted to spend on a wine at a dinner for 4 early on a Monday night.  

We started our meal by sharing the garlic cheese fries and devilled eggs.  Both were excellent.  I even made the comment that the fries were better than the garlic fries at Dodger Stadium, lofty praise indeed.  For dinner, 3 of us had the fried chicken special with mashed potatoes and corn bread.  I absolutely loved it; my dining companions were more mixed.  It's possible that their take on Southern comfort food hit the spot with me because I had gone for a run in the afternoon and came hungry!  In any case, I left Model Milk with a VERY favorable impression of the food and would have given the restaurant 5 stars (something I don't do often) but have to subtract 1 for the lofty wine list.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I believe the people eating here are too drunk to know what good food tastes like, or just too full of themselves hipsters.  Everything is pre-made weeks in advance and barley heated up.  The cheese rinds tasted like pork rinds, and were made ages ago.  How hard is it to throw some cheese in some oil when someone orders them?  This place likes serving its staff who wear 'model milk' hats more than actual customers.  

The porchetta and the briskit are so overdone its like a dry puck of meat.  no falling apart, no smoke ring.  They totally lie and its not smoked brisket at all, its just oven-baked brisket.  The brisket came luke warm, but then what can you expect from chef's who barley cook at all, they claim to be prepping all day, when in reality they are sleeping all day from the previous nights partying, too hungover, as the place is a loud and noisy ruckas like a frat house..  I wouldnt call elk tartar \"cooking\" at all.  Thats just preparation.

I had an A&W burger yesterday that was hotter and more 'fresh' than the 500$+ dinner plates tried."}
{"text":"We had been bragging to a friend about all the great independent restaurants here in Calgary. We took him to Model Milk (our first time - and last time there). Well, we didn't think the overpriced burger was worth it  and although the whole roast chicken was good - I have had better.  For the price point it was disappointing. It is a super casual atmosphere - so keep that in mind when you go there."}
{"text":"I'm not from Calgary and my chef/foodie friend has been recommending Model Milk to me every single time I go visit Calgary. I finally went and I cannot wait to go again!

We took the immediate and extended family out for a celebratory dinner on a Saturday evening.  The place was packed and while I didn't find it overly loud, my parent's sure did.  They also found it a little dark (dad had the candle up against the menu to read, lol- oh boy!)  

We started with the calamari which isn't anything like your typical calamari - it isn't deep fried and has edamame and croutons in it too!  I had the beer cheese and donuts entree (their vegetarian entree) and it was freaking amazing.  I highly recommend.  

The table beside us ordered the Brisket and it looked incredible - that'll be the next thing I order when my guy and I come down (because I am MAKING him take me so he can experience this place)

There was a large drink menu and the drinks looked super tasty!  Though I had already been drinking wine beforehand so I just continued with that.

Their apple pie is incredible - seriously, even if you don't have room for dessert - get it, your taste buds will thank you.

Our server was fantastic- super knowledgeable and seemed to be having a ton of fun with our table. I cannot wait to come back for my next dinner!"}
{"text":"Really fantastic restaurant. Breads, wines, entrees, and dessert they all were great. Seven of us split the trout, the fried chicken (my favorite) and the brisket. For dessert the apple pie was my favorite out of the three we tried."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and some of the beat service I've had! The Calimari was unique and delicious."}
{"text":"As much as we had an epic meal at Model Milk,  this is totally a foodie place and there are many lovely people in my life I would never recommend coming here.  The food is different and complex and a lot fo things are going on all at once on a plate.  This is a violation of many chef's rules but it was working for model milk while we were there.  I assume they have flops but what we had was wonderful. 

Our server, Lindsay,  was enjoying letting us play a bit and engaged the chef to help with some ideas because it has slowed down a bit later into the evening.  We had just a grand time working our way through our meal. 

Their cocktails are amazing -  it's one of those times when I wish alcohol didn't make me drunk so I could try a few more drinks without getting blasted.   The fields are burning (or something like that) was my favorite of the night.   The bartender smokes the glass with cherry wood before pouring the drink and you get the aroma of sweet smoke with your sip.   There is egg whites in the drink so it was a smooth,  sweet, smokey with a little pit of a zip kind of drink that was just heaven.  If I knew how to make such delights I'm sure I'd be an alcoholic... so it's probably for the best I know very little about mixology. 

My favorite food of the night was my soup - the melon consumme.  Our server says it's one of the least ordered things but I was in love.  It's a bit weird sounding -  cold soup made of melons,  corn, stilton cheese, mac nuts.  I had no idea what it would end up tasting like.  When I got it, it was weirder because it had onion flowers and peas and probably other things that seem impossible together.  It's taste was wonderful but it's hard to describe and it evolved as I are the dish. It's definately complex and I can see why some people are opposed to food like that and why many would never give it a chance but it was just so different and surprising as I consumed it.  Consumme is also decieving,  it was more filling than it sounds.

My main was drunken cheese and dounuts.  I wasn't sure how to eat it this when it arrived but I did my best.   It was quite nice and again very different with a lot going on.  They won't tell you what all the ingredients are on the menu so it can be a bit of a surprise when you get the food and give it a go.  I think a challenge with the food here is I don't have a a good way of talking about it and I wonder if that is a reason why I've heard good but not memorable out of some people.  If I wasn't mindfully eating this dish I wouldn't remember eating it and that's likely why chef keep things simple most of the time so you have one single flavor that linger vs several things competeing while you eat and the after effect being never neutral. 

The two of us ended up with three desserts.  Fat kid cake 2.0, chocolate peanut butter tart and I'm forgetting the name but it was called naan but it's more like flat little donuts.   Overall the deserts were pretty good -  I struggle a bit with connecting the names to the dishes.  Fat kid cake 2.0 is such a strange cake for a slice that's like strawberry short cake.   Names aside,  all the desserts were wonderful and we over did ourselves with them but it was worth it. 

Overall we had a wonderful time and enjoyed the food.  It's expensive but rightfully.

One of our favorite special occation places has gone down hill in recent visits and this might just be one of our new ones."}
{"text":"Wow. I came here for a work dinner and could not be more impressed.

Crispy duck with corn succotash? Yes please. Model Milk has great nontraditional food that you can get from the lovely open kitchen that you can see at the back. Choose a nice whiskey from their large list and buckle in for a great meal. I also tried out their gin and tonic which they make with their own tonic produced in house. They also have a lot of nice wines and other cocktails. We received great service from the wait staff and nothing would keep me from going back.

I can't see how anyone could have a bad time."}
{"text":"You need to partake of this establishment's culinary delights.  Our night here reassured me it is not hype.

We started out at the bar, whereupon a dapper fellow with a moustache asked what we would like to drink whilst we waited.  Some might call the facial hair \"hipster\", I think it speaks to an adventurous spirit and dedication to craft.  This was borne out when I asked him if he could create a custom concoction.  Bourbon, egg whites...to die for.

The house-made infused gin also blew our skirts up!

The bagna caudal looked like art and rivalled my friend's Italian Nonna's.  The tater tots were pleasantly high-brow tasting.  After stuffing ourselves with starters we ordered the fried chicken & beignets and a salad.

The salad was quite good.  The chicken and beignets were on another level.  Our table became oddly quiet once that dish arrived, except for some meows and snarfing noises.

I'll be back."}
{"text":"Start to finish, a fantastic experience. Very busy, but other staff jumped in to assist each other and get us through dinner. Zack (Zach?) was our bartender and the drinks were fantastic - very talented, helpful in navigating the menu, and personable. Try the Wagyu - it changed my life. Phenomenal experience the whole way. If you have one place to go, make this the one."}
{"text":"Wow. First time here and the restaurant was awesome. The set up and decor very modern with two level of dining. Lively atmosphere and the staff very friendly. 
Menu unique but familiar use of ingredients. 
We are few apps, 3 small plates and 4
Large plates for table of 4. Portions are not big but ordering more plates made up for it. We ended with dessert of kids cake with ice cream. Yummy. Highly recommend for dates or out with group of friends."}
{"text":"Great meal.  We had the brisket with a noodle appetizer.  The poached eggs in the noodle was perfect and was very refreshing way to start off a meal.  The brisket came with some sour dough bread and pickeled vegetables that complemented the dish perfectly.

The dessert was also magnificent.  They had 3 different desserts, an apple pie, chocolate cake and a Mandarin thing.  All were delicious.  See pictures for drooltastic reference!"}
{"text":"The food is good but pricey.   
Between the 2 of us we tried the following: Red Sourdough and Cultured butter,  sausage and grits,  the lamb,  the Wagyu, the peanut butter ice cream sandwich,  and the apple pie.   Portions were small but perfect for trying a few different things,  and jam packed with flavor.   The apple pie came out and we almost laughed at the huge size of the piece compared to how small everything else was.  Almost comical. 
The cocktails were different but good. 
The service was great. 
The decor was nice.
The place is crammed with tables with very little room to move.   Very European in the set up. 
The noise level in the lounge was insane.   Its a small area for a bar and 5 tables,  so we had trouble hearing each other over our meal because the talking and overly loud music playing. 
Long story short,  it was good but I wouldn't go back if I traveled here again."}
{"text":"Me and my dinner mate both ordered the Bavette steak and it was freaking amazing!!!!! I cannot remember what the sauce was but it was green and creamy and fresh. I believe it was served on top of a horseradish polenta which was delish. It was a bit small but if you are ordering an app, you should be fine.

For dessert which was bigger than my entire (LOL) I tried the new peanut butter semi frozen dish with Concord grapes. To die for!! But it is a bit rich so maybe order it to share."}
{"text":"We went there on a Sunday and got a fixed Farm menu.  I shared with the wife of the other couple we went with and ours was delicious...the fish were perfectly cooked and the hen was juicy..BUT our husbands' portion..both the fish and hen were dry and overcooked.  Service was good and we loved the atmosphere.  Friends have been there many times and rave about it.  Try it!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I was able to come here with a group of friends before I left Calgary. The trick is to come before the dinner rush (before 6) and to come with a smaller group. 

The atmosphere was great. We were seated upstairs, so we had a bird's eye view of the open kitchen and the tables downstairs. It's loud and busy, but not in an obtrusive or displeasing way. 

I loved everything we ordered for appetizers - the foie gras parfait, calamari and the chantrelle mushrooms. The mushrooms were absolutely delicious, and what an absolute shame that they don't serve it anymore. (To be honest, I would come back just for that.) 

I also had a cocktail; I forget now which, but that was really good too. 

For our dinner, we (a group of four) had two orders of the chicken and waffles, because it said on the menu \"For 2.\" 

It was way too much. There are about six pieces of chicken per order, and since they're free-range, the pieces were humongous. Deliciously humongous, but after having had appetizers already, it was way too much. 

I wasn't a big fan of the waffles or the syrup and gravy, but the chicken, fried on buttermilk batter, was great. If only we had the sense to share one order between four of us. Then it wouldn't have felt like such an ordeal finishing it.

The service was really good; our waiter was very patient with us, especially since a fifth person came an hour late and left an hour early. 

Overall, a lovely dining experience I would not mind repeating in the future. There is definitely credence in Model Milk's reputation in the restaurant circuit nationwide."}
{"text":"The entrees, one a Japanese-style salmon and one a beef sirloin cap, were each perfectly prepared and very tasty. Our server were very attentive and extremely familiar with the menu, including both the food menu and the extensive drink selections. I told our server my vague beer preferences (dark, flavorful) and asked him to \"surprise me\". He rewarded me with \"Gypsy Tears Ruby Ale\" which was awesome. 

The beam cutting down the middle of the dining room was a bit awkward to circumnavigate, and the proximity of other tables made it less than romantic, but both enhanced Model Milk's reputation for creativity and vibrancy. 

The bars (both downstairs and at the kitchen above) looked very inviting. If I return I would prefer to be seated at either of those locations rather than the main dining room."}
{"text":"I went here in July for my birthday with my sister and brother in-law after hearing great things about it but unfortunately I found it pretty disappointing. We shared 3 appetizers - oysters, sweet bread and calamari- which were all fairly good but nothing amazing. I was probably more disappointed with our entree (a crispy duck dish), which I shared with my sister. The duck was nothing special and actually tasted exactly like a fried duck I could have bought in China town. The best part of the entree was the pickled cucumbers that the waitress didn't bother packing along with our duck at the end of the meal. She only packed the duck but neglected to pack up any of the veggies that were also on the plate. 
The staff at Model Milk stated they regularly change their menu so perhaps it was just a less than spectacular menu this time but overall I found Model Milk to be overrated. I will add, however, that the atmosphere and venue itself was pleasant though - brightly light and cozy."}
{"text":"Model Milk has consistently been on the Avenue Magazines Best Restaurants list for Calgary so I was really stoked to try it out! Went here for dinner around 5 pm which is when they open up so I didn't have to wait too long to be seated without a reservation Yay! They actually have a huge space inside with two levels of seating - something that I really didn't realize when I just walked by it. It has a casual pub like decor on the inside which was really unexpected given their fine dining options on the menu. The server was really nice and let us know that everything they cooked with was locally sourced which is really impressive. 

We tried the fricasse of calamari, hand rolled rye cavatelli and the pine haven grass fed beef. 
The calamari had a spicy and tangy flavor to it and it had croutons and edamame mixed in to it as well. This was an interesting combination of ingredients - I would recommend it. The cavatelli had carmelized onions and was topped off with a poached duck yolk which we then mixed in with the pasta. This dish was not my favourite. The pasta just tasted like yolk in the end. I ended up mixing it with the calamari and that tasted good! The beef was amazing! It was charred on the outside and cooked medium on the inside. It was done really perfect and was placed on a bed of creamed kale and red wine which was a really great combination. I would get this again for sure!

The place was on the pricey side and there were items on the menu that were up to $100. However, they are using local products and making great food so it does warrant trying out at least once! Pigeonhole is another restaurant that is run by the same chef so you could do either one!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place did not work out for me. 
STARTER. We had the bison tarter as the waiter recommended. It came with two pieces of multigrain toast. The toast was pretty good, chewy, crisp and nutty. The tartar though, was a little disappoint without much flavour. 
MAIN COURSE. The main course wan pretty good, got the fish and squid. The fish was fantastic, perfectly seasoned, melted in my mouth. The squid was tender, a bit salty but I didn't mind. The beans was a nice touch to the dish. Very satisfied with the main dish. Watch out for the small portion size though. 
DESSERT. Absolutely horrible! We got the blondie and the apple pie. We expected something small and delicate. On the contrary, the Apple pie was huge! And both desserts were way tooooo sweet. Felt Like shovelling down pure sugar. Not a good way to end a nice dinner"}
{"text":"Loved the twist on Southern Cuisine. Better shrimp and grits than anywhere in the south I have had. Cool interiors. Great cocktails. Pricey, yes."}
{"text":"We've gone downtown just to get a slice of Apple Pie with cheddar in the crust. A Black Manhattan pairs well but you can't go wrong with any of their cocktails really.

Sunday Supper is also a fave excuse to go to Model Milk, as it's a super fun way to get together with friends or family. They do a set menu for s really reasonable price, and we all just LOVE the meal and the experience of it every single time!"}
{"text":"Oh man, it's been waaaaaaaaaaaay to long since my last trip(s) to Model Milk. They still offer their $40.00 Sunday Supper's which is one of the best deals in the city! I met up with P during the long weekend to try their Spanish tapas theme (Sunday dinner's theme changes every weekend). The vibe is chill with sweet tunes, friendly and knowledgeable staff, blah blah blah, let's get to the smorgasbord of dishes.

- Kettle sour #6 ($10.00) - Blindman Brewing is killing it with their sour beers. This one I hadn't tried before; their kettle sour #6 (amarillo & vic secret) went down nice and easy.
- Cocktail special ($10.00) - P went with the daily cocktail; light, sweet and refreshing.

- Marinated olives & manchego - these reminded me of the olives you get back at Uccellino or Bar Bricco. The generous chunks of manchego were a nice touch.
- Pan con tomate - the tomatoes were bright, almost summery sweet. Good start to our meal.
- Stracciatella & anchovy, mushrooms & shrimp and romesco & leeks - three different types of crostini to get things rolling. The anchovies were fantastic, mushrooms bursting with flavour and the remesco & leek was well balanced. All freakin' delicious.
- Octopus salad - tender but still kept its bite, sweet and succulent.
- Smoked chorizo - these were tough to chew and didn't have much flavour going for it, considering it was \"smoked\". Probably our least favourite dish of the night.
- Fermented chistorra - the chistorra were waaaaaaaay better. We would have happily ate two bowls of these.
- Patatas brava and salt cod - came out piping hot. A nice crispy bite; perfect to satisfy your inner fat kid.
- Basque cake and sherry cream - we had no idea what to expect for dessert but it was fantastic. They looked dense and cakey, but turned out to be the opposite. The sherry cream was poured table side and cooled down to become more like an icing than liquid.

So good! Model Milk continues to impress - I'll be back sooner, I swear."}
{"text":"Big hype, poor delivery. Over rated and food wasn't that great. We had a birthday reservation for a large party and still had to wait forever! When we finally got served, the food was disappointing. Everyone at the table shared and tried each others food. Overall, it was just ok at best. Seems like a very lively place that everyone wanted to try when it first opened...but was not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great metro vibe. Trendy but not pretentious. Great chef and staff. Inventive menu using local ingredients.  

Enjoyed the in house drinks. Decent beer and wine list. Desserts are made in house. 

Consider a reservation for busy times. 
Calamari appie is not ur batter covered variety. Worth a try with its tasty marinade"}
{"text":"They are rude and don't care about your business due to their success.  We waited for 1.5 hours and they kept pushing back the opening, without apology.  I'm used to waiting a long time for good food, since it comes with the territory (especially in Los Angeles).  But this time we were genuinely insulted by the hostess (it's almost like she didn't care for us as tourists).  

I don't care how good the food is.  You can't enjoy it if they don't even let you in.  Btw, my wife felt so awkward about it that she felt we were being racially discriminated against.  I hopefully corrected her in saying that they are just elitist.  But that is how bad we felt walking away from this place.  Yelpers beware of the service!"}
{"text":"Wow. What a meal. Probably didn't hurt that out server was super awesome...shout out to Andrew for taking amazing care of us. His wine and cocktail recommendations were phenomenal. Yummy appy's...not huge portions but the Dungeness Crab Rolls were the table's favourite. Entrees were equally delicious...I had the burger and it was HUGE and very tasty. The rabbit dish was great also, I hear. For dessert, apple pie was a hit."}
{"text":"Well made drinks, non standard fare, good service and parking is available.  Sounds great.

On the other hand it is fairly pricy and not not sure that it does anything really different. The best thing is that 17th Ave is vibrant and offers a lot of competition, especially if you are looking for more budget conscious choices."}
{"text":"This place a little confusing as you don't know where to check in with the hostess if you've never been here before.  The front door takes you straight to the bar/lounge area. They don't exactly point out to where the hostess station in and you end up walking straight past it. (Maybe I'm just a ditz who doesn't notice where things are.)

They told my friend no resos were needed, just to walk in because they have a block of table open for walk ins. When we get there they tell us it's a 45 minute wait!! What?? So luckily in the lounge there was an open table for 2. It was sitting right up against the other table will little room to get in and out without rubbing your butt up on top of the other people's table.

Anyway, the entrees were quite good. Their appies were excellent. Maybe we were just so famished that everything seemed yummy. The dish that stood out was the beet salad. I don't like beet at all, but this beet salad was really really good!!!  They don't have a great dessert selection, so we ended up leaving and going to the Living Room for desserts instead."}
{"text":"When I lived in Calgary, I found this to be the best restaurant in Calgary. It felt so lively and energized. Great food as well!"}
{"text":"Came here for a business dinner while in town. We visited on a Tuesday evening. It's not a large place, but the vibe is really nice. There was a good crowd for a Tuesday. My colleague had a Black Manhattan he said was the best he's had, I settled for wine. We ordered two mains and some small plates to share among 3 people. We ordered the fried chicken and tri-tip for the mains, along with ceviche, steak tartar and calamari. I wasn't crazy about the ceviche, it was sweet and had crunchy things in it (I'm more a fan of southwest and Mexican-style ceviche). The calamari was great, sauteed in a mild spicy tomato sauce. The tartar (according to my colleagues) was fantastic. The chicken was tender and juicy. The breading was a bit thick for my preference but had a nice garlic flavor to it. We did the apple pie with ice cream for desert, shared among the 3 of us. Service was good, attentive but not over-bearing. I'd go back next time I was in Calgary and try some other menu items."}
{"text":"I came for the Sunday dinner while visiting from Toronto and was quite impressed! First off, you can make reservations online. I always appreciate that, especially when you are booking from out of town. The ambiance is charming -- white exposed brick, candy-coloured lamps, an airy open space. It feels casual but nice and is quiet enough to hear your DC. 

On Sundays there is only the prix fixe menu available -- perhaps less good if you are a picky eater and want choices. However, for my DC and I it was a fantastic way to try a bunch of different dishes for a very reasonable price ($35 pp for 3 courses). Things are served family style and portions were generous. We started with a bean salad, kale Caesar salad, and chicken heart poutine. The salads were tasty and refreshing. The poutine was just ok... The fries were a bit hard. For the main courses, we shared fried catfish and bavette steak. The steak was definitely the winner, although the fish was nice too - lightly battered and not too greasy. They came with several side dishes: a creamy polenta (my fave), veggies, a rabbit pasta dish, and red cabbage. We finished off with some mini donuts - still warm, fresh out of the oven! They have some interesting cocktails including a pear pisco sour that I enjoyed. 

Overall, a memorable meal with great service. Our dessert was a bit slow, but our server made sure to check up on it and was apologetic. There is also a private dining room upstairs which looks like it'd be great for a hosting a party! I would definitely come back again next time I'm in Calgary to try their regular menu."}
{"text":"Overall a disappointment. 
The service was good, but the menu doesn't disclose key ingredients like the pig's blood in the cavatelli appetizer. I tried to be cool and roll with it, my husband was horrified, the pasta was black. 'What gives it the dark pigment?' I asked innocently 'oh that's the pig's blood!' our server exclaimed. Yikes.
We shared the fried chicken main which was very tasty but of course a bit greasy. The desert was meh at best we had the apple cake and it was flavorless. The vanilla ice cream with it was nice though.
For this much money, and the hassle of getting to 17th from where I live, I would not return. There are so many better restaurants in Calgary."}
{"text":"The food in incredible! The service is amazing, the place is large but quite intimate, it's simply all around incredible!
I loved every second. I'll definitely be making my way out again! :'D"}
{"text":"Came here for their Sunday Supper for an early Valentine's dinner with my gf.  Reservations for an early dinner done through OpenTable.

I've always wanted to try the Sunday Supper here since it was $35 per person (now it's $40).  The three course menu changes every week and is themed (French Bistro when we went).  Even though it's three courses, it's technically more than three since they serve several appetizers, several sides with the main of the day and a dessert. 


The starters were: Saucisson on Brioche, Roasted Leeks with anchovies and egg, Celeriac soup with remoulade.  
The saucisson was interesting.  It was reminiscent of Pocket Dawgs from the Saddledome and it came with baby pickles, mustard and onion garlic jam.  I didn't find the dish particularly exciting since the sausage was not overly flavorful and lacked the savoriness (salt!) to balance the sweetness of the brioche.  The gf had this as one of her top dishes though.

I found the roasted leeks to be a bit bland, however it was nice and refreshing.  I found it went great with a dollop of the onion garlic jam from the other dish.  The leeks were roasted and tender, with a sliver of anchovy on top and sprinkled with a medium boiled egg that was cooked great.  I enjoyed this dish because the egg was cooked in a manner that was kind of like snow and melts in your mouth to form a sauce, adding some richness to the dish.

The celeriac soup was our favorite starter.  It was a creamy, velvety soup topped with an herb oil, remoulade and fried onions.  It was almost too salty, but I think it was just right and the texture of the soup was perfect.


The main was Pot au Feu, which was served with a bone marrow sauce.  Sides: Ciabatta bread, Carrots Amandine, Brussel Sprouts Gratin.
Pot au Feu is essentially beef stew.  In this case it was beef shank which was cooked nice and tender.  I love shank since there is a ton of soft gooey collagen when cooked right, however it appears I ended up with the piece with less collagen (gf said hers had lots of collagen running through it).  Regardless the meat was perfectly tender, the marrow lent it's richness to the sauce which had some potatoes, turnips and pearl onions in it.  

The ciabatta bread was one of our favorite dishes of the night.  The outside was so crispy, yet the inside was so airy and light.  It was absolutely awesome with some marrow jus or the creamy gratin sauce.  We really wanted to ask for more bread but we were stuffed.  But seriously the bread was très délicieux.

Carrots amandine were interesting.  First time trying this and I know it's a French dish, but it was a bit odd to have toasted almonds on top of roasted carrots.  The carrots were roasted well and the toasted almonds were great, but it didn't really come together for me.

Brussel sprout gratin was tasty.  There was an abundance of rich creamy, cheesy sauce (great with the bread!!) and the brussel sprouts were not overcooked.  If I had a critique on this one, it would be that I would expect a gratin to have a bit more of a crispy element (usually breadcrumbs) to it and it lacked that.  


The dessert was a lemon tart.  The filling was a perfect balance of sweet and sour, with good lemon flavor which cut through the rich buttery tart shell.  


The table layout is a little weird since there are tables on the side which are very close to the bottom of the stairs.  The atmosphere was quaint and nice, we liked that they played music which went with the theme (French).  The tables had real candles and they had candles on the wall, lightning was not bright but not too dim making it a good date place.  Even though the individual portions might look small, the food was more than enough to fill us and scrap our plans to try Made by Marcus.  
Although the service was good and attentive, the gf didn't like that halfway through dessert the waitress dropped off our bill.  I didn't really mind it, however I will agree that we weren't just lollygagging around and we didn't ask for the bill yet so it felt a bit like they were rushing us out.  We ate as the food came out and for a higher-end place it was a bit odd that they would do that.  Without that, I would've went for a 4.5 or 5 star on this review."}
{"text":"SUPER pretentious and hispter-esque. Quail cooked in hay? COME ON!

That being said, I actually quite enjoyed our meal here. My best friend and I decided to grab a bite before the Backstreet Boys concert, as it's within walking distance to the Saddledome. The space is large, bright, and inviting, although it reminded me of a cafeteria at first. I'll admit - the first 10 minutes spent skimming the menu, my eyes rolled so hard they almost fell out of my head. I really didnt know what anything WAS, and I certainly was at a loss to choose a bottle of wine. Thankfully, we had an awesome server who gave us great suggestions and ultimately ended up choosing a great bottle for us.

We started off with the Oysters of course, and they were delicious! The mignonette was perfect and the oysters themselves were very fresh. Even my bestie who previously DESPISED oysters absolutely loved them. We then had a few small plates to share; the Marinated Sidestripe Prawns, which - while delicious - were extremely tiny and definitely not worth $14, the Ricotta Cavatelli which was VERY tasty (but could have used a slice of garlic toast), and the Elk Tartare which was absolutely fantastic. We finished with the Apple Pie....droool!!

Overall, our service was great and the food was delicious. Model Milk is a cool place, and I can see coming here for cocktails and a couple of small plates, but it was pretty expensive and again, a little hipster. Just depends what you're looking for I guess. I'll be back to try more!"}
{"text":"I really like the atmosphere and food here. A good friend came from Vancouver to visit me and so I decided to bring her here. Because she was here for work, we could only go for drinks or desserts. So I decided to take her for desserts. Any food that went past us smelled so good. I got their apple pie and the Chocolate Cremeux. We shared and I have to say it was very good. Well I like the apple pie crust cheesy flavor. Also portion quite big. The chocolate cremeux was delicious. A bit too sweet but it was definitely lighter than the apple pie. 

The decor here is nice. It is a sister restaurant of Pigeonhole (very famous in Calgary). A reservation is definitely needed. There is an upstairs for cocktail drinks but they are open certain days and time. 

Have to come back and try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Pricy but quality was good. Service good. Very nice menu choices but not really any vegetarian options. No vegan options.
Hand crafted non alcoholic specialty drinks are fabulous.

A unique and memorable dining experience."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a party of four on a Tuesday.  Service was excellent.  Cocktails were well made.  The ambience is cool.  Records playing!  There's a turntable!  Loved the selection of music.  We had some cheesy crispy chip type things for a starter, as well as some charred crisp peas.  Both were excellent.  I shared the chicken dinner with someone and it was very good as well!  The accompanying waffles, pickles and peanut cole slaw - also very good.  Friends had trout and halibut.  I am struggling with this rating because I really want to give this place five stars.   My only reason for not doing so is that the menu is tough for people who don't eat meat or \"weird shit.\"  (In my book, weird shit = items such as rabbit, snails and sweetbreads)."}
{"text":"This could be the only restaurant in the city that didn't turn into a saloon during Stampede. Model Milk is a place that is unfazed, unmoved and unconscious of the nuances of the outside world. A place you duck in from the cold or the rain, and immediately your heart and stomach are warmed. The bar is a small 4-5 table space where mean concoctions are created, albeit small by volume but with lots of kick. The drink menu is no joke, and they can make an old fashion the right way. 
The menu changes by the season, and as a frequent diner, I've been lucky to have experience many items come and gone. The staple is the in house made burger. Stacked mile high with fries on the side, do yourself a favor and try it. Chicken waffles is made right to share, family style and comes with a full size salad to bring home for your pet rabbit. 
The dessert has never been a disappointed, so save room. The lemon pie in a jar was an old favorite, but since has been replaced by the fat kid cake. This cake seriously has everything a fat kid would love, chocolate, pretzels, caramel, oreos, you name it. All in a cake. 
Best all around experience in town."}
{"text":"We went there for the third time despite the  previous disappointment because they were listed in a few websites as one of the good cocktail places in Calgary. We ordered dessert and drinks which were not good at all. I won't go back because I happen to know other places in Calgary with much more options, better atmosphere and higher food and drink quality. The only thing which was nice was the service."}
{"text":"Model Milk is something different that Calgary offers and I have to say I'm pretty impressed. The restaurant used to be a milk factory so decor is extremely eclectic. I love the exposed stone, and the hanging candles really add a nice touch. The food was delicious although I would say the portions were a little small. The dessert though, OMG. The apple pie with cheese baked in the crust really just made me drool. This pie is to die for, you must order it! There are tons of great wines and aperitifs for after your meal. The casual atmosphere creates a really trendy place and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone! Model Milk is great, I'm coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Good service, good food, buf what's with the tiny portions??? Probably wont have that problem with some plates like the fried chicken and whatever specials theyre serving that day, but most of the pther items on the menu are real small portions and accordingly over-priced. Good thing is they do taste good!"}
{"text":"Well I heard of this place in the air canada magazine on a flight to Calgary, and since it was designated as number 2 in Canada I figured it was worth a shot. Nothing short of amazing, first off great location on 17th, parking at the back so that wasnt an issue. Great decor and friendly staff all around, server was just amazing and so very knowledgable about the menu as well as the wine menu. Very unique items on the menu with what seems like an ever changing item list. Prices were very reasonable for this type of resturant as well, the previous night we dined out at a similar type resturant with prices at least $10 higher a plate with much less quality and WAY less service. Left very happy and will return again when I am back in cowtown."}
{"text":"If you're wondering why this place is called Model Milk, it's because it's in an old milk factory. Although I never experienced it as a place of milk, I think I like it better as a resto.

It's got an extensive wine list, some yummy cocktails (if you want something boozy, ask for the one that comes in a little pail-looking cup. I can't remember the name of it, but it starts with an A. Maybe an abomination? Annihilation? Something like that.

It's a great space to share some plates. The best of what we tried was the chantrelles and calamari. Although I've had the shrimp and grits during a previous visit and, had it been available this time, it would've surely been present at our table.

I'll let you go experience the space for yourself, but so far... so good!

Oh, and might I add that it's another spot with a kitchen open late every night of the week?

{"text":"Great food, lively environment and really good service. Recommended and will return!"}
{"text":"We came here on a quiet night for drinks before supper at Pigeonhole next door. Our waiter J-F (Jean Francois) kept us entertained with his recommendations for drinks (I stuck to beers and CA went the cocktail route). J-F seemed to nail it on the head for everything he suggested and also brought us a complimentary dish of Goat's Milk Cheezies (delicious!). The joint was pretty empty (but it was a Tuesday evening) so the atmosphere was quiet and tame, but we really enjoyed our time here- and were very pleasantly surprised when J-F walked us outside and into Pigeonhole when it was time to take our table there. I can;t wait to come back here! Thank you!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Calgary and heard good things about Model Milk. We had the oysters as an app. They were good but after just being in Victoria they were mediocre compared to those. We shared the fried chicken meal. The chicken was delicious however everything had a strong taste of dill tha I was put off by. Cool spot but the food was nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"4.5*


I loved the outside and the inside of the restaurant.  They have a white cow head hanging above their front door on 17th ave!  and the vibe inside is great!

Came here for yelps triple throwdown but also tried 2 apps on their menu.
- Calamari dish
- Veal dish

Both were very good.  Will definitely come back here for dinner! (p.s. foie gras pie? I'm there!).... Service was AWESOME as well!

*note, they don't take reservations, and Sunday nights are family style dining! and I've heard that the menu changes frequently (which is awesome!)"}
{"text":"This was a GREAT MEAL! I won't repeat other comments but have to extol one of the best desserts I've ever had in a resto anywhere: The ice cream sandwich. My GOD it was delicious, and I wasn't even in the mood for dessert... the \"cookie\" part was chocolate with just the right amount of salt... I'd head back just for this dessert."}
{"text":"Looking for a moderately price yet delicious restaurant on 17th, the white ceramic cow's head above the front door caught our eyes.  We had the special fried chicken with fried egg on grits, coleslaw, corn bread; steak, and the fish in broth.  Although the steak had some veins, all the dishes were delicious and creative.  Had really wanted to try the halibut cheeks and the BC snapper in oyster broth, but they were out of both :-(.  The coconut cake with lime sorbet was moist with a nice contrast of sweet and tartness.    Our teen age daughters enjoyed it very much. The outside seating and interior decor are very inviting and comfortable.  Service was friendly and efficient.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the food and service!

The service was excellent. Our server was very attentive she took the time to explain the dishes to us, and everyone in the restaurant made us feel welcome. 

We started with Country Fried Chicken Hearts, Boudin Noir and Shrimp and Grits. They were all really good. Very tasty! My husband enjoyed the Boudin Noir so much he had another plate for his main course.  I had the \"Pig\" and It was really tasty but a bit too rich for me.  We had the Chocolate Donuts for dessert. It was just OK. Next time we'll try the apple pie.

Would definitely come back and try other dishes. We really enjoyed the evening with the excellent service and really good food."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Calgary. We ordered the elk tartar and the gnocchi. Both incredibly unique, light, and amazing! The tartar wasn't gamey at all, and sat on a bed of avocados. It was delicious! The gnocchi was the most amazing pasta I ever had and it blows my mind as to how they made that butternut foam! The blend of flavors was incredible in both cases. Service was pretty good. The place is a bit loud and crowded but it's worth sitting through. :)"}
{"text":"Loved the food here. We went with a group (ladies night) and had an incredible veal dish. 

The atmosphere was great and good music. Service was top notch.

I would really recommend this place although prices are little on the high side."}
{"text":"Oh my.

TL;DR Model Milk exceeds the hype. It is more than a restaurant; it is an experience. It may be on Canada's Top 100 places to eat but I'd consider it in North America's top list. 

Top tip: sit at the kitchen counter if you can. The staff here cannot be beat and we even got some extra love for the love we fed them. 

What sets Model Milk apart:

THE FOOD
The menu changes regularly so it's rare to have the same thing again, unless you select the calamari, a staple dish.

The apps: The calamari is unbreaded but maintains a crunch due to garlic bread crumbs. It's unlike any calamari I've had before and is both savory and spicy for a kick. Delicious! 

We also enjoyed a foie gras whip with waffle chips, whaaat? My boyfriend mentioned he's used to the solid foie in chunks; this came in a mousse texture. The waffle chips added a delightful sweetness. 

The main event: oh my GOSH we trusted our server when she recommended the special, pork jowl with a fish sauce molé. Being from just north of Mexico I'm all about the molé, a delicious sauce with several spices, so that alone won me over. What we got was so much more, with a juicy, hours-long marinated cut of pork and a molé that made even fish sauce elegant. This blend of Mexican and Thai food, as Chef Blair explained, complements one another perfectly. And boy, did it ever.

Dessert: I was too stuffed to try the apple crumb cake but got the lemon cake with oranges. My boyfriend is not a dessert person but expressed his enjoyment of its light airiness. And I'm not a cake person but this one had more of a sherbet texture.

THE PEOPLE
Speaking of Chef Blair, the staff here is AMAZING. I almost put them as my top reason to visit but I know most of you are looking for food reviews ;)

We got the chance to sit overlooking the kitchen which afforded us the opportunity to mix and mingle with the chefs and our kind server. They hooked us UP with this delicious asparagus with a tart sauce as well as a dessert wine with our lemon cake. We truly felt like stars sitting there with them! 

We have friends who work in, and run, kitchens. We both commented repeatedly how happy the staff is here. You can tell they truly enjoy one another, dancing into the room and smiling from ear to ear.

AMBIENCE
Sexy sexy! It's low-lit but the staff and music make it the fun place to be. We entered to this sexy upbeat salsa music which mixed into some hip-hop/soul. Our kind of place! The decor was also very homey but hip, and it instantly reminded me of restaurants in LA (super trendy and popular) but thankfully sans pretentiousness. 

Thank you Chef Blair and the whole team at Model Milk for blowing our expectations out of the water. My restaurant companion and I are mega foodies who have visited top-raved about spots across all the major food cities in both the US and abroad but Model Milk just moved to the top of my list for the trifecta: Ridiculously amazing food; approachable, helpful staff, and welcoming, fun ambience. Cheers!"}
{"text":"It was so hot this day...
(\"How hot was it?\")
It was real hot!  
I DON'T HAVE A JOKE FOR EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW!
It was only a few days since the downtown region of Calgary was opened following its cataclysmic flood.  I had hoped to slip into Teatro this day, only to discover it closed until Thursday.  I left a message hoping for a table then.  Having parked and paid my $14, I wasn't about to abandon that invaluable commodity to search for another restaurant, so I began quickly rifling through my short list alternates.  NOtaBLE?  9.2 kilometers.  Brava Bistro?  2.1 kilometers.  Model Milk?  1.5 kilometers I can do.  
Just over a kilometer in 30+ degree weather and I in black pants without a cap.  I was going to smell wonderful by my arrival.  It wasn't helped by the fact my trusty iPhone with running navigation system had less than 20% power left and I still needed it to take photos of the meal and guide my way back to my car.  
I'm explaining this all so you can appreciate it when I say that the restaurant I eventually entered was totally worth the walk.  I would gladly crawl across broken glass with my fly unzipped for Model Milk, one of the coolest restaurants I've ever been inside.  Legitimately cool, not awkwardly attempting to be cool, if it was on Top Gear's Cool Wall, it would almost be in the sub-zero fridge.  It's where people go to enjoy food and feel good about themselves while doing it.  I actually felt unkempt upon entering, ashamed at my own uncoolness.  

So yeah, Model Milk is quite cool in a way that I appreciate.  And not because they had good air conditioning.  As proof of their genuine coolness, I actually heard the Charlie Brown theme playing over the speakers.
Model Milk gets its name from the fact that it was built out of an old dairy warehouse.  The exposed brick walls are stencilled with the restaurant's name and logo.  I was given a table, well more loaned, under a batch of lights holding up an awkward slab of wood.  You heard right, though that did sound confusing.  Basically, a bunch of lights with long cables suspended from the distant ceiling wind around an unrefined slab of wood half-way down.  It was a neat effect.  The bathroom looked rustic to the point of requiring a tetanus shot, or at least that was my best guess considering it was so dark, you'd need to trade a doctor 20 menthol KOOLs for a surgical shine job in order to see anything.
The menu was a simple affair, a single page attached to a piece of wood via elastic band.  The absolutely delightful waitress suggested something cold to start, so I opted for some strange homemade soda which, like all homemade sodas, tasted fantastic until I got halfway, after which I began sucking ice cubes in water until I lamented ordering it.  Thankfully, the rest of the meal was better.  I decided to throw the review in Model Milk's favor and order my signature indulgence, foie gras, specifically, the foie gras parfait (with smoked maple, pickled beets, and milk bread).  I have this theory that patrons rarely ever order foie gras so when an order comes in, the chef gets intrigued--someone with a modicum of culinary taste has entered their restaurant.  I got this impression when in Chambar because the maitre d later came out later to ask me how it was.  And it happened again here, only this time, it was a chef that came out to ask.  I doubt they do that for every table.  
And it was worthy of praise; once again, foie gras was awesome, part salad, part spread.  The only issue with such a dish is that the following order has a lot to live up to.  With Chamber, the duck easily surpassed the appetizer.  And Model Milk followed suit.  The broek acres pig (with crushed edamame, fennel, apple, and celery salad) was like eating a juicy bacon steak, probably the best chunk of pig I've ever had.  And I usually don't like pig that isn't \"baconized\" in some way.  To send it over the moon, it was sided with an edemame, fennel, apple and celery salad, a perfect pair with the pig.    
As a finale, I decided on something cold, the breakfast ice cream sandwich, made with corn flakes, peanut butter, jam, and crème fraiche.  A great finish.  
The meal wasn't cheap.  As a starter, the foie gras was the most expensive dish on the small plate menu at $17, but by only a buck.  The large plates were expectedly pricier, with the cheapest being a burger--a burger--at 19$.  This is nearing a yearly indulgence price rather than a monthly tradition price, nowhere near a weekly ritual.  I'd love to go back, but if I was living in Calgary, it would have to be sparingly.  Maybe I'm not as cool enough to appreciate the expense.

If you've made it this far, let me offer my disclaimer that, as somewhat of a hipster myself, I am being ironic in my condemnation of them.  I in no way hate them, but found their clichés appearing within Model Milk amusing."}
{"text":"Holy crap. I don't often write these reviews and it might sound a bit exaggerated. But let's just say if I was in death row and they asked me what I wanted as my last meal, I would probably ask for a repeat of what I had at Model Milk. Partly because of my lack of imagination, but mostly because it was THAT good. 
I kept moaning and I think I made our table neighbors a bit uncomfortable. But I couldn't help myself. 
We tried the elk tartare as an appetizer, and I had the lamb on eggplant purée as my main. Both were truly outstanding. And the lovely waitress recommended the apple pie for dessert, and I was glad I listened. It was excellent!
Also it was here where I had my most memorable beer during my entire trip through Canada. If only I could remember the name :(
Either way. This is definitely one of my top culinary experiences. Thank you chef (whoever you are). And thanks to the very friendly and fun staff. Excellent place!!"}
{"text":"Over priced but good quality. Not willing to make changes for diet restrictions, I asked for no cheese on the meal and was told the chef did not plan it that way so they would not change it."}
{"text":"It's a good place. Like every place in Calgary, it seems like it is probably financed by one of the same three people. I also like high ceilings, and the lamps. The lamps look expensive. So decor is a plus.

 The expensive cocktail rampage sweeping our fine city for the past 4 years has stomped its way through here. They are the prerequisite $12-$15 dollars, and contain two ounces of alcohol. They are also tasty, and come in many fine combinations. Good people, remember that your cocktail list must have at least 2 drinks that come with egg yolk. TWO.

Mainly, I like spending $100+ at this place (when oil was actually worth money) because the chef seems to do two cliches very well: 1) new spins on old favourites and 2) experiment  with stuff that makes most people go \"WHO WOULD EVER EAT SLICED LAMBHEART!?"}
{"text":"Went here in the summer to try something new. They were able to cater to Vegan which is always a great surprise. 

Interesting drink menu, decor was fine. Wait staff seemed nervous either because management is breathing down their necks or they were new. 

All in all good."}
{"text":"Title this review \"A Fall From Grace\".  I've got to tell you, I tried really hard to make this review as positive as possible because I want to encourage this type of restaurant in Calgary - but I just couldn't do it.  I ate there a few weeks ago, but have been travelling so just got around to reviewing it now.

As I understand it, when this restaurant opened a few years ago, it was actually known to be really good. Whatever has changed (and it may be related to the fact that it has split off for unknown reasons from its founding restaurant group - but I have an idea why that happened...) - it's not good.  This is expensive, overpriced, \"hipster diner\" food.

The food could only be described as \"forced\" hipster/trendy - i.e. adding sriracha sauce in odd places, and giving dishes \"too cool for you\" names (e.g. \"Fat Kid Cake\").  I know that they're aiming for this \"funky home cooking\" style - but it just wasn't what you expected at this price point.  When pretty much all entrees are north of $35, and appetizers over $15, you deserve to be wowed.  The calamari fricassee was like a home economics project - some ingredients were underseasoned, some were overseasoned. The elk tartare hadn't been pounded or ground finely enough - was hard to swallow.  Fried chicken was good enough - but really, it's fried chicken, where can you go with that - although it did come with the showstopper, which was these \"waffles\" they were served with.  Desserts hardly got touched at our table - had the fat kid cake but it was an abomination - full stop.

If Calgary diners let restaurants like this get away with charging so much for meh food, it affects us all.  At prices like this, there are far superior places to spend your hard earned dough - go to Notable or Blink, for example, where they are doing it right.  

On the other hand, service was very professional and attentive - 5 stars for that.  Kitchen (which is what restaurants are supposed to be about) gets 2 stars.

If planning to go there, save yourself the disappointment and heartburn and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Wow! We had heard about Model Milk through a friend and went to try it out! It is on my restaurant rotation list now as our experience was fabulous! We sat at the kitchen bar which was great as we got to see our food being prepared and then it was hand delivered by the chef immediately upon completion. The atmosphere of the entire building was warm and cozy. The morale of every single staff member was cheery and pleasant! Everyone in that building made us feel extremely welcome and taken care of. 
We had the deviled eggs, fois gras (I'd go as far as to say the best in town), pork casing sausages, duck and hangar steak. Everything was amazing. I have nothing but great things to say about Model Milk and I will be going back! (tonight in fact) ;)"}
{"text":"What's with all these places and their weirdo names?  If you're as easily confused as I am (we all remember my Coco Brooks review right?) then maybe you're thinking that this place showcases perfection in dairy cows.  You know, some sweet looking Holsteins, those kings of the dairy kingdom.

Well, guess what?  You'd be dead wrong dear reader.

But don't worry.  You'd be wrong, but you'd be happy.  Why?  Because Model Milk has some of the best food I've had in Calgary paired with really really good service.  Turns out that you don't really care about not seeing perfection in the animal kingdom cause your tastebuds are on their own little safari.

I'm a BIG fan of sharing things, especially when you first go to a restaurant because it allows you to taste more of the menu, and if you don't like something, there's always a bunch of other things to enjoy.  The menu here changes often, so your server might have some other recos, but here are mine based on what we had the other night.

Calamari - amazing, fantastic, 
Shrimp and grits -  perfectly balanced, nice kick of spice, just wow.
Chantrelles - rich, decadent, do it.
Chicken and waffles - The chicken is the star here, super moist, cooked sous-vide style in buttermilk - oh YES. (On Mondays they do fried chicken night so you can go back just for that!)
Dessert - apple pie was my fave, but they're all a great sized portion and great for sharing (If we're being honest, I didn't actually order dessert, I told the server that I would just have more wine...he still brought me a fork, but who drinks wine with a fork?)

Bottom line - get yourself to Model Milk and wear stretchy pants."}
{"text":"Really good food, very good wait staff (our waiter knew absolutely everything about the menu, as well as the subtle flavours in each dish).  So, why did I give it a lower review?  Well, the portions are really, really small.  Flavour: great!  Portions: tiny.

I would say that most people could be categorized as people who want quality vs quantity.  I'm not an obese person, but I value quantity as well as quality.  My wife ordered a dish that was an experimental porridge, which was made to be similar to a risotto.  She told me that it was good, but for $30, you'd expect more than a cup of risotto OR porridge.  Plus, it's not like you get anything else with what you order-- her $30 meal was just that-- a cup of porridge with some mushrooms and cheese.  For my meal, I ordered the lamb.  The portion was an adequate size-- probably about 4-5 oz worth.  But, only garnish for greens, a few mushroom slices thrown on, and that was it... for $40.  This place must make a killing on the price to cost ratios.

So, for anyone who is NOT a hipster who values quantity, you won't get it here.  If you ARE a hipster and you will be loudly announcing every flavour \"sensation\" to your fellow patrons, this may be the place for you.  But, when you notice the menu is divided into \"appetizers\", \"small plates\" and \"large plates\", keep in mind that each one of those is really just a single course, not an entire meal.  If you think you're getting out of this place by ordering a single item and only paying $30 per person, you're kidding yourself.  Even for $50 per person, my wife and I could have eaten another couple of courses.

I'm glad I went, but I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I came here for a birthday event not by choice. I ended up paying like 60 or 70 bux for the 3 course  dinner. The main course was fried chicken and waffles. Like are you kidding me? Chicken and waffles? I will never be back or would i recomend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Having been away from cowtown for almost a decade, we relied on some friends to recommend good eateries.  Model milk came up- they tried going before but couldn't get seated so we decided to go at the beginning of service on holiday monday.  On-line their menu looked very interesting, but apparently on Sundays and holidays the just started a prix-fixe menu.  It seemed to appeal to all parties so we decided to try it out.

Interesting concept in prix-fixe: you get a couple of family-style salads, an entree with a whole bunch of sides, and a couple of individual-sized desserts.  The entree choices this night were the fresh burger, fried chicken or pork shoulder.  Wife got the fresh burger... Normally the buns came with sesame, but since she couldn't eat any, they especially went to a sister restaurant down the street to grab a non-seeded bun- nicely done!  Because the meat was fresh ground, it was cooked medrare to medium, so for those who want a little more doneness, don't forget to ask... But it tasted delicious...  I had the pork shoulder.  They tasted great, but they were a little gristly for my liking- not as slow cooked as they had advertised perhaps.

The sides were fantastic.  Napa cabbage coleslaw, cornbread and garlic parmesan grits.  For those who hate of haven't had those cheesy grits, this is a whole new take on grits- they tasted more like a risotto than any sort of grits i've had.  Awesome... If this is your intro to grits, you wouldn't be able to have any other.

The restaurant design is cool- bright open concept kitchen at the back, the main dining area has these tables that are built onto an i-beam, and they can slide the tops along the i-beam to accomodate different party sizes- very cool!

Will have to try to go on a regular menu night, but had an enjoyable time nonetheless."}

Currently felt by many to be Alberta's most important restaurant, British Columbia native and Chef/Owner Justin Leboe's training taking him from Napa Valley to New York to Copenhagen throughout the years, Model Milk was booked for dinner during my first day in Calgary, an early Saturday seat at the counter providing full-view of the kitchen run by Executive Chef Eric Hendry.

Housed in an old dairy, a quadruple-tiered space with a bar at bottom, seats along a loft as well as the main floor and kitchen built into a former loading dock, Model Milk is best described as modern Canadian cooking with an ingredient-driven focus, the menu changing frequently save for a few signatures and divided into Bar Snacks, Small Plates, Large Plates and Large Format (for two.)

Without doubt a going concern, every seat filled save for a lone walk-in barstool by 7:30pm, it is with pleasantries that patrons are greeted at a hostess podium up a short flight of steps, the white walls decorated in old signage lightly reverberating overhead music often drowned out by the din of clinking cutlery and conversing voices.

Served by a young man with a British accent who proudly proclaimed himself a Sommelier between jokey rehearsed lines, a pleasant shtick that only wore thin when it led to him later omitting part of the order, it was after some perusal and questions bout portion-sizes that a four-course meal was crafted of seven plates, the non-alcoholic \"Careful You\" an absolute steal at $6CAD for sour Apple Puree thickening brewed Tea, Lemon and mellow Bitters.

Told up front that the assemblage of plates would be \"a lot\" of food, a truthful statement to some degree but certainly no more volume that most fine-dining tasting menus, it was with a plate of tangy Sourdough alongside a knob of house-cultured butter that the meal got underway, the decision to charge for Bread justified by the Loaf's robust Crust and springy Crumb while four savory Doughnuts registered somewhere between Gougeres and Cheez-Its beneath an avalanche of finely-grated Cheddar slowly melting over the warm Dough.

Intrigued by the produce-focused small-plates, an expected emphasis on Root Vegetables and Tubers given sub-zero temperatures outside, two roasted Carrots beneath a dusting of crumbled nuts was soon presented in a pool of vibrant orange 'Harissa,' the follow-up of charred Sweet Potato topped in shaved Chicken Cracklins' made equally complex by way of airy Taleggio Cream and savory broth added at the tableside.

Always happy to see Rougie Duck, the Quebec-based purveyor repeatedly outperforming Hudson Valley's best in the past, it is without hesitation that I can say Chef Hendry's dry-aged Breast not only out-portions, but also outshines that at Michelin 3* Eleven Madison Park in Manhattan, the crisp Skin and a ribbon of fat around a rosy Breast well paired to sweet Mole while the confit Leg found even more umami in a smear of Black Garlic.

Partaking in an $8CAD Double Espresso before dessert, the combination of a small pastry station and a plate forgotten due to too much chatter seeing the bold brew long-gone before either plate arrived, suffice it say that no meal at Model Milk should end without at least a slice of the signature sweet n' savory Apple Pie served warm and sloppy, the Baba au Rhum-Gateau Basque hybrid entitled 'Twice Baked Brioche' no less delicious with gooey pudding center rich in Booze and Almond paste with Orange Zest playing well off the aromatic Whipped Cream topping."}
{"text":"On our short trip to Calgary, I knew we had to try Model Milk because I've heard so much about it! I'm so happy we went - we will definitely be going back next time we're in town. The service and food are spot on. Our server was attentive without being too pushy. For dinner, we decided to get one of the large meals rather than a few smaller dishes. We ordered the fried chicken dinner, which is served with biscuits, bread and butter pickles and a wedge salad with blue cheese dressing. The fried chicken was unreal. Our server told us the chicken is cooked sous-vide and then fried. The chicken was tender and moist, with a crusty breading. Yum. I also enjoyed the biscuits and salad, but my husband wasn't a fan of the salad. I liked it, and it nicely cut the heaviness of the fried chicken. I would have personally preferred more pickles with the dish, but I do love pickles! I wish we had enough room to try a dessert, but I thought my stomach was going to explode by the end of the meal. The fried chicken was A+ and I definitely want to go back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"It has a really cool ambiance but I ended up ordering a burger and it was ridiculously greasy. I would hold it and and grease would pour out.  Not a feature I would expect from a $28 burger.  Extremely over priced of you ask me. Cocktail was good tho"}
{"text":"Ok Model Milk, where have you been all of Calgary's life? Don't you know we need you?

We got to sit at the kitchen pass. So we got an up front view of what was going on in the kitchen. I had dinner with a food photographer from New York City and we got to meet the chef from Model Milk.

It was a great experience. The food was fresh, on the cutting edge of an international culinary experience. And in Calgary! And what's the cost skyhigh? No. It was totally reasonable. Especially considering the care the kitchen staff takes in preparing your food.

Everything we ordered was exquisite. We tried a cocktail, Eye to Eye. It had ginger and lemon in it, tasted great. It was served in a traditional \"love boat\" champagne glass.

The calamari we ordered melted in our mouths and the flavors were bold. Sourdough bread with cultured butter was to die for. We had shaved broccoli and seaweed with the tofu dressing. So awesomely perfect for vegans. We tried the Gouda cheese puffs. Decadent. Melted in my mouth. Great cheese flavor. Great texture. 

The chef travels all over and has worked in kitchens from Hong Kong to New York City. There was never a moment when the kitchen staff wasn't anything but hard-working and attentive.

Highly recommend for a great dinner in Calgary."}
{"text":"Sundays menus are really good!!.. Everything I had was great, and the service very friendly... I would love to go back there to try the rest of the menu!!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to bring my kids to this restaurant since it seemed like a trendy place that would look down on children. But we were visiting from out of town and wanted to dine with some friends so I called and asked about the kids. They had no issues with the kids and made sure we had a table big enough for all of us. 

Our server was polite and when I ordered for the kids, we asked if they could be served as soon as possible so the kids could be quiet. The kitchen was quick and got them out pronto! I had no issues obtaining table settings for each of my kids (aged 1 and 3) and their water glasses were kept full too. 

The food we had was delicious as were the desserts and the service was attentive. When i walked to the bathroom I noticed the place was packed and there was a line at the door. Reservations are necessary here. Lots of free parking in the back. 

We had a great visit with friends.  Thanks, Model Milk!"}
{"text":"Big fan of my experience Model Milk -- the food was delicious (fresh, interesting combinations / flavors), and the service attentive. 

My friend and I made a spontaneous reservation for 8pm on Monday night. She hadn't been able to get a reservation multiple times in the past, so we were glad to be able to on such short notice. There is some free parking to the side/back of the building, which was very convenient, as nearby parking was tough to find. 

The interior of the restaurant sort of reminded me of a more industrial Restoration Hardware. There was grey exposed brick along with woodsy cabin-like chairs. I liked the decor overall! We were promptly seated and offered still or sparkling water. Although our cups were relatively small, the servers were attentive with re-filling our glasses throughout the meal. 

My friend and I opted to get a few appetizers and one entree to share. We went for the calamari, wagyu steak tartare, foie gras parfait, and halibut. I loved our three appetizers. The calamari was extremely different from a classic battered and fried calamari; it wasn't battered at all and reminded me a LOT of Korean ddeokbokki! Similar kind of red sauce and kick, with calamari that was a chewy good texture. The wagyu steak tartare came with these crisps that we were told to mix in with the tartare (unlike typical crackers that come with tartare), which added an awesome crunch mixed throughout the meat. The black cardamon was quite strong in the tartare though, and really added a powerful kick to the dish. The foie gras parfait was my personal favorite of the appetizers. Creamy foie gras along with a sweet rhubarb jam and several crackers to spread it all generously on. This dish was rich but not TOO rich, and I loved the sweet and savory blend of flavors.

My reason for four stars rather than five was that I felt the halibut was under-seasoned. This halibut was a T-bone, with hearty chunks of meat around the bone. The fish was well cooked, and I liked the light refreshing juices that it was soaked in. However, I felt that the surrounding leeks and potatoes and the fish itself could have been more flavorful.

We were offered 3 options for dessert, but were too full from the rest of our meal! Next time, though :)"}
{"text":"--- Food ---
First time dining here with my partner. We ordered mostly what our waitress recommended:

Freshly shucked oysters (six for $20). 
These are from Vancouver Island, super fresh and delicious. It was interesting they had tapioca to pair with it (not a big fan of that but interesting to try out!). They also had horseradish on the side as well. 

Fricassee of Calamari ($15). 
Very unique presentation - it looked liked like a bowl of noodles! The calamari was fresh and tasty in the sauce. 
Dry aged beef tartare ($18). 
The raw meat was fresh. It came with a side of cheese and some sort of cream - not sure if I liked this combination or not. It was fun to taste it with the potato chips on top. 

Ewe-nique Farms Lamb ($35)
The lamb was cooked medium-rare, it was juicy, tender, and delicious. Perhaps a little on the oily side though. There was goat cheese sauce on the plate as well - unique again! I would definitely order this one again.

Interesting to note that while I was looking at tables around us, a lot of other people ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken ($54). My partner and I aren't a big fan of fried food (and already had a lot on the Stampede grounds) so we tried out other dishes.  

--- Atmosphere ---
The interior of the restaurant looks very modern and relaxing. It's a great place to have a date with a friend. Our waitress was very knowledgable on each of the dishes and took her time to explain. We recommend booking a reservation as it seem to get busier for dinner. 

--- Summary --- 
This restaurant seems to put a spin on the dishes. My partner and I may order some dishes expecting one thing and we get surprised by the twist - either presentation or choice of ingredients used to complement the dish. We loved how all the food were fresh, delicious, and supported local farmers."}
{"text":"I took some work colleagues here for dinner last night after researching some restaurants on Yelp. 4 stars and 151 reviews seemed legit. Being a foodie from out of town, the locals were laughing that I even knew about this spot. Anyway....It looked good so we went. 

Let's just cut to the chase. The food was delicious, but the portions were very small. No surprise, I expect that. But just letting you know. 

We had baked oysters, broccoli Caesar, cheese puffs, beef carpaccio, and ceviche. All were delicious. I had halibut for my main and it was amazing. 

I give the place 3 stars because the waiter was a douche and the overall ambiance was lacking. I looked at the wine menu to select a Pinot Noir and there weren't any from BC on the menu. (Are we in effing Canada???) I asked why and he smugly said, \"French Pinot is better\". Then he recommended the highest priced one on the menu. Total douche move. I bought it and it was mediocre at best. 

Now I will say, it was hilarious when two of the guys actually ate the salt that the baked oyster was presented on. I guess they've never seen it. One of us was from BC, and being from Houston, salt under oysters is standard operating procedure. Regardless, it was hilarious and shouldn't allow the douchebag, bearded, skinny waiter from owning how lousy he was as a server. I'm the one writing this review. Not them. And I've eaten food on five continents and drank Pinot IN France. BC wine is legit. 

Afterwards, the guys went and ate hot wings because they were starving to death. 

Good food, but I won't be back. Calgary is a great city with too much to offer for me to waste my time..."}
{"text":"First off let me say the chef is extremely talented.  Menu items feature a lot of comfort food which have been elevated to a five star level.  While everything on the menu is worth ordering, I highly recommend shrimp and grits, buffalo wing sweetbreads, blood sausage with gnocchi.  Any of the family style (for 2) platters will be guaranteed hits.
Wait staff is very knowledgeable of both the food and beverage offerings.  Wine list has a lot of underrated gems and a lot of thought was put into the cocktail offerings.  Definitely one of the top three restaurants in Calgary."}
{"text":"The Spring Rose cocktail was so delicious!  I had to have another :)

Potato starter ... meh...   Excellent Wagyu beef!!! Amazing!!!   The food took a very long time to arrive.  Then, because I was still hungry, I ordered the Apple Pie.  OMG ~ What's up with that?  The other portions were the typical, small, finer dining works of art and this monster was huge!  Now, I was still hungry however, that just didn't go with the whole experience.  It was, however, delicious!  I expected a work of art with exquisite taste and presentation.  It was like dining and then 'eating'.  Is it an apology for those of us that might still be hungry because we waited so long for our main coarse?
Coffee ~ horrible...horrible.  I don't know what's happened in restaurants these days with this 'pissy', weak light brown dredge they call coffee.  I sent the first one back and asked for an espresso.  Same thing, only in a smaller cup.  They all use one of 2 or 3 locally roasted brands which are not so great to begin with unless you really know how to make a good coffee.  Coffee is the grand finale for us.  So, Model Milk and the group that owns them, get the coffee fixed please.  I'd come back if you did that.  Bad coffee after a good meal is, in my book, a fail all the way.
It's the final taste in my mouth and when it's bad, I'm gone forever."}
{"text":"Food's great, just not fan of the portions/ratios! Came here for dinner for 4 and got the fondue. We got a nice helping of cheese fondue, but the fixings came in very small amounts. Overall the food is very tasty. It is a little pricey, but hey, if you're going to go for an expensive dinner, might as well have good food!"}
{"text":"The ambiance and staff are nice, the food is good, but the portions are just too small so I wouldn't return. I should specify, the portions are too small for a restaurant that doesn't market themselves as a tapas or sharing plates restaurant. I completely understand quality over quantity and different portions for small and large plates, however, if I get a large plate gnocchi I expect to feel full at the end, especially for the price of a large plate."}
{"text":"So I went here for the first time with my girlfriend for a little date night expecting a really nice place. We had a reservation so they led us to our \"table\" but as we approached we realized it was actually just a long cafeteria table and you are sitting within two feet of the guests next to you. Maybe for some people they want to go out and socialize with strangers or listen to their conversation, but that's what I'd like to avoid. I couldn't hear my girlfriend and could only hear the table beside me. We asked if we could be seated at a non-cafeteria style table and they gave an option which was technically a detached table, but was still within two feet of the table beside. So we said no that's ok, and went to another nice restaurant that does give their customers more space. 

I can't speak to the food or service as we left within 10 minutes. 

I am not sure why people would want to go out for a nice dinner and be rammed in there like sardines."}
{"text":"Cozy dining atmosphere with fantastic dishes. I was impressed with the food, and the service was wonderful. To start we got the pork Thai sausage, as well as the shrimp and grit fritters. Both dishes were delightful, I would highly recommend the pork sausage. 
I also ordered the burger as my main dish and it was much larger than I anticipated. The patty was huge! For me it was too much meat, which overpowered the rest of the ingredients and made it difficult to enjoy. 
For dessert we got the apple pie, which was delicious! In all, great spot for food!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here twice for celebrations and it was hands down some of the best food and drink I've had here in Calgary! 

Coming from Vancouver, I am a foodie at heart and I was so happy to go to Model Milk and see some of the most earnest chefs, servers, bartenders, and restauranteurs pushing the boundaries of food culture here in Calgary. The menu is small but complete and well thought out. The cocktails are as creative and delicious as the food!

Price range... Well seeing the final bill is not for the faint of heart... but I think it's well worth it!

Ambience... intimate and cozy with good music. Open kitchen concept so you can watch if you choose to sit at the kitchen bar and ogle the ridiculously beautiful and tasty looking food passing you by.... did I mention that I get food envy....

Service... first class service! The servers are exceptionally knowledgeable about both their menu as well as ingredients in general. Our server happily discussed the ingredients of certain dishes with us and even brought over samples of some cocktail ingredients we were not familiar with. Very accommodating and obviously passionate about food and drink!

Food... I have not had a single dish I did not love here. I believe the menu may have changed but I have tried the trout, wagyu tri-tip, calamari, salmon ceviche, and lamb. The meats were succulent and flavourful. The seasoning was perfect, with complex and balanced flavours. Fabulous textures and incredible use of herbs and spices... who knew something like pickled mustard seeds could add just enough acidity to make a dish perfect  (that would be the wagyu). And lastly, the presentation was beautiful as well.

A whole package deal, albeit an expensive one. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a special night out."}
{"text":"Food portions are small. They play the music too damn loud (like can't have a conversation loud). We ordered 3 plates. 2 small and one main. The 2 small were delicious, but the main dish (rabbit) was difficult to choke down. It was cold and gross and we waited 30 minutes for it. I really wanted the apple pie, but after the rabbit and was told it takes 10 minutes for the apple pie to cook I asked for the check. 

Tip: just order some small plates and apple pie the minute you walk in cause the servers take too long to get your order in."}
{"text":"The food was probably of one of the best qualities I have had in the city! Great vibe to would definitely return for a special occasion."}
{"text":"The name \"Model Milk\" has been driving me crazy for weeks.  Everyone everywhere is raving about this MODEL MILK place.  What are you talking about.  Go away.  Or at least tell me where it is.  And there better be Models there with Milk Makers or something.

Located conveniently on 17th ave, this simplistically designed resto offers a beautiful two level, open kitchen concept that you won't be able to resist.  There is tons of sunlight coming in for you to enjoy its rustic-chic appeal.  The servers are dressed casually and beautifully.  Like Urban OutFoodies.

I came here for a friend's birthday and found they have a unique beer menu.  I enjoyed a Blue Buck from Phillips Brewing Company (Victoria, BC) and a delicious Blonde from Quebec.  (whoa. Just.. just.. whoa.  Not what you think.. alllthough..)

The food menu is essentially a series of nouns thrown together with no real idea what you will get, best to ask the server how it is prepared and served.  I ordered the macadamia nut/dungeness crab/grapefruit salad.  All appies are great for sharing.  And what amazing flavour combinations.  I tried an oyster as well, I don't normally enjoy a slurp-a-lurp but the sauce to go with it was unreal.

My main was the PIG which was essentially 4 rounds of bacony, ground sausagy goodness with cauliflower.  I couldn't eat it all, the portion sizes were amazing.  Some friends ordered the burger and FRIEZ, the chicken, and the lamb.  All dishes were thoroughly enjoyed and a lot were actually taken home.

The only thing keeping me from making this a 5 star night out was the service.  The service was good, but not great.  Plates sat in front of us for quite some time after our mains were finished, and we were not asked for coffee or tea with dessert.  In fact, we weren't really asked if we wanted dessert either.  We were too full either way.

Model Milk is not a get in, get out restaurant.  It's a come in, relax, enjoy the wine, enjoy the company type restaurant.  We had to wait on our bill to make a quick escape for a little while, and he was unable to add some of the birthday guest's drinks to our bill.   It's all good.  The staff here is very friendly and we were sent on our way with big sincere THANK YOUS.

Model Milk is an amazing place for a romantic night out, a date night, a night with girlfriends, or just a night to yourself with a good book.  The open kitchen atmosphere, the upper area FACING the restaurant are all neat qualities I love about new hot restaurants in Calgary.  Even the bathrooms are cool.

The name drives me nuts, but I'm a HUGE fan.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Good option if you're looking for something different. Great selection of different foods (rabbit mortadella, sweetbreads, blood sausage) and a nice selection of fish entrees - definitely not the standard 'chain restaurant' fare! Everything was very tasty. The place gets pretty noisy when it fills up, but you can still talk with the person seated across from you. It has an intimate feel on the main level but with a bright airy feeling with the open space above Service was quite good as well, they explain what's on your plate when they bring it to you and will find the answer out to a question if they don't know. We had no problem dining within 75 minutes but didn't feel rushed at all. The servers are well groomed, but some of the hostesses were fairly casually dressed. They also had a unique and vast drink menu including some non-alcoholic cocktails. Reservations are recommended, they do also have counter dining upstairs, overlooking the main dining area."}
{"text":"I like!
Model Milk creates a unique twist on traditional dishes. I ordered the Wagyu Short Rib and it was flavorful in all the right ways. Mind you, the cut of beef was very marbled, so for those of you who don't like a fatty meat, then you probably won't enjoy this dish. My friend ordered the Oyster Mushroom vegetarian dish, and it was quite tasty too. The apple juice sage soda is refreshingly sweet.
The service here is excellent, and that's why I give Model Milk a 5 star review. Our server was friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient."}
{"text":"We went to Model Milk for our anniversary.  Our server was Patrick and he was awesome - attentive and knowledgeable.  The pace of the meal was great - we were not rushed even though the restaurant was very busy. My husband's lamb and my trip-tip steak were excellent (the grilled shishito peppers on the steak were a standout!!).  One portion of my husband's lamb was pretty raw so Patrick took it back to the kitchen and made it right - no big deal. Try the stuffed chicken wings for sure.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that the portions are small for the price but the quality was certainly there."}
{"text":"Another gem on 17th avenue in Calgary!  All the little things, as usual for Calgary, are done perfectly - decor, music, menu presentation and organization, drink menu/options, staff, and price was reasonable for what you get.

Got here a half hour early on a Friday night but was able to be seated immediately in the main room, enjoyed the mix of music while we had cocktails.  Food wise got the ox and quail to start which was delicious and a perfect portion for two.  Entrees were the burger and pork with mole sauce, grits, and acorn squash.  Both were awesome, burger was one I will not forget for a long time, up there in best burgers I have had.  The pork portion was big, and cooked so it was nice and tender but with a hard crispy burn on the top layer of fat.  The grits were an interesting and welcome addition to the pork.  Peanut butter cookie ice cream sandwich served as the grand finale and it did not disappoint, this too was a good size for sharing.

For $80 CAD for appetizer, bottle of wine, two entrees and desert you cannot complain for this level of quality and attention to detail - look forward to going back and also trying them out for brunch."}
{"text":"My second time dining - and \"Yay! I'm a fan.\"

There are several reasons Model Milk stands out:

1. Great service. These are pro-level servers. Like the NHL/CFL/PGA level of their sport.

2. The history of that building (with its unique vibe) going back to the early nineties. We dined two meters from the spot I accidentally met Bratt Pitt (and did not realize it) when he was in town filming Legends of the Fall (and this space was a nightclub). It is my understanding, the cast and crew of the Revenant were regulars at Model Milk too. Epic location in those walls.

3. It goes without saying - great food. I dined on the Model burger, which was a little messy but exceptionally tasty. Expect it to melt before you and your fork to become a necessity."}
{"text":"Haven't been in a while but def super yummy.  Especially the eggs. Do not miss the opportunity to try their burger also.  :)"}
{"text":"Model Milk is a relatively new restaurant (est. 2011) on 17th Ave. The space itself is amazing. Modern, inviting with a lot of variety. It has a small patio with a little bar downstairs. Then going up 3 stairs you enter a huge open area, tastefully decorated. You can go up a full flight of stairs to the upstairs dining area, which is overlooking the big open space. There is some bar-like seating and a bunch of tables. Very inviting and fun. Reminds me of some of the hipster restaurants I've been to in New York. One problem was that it was very noisy. We were at a small table with 5 people, 1 on the end, and it was hard to hear the people sitting across the table from you.

The beer list is excellent with a good selection of nice microbrews including a few I had never heard of from Ontario. The menu is small, varied, and distinct with a number of appealing options. The 5 people in my party all ordered something different, independently and there are only maybe 7 large dishes on the menu.

They were offering a nightly special of fish tacos, where they bring a whole sea bass to your table and as many tortillas as you want. It is accompanied by 5 delicious sauces like a sriracha-based sauce, a jalapeno vinaigrette, a pickled cucumber, an avocado \"mousse\" (which seemed to be the same as guacamole to me), and a freshly made tomato salsa. This dish was fantastic, all 5 were delicious. It was meant to be dinner for two, but we ordered it as an appetizer for the whole table of 5, and there was enough fish for us to have about 3 small tacos each. So often with fish tacos the fish itself isn't great, but when they cook you a delicious sea bass (gosh!) and bring it your table, you know it's good.

My wife ordered the macaroni with braised lamb. It wasn't sitting well with her and was quite heavy and hard to eat. I ordered the rainbow trout which was very delicious, with butter lettuce and blue cheese citrus sauce. I really enjoyed mine, but shouldn't have ordered more fish after going for the fish tacos.

Overall, I was fairly impressed but my wife wasn't. The space and distinct menu was compelling enough that we will definitely give it another chance."}
{"text":"A truly stunning dinner.  I live in San Francisco and am surrounded by great restaurants, and this is possibly the best meal I've had in recent memory. 

Highlights:
- calamari appetizer
- sustainable sea bass 
- pork loin 
- lamb entree

... And simply the most stunning cheese platter I've ever had for dessert. Chili-honey pistachios, Stilton, Gouda.  Wow!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the drink menu at this place!  Such unique flavour combinations!   We really enjoyed the enthusiasm of the staff, the server who brought our brisket was as excited about the meat as we were!"}
{"text":"If you care more about your haircut/beard than the quality of your food, or if you have unusually large amounts of cash to throw at average but 'hipped-up' food, or if you *think* you're sophisticated and worldly wise when it comes to food but have secretly never really come to understood what good food is all about, then this place is for you.  I'm reasonably confident in suggesting that on no planet within our galaxy that supports life is it deemed in any way reasonable to charge close to $70 for a lump of brisket, however lovingly or cleverly prepared; a cut that was, until quite recently, regarded as 'poor mans' meat, which goes for pennies in any proper butchers yet to be polluted by the Food Network revolution.  Or $14 for a couple of bits of brioche with a teaspoon of jazzed up crab meat on top.  This place epitomizes for me all that's been going wrong with Calgary food over the past decade or so; as the saying goes, 'money ruins everything' and the fact that Calgary currently enjoys a spate of young people making downright silly money for not very much at all has, I suspect given rise to trendy unremarkanle locations such as this.

To be fair, the food was not bad.  But that's the point.  If you're going to charge this much money, then the food had better be pretty remarkable, and it simply isn't.  Such prices are not justified by spinning dope beats and hip tracks on *actual vinyl* in the background, by having cool hipsters for waiting staff (the beard count was unusually high) or by creating an imaginative and bright menu.  That's all well and good, a bit of trendy fun and perfectly welcome, but at the end of the day, the quality of food simply doesn't justify the exorbitant prices, so while it was fun to visit, I won't be going back."}
