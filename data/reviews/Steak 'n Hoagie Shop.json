{"text":"A really good philly cheese steak with a bunch of different variations, the burgers are also good. Its got a diner atmosphere the food is cooked quickly."}
{"text":"Good cheesesteak with fried onions, true to the philly cheesesteak. Importance is good bread which the owner has for his hoagies and cheesesteaks. The Italian hoagie was also really good and true to the philly kind and meats. Busy place and the owner was patient and nice guy. I gave him props for a good authentic cheesesteak being from Philly."}
{"text":"If you want a great gyro for a cheap price this is your spot. The gyro is stuffed and it is a two fist-er wrap. 

The don't have french fries but they do have other sides to choose from but nothing for my taste. 

From the outside it looks as if this is a place with another restaurant option right next door, until you walk in. 
Then you'll see, both \"restaurants\" are one. You can order anything inside Steak and Hoagie including anything from \"the other restaurant\" menu all at the same counter. 

As a matter of fact the \"other restaurant\" Grecos menu, is where I ordered my gyro from. I got my $4.75 moneys worth in this gyro. 

So why am I leaving the review for Grecos menu here under Steak and Hoagie? Because that's the door I walked in and then out of. And, they used the Steak and Hoagie logo wrap for my Gyro.
Confused yet?"}
{"text":"Went here with my wife and daughter over the weekend. We've been searching for a local place where we could get cheesesteaks and sandwiches like we used to get back in NJ/NY. This place met out expectations greatly. First, you gotta have a good roll. The cheese steaks my wife and I got were awesome, rolls were chewy and soft and the steak meat was grilled perfectly. The fries were great and my daughter, who's very picky, devoured her chicken fingers. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Friendly, Super food!!  My husband & I lived in Crete, Greece for 3 years and  this so close to the Greek food I had to make sure I was still in North Carolina.  Wish I could give it more stars!!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in South Charlotte. Quick and convenient from either South Park or Uptown. Great service. Lunch was served within 5 minutes of ordering. I recommend to all."}
{"text":"The best location of the best place to get a cheese steak in Charlotte area. Fresh backed bread daily, try the New Jersey cheese steak. One of the best things I've ever put in my mouth!"}
{"text":"Fantastic hoagies! Fries are crisp and the service is quick. Thank god it's by the school!"}
{"text":"Got the New Jersey Philly cheesesteak, it was good but nothing special. The bread was soft but the steak was kind of dry and not enough cheese. I also got a side of the potatoes to try out, it had a hint of lemon/oil/vinegar taste to it. It was nice and hot but nothing special either."}
{"text":"We so love your Greek Salad w/ Grilled Chicken. It is the bomb."}
{"text":"Solid cheesesteak place with some pretty good hoagies as well.  A tad bit pricey, but damn good none the less.  My biggest recommendation is the Steak Au Jus.  That's right a delicious cheesesteak with onions and a cup of au jus to dip that bad boy in.  Absolute nummers my man, absolute nummers."}
{"text":"First, congrats to them for still being open! The location is cursed and nothing seems to last. Yesterday was my first visit and I will be back. I had a basic philly cheesesteak with a greek salad & soda for the low price of $7 (and some change). They offer a nice variety of items, the employees were nice & my food was ready in less than 10 minutes. Was it the best philly I've had, no, but it was very good and I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Excellent cheesesteak and good nana pudding. Expensive pudding for the amount you get but the price/value of the sand which is excellent. Also they have Cheerwine which is a must for me."}
{"text":"Came across this establishment by chance as we were seeking a place to have lunch.  The Greek salad was delicious, though not for those who do not care for cucumbers.  (They use a tomato/cucumber/feta salad in a vinaigrette and add it to the bed of lettuce.). The gyro was very good, as well, and my son very much enjoyed the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich he had.  We expect to return in the future when we are in this area."}
{"text":"I work close by & eat here 5-6 times per month, super friendly. Great food, lots of variety, aside from subs, they have burgers, fried seafood, & salads. My favorite is the grilled chicken pita wrap, awesome."}
{"text":"Deliscious, fresh! So good. Love the regular and chicken cheesesteaks. Really nice people too."}
{"text":"Overall not a bad steak sandwich, the French fries can use a little help.  Price was fair and the size of the sandwich was perfect."}
{"text":"Great cheesesteaks at an amazing value. They check all the boxes... good bun, shredded and peppered beef, cheese perfectly melted, and grilled onions. Perfection!"}
{"text":"YAY FOR THEIR GREEK SALAD WITH CHICKEN!!!    Their salad is probably one of the best that I've ever had.  My husband brought one home for me, and my first instinct was to grab a knife and fork to cut it up.  I USUALLY have to cut salads into bite-size pieces since most restaurants tend to serve them with huge pieces of lettuce - but not this time.  No knife was necessary for anything...not even the chicken pieces on top - which were plentiful.  Also, I love feta cheese, so I was happy that they use small chunks of feta rather than crumbles of it.  To me, crumbles of feta cheese just don't taste as good as small chunks.   The cucumber slices were even decorative looking rather than just plain sliced.  This tells me that they really care about the appearance of their finished product.  The greek dressing was also good.   My only wish for the Matthews/Indian Trail location is that they had the Greco menu option that their other locations do."}
{"text":"$15.97. That's my tab for dinner here once or twice per month. You can dine in, but I always order to-go. Two gyro's and a gyro greek salad. Location is convenient at the intersection of South Blvd & Canton in a small strip mall. Food is awesome, quick and hot! I enjoy the gyro better than Greek Isles. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is great if you need some really good food on go.  Although I should say that the sandwiches can be a little messy sometimes, so maybe it's not so much an on- the- go food.  Either way, the food here is really tasty.  The bread is baked fresh and the meats and cheeses taste like the high quality stuff.  The people here are really nice and pretty quick too, which is nice.  Also this particular location shares space with another restaurant, so if you are with someone who wants something else to eat, you are covered."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall place.  Have gotten gyros in two occasions.  Always hot and fresh.  Great service too."}
{"text":"I especially love their fries as it is crispy the way that I like it! I have had the Bigfoot Burger which was quite filling."}
{"text":"The best subs in town. Fresh breads and ingredients prepared by great sandwich engineer.  The fried fish and shrimp ain't bad either."}
{"text":"The Black and Blue Cheesesteak with added banana peppers was delicious! A great find on our way from Asheville to Oak Island."}
{"text":"Amazing hoagie bread. Top notch service. Good value. The kids split an adult 13\" Italian. It was just what you'd want in an Italian. The baby had chicken strips which were as good as you could hope for. I had a cheese steak supreme that was just OK. The cheese and toppings were great. The meat was tender but a tad bland. 

The waitress was very helpful and even had the forethought to bring an extra plate since my kids were sharing. 

The sides were the surprise here. Expecting only fries but had a real fruit salad, and pretty darn good green beans (the waitress was spot on, good but needs a touch of salt).

Definitely will be coming back soon to try another hoagie soon."}
{"text":"Their hoagies are awesome. I like the Black and Blue AND Italian are my favorites. The chicken plates are great too with their rice and spinach or other sides. The customer service is always great. And the tea is delicious. I'm always in and out when I go."}
{"text":"Just started going here. Was recommended to me by a friend. I've had the Texas sandwich and shrimp po boy. They gave daily specials which are awesome. Food is delicious, fast, and piping hot. Fries are that crispy kind that have a great crunch. Great place for lunch, but I went there for dinner the other night (not as many people so it felt almost like a private chef feeling). I can't wait to try the other items on the menu- looking forward to the Greek bowls. The people that work there are nice and really seem to care that you enjoyed your meal and got everything you wanted. New favorite!"}
{"text":"Wow! This place is awesome!! Great fish and shrimp and hoagies. The salads are good too. The bread is so fresh. The employees are so nice and friendly. What a wonderful place for Stallings!! I'll be back over and over again ."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try after passing on it various times. I have to say that I am pretty happy. The folks in the office made the lunch run, so I can't comment on the service. But I can say that my sandwich was pretty damn good. 
I went for the Italian, and added bacon because, well it's bacon.
I only did the 7\" version. Every thing was solid, from the bread to the ingredients. They didn't skimp. I had them add oil /vinegar..... they went a little heavy on it, but for me that's fine.
The prices are decent too, so this won't be my last visit here...... as long as I am still working in this area. LOL"}
{"text":"Like a good cheesesteak?  This is a damn fine choice!
I stopped here for a lunch based on an email recommendation, and was not a bit disappointed!  Great meat to cheese and veggie ratios and it was perfectly seasoned!  Prices were great, service was awesome and food came out hot, accurate and pretty quick.  I will definitely be back any time I'm even close to Matthews, NC!!"}
{"text":"Oh steak and hoagie how I love you for not being over the top.  $4 for a banging gyro and $6 for an awesome sub. What more can you want?  This place is perfect for lunch and is never really packed."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The service is great and fast. The food selection is huge and I have yet to try something I don't like. 

I go to Steak'n Hoagie about once a week. They are super affordable and if you are a big meat person you're going to love how far your dollar gets you. 

I have nothing but great things to say about this place. From their huge menu all the way down to their lemon juice or Texas Pete's hot sauce condiment packets Steak 'n Hoagie has nailed it if your looking for a fast, cheap and delicious meal."}
{"text":"Lunch on the run. Was heading towards Chick-Fil-A and saw The Steak 'n Hoagie Shop. Had to make a pit stop thinking of NYC and Philly Cheese Steak. Went for the Gyro Combo instead.

Love- Love- Love the Gyro and the potato side item. What was so amazing the Gyro was not greasy at all. Fresh pita bread. No heartburn. What a relief!!! 

Definitely coming back for the Philly Cheese Steak next time I am in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Two thumbs up!! Great heros! Pasta salad I love!!! My fiancé brings me home the pasta salad when he goes! I get off work and love this treat!! Sandwhich are good, bread is soft, great pork chops, and the fries are delish! Love this place! You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I am from Philly and have been searching for something that even comes close to a Philly Cheese Steak down here for 4 years and have been consistantly disappointed. My search has ended. Can it be as great as a Philly Cheese Steak IN PHILLY?? That is asking a lot.....but this is very very close. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I had the Philly and it was really good.  Burgers are really good and the onion rings are the best I've had in a long while.  We will Definitely be coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"The cheesesteak is really awesome and I love the pasta salad. Prices are very reasonable and the employees are always friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent friendly service with really good hoagies, fries and onion rings!"}
{"text":"So my car breaks down and I decide to visit this place . The menu has a lot to pick from and I asked the lady at the register what's good and she recommended the roasted chicken . So I got the roasted chicken with the potatoes and cabbage, the meal came with garlic bread. The cabbage was so good and chicken was moist and well seasoned. But the potatoes were okay I think it's the oil they cook the potatoes that gave them a funny taste. Overall I ate everything on my plate and the employees were very nice and welcoming. I wish I could come back and try their gyros and other sandwiches."}
{"text":"GREAT portion sizes for the price. 13 inch subs are around 7$. Great food, the smell is amazing, and it's a quick place to stop and get some lunch! I got my sub in around 5 minutes. 
I'll definitely be back for the Gyros and their Greek chicken salads!"}
{"text":"I love its fries and it is crisp. I usually get the tuna hoagie and if you get the large size it is enough for two people. The lady who takes care of my order is super nice and the service is fast too. The steak and cheese hoagie is also good. If you are in the area definitely give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"After reading Todd's review, I bookmarked this place. I tend to trust Todd's judgement in food so I knew it would be a good time.

And it was. A great cheesesteak made to order. I chose the \"black and blue\" which had a decent amount of blue cheese dressing on it plus lettuce and tomato and onions and peppers. Not exactly \"Philly\" traditional, but who cares? It tasted excellent. And priced right!

They have a Pepsi fountain and one of the buttons dispenses soda water. This is a plus for me.

And bonus! They have free wifi!

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Couldnt finish what was a terrible cheese steak even for charlottes standards let alone philly"}
{"text":"Classic  Steak n Cheeses.  I'm a big fan of their Chicken Cheesesteak. Local joint feel with other items like Burgers, Fish and Gyros, if not in the mood for S&C."}
{"text":"Finally tried it after reading a review online. Awesome!! Easy to miss in a strip mall. Cheese steaks were hot and great. Fresh ingredients and good sized, especially for the price. The gyro was awesome too, one of the best in Charlotte. Cheap no nonsense place with great sandwiches."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today and got a Philly Cheesesteak.  I think a better name for this place would be Steam 'um Hoagie Shop.  Tasted like steam 'em sandwich meat (or something else similarly expensive and non-steak like.)  I thought with a name like Steak 'n Hoagie it would (should?) be a good steak sandwich.  Next time I will just go to Jersey Mike's.  There's is awesome.  Can't speak to anything else on the menu here although there was quite a variety.  Thought I was going with a safe choice.  You've been warned.  :-)"}
{"text":"Great food, served hot!

Shop is clean, and staff is very nice as well!

I had the 7\" Black and Blue which was very good.
My girlfriend had the 7\" New Jersey and she said it was excellent as well."}
{"text":"Haven't stopped in here in a while. Went in today and food was fantastic as it always is. Greek salad with chicken is great. Large potion, both salad and chicken. Great prices too, $8 for the salad.  

The place is clean and the people are friendly.   May be crowded at lunch but well worth it."}
{"text":"Good tasting cheesesteak. Good fries. VERY friendly staff. Clean and pleasant. Shop was busy and people were ordering everything from the menu, which is indicative of the consistency of the quality of the food."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. I've never heard of it until a few coworkers wanted to come here. It can definitely get packed around lunch time. Service is good and food came out quickly. I've gotten several sandwiches here. They were all good as well as the pasta salad. My coworker loves their pork chops. Prices are cheap and they do daily specials!"}
{"text":"No, this isn't a new restaurant.  For 30 years, east Charlotte enjoyed the Steak 'n Hoagie Shop and due to roadwork, they have found a new home in Stallings...and I'm grateful.  

I would drive by the Burger Shop and think maybe but it never had enough cars out front for me to go inside.  That closed, the building looked dilapidated but one day, it opened as Kavkaz.  Every time I drove by Kavkaz, I thought of that Seinfeld when Jerry convinced Babu to open a Pakistani restaurant that failed.  I think he was deported or something...I loved that show.  

Anyway, the Steak 'n Hoagie Shop opened and its doing very well.  

I tried just a regular cheesesteak along with the onion rings and I must say, I'm impressed.  Since I've been down here, I have yet to have a really great cheesesteak (had a couple good ones, lots of someone's interpretation of a philly) until now.  Everything was very good and even the onion rings were great.  I look forward to going back and being more adventurous with my order.  The only disappointment is that I wish they had fried mushrooms but oh well."}
{"text":"This place rocks! The guy who took my order was super patient even though the restaurant was crazy busy, didn't make me feel rushed. I picked up steak and au jus, meatball sub, black and blue and a gyro for my guys. All the sandwiches came out sized right and the guys commented repeatedly how good they were. We crushed our food and are ready for naps! 

If you're looking for a fast sandwich that comes out as promised - there's no better option!!

If I have to find something negative to comment so I don't seem like a bot I will say that the gyro was a little small? Get two! The prices are just right.

See you soon guys!"}
{"text":"I think it's time for another poem, dedicated to the really nice people and delicious food at this Steak 'n Hoagie location:

Hello, gyro my hero - I missed you so,
If I didn't have pants to fit into, I would never let you go. 

With salads, sandwiches and cheesesteaks too,
This Steak 'n Hoagie shop is my new boo. 

So, go on and grab a $4.20 gyro pita,
I promise it will make you purr like a cheetah."}
{"text":"Quick, very tasty, filling and great for a fast lunch at any day.  Lots of variety to choose from, whether it be salad or gyro...I recommend and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Horrible service the employees where too busy staring at customers then focusing on the food. I told them the cherry soda was out to replace it and all they said was ok and continued to ignore it. We had to send our food back bc they didn't get our order right and the meat and onions weren't fully cooked ... And it wasn't even busy unacceptable !!!!"}
{"text":"Again we were impressed with what we ordered at the Steak and Hogie Place in Indian Trail NC. I ordered the Gyro and the husband had the steak Hogie. It was awesome as usual. I love this place. We have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is average to good-onion rings were good-they use Vidalia -super sweet. Chicken pita was good-the dill  sauce was not-authentic tziki would have been much better. Shared banana pudding for dessert-to be fair it was after 7 pm but it definitely was left over from lunch and pulled out of refrig. the surrounding Nilla wafers were soggy. 

Casual place, parking lot"}
{"text":"The best sandwich shop around and is a very popular lunch spot. My go to order is the New Jersey sandwich with fries. Fries are always cooked perfectly with a nice crunch to them and the sandwich is delicious. all of this served up to you by some friendly folks."}
{"text":"This is the only location I have ever tried, because I used to work nearby.  It has always been good each time I have had lunch or dinner.  There is never a wait, sometimes lunch can get busy though.  

The staff is friendly.  After you order and pay at the counter, they bring you food out to you.  They also have a carry out window for drive up service.

The shop is small but clean.  The bathrooms aren't the greatest, so I would try to avoid if possible.  

Recommend the black & blue hoagie or the pork chop dinner! The pork chop is my favorite.  It's delicious each time.  It comes with 2 sides.  Onion rings are good.  Cole slaw, could be better.  I've never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place.  I lived in Philadelphia for 10 years and have been looking for a good authentic cheesesteak.  This regrettably fell short.   The place is clean and the service is friendly.  Portion size for the price was quite reasonable.  

On one hand, they get it.  A Philly cheesesteak should be meat, cheese and onion and that is what they offer.  The meat however should, quite honestly, be greasier.  That combined with there not being enough cheese made for a dry sandwich.  The meat also had a seasoning to it, maybe rosemary, that just really had no place on a cheesesteak.  The roll it was served on was excellent, a rarity in the charlotte area.  

They had a nice selection of sides, but didn't have French fries which was really what a good cheesesteak should be paired with.

This is not a bad place and maybe my expectations were too high.  All in all I was hoping for a taste of home and it just fell short."}
{"text":"3.5 stars to be exact.  

I have been told by a coworker to give this place a try.  He spoke highly of it but didn't elaborate. I thought... Just hoagie, can't be that fabulous.  When I stopped by for a hurried lunch to go, I was surprised that it's not just hoagie.  In fact I didn't see anyone ordering a hoagie.  There was roast chicken, and gyro, and veggies, and yes, sandwiches (or hoagies).  And the best part was it was cheap!  I had a 1/4 chicken and 2 veggies and a side of garlic toast for less than $5 with tax.  Service was ok.  I got my food in a few minutes. Man, I was so excited all the way back to my office.  

Here comes the star deduction.  Everything looked great and smelled great yet tasted a little bland.  It wasn't bad by any means, it just smelled so darn good.  I was hoping the food would be kicking good.

There will be next time, and I will follow suit and try the gyro.  I am glad to have stopped in last week... Cheap and semi healthy lunch options are limited and this will be one in the area."}
{"text":"A great takeout spot for cheese steak fans. Surprisingly the best thing they offer is a huge and delicious Greek salad with grilled chicken and feta. Can feed two people, delicious and very filling!"}
{"text":"This place has really good sandwiches. The fries and onion rings were great also. The chicken cheese steak was really good as well. I will definitely be back to this cute little spot."}
{"text":"Im from Philly...lots of experience with cheese steaks and hoagies....have in nc sc for 20 years..this is the best sandwhich had in all that time!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Fast service and very affordable. Cheesesteak hoagies are the best!"}
