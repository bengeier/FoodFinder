{"text":"Ive been waiting for this spot to open and it did not disappoint.  Food and atmosphere are outstanding! Concept is Indian fast casual.  You order at counter then your food it brought out.  Menu has so many choices that look amazing....I will definitely be back to try more!  I also like the element of Indian mixed with Southern (okra fries, Carolina wrap).   I had the Tikka Masala with chicken.  Very flavorful with good heat that wasn't overwhelming.  Comes with a side of rice (I had saffron) and naan.  Chicken was very tender and marinated.  I also had to try the okra fries and they were a favorite.  Great flavor, crispy and very lightly fried...way more healthy than French fries.  The mango lassi was outstanding.  I never knew I needed okra fries or mango lassi in my life..so that's why this place is so great.   The space is modern but comfortable.  Lots of space and tables inside and out on the patio.  I like the open kitchen and spice room to the left of the counter.  Service and staff were top notch.    Great addition to Charlotte dining scene!  Lots of craveable food and great atmosphere.  I think it could become the next Viva Chicken or Sabor with multiple locations."}
{"text":"If you do not eat Indian Food regularly, it can be quite intimidating to order. Tandur completely takes away this intimidation!!  We arrived on a Saturday lunch time and it was pretty busy. However we were able to get through the line and get our food within about 20 minutes.  My husband and I decided on the chicken tikka misala and lamb kabobs. I love that the kitchen has glass windows as you can see the cooks cooking naan and sauces. The chicken tikka masala was very creamy....not very spicy at all for those that are spice adverse. The lamb kabobs were definitely a highlight. Perfectly cooked and the mint chutney with it was a great pairing!   Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"Biryani was on edge of better  spicy  Vs. spicy  Naan bread was pre-baked and that was disappointing  Chicken Tikka Masala was ok but lacked Indian aroma  Samosa was perfect."}
{"text":"Tandur has done a really great job of bringing together food from multiple parts of India. The flavors are very authentic and the staff are so attentive and helpful!! We tried the wings and chicken kebabs. The wings were so tender and delicious!! We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Don't listen to the other people who think you can't have good Indian food quickly. This place is great. The owner is always there to greet people and help out. Yes, it is a similar setup to other fast-casual dining but why is that a bad thing? The food comes out quickly from their big tandoori ovens and everything I've had is delicious. The Naanchos are a must. An Indian twist on Nachos that you won't regret."}
{"text":"I have been eagerly looking forward to the opening of Tandur for month. Ordered takeout online today, starting with something simple, namely chicken tikka masala, basmati rice, and naan. After tax, it was around $11.  On the whole, I would rate this 3.5 stars but am rounding up to 4 since it's the first week.  The food was not much different from what one might find at a typical Indian restaurant.  What I liked = (1) most importantly, the flavor of the tikka masala sauce was very good as was the rice, and chicken was very tender; (2) the order was ready as soon as I walked in, 2 minutes head of the promised time; (3) the place looked clean and modern, though I did not eat there.    What I liked less = (1) the portion was on the small side, not tiny but not very filling for the price; (2) the sauce, though flavorful, was the thinnest I've ever seen (have eaten at about 30 Indian restaurants in 6-7 states), almost watery; (3) the naan was not bad but was very thin and lacked much flavor, unlike the thicker chewy naan offered at most other places; (4) a small sharp bone fragment around the size of a grain of rice was still in the chicken, which I luckily caught before swallowing; (5) although I ordered takeout, there was no cutlery or even napkins in my bag (and their lack was not mentioned when I picked up the bag).  This would have been annoying if I had needed to eat on the run or somewhere those items weren't available.    All in all, it was a pretty good start. As a point of comparison, Trader Joe's has a very good chicken tikka masala frozen meal, which costs about $4 and is not that different.  Tandur's meal was roughly the same size, perhaps a bit larger (plus naan), and the flavor was about the same, perhaps a bit better.  So for $11, I don't think I'll be eating here every day, but may swing by once every month or so."}
{"text":"For once there is an Indian restaurant without cheesy decor, like good restaurants in India. However the food is Americanized which I think is needed if you want to appeal to a wider American clientele. I am an Indian with a low tolerance for spicy food but the food here is really mild, so would not recommend it to my Indian friends but definitely to the non-Indian friends. I think the ambience of a restaurant is important and Tandur has it."}
{"text":"I loved the large windows which gave you a clear view of the tandoori ovens, naan prep, spices, and meat selections. Now let's get to the part that really matters, the GRUUUUUUB!  For my entree I ordered the following:  Vindaloo with Lamb Meatballs: you get 4 tiny meatballs, which I mean, I understand that it's lamb, but come on. I spooned those tiny meatballs into halves so I could make it last. The spicy level was nice, but the meatballs were super...Ã¼ber..DRY. Also, the sauce was way too watery. I'm used to the more thick, rich, reduced Indian gravies that rest on top of the rice, not pooling on the bottom. The flavor of the Vindaloo gravy itself was lacking depth and salt.   Garlic Naan-it was cool to watch the naan being prepared, however, the garlic flavor wasn't prominent. It tasted like plain naan.  As appetizers we enjoyed the the Kale Pakura, Tanduri Wings, and the Spiced Okra fries.  Kale Pakura-these were super crispy, yet light, fritter type situations. The flavors weren't very strong, but were balanced. This dish needed the accompaniment of a sauce, such as the tamarind chutney. This was an ok appetizer.   Tanduri Chicken Wings-tasty wings with a nice char. It's interesting, I'm used to the charred aspect of wings being created by baking, broiling, and grilling, so the taste and crispy bits that were created by the heat of the tandoori oven offered a completely different flavor profile. Because these were served on a platter I didn't get the entire fresh out of the oven experience. I'm sure that would elevate it completely. Give it a try.  Okra Fries- Yummy. I personally love every aspect of okra. Because the fries were cut thinly then fried, they were nice and light, however they weren't seasoned. This dish is a great way for those who don't particularly like okra, to experience it in a way they can enjoy.  Overall the experience was OK. I have had some phenomenal dishes at other Indian restaurants such as Tamarind, Aroma Indian Cuisine and Persis Indian Grill and, unfortunately, Tandur Indian Kitchen does not measure up to the \"knock your socks off\" experiences I've had at those eateries."}
{"text":"Since I went in on a Friday at lunch, a week after opening, the place was busy. But the line moved fairly quickly and the women working the registers were friendly. I sat and waited for my food for about 10 minutes, which to me is longer than most restaurants of this style, but it was worth it. $18 for a meal, side and drink to me is a little bit pricy but luckily I got a couple of meals out of it. I got the chicken biryani bowl with vegetables on the side. Some of the better indian I have had in the area and the place is brand new and clean. I would recommend Tandur even if it requires a short drive."}
{"text":"If you ever had Indian food in past or know what Indian food actually is avoid this place!!!!! Food has absolutely no taste to it. We ordered Paneer Tikka masala and it tasted more like tomato soup with cream in it. Also they definitely pre make all good. By the time we placed an order and went to our seat food was already there. Coming from someone that eats Indian food every week... I have to say by far one the worst Indian food I ever had!!!! Save your self trouble and don't go to this place."}
{"text":"I have been anxiously awaiting this opening for months since I first saw the signs and read about it online.  The wait was well worth it.  I eat in this shopping center several times a week and Tandur is a great addition to the rotation.  We arrived for a quick work lunch shortly after 11:00 to find no wait.  Service was prompt and helpful.  I already knew what I wanted so I did not try the various sauces they offered.  There is ample seating and the restaurant feels nice and open.  My chicken tikka masala arrived after a very short wait.  The portion was impressive and the colors looked amazing.  It had just the right amount of chicken and rice.  Right away I was a bit put off by the naan being buttered or something similar.  Though it was still crispy the texture was a bit messier than I hoped.  The flavors were great and I was very pleased with the food.  It seemed like they are setup for less adventurous diners as they have seasoning by the drinks if you want to spice up the dish.  My tikka masala had good flavor but no heat.    Other than the buttery/oily naan, I was disappointed the food was not as hot (temperature) as I would have expected.  They had only been open for 10 minutes so the food could not have sat around too long.  It arrived to the table a little warm but not hot.  Maybe it's a personal preference.  In any event I already have my next meal picked out and a few other coworkers lined up to try it next week.  I am excited for the new addition to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian food with authentic flavors adapted to the American market. Not sure what to order? Check out the touch screen for an introduction to their menu item and what ingredients they use. I'd recommend the Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Kabobs, and Chicken Samosas! Will be back."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to checking out this spot.. wasn't our favorite.. I have a favorite 'fast' Indian restaurant I like to go to in the Triangle... small location, but everything is fresh, and great variety (so this is what I'm comparing it too, sorry).  Would love to see some different options... maybe some chana chaat :)   Wouldn't go out of my way to stop here, but would/will give it another try when the menu changes up a bit with some more options.   The people were friendly :)"}
{"text":"I was a little bit taken aback when I came in because I've never experienced \"fast\" Indian food before. I was very pleasantly surprised.   Try the mango lassi! Perfect cool and sweet balance to a savory and spicy meal. The veggie samosas and the naan were delicious. I also ordered the coconut and spiced curry with chicken and enjoyed every bite.   For the less adventurous eaters, the chicken kebab was a delicious choice that my more bland friends enjoyed. ;)   I would definitely come back my next time in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"It was really closer to a 3, just not there yet.  Cashier did not have much personality, but maybe because it was very busy on a Sunday afternoon. Looked larger on the outside and despite the sign's request, saw parties holding tables. *Shrugs*  I totally agree with a few others that the Tikka Masala is quite off.  To me, it tasted like it had a base of Campbell's Tomato, no bueno.  Was not the spices and a hint of heat that I am used to. Could have been a rushed batch? Tried the  Herbal Ginger Lemonade (green one) and it was refreshing, just had to add ice to it. It too must have been just been made.  Wish it was a little larger since no refills for the price. Similarly priced Viva's has a larger cup.  The garlic naan was also not very garlicky, so much so that I asked the server for confirmation. All in all, I think I will return again and try something different with hopes of a different outcome."}
{"text":"Just tried this place! I will have to say the food is great with options for everyone. They let you try the sauces before you order. The samosas a really good too. Everyone who works there is very knowledgeable and helpful as well! This place is a must try."}
{"text":"Loved it. Ordered the chicken tikka with basmati rice and a side of naan. Chicken samosas had a generous amount of chicken. I like putting lemon on my curry. Service was very helpful and attentive. Atmosphere was very different but nice. Went back later for their special dessert cookie and Peruvian chocolate brownie. Food is non gmo, cage free. Very fast service."}
{"text":"Oh dear, am I in trouble... absolutely DELICIOUS!!! Chicken Tikka Masala, saffron basmati rice and garlic naan... not sharing, get your own! Customer service was excellent as I was greeted at the door and offered guidance to the new setup and menu. Friendly, welcoming and I was easily talked into the mango smoothie (which was delightfully refreshing after yoga). Without a doubt my favorite addition to the South Park neighborhood. Thanks, Tandur!"}
{"text":"Overall Tandur was a fun experience due to the creative food, fun space, and attentive staff. I certainly would come back again with friends.  The day my wife and I went it was a Saturday around lunch time. For whatever reason, we apparently beat the crowd as we walked right up to the register, which wasn't the case when we left. The space is bright and I love the glass walls to the kitchen so you can watch them cook the meats in their tall and colorful clay ovens.  We didn't have a problem grabbing a seat even though the place was full thanks to an attentive wait staff busing the tables. We ordered the chicken tikka misala and lamb kabobs which came out quicker than I expected. I will say (as others have hilighted in their reviews) that the food does not have that same spice kick that you would come to expect at a traditional Indian restaurant. Rather than dock them for this, I kind of like how they have made this a bit more approachable and the flavor profiles are still very good. If you want a spice \"kick to the teeth\" I would recommend going elsewhere.   Overall it's a welcome addition to a fast growing food destination area. I hope they can keep it up!"}
{"text":"Bland.. Three stars because my friend's lamb kebab was flavorful. If you're trying Indian cuisine for the first time, this is the place for you. Below mild spice levels and light seasoning.  Tikka Masala sauce tastes like nothing but tomatoes. My other friend had the salmon and said it was bland and needed salt.  Chai needs more masala and mango lassi is thin and watery.  Naan was very tasty!!  I'll stick with Chapaati."}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this. It's a fast casual place so it was a nice, chill place for a low-key Monday dinner. I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly and knowledgeable the staff was. The food arrived quickly and was very tasty. Good for kids and probably groups too."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a lunch here not too long after they opened.  She had one of the curries with lamb and I had the wings.   Both were served fresh and packed some great Indian flavors.   Not sure how frequent we will go,  but it was definitely a good first visit"}
{"text":"Visited Tandur on Saturday night around 9:30. Parking was easy that time of night. When we walked in, the restaurant was still busy even though it closed at 10pm but there were plenty of open tables. Since the restaurant is new, be prepared to be patient in line as customers dissect the menu.   I ordered the chicken Tikka Masala and my friend ordered the steak kebabs. The restaurant was unfortunately out of lamb (understandable on opening weekend). It took about 15 minutes for our food to arrive to the table. The chicken Kebabs had a nice spice to it, but the dish itself was lackluster and felt like it was missing something.   My order, the Tikka Masala, was just okay. The sauce itself tasted a little off but the chicken had a nice texture. I found the dish came with plenty of rice, and 3 triangles of naan. I personally found the naan a little chewy and \"wet\" with oil and butter. I initially had been tempted to try the \"naanchos\" but wonder how they would hold up with toppings if they bread is so soggy already.    Overall, Tandur has a great price point and is a good quick fix for an Indian food craving. I think there are better alternatives in Charlotte for Indian if you're looking for a more authentic vibe and taste. I'd like to come back and try a wrap sometime, and to try the lamb."}
{"text":"I liked it! We had the coconut chicken sauce dinner, the kadai chicken, the chicken kabob and wings. There were 4 of us. I liked the kadai best. It had some heat but still flavorful. My children loved the wings and kabob. My husband's dish was not as flavorful as is the norm for Indian dishes. Also, the mango lassi was delish!"}
{"text":"We see its a new place and next to Yafo ! After having at Yafo , decided to try Indian next day but alas it was a big disappointment . We ordered chicken kabab, chicken kadhai, chicken biryani . Firstly Chicken was too dry and secondly every chicken dish had the same grilled chicken in it . Mango lassi did not taste good and other vegetarian dishes were also pretty much OK ! Presentation and ambience is good but wish food could be little more closer to India as the name ."}
{"text":"I am so excited to welcome Tandur to Charlotte.  The food is great and the atmosphere is awesome.  My go to is typically the Tikka Masala w/ paneer,  but the Saag is also delicious.  I look forward to trying the Coconut Curry next, and eventually working my way down the sauce list. I never go without ordering the fried okra, I didn't even know I liked okra, but this stuff is amazing. I also love that the menu lists what is gluten free so you don't have to ask. I think I've eaten here at least once a week since hey opened. Tandur is a great additional to Southpark and Charlotte."}
{"text":"I never thought I'd see a fast food style Indian restaurant but nonetheless that's what we have here with Tandur.  No doubt many millennials will eat here and feel exotic as they proudly tell their instagram friends how much they love Indian food. Sorry to burst the bubble but this is not real Indian food. Now don't get me wrong, this is closer to the real thing than I could make at home but that's not saying a lot considering the wide range of spices necessary for authentic Indian cuisine. But why would you go to Tandur when they are far better more authentic options in the Charlotte area? Maybe this would be a good place for someone who's intimidated by real Indian food. Tandur could serve as training wheels for the uninitiated as long as the eater understands that it gets much better out there. On to the actual food. You are not given the opportunity to choose a specific spice level so I chose the spiciest option, vindaloo with chicken as my protein. When I asked about increasing my level of spice, I was told that there were extra spices by the napkins. Turned out to be some chili powder in a salt shaker.  My wife's vegetable masala was bland. We both had the garlic naan. Mine was much more buttery but both were too thin. We both had the jasmine rice and it was dry. A nice Indian beer would've brought the star level up to 3 but alas, there was none to be had. I guess if you've always wanted to try Indian cuisine but have always been intimated and maybe you needed something quick so that you could get back to your mall shopping, this might be an okay choice for you. Otherwise seek elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am a hugeeeeeee Indian fan and this was not it for me. It truly is equivalent to what chipotle is for authentic Mexican food. There was no flavor there was no spice and also limited options as to the dishes you could choose. The environment was nice and you can tell how much thought they put into the decor but I wish they would put that much thought into the actual tasteeee of the food as well. I ordered the veggie samosas and veggie vindaloo(really regret this). My boyfriend and I love the spice aspect and can typically take the heat with any food, however when we asked if the dishes could be altered to be spicier(which you can do at most Indian restaurants) the cashier told us we could not and that they had some type of pepper powder that we could add ourselves. The presentation was nice but I felt bamboozled after actually eating the food. When we left we were still hungry and went to Cowfish instead. What honestly saved the place for me was the great customer service."}
{"text":"I read a review in The Observer and had high hopes.    On a positive note, everyone is extremely nice.    As a vegetarian, Indian is always a good bet for me and I've rarely been disappointed.   But my vegetarian coconut curry was barely passable.   I've had much better frozen Amy's meals for half the price.   My dish had very few vegetables and they were not fresh.   It was more like a canned vegetable soup with a few Indian spices.   I don't know what the sauce was but it lacked any flavor. So sad but I won't be back."}
{"text":"I couldn't wait to try this trendy new Indian restaurant in South Park. I find the concept similar to Yafo.  The place has a fairly nice ambience, which is somewhere in between fast food and casual dining. Very friendly and attentive staff. I ordered the Tikka Masala, saffron rice and garlic naan which came with pickled onions. I also ordered the Veggie Samosas. The samosas came out first which was nice. They were absolutely delicious! The filling was very moist and they were packed full! Pastry was flakey and better than any other Indian restaurant. The samosas came with two dipping sauces, both of which were excellent. As for the Tikka Masala, while I thought the sauce was quite good as was the consistency I would agree with other reviews that it was a bit on the bland side. It definitely could've had more flavor. I would definitely agree with other reviewer's that the chicken is very VERY dry and chewy!!! I opted for the garlic naan because I like a little more flavor and I would say this is the worst naan I have ever had. There wasn't a hint of garlic that I could detect and the bread was very dry, unlike what you would most often get at other Indian restaurants. I am hoping that they will address the issues of the dry chicken and produce a better naan. After all, they are a brand new restaurant and they deserve a chance to improve! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm!!! Sooo flavorful. The Naanchos with chicken were a flavor explosion, the mango lassi was so good, and the paneer was sooooo tasty. Fast and super friendly service!"}
{"text":"Fast casual, we gotta go fast. We got people to see, places to go to, errands to run, dogs to groom and pianos to deliver. Everything's gotta be fast casual now! I for one am glad for a quick way to get my Indian fix in a hurry. While I don't frequent the Southpark area as often as I used to, I'll make the rounds every once in awhile to explore this menu more.  Fair warning: The parking... just add like 5 minutes to your lunchtime estimate. I got lucky by grabbing one of the parallel spots near the restaurant, but in the process I got dirty looks by two people behind me that acted like their name was on it, Good luck!  Inside, the colors are, well, one man's \"modern\" is another man's \"wacky.\" I was somewhat distracted by the yellow and pink, but that's just like, my opinion! I really like some of the tile work and the huge window looking into the tandoori oven area is awesome. I arrived around 11am right when they opened, so no surprise that everything was spic and span!  If you're vaguely familiar with Indian cuisine then you'll probably see a thing or two on the menu that you'll gravitate towards. If not, the staff is as friendly as can be and can help you out. They really want you to get something you'll like and have no problem simplifying the choices and answering any questions you have. Myself, I'm a sucker for a good Chicken Tikka Masala (who isnt'?) and had my mind made up within a few minutes.  Served with basmati rice and some garlic naan, it came out super quick. Chicken was very satisfying and seasoned well. The masala sauce had a bit of heat to it, but I was craving the dynamic spice profile that truly great masala dishes have. By no means was this a bad dish, but you got to remember that this is a \"Fast Casual\" version of traditional dishes. Compromise, I suppose. What I did get was some good food really fast.  Rice and all was good and had a nutty aroma with hints of saffron. While some reviews have said the rice was dry, mine came out perfectly cooked. Keep in mind that I was there right at the start of lunch service so your mileage may vary.  Definitely satisfying enough to dig deeper. Next time I want to give those enticing kabobs a try. I'd say if you're hungry for Indian classics and in the neighborhood, it's definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Tried it for dinner last night with girlfriend and kids. Decor nice. Smell of restaurant enticing. Food a little disappointing. Pick your own selection was a big dish of a sauce you choose with chuncks of chicken in it. Some chose chicken bowl and that was some dried rice with small bits of chicken. My daughter had a wrap. All the chicken was similar. Very dry and grilled. Garlic nan bread was ok. I was hoping for more from this new place. I may try once more after they're open for awhile.  The fried okra fries were really good. Sliced very thin and seasoned good."}
{"text":"I had the chicken tikka masala and the chicken samosas. Some of the best Indian food around Charlotte. Awesome concept of the quick order (fast food style) but being able to sit down with service provided to you. Everyone was super nice and very professional. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Fast casual Indian Food--I had Chicken Korma with brown rice and garlic Naan. Very tasty and the pickled red onions added a nice flavor (would have enjoyed more of those).  Parked in the nearby Earth Fare garage with no trouble. The staff were warm and invited me to taste the sauce of my choice (I tried the Coconut curry which was very good too).   I will definitely come back and I see some takeout dinners in my future. The wraps look interesting too."}
{"text":"The food is decent here. It's is definitely fast casual. Don't order appetizers and expect them to be actual appetizers, they will likely come out right alongside (or maybe even after) your entrees. I have eaten here twice now and find the portions to be quite small. There was only three pieces of chicken in my entree and the rice portion is puny. I am not a very large person or a large eater, either. At most places, I generally have some leftovers. Not here though!  I am really hoping this place can get the kinks out and increase portion sizes. I actually saw one person order two entrees to make up for the small size!"}
{"text":"Great concept and definitely a new take on Indian cuisine. Food is good and flavors are very authentic, considering this is a fast casual place. Vegetarian options are rally good and won't disappoint. Only complaint is that portions seem a little bit small when compared to, the delicious, Yafo across the street."}
{"text":"Good food and great service! You get an authentic tandur BBQ flavor that you can only get from a clay oven! Portions are perfect and we'll def be back to try out other items."}
{"text":"Fast-food like Indian, so expect fast-food like quality and taste. Their Chicken Tikka Masala -their best seller- is OK. Small portions for the price. Nice atmosphere and very friendly staff. All in all, OK not great"}
{"text":"The service was quick and methodical and a limited menu when compared with the more traditional Indian restaurant. Is it the best Indian food I've had? No but Having eaten at Indian weddings where the food was spectacular my opinion is very subjective. but this by far it is quite good for what I would consider a Showmars-ish type service. Often I find Indian cusine a little heavy handed on the ghee or whatever fat is used, but not here. The okra fries were as everyone says, tasty- not oily but the lime was desert dry. The wife had Saag with Chicken. We thought saag was quite nice, just enough spice while the chicken was tender and not dry.  I had the lamb kabob and thought it nicely spiced though a bit over cooked and the accompanying sauce a bit too mild for my taste, basmati rice was different  than what I have experienced before but overall pretty good, mild taste with a slight hint of cardamom and caraway.   Question is, would I eat here again? Yep, if I am in Southpark area and wanting a quick Indian experience."}
{"text":"I was recommend this place by a friend so I decided to check it out. The food was pretty good and the drinks were tasty but i found not 1 not 2 BUT THREE HAIRS IN MY DISH. One star removed for every hair. The food (without the hair) would be a 4 star."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this place to open. I love Indian food and Charlotte needs more fast casual Indian food choices.   The food was MEH. The tikki masala literally tasted like tomato soup. The saag paneer was loose and watery. Overall was highly underwhelming and very disappointing. If you are a Indian food lover I do not recommend going here. You will be disappointed and it will just make you want to go out and get REAL Indian food to satisfy your cravings."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch. The order taking process was painful, and not being able to customize the level of spicy ness of your food in the kitchen is definitely a huge negative. Our order was veggie samosas to start, and chicken korma and saag paneer as entrees. The samosas were cold as though not sufficiently thawed. The entrees came out before I even took my first bite of a samosa. Both entrees were extremely liquid, and not warmed throughout. This was perhaps indicative of not microwaving long enough??? This place could work for people who are not regular Indian cuisine eaters. But it not worth your hard-earned dollars nor your time. Such a shame the location and appearance are perfect."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Southpark!  Indian food that will even be enjoyed by people who normally don't like/can't eat Indian Food (like me). A fresh, clean, bright environment, helpful, friendly employees, awesome selection on the menu, and the food is absolutely delicious!!  It really is addictive.  Large dining area, and a great patio area too!"}
{"text":"I had relatively low expectations going into lunch here today, and I have to say they should have been higher.   For a quasi-fast-food chain, they did a really good job with A) the mango lassi, B) the veggie samosas (which came out hot, crisp and delicious), and 3) the chicken korma over saffron biryani with garlic naan.  The primary colors decor and driving dance club music notwithstanding,  a most excellent first impression!"}
{"text":"Crazy good! Came here for the first time with my girlfriend after stalking this place on Charlotte Agenda for some time. Everything. Was. Amazing!  We asked about the sauces and they were more than happy to let us try any and all. We decided to go with the chicken Korma, okra, and a madras shrimp wrap. I was ready to bathe in the korma sauce, but that's not socially acceptable. The okra was crispy and delicious and my girlfriend ate her wrap more quickly than I've seen anyone consume food.   We also tried two of the Indian beers while we dined in. They were the perfect addition to our really yummy meal.   Five stars for sure! Absolutely going to make it here again.   Yum yum in my tum tum"}
{"text":"We arrived to a completely packed restaurant - which was not surprising given all the hype and anticipation. Waited in like for about 5 minutes which gave us the time to look over the menu they have many traditional dishes that you can order with a choice of saffron basmati, white or brown rice. You also get a choice of garlic or regular naan. I asked for a water cup and was handed a respectable sized cup. I was pleasantly surprised when I went to get my water there they supplied tips specifically for the water cups.   We had trouble finding seats at first, but eventually found a table and sat. The food took a solid 15 - 20 minutes to arrive. I'm going to chalk that up to new restaurant kinks that will be worked out over the time. The girl who delivered our meal wasn't entirely clear about what she was putting on the table and so I accidentally ended up trying my friends paneer. The manager (I think) was quick to see an issue had occurred and even offered to get us new food.   The tikka masala had great flavor - it has a little spiciness to it, but I liked it. The rice was cooked well and the chicken pieces were cooked perfectly. The naan was pretty good, not the best I've ever had though. I tend to like it softer, this was more crispy.   The meals were portioned properly (in my opinion) however if my husband was with me he would claim it was way too small of a portion.   The restaurant was decorated with bold colors and colored lights. You can see through to the kitchen there are two beautiful ovens. And when you are filling your drinks you can see their spice closet! Pretty cool.   We tried finding trash cans when we were there... couldn't find them so we gave up and threw our trash out in an outside garbage can. This was kinda bizarre.   Look forward to returning, hopefully wait times decrease!"}
{"text":"Wow. I was a little skeptical of a counter service style Indian restaurant. Was I completely wrong. This is probably the best Indian food we've had in Charlotte. Everything is so fresh. We had the nannchos which had a combination of queso, jalapeÃ±o raita, and smokey tamarind sauce that is binge worthy. We added the chicken, which gives it an oven cooked flavor. You have to try it.  We also got the veggie samosas. So fresh, no onions (which places will use as filler instead of the good stuff), and worth every bite. The mint chutney is spicy and the tamarind sauce is sweet. Mix them together on the samosa. Trust me.Their house favorite is the chicken tikka w/ saffron rice and garlic naan. That's on our next visit list.   Final pluses: they have club soda in their drink fountain. That's a win. They also brew their own tea because fountain tea is shameful in the south. Full of shame. Silverware and napkins are readily available and they have \"spice\" shakers. I have no idea what spices are in the mix, but it's good. If you like Indian cuisine, pass up the the full service joints one night and try this spot."}
{"text":"I have never had Indian food before and I gotta say, this place is AMAZING. The food is so flavorful and the atmosphere is really inviting. I love the fast paced club music they play too. I'm really excited Southpark got some spice to it finally, it needed a place like Tandur.   I'm excited to be coming back here very soon!"}
{"text":"For those of you who have been to YAFO, right across the parking lot from here, this reminded me of the Indian version of that.  It had a trendy vibe, had the pulsating music that was just a tad too loud to support a lot of conversation, and had the counter from which you order.  Same concept.  Unfortunately, the food here is not nearly as good as that over at YAFO. I expected so much better. I had the chicken kebab and the chicken was very dry.  My friend, Kathleen, had the lamb kebab and she made the same exact comment:  too dry.   The rice was very tasty as was the tiny container of green sauce that came on the plate.  I LOVE Indian food and maybe this was just an off day, after all they have very recently opened.  For me, this restaurant is a good concept, but just fell short on overall quality.   And, it would have been nice to have had someone checking on us to make sure we were okay during our dining experience. I may or may not give this one another try.   The jury is totally out."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Indian food, I love it, I cook it, I read about it. This new restaurant has some great dishes, and fantastic Tandoor Ovens. You walk in and order your food at the front, you can walk by where they are cooking the food. The menu is up on the wall  and has some different things that I have never had in a Indian restaurant, such as a Indian wrap.  We started out with a wonderful item I have never had before, Okra Fries. Thinly sliced okra, deep fried and crispy, so light and delicious I will be craving this dish for the next few weeks! We also had the Chicken Samosas and the Veggie Samosas, they were full of chicken and potato and wonderful.  We also had the Kale Pakoras, it was shredded kale and veggies in a patty form and fried. They were very good.  I had the Kadai  Saucy EntrÃ©e: Red onions, bell peppers, chili tomato oil, and added Steak to it for the protein. It was dark and rich and so flavorful. It came with some Naan and a little side of rice.   My husband had the Punjab Chicken Wrap. His came with a chick pea salad and potato chips.  They had not gotten their liquor license yet but they have a wonderful Pomegranate tea and a Mint  Lemonade. Its strange to eat this spice filled food in a light bright modern setting but it really has some great  food!"}
{"text":"Nice place, it's like Indian fast food. Expect it caters to wider audience. you have wraps and platters as well. Service was amazing, fast and efficient. Place was clean and food came in record time. I was very happy with this. Food wise it was good. i am compare to sit down Indian restaurant, you might disagree. But as causal dinning, it was pretty good. Would recommend if you want to grab a quick bite Indian style."}
{"text":"As someone who is not incredibly well versed in Indian cuisine, Tandur is wonderful for a newbie. Additionally, their menu is authentic enough to also interest long-time lovers of Indian cuisine. Must try menu items include: Chicken Tikka Masala, Wings, Okra Fries and their Pomegranate Lemonade (seriously, I could live on that!)   Their space is bright and friendly, their food is delicious, their staff is knowledgable and helpful and the price point is just right."}
{"text":"Went yesterday and had a chicken wrap and my son had a wrap also. We are huge fans of  Indian food after having grown up with it in London. We sampled the vindaloo which tasted like no vindaloo I have ever eaten. The flavor was way off and not familiar. Son sampled korma and it was better but too watery and weak. The wraps were amply filled with meat but the curry flavor was like not a flavor for which I am familiar or would order again. They were O.K. but not very good in my humble but experienced opinion. I ordered the side of fried okra. It was tasteless and disappointing I don't think it will ever be ordered twice by the same person. I would prefer a small side of bhindi-bhadji or something else like that. I also suggest that the potato chips not be served. It would be more pleasing to be served a pappadom.  Remember, this opinion is based on my comparison with Indian curries I have eaten over the past many decades and people have different opinions of different flavors. I certainly think everyone should give this place a try and form your own opinion. The service was friendly and there on the spot, but it is definitely fast food and is convenient. I will eventually go back and try something else."}
{"text":"So, disclaimer, this review is by me, a person that does not always love Indian food.  I am a big fan of most of the flavors but the preparations can turn me off.  Now, I liked tandur but I can see how not everyone will.  This place is like the salsaritas of authentic Mexican.  It's doing the dishes and concepts you have heard of but making them both kid friendly and just dumbing them down.  I like salsaritas but I love authentic Mexican too.    Now to the food we had, I tried the chicken kadai, awesome flavor, sauce was a little spicy, smoky, really solid.  Wife had chicken tikka masala and it was tomato soup with coconut milk, nothing special, and supposedly their signature dish.  We also tried the nan-chos, ehh, concept is awesome, execution was 6/10.  We also tried kale pakora, deep fried kale fritters, I really liked them.  Let's be honest, deep fried kale is your best kale.    Service was great, of course a little pricey but, hello, welcome to South Park.  We will give them some time to tweak their flavors and then try them again.   Overall, I'm glad I went."}
{"text":"Really good casual Indian. Food is flavorful and staff is warm and friendly. Will definitely be back ."}
{"text":"I was in the area for a business meeting and I ordered the chicken Tikka Masala.  The spices were great and the Tikka Masala sauce is perfect to dip the garlic naan in .  I enjoyed the fast casual approach for Indian cuisine.  I would recommend Tandur and I will definitely eat here again when I am back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I decided to checkout this place after someone mentioned it was akin to Copper Indian restaurant but not as expensive.  I agree, this place is not as expensive as Copper but the food is not as good either. I sampled the Wings and the chicken biryani rice. Both were above average in taste but not mind blowing.. meaning I have no desire to immediately return. Very pleasant staff, ambience of the place is welcoming and you can watch the cooks making kabobs in plain view. Parking may be an issue during peak hours but the location is great (near Yafo's Mediterranean restaurant). Perhaps a different selection from the menu (salmon kabobs?) would be worth trying and warrant a higher score than 3 out of 5."}
{"text":"Indian Food for Dummies. I love Indian food. I love the rich layers of flavors in Indian food. I love the spice forward dishes like Tikka Masala, Korma and Vindaloo. I found Tandur lacking all that. They're serving up a watered down, Americanized version of Indian food. AKA, Indian food for dummies. (My husband loved it. No one tell him I essentially just called him a dummy, kay? Thanks, byeeee!)   We started with the naanchos and kale pakora. Both were fun concepts, riffs on traditional Indian food and both edible. But, as you'll notice is the common thread in all the dishes we tried, they lacked that explosion of flavor I've come to expect in Indian food. I also had the mint ginger lemonade, which I think may have actually gone bad. It tasted more like basil than mint or ginger and had a really funky savory taste. The cashier described it as light and refreshing. I'd disagree.   For my entree, I went with my old standby, Chicken Tikka Masala. While the chicken itself was good, the sauce was totally underwhelming. It tasted like creamy tomato soup. The garlic naan tasted like pita bread. I didn't get any real garlic flavor at all. My husband got the Kadai sauce. It was better than mine -- you could at least taste the chili oil and I found myself abandoning my bowl of masala to drag my naan through his sauce. If we go back, that will probably be what I get. But, I have to admit, it's going to be hard to go back knowing there are so many other, more authentic and flavorful Indian restaurants all over town."}
{"text":"I was very excited about Tandur so maybe I had high expectations but I left disappointed. All of the employees were very friendly offering samples of the sauces and giving recommendations. The food came out very fast. What brings the rating down is the food. My food came out and it looked like a small appetizer. All of us had ordered our own entrees and each of us were still hungry. I'm used to having leftovers when I get Indian food. Not here. We ended up getting food at EarthFare after we ate.  Also the food was very Americanized. Not authentic at all which I can understand since fast casual restaurants generally want to appeal to many different taste palettes. The food was definitely toned down a lot. I think it might be worth trying again in hopes that we all just ordered the wrong meals."}
{"text":"I don't normally go in on a new business but I am so disappointed with my order at Tandur....the lamb kebob looks kinda like a dried up hot dog, the rice is just not palatable...the curry is oily and waaay too spicy.  And the side of naan...I'm pretty sure came off someone else's plate of leftovers. I'm embarrassed to serve this to my family tonight. For your hard earned money, skip this place and head across the street to YAFO instead. Seriously."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch with a girlfriend. I was having trouble finding it so I had to call. Once I was in the correct area, it was a breeze. I had to parallel park so it was a bit of a struggle for me since I don't do that often. They weren't busy at all and offered to give us samples of the sauces. I tried the vindaloo sauce because I love spicy. I decided to go for that with chicken. It was fantastic!! It came with rice and naan and some pickled onions. I ate my WHOLE meal. Next time I want to try the naanchos!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious im amazed by the interior and the big vent outside the restaurant which blows all the aroma of those deliciousness outside and let me tell you thats a good business idea to let the customers know that you've got awesome food. I wouldn't say that its indian because they are missing that kick in the food but the food is really delicious and worth the price. The only thing that i would say is to increase the quantity of the plate a little bit more because the other restaurants out there have better portions compared to this one. But this place is a must visit if you're looking for something nice and doesn't hurt your stomach with all the spice yet has the indian taste. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"This place does not taste like authentic Indian food. The 'masala' tasted like tomato soup!! The garlic naan was burnt on the bottom and not fluffy. Also, a large 'ginger lemonade' was $5 and tasted sooo bad. I love juices, but this drink tasted like straight basil or some type of fungi. I highly doubt we would return unless we were in the shopping area and needed a quick bite to eat. Even then, skipping on the 'masala' & juices."}
{"text":"Oh man. So many great combos and dishes that I need to go back soon. Of course, what I ordered was really good. I had the Kadai Sauce with Chicken and Jasmine Rice. If you go with a saucey entrees then you pick the sauce with varying spice and flavor profiles, then the protein, and sides. I loved the heat in the Kadai sauce because it didn't overpower the tomato and onion flavors.   Toughest decision is whether to add the rice to the sauce bowl or pull the chicken out onto the rice to combine. Either way works! I had the garlic naan which wasn't a good batch compared to others experiences so I'm sure I just got a bad bunch and won't hurt the review here because I used all of it to deliver every bit of sauce into my belly. It worked well for that purpose.   3 of us did split the Okra Fries and Kale Pakora. LOVED both of them and it doesn't matter I don't like Kale or Okra because the fried crispiness wins. Want to go back to try the wings, the biryani bowls, and the other sauces too."}
{"text":"Naanchos, naanchos, naanchos and more naanchos!!! Well that would be my ideal world maybe my new favorite food!   Tandur Indian Kitchen is a new fast casual restaurant next to Earthfare in the South Park area. I've been there 3 times already and twice back to back!!! Let's say they're doing something right.   My first visit was to grab a menu and to check out the atmosphere. Everyone was super nice and they let me sample some of the sauces for the entrees.   The second visit I had the ever so delicious NAANCHOS add chicken and a kids order of the Chicken Tikka Masala. Well we know what my favorite thing was and I will be back for more!!! The sauces and the crispy naan bread chips topped with the pieces of chicken are amazing!!! It's also a very filling dish and a good price. Let's just say they may be my meal choice from now on. The kids portion of Tikka  Masala was a good amount of food and also very tasty.   The third visit I had the Spiced Okra Fries and the 6 Tandoori Chicken wings. The okra fries were ok nothing to write home about and the wings were tasty once I got some of the ranch to dip them in. I believe the sauce it came out with was a mint chutney which wasn't bad but the ranch was better with the wings.   The inside of the restaurant is very chill and cozy. The staff is very young (seems like it may be many of their first jobs) but attentive. The menu isn't very extensive but has a lot of options.   I'm soo happy they so close to work. It's a perfect new lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Watered down chicken Tikka masala but samosas (veggie and chicken) were great.  The best dish was chicken nachos...worth trying at least once"}
{"text":"Loving the fast-casual Indian food concept!  They offer a variety of dishes - from currys to kebabs and salads!  I got one of the curry/saucy dishes, which comes with naan (regular or garlic) and rice.  Plenty of naan and rice to go with the amount of curry provided in the bowl.  They provide the levels of spice on the menu next to the item and also have 'spice shakers' available next to the drink fountain for an added kick.   The staff were also very friendly and attentive.  Will definitely be back!  Oh, and most definitely order the okra fries - those things are addictingly good!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for Tandur to open for months! So glad I was able to try it. The customer service was spot on, they allowed us to try the different sauces upon request and were very helpful on how the menu worked. I was able to try the fried okra fries, they were amazing as well as the kale pakora. For food I had the coconut curry and my friend had the tikki Marsala, we both had chicken. The saffron basmati rice with the garlic naan bread was delicious.  Was it the best Indian food I've had no but I'd come back because its a good different place to come for lunch that's good and fast."}
{"text":"Was excited to hear about this fast - casual  Indian restaurant to open.   Unfortunately the food doesn't live up-to the  expectations and menu description. The concept is #Chipotle but for Indian Food.  The presentation was great. Some naan, some rice and curry in the bowl.  You order at the counter and take a number.  The chicken Tikka Masala lacked the taste you will get at great restaurant like #Chaupaati.  If you have ever eaten Indian Food don't go here. It is like the #WaffleHouse of Indian food."}
{"text":"We stopped in for takeout tonight and loved it! We had the Kadai with Chicken (5 STAR!) and the Vindaloo with Lamb Meatballs (5 STAR for vindaloo, 4 STAR for the lamb...only because portion was somewhat small). Staff was super friendly, helpful, and fast...we were here on opening day, which can be really chaotic, so we were impressed by that. The space looks great, with an open kitchen to see them cooking up all the delicious food, and plenty of seating to support the inevitable lunch/dinner rush. We've been really excited for this opening and it didn't disappoint - we will be back and can't wait to try other things!"}
{"text":"Very excited to try this place after all the hype, but came away disappointed from my first visit. The Chicken Tikka Masala sauce tasted like tomato bisque soup, I wouldn't order it again. The okra fries were different and very good! I think this is an ok spot for people to dabble in Indian-esque food for the first time, and I will try Tandur again but will order unique items off their menu not found at traditional Indian restaurants."}
{"text":"I have been eagerly awaiting the opening of Tandur! We made it in on a Thursday night, and there was a line to nearly the door (about 15 people deep).   We ordered the Naantachos (nachos on naan) as an app, and then the Tikka Masala with Chicken and the Tikka Massala with Paneer as our entrees. After we ordered at the counter, we looked for a table but  there were none available indoors. After waiting a bit we found a table; we then waited about 15 minutes for our food.   The app and entrees came out together. The app was fine and the entrees were as well. The most notable thing about the entrees was that there was so little rice. There were 3 pieces of naan, a bowl of the tikka massala, and a small mound of rice. There was not nearly enough rice for the amount of sauce provided.   My friend quickly identified that the best way to eat the entrees was to dip the naan in the sauce bowl and then later add the rice to the bowl.   The portions are small - medium size. My boyfriend said he left hungry, even though he had an app and an entree (and even some of my entree).  The food was adequate for fast casual dining, but was not nearly as good as Copper or Blue Taj (other Charlotte Indian Restaurants). Also, the Tikka masala sauce was spicy despite being labeled as having no spice. It was ok for me, but someone who is spicy averse would not enjoy the Tikka masala sauce.   They had a lot of people working, and the employees were friendly and attentive. I was so excited for this place to open, but it just didn't meet my expectations."}
{"text":"Think of this as \"Indian Fast Food\". And they'll let you sample pretty much anything before you order, which is helpful! The portions were reasonable, though charging $2 for extra rice when they only give you a 1-cup portion with your sauce dish seems a bit steep - it's rice. I do appreciate that they give you the option of white or brown rice though! We tried the fried okra but weren't really a fan - they were like shredded okra that had been flash fried rather than rounds/discs of okra. The veggie samosas were quite good. We both got the korma sauce dish (one with chicken and one with paneer), which was good but it had a slightly bitter aftertaste which was odd. We also got a Mango Lassi which was yummy. There were a lot of other things we saw them cooking through the glass that looked good too - especially the kebabs and grilled meats. I'm not sure we'd necessarily go out of our way to return here since it's a bit of a hike for us and we have closer options for Indian restaurants, but if we were already nearby or if we were with friends and they wanted to go here, I wouldn't mind joining them and trying something new."}
{"text":"Like others, I've been waiting a long time for this place to open. So I was bummed that the food was so forgettable. We placed a takeout order of the lamb meatball vindaloo, a salad, and naanchos. The meatball was fine, the texture of the vindaloo was off, lacked flavor, and had no element of any heat. We also ordered a salad with shrimp; what we got was salad with the tandur chicken. That chicken was bland, tough in texture, and completely uninspired. The \"naanchos\" were probably the best part of the meal, aside from the lassi. The ambiance was great, but they have a long way to go to catch up with YaFo. And it wasn't cheap. Which would have been fine if the food was good, but for the same price we probably could have had a great lunch at Copper  or Blue Taj. I'd rather see Tandur focus on serving authentic Indian food rather than a cute play on Indian food for the South Park crowd. We'll definitely come back because we're hoping our experience was an outlier, but so far we're not impressed."}
{"text":"Tandur definitely helps close a gap in the restaurant scene in this part of town! For our first visit we decided to get take out. It's a cute spot, and for a Wednesday evening they were pretty busy. It looks child friendly, and the staff is helpful and courteous. Also, our food was ready in under 10 minutes. We tried the Goa Wrap (lamb), the chicken kebabs with rice (tandoori), and for the kid we got the paneer quesadilla. The overall verdict was two thumbs up. The lamb wrap was tasty, the chicken well cooked and flavorful, and the quesadilla was a hit with the kid. I would have preferred if it was paneer with some flavoring & veggies, rather than just plain paneer and cheese - not particularly nutritious, but a good treat. The portions, I thought, were perfect - not too big, not too small.. just the right amount of food, with no leftovers. The sparkling ginger mint beverage was a little too sweet for my liking, but for anyone who finds Indian food spicy, that would be the right drink choice :) I'm definitely a fan, and will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Came into Tandur for a quick lunch and have mixed feelings about it.   The positives are the friendly faces, nice decor and design, and a plentiful menu. If you need to learn information about the ingredients or the dishes, there is a large virtual screen as soon as you walk in the door that can help you with your questions. Clever for many reasons: 1) Limit the questions at the register and therefore reduces wait time, 2) Allows people to know what it is they are about to eat, even in fast paced dining.    However--beginning with some of the cons--as a vegan the options are quite limited. But I did settle for the tofu kebobs with rice. The portions are small, but the flavor was nicely done on the kabobs. It is nice when tofu has a wonderful flavor and they did accomplish this. The rice was dry unfortunately. The mango slaw the was a side for this dish was very delicious, nice light flavors.   The friend I was with has had two dishes here so far, a wrap and a bowl. He recommends getting a bowl if you want larger portions of food and also said the flavor was better than the wrap.   Another negative was the fact that a lot of the tables were dirty and the restroom needed some serious cleaning as well.   I may try again after the initial beginning stages of working out kinks has subsided, but for now I was not blown away."}
{"text":"The food was disappointing and over-priced. If you've ever eaten Indian food, don't go here - it is like the McDonald's of Indian food, but priced like a normal quality Indian meal. The sauces are watered down (the tikka Marsala tasted like marinera) the lamb was an unknown substance, the naan was like eating a flavorless cracker and the wings were ok (but not worth $7 for 6 small wings). I wondered why the place was empty at dinner time and now I know why. Take a pass and save your money. Go get yafo instead"}
{"text":"I rarely give 2 star reviews.  Very bland Indian food. There was no spice, no heat, and no flavor. Servers were nice. Restaurant was clean. Really wanted to like this place but was quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Worth trying for the concept. However the food did not meet the expectation. We came for quick dinner on first weekend but take out might have been better. Took awful lot of time to get food at table given its casual fast place.    However three stars are due to food taste.  We tried vindaloo, tikka and Kadai sauce. Only Kadai was something palatable. Vindaloo was too sour and watery.  Tikka was bland more like tomato bisque flavor.  Kale pakora and okra fries were good to try. Samosa were good but can be little less salty     Overall , you can try as lunch take out as once. I would not come back for dine in.  I think  Choolah in Cleveland & DC area has executed this concept so well , making Tandur sound like pale me-too effort."}
{"text":"Finally, an approachable fast-casual option for Indian cuisine. Anyone that spends five minutes in the new location can appreciate the decor, the educational pieces (the touch screen, the greeters who walk you through the menu, the sauces, etc.) and the drool-inducing smells. Take a little more time for your order to come out (super fast, I might add) and you'll get what the hype is about. The naanchos (make sure you add meat) are amazing, the chicken tikka masala (pick basmati rice to go with it) is incredible, and the wings are killer - in the best way. I crave the sparkling pomegranate lemonade on the regular and have been known to leave my place of work (Uptown) to drive over on my lunch break just for an order of naan and lemonade to go. Overall, I'm in love with the flavors, the value, and the look of it all. Job well done!"}
{"text":"After months of watching Tandur get ready to open I visited the first week to a line out the door, good sign or just excitement for a new restaurant opening? Well since visiting open week I have returned for a second visit and still think everything is okay. Tandur offers a variety of starters and Entrees, even  a kids menu. I have enjoyed the Chicken Samosas, Fried Okra, Naanchos (all starters) and the Chicken Tikka Masala with Safron Rice and Naan. The Chicken Samosas are the standout starter for me. Fried just right with a heavy amount of filling. The Tikka Masala is good, but somewhat bland in my mind. Unlike traditional Indian restaurants you cannot indicate a spice level so I feel like it is missing a little more flavor. In addition I do wish the Garlic Naan has a little more garlic flavor.  The decor is inviting and staff is great. All tables are monitored by several staff members and once done they clear the tables. Overall, Tandur is a great addition to Southpark, but remember it is a fast casual Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Friendly staff & fast service.  Not the place for vegetarians (unlike most Indian restaurants). The vegetable medley consists of mostly chickpeas, some corn  & a few peppers (where are the eggplant dishes?) The saag paneer was mediocre. SouthPark needs a real Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow!! I've been watching and waiting for Tandur to open for months and the wait paid off. First off the staff is super friendly and all very knowledgeable about the menu. The decor is gorgeous and the patio on this sunny day is the spot to be! I ordered the Punjab Chicken Wrap. It came with chickpeas and potato crisps on the side. The bread for the wrap was super tasty, and the spices on everything are super well balanced and complex. So tasty, so fresh, and what a healthy menu! I wish it was more spicy, but I also put sriracha on my cereal... I would definitely try this place!!! I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I have always loved Indian cuisine, but craved a spot where I could get in and out quickly, and without the pressure of \"making reservations\".  Tandur has answered and elevated the call to great cuisine, spice-filled and delicious dishes, ideal pricing, polished ambience, and the most professional of staff!   I have enjoyed this casual dining 3 nights in a row!! It's like the \"Panera\" of Indian Cuisine and I am grateful to its arrival in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good place to start if you've never had Indian food or just want some Indian food on lunch. Clean, tasty, great service.  Not the best I've had but you get a good variety and some fun twists with a few items on the menu.  Giving it 4 stars just because it was super clean in there, service was excellent, food was good and they are quick and convenient.  You can't always be in and out in 30 mins at a traditional Indian restaurant."}
