{"text":"Good food...bad service and quite pricey for what you get. I had the Montreal smoked meat sandwich which was amazing.  The service was not great.  I had to keep asking for my water to be refilled-hate that!  The positives are the funnel cake was to die for and the washroom are spotless with nice soap and cream."}
{"text":"Absolutely beautiful restaurant with a nice view! The food is great and I would definitely recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Went here with the family for my mom's Birthday celebrations. We enjoyed the Corned Beef Sandwich with Tomato Basil Soup, Mediterranean Penne Pasta and I had the Seafood Linguini. We finished the meal off with Nine18's rich and delicious cheesecake.   I can speak for the Seafood Linguini and say that it came with plenty of calamari, shrimp and muscles which were all delicious in a light tomato sauce. Nothing unexpected but pleasantly delicious.    The atmosphere was relaxing and there was a nice view from the patio out on to the golf course. The service was standard and the overall restaurant wasn't too full which made for a good place for conversation. I would visit here again with friends but not if I was in the mood to be adventurous as there is good selection but quite conservative."}
{"text":"View was absolutely stunning! Food was average, kind of bland. This place is like a hidden gem though!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice to take advantage of the good weather so both times I've sat outside. I love the atmosphere and it's not too well known so it's never crowded. The peach belly is are delicious and the food is great. On my first visit I had the volcano burger and underestimated how hot it would be. My nose was running like a faucet! For dessert we had an amazing cheesecake. On my second visit I had the rigatoni bolognese which was okay, nothing magnificent. Although I loved the food the service needs major work. On both visits it took far too long for us to be greeted or offered so much as water. Our food came out in good time but then no one checked on us to ask how it was. Then it took forever to get the bill. I enjoyed the alone time catching up with my girlfriend but it was unacceptable. The atmosphere and food may land me there again but I hope the servers will be more attentive !!!"}
{"text":"Went to Nine18 today for Mother's Day brunch and was pretty disappointed. Please note this review is solely based on the food, as the restaurant setting is beautifully overlooking the golf course.  The Mother's Day brunch consisted of a lot of cold salads i.e., pasta, tomato and Boccaccio, smoked salmon, some hot plate items such as pasta, potato, and beef. There was an omelet station and dessert table. The omelet was decent but comparable to when you eat at Marche. At first glance the dessert table looked good, but unfortunately they were very dry and not flavorful(at the end of our seating the dessert table looked untouched).  I would not recommend this restaurant. For 4 guests, including 1 mimosa and 1 Caesar, our bill was $198.  To the point, this place is overpriced mediocre food."}
{"text":"Had a late lunch with my girls today out on the patio!  Beautiful scenery and good food.  The food was good but nothing really outstanding and you get what you pay for.  The view of the golf course was nice and just a calm atmosphere to be in for some drinks and chit chat.  Service was good as well as our server made sure we had everything we needed."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour with my sister. Portions are small but food was good. We had tacos. We really went for the view. Loved it."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great atmosphere. Sitting on the patio was gorgeous as the sun sets. Very reasonable priced apps and portions are good. Probably one of the best meals I've had in awhile even though my friend and I shared 4 apps !"}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable! I have now been there in the summer and winter and it was awesome both times. In the summer, the patio balcony was beautiful, the food is always amazing and the service is great, but the real story happened last night. We are currently having a huge ice storm in Brampton. My best friend and I went to Nine 18 for dinner last night and the power went out multiple times in the restaurant. The staff was extremely accommodating and relaxed. We got free shots and desserts without even asking for them. This was probably the first time ever this friend and I have gone out without one of us driving. We absolutely could not find a cab anywhere even after an hour of trying. The staff tried as well and actually waited with us until we could find a way home at the end of the evening. Whoever the manager was on the evening of December 21st, 2013 and our server, Shawn were amazing! Even with the power out and our transportation issues, it was still a wonderful experience and I would 100% go back again! This time I'll drive though, haha."}
{"text":"I have heard wildly mixed reviews about this place. However, I've been multiple times and love it. The patio is one of the most beautiful views for a patio in Brampton (that being said, there's not too much competition in that department...) and the entire building is gorgeous inside. However, it's not overly formal or intimidating in any way.  The food is reasonably priced and always good and my servers have always been kind and attentive.   My one criticism is that the menu has been the same for as long as I've gone there and so could definitely use a revamping."}
{"text":"The food here is really overpriced.  For Brampton, the menu is expensive but below par (no pun intended) for quality which equals overpriced.  Its 30-40% more expensive than the local chain restaurants yet not as good which is sad because the big chains aren't even that good.  The service is above bad but below good which is another negative for them.  The only positive this place has going for it is that it has an overpriced par 3 golf course attached to it (actually, thats a negative followed by a positive so I suppose its a neutral).  Wait!  Its nice inside!  Thats a positive!"}
{"text":"It is a clubhouse restaurant locating inside the Turnberry Golf Club.  The restaurant is very spacious.  It has a very nice view overlooking the golf course on one side of the windows.  The fireplace makes this place feeling cozy and it is also practical for the colder weather.  I was all warmed up by sitting near the fireplace after golfing at a temperature of only 12c.  There is a smaller open-air/covered patio area facing another side of the golf course and the landscaped garden terrace and tent.  The washroom is clean and spacious and best of all, it provides hand lotion:)  This restaurant opens from Mondays to Sundays from 11am to 11pm.  There are good selection beers on tap; good deal on daily specials; as well as good and friendly service.  The $3 each fish taco on Friday is an awesome deal and it is yummmmmy!  Although this place is a bit far from my area, I don't mind come back again at all!"}
{"text":"The Hungry Gills hit this place up for my brother's birthday, and it was a hit.   Here is what we ordered  Karn (me): 1) Erdinger Weissbr√§u (Beer)  2) Seafood Linguine  Neetu: 1) Mushroom Ravioli  Dessert: 1) Chocolate Overload  The beer selection was good, and Karn was actually quite surprised they even had an Erdinger brand beer. They also have beers specially available during different periods of the year (fall/winter beers). Thumbs up to that!  Seafood Linguine This dish contains: cherry tomatoes, shrimp & mussels in a tomato lobster broth.  The dish itself contained about 4 shrimps and 5 mussels. The shrimp was a good size and had some flavour to it. The mussels, had like almost ZERO meat in it. Karn actually started laughing when he opened one up, shocked to see the little pebble of meat. The linguine was cooked just right, and the tomato lobster broth was a delicious sauce to have with it. Loved the cherry tomatoes! But when isn't cherry tomatoes great?   Mushroom Ravioli  This dish contains: Ravioli pasta stuffed with portobello and cremini mushrooms, all in a pesto cream sauce, with some parmesan and basil.  This was really tasty! The only complaints we can think of is the amount of oil in the sauce and the portion was a bit smaller than we would've liked it. Other than that, this dish is a hit.  Chocolate Overload This dish contains: Pecan brownie with chocolate ganache wrapped & baked in filo pastry served with chocolate ice cream on top.  Delicious! Delicious! Delicious!!!!  Did we say delicious? This is a must get if you come to Nine18. Our top 5 desserts of all time. If you love chocolate, you will die for this dessert, you will wake up in the middle of the night thinking if it was true, did the dessert really exist? or was it all a dream? GET IT!

{"text":"Nice patio looking at the gold course view. The server was really nice and so was the girl standing at the front door. I had asked the server to bring a piece of cake after we ate for my bfs dinner and they did (it was on the house!). The food was decent. I highly recommend the nachos with guac!"}
