{"text":"Had to try this place after seeing all the Instagram posts.  Happy to say that the food and experience definitely did not disappoint.  The outdoor patio atmosphere was great and the dishes were interesting in the fact that they incorporated different cuisines.  Definitely have to recommend the bone marrow and the octopus!"}
{"text":"Weird experience. Don't know how to say this - but the whole restaurant gives me weird vibe. The interior is very imbalanced and being someone who appreciates nice and coordinated interior design, I felt very uncomfortable sitting there. You'll see what I mean if you go there and have a look yourself. There're some big tables in the middle of the dinning area - potentially good for big groups if you want to celebrate there.  The staff were friendly and nice, however it was very noticeable that most of them are very young and inexperienced.   Food was just ok - below my expectations. I feel like they're trying too hard to be fusion and they haven't really mastered the menu yet. The pancake with pork was very weird. They had that green onion oil dip that you get when you eat chicken from a Chinese siu mei place. It was honestly too salty and it didn't go with the pork or the pancake. Pancake was a too dense and not fluffy enough. The bone marrow was quite nice though. Really like they added some chilli peppers and limes to balance out the greasiness of the bone marrow. But the portion was too small. Actually, most of the dishes on the menu come in very small portions - so be aware of that.  Overall didn't really enjoy my time there. But I didn't really like their sister restaurant Smash neither. Guess their style is just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"This place is new and the staff definitely reflect that. The server got our order wrong by entering 2x of one order and not inputting the appetizer initially. He blamed it on the UI of the ordering system. They did not charge us for the extra order and comped the appetizer. Customer service well done!   We ordered the ox tongue to start - not a fan of ox tongue to begin with but wow I may have to reconsider now.   Our mains were the spaghetti squash and the pork + pancakes. Both dishes were very flavourful and the char siu on the pork dish gave congee queen a run for its money :p the pancakes were also moist and tender. I just wish they had the maple syurp on the side instead of drizzling it on the top of the three pancakes.   Overall very satisfied with my dinner. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Saw all the good reviews and thought I'd give it a shot. Came here for dinner with a group of friends and this was our experience...   Food:  Fried chicken - overcooked, dry(even for dark meat) and lacked flavour  Cured meat platter w/ sourdough bread - have had better cured meat. Bread was over toasted   Beet spaghetti - the flavour was good. Overcooked mushy pasta (it is spaghetti made of beet so I'm not sure if it cooks the same as regular pasta)  Flat iron steak - friends that ate it all had diarrhoea. Could have been something else they ate but they shared  the steak between them  Pancake and pork - regular tasting pancake(no fluff) with a regular tasting piece of pork(dry). The sauce did not provide any added moisture to the dry meat nor did it tie the contrasting flavours together like the ever popluar chicken and waffle, if that's what they're going far. I'm not sure what the vision was for this dish haha  Torched salmon - Flavour was nothing special. The salmon was a bit greasy even after i requested less or zero oil for my dish(the oil may have been from the fish); puffy rice was nothing special. I don't get how this combination works together  Service: the servers were friendly and helpful. It was my fiancé's bday and as the server was bringing the cake out, she commented on how she was a terrible singer and made it clear she wasn't going to sing. I get that not everyone is comfortable with singing but the table beside us was also having a bday and they had servers that sang. We're fine with that but it's inconsistent service imo  The two stars are for the atmosphere and convenience of location. I'm not a food critic nor do i aspire to be one but this was just a big disappointment on all levels. I'm not sure how they got all the good reviews but when you go 0/6 on simple culinary dishes, I can't help but to be skeptical of your high rating. Not worth the price and will not be returning"}
{"text":"I went to NextDoor twice within the past week. The 1st time - we made a reservation for dinner for 4 people right on Canada Day on Saturday July 1. We had ordered the duck wings, bone marrow and the brussel sprouts to start followed by the pork and pancakes, fried chicken, and torched salmon for mains. The food, the service - everything was great. We left feeling satisfied.  However, this bulk of this 2-star review is based on our second visit for lunch during the following Monday on July 3. Not sure what was going on that day but I saw quite a bit of chaos and confusion by the staff. Luckily we had made a reservation but we had to wait few minutes because they needed to find menus. We saw a large group wait for a good 15 minutes even though the restaurant was not quite full and also saw a smaller group leave due to the wait time.  While my girlfriend's mushroom grilled cheese was good (but the bread was burnt), my burger was a complete disappointment. It's even more disappointing when you compare my burger with a photo of the supposedly same burger posted by other Yelp members. Our dishes also did not come with kettle chips as indicated on the menu.  We had planned to come back for brunch but after the 2nd visit, we will re-consider. However I hope that this was only an \"off-day\" and not representative of the establishment as a whole.  Would have given a one-star if not for the 1st visit."}
{"text":"We ordered the torched salmon and the pork + pancakes. The dishes were both quite tasty but we found that the portions were quite small."}
{"text":"I've been to NextDoor several times and the prior experiences were nothing short of excellent. Unfortunately, my experience today was nothing but mediocre and poor.   Arranged in advance to have a cake brought in to celebrate my mother's birthday as they did not offer any cake on their desert menu. They told me that there was a $15 cake fee; but expected to get some decent service for paying such a hefty fee. Was told that there was a complimentary desert for birthdays, but we never ended up getting one. Communication from the online messenger fell short (no response) when I inquired about the desert an hour before arrival.   Waitress forgot about my cake and instead brought us the desert menu. She brought only one plate with the cake and took the cake back after the candle was blown. Cutting the cake took far too long and we waited probably around 10 minutes just for the cake to be cut and brought back. She packed the cake and left it on the bar counter before we even asked for the bill.  2 stars are for the food which was fine as usual, but service was extremely lacking and honestly quite poor. The hallway was wet throughout our dining experience as the waitress had previously split water but never bothered to clean it. One of the staff almost tripped and fell when she come to us with the bill. The washroom (in the back) was outright disgusting and worse than your average Chinese restaurants. Maybe it was their off day, but it was probably the worse dining experience I've had in the longest time."}
{"text":"First time going today and was absolutely stunned! Service was amazing, they make sure that you're taken care of! Food was delectable. We ordered oysters, ND Poke, roasted marrow and mushroom grilled cheese. Oysters were very good! Poke - my bowl was clean. For someone who doesn't like to eat rice for lunch, doesn't that say something?.. everything just tasted amazing in that bowl, I'm sure to order again when I go back! Roasted marrow - first time trying it and big mistake for not eating it right away when it was served. My girl friend and I were too busy chatting it up and gobbling the Poke down. The marrow was good with the beef tartare on top.  I'm still going to give them 5 stars because the experience, food and service was amazing. I was a little disappointed that the brunch menu wasn't there because it's only on the weekends. I guess I'll have to come back for more!!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited this new restaurant yesterday.  I have to say the food is AMAZING.  However, the reason I'm giving 4 stars is because, food portion is small for some dishes. We ordered 1 appetizer and 2 main courses and we were not full at all.   My boyfriend and I both are not big eater. We had to eat McDonald afterwards to fill up our tummy.   I will definitely come back, but hopefully they will adjust the portion a bit, especially the grilled octopus."}
{"text":"We had $15 ox tongue that ha tempura mushrooms that were overly battered, hash brown-like potatoes, lukewarm piece of tongue with uninspired flavouring. The potential for a good dish was here.  We tried the $26 braised ribs. They were overly salty and I'm not sure if the texture was supposed to be so crumbly but the mouth feel of that did not impress. It was not served hot. The potatoes and veggies were average.  The ambience here is okay. Bottom line, overpriced average tasting food which aspires for uniqueness and originality but doesn't quite get there.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Had an AMAZING dinner here! My relatives were in town and wanted to try \"Canadian\" food (in Markham!?), thankfully Yelp to the rescue showed me this gem.  The brusselsprouts were soooo good, flavoured with maple syrup and bacon, just this side of crispy, we ordered another! By consensus, the duck wings were just ok, but kale salad and torched salmon were great (you can ask for well done, it's half raw usually since it's sashimi). Lamb was nice and juicy, portions were so generous we had no room for dessert sadly!  Will be back with friends for sure! Pretty decent pricing for the quality."}
{"text":"This is the one place in markham I'd go for drinks and appys with friends. The decor and food is super hip. Especially the bartenders Sharon,  Jamie,  Amy are extremely friendly every time I come by they make me feel right at home.  Being in the suburbs it's hard to find trendy food but Next Door exceeds expectations and gives the feel of a trendy downtown restaurant. Personally I'd recommend the avocado toast or okonomiyaki for brunch and duck wings, and for dinner  bone marrow, pork and pancakes and the fried chicken are a must! Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Went to this gem twice and impressed with the food and service both times. Duck wings were delicious and crisped just right. Pork pancake and another one of our favorite. Will be back."}
{"text":"Great location and concept,  but very dissapointed at their food and service! We went there for a birthday celebration and the service was terrible! We waited for more than an hour for our food,  only with half our appetizers being served and they burnt the brussel sprouts.  Waited another 30 mins for our mains which only half the people got. The octopus was overcooked and rubbery while the seasoning was spotty on the pancake and pork was dried. Not once did the server came by for a quality check and after all the mains came out and almost finished,  we told them we're still missing two orders of bone marrow.  Needless to say,  they've dropped the order,  so they put that on the house.  Took another 30 mins for the server to figure out and print our bills,  in which couple of them were wrong,  so she went back and forth at least 5 times to re-print.  Not interested in going back at all."}
{"text":"All these reviews already rave about their stellar menu and staff. I'd like to share with you their strong commitment to ensuring that satisfaction for every guest is achieved.  What is fast food? Speed and price, maybe. But what is dining? An experience where the customer service and atmosphere is just as important as the flavour of your meal. I had a wonderful evening at Next Door, as always, but last night, a dish was forgotten - an honest mistake on the restaurant's part, and we didn't realize it ourselves either until we had left. I sent them a message after closing and, upon quick investigation with our server, received a sincere and generous apology from the owner before noon the very next day. This customer service gesture is what differentiates exceptional from good!  - Your new local fan"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! I can't believe the quality and price of this place. My favourite was definitely the Singapore Chilli Crab, the flat iron steak was also very good. I will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Was here for brunch for the first time. Nice  atmosphere. Nice staff and service. Okanomiyaki was a bit pricey and lack balance. Thick slices of pancakes topped with eggs seaweed onion skins and bacon looks cool but after eating the top part the pancake with the sauce was not that good. Sorry but not spending $20 for that. Juices are $6. $30 for breakfast with a juice and fancy mediocre tasting pancakes don't think it's my vibe. It's a nice place tho. My friend had the avocado toast. It was topped with a lot of avocado but the toast was rock hard. But I still give 3 stars for the place and service maybe the other foods are good?"}
{"text":"Had a Sunday brunch with my girlfriend and both food and service were great!  We did not make any reservation and it was packed upon arrival.  The hostess took my name and phone no saying it will take about 45 mins to 1 hour waiting. But at the end we got our table less than 20 mins. It's a very comfortable place to sit down and enjoy your meal really.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Came here for date night. The location of this place is wonderful. Right on Main Street unionville next to the pond. We came at around 9PM, so the dining area was full. We were seated at the lounge area, which is not bad.   I was a bit disappointing after closely examining the menu. It's rather small. With about 5 entres, 10 main dishes give or take. We ordered the fried oyster on mackerel as the entre, steak, and lamb steak.   The fried oyster on mackerel was delicious ! It's literally 3 fried oysters placed on top of a piece of mackerel on a bed of quinoa. The oysters give each bite a nice flavourful crunch. Then came the steak and lamb steak. The steak was served on a bed of cold slaw salad, and the lamb steak was served on a bed of arugula. I wasn't crazy about the steak, it was more like a steak salad, it's rather salty. However, the lamb steak was delicious ! It was served with cauliflower purée and arugula salad, which paired with the lamb steak beautifully.   Of course, we proceeded to dessert after mains. Again, very limited dessert selection. We ordered the banana pudding and strawberry short cake. The banana pudding was very average, feels like something you can get from Starbucks. But the strawberry short cake was light and airy.   The atmosphere of this place is good, but food is only okay for the price point."}
{"text":"The food was good, but not worth the price in my opinion. I had lamb shank, which was well marinated, but too much tendon and too chewy for me. Their house sauce is good, but would be much better if there is more. I prefer my meat a little juicier. Portion is just right. Good environment and location, despite the fact that you have to walk around the building to find the entrance (parking in the back). I probably won't go back as I could have a lot more better choices for that price. Service is slow, so better not go if you are super hungry."}
{"text":"Came on a week night for dinner and was a little disappointed in the food. I had really high expectations based on some great reviews I heard from friends.   The decor was very modern compared to the old place and it felt promising. I ordered some of the items recommended in reviews.   Duck wings were dry like every other review. Less meat as duck wings go. But their flavor was mediocre.   The duck breast had a very thick layer of fat on the skin and wasn't crispy at all. I felt like the restaurant really tried with the presentation and the pairings.   Scallop crudo was bland and tasted as if it was just defrosted from the freezer. Skip this one  I'm not sure if I would come back for dinner. Maybe for brunch as I've also heard good reviews, but who knows :)"}
{"text":"Had a birthday dinner last night. Reservations were made for a table of 15 - we had 3 people serving our group. Service was terrible - food took forever to come , things were forgotten , lots of mistakes on the bill. the wait staff was probably not trained to accommodate big groups. Friendly staff but not well trained. Food and ambience was decent but would probably not come back again."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend the appetizers - must have the brussel sprouts.   The bone marrow was also decent, although I prefer the black hoof.   The place overall is a bit on the pricey side for what it is. The mains and desserts weren't particularly innovative and so you can get the same dish at any restaurant for a better quality. I think overall the prices need to come down for the mains as the value isn't quite there.   The service was good the day I went. We were only two people and we stayed awhile to chat after our meal - didn't feel rushed. We also were mindful to glance at the door every now and than to make sure that there weren't people waiting."}
{"text":"Booked a table of 8 for my dads birthday today, received great friendly service from our server. We were seated quickly, food came out hot, we had oysters, the famous duck wings, beef tartare bone marrow for apps and a variety of mains, many came highly recommended by fellow yelpers:)   Loved the fact that everything had a fun Asian twist... the pork and pancakes had a ginger/scallion oil that we see often served with Chinese chicken dishes with a savoury pancake and a pork tenderloin... nice play on chicken and waffles. The beef tartare and bone marrow app tasted like pho which was unexpected but pretty delicious. Wished there was more to go around!  They also gave the birthday boy a complimentary dessert of an egg pudding with fresh fruit on a bed of crushed Oreo and sang for him:) we never felt rushed during our dinner and fully enjoyed ourselves and would recommend  this restaurant to our friends:)"}
{"text":"We were the first ones to arrive on Friday morning shortly after 11 AM opening. We were greeted and seated quickly, with the option to sit on the patio, dining, or lounge area. I ordered the Okonomiyaki ($18). It came out quickly and super hot. Super delicious and the portion is huge (3 pancakes, two eggs, pieces of bacon). The server checked up on us and made sure to refill our waters. Overall it was a great experience. By the time we left, around 12:30 or so, the dining area was half full and the patio was filling up quickly. If you were planning to go at 1 PM or so, I would recommend making reservations. There is also limited parking right behind the restaurant as well.   The only comment that I have is that they do actually offer coffee but it wasn't on their b'lunch menu. I wasn't aware until we finished our food and the server asked if we would like coffee or desserts. My recommendation to the restaurant is to have coffee listed on their menu - I would have definitely gotten one had I known!"}
{"text":"Went \"NextDoor\" to Main Street Unionville. Walked in and was greeted by a well organized hostess. Always checked up on by the friendly staffs; not once did we have to wave anyone down for service.   We ordered brussel sprouts, bone marrow with beef tartare, followed by some hot fried chicken and an Asian twist to pork belly pancakes. Overall, food was ok; the brussel sprouts and bone marrow were the stars of the night. Definitely worth a try if you're in the neighbourhood.   If anyone gets a chance to try their Caesar, please leave me a feedback!"}
{"text":"Located in Main Street Unionville , Next Door is the newest addition to the planing mill . It's got a small area on one side by the bar and a fancier dining room on the other . I made reservations on a Friday night and although it wasn't packed , the restaurant had consistent traffic all night.  Food 4/5 My friend and I tried the roasted bone marrow , fried brussels sprouts and torched salmon . The brussels sprouts was hands down my favourite dish of the night . The sprouts were slightly charred creating a nice crunch on the outside but was still soft on the inside . The maple balsamic vinaigrette was sweet yet tangy which complimented the slight bitterness of the crisped sprouts . The next dish we tried was the bone marrow which a lot of people raved about . I was pleasantly surprised by how it tastes like pho . The fattiness of the marrow was a little greasy but the bread accompanying it helps to cut the taste . My only complaint is the bread was too thick , making it hard to eat . The last dish was the torched salmon which was okay but quite frankly feels like it belongs in a sushi joint . The salmon was slightly torched meaning the pieces were more raw which is fine with me . The puffed rice makes the texture of each bite more interesting and cuts out the fish oil . However the togarashi aioili made the taste resemble a spicy salmon roll .  Service 3/5 Service was okay , nothing to rave about . Our server seemed semi new which is fine , but I wish he was more attentive . He seemed hesitant to make recommendations when asked and we had to consistently request for more water and such .  All in all Next Door is a great addition to the area . Definitely has a great atmosphere considering it's near the end of the area . I would love to come back and try more dishes ."}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here last night, and we will definitely be back!  We arrived early. Our table wasn't ready started with drinks at the bar in the lounge: Rouge River IPA - 5/5 Gin Fizz - 5+/5 (Wow!) Bar Service - 5/5 Ambiance: 5/5  A table opened up so we got seated in the restaurant early! :D Fried Brussel Sprouts - 5/5 (crunchy, fresh, great sauce) Mushroom Gyoza - 5/5 (also very fresh and full of interesting flavours) Duck - 4/5 (but super-tasty, but a little tough... maybe it should be served pre-sliced?) Cobia (fish) - 2/5... but let me explain...  The fish was where things went a bit sideways. It came out cold and very raw. We sent it back, and it came out a little better but still not fully edible. Here's where a good restaurant becomes a great restaurant... our server noticed we didn't eat it, immediately apologized that it didn't work out, and offered to take it off the bill. Then the manager came over to offer the same, and when we asked him about the fish we explained that they were still getting it right, and sometimes they experiment with new product that's tricky to perfect.  This attention to customer satisfaction is what separated NextDoor from almost every other restaurant in the region that really doesn't understand what giving great customer service means!  Try this place... try it more than once!"}
{"text":"Worked this morning and delayed me getting until now, 3:30, to have lunch. There's a Unionville Festival taking place. Seems like the festival has expanded this year but I would rather take a seat comfortably and enjoy my Saturday lunch. It's supposed to be a relaxing day. Found Next Door still has tables available at the patio. Sat down and ordered a glass of Spearhead beer and a hamburger.  The beer is cold and taste awesome. The hamburger is thick and juicy with a slice of ham and melted cheese in the bun. There are fries on the side. The fries are the thick cut fries. They are crispy which are a perfect partner to the cold beer.   The service is good as well. I requested to move to a table with more shade and the waiter is helpful to accommodate my request."}
{"text":"It's refreshing to dine at a restaurant with a creative menu, even more so at an uptown location. Nextdoor is slightly off the main area on Main Street, at the old mill plaza. This area is more quiet and the plaza has just enough parking. The interior is lined with grey wooden panels and feel very cozy.   I was intrigued by the grilled octopus entree and it did not disappoint! The food portions on its own are not huge, so it leaves plenty of room to order one or more appetizers."}
{"text":"Overall disappointing - food-wise. Came with a group and three of us were disappointed with our food given the price and other reviews we had seen.   I personally ordered two small and one medium sized plate for myself - the salmon pate, eggplant tostada, and roasted cauliflower. 1.) salmon pate was okay, not amazing or good. It came with these small sweet pancakes which didn't personally suit my taste with the salmon, nor did anyone at my table like it. 2.) eggplant tostada tasted like ceviche. Was okay, I wanted more of an eggplant flavour. 3.) I was hoping for a charred broken up cauliflower but I got a baked half head of cauliflower which was more raw than I was expecting and not as deeply seasoned as I hoped for. Went well with the pomegranate seeds, but not worth $14.  My friends ordered the hamburger, salmon entree, short ribs, and the Singapore crab. The best dish was the salmon - genuinely good and worth the price. I found the short ribs too sweet especially with the sweet potato. The burger was good but not worth $18 and it came with fries that were entirely too oversalted. The Singapore crab - also good but not worth the price, and too heavily breaded compared to true Singapore style crab.  Service was really good! Honestly, great. But given the food and the prices, I would come back."}
{"text":"Good place to adventure too, frequently regular not likely. Occasional visit definitely. Small menu but acceptable food. Price is reasonable for the locale."}
{"text":"4 stars on average, 3 when I went yesterday. I've come with friends and dates and tried dinner, hoppy hour, and brunch. Food is always good but when I went for dinner with my parents, it just so happened there was a big dinner party happening as well. As a result service was slow (but nice!) and food came out quite slow. It was also a lot louder than I remember it being.   The oysters were on point (they were also raspberry points) being super fresh and sweet. We ordered three entrees, and my favourite was the rainbow trout -- the skin was perfectly crispy and the meat cooked really nicely. My mother also loved the accompaniments, particularly the mushrooms were excellent.  Pork Chop looked impressive but was a bit bland unless mixed with the sauces (which is probably their intention).   Picanha had a nice mixture of fat cap and leaner areas to get a better taste of the meat.   We ordered two desserts as well, Basil & Strawberry as well as Coconut & Pineapple. The latter was definitely the winner with lots of cool textural components and wonderfully cooked pineapple with caramelised bits. The coconut ice cream is nice and cool, adding contrasting temperature components as well. The basil cake was ok but kinda boring in comparison!!   Drink program is solid too, bartender knows what he's doing. I think their best deal is still their Hoppy Hour, so I'll probably go back for that next time instead of dinner."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! Super casual, yet aesthetically pleasing. A perfect place for a date, birthday dinner, or casual hangout. I've been here twice now for both brunch and dinner and it did not disappoint, the staff here are very accommodating and friendly. Food wise, each of the dishes are unique and affordable!   For brunch, my girlfriend and I got the avocado toast (16) and the crab on brioche (18). Both were tasty, but I would highly recommend the crab on brioche just bc it's a specific dish offered by Next Door, and I've tried better avocado toast from elsewhere. Our server wasn't the happiest, but she made sure to come around from time to time to ask us if everything was okay.   As for dinner, we ordered the picanha (white been ragout with chorizo and chimichurri) and pan seared duck (maple duck demi glacé on a bed of mushroom barley roasted cauliflower). I would recommend both dishes, both worth it's price ($25) - very flavourful and the barley rice was cooked perfectly (very chewy).   FYI - it's best to make reservations during peak hours, I didn't realize how popular this place was, especially tucked away behind the red barn building with the water wheel!!!"}
{"text":"Consistent quality for brunch. Everything on Dinner menu was good.  Only thing that is horrible it is your burger at the dinner. Plz improve your fries and the burger or just get rid of it on your menu !"}
{"text":"One of the manager/owner reach out to me after seeing my review and offered a meal on them because they want to improve on the previous issues. This review is not endorsed nor biased in anyway.  I think they have done great since my first experience at NextDoor. They addressed many of the issues such as the lack of flavours in some dishes and the dress code. We ordered the roasted bone marrow dish again and the beef tartare was nicely flavoured. We tried a few new dishes (roasted spaghetti squash and torched sashimi salmon) and they were delightful.   I am so happy to see NextDoor improve themselves because like I said, this place has so much potential!"}
{"text":"The food and service were delightful, and the healthy appetizers were unexpectedly delicious, who would ever expect brussels sprouts to be this delectable even for a 13-year-old? He said it was his favorite part of the night. I have been to six different incarnations of this restaurant and this is my favorite so far, I just hope that they get more walk in traffic and great word-of-mouth because they deserve it, and at the time at 5 PM on a sunny beautiful spring Friday night, there were only two customers and 22 staff. Not that I'm saying they were overly intrusive, they were awesome, just the perfect amount of friendly. Plus I love the renovation, the colors and the lighting fixtures and the tables are perfect. Good luck, you deserve it, we plan to return often as it's 30 second bike from our house."}
{"text":"First time here since they opened. Atmosphere is good and they have a lounge and dining area. They have a small menu and not something very appealing to me. So I ordered their ND burger and also the octopus appetizer. Burger tastes good but nothing too special. Very juicy and their sauce has a tint of sweet in it. The octopus appetizer also taste good, but they slice it thin and only at the bottom. The top is dice potatoes and come with salad. Again the octopus itself is tender and the sauce is tasty, but I expect more or thicker pieces of octopus. Overall it's still good. Heard their brunch menu is good so maybe should try that next time."}
{"text":"I have nothing bad to say about our experience here. The food was great, really unique menu and fresh ingredients. Our table shared the brussels sprouts, scallop crudo, the duck, the sashimi salmon and the octopus. We loved everything, especially the octopus and the salmon. The salmon rice was like rice crispies, nothing we've ever had or expected. Service was also amazing. Our server was professional, informative and super sweet. When she found out it was my birthday she gave us a strawberry shortcake, which was amazing by the way. I think this is definitely now one of my favourite restaurants in Markham, will definitely be back to try their super Insta worthy brunch!"}
{"text":"I had the next door burger and it was really good, however the rosemary wedges werent really \"wedges they were like REALLY thickly cut fries that were somewhat deep fried. I was also not prepared to pay the price (i think the burger was 18$) but that might just be on me"}
{"text":"Ah, NextDoor the hero Main Street Unionville has needed and the Hero it deserves. When I first began my Yelp journey Unionville was one of my favourite spots to frequent in the 905. Quaint, picturesque, historic. But over time I'd come to realize that the businesses here were also stuck in the past. Many are doing the same old same with little innovation and few new businesses have really entered over the past 5 years to give it boost.   But in the last year, several new businesses have begun to dig in here attracting a younger demographic while still providing value and quality for the longtime regulars.   Nextdoor epitomizes this new wave, this NEXTgen of Unionville in all the best ways. To begin they've secured an amazing location in the old mill location taking over a majority of the main floor that overlooks the pond and fountain. And what's more, they've injected modern style and design into a space that previously was looking tired and drab.   A massive multipurpose elegant main dining room that works as both an event space or a brunch/lunch spot is only matched by their more rustic and casual bar space.   The other area that they've excelled at is bringing innovative, creative dishes to the area that bring together classic dishes with local on trendy flavours (namely Asian fusion) which the Markham market is abuzz about.   Many have visited for their brunch offerings and it remains the most popular reason to visit, and now that they're offering Brunch 7-days a week (yep) you have reason to visit on any day that ends in a '-y'. With dishes such as Okonomiyaki pancakes, and white chocolate French toast (which comes with cotton candy floss and a strawberry popsicle - WHAT?) they're delivering a one-two punch of plate aesthetics (read: Instagram/Yelp photo-worthy) and bold flavours.  On my visit yesterday I wanted something really tasty and delicious so my server recommended that if I enjoy the taste of lamb (I do... obviously), that I give their Shakshuka dish a try. This dish with African origins combines Spiced tomato sauce, two 64 Degree eggs, lamb merguez (sausages), sesame seeds in a hearty tomato stew with grilled sourdough bread on the side for dipping.  Result: HOLY SH...AKSHUKA! (see what I did there). This was an incredible dish, one that I would have never ordered on my own but with the strong recco I was thrilled with the result. A little spicy, but not overly acidic despite the tomato sauce, amazing sausages, and the Sourdough bread slices were to die for (I wish I had 5 more pieces). This was the PERFECT hearty meal for a chilly fall day.  To finish I had a Montecristo latte (with Kahlua) and it was fantastic as well, they've got a pro espresso machine behind the bar that is dolling out excellent coffee/espresso so definitely give this a try as well!  Amazing experience, cannot wait to try more of their menu  Eatcrest Out  *** Couple of additional notes *** \"Hoppy Hour\" Monday - Friday 3:00pm - 6:00pm  1/2 Price Oysters, 25% Off All Nibbles, $1 Oz Wine, $5 Draft Pints  They also have local Markham brewery Rouge River on tap, so support local and give their season tap a try!"}
{"text":"A \"meh\" for the food and a \"good\" for the drinks available. The Belgium beer is a must try.  For the less expensive prices than other restaurants in the area, the quality of food was ok. In our party of 5, one friend had the skirt steak and the meat was tough. I had the lamb dish and it was probably the best dish of the night. The bone marrow was interesting, but not spectacular, a little greasy.  Other dishes were not memorable.  The styling of food came off a bit pretentious and over-playing the \"fusion cuisine\" card. Spend on the drinks, don't over-spend on the food."}
{"text":"Having mistakenly gone to Smash the first time around thinking it was this place, we made it to NDs just in time for their happy hour from 3-6.   We ordered half a dozen of their French kiss oysters , half a dozen of their raspberry pointe oysters, the bone marrow app, ahi tuna app  and duck wings.   Ambience: cool & hip on the lounge side, 3 words: modern lumberjack chic, plain Jane on the dining  Oysters: really fresh and tasty, at 50% they were good value and good eating  Duck wings: Omg this tasted like rehydrated jerky. Or something a dog would be given to chew on. Eating this was like trying to gnaw apart driftwood - so dry and overly crispy and definitely overcompensating with too much mayo. Yes we know your trying to hide the butchered duck meat underneath. Really disappointing as the waiter touted this as one of the OGs since this place opened...What ??  Bone marrow: a much needed 180 from the duck wings. Really good! Creative presentation of the beef tartare stuffed in a large piece of bone. The oil that collected in the hollow of the inside of the home was great to dip the bread it and was absolutely succulent.   Ahi tuna: $16 for 6 chunks of tuna in a kind or yogurt based sauce. Interesting sure. But not notable. And also, kind of a rip off. Wait what did this taste like again? See I've already forgotten.   Final note: I would come back for the oysters and bone marrow and to chill in the lounge"}
{"text":"I've come here for brunch and dinner a handful of times and I'm never disappointed. Ideal spot for weekend brunch since you can stroll down Main Street afterwards and get ice cream at the Firehall to satisfy your cravings. Highly recommend making reservations as it's quite a popular restaurant.  When people ask me what I like best, I can honestly say there's not one thing on the menu you can go wrong with. The mushroom toast is vegetarian and one of my go-to choices. If you're feeling sushi, their poke bowl has a great mix and you can always substitute ingredients out if you have any allergies. I'm personally not a fan of bone marrow but my friends who have tried it say it's quite flavourful. I love their spin to dishes - especially the Japanese pancakes as well as fried toast topped with fruit popsicle and cotton candy (you've gotta have a sweet tooth for that one!) If it's your first time visiting I'd recommend going for brunch, and then on your second visit try their dinner menu. I've had their grilled octopus for dinner which was a perfect app to share."}
{"text":"Came here for our christmas dinner as we read some good reviews on yelp. Overall the experience was pretty good !!! I would definitely come back again.  We ordered Ahi Tuna Crudo, half a dozen of fresh oysters and tortellini to share between 2 people.  Pricing is fair, our meal cost us about $60 with tax and tip in. Overall the menu items average range from $14 to $28. The food is delicious, but i find the portions are kind of small. They also have a limited dessert menu with 3 items only + coffee / tea.  The service is great, nice ambience. Nice restaurant on main street uninonville. I would like to come back and try their brunch menu next time."}
{"text":"I have always been a big fan of having Brunch at Smash Kitchen and when I hear that they're opening a new restaurant, I just had to try it. NextDoor Restaurant is located in the Old Mill on Main Street which gave the restaurant a very rustic atmosphere.   For brunch, I had the Shakshuka and my mom had \"The Safe Side\". Our food came very quickly but that was mainly because it was fairly quiet at noon time. The Shakshuka was very good. You could really taste the freshness in the tomatoes, but it is a bit spicy. However, the entree only comes with two slices and the portion is fairly generous, so I recommend that you pay extra to get an extra slice of toast to accompany the dish. \"The Safe Side\" is just your typical breakfast combo with eggs, mushrooms, tomatoes and bacon. I personally didn't try much of that entree but my mom did say she enjoyed the mushrooms and tomatoes very much!   Overall, I think this is a great addition to Smash Kitchen branch of restaurants. Their rustic food is perfect for any foodies who enjoy trying new restaurants. I highly recommend this place. I look forward to trying new brunch items in the future!"}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant. Atmosphere was alright, but service was excellent. Our waiter Jack made some great recommendation for drinks and keep checking on us from time to time. Once he realized my mom was visiting from afar, he brought us special dessert! We had the bone marrow as appetizer, the bone marrow itself was lacking a bit of seasoning but the tartare on top was delicious, probably gonna get the tartare next time. Main course we had the pan seared duck, made just right, tender and juicy and the mushroom barley was so flavourful. We also had the Seabass and it was crispy on the outside and cook to perfection, and I had many seabass before and this is by far the best. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Location/Service Located on Main St Unionville, it's by the waterfall gazebo area. Plenty of parking within the plaza and around Main St, do note it does get very busy during rush hour and nice weather.  Love the interior decor. It's simple, yet modern and cozy. There are two seating arrangements, one is for bigger groups with a romantic feeling and the other is high tables with a bar feeling to it.  I've read some reviews regarding service. I went here for a birthday celebration, a party of 25 people! And I am very satisfied on the service. The waiters explained the menu nicely, made sure we were taken after especially when they have to serve that many people on the same table.   Food I had a sharing appetizer of Roasted Bone Marrow (~$13). This is served along side of bread as a spread. The dish itself it very good, love the fattiest of the bone marrow and the crunchiness of the bread, a good complimentary.  As for the main, I tried the Lamb Sirloin (which could now be Roasted Lamb Leg). The Lamb was done to a good level, although it was a little tough. But I really liked the hummus and how it mixes well with the feta, turnip and cauliflower. Initially I thought the portion looked a little small, but it was quite filling and I enjoyed the combination of the ingredients.   Overall, I had a good time at Next Door - especially when you have good vibes and good company. I've been meaning to try their brunch, hopefully I can write another review for it soon."}
{"text":"Pretty sweet place if I may say so myself among the other bigillion positive reviews! Came here a few days ago and the experience was wonderful!  We were greeted right away and we made reservations for 11:30am as we thought the place might be busy but it wasn't too bad when we arrived. There were several tables both indoors and at the patio being occupied so it was definitely busy. However, seeing as so many tables were being served at once, it also meant that this place was fairly big and can hold quite a few people. The interior was quite pleasing to the eye, an exquisite modern look with a mix of the past (whatever word you want to use) and comfort.  Service was perfect and our waitress checked up on us sufficiently. Our food also came out in a timely manner which was another plus despite how busy it was.  Finally the food itself was quite interesting and tasty. The only thing was, as expected, their portions were not meant for when you are starving...at least for me anyway. I came for brunch and hadn't eaten since the morning soooo I was hoping for something with a good portion size. But maybe this place is more about aesthetics than their portion sizes? That being said, price was all right and would I have gotten another dish? Maybe, if I was a baller... ;) I got the Mushroom Toast while my friend got the Okonomiyaki. Mine tasted delicious throughout; mushrooms were yummy, sauce complimented them well and the toast....the toast....ohhhh it was THE BEST TASTING toast I've tasted at restaurants who do toast-whatever! Maybe it wasn't made in any special way BUT it definitely tasted different! According to my friend, the Okonomiyaki flavours were good to start but it got rich and strong/overwhelming near the end. Nonetheless, food overall was perfect!  Would I be back again? For the aesthetics? Im joking. Yeah, I'd be back to try a few more of their other dishes and I'd definitely like to see what their dinner menu is like. I'll just be sure not to be starving next time..."}
{"text":"Delicious food and excellent service!  I just want to start off by saying, NextDoor offers such amazing service! Our server was patient and attentive - he made sure everyone was happy and satisfied all throughout our dinner. He even offered to help us take pictures because we were celebrating a birthday there.  We started off with fried brussel sprouts, bone marrow and scallops. Out of all the appies i would definitely recommend the bone marrow.  After eating all the goodness of the bone marrow, you can do a shot where the vodka shot is poured along the hollow bone and into your mouth. I'm not sure how it tastes, but it seems like a fun way to take a shot!   For the main course I had the salmon with puffed rice and it was definitely the best salmon I've had at a restaurant.  The fish was cooked about rare/medium rare (kind of like torched salmon sushi) and was perfect for me. The combination of the sauce, seaweed, and rice was just delicious!   Near the end of our dinner, a bigger party was coming so they needed our table and wanted to move us to a different table.  Our server was extremely apologetic and even offered us a pitcher of sangria on the house.  Overall, I had an amazing experience and can't wait to come back for brunch!"}
{"text":"Was hesitate to come because of bad experience at Smash, but it is surprisingly good!   I like every single dish we ordered today.  Porched sashimi salmon, burger, duck wings, duck live plate (favourite of the night). We will come back again for brunch or another dinner~"}
{"text":"Came for Brunch on a Sunday morning.  Its always a pleasant feeling hanging out at Main Street Unionville.  Next Door has a comfortable setting and their brunch menu is sufficiently diverse without having too many items to choose from.  I tried a little of my friends Acai Bowl and that's probably my favourite.  Ice cold and refreshing.  I might order that next time.  I had the Crab on Brioche and it's surprisingly filling for what looked like a small dish.  Poached eggs were done very well.  Smooth whites and the yolk still runny.  Service was really good.  Always around to refilling waters and coffees and it wasn't just the one server per table setup, I felt like they were a team helping each other out.  Makes for  a much more efficient service.  Would definitely come back again, especially in the summertime."}
{"text":"Went there on a weekend evening for a friend's birthday celebration.  The place is not huge and definitely recommend anyone to make reservations,  especially for weekends.   The overall experience was great!  We ordered oysters and bone marrow for appetizers. I got a torched sashimi salmon for myself,  but also tried my friends' dishes,  including the duck, lamb sirloin,  spaghetti squash,  and squid,  which I thought all tasted pretty good.   The salmon portion looked a bit small to me at first,  but it was just right given we also shared the appetizers and each had a piece of cake for dessert. The salmon was quite juicy and torched just right.   We also brought a bottle of wine and they charged us $15 bottling fee.  The only thing was that the place was a bit noisy.  It would be difficult to talk if you come with a large group."}
{"text":"Ive been here 3x since theyve opened and everytime its a 5-star experience. Friendly servers, and beautiful venue, with easy parking in an equally lovely neighbourhood.   Ive been here for all 3 meals; brunch lunch and dinner and all have been amazing  For brunch, I had the lamb shakshuka, and its was very tasty and spicy, which complemented the gamey lamb sausages.   For lunch, i had the burger, which was really good. Interesting flavours in the patty, with fresh tasting condements.  For dinner, i tried the shashimi bowl, which i was pretty skeptical, but I enjoyed it. I dont think the fish is fresh, but it didnt have to be cuz the sauce complemented the texture of the salmon.  The price point is reasonable and the service is great, so of course I will return when im im the area"}
{"text":"The interior of the restaurant is very nice it's has sort of a rustic but bright interior, which I think matches the area. The service is very good with attentive servers who don't hover but can always be reached.   The food itself was about average for the safe side breakfast. The eggs were slightly under done for sunny side up (egg whites was still clear near the yolk). The sour dough toast was good but I felt like it have been accompanied by butter or been less big. The mushrooms were just button mushrooms and didn't enhance the dish. Overall the safe breakfast is not something I would recommend. My partner got the shakshuka and it was this delightful blend of sweet, acidic, and spicy. Again this was accompanied by the large sour dough toast and the eggs were slightly underdone for the poached eggs. This dish gave me hope for this place and I'm much more curious to come back again and try the okonomiyaki or something more adventurous in hope for a better experience.   The juices we got to accompany the meal were a fresh pressed pear and the daily special of carrot and mango juice. The pear juice was a little sweeter than my liking and likely was sweetened with mainly apple juice . My preference would be the Asian pear juices you would get at fruit jungle which looks like it's no longer at it location in FMP. The specialty carrot and mango juice was much better. It was subtle but not too subtle as to not taste the individual flavours."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night with a late reservation and sat in the patio to take advantage of the beautiful weather in late September.   I'll start of with the positives. The service was great. Our waitress was very attentive and she came to check on us at the perfect times. I realized I left my wallet at the restaurant while ordering cakes at H Cafe. As I walked past the patio seating area, a waitress outside immediately informed me that my wallet was at the front desk. As I walked inside, a restaurant staff member was already on the phone trying to call me. From a service perspective, I would definitely give them 5 stars!    Atmosphere wise, I would give it a 3 star as it was a tad too dim. Some added string lights would make a world of a difference. The fountain was actually quite loud and distracting for such a beautiful setting. There were also quite a few spiders along the deck railing.  We ordered the small salumi board ($14) as our shared appetizer. It came with bread, which was a letdown as it was dry and lacked the doughy taste and texture. The salumi board felt overwhelmingly salty after a few pieces, even when eaten with the bread.  For our mains, I ordered the torched sashimi salmon ($15) and my husband ordered the grilled octopus ($17). The portions were quite small for a main dish. After my initial bite, I thought the torched sahimi salmon had a good flavour profile and the wild puff rice added a nice crunch. But as I ate more of it, it became increasingly salty. I felt the chef was a bit heavy handed on the togarashi aioli. The grilled octopus was quite tender and again had a good flavour profile. Similar to my dish though, it also became too salty as he had more of it.   Overall, I think this restaurant has some good potential. However, the flavours would need to be refined a bit for us to return for dinner, although we are interested in trying the brunch menu!"}
{"text":"I've been to Next Door on 2 separate occasions, one for dinner and one for brunch. But this review is based upon my most recent visit to Next Door for brunch.  Environment: Open and spacious with big windows with a modern rustic interior design. The space is great for intimate dates, birthdays, anniversaries or any big group gatherings.   Food: The okonomiyaki pancakes were delicious. Price was a little bit on the pricey side in relation to portion size. Only 3 stacks of pancakes for $18. But the taste was great. Pancakes were fluffy and soft with generous toppings. I also tried their Green Tea pancakes with tofu mousse, chocolate crumbles and supposedly pickled cantaloupes. I didn't like cantaloupes so it was nice that they could substitute them with strawberries instead. I was a slightly disappointed that the so-called green tea pancakes were actually plain pancakes with green tea sauce on top and not actually green tea flavoured pancakes. But, the combination with tofu mousse and green tea sauce was well done. Tofu mousee was light with subtle tofu flavour. The green sauce was not overly sweet so the entire dish didn't feel too heavy.  Service: accommodating, patience and friendly. Our hostess was knowledgeable in regards to the menu items and made sure we didn't have any dietary restrictions."}
{"text":"After seeing all the good reviews, we had to give this place a try for dinner.  The restaurant is a good size with plenty of seating inside and a nice sized patio overlooking a tiny little pond.  Luckily there's also parking behind the plaza (albeit not a lot) because parking at unionville main street can be a nightmare during the summertime.   The service was good.   Our server took time to explain their menu and the specials.   Their menu is simple with a handful of appetizers and entrées.  I liked that they list whether their items are vegetarian, gluten free, etc.   Our server was also attentive enough to ask about allergies.  They also have a kids menu, but you need to ask the server.  We ordered four items:  BONE MARROW: such fatty goodness.  If you're ordering this, don't expect something healthy.  It had plenty of bread to smear the bone marrow then top with the beef tartar.   The flavour definitely had a Vietnamese flare with peanuts, cilantro and chili.  I thought the bread was a bit on the hard side.  Highly recommended.   TORCHED SALMON: I thoroughly enjoyed the dish.   The salmon was delicious, it wasn't too dry as it was a torched tartar.   The puffed rice was an unique touch which I've never seen before.   Highly recommend this dish.   DUCK LIVER PATE: I never expected a small pot of pate.   However, what I would never expect was that it was a duck liver pate brulee!   There was a nice crunchy layer you need to break through to get to the pate.   Layer your bread with the pate and top with some caramelized onions for a delicious starter.  BURGER: husband had this.   He said it was nothing special.   It was a good sized burger and I noticed a lot of bacon in the burger.   It came with chips and a side of greens.   I'm glad I didn't order this.   I can't comment on the taste, but I didn't hear any complaints from the hubs.   Nextdoor is a wonderful addition to the Markham area."}
{"text":"Fist off, I don't usually take the time to leave a positive review... but this place was phenomenal! Service was outstanding and the food was of the highest quality. Definitely would recommend the Singaporean Chile crab. Also, the red sangria was smooth and balanced. I cannot preach about how great the service was! Upon leaving every staff member acknowledged us and we were attended to hand and foot by our server. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The holidays are amoung us, so it's time to get together and enjoy one another. As such, the lovely folk at my gym rented a room at NextDoor restaurant, for an evening of food and drink.  NextDoor is a very new restaurant along iconic Main Street Unionville Markham. They opened this past summer, with an obvious desire to serve dishes with non-traditional twists. The room that we rented, which included the bar, was large enough to seat approximately 30 of us, with room left over to walk around and mingle. For visualization's sake, there is a second main room in the restaurant, which I would guess can seat at least just as many, maybe more.  Since we were such a large group, we had a reduced menu available to us. I chose to start with the duck wings, because... well come on... DUCK wings. I had a bit of a roller coaster of emotions with this dish. At first my anticipation was embarrassingly high, which probably contributed to the slight bit of disappointment when I found that they only serve you two wings. You're not going to All-Stars, so don't expect wings by the pound. The wings are served with kewpie mayo, Japanese barbecue sauce, fried shallots, and red chili peppers. I'd summarize the wings as interesting. Duck is apparently much gamier than chicken, so don't expect succulent meat. Secondly, the flavours were very unique. Not quite something that I was crazy for, but those around me quite enjoyed them.  For the main, Nashville Fried Chicken was the easy decision. You'll be served two pieces of fried chicken, atop a bed mash potatoes, corn, and greens, with a spicy brown sauce to top it all. Aside from my minor complaint of not-so-special mashed potatoes, I really enjoyed this dish. The fried chicken is well cooked and crispy, and the corn/greens combo is welcome addition. Things really get adventurous with the spicy brown sauce. I couldn't tell you what the sauce is made with, but it adds a genuine amount of spice to the dish that scoffs at the regular Canadian standards for spicy. Think more Indian food mild spicy. It's not crazy, but you're not left guessing whether you ordered the spicy version or not. (*clap clap*)  The meal finished with some strawberry shortcake. Not much to say here. It was nice.  The staff are welcoming and sociable, and the food steps a little out of the norm. If you're looking for something new, NextDoor might be your next stop."}
{"text":"Favourites:  -Fried Brussels Sprouts -ND Double Cheese Burger  Average, but would not order again: -ND Poke   The service was friendly and prompt, but this was on a Monday afternoon and only 3 tables were filled (I can't speak for the service during rushes or on the weekend.   I like the food at ND more than their sister restaurant, Smash. I will definitely be back to tackle more items on the menu.   A note that may not matter to most, but worth mentioning as a new parent: The washrooms do not have a changing table (counter space is also limited, making an unexpected diaper change insanely difficult). It's nice eating out somewhere other than the dreaded chain restaurants, so it was dissapointing that the facilities were not properly equipped for famillies (especially since the restaurant is so spacious). But the delicious brussels sprouts alone is worth sitting through a meal with my daughter's poop on me. Oh well."}
{"text":"Next Door is one of the hottest new places in Markham and it is a trendy Canadian style tapa place with an Asian twist. For the locals, I am sure it is a much welcomed addition to the food scene in Main Street, Unionville.  Wines are offered in 3 prices - 6 ounces/9 ounces/full bottle.  The selections were not large, but adequate.  A good variety of beers on tap were available, including two of my favorites, Heineken and Stella Artois.  We ordered three items to share:  FRIED BRUSSELL SPROUTS:  The sprouts were so fresh that even after it's been fried, I could still taste the freshness and sweetness of the core of the sprouts. They were tossed in a slightly sweet and super yummy balsamic vinaigrette, topped with some bacon bits (hence not marked as a vegetarian dish with a \"V\"), and served with a creamy aioli dipping sauce. This dish was almost perfect except that it might have been slightly over cooked as some of the sprouts appeared to be burnt.  MUSHROOM GYOZA:  There were many items on the menu that offered a slice of Asian fusion and this is one of those.  Japanese style gyozas were stuffed with Western style sautéed chopped mushrooms (almost a puree) and served on a bed of red cabbage (an Irish twist, maybe?)  The dish was accompanied with slices of oyster mushrooms and a sprinkle of edamame beans. This was our most favorite dish of the night!  FLAT IRON STEAK: It was perfectly grilled to medium rare just like we ordered.  The steak was good quality meat and it was tender and flavorful. It was topped with a salad which, at first glance, looked like coleslaw.  But it was actually a thinly sliced Brussel sprouts Caesar salad.  It was delicious and memorable.  In fact, it was more memorable than the steak itself.  Although the steak was good, the seasonings (chimichurri?) was a bit too strong and we found that too overwhelming.  Service has been friendly and attentive.  Place was cool and hip.  Food was great.  We are ready to be back the next time we are in the GTA."}
{"text":"This place was the PERFECT brunch spot. It has beautiful decor, spacious  great service and amazing food! Everything about this place was so aesthetic, I will definitely come back.   I got the Okonomiyaki, which is basically japanese pancakes. These pancakes were AMAZING. Every single bite was so savoury, I had dreams about it afterwards! The actual pancakes are thick, soft and fluffy and surprisingly salty! At first I was weirded out, but it was perfect combo with the sweet eggs and mushrooms it came with. Note that this dish usually comes with bacon, I just swapped it for mushrooms instead!  Some of the drinks were better than others. I got the watermelon special of the day and loved it. We also got the Blueberry Mint Lavender Juice and didn't like that at all, it tasted too much like blackberry. The prices are a bit on the high side, but all the dishes which we got was super filling and we even had to pack some, so I would say the price was worth it!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family for the celebration of my mom's birthday. I called to have a reservation and was surprised I was asked detailed questions. From my allergies, how is the party splitting the bill to even if I was coming to bring a cake of my own. They also provided all birthday parties a free slice of complimentary desert. It was brownie with toffee chunks and cream.   The restaurant had a nice and relaxing ombiance with medium to dim lighting which sometimes made pictures a bit too dark but nothing a little flash can't fix.   I ordered their salmon which was delicious. I felt like I had various flavors and textures that complimented the dish. It was a half glazed salmon so it's the perfect finish between raw and grilled.   I would come back again for their patio season!"}
{"text":"Had a Father's day brunch here.   Parking was convenient and we were greeted by a very warm staff.  Staff was very helpful and had good suggestions for what to eat.  Food was delicious.   My wife had the poke bowl, which was refreshing and flavourful.   There is no kids menu but buying the baby some eggs and toast was only $4.  I had the Japanese sauce (sorry don't remember the name) poached eggs on fresh pancakes.   Pancakes were done well and the flavour really meshed well with the sauce.  Would definately go again and try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Friendly staffs, nice comfortable restaurant 1 star.   Menu is creative and options fit the cultural neighborhood in Markham. 1 star  Another star goes to their location and it is just nice to walk out to Main St Unionville after eating.  However, food quality can be improved and the orders we got are quite salty. We are not sure if the chef was aware but we notified the waitress and we didn't get any offer to fix it  So we think we will probably not return to eat again. Sorry."}
{"text":"Been here twice and i must say they have some pretty unique dishes and they are all pretty delicious. Patio is quite nice beside the pond as well - but bring mosquito spray just in case! Presentation of the food is great as well. I noticed they have a happy hr menu that id def come back to try!"}
{"text":"I came here with some girlfriends after work for dinner.  One of them had tried the food at NextDoor and they said it was good.  The restaurant had a very quiet and romantic atmosphere and it was nicely decorated with holiday decor and they had two separate seating areas - the bar and the dining area.  The dining area was very rustic with windows all around.  We had reservations coming into the restaurant which was good because the restaurant was pretty busy, especially on a snowy winter evening.  We were seated right away and was told that our server would be with us shortly.  Our server came by to give us our menus and introduced himself to us while he gave us a couple minutes to view the menu.  We were discussing amongst the three of us to see what we wanted to order and we decided we'd share a couple of plates so we could try a bit of everything.  We decided to try the Octopus Carpaccio (Nduja aioli / cilantro pistou / yukon potato salad / pickled onions / fried garlic), Fried Brussels Sprouts (Maple balsamic vinaigrette / double smoked bacon / parmesan aioli), Ahi Tuna Crudo (Tuna Confit / coconut lime cream sauce / avocado cream / tobiko / pickled shimeji mushrooms / squid ink tempura), Torched Sashimi Salmon (Maple soy / puffed wild rice / pickled cucumbers / togarashi aioli), and Pan Seared Duck Honey cinnamon glazed / mushroom barley / roasted cauliflower / pickled pearl onions / maple duck demi glace).  We all ended up ordering a glass of wine as well.  I'm not joking, but all the items that we ordered from the menu were delicious!  I think my top three favourites were the Octopus Carpaccio and the Torched Sashimi Salmon and the Pan Seared Duck.  Then again, I'm all about meats/protein and seafood... so I'm kind of biased.  All the protein and seafood were fresh and tender.  They did a very good job combining all the ingredients and sauces to ensure you had an explosion of flavours while eating each dish.  It was also my first time trying Brussels Sprouts and I was not disappointed at all.. It was so yummy and for someone who isn't a fan of vegetables, that is definitely something I'd eat again if I go back.  It tasted very similar to kale chips and I love kale chips.  The portions of each dish are smaller - in my opinion, but because we shared all the dishes, our stomaches were satisfied by the end of it. The presentation of each dish was spectacular - which makes the experience that much better.  The only downside to our dinner was that I thought our server was kind of rushing us in taking our order and getting our bills.  He wasn't as engaging as I would have hoped but he was able to recommend us some of the most popular dishes and offered us coffee and desserts.  But I still give NextDoor a five-star because the food was something I'd definitely come back for.  Thanks NextDoor for the fabulous food and until next time, I'll see you next time!"}
{"text":"I was so excited when this restaurant opened as it mirrored one of my favorite restaurants in Markham -- Inspire. NextDoor is another upscale modern gem in the heart of Main Street Unionville and if you love good flavors, unique fusion dishes, breathtaking presentation, and an ever-changing playful menu you'll DEFINITELY want to bookmark this place. I've been here for dinner, brunch, and blunch (what they call brunch on weekdays) and I've enjoyed my meal every time.  For dinner with my family of 6, I had to make reservations beforehand as they get quite busy around dinner time. We shared the oysters and octopus carpaccio for appetizers (or \"nibblers\" as they call them) -- both were pretty good but a little on the pricier side. Then for mains, we had the torched sashimi salmon, chicken roulade, nextdoor burger, pan seared duck, braised short rib, and another seasonal dish. My main was the torched sashimi salmon and it was absolutely amazing. The texture was perfect, the flavors never overpowered, and the puffed wild rice added a nice crunch with the tender salmon. Everyone at the table was pretty pleased with their meal. We also got a pitcher of sangria which was not bad but nothing amazing.   For brunch/blunch, I've tried the okonomiyaki (huge portion but super yummy!), mushroom grilled cheese (this is amazing if the soup of the day is something tomato based), the crab on brioche, and the ND pancakes. I wasn't too impressed with the pancakes as they sounded a lot better than they actually were but I'd highly recommend everything else. Most of their savoury items seem to spot-on while their sweet brunch items are more for the Instagram than the stomach.  All in all, a terrific restaurant that I seem to always come back to!"}
{"text":"Next door offers a high grade culinary experience with a trendy and sophisticated scene that more typically exists in parts of downtown Toronto: King West or Yorkville. This restaurant raises the stock of the comfortably chic Unionville Main St. and if you are a foodie you will be rewarded. The chef is masterful and the menu is inventive - Next Door delivers on all fronts. Good for all occasions all the time."}
{"text":"Another new brunch edition to the Markham area has arrived! Foodies rejoice because the aesthetics and food of this restaurant are very photogenic.  If you come on weekends you'll be able to sample their brunch fare. Most offerings range between $14-18 and a sizeable cocktail menu as well.   Shakshuka - this dish really has a kick to it so those with a low spice tolerance should probably avoid this. The eggs were softly poached and helped mellow out the heat. I found the sourdough be to a little burnt for my liking but the dish itself was great.  Poke bowl - the poke bowl had a mix of salmon, edamame, seaweed salad, tobiko, nori, sesame seeds, avocado and spicy mayo over sushi rice. I think I could have gone without the seaweed salad and the rice was a little hard for my liking. I didnt find this dish to be that spectacular.  Service was friendly but a little slow since our server was covering two rooms.   When it comes to food trends, Next Door has it all for brunch. Whether you're craving some avocado toast, acai bowls, poke, okonomiyaki or shakshuka they have it all. There's plenty of free parking nearby and you won't have to wait an obnoxiously long time to get seated. Will probably come back to see how their dinner menu is."}
{"text":"Visited around 12:00 for Sunday brunch. My party had reservations but space did not seem to be a problem as the patio area was open as well. I was the earliest of my party to arrive but the server was extremely friendly and helped me decide my order before everyone else got in. For the record, recommendations from our server were: Okonomyaki, ND Poke, and White Chocolate French Toast. Of course, our group ended up getting all of those as well as the Pork & Beans and Cheeseburger.   I had the ND Poke and it was a good experience for my first Poke bowl. The mayo mixed well with all the toppings (salmon, avocado, seaweed, edamame) and overall it was a very nice light taste. The rice was a decent portion and none of the toppings were overly dominant. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their dishes AND photos as well (especially the Pork & Beans).   Location wise there is parking around the restaurant and around the Main St Unionville area, and the decor was simple and classy. Have not tried the partner restaurant (Smash Kitchen) as other reviews have mentioned, but if the experience is similar, would definitely be interested!"}
{"text":"Service was amazing and so was the food. We went on a Monday night around 9pm where there were half price snacks priced at $5.00,  craft beer for $6.00 and half priced oysters (originally $3.00 a piece, minimum order half a dozen) . We had the beef tartar which was amazing aside from the fact that the chip was a little stale. The corn was amazing- heavy but good to share, the guacamole with sea urchin was interesting but I dont think there was enough urchin to taste anything. Nevertheless, everything was tasty. The horseradish that came with it was very fresh and flavorful which packed a punch in a good way. Overall, I am very satisfied with this cute spot and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch during the exotic car show weekend and made reservation via YP Dine.  We were greeted by the friendly staff as soon as we walked in and was seated right away.  I love the interior design of the space, it's very sleek and vibrant, very interestingly incorporated in a historical neighbourhood.    Ordered the Okonomiyaki and ND Poke off the brunch menu.  The Okonomiyaki was just lukewarm when it was brought to our table and the poached eggs were pretty much fully cooked, which was a bit disappointing.  As for the ND Poke, it was not bad but wish there was an option to have brown rice.  I find the price range of food is at the higher end.  Overall, it was still a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is listed as Canadian because I can assure you, the vast majority of the items on their menu are not what I would consider Canadian. Asian fusion would be more accurate because the current tag is very misleading. Feel free to let me know how poke bowls, mushroom gyoza and okonomiyaki are Canadian.   I came here right on time for my reservation and our table wasn't ready for another 5-10 minutes. The restaurant wasn't even full at this time. It was as if they weren't even expecting us. There were 3 hostess/hosts at the counter - I would have expected at least one of them would have checked for reservations???   Nothing much to say about their food. It's looks good but it's nothing special. It didn't meet my expectations. This place is way too overhyped on yelp/instagram. I'd recommend literally going next door next time."}
{"text":"THE FOOD- Went here for brunch on a Saturday with my husband & another couple. All of our dishes (the crab toast, shakshuka and pancake of the day) were beautifully plated and tasted delicious. I had the pancake of the day which was a buckwheat pancake with red bean and green tea mousse & strawberries. The flavours all came together perfectly and the pancakes were perfectly fluffy & not too heavy. My husband had the shakshuka and it was very well balanced with the perfect spicy and tangy favouring.  THE SPACE- Beautiful space, bright & modern and in an adorable building that is a converted mill. The restaurant is big and I love that they take reservations for brunch! Unionville's main drag is also an adorable place to stroll through after brunch.  THE SERVICE- No issues with the service, our server was friendly & attentive.  I honestly can't think of anything negative to say about this place!"}
{"text":"I had booked dinner for the four of us on a Wednesday at 7:15 p.m.  When I arrived at the restaurant, the restaurant was already in full swing with lots of customers ordering and dining.  Good thing I had called ahead of time to make reservations!  (There was also a private party that night which meant fewer tables than usual.)  We sat at a table in the corner of the open dining room and I had to wait a while before the server remembered to bring me some water for my water glass.  As it was a tapas restaurant, we decided to order a few things to share.  The service was professional but felt a little stand-offish.  Our water glasses were refilled on a frequent basis after our dishes were served.  Unfortunately though, between placing the order for our food and waiting for our food to arrive, it was more than a 30-minute wait.  I was starving and didn't really appreciate the half hour wait for the dinner to arrive.  Our first dish from the 'Nibbles' selection of the menu was the Duck Wings covered with 5 spice salt, kewpie mayo, Japanese bbq sauce, and fried shallots.  This was a highly raved-about dish on Instagram and I had to see what the hype was all about.  The duck wings were indeed very good.  The meat on the bones was tender although a bit chewy in some areas of the bone but the flavours and seasoning were done very well.  The second 'Nibbles' were the Fried Brussels Sprouts with maple balsamic vinaigrette, double smoked bacon (I couldn't taste these though), and served with a side of parmesan aioli (dairy free) for dipping.  Fried brussel sprouts are such a popular item in restaurants these days.  This one was done nicely.  I especially liked the parmesan aioli because it was so cheesy and smooth!  I could have licked up the rest of it.  My friends really favourited this appetizer.  I would say that the Roasted Bone Marrow, another 'Nibbles', was the best and highlight dish for me that night.  It's hard to find good bone marrow and the fact that this was only $12 made it an entire steal!  The roasted bone marrow was so large (with so much marrow inside to scrape out) and in addition to eating coveted bone marrow, there was also Vietnamese beef tartare on top of the marrow itself!  There were also cashews, cilantro, and chilis on top of it.  We ordered two items from the 'Large Plates' menu to share.  The Torched Salmon was prepared and presented so nicely.  The salmon was actually torched in several gradients so that some parts of the flesh were more cooked than others and thus some parts were kept more raw.  This made for such a wonderful texture of the salmon and even reminded me of smooth and soft smoked salmon flesh.  It was served also with some maple soy, puffed wild rice, pickled cucumber, and togarashi aioli.  This was definitely a delicate dish to share and seemed almost like a fine dining dish.  For $15 though, it was worth trying and I loved the taste and texture of the salmon.  Our second 'Large Plates' dish was the Grilled Octopus which included nduja, watercress, potato puree, cashews, and chilis.  Again, this was presented artfully with the potato puree underneath the single tentacle of the octopus.  I was really, really pleasantly surprised with how tender and beautifully and perfectly grilled the octopus was.  Octopus can very easily be over grilled to become a chewy mess, but this one was just perfect.  I'm not even a huge octopus fan but this one was so delicious!  The potato puree was really good too.  All in all, we spent less than $20 each to try a lot of dishes that night although I do have to say that we probably could have split one more dish to really fill our stomachs.  Alas, it was a really good meal and I know why there's a lot of (well deserved) hype about NextDoor Restaurant now!"}
{"text":"The sister restaurant of Smash kitchen does not disappoint! Nestled in Unionville, this restaurant oozes romance.  I had the oysters to start, followed by the fried chicken. My friends had the octopus and the duck entrees, which were smaller portions compared to the chicken dish, but just as delicious."}
{"text":"Food was really really good! Decor and atmosphere was really cozy and pretty. Decent size of the room and seating. The hostess was very accommodating for my husband and I with our daughter. Kinda pricey but it's a nice place for a treat. Conveniently located on main st Unionville. Parking in the back but you have to go to the front to get in."}
{"text":"We reserved a table for ten on a Friday night. It was my first time here but I always hear about it. Because of the wonderful comments I hear about this restaurant, I got my hopes high. Maybe  because I had a higher expectation, I found it only okay. Don't get me wrong, service was great here. Servers were friendly and always came to check up on us. However, I found the food tasted only alright. It did not wow me. As well, in my opinion, the pricing for that portion and quality did not exactly balance. Anyways, I probably will be back since we really enjoyed those fried brussel sprouts. For the first time, the fiancee would reach in to eat a few more."}
{"text":"Overall, I enjoyed dinner at this restaurant.  The server was pleasant and attentive.  For a cocktail, the Caesar was 'dressed to kill' with an amazing looking garnish including 2 kinds of meat, a pepper and lime.  The burger comes with a small salad dripping in dressing and fried potato chips.  Too bad the menu didn't specify any side dishes were included - I had to ask.  The restaurant's biggest flaw is that it's so darn hard to find the entrance.  The door next to the parking lot is marked service and has an arrow which isn't clear.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to go up a set of stairs or around the whole building.  After walking to the other side of the building and passing another door marked service, I finally found the entrance."}
{"text":"Cute place, very instagram-worthy. I got the shakshuka and enjoyed it, although I felt the lamb was a bit gamy. Portions are a bit small but price is $15+. Expect to spend at least $20 per person here. Still, they have very unique menu items and presentation is spot on. It's a good place for brunch."}
{"text":"Walking into this venue on a Friday night feels like  a winery. This is definitely not the ordinary restaurant next door. This is a tapas style restaurant with flavours.  Food  Duck wings, it was a good size and the flavour was good with green onions and chili. Falls off the bone.   Duck pate was a bit on the sweeter side, and the consistency was a bit runny.  Grilled Calamari  It was very tender and tasty. The side came with watercress. You will have a thought bubble, wait I do recall this is tapas but I don't want to share!  Bone marrow with beef tartar  I wasn't a huge fan of the beef tartar but overall not bad. I guess, with the pate and the bone marrow, a little too much bread.  Good ambiance and a nice Friday night dinner place. They will start to serve brunch tomorrow!  Overall a wonderful experience! I will definitely come back and recommend this restaurant to all my friends! I can't wait until the patio is open!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Thursday morning, our order consisted of avocado toast, a poke bowl, and iced coffee. The food was very good, with a great spin on the common avocado toast topped with halloumi cheese and beet hummus, we really enjoyed the iced coffee as well. Unfortunately, the service was pretty mediocre, our server only came to our table when we called him. It also took forever to have our plates cleared away and bills brought to our table."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Sunday. It was pretty busy, but we made a reservation beforehand and were seated right away. I got the poke bowl, which tasted pretty good and I really appreciated that they were very accommodating to my food allergy and replaced the avocado with salmon for no extra charge. I will definitely come back to try the other options on their brunch menu!"}
{"text":"The place to be for fusion/canadian dining uptown, if you enjoy food, prefer a roomy ambiance and don't want to spend an arm and leg for a meal.  The food, where to I start? Duck wings, duck wings, duck wings, A MUST. Actually, scratch that, order anything off the appetizer menu and you can't go wrong. Bone marrow, beef tartare, ahi tuna, brussels sprouts etc all superb.  Mains I would personally just recommend the octopus. Duck breast, not so much as it was soggy, while everything else on the plate tasted better.  The cocktails and mocktails are also on point. (love ginger) Ambience is also on point, roomy so you don't have to worry about other people dropping in on your conversations, and there are two rooms, one with lower and one with higher seating options.  Service is approachable and friendly, without being intrusive.  They also do brunch, but personally I wouldn't. Happy hour sunday-thursday 5-7, 25% off appetizers."}
{"text":"Came here for a long weekend lunch to try this place out. As my friends and I were discussing about the menu for today, cause it is long weekend so we weren't sure if they will serve the lunch menu or the brunch menu (which is only available for the weekend). I made a reservation earlier today online and received an email with my confirmation number. As I arrived at the restaurant, I mentioned I have a reservation. However, they don't have it on record. So much for using technology to make a reservation online if their online booking system doesn't work. Anyhow, I was seated not long after as they had open tables.   One of the staff walked over not long after and started pouring out water into my coup and checked in on us. Then the actual servers came and took our orders. I chose the Turkey BLT and my friend chose the Salmon Salad. This came not long after. Food wise tasted not bad, but not super wowing either. I would of liked my turkey BLT to be warmer. Cause I am not paying for a sandwich that was cold.   The ambiance can be a bit... loud? So having an actual conversation may not work. Another thing I noticed, some staff members' attitude can improve, that I can say for certain. So my experience wasn't wowed. I can say I have had better."}
{"text":"So excited to see Next Door open up in Markham. We no longer have to go to Toronto for such creative dishes!  My husband and I have tried their brunch and dinner and both were great.  For dinner, we tried their fried brussel sprouts, salumi board, lamb sirloin, and spaghetti squash.   The brussel sprouts were incredibly delicious. My husband typically doesn't like brussel sprouts and kept raving about them days later. The salumi board has a good selection of meats and is served with beets and sourdough bread.   The lamb sirloin was really good. The presentation was fantastic. Cooked to a perfect medium rare, we were both really happy with it. The spaghetti squash was delicious as well. It was served with chickpeas, kale, and potato string. Super flavourful and filling, despite being gluten free and vegan.   For dessert, we got a strawberry shortcake. Served in a cute mason jar, this thing was AMAZING. Definitely a perfect ending to an already awesome meal.  We have also tried Next Door's brunch with some friends. We ordered the french toast, shakshuka, okonomiyaki, and cheeseburger. All were incredibly well received and super instagram worthy.  Service is friendly. The manager came to check up on us to make sure we were enjoying ourselves."}
{"text":"I put off writing this update for awhile. NextDoor is the darling of Main Street Unionville, the new kid on the block that's sweeping the popularity contest. So I feel a little weird knocking off a star, especially since I really do enjoy the food and ambiance. I came back recently over the weekend and I think I'm ready now to commit to the downgrade.   Don't get me wrong, the food here is still very tasty. They're bringing millennial toasts to a new level with the addition of a very tasty wild mushroom on toasted brioche. And one of the most delicious items on the menu is the duck. First time I stole some off my boyfriend's plate, I was blown away.   So a few months back, I decided to order the duck myself, having had such fond memories of it. It wasn't a cheap dish, close to $30 with tips and tax. You'd THINK for that kind of money, you're getting the whole breast or something. Nope. As you might see in the picture I uploaded, it was 3 tiny, tiny pieces. Each piece just about equivalent to the size of my tiny, girly finger.   Not happy with that, but I begrudgingly ate it with no complaints. Maybe it was the restaurant's idea of saving money. Or so I thought. Turns out, it wasn't a general ripoff, but a personal one. 30 minutes later, we ran into some friends who happened to be eating at NextDoor as well. One of them ordered the duck. Lo and behold, hers had easily twice the amount of duck.    I held off on my review (partially due to a good brunch we've had there since then and my laziness) until now. Recently came back here for brunch again and made reservations. Service was, for a lack of better word, awkward. Someone from our party was the first to show up and said we had a reservation for 5. \"Oh, they're here already!\" says the hostess and leads her off to not one, but two tables of strangers. No, we weren't already there. Okay, awkward start.   Then, without asking whether or not we were okay with eating outside, started leading her to the patio. It was sweltering that day and we really didn't want that, so my friend awkwardly told her we'd prefer inside. Okay, back inside, the hostess leads my friend to a small, 4-person corner table, again, without asking my friend if this was acceptable. We had 5 people. 2 of them are 6 ft. tall. My friend awkwardly points that out and asks if we can instead have the larger table next to it. \"Oh that's reserved\" says the hostess. Well, we have a reservation too!   Just overall, not the greatest service. They're friendly, yes. But why would you not ask your customer a single question about whether they're okay with things before just assuming that they are? Also a little awkward, there were a few times (yes, more than once) where our server pressed himself up against our table, pointed a camera over our heads, to take a picture of the table on the other side of us. So imagine someone standing in front of you, lifting a camera over your head, to take a picture of the person behind you. I mean, no problem, but again, could at least say, \"sorry, just gonna stand by here to take a pic real quick\".   Having said all that, I still think NextDoor has great food. I'd still go back. The service issues are easily forgivable as I think those can mostly be attributed to an inexperienced staff's learning curve. That duck though. That was not cool.   (46/100) - 2018"}
{"text":"UPDATED   Although I genuinely enjoyed their brunch, I came here again for a friend event and was slightly disappointed. Their service was great and I do have to give it to them for being able to accommodate 35 ish people and kept a smile on their faces. That being said, the food was not as good as I remembered, again may be because of the amount of people being served all at once.  From a prix fixe menu tailored to our liking, I ordered the Brussels Caesar salad, duck breast, and strawberry shortcake.  Brussels Caesar salad - delicious. Brussels sprouts in replacement of your typical romaine lettuce was a fantastic idea. They have the salad a good crunch but wasn't watery like that of lettuce. The Caesar dressing was perfectly balanced with acid and the bacon chunks completed the savoury component.  Duck breast - the duck was slightly gamey, and I believed it was cooked to a point where the meat was tough and hard to chew. The accompaniments of barley and their sauce was great and completed the dish, but the main protein was slightly disappointing.   Strawberry shortcake - This was a miss. Enough sweetness and balance between the cake and the sauce and berries, however the cake itself was really dry, making it not worth what I paid for.  Also tried the torched salmon, which was good but nothing special in particular, and the chocolate mousse/ ganache, which had a strong peanut butter flavour and took away the decadent chocolate that I was craving. The pairing of a raspberry coulis did help balance the dish.   Overall, I'm not sure if the food is worth 4, perhaps just 3.5. I was asked whether I would know what to recommend, and I can't say anything really stood out other than their FRENCH TOAST and MUSHROOM TOAST from brunch."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time for a birthday dinner - was interested to see what dinner was like, since this place is known more as a brunch spot. I like pasta so I ordered the Spaghetti Squash. I guess I should have asked first what it really was, because I thought it was somewhat related to noodles/pasta (it did say it had a soup base & Khao Soi) but when it came it was something completely different. It tasted more like Thai curry/khao soi with fried squash (?) shavings on top. I'm not a big curry fan, although I do like Khao Soi, so that dish was just ok for me I didn't love it (preference thing). I have to admit that as a fusion dish, the mix of the tastes was very intriguing and interesting so I did like that. If you like sour things with a hint of spicy, then this dish is for you. The apps on the other hand are AMAZING.   **Tip: the main door of the restaurant is on the opposite side of the main parking area. We had a bit of trouble locating the door at first lol  Pros: - MUST order the deep fried brussel sprouts - you will not regret it  -the cheese board we ordered was so good - particular the whiskey cheese - i never tasted whiskey cheese before, but damn it felt like you could get drunk off of one bite lol (note: not sure if the cheese selection varies)  - our server Amy was so good - very attentive throughout the whole night, asked us beforehand how we want to split the bill to avoid headaches after, and specifically mentioned that tip was included to avoid us from \"double tipping\" - everyone else's dish looked & tasted really good (i had a bite) - if you want to be on the safe side, order something like steak/lamb/pork -restaurant decor was nice - romantic but with a clean industrial feel - it was my friend's birthday so they asked her to select something from their dessert menu for free - she chose the strawberry basil cake - it was SO good! (we each had a little bite) i love fusion desserts. the blend of tastes was so interesting but really good. the cake itself was soft/spongy but you can taste both strawberry & basil without one overpowering the other. def will save some room for dessert next time.  Cons: - wish they had a little bit more description on the menu to describe some of the less obvious fusion dishes, but i do understand that the guests should ask their server"}
{"text":"Nextdoor was everything that you would expect from a restaurant on Main Street Unionville.  The restaurant has a nice rustic charm to it and the menu consisted of your typical millenial avocado toast and poke bowls.  I particularly enjoyed this place because of the wide vegetarian options, conveniently labelled with a (v).   The poke bowl I ordered was scattered with edamame beans and seaweed salad in addition to the normal fixings you might find in a poke bowl.  It was light and satisfying.  My friend ordered the mushroom grilled cheese, which was also vegetarian, but felt much heavier.  It also came with rosemary fries, so only order it if you are really hungry.   All in all it was a great experience and I would come again."}
{"text":"This place is soo overrated .... food was cold (it wasn't supposed to be) and didn't taste that great, especially considering the price. I've been here a few times, and really tried to give it a chance, but it just isn't that good, and definitely not worth the price. Their sister restaurant, Smash Kitchen, is much better."}
{"text":"Checked out this new restaurant at Main Street Unionville via recommendation from a friend. I got the flat iron steak and my partner got the Louisana chicken. My steak was very chewy but the flavour was definitely there. The chicken was moist and large portion, however could have had more flavour/kick. The breading was not crunchy :(   Aside from the food, the atmosphere (we were on the patio) was very quaint but lots of Mosquitos because it's right by the mill (put on bug spray if you come at night).   Would come back again to try the char siu pancakes and some alcoholic beverages!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed with this place. I feel so scammed by the reviews on Yelp that made me come to this restaurant. I realized that nowadays our society is filled with people who title themselves as \"foodies\" but all they do is take photos of the food and deceiving people with reviews without properly tasting them.   I ordered the duck wings and lamb sirloin. The duck wings were fine but honestly nothing special. The lamb was the most disappointing dish. Not to mention that it was recommended by our waitress as one of their top dishes. The lamb was cold, favor less and unappetizing. My BF had pork and pancakes. The pork literally just takes like cha Chang tang cha siu with green onions on top. If I wanted cha siu, I would not come here for it.   Don't be fooled by the good ratings. I'm sure they're either fake or \"foodies\" attempting to fool you with highly filtered photos.  One last thing I forgot to mention. There was a chinese guy wearing glasses who literally ruined my mood by just looking at his face. He looks so unhappy and unimpressed with his job even though he looks like he's in management position. He scolded our waitress and gave her the dirtiest look regardless of customers being around. Overall, super unprofessional and rude. By just looking at his black face turned my mood negative. He should be spoken to about his customer service skills. Completely unacceptable and classless."}
{"text":"Don't make the same mistake I did by walking all around the building-It's on the left side of the building. This resto has a unique menu that includes; meats, seafood, dairy and even Vegan options!   I went for happy hour 3:00pm-6:00pm (Sun- Thurs) see pic for more details. It wasn't as particularly busy as the reviews have warned, probably because it was a weekday or perhaps before dinner hours?  It's a nice cozy place, I didn't really explore the place but I think it has two rooms, one for bar/lounge and the other for dining.   The service was excellent. Our server was very knowledgeable and helpful with explaining the menu and offering suggestions.   Ordered oysters, bread, bone marrow, Brussels sprouts, duck wings, chicken and ribs.  oysters (French kiss and kushi) was fresh. bone marrow taste was over powered by the Vietnamese tartar which we weren't a fan of. First time trying Vietnamese tartar style, it was interesting but I don't fancy it. the chicken entree was crispy and juicy. ribs were tender and juicy. Brussels sprouts were crispy and sauce was yummy. Duck wings were crispy and flavorful but it was more like drum sticks. The winning item was bread and butter (surprise!) the bread was warm and the butter was a crowd pleaser. It was sweet, almost like caramel in butter form.  I would recommend to others. great for dates and get togethers (lots of big tables)"}
{"text":"First time at next door... the moment we went inside it was an automatic 5 star. Customer service was excellent, we felt welcomed by every worker. I'm surprised it was quite empty, this restaurant definitely  needs more attention. the dinner menu was quite simple with only a few items. We got duck wings to start. Pork with pancakes and fried chicken as the main. The presentation was fine dining worthy, it was colourful , clean and Instagram worthy! The meat on our dishes was super juicy and melts. Definitely will bring more people with us and recommend  to everybody."}
{"text":"Very creative menu! I really enjoyed the okonomiyaki, it's a fun take on savoury pancakes! The avocado toast was also done really well. Both were topped with poached eggs, so that made it extra delicious. The environment of the space is very relaxing and casual, but also trendy. The service was also excellent."}
{"text":"Came here for my aunt's milestone birthday.  We had a big group. And the service was great.  From the server right up to the manager.  I had the lamb and I thought it was delicious. Brussels sprouts was also amazing.  Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is not bad, however is it just not too satisfying. I could say this place is the best restaurant on main street. I want to tell my viewers more about this restaurant but there's not much to say. Their style of the food is not too unique and not too basic. PSA: this place is very hidden so make sure you are looking with all your eyes!"}
{"text":"4.5 new fave spot in Markham! I believe this is the first week of opening, very clean and the staff were amazing. This place is more of a sharing style restaurant. I loved the Brussel sprouts with parmesan aioli sauce and the duck wings. Never would I say Brussel sprouts tasted so good. Both are a must have. I wanted to try the bone marrow  however it was not offered today. I also tried the mushroom gyzo which decent as well. I tried the torch salmon and hot fried chicken which was ok. Lastly we tried the maple glazed donut which was so good, the cookie crumble complemented the dish very well. I will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday for brunch and it's a neat little placed tucked in main St unionville. Decor is modern and stuff is friendly and hip!  I had the salmon poke bowl which is A+++ will definitely have again! Also tried the avocado sandwich and that was good too. The burger was ok but overall would definitely come again!  Overall - 5   Food - 5 salmon poke bowl + avocado sandwich  Kid friendly - 5 yes I would say so. there are regular tables on the left side and a bar feel on the right side  Staff - 5 friendly and fast  Parking - 3 parking is limited but there's a free lot around the corner a few minutes from the restaurant"}
{"text":"Consistently happy with the food & service here. The brussel sprouts, duck wings and torched salmon are stand-outs! Great choice for dinner or just a light snack/drinks. Would definitely recommend you try this place out!"}
{"text":"Brunch on the patio was lovely! Great service and fantastic food! Unusual selection of menu items, each plate was an artistic masterpiece, worthy of discussion by everyone else. Refills of beverages could be improved though."}
{"text":"Trying Next Door for the first time, I felt that they had a unique experience with a variety of good food options. This is a great option for people who are looking into different options - brunch, lunch, dinner and late night drinks.   Next Door has unique hip decorations when you enter giving the vybe of a neighbourhood bar for yuppies, but it also feels classy when you move further away from the front entrance. Although parking is on one side of the building, you will have to walk over to the other side in order to enter the restaurant, but this also gives you the opportunity to walk around this pretty structure in Mainstreet Markham.  Their dinner menu is for 3pm to 10pm. Note: there is no free bread included in this meal, which is a little uncommon for Western restaurants. However, if you would like to have some bread, you can order it for $5.   I tried the Tortellini ($14). The description, \"Curried sweet potato dumpling / hen of the woods mushrooms / sun dried cherry tomatoes tempura green beans / spinach puree\", was extremely accurate. The presentation was amazing! The tortellini was surrounded by the tempura green beans - very delicious and large plump cherry tomatoes. However, this is a rather small dish, there are less than 10 pieces of two-bite sized tortellini. The sauce was DELICIOUS. I don't know how they made the spinach puree, but it honestly was a magnificent sauce to the dish.  I also tried their NextDoor Burger ($18). The description, \"6oz / smoked mozzarella / bacon  caramelized onions / arugula / kewpie mayo / brioche bun\" already makes you know how delicious this dish is before biting into it. This wasn't a regular burger, the chef and cooks really took the time to make all the components of the burger and compiled it to create a delicious meal. The caramelized onions really added onto the taste of the NextDoor Burger, and none of the caramelized onions were burnt! This may also be one of the largest mains, so definitely get it for the worth of it's price!  All in all, I do wish Next Door served bread - not the kind with butter, but the ones with olive oil. Please, just do it. Other than that, this was a delicious meal - I can't wait to try their brunch!"}
{"text":"Portions are a bit small but still is a great place for some light lunch. Food was great. And trust me and get the Brussels sprouts, they are the best you'll have for a vegetable called Brussels sprouts"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dinner here. Only recently opened but food and service was excellent. Will be back.   We started with raspberry point oysters that were perfect. Then moved on to spaghetti squash curry dish. Mildly spicy and a lovely vegan option. Then we shared this octopus which was super tender. Finally we had the torched tuna which was fabulous. Lively combo of puffed rice and cucumber!  Drink selection was small but perfect for our food - bubbles and a dry rose. Finished with a digestive and their banana bread. Desert was more like a light bread pudding if that's possible. Not overly sweet and served with a great tea creme anglais.  Casual and comfortable atmosphere. Very friendly and knowledgable staff. Happy to have this in the neighbourhood. Like I said - we'll be back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!! The service was spectacular our server was super friendly and polite which makes such a difference to our dinning experience:) everyone had a smile on their face, we felt welcomed and enjoyed our time there lots. Food was just the right portion for both adults and kids. The pork was tender, torched salmon was just right! My son that never finishes anything when we go out to eat ate the whole bowl of pasta! We bought our own cake to a birthday celebration and the waitress even offered to cut the whole cake for us! We will be back for sure to try the other dishes"}
{"text":"This was my second time here, as I came June 2017 when they opened not too long ago.  I called to make a reservation for my friend's birthday, and they were really thorough with their questions.  Asking whether we had any food allergies, and asking what the occasion was for.  I was really surprised when they said because it was for a birthday, they have a birthday dessert on the house, and if you want to bring your own cake, then there will be a cake charge.  When I got there, I was greeted by a very nice hostess, who acknowledged that it was my friend's birthday, and asked if I wanted to pick, or just have a surprise.  I picked a surprise.  The dining room was very nice and romantic.  Dimmed lights, candles, soft music, rustic feel.  The server was very polite and nice!  Gave us some suggestions and recommendations.  We decided to try the duck pate, brussel sprouts and lamb shank.  She said the duck pate was newly vamped with presentation.  It was very nicely presented, the duck pate was not too salty and complemented well with all the crackers that it came with.  The Brussel Sprouts were nicely glazed with a sweetness to offset the bitterness, and the creamy sauce it came with was so good! it was garlicky, and so yummmms!  The lamb shank was a pretty good size for sharing between my friend and I.  It was nicely cooked at medium rare as requested.  Nice and tender, complemented well with the sides.  After dinner, we were offered the dessert menu, then soon after the waitress came with a strawberry cake with a sparkler for my friend.  She was indeed very surprised and happy.  The cake was very moist, the strawberries were not too tart.    They made it a goal to put service priority at this restaurant, and it's very rare to see that now a days.  The servers always came by to refill our water, and never pressured us to leave after dinner.  Wonderful experience, and such a nice outing!!  When i came in June, the place was packed, and we were only able to sit at the bar, so definitely make a reservation, as it does get busy, and parking gets limited in the summer!"}
{"text":"Went there today for lunch at around 11am when they first opened. Had gone there because I had seen the brunch menu and it had looked interesting. Hadn't seen the lunch menu and maybe should have looked at it beforehand because it was pretty typical with mostly sandwiches/burger options but I decided to stay and give it a try since I really like smash and I know this is their sister restaurant. So here's how I'd break down the overall experience: 1/ service - I expected better at this type of restaurant  It was my husband and I with our baby in a car seat. The hostess asked us how many, looked at us and said, \"oh two\". I corrected her and said it was two adults and a baby. Most restaurants would count the baby regardless of whether or not they were eating. Then we were led to a two person table with two chairs. I stood there for a second because I wasn't going to put my baby on the floor and the hostess finally clued in and asked if we needed a chair for the car seat. The service for the rest of the meal from our waitress was fine but the interaction with the hostess really soured the experience as I didn't feel very welcomed with a baby. 2/ food - average we had the nextdoor burger with a butternut squash soup and the mushroom grilled cheese. The burger was good but at the $16 price point I wouldn't necessarily come back for it. The soup was too sweet. The mushroom grilled cheese I didn't enjoy too much, the sundried tomato was the predominant flavour where I was expecting to actually taste more mushroom but it wasn't terrible.  Overall I don't think we will be back in the very least for lunch as the prices were high, food average and the service doesn't seem very family friendly."}
{"text":"Great food, atmosphere and staff. The price is reasonable for the location. We came on the weekend and it wasn't too packed so we didn't need to wait to be seated. Oysters were fresh. highly recommended, will definitely return"}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot but today I was disappointed with the food quality and visual appearance of the food."}
{"text":"Went there for Sunday brunch. The food is not bad. We had avocado toast and the burger.   We also really enjoy the environment cozy and relax.   Good place for couples and family gathering.   But make sure you make the reservation before you go. Otherwise you probably need to wait in line."}
{"text":"Upon entering the restaurant you are greeted by this beautiful interior space, spacious, bright, modern. The fact that they don't have couch seats is already a plus, in fact, their seats were sleek and elegant yet super comfy. Big windows that allow light in are an Food Instagramers dream, as well as fast free Wi-fi.  As you are brought to your seat, you are welcomed by a server that lists off todays specials. As for myself, I ended up ordering the Blood Orange Juice special and the Nutella Strawberry pancakes. I'd have to say the Nutella Strawberry pancakes were super fluffy and super delicious. Would totally recommend ordering if its on the menu again.  I also ended up ordering the Next door burger and the Fish and chips. Both were good, yet had some downfalls here and there. The fish and chips batter is light, airy and crisp. However it was accompanied with a not-needed curry mayonnaise, it was just odd and out of place. The burger was very flavourful, with the fat and crispiness coming from the bacon; smokiness from the smoked mozzarella; creaminess from the kewpie mayo and to cut it the fresh arugula. Despite all that, the burger was a tad too dry due to it being cooked well done, instead of a nice mid rare. Added to both dishes were rosemary potato wedges, which at first were pretty tasty but then they got boring which I speculate is because they coat it with some kind of flour which makes it too starchy.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to any of my friends or even take a first date here. Hope to try other things on the menu in the future"}
{"text":"The owners behind Smash Kitchen have opened up an awesome new restaurant at the Planing Mill on Main Street Unionville. I've been hearing quite a bit about this restaurant from my cousin (who is a chef at Smash), and thus was excited about attending Next Door's grand opening.   The decor can be described as rustic elegance (and a vast improvement over the decor of the previous two restaurants that occupied the space). The concept is Asian inspired Canadian fare, served in a shareable plates format (tapas if you will). The menu has some unique offerings for this area, including roasted bone marrow, fried Brussels sprouts, & BBQ ox tongue.   Dining solo, I opted for the fried Brussels sprouts ($8) and mushroom gyoza ($12.50). However I was later regretting not ordering more, so I added an order of the duck wings ($10), a mocktail ($5), and the complimentary dessert.  The duck wings, served with Japanese BBQ sauce and fried scallions, were crispy and delicious. The Kewpie mayo drizzle on duck wings added a bit of creaminess to this already rich dish.    The fried Brussels sprouts were delicious with the maple balsamic glaze and bits of fried pork. I'm not sure it added anything to have the Kewpie mayo served as a condiment to the fried Brussels sprouts.  The mushroom gyoza had a rich mushroom flavour, and the presence of the edamame and meaty oyster mushrooms helped make this a more substantial vegan-friendly dish. To wash down my meal, I ordered the Dark and Stormy, which was a refreshing gingery mocktail which helped cut some of the richness of some of my food selections.  As part of a Grand Opening special, I received a complimentary dessert: kahlua maple glazed donuts with dark chocolate cookie crumbs! The donut was fresh, its flavour was sweet (but not too sweet), and I enjoyed the texture and slight bitterness that the dark chocolate cookie crumbs added to this dish.  I am beyond excited to have a great restaurant like Next Door open up shop in the neighbourhood. I will definitely be back to try more of the delicious sounding dishes!"}
{"text":"Found out about this place via a yelp elite event where we ate brunch foods for dinner.  The staff were all very professional and proactive. There weren't a ton of people when we went on a Saturday at noon. Good thing the brunch menu wasn't put away yet!  I wasn't too hungry at the time so I got the cereal bowl. It had strawberries, raisins, almonds, blueberries, and granola with almond milk on the side. The combo together was amazing!  Dude had the okonomiyaki pancake which I recommended and it was superb. It had bacon and two poached eggs on the pancakes!  Def would come back again. Food came out hot and interior was clean and roomy!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always come here for the after 9pm specials (Sunday to Thursdays) It's 25% off all nibbles and there's a few specials on drinks too. Not sure how long this will be around for so definitely go check it out. Here are a few of our favourites dishes:  Roasted Bone Marrow ($14) Delicious and has a nice kick to it with the chilies and lime. Make sure to eat it while its hot!  Duck Wings ($11) My boyfriend loves these. It's sometimes a hit or miss with this one depend on how meaty the wings are that day.  Pan Seared Duck ($25) This was my favourite main on the menu. It has a good balance of sweet, salty, acidity and richness from all the ingredients on the dish.  Torched Sashimi Salmon ($16) Dish was a little on the richer side for me especially with the sauce. We also ordered quite a bit of food so I was already almost full.  Service is very quick and the waiters/waitresses are always friendly. At the time we usually go at, there is no wait. You'll get a choice between the dining room or the lounge/bar area.  If they come out with any new dishes, I would definitely love to try it out. I'm getting slightly bored with the current menu (minus the duck wings and bone marrow)."}
{"text":"NextDoor has everything you'd want in a restaurant: an innovative menu, a gorgeous interior, and some great service. In my limited experience here, while I did enjoy my experience, some of the items were hit or miss.   We went with two items for our dinner: the torched salmon and the spaghetti squash. The quality was there, you can definitely taste the ingredients. The salmon looked incredible but there was some balance issues. The dish was simply too salty and there was too much togarishi aoili as well. I expected more rice for the base to compliment and neutralize the creaminess and saltiness. However, full marks for the greens, the nori flakes, and the super healthy amount of salmon sashimi there!  The spaghetti squash was a nice and light dish but lacked some depth. I personally loved the sweetness of squash and the nuttiness of the chickpeas, but something was missing here. I didn't think there was a strong enough salty component to counteract that sweetness. The texture was also underwhelming, being on the soft side with only a light crunch from the strings.  All in all, my dinner was at Nextdoor was fairly enjoyable. I liked their fusion takes and like what they're doing here. The creativity is there. Service was exceptional and we were taken care of well! I'd love to be back to try their other dinner plates or for the brunch here."}
{"text":"Great food and service! We had the salumi board, duck, the beet pasta and finished by ordering practically all the desserts lol so worth it.  Food was well presented, well seasoned and portions were decent.  Service was also attentive.   One thing I took a star away for was how freaking cold it was to sit by the windows. We went on a cold night but it was super drafty. We spent dessert in our jackets and wrapped up in scarves.   Definitely will be back but maybe in warmer weather lol"}
{"text":"NextDoor was on my list ever since it opened last year, but I never got the chance to try it. My friend and I finally dropped by for brunch this Saturday morning. Thankfully, we reserved a seat as it was packed around noon. The brunch menu had your usual items like The Safe Side (eggs, bacon, and grilled sourdough), as well as some unique ones like the Okonomiyaki pancakes. I was on the fence about the Okonomiyaki pancakes but decided to yolo it in the end. My friend had the avocado toast.   Okonomiyaki pancakes- this was a Japanese twist on Western pancakes. It came w/ 3 pancakes that were topped w/ 2 poached eggs, bacon, nori, bonito flakes, and a Japanese mayo bbq sauce. The pancakes had the right thickness and were dense enough w/o being too tough or dry. I particularly liked how they infused seaweed in the batter as the savory-ness paired well w/ the bacon & eggs. The eggs were perfectly poached as well, and the entire dish was tied together by the sauce. I was pleasantly surprised that this pairing worked out so well.   Avocado toast- this had two thick slices of sourdough topped w/ 2 poached eggs, beet hummus, roasted almonds, and avocado mash. On the side was a piece of grilled halloumi cheese. The hummus & avocado mash were fresh, and the smooth creamy texture contrasted well against the toasted sourdough. The poached eggs were perfectly runny as well, and the halloumi cheese, which reminded me of thick feta, elevated the dish.   In terms of design, I love the modern rustic look of NextDoor, as well as the spacious seats and big windows to let in natural sunlight. Service was good."}
{"text":"This restaurant was very good. My mom had her birthday here and she had the lamb legs. They are so juicy and tender! My dad had the beef short ribs for dinner. It is so tender you don't ever have to chew it hard. The pasta is nice and satisfying, and there is a good amount on the plate. The staff were very nice to us, and the decorations are a good mix between home and bar. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is definitely overrated and overhyped,  especially by the millennial, East-Asian demographic that populate the surrounding city of Markham.  Food: 2.5 (out of 5) Service: 0 Setting: 2 Overall: 1.5   SERVICE: Let's start with the main reason why this place left such a disappointing and bad taste in our mouths: BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE.   It honestly does not matter to me if the food tastes heavenly and is at a Michelin-star level (which it did not, in this case), if a restaurant cannot even get the basics of customer service right. I mean, when you dine out at a restaurant, you are not simply there to enjoy the food; it is an entire package that you are paying for. They don't call it the hospitality industry for nothing.  Upon arrival, I was greeted by three different hosts at the same time, and felt a bit ambushed as all three were talking to me at the same time. I arrived at 7:05pm for our reservation at 7:00pm. I found my friend who was already sitting and waiting by the front, and joined her, but neither of us were told how much longer the wait would be, as if they were happily complacent to get us off their chests, without having to deliver a table in the moment that we greeted each other. The various hosts proceeded to assist others who had shown up after us, and brought them to their tables, without any communication or response as to why we were not seated yet in a dining room full of empty tables. By now, it was 7:15. We were finally seated around 7:30 by the male host in glasses, which would have made sense if they had apologized for the long wait time or some kind of valid explanation, but again, nothing was communicated.  We ordered two appetizers, and two mains to share amongst us: Bone Marrow, Fried Brussel Sprouts, Lamb Sirloin, and Torched Salmon.  Throughout the meal, even when there was food left on the plate, we were constantly greeted by different waitresses who wanted to clear our plates, and kept asking if we were done, or still working on them. This is one of my biggest pet peeves, when dining out. If the food still has food on it, stop coming around every 2 minutes, asking if we're done. We are clearly not done. By the fourth time, we had to stop and take a look behind us to see if there was a lineup out the door (there was no one waiting), as we felt we were being rushed and kicked out.  Finally, the worst part of the meal was at the end when we were all paying for our bills separately. Our waitress, Joyce, left us, quite unprofessionally, mid-service to deal with another table, so I helped my friend click on the same amount on the machine, so we could speed up the process, as our waitress was still not back, to assist. We all had our receipts confirming payment sitting on the table, when she finally came back to take the machines away, along with the four merchant copies of receipts.  Two minutes later, she came back all stern and accusatory-looking, and said, \"I believe one of you didn't pay. I'm missing one of your payments.\" We were shocked that she said that, when all of us clearly paid, and showed her our receipts one by one. And she literally went through our credit card numbers and invoice numbers one by one, out loud, in an accusatory tone. This was hilarious to me, because one of our friends was asked if she wanted a copy of the receipt and she said, \"No,\" but now we were questioned on why we didn't have them all. I felt like we were being interrogated in a police station, rather than sitting in a supposedly nice restaurant in the middle of Main Street, Unionville. Joyce went away to further investigate, and came back realizing her mistake. However, rather than starting with \"Sorry,\" we were reprimanded for trying to help her out by continuing the payment process. Isn't the number one rule of customer service is that 'the customer is always right,' especially in the sense that you should definitely NOT be blaming the customer for your own mistake?   FOOD: In terms of the food, we all agreed it was decent, edible, but not amazing or as extraordinary as social media had depicted, which was the most disappointing part, especially when our waitress, Joyce, upsold and claimed the particular menu items we ordered were \"...the most popular and so good, as you can probably see all over Instagram.\"   The Lamb Sirloin (CAD$24) was a perfect example of this 'Expectation vs. Reality' disappointment. The restaurant's own IG handle posted a delicious-looking full-sized plate of lamb sirloin pieces with cauliflower, sundried tomato, almonds, hummus, fresh basil, arugula and pomegranate.  Clearly, our much smaller dish looked quite different, with: very FEW pieces of burnt-tasting cold BBQ lamb, cherry tomato halves instead of sundried tomato, no almonds, no basil, and no pomegranate. We pretty much got half of what the menu listed, and the plate looked like half the version of what they show on Instagram.   Overall, service was terrible and food was overhyped and disappointing."}
{"text":"i keep hearing good feedback from friends, finally have chance to go, they take reservation, better so it before u go especially during weekend.   we order the brunch menu which re oknomiyaki (japanese style pancake) and avocado toaste. and the drinks we got strawberry & guava, dark & stormy mock-tail. the food served fast, tasty, nice dining environment and service, all in all, we will come back next time!"}
{"text":"Meant to come here some months ago, NextDoor is a relatively new additional to Main St Unionville. This place focuses on local ingredients with a twist among some food favorites. The venue is beautiful, clean cut, contemporary and if you're here in the summer they've got an outdoor patio overlooking the main street.   In terms of food here's the breakdown: Apps:  **Fried Brussels sprouts drizzled with a sweet sauce, definitely worth another order if you love this dish. **Bone marrow served with tostadas, great presentation and worth every bite.    Mains: **Next door burger, in house made served with giant rosemary potato wedges, decadent all-round! **She had the Squash spaghetti served on a bed of sweet yet tangy curry, interesting which was appealing to me.   Overall this was a lovely experience, the venue, ambiance and service was excellent."}
{"text":"We had brunch there, service was good. The food was definitely delicious and unique.  The portions were larger than expected. But I'm not complaining."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and I really like it! I've only ever been for lunch during the summer, so we ate outside on the patio both times. I grew up in Unionville, so I have seen this particular restaurant location change many times over the years. I am glad it is now a restaurant with an interesting and experimental menu. I love their fried brussels sprouts, their shaved brussels sprouts caesar salad, and their assorted pickled vegetables (we had pickled rhubarb which I thought was so lovely and bright and juicy). Their kimchi is excellent. The only thing I have to say is that I find it strange that they charge for bread and don't offer fries on the menu. If I could offer any advice to the owner, I would say switch those around! Offer complimentary bread and do a side of fries option that you can charge for! It just makes more sense.   We have reservations here tonight for my sister's birthday- so I will update on the dinner menu after!"}
{"text":"Brought my friend here for her birthday brunch and it was surprisingly good food, service and ambience...   I made reservations for 1pm on a Saturday the restaurant was semi-full.. Word of mouth goes strong as they have only been opened for a month...  We ended up ordering Okonomiyako,  ND Poke and the avocado toast.. All were delish....  The okonomiyaki was quite unique, made as a pancake topped with okonomiyaki toppings and sauce.. Additional poached eggs were on top as an extra touch... Went well together..   ND Poke,  was quite delish as there were quite some salmon as well as the avocado and edmame beans. Everything was on par... Well worth!   Avocado Toast has a slice of pan fried cheese, avocado and poached eggs...our eggs were well done instead... When I asked our server, it was taken care of instantaneously...got a new dish within mins.. This is what I call amazing service....  All in all,  a place I will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service! I had lunch with a friend today (we were planning to go for brunch but they only serve brunch on weekends for now) and ordered the Malpeque oysters, fried Brussels sprouts, the ND Poke bowl, and the Pappardelle with watercress pesto. Service is quick and the servers are very attentive!"}
{"text":"4.5/5 rating! Service: Very attentive. The server asked us what the restaurant can improve on in terms of the dishes we ordered. The guys are pretty good looking too.  Food: Asian fusion great for the Markham area residents! The salmon is a must try. Their dessert menu is too standard (but there's plenty of dessert places nearby Main St. Unionville). Thai Chilli Crab was \"out of stock\" by the time we got there at 7:30pm.  Will definitely be coming back to try the crab. Noise level was a bit too loud due a larger crowd seated next to my table."}
{"text":"NextDoor is the sister restaurant of Smash Kitchen & Bar so when I heard about this new place, I was so excited to try it out!   We came by around 10:30 in the morning on Saturday and was given a choice of sitting out in the patio or indoor. Despite the nice weather, we opted to sit inside because it got a bit chilly and my friend was in shorts (Can't blame him though the weather was deceiving!)  I ordered the ND Poke and it was surprisingly good! The poke bowl was served with a bed of rice and came with a generous amount of cubed salmon which was well marinated, nori (Japanese seaweed), a handful of edamame, avocado and was sprinkled with a pinch of tobiko!   To be honest, I've had better poke bowls out in the west coast but for $15 the quality of what NextDoor offered was very good value! I would definitely come back to check out the patio view and their dinner menu (Heard that the Roasted Bone Marrow is a crowd pleaser!)."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. I had no expectations as I had no idea what cuisine we were having that night. We were a group of 12 and service was good - we all received our orders with no hassle and the server even brought out a cake for my friend after our dinner.  Most of my friends enjoyed their food, based on their comments. Everything was very fusion style - western cuts of meats with Asian inspired flavours.  To be honest, none of the descriptions for the mains really attracted me too much so I settled for the torched salmon sashimi, and had the bone marrow as an appetizer.   The bone marrow was quite good - usually when it's served on its own it tends to get a bit nauseating after a while with that fat content. The seasoned tartare went really well with it. The baguette that came with it was fresh however some of the edges were a bit too well done that I had to cut the burnt parts off.   The salmon I think is more of an appetizer than a main - it tastes good but I wasn't feeling completely satiated after my meal. I think it could have been either torched a bit longer to match better with the crispy brown rice or paired with a rice and greens to go more along the poke route. I just think that this dish was lacking some kind of carb, nut, avocado, or something that would make me feel like I don't have to order another dish.   I also had the Ramos gin fizz drink - it has a good flavour but a bit too creamy for me. Also got warm really quick because it doesn't have ice, and I like my cocktails cold.   I would probably come back and try something else because I did like the ambiance of the place."}
{"text":"Probably one of the most modern looking brunch places I've been to in Markham. Love the atmosphere and the decor. The service is impeccable. I walk in through the door and am quickly acknowledged by 2 to 3 hostess / hosts and or even the manager.   Seating is quick! I like sitting at the bar side because of the brightness of the room as well as there are less people, which means it's less loud and a lot more roomy feeling.   When I first came, I got the bone marrow and khao soi with butternut squash and the ahi tuna. All of which were really great!!   Don't quite remember all the details to the dish but you can definitely see the pictures.   Today we walked in with the same feeling of being welcomed and seated right away. We ordered the avocado toast and the okonomiyaki.   If you want to know price ranges. Brunch on a weekend is around $9-18. Not bad at all for a brunch place uptown.   I definitely recommend this place to those who want a modern fusion of brunch foods.  The head chef here is Isaac Co. Great job on the creativity!!"}
{"text":"More and more asian fusion restaurants are opening in Markham. I was excited to try NextDoor and see how it compares to other restaurants offering asian fusion.   I came on a weeknight, the restaurant was extremely empty. My group was one of the two tables in the dining area.   Service: the service was quick. Food came out quickly and our server was attentive.   Food:  Roasted Bone Marrow- This was a bone marrow item topped with beef tartare. I was really disappointed in this item. I was hoping to have a bone marrow dish with beef tartare as a topping, but all I could taste was the beef tartare. I couldn't even see any bone marrow. The beef tartare was also just an okay.   Fried Brussel Sprouts- I love brussel sprouts so I had to get this. The dish was way too sweet with the maple balsamic vinaigrette. I like how they are trying to be different, and the flavor was nice. However, I found it wayyy too sweet.   Duck Wings- This was probably the best item I had. The duck wings were crispy and the sauce was flavorful.   Roasted Lamb Leg- This dish came out quite cold. Since the lamb pieces are placed on the tzatziki, this may have cooled the meat before it is served to customers. This dish had vegetables on hummus and the lamb is on the tzatziki. I did not like this dish at all. The lamb was very bland and everything didn't go well together.  Overall I did not have a good experience at NextDoor. The food was mediocre. Food came out cold and I didn't find the flavors in each dish went well together. Also the bone marrow barely had any bone marrow. I had high hopes but I left with disappointment."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch. I liked the Large cappuccino cups with the biscotti  and creative sounding dishes like the okinomiyaki,  it tasted good. We also had the shakshuka but I didn't like how the lamb was Gamey. We sat on the high chairs on the patio when the weather was warm, the high chairs overlook the river being next to it gave you a certain vibe. Will go again"}
{"text":"Must try the Brussels sprouts, ox tongue, duck wings, bone marrow, lamb, salmon, octopus and end with the strawberry shortcake dessert!  They also have unique and amazing wines! Lovely spot on Unionville Main Street, can't wait till the patio opens!"}
{"text":"I bookmarked this restaurant hoping to try its brunch but ended up coming on a weekday afternoon. We were greeted with enthusiasm by both the hostess and the server. There were two dining halls plus the outdoor patio. It got busier as our lunch progressed. Despite the wide open dining space, I didn't feel like I had to talk over other tables. Great ambience and comfy seating! We ordered the fried brussels sprouts, turkey BLT, and pork banh mi sandwich. Brussels sprouts were done nicely, the aioli helped cut down the tangy sweetness from the maple syrup.  I tried a quarter of my friend's turkey BLT, a bit disappointed it wasn't actual turkey meat. It's definitely better quality than the turkey meat you can buy from deli counter.  My pork banh mi arrived looking like a burger. Turns out it's potato bun. Couldn't taste any of the duck liver mousse. The pork has just enough fattiness to it that you can taste it but that also meant some of the grease got soaked by the bun. I couldn't eat the bun halfway through the sandwich.  I liked having a bit of salad and kettle chips. In case you're wondering, the kettle chips are not homemade. The service and atmosphere won me over more so than the food. With that said, I am still curious to come back to try their brunch offerings!"}
{"text":"We decided to go here for date night in Unionville and were pleasantly surprised by the delicious food. What really was the star of the night was the brussel sprouts. Absolutely done to perfection. Service was great. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"1/2/2018 NextDoor is the sister restaurant to Smash Kitchen (great place) and I went with a few friends for the first time. It is a place full of aesthetics and feels very classy. They have a limited but unique menu. The ambiance and service provided by our waitress was great.  We started off with a cheese board to share. They allow for unlimited refills on bread and crackers. We shared between five people but the portion of the cheese and sides are probably for two to three. It was still very enjoyable with the Sauvignon Blanc we paired it with.  We also ordered:  - Torched Salmon Sashimi - $16.00: presentation of this dish was great. It was torched longer than I thought it would be but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The rice was pleasantly crispy and the greens were a flavorful addition. The portion for this is dish was quite small.  - Spaghetti Squash - $15.00: presentation was beautiful with the crispy potato strings. The curry flavor was a bit too spicy for some of my friends but I personally found the level just right. Something did seem missing in terms of components to elevate the dish. Although the curry sauce was savory, the sweetness of the squash overpowered it and there wasn't sauce enough to balance the overall flavor.  - Beet Spaghetti - $14.00: roasted beet and chili sauce, ricotta, red cabbage and chives. The presentation of this dish in comparison to the ones mentioned above was underwhelming but I felt like this was the best tasting dish.  - Tortellini- $14.00: curried sweet potato dumpling with wood mushrooms, tomatos, tempura green beans and spinach puree. The presentation was amazing. The tempura green beans were the star of this dish- cooked perfectly and very crispy. The tortellini was underwhelming in terms of taste (lack of flavor) and presentation alone. The portion was also pretty small and probably about 8 pieces of dumplings. The spinach puree was good but I felt like it was a bit too much.   [3.5] Overall, I had an enjoyable experience and I would come back to try their brunch menu which I've heard many good things about. They have a variety of unique items of high quality although with smaller portions."}
{"text":"I saw many posts on instagram of NextDoor's food and decided to come here on a weekday to try their brunch menu... to find out they don't offer brunch menu during weekdays :*( So tidbit for everyone, come on the weekend if you want to try their brunch!!!  **UPDATE: They serve brunch on weekdays now! :D  We were only able to choose from the lunch menu so I decided on something that's closest to \"breakfast\" foods.   * MUSHROOM GRILLED CHEESE (4/5) (Truffle mushroom duxelle / roasted mushrooms / mozzarella / sundried cherry tomatoes / arugula)  This was yummy!! I really liked the sauce that was cooked with the mushrooms. The salad on the side was also very light and delicious. I'd recommend sharing this sandwich with another person because portions were kind of big.   Service was excellent. I'd come back to try more items on the menu :)"}
{"text":"This was my restaurant choice for our anniversary dinner and they were really kind to squeeze our reservation in. I called literally at the last minute (when you're an adult and life gets in the way amiright?). Gotta say the staff are top notch amazing and super friendly people!  & the food, graciously matches that standard :)  There's nothing I love more than a restaurant that's sorta got the rustic vibes and a proudly creative menu. The apps all look sooo good that we're just going to have to come back and try them all. But for this night, we started with the balsamic glaze brussel sprouts and the duck wings. These seemed to be the most popular choices by our fellow Yelpers as well! The duck had strong flavours and was delicious. But those brussel sprouts? OUT OF THIS WORLD amazing! They had the natural sweet vegetable taste topped with the balsamic glaze for a more tarte, appetizing punch. And who could forget the pancetta bits that added a rustic flavour to it all? This dish comes with a garlic Parmesan aioli which I felt complimented the brussel sprouts perfectly. Yes, I could go on about this, but you should really just go try it.  For mains, he got the burger (of course) and I got the duck (yes.. more duck!). The burger was great, and it came with rosemary wedges. The wedges had been friend so really they were more like thick fries. My only criticism of the night would be please consider baking these with the rosemary instead for a better flavour. The duck came over a bed of mushroom & puffed rice. The duck was beautifully cooked and had a very rich flavour, but that puffed rice!! I am loving all the weirdest things this meal aren't I... Every bite of that rice was like an explosion of mushroom flavour. It was so early and savoury. I couldn't ask for better to go with the meal.   They were the sweetest staff, honestly! For our anniversary, they brought out a little slice of cake with a sparkler. There were berries over the cake and the cake itself had a pound cake texture. I really wish I could recall what it was! It was floral and just a hint of sweetness. Perfect way to end the meal.  Price wise, all this was about $30-40 per person. Honestly, 100% worth it and at a fantastic price. Gorgeous location right on Main Street, with beautifully rustic/contemporary decor. I hope to be back soon to try their brunch!"}
{"text":"Been here twice - once for dinner and once for brunch. All dishes came in with surprises and made me want to try more.   My recent visit was for brunch an I love the avocado toast. The okonomiyaki pancakes also tasted great. Wanted to try the French toast but were too full at the end. Maybe save it for next time!"}
{"text":"Tried the brunch and everything was so pretty (and delicious too!) I love the atmosphere - has a rustic, upscale feel without being too formal; love the windows & comfortable chairs. It's kind of a 'downtown brunch' with all the brunch trends & fusion style dishes. If you're not too adventurous, you can always stick with the burger or eggs.  I had the French Toast with strawberry coulis, popsicle & cotton candy. Such a playful dish. The outer edges were hard/dry but the inside was good; I liked it with the strawberries & cream. I also had the White Sangria which was citrusy; I prefer this over the red which was a bit stronger and we didn't like the red wine that was used.   We also had the Cereal Bowl with mango coconut panna cotta, Poke Bowl, Mushroom Toast (w butternut squash & poached eggs) and Burger (with a nice side salad!) - all of which everyone enjoyed!   A welcome addition to Unionville. The menu is innovative & 100% for presentation. Will be back to try dinner!"}
{"text":"This is my first review on Yelp and this restaurant definitely deserves a praise. My boyfriend and I ordered the brussels sprouts, torched salmon, and the pork & pancakes. My favourite was the fried brussels sprouts. The balanced acidity and sweetness of the balsamic vinegar in this dish along with bacon is to die for!  The char siu pork in the pancake dish is melt in your mouth delicious! I loved how every dish had a unique sauce, elevating the main ingredient to the fullest. For dessert, we had the banana pudding with earl grey creme anglaise. The sauce here for me was the star. I thought the cinnamon in the pudding was a tad too strong, but enjoyed it overall. Now last but not least, what made me write this review was our wonderful server, Andrew. He constantly checked up on us and made sure everything is good. He made our night extra special because of his excellent service. I will definitely be returning here to try more of their menu items!"}
{"text":"Perfect spot for brunch. My friend had the Japanese pancake and it was soooo good. I had the sweet pancake (pineapple and coconut - they have daily specials) which was delicious as well. Nice ambience and great service."}
{"text":"Went for the first time this past Thursday and went back with friends on Saturday.  Great new spot on one of my fav streets in the GTA.   Honourable mentions:  Brussel sprouts:  divine. Crispy and delish. I don't even like brussel sprouts and I devoured this appetizer both times.   Paradelle:  I enjoyed this dish immensely as did my friends who had it. Hard to describe but if you like pesto and pasta don't miss this.   Singaporean Chilli Crab:  I hail from the Lion city and this take on a national dish was laudable. If you're expecting what you get in Singapore you'd be disappointed. But the sweet and spicy taste, along with freshly cut red chillies was well done. It was also a lot more filling than I expected. Not the cheapest dish but I found it worth the money.   Burger:  bestie had it and loved it. She's Irish Newfie. She should know lol  Spaghetti squash:  Indian bestie had it and she loved it. And she was the picky eater amongst us.   I think if you're a foodie and like trying new takes on traditional food, this place is a must try. We had great service both times as well and our dinner party looked like something out of the United Colours of Benetton."}
{"text":"Edit: Having to put a second review in after coming here on Valentine's Day for a Prix Fixe menu. They don't usually do a Prix Fixe so this is a seperate review.   I'm giving this a 3.5 because of the great service. The problem I noticed right away was the main course, the steak, was really dry.  Why was it dry? It was probably sliced and left under a heat lamp or left dying on the pass. I wasn't a fan of that as I assumed the steak would've been served after it had been grilled/seared and rested. All the juices drained away and it was really dry, regardless of the cook (medium rare).   Otherwise it was great.  They presented us an amuse bouche duck dish and an appertif chocolate bar dessert.   However, given that this was valentine's day and it was a special event, I was expecting a better main course."}
{"text":"+Their menu is excellent with interesting fusion food items +Food is delicious - been here a few times and have not let me down yet! +Service is good"}
{"text":"I've been here several times since my first review and the service has improved gradually. On this visit, the service was top notch! Our server was very patient and attentive, taking the time to explain each dish to us and even making recommendations.  The duck special (sous-vide breast, medium rare, with cinnamon, orange, cauliflower, and barley) was delicious! It should be a regular item on the menu!  The food has been consistently good and delicious. The service on this visit earned them 5 stars! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Went here because our favourite restaurant had closed. Picked this place because of the reviews. What a find!  Everything from the bread and butter through dessert was incredible and a joy to experience - one where the first to the last bite just made you pause and savour it.   There were 4 of us and we ended up sharing everything because you wanted everyone to experience what you were experiencing. The pork and pancakes is a must have, the duck wing appetizer had amazing complexity of flavours. The staff were very attentive. The whole experience was a joy. Can't wait to go back and try their brunch!"}
{"text":"Stepped in and were warmly welcomed!  We were seated in the dining room with leather comfy chairs.  The dining room is separated with the lounge; which has a bar with casual setting.  The décor of the dining room is modern and elegant.  It has big windows all around with natural lights coming through them before dusk.  Our server is cheerful, friendly and attentive.  She went through the menu and gave recommendations. She asked whether we had any food allergies before placing our orders.   We had: 1. Duck wings: skin is crispy and meat is tender 2. Mushroom gyoza: love that earthiness taste of truffle 3. Torched salmon:  salmon piled up on top of crunchy wild rice with spicy sauce.  The salmon were cooked medium rare and melted in our mouths.   4. Banana bread:  moist warm bread with molten chocolate in the center and whipped cream on top.  Delicious dessert!!  Every dish is beautifully plated on color plates; food and plate are harmonized and liven up!  (Honestly, I'm bored with white dinnerware.)  I will definitely come back again and again............."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their appetizers !! Favourite is the bone marrow and Brussels sprouts !! The building and environment is very aesthetically pleasing. The only downfall, I would give is it is their entree might need some work. It was either too salty or just too dry. :/"}
{"text":"Its hard to find places in the burbs where you can enjoy a decent meal in a relaxed cool atmosphere and then walk around outside to digest (or make room for ice-cream). Love the decor and the dishes are well balanced unique offers. Appetizers start at $9 (fried brussel sprouts) to $20 (salumi board). For mains we had the grilled octopus (with a chilli cashew paste that was to die for), a huge plate of humus+lamb sirloin so tender it melted in my mouth, flat iron steak (delicious), and the hot fried chicken (2 pieces only so not that filling for my partner & not that hot because he is a desi man and they love their chilli). WE WILL BE BACK...for the Singaporean chilli crab and bone marrow. They do have a bar where we saw one or two people pop in for a drink."}
{"text":"I was very excited when I heard of this restaurant and wanted to try! I came here for a late lunch with few of my girl friends. The ambiance of this restaurAnt is very nice and quite intimate, so i feel like it's a good place for a romantic date. The server were really nice as well although i feel like it lacks a bit of communication, because I left lot of my side dishes and wasn't ask how was my meal or what was wrong with it, just took it n off they he went....  I ordered myself piranha for my main course. Some of my girlfriends order different dishes. I am only reviewing for the one I ordered only.   My dish comes with steak, some beans with chorizo... it wasn't what I was expecting, didn't like the side dish of the bean, it was a mixture of bean and barely any chorizo and the sauce was like tomato sauce... not the way I like it, expected something more Brazilian type or central/South American style. Steak was good but a bit dry from lack of sauce, it is served with chimichurri but it didn't taste like it much, I grew up from South America and i know what chimichurri taste like, nothing like what I was served.... my dish cost me 25$.  Oh I will review the duck drumstick(or was it wings??)they were fabulous. Like it a lot! Very crispy."}
{"text":"Love the location. I sat bar side for brunch one weekend because there was a wait. Cute little place, I liked the decor. The menu was interesting to say the least. Cool asian-fusion concept, lots of layers and flavors. I like keeping it simple though so I ordered a PLAIN avocado toast. Bread & mashed avocado with sea salt and fresh cracked pepper. Would've appreciated some lemon juice and red chili pepper flakes, but I didn't want to annoy the waiter. I LOVED their strawberry guava mimosa, you can tell the quality of their ingredients are superb and fresh. The staff was friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Tucked away in a residential neighbourhood, this restaurant provides a unique and lovely atmosphere paired with great service. Appetizers stood out, particularly the bone marrow + tartar, salmon pate, and beat salad. A sous vide shortrib with a creative corn bread purée makes for interesting flavours, followed by a decadent Nutella-focused dessert. Hamburger was average, duck wings (while generously portioned) were over-cooked and overwhelmed by ketchup flavour. Some hits, some misses, but ultimately an enjoyable experience. We will return."}
{"text":"This new Asian fusion Canadian restaurant has great food, but I probably wouldn't be visiting very often as it is VERY overpriced for the size of their dishes. I ordered the salmon with wild rice. The rice has a popcorn texture (very airy and crunchy) and the salmon was salmon belly so very fatty. Overall my experience was great. The staff are all very friendly. They also gave us complimentary dessert since they overheard we were there for my friend's birthday!"}
{"text":"If you are hoping to get the regular menu at NextDoor on the weekend... you ain't gonna get it. Weekends serves only brunch and the menu is quite limited and nothing out of the ordinary except the French toast with a popsicle on the side. We had several items and our favourites were the shackshuka. The okonomiyaki pancakes balance was weirdly off. Both friends who ordered it was not a fan of how it tasted as the pancake is made from an ACTUAL SOFT pancake and not fried like the ones you find in izakayas. It didn't pair off well with bacon and maple syrup and kewpie mayo. I definitely will not return fot brunch... but we will return to conquer the weekday menu."}
{"text":"I've given this place another chance for brunch and I still can't get into it. Sad because I really wanted to like this...  It was packed inside today with no parking left, but we parked just a little further up main street behind the stores. While we had to wait a bit for a table, it definitely wasn't a long wait for 12pm - maybe 5ish minutes.   We ordered the okonomiyaki pancakes ($18) and crab on brioche ($17). Now I don't mind paying for good food. at all. What I do mind is paying these prices for food that wasn't good.  The okonomiyaki pancakes had good flavors but it was just too much of everything and it ended up being a really salty dish with the kewpie mayo, sweet teriyaki-style sauce, bacon, and bonito bits. So much salt. I was so thirsty afterwards. The best part of this was the poached egg as it was nice and runny. I'd prefer the egg whites to be softer but it was fine. The pancakes weren't as dry as last time I had the chashu pancakes for dinner.  The crab brioche was pretty disappointing - toast definitely looked burnt and this seems to be a common theme with their items on toast, including the avocado toast, mushroom toast and french toast. I'm not sure why they seem to do this so consistently when I've seen many comments about burnt toast. It makes a big difference. The crab salad was supposed to be warm but it felt a bit cold. With the corn, the flavors didn't mesh well with the poached egg.   We thought about getting a dessert but after these two... no. I have a feeling it would be too sweet as well. Their french toast is topped with candy floss (so cotton candy) and a popsicle.  Their pancakes of the day was strawberry shortcake - white chocolate pancakes with strawberry coulis and whipped cream.  Do yourself a favor make the trek downtown if you're going to pay these prices. You'll get something much better and it'll be worth your while."}
{"text":"Excellent place, with the nicest staff.  The place is cosy and food is unbelievable. I ordered the Avocado Toast and recommend it in a heartbeat.  The only thing that I would suggest is having options for kids - which they didn't have at the time I was here."}
{"text":"Love the interior of the place and the large surrounding windows gave a lot of natural lighting for a great brunch environment. Food was great. presentation was beautiful and tasted delicious. I had the Okonomiyaki which was a nice fusion between Japanese style pancake and the bacon added the Canadian touch. My friends had the Poke bowl and White chocolate french toast, both were great. Staff was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday night with no reservations. The dining and lounge areas were all booked so we happily took the patio. Perfect weather.  We ordered the following:  1) Duck Wings $10 2) Roasted Bone Marrow $12 3) Torched Sashimi Salmon $15 4) Lamb Sirloin $24 5) Coke $3.25  Plates were all represented beautifully.   The meat on the Duck Wings were moist and just perfect. A little too heavy on the sauce for our liking, but everything was delish!  Our favourite, and won the whole show was the Roasted Bone Marrow with beef tartare. The bread was fresh +1  Torch Sashimi Salmon comes in second as my favourite. Everything about it was perfect. The puffed wild rice was a nice touch.  We were most disappointed with the Lamb Sirloin dish. It came out barely even warm. The meat had a dull surface, because it was cold; and fried basil was not crunchy. The plate looked amazing, and the flavours worked well together, just wished it wasn't so cooled down.  We also thought it was kind of strange that everything all came out together. Appetitizers and entrées were all served at once, and our little table could barely fit all the plates.   It was weird that these dishes came out so quickly - everything was prepped and ready to go! It isn't neccessarily a bad thing, but it sort of disturbed our dining experience. We couldn't finish our hot appetitizers without worry our hot entrées getting cold.  Overall, a very solid 4 stars.  I want to come back and try their brunch menu. Quality at Smash has declined over the years and I have fully stopped going there. I hope the quality here keeps up. Great location with lots of parking at the side."}
{"text":"This restaurant is the newest addition to Markham, located just off Unionville Main Street. There is indoor and outdoor seating, perfect timing since summer is coming up; another place for drinks on the patio.   Making reservations here is easy and can be done on their website. Greeted by the hostess, he was very friendly and made us feel welcome.   We got seated on the patio and given menus. The dishes on the menu are perfect for sharing, as the portions are just right. My boyfriend and I ordered the following: Rice Cakes, Ox Tongue Yakitori, Grilled Octopus and Flat Iron Steak.   The main dishes were delicious, each dish is Asian fusion so it creates a nice twist to each dish in terms of texture and flavour. The Grilled Octopus was perfectly charred and cooked just right, the watercress and purée enhanced the overall flavours. The Flat Iron Steak was equally as good but the only thing was the temperature of the food was not hot but merely warm and became cold a lot faster than expected.   Ox Tongue Yakitori, not sure what was so great about it. It was bland and forgettable. I wasn't thrilled about it and nor was my boyfriend; I guess this was a \"miss\" for us.   Overall, service was fairly good except for a couple of mishaps of \"almost\" being given the wrong food. I noticed this happened many times through the night but I assume the restaurant will work out the kinks. Food was interesting and worth trying, I'm definitely willing to come back to try the brunch menu next time."}
{"text":"Amazing vibes and food! So happy I found this place. I was craving a good cocktail and read some good reviews here. Because I had other place to go after, I only tried one drink and a few plates. I triad the dark and stormy - dark rum, black pepper syrup, ginger, and lime. Delicious! I usually go for fruity and girly but this may be my new fave. The black pepper gives it a nice spicy kick.  Bread and homemade butter were also delicious. I mean, I love bread, but homemade butter? That just kicks their competitors out the window.  Guacamole and torched uni was also delicious and served with seaweed chips which were interesting. We also had the suckling pig dish which was decent. It wasn't my fave as the pig was a bit dry and not like the Asian version I'm used to but the flavours were good.  This is definitely a great place for date night, or family and friend gatherings. Huge space, big patio, lounge area, cozy ambiance, chic furnishings, delicious food. Wow I said delicious so many times in this review.  Note: Cocktails Happy Hour from 12-5, and 9-close"}
{"text":"A great little place with a view on picturesque Main Street Unionville.  They had a bunch of happy hour specials going on Monday night and since we arrived before 6pm, we were able to benefit. Nice.  We tried: Duck wings Bread with brown sugar butter Fried Brussels sprouts to start. All delicious  For dinner I had halibut which was cooked perfectly and nicely sized. For dessert a couple of us shared the chocolate raspberry dish which was like a dark chocolate peanut butter cup with raspberry sorbet which was very yummy.  Good service and for the quality of the meal the pricing was excellent. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"NextDoor has a very unique menu with great flavours and style! Apparently the same owners as Smash which I've always been a fan of - I definitely needed to give this restaurant a try. NextDoor is located in the old planning mill on Mainstreet Unionville, where the pub used to be. The patio was quite nice to sit on for dinner but the tables were a bit tiny given this restaurant serves a sharing type menu (we had lots of plates!). Not the cheapest, but good value for the cool menu. We spent abut $45 each with one drink each (beer).  We ordered: - Bone Marrow Beef Tartare (4/5) - Solid bang for the buck at $12, this was a great beef tartare served in a bone.  - Duck Wings - (3.5/5) - Saw lots of people recommend it but I didn't find it particularily good. Not much meat, but the flavours were good. - Flat Iron Steak (4/5) - nicely cooked, served with a blend of sauces  - Salmon (5/5) - this was my highlight, salmon served with a bed of crispy rice  I'd recommend!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 10 people and 18% tip was automatically added to the bill - no wonder why the service was poor.   I ordered a coffer before the my meal came and the coffee came after I finished eating. Same thing with other people's drinks. We believed they had forgotten our drinks order.  My Mushroom Toast - the poached eggs, mushroom, and bread were warm. The butternut squash dices and puree were COLD. Same issue with other people's meals. Everything was cold or warm at best.   The bottom line is I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for brunch or lunch.  Not sure if dinner is better, but I will not be going back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Had brunch here in September and it was AMAZING!  We ordered the: - okonomoyaki pancakes: Super delicious! Nice savoury Asian twist on pancakes. - White Chocolate French Toast: If you love sweets like me, you'll adore this gorg brick of toast! Cotton candy, popsicle, whipped cream AND strawberries! Yes! - Poke bowl: Good and fresh!   Service was great and attentive!  Just beware of the bees if you choose to sit in the outdoor patio!   Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a corporate event. The restaurant is clean and modern, however it was pretty cold inside and atmosphere wise as well. I had the fish and chips which was top notch, probably the best i ever had. It beats even specialized seafood restaurants. I also tried the poke bowl and the burger that some co workers ordered :)) and those were great at well. Tasty food, polite and fast staff! Will go back for..."}
{"text":"Their salmon with puffed rice is very good. Very interesting as I never had puffed rice which felt like popcorns but rice and it went really well with the salmon.  Their other dishes were good as well but the most memorable one is definitely the salmon with puffed rice."}
{"text":"We had dinner here. We ordered the Octopus Carpaccio, slices of octopus wrapped in potato salad with a regular salad on top. The salad was good but IMO the octopus and potato salad didn't go well together at all. We then had the Picanha, a Brazilian steak. It was cooked nicely but the chimichurri had to be removed as it was overwhelming the dish. We also had the NextDoor Burger. It had dry patties. Nuff said. Overall an unexpected underwhelming experience as it was Smash Kitchen & Bar's sister restaurant."}
{"text":"Go here for a date night! The patio overlooks the mill / man made pond right in the heart of Main Street unionville and the food options are unique and tasty. We tried the charcuterie board with a side of delicious bread, torched salmon and  charred octopus. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I am so happy this restaurant exists in Markham! I feel like I would be able to grab a decent meal without having to drive all the way downtown. I visited twice recently. Once for brunch and once for dinner.  Let me start with the brunch. The white chocolate French toast was amazing! I felt like I ate a unicorn because the French toast was topped with a popsicle and cotton candy! I was worried (after I got over how pretty it looked) that it would be way too sweet, but the sweetness level was actually reasonable. I know a lot of guys don't like sweet stuff so this definitely wouldn't be for them. But I enjoyed the meal so much and this is also one of their most popular item from the brunch menu.  I went back a week later for a birthday dinner and was still impressed with the quality and choice of food. We ordered the bone marrow, Brussel sprouts, duck wings to start. The Brussel sprouts were my favourite, they were so good and I don't even usually eat Brussel sprouts. Contrary to other reviews I didn't really like the bone marrow because the beef tartar that they place on top actually covers the natural flavours of the bone marrow. And the reason I took off 1 star is because the pan seared duck I got for my main was a bit stiff...so while the flavours were good and I liked that it was served with barley, it was a little hard to chew. Nonetheless I had enough good dishes at this restaurant that I will probably go back."}
{"text":"It's quite an interesting find which is also a new restaurant to the unionville main street area.  Opened just 4-5 weeks ago, the menu is very unique which adds to the interesting restaurants along the street all uniquely their own.  Ordered bone marrow, duck wings, spaghetti squash, torched salmon and pork + pancake.  I would say the duck wings and spaghetti squash are the best out of the 5 dishes.  Each dish is definition asian meets american style.  They are all flavourful, not too salty and portion sizes are good.  If you love spicy, i would recommend asking the if the bone marrow and duck wings (which were suppose to be spicy) to up the spice level by 2 notches which will being it to mild.  Great for sharing.  My only negative point which made the 5 stars vs 4 stars difference is that the dishes were not hot enough.    Overall loved the places, decor and creative menu"}
{"text":"Food was tasty, service was also great!   I ordered the salmon poke bowl without crab salad due to shellfish allergies; it was heavenly! My vegan friend also ordered mushroom toast without poached eggs and she loved it. Too bad our server did not give us a discount for not wanting the two poached eggs that was supposed to come with the entree...it would have been a solid 5 star experience."}
{"text":"I really liked it the first time I was there, especially the cheese board was exceptional. Ever since then, it has been hot and miss.  The pancake special today looked great. All the sides were great but the pancakes were a bit stiff and dry."}
{"text":"The interior design of this place is very modern with nice touch of brick and wood accents. Fair amount of open space.   Recommends making reservations*.   I've came here twice for brunch and once for dinner. They offer your typical brunch items such as avocado toast, pancakes, eggs/bacon but they have your not-so-average items like their Okonomiyaki and Poke (which had barely any salmon pieces). The first time I came here for brunch, I got their avocado toast which was delicious - egg perfectly runny, toast was not soggy and the beet hummus complimented the avocado really well.   For dinner, we ordered the bone marrow - great flavour. Just wished they gave us more bread. As for my main, I tried their spaghetti squash - it was both crunchy from the potato strings and soft from the squash. Incredibly creamy coconut flavour. I wasn't expecting to like it but I was proven wrong - definite must try! My sister got the torched sashimi salmon and it was not filling at all. This item is more of a appetizer than it is a main.   Good food, decent service, worth checking out if you haven't been"}
{"text":"Overhyped restaurant serving mediocre food with little depth, on a side of customer service that says \"we don't give a **** about you\". First off, super excited about brunching here: good yelp reviews, personal recommendations, I love Smash...should be promising? NOPE!  Booked a table, got here early, hostess told me to sit at the front while my table \"gets ready\", but I waited and waited...no one had any intention to seat me when there are an abundance of reserved tables all set and ready to go. I asked 5mins after my supposed reservation time and was immediately seated at those same unoccupied tables. My friends were running late, but no one bothered to ask if I wanted a drink or anything you'd expect as proper service. I wanted to get something warm, requested for someone and they rolled their eyes at me, had no clue what tea was available. After I ordered, 3 different people came by to checked if I did order something but none of them ended up bringing anything. When everyone got here, took forever for them to take our orders, the server didn't jot it down and FORGOT our orders and had to return. My earl grey came, had sugar on the side, no spoon or milk. I requested for both twice but was forgotten so I just gave up. Both are items you'd expect with a tea the first time around. I got the recommended mushroom toast and have absolutely nothing good to say about it. It had 2 poached eggs over some mushrooms, squash and arugula on a toast. There was also squash puree at the bottom. It was just bland and not cohesive. The squash, puree, eggs, arugula, toast all screamed for some form of salt or spice. Individually they taste bland and together they don't work. The mushiness of the squash and the sogged up toast from the puree and yolk was just a blended together blob. There is just nothing exciting about it. The mushrooms are the only thing that taste of anything in this dish but they had a weird mealy texture as if dirt wasn't washed off properly. Like other diners, the servers constantly came to try and collect our plates when we were obviously still eating. Portions run extremely small for their value, I left still hungry. Overall, very disappointing, especially since I am a fan of their sister restaurant SMASH. I would not come again or recommend."}
{"text":"This is a nice find in our Unionville neighbourhood. Visited once in the summer of '17 and a couple more times in late fall of the same year. Took my family and friends there and everyone enjoyed the food and service for the most part. The dishes are more fusion like and personally, I find it to be very creative. They were also very busy in the summer, but we were also able to do a nice weekday lunch with our dogs in their lovely patio! I loveee that, such a lovely bonus!!"}
{"text":"I am a fan - I would give it 5 stars but I have some recommendations to make them a local star to attract more people. - some better costing and some flexibility. We ordered everything to share - we loved everything. The meat, the beet spaghetti, the squash WOW. They make their own cheese and pickle food like cantaloupe - sound weird? Tastes like apple pie!!  Pricing depends on if you order drinks or not. For us it was definitely over 60 per person - there was 3 of us - girls dinner. Lovely spot."}
{"text":"Pretty good brunch food. Going in early does help but plenty of seats. A bit of Asian Fusion with american food."}
{"text":"It's quite difficult to put into words how delicious this culinary experience was, all I suggest is that you book a reservation now so you can dine at NextDoor.   My family and I have dined at the priciest most exquisite restaurants, however NextDoor has easily became our fav due to its indescribable flavours and changing menus. The inside of the restaurant is modern with several tables, I still haven't dined on the patio but thats on my list of to-dos.   Before I tell you about the dishes I first want to make a special mention to Laura our waitress who was incredible, attentive and super helpful!  Be prepared to drool...  Duck Wings: perfectly cooked, crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. Piled high drizzled with this tangy sauce that I legit licked off the plate.   Roasted Bone Marrow: This dish is great to share with one other person as it comes with fresh baked bread and is easily enough for 2.   Fried Brussel Sprouts: Okay.... I don't know where to begin- this dish was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I don't know what is was, but the way they cooked the brussel sprouts and made them lightly crisp bursting with flavour is magical. I would order this as my main with some protein and be the happiest person ever.   Braised Short Rib: The meat was perfectly cooked, and cut like butter. I loved this but personally couldn't eat it all because it is very filling. It is paired with this out of the world scallop potato type thing which everyone was fighting over. Totally suggest this dish!  Chicken Roulade: This tasted like Thanksgiving on a plate, it was magically delicious. It's hard to describe the textures and flavour from this dish- go try it for yourself!  Torched Sashimi Salmon: For me, this was my FAV dish. It tasted like a gourmet sushi meal, minus the starchy rice.. but adding the delicious greens and amazing sauce. The fish was so perfectly cooked, that is some serious talent. I probably could eat this every day for dinner if I had the chance.   ALSO the real MVP is their butter that comes with their freshly baked bread.. it is butter on crack.   IF you have room for dessert I would suggest the Pineapple one-- ask your server, they will know. Real Winner.  I cannot wait to come back to try more dishes AND of course their brunch- which I hear is a winner.   I seriously wish this restaurant was Next Door to me.. I would go every meal."}
{"text":"Looking for a nice walk on a nice day? Looking for a patio for a nice chat and to people watch on union villa main-street? Or are you looking for some place new to try with great service and a menu that changes every so often? Sorry I'm not trying to sound like I'm advertising, simply just crossed my mind when I was looking for a place that covered these criteria's :) This is a place I go to if any of those thoughts crossed your mind"}
{"text":"We've been back at least two times now and each visit has always a pleasant experience. Service was friendly and excellent overall. It was also easy to make reservations.  I love the Torched Sashimi Salmon (Maple soy / puffed wild rice / pickled cucumbers togarashi aioli. Sooooo yummy but wish the portion was just a little bigger. Next Door is great for groups, date night and families. They actually had room for our massive stroller.   Parking: Ample parking just behind the restaurant  Can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"The patio is really nice on a sunny day, but the menu was not only quite limited for lunch but also very disappointing.  The poke bowl, which the waitress said was the among the most popular dishes, was very underwhelming and very little toppings. The sushi rice was overdone and very sticky. The next door burger was chewy and difficult to eat. The toppings tasted okay in the first few bites but quickly got way too greasy."}
{"text":"Nice place, good service, decent prices.  Just don't expect huge portions, you won't be hungry after but you won't be full either (and who says you have to be).  i like how dinner is not much more expensive unlike most places where they may give you a huge portion but then also charge you high prices.  I rather have it fresh and this place has good portion control."}
{"text":"NextDoor (ND) finally opened its doors 2 weeks ago! Lots of unique tapas styled dishes on the menu, inspired by Chef Isaac Co from sister restaurant, Smash Kitchen. I've always been a huge fan of Smash, so definitely have to come show support for ND :)  I brought my girlfriends here on Saturday during their first brunch service and we were very impressed. The French Toast was absolutely our favourite with the cotton candy, strawberry cream popsicle and fresh ingredients. It was definitely not as sweet as the regular ones we usually have. I really enjoyed this version, and the presentation was beautiful.  We also shared the Acai Bowl - it really tasted like a smoothie topped with strawberries, raisins, coconut shreds and all that goodness ^^ You definitely won't feel guilty eating this because it is so healthy! The Okonomiyaki (savoury pancake) topped with bacon and poached eggs was definitely a nice twist on traditional pancakes. It was quite filling for us girls but definitely a great dish to share.  P.S. I really enjoyed sitting in the dining room area because of the rustic but classy ambiance, and because of the natural sunlight - perfect for food shots!  I will definitely be back again to try more new creations! Keep up the great work, ND :)"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a weekday with a friend. I loved the quiet atmosphere as it makes the perfect spot to catch up and chat. I would take away a star because the cutlery was not clean. The fork had dried up food left on it and made me question their dishwasher. Anyways the waitress gladly replaced it for me and I rather rate the restaurant based on their food.  The food however was definitely five star worthy. I ordered the okonomiyaki style pancakes. To be honest, I didn't mean to order pancakes because I dislike them. I didn't read the menu correctly and thought it was the traditional style okonomiyaki. When it arrived I really doubt I was going to enjoy it but oh my god it was delicious. Savoury pancakes are a stroke of genius. The crispy bacon and two poached eggs combined with the traditional sauces and seasoning of okonomiyaki made this dish a perfect creative fusion. This dish redeemed pancakes for me, I will defiantly be returning to have it again."}
{"text":"Went to this nicely decor fusion restaurant for dinner.  Overall food is pretty good and pricing is reasonable. Not many items on the menu.  Hope they will add more in the future or some seasonal changes.  We had ordered the duck wings (it's not bad but nothing special), duck liver paté (very smooth texture and tasty), bone marrow with beef tartare (they actually quite match when serving together as you mouth would not be only filled with oil from the bone marrow while at the same time you don't lose the flavor of the tartare), spaghetti squash (tasty Thai style sauce), and lamb sirloin (this is really good. Like the way it was spiced). We also had Sangria.  Well,  I love sangria but so far I haven't found anywhere in Toronto serving good sangria as I always missed the ones that were super tasty and only costing 3 from Spain....  Service was nice, somewhat too nice.  My only suggestion is it would be better if she doesn't come over to asked how's the food like 5 times during our meal. Overall experience was good and i would come again."}
{"text":"I don't usually post reviews, but this was by far the worst service that I've ever gotten at a restaurant for a long time. I've been here before 2x (once for dinner and once for brunch) and I enjoyed the food and my experience there, so I decided to bring my parents here for dinner on a quiet and rainy Wednesday. Just to set the scene, we walked in and they didn't have any business. We were seated and right from the get-go, you can tell the server wasn't into it as she wasn't being very friendly. Approx 2 mins in after we were seated, she was like have you decided what we wanted....and I was like no, can you give us a couple mins and she rudely walked away. We were like okkk, but giving her the benefit of the doubt as everyone has bad days, we were like no problem, it happens! As we were ordering food, and started asking her questions about the menu, you can clearly tell that she was annoyed. Another example of how rude she was was when my mom asks for hot water, she brings it to her, drops it at the table....but it was like a feet away from her. But again, we were like no problem. Food comes and she brings the steak knives 5 mins later, fine, cool, whatever. When we finished dinner, we ended up sitting at the table for a good 10-15 mins with our plates and water glasses empty cause she hasn't come and refilled our water once or checked up on us once. I had to get up and walked to the other side of the room to refill the water at our table, but there was still no sight of her or any of the servers during this time. I had to go to the bar on the other side of the restaurant to ask for the bill from the bartender. Again, I get it, everybody has bad days, but this was unacceptable, especially when it wasn't even busy and you can hear chatter from the kitchen this whole time. I was a fan of this place before, but it only takes one bad experience (food was fine btw) to ruin it for your customers. I hope you will educate your servers or this particular server on what good service is. Thanks."}
{"text":"Had the duck wings to start. Had good taste, was nicely fried and was quite tender. Then we had the cevatelli. The sauce was very light, but a little flavorless. We also had the roasted duck. It was okay but not amazing. Only the base of lentils was really good.  Overall the food felt very healthy, down to earth and  homey."}
{"text":"Hot fried chicken was really good.  A little spicy. Skin was crispy and meat was tender.  Yummy.  Torched salmon was good too.  Half raw.  The wild rice adds a lil crunch for the dish.  The bone marrow with beef tartar was interesting but I didn't like the cilantro taste.  Too much that it covered the bone marrow flavor and it just taste a lil weird.   Service was excellent. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Found it while searching for dinner on a business trip (thank you Yelp!), and it exceeded expectations. Excellent food, well presented, creative menu and great service! The desserts are to die for, though the lamb could have been better. Can't wait to eat there again!"}
{"text":"Coming back from a foodie city, this place was OK. It was nothing special and prices were average. I'll give it another try but I am not sure what the rave for this place is all about. I would consider changing the seasoning on the fries."}
{"text":"It's a nice place but when we went, it was a bit noisy. I'm not sure if it was the crowd or if the restaurant just allowed for a lot of it based on structure.  My friends and I sat in the corner and we could barely hear one another. Any way, I ordered the duck wings and brussel sprouts along with a cider. The cider actually came in a wine glass and it was interesting because I normally don't get cider in a wine glass.   The food was decent and unique but the price is pretty up there."}
{"text":"NextDoor serves up trendy North American cuisine with a refined and relaxing ambiance.  We came for a summer dinner and were able to get a table outside in the sun. The patio is pretty large and gives a good view of Main Street and some other downtown Unionville buildings.  The menu is always changing, but it has a decent variety of options to please most people. We enjoyed the oysters and the fried Brussels sprouts as our appetizers. Then for the main course, I got the suckling pig, which was savory and delicious. The menu definitely errs on the slightly pretentious, slightly hipster side, with ingredients such as \"parmesan snow\" (aka grated parmesan), ikura (red caviar), \"leek purée,\" and chicharrón (pork rinds). But it all tastes good regardless, so don't worry too much about the jargon.  The service was a bit slow, which left us there longer than we wanted to be. But on the whole, it was an enjoyable meal. Check it out for a charming and relaxing experience in quaint Unionville."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times for brunch and finally got around to write a review.    Since we moved to the boonies, we rarely make it to my favourite brunch spots which are all downtown.  When my brunch cravings kicks in, Next door we go!  Their brunch menu offers exactly what I like,  creative and somewhat healthy dishes!  I've had their shakshuka, mushroom toast, pancakes, okonomiyaki, poke bowl and I thought all the dishes were good. It's not delicious but good.  Why not delicious? Let me break it down with the mushroom toast and suggest (IMO) what would of made it better. First is the toast, it's like thick Texas toast, so when the yolk start running, combined with a creamy sauce from the mushroom, it makes the bread very soggy, not a great texture to put in your mouth. A toasted baguette would have been more ideal.  The dish also came with butternut squash purée, very creative but again, I got soggy bread, creamy mushroom and now purée, it's just all too much moosh. Felt like I was eating baby food. I would have love for the mushroom to be just pan fried with olive oil, salt and pepper.   I still like ND and will continue to come here. The service is good, price is fair and most importantly, they got great coffee and there's free refills. Bonusssss!"}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise!   I had read and seen so many positive things about this restaurant so I'm happy I finally got to try it for myself!   The restaurant is really modern and elegant, with high ceilings, cool light fixtures and rustic looking table tops. It wasn't very loud so it's a good place for a date however, surprisingly, I saw a lot of people having casual family dinners as well!   The menu is small and seemingly ever-changing. There were a lot of things that were appealing to me on the menu, from appetizers to main dishes. It was hard to choose but the waitress did a good job at recommending dishes based on their popularity and her personal favorites.  For appetizers we tried the bone marrow, duck wings and Brussel sprouts. My favourite were the Brussel sprouts and the bone marrow. The duck wings werent as warm as I had hoped and I found them to be on the dry side, the flavours were pretty good though, and I think they took the feedback from people saying that the portion size was small because the portion is now 5 pieces which I thought was good for the price. The Brussel sprouts were amazing, crispy, sweet and delicious. I'm not a fan of Brussel sprouts usually but these I loved! The bone marrow was also delicious, covered in beef tartar, it was succulent and flavourful.   For a main, I had the short rib dish. The meat was good, I especially enjoyed the sauce, I do with there was a bit more. Also the potato purée which was pretty much mashed potatoes, were delicious but, again, I wish there was more on the plate. I think for some of these dishes, the focus is more on the aesthetic, they were so beautifully plated and executed but some of the portion sizes, I thought, were too small. Unless you have a small appetite, I'd say an appetizer or dessert will be needed, which I suppose is not always a bad thing!   The service was really good, water and wine glasses were filled eagerly, and she gave us some great suggestions for the food. Some of the vocabulary on the menu is a bit more foodie-centric but she was able to clear up any questions we had.  Overall I enjoyed my meal here! I think the portion sizes were a bit small, but I get that they're going for a more fine dining experience. The ambiance is pretty casual and prices are decent considering the quality of the food. I think the menu was slightly limited, lots of vegetarian and vegan options which is nice but I'd almost rather less frills and more of the delicious food.   I would definitely come back in another season to see what's new on the menu!"}
{"text":"Right off the bat, I gotta hand it to this sudden wave of  foodie entrepreneurs entering Markham. All of these fresh new restaurants that are present in markham are doing a phenomenal job- they're KILLING it!! Nextdoor has been one of the most memorable dining experiences for me and easily compares to the hottest spots in Toronto.   I have visited on two ocassions and have tried virtually the entire menu. There is nothing I dont like, and there are too many things I like too much.   Among the best appetizers were the brussel sprouts (effing incredible), beef tartare/marrow, and the duck wings. However, every single app has been well thought and, and looks beautiful upon presenting.  One of my favourite dishes that I've tried was their Picanha. Im not sure of its a rolling menu, but of your a beef lover, and if its available, you will not be disappointed.   This place is one of the best and I will absolutely be around more and more."}
{"text":"Had a variety of things off the starter menu the bone marrow is really good and I had the lamb as my main .. everything is great including service."}
{"text":"My family have been here for brunch twice. First time was when they first opened for a week. The experience was good but there was room of improvement. The would say they improved on service of my second visit.   I agreed with some of the reviewers that the sound proof of the place is not very good and it can get noisy, but I think it is still manageable to have a quiet conversation.  Brunch menu has good selection and they are accommodating to remove some ingredients due to food allergy from one of us.   These are the few items we enjoyed very much and would recommend   White chocolate french toast - not a traditional french toast you would have. The presentation is beautiful and it is fun to eat. Toast itself is light and crispy outside and top with strawberry sauce and cream. Since we request the granola to be removed, otherwise, it would be an interesting combination of crispy, crunchy. The white chocolate and strawberry popsicle is creamy and not overly sweet.   Cereal bowl- it is another beautiful presented dish. The coconut shavings and fruit granola are very aromatic. The coconut mango panna cotta is very refreshing.   ND Poke - tuna and salmon are very fresh and go well with the sushi rice. I would say it is more like a sushi bowl than poke. There are lot of ingredient and very filling.   Fresh squeezed strawberry guava juice - very refreshing.   We went there for birthday celebration and they have the birthday person a little desert which is a kind gesture.   I highly recommend to make reservation because it was full house on our second visit."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] 4/5 This place is located on Main Street Unionville. It was a little tricky to find the entrance, but it just follow the signs to the front door on the ground floor.    [SERVICE] - 5/5 Staff were friendly. Servers accommodated our group, constantly checked on us, and sure everything was to our standards.  [DÉCOR] - 5/5  I loved the dimly lit lights and modern décor.  [QUALITY] - 4/5 Very fresh, high-quality ingredients and multi-dimensional flavours in their dishes.   [ORDER] - 4/5 - Torched Salmon Sashimi - $16.00: on a bed of puffed wild rice, and topped with maple soy. Comes with pickled cucumbers, togarashi aioli, and red chilis. The salmon, pickled cucumbers and red chilis were fresh, and went well with the maple soy sauce. For some reason, I thought the wild rice would be soft but it was actually light and crispy. Portion was quite small, but packed with flavours!   [OVERALL] - 4/5 I would definitely recommend this place for their fresh and high-quality dishes. The portions were small, so if you're very hungry, I would advise you to order more than one dish!"}
{"text":"Came on a Monday morning for their Blunch, I'm very glad that they offer brunch on weekdays too!  Ordered the safe side, avocado toast and the white chocolate toast.  Love the avocado toast so much! I don't like beet but the beet sauce came in it tastes so good with the sourdough bread!  Three dishes were too many for me and my friend so we barely had any room for the white chocolate toast (left it for last since it's sweat). The toast was very crispy and I think it was soaked in maple syrup or something before cooked, so it is very sweet as well. I love sweets so it was good for me but alert for people who doesn't!"}
{"text":"THE place for brunch, especially if the weather is good enough to sit on their patio. Good for chilling with a friend, or going with groups.  Situated in lovely Main St Unionville, where it is beautiful all year round imo, is a restaurant for all brunch lovers. This place might be a bit tricky to find at first, but if you know where the water wheel is, you'll have no problem finding it! ND has their own parking lot (it's not too big though), so you don't really have to drive around looking for a parking spot, or parking all the way over at Two Good Pond like a lot of people have to do.  ND has very nice, tall ceiling to floor windows, so you'll get lots of natural lighting, and maybe stare at some people passing by if you're bored. The main dining room isn't huge, but a decent size, hence if you choose to come here on weekends, you might need to book. Seating has a good amount of space between tables/chairs so you don't feel like you're eating with strangers even if you're in the same room. They also have a separate room on the right side of the restaurant, right when at the entrance. Decor is simple and clean, nothing too fancy, which allows you to focus on their food's presentation.  One of their popular brunch menu items is their french toast, which is topped with cotton candy AND a popsicle. Yep. Sugar lovers will be quite content with this. It is beautifully presented and adorned with edible flowers. Almost too pretty to eat. Definite IG moments there. The white choco french toast is sweet, but not heavy or loaded with syrup like most brunch places would do. Imo the popsicle adds a nice finish to it, with its light and creamy flavour. The cotton candy was more for looks; could skip that.  Second dish is the poke bowl, which is everywhere these days. Presentation, again, was done nicely. The dish was also nice and light, but with enough flavours to enjoy. It's also a good portion and balance with the edamame, rice, and salmon.  I'm already planning my next visit here. Be sure to drop by if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and can't wait for my next visit.   The first time was for dinner - I got the torched salmon on puffed rice which tasted awesome. It tasted very fresh and light but still filling. I also got the strawberry shortcake dessert at this visit which was prepared in a mason jar. It tasted awesome! I would recommend NextDoor even just for desserts.   I came the next day for brunch as I really wanted to try the french toast. It was awesome! If you have a sweet tooth, you'll definitely enjoy it.   The staff were really friendly, and the abundance of natural lighting was perfect for food photography!"}
{"text":"The out door patio is lovely. Service was good and food a bit slow.  The oysters were pretty fresh and had a nice crunch to them. Sharing them between 2 people we finished them in 30 secs.  Bone marrow with beef tartare was very disappointing. The presentation was pretty, but little to no marrow, the dish was more bread than anything.  For entrees we ordered the lamb sirloin and octopus. The flavors and presentation were great! I loved how they incorporated different flavors and ingredients. Made their dishes very unique!  And you get what you paid for in terms of portions too.   The lamb sirloin was about $25 and it was very filling and had lots of very tender and well seasoned lamb, hummus, cauliflower/veggies. This dish was definitely middle-eastern inspired with flavours of cumin and pomegranate.  The octopus was $16 and proportion was smaller. One tentacle on top of some watercress and potato puree. The octopus was tender and juicy and the flavours of the dish were light, fresh and well matched. Although the octopus was smaller, it was the perfect portion for me without getting too full so I would have space for some dessert too.  Overall I would definitely come back to try more entrees because the use of flavors were amazing, but the appetizers seemed over price and weren't that great for sharing. We could've done without them."}
{"text":"Long been a fan of Smash, so of course I was excited to try out the sister restaurant NextDoor. Great gem to have in Markham, provides the ambience, service and quality to be expected from a downtown restaurant.   Food options are imaginative with trendy ingredients. Portions are not massive so I recommend getting apps to start. What I've tried and liked: Duck Wings (MUST have), Torched Sashimi Salmon, Mushroom Toast, and Mushroom Grilled Cheese. For burger fans, the ND burger was also a great option. A side note on the popular popsicle item on the brunch menu, aside from the fact that it's highly Instagram worthy, it seems too sweet to have for brunch so it would be good to consider it as a dessert option instead. I myself have never had it, just basing this off comments from other Yelpers and also my observations of other tables who have ordered!  Exceptional service every time I've visited. Great job to NextDoor for being a new go to dinner spot in Markham!"}
{"text":"Overall, I love this place! It has a fancy atmosphere and clean look to it. The downside is that it is hidden and the side is not visible to the people driving by or even walking by. I live a 5 min walk by didn't notice the restaurant until a month after it opened. The food taste amazing!! I have the puff rice with salmon and the burger meals. I was just sad that it was such a small portion :( With that good tasting of food, I can eat like 5 portions! For sure, I will be back there soon with me friends!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love the food here since I loved the ambiance of this restaurant and in particular the patio. Our server was also lovely and attentive even though we were seated at the farthest patio table. Alas, the food and the value for the money was just average for the most part. I guess you are paying for the real estate.    We had brunch here on Victoria Day. I loved the fact that when I called ahead, the front desk put my name down on their list and I then received a text that our table was ready. I wish more establishments did that. I really appreciate not having to wait for a table.   We ordered the Avocado Toast ($16) the next door burger with fries ($18) and the Crab on Brioche ($18). The food was all presented nicely but none of it was hot when it arrived. The biggest disappointment was probably the crab on brioche. The brioche was really thick and just overpowered the rest of the delicate flavors.  The avocado toast was under seasoned as well, although visually very appealing. The sourdough bread was underwhelming and again, the ratio of bread to the other ingredients was off. The dish we enjoyed the most was the burger. Although we asked for it to come without bacon since members of my party don't eat pork, it arrived with a large slab of delicious looking bacon or pork belly.  The burger was flavorful and juicy but the fries were outstanding. We couldn't spot eating them!  Regrettably I forgot to take a picture of that dish.   The portions are decent but not huge so we had room to share the pancakes of the day which were apple pie pancakes with brown butter mousse. The presentation was beautiful but the oatcakes were dense and dry. There was not enough sauce for the three pancakes and the mini marshmallows seemed out of place and unnecessary. The brown butter mousse, however, was amazing. I could just have eaten that for dessert alone and have been satisfied.  In fact I've been dreaming about it ever since...  They had run out of the fresh fruit juices by the time we arrived so we had two iced lattes and a beer.   The bill came to just under $100 before tip. Overall not the best value for the money but not outrageous for the number of dishes we ordered."}
{"text":"The good: I love the design and was so excited to hear that another restaurant opened from the owners of Smash. I came here on Sunday with friends and had brunch. I ordered the avocado toast and also the mint chocolate pancakes. They were nicely presented and had interesting and unique things on their menu.   The bad: The food tasted very mediocre...I didn't find anything special about it. It was good but not amazing. The service was mixed, she wasn't exactly friendly nor was she mean."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite place for brunch! Everything on the menu is really good!! The MUST haves are the French Toast and the shakshuka!"}
{"text":"Came back here for brunch with a large group to celebrate my engagement. Unfortunately, the food was very disappointing.  ND Pancakes ($14) Their featured pancakes were pina colada, which caught my attention since I used to love that drink and really like pineapples. This dish was really sweet, which was kind of expected but what threw me off were how hard and dense the pancakes were. Don't think I've ever had pancakes like that before. So much for fluffy and soft pancakes. I think I only ate like a quarter of my dish.  Okonomiyaki ($17) Pancakes topped with 2 poached eggs, double smoked bacon, mayo and Japanese BBQ sauce with bonito flakes and nori as garnish. The pancakes were really thick, hard, dry, and just not so good. I don't get why the pancakes were so tough.   Crab on Brioche ($17) This dish was okay. The ingredients and flavors didn't go too well with each other, not to mention there wasn't too much crab meat and was really just pieces mixed with corn in with mayo, topped on tomato slices on the brioche. I did not like the brioche at all, did not get the feeling like it was fresh bread.   Mushroom Toast ($15) This was probably the best dish overall, but even then I didn't think it was that great. Lots of mushroom which was great but overpriced imo for what you get. The mushroom lacked a bit of flavor. The egg was perfectly poached, which was probably the only good thing.  French Toast ($16) I honestly got this just for pictures. Came with a lot of sweet ingredients like the popsicle which was good, and cotton candy. Creative, but this dish was too sweet for my liking. I also didn't like the French toast at all. It just tasted like a normal toast, the same one as the Mushroom toast and Crab on Brioche.  Don't think I'd be coming back."}
{"text":"Very comfortable environment They have both outdoor and indoor area, the interior is nicely decorated, service is great, staff is helpful. This is my second time in this restaurant, tried their dinner now coming back for brunch. Their drinks are on point with good selection, pancakes are not too sweet for the chocolate one, but a little bit salty for the okonomiyaki. Overall, a very decent experience, will be coming back in the near future"}
{"text":"My family and I had a brunch here when I found out about this place on Mainstreet Unionville. The main entrance door was a little hard to find so I think it might have been helpful to put up one of those big tent-style signs point in the right direction instead of small signs on each door. Upon entering the restaurant, the environment was quite modern/antique/warm and the service was pretty good with the servers checking in a couple of times. I ordered the Okonomiyaki which was a Japanese pancake with bacon and poached eggs. Really good and got very filling near the end. My one major setback was the type of building it was in which made it very loud, louder and echo-ey than a typical restaurant although I'm not sure if improvements can be made there. Overall, I would definitely visit again to try the dinner and lunch menus!"}
{"text":"Ordered 5 things to share. I do have to mention, that it was a busy day, they had reservations and the only tables available to us were on the patio. We were right beside a heat lamp, but it was still a bit chilly that day and as a result, food got cold pretty quick.  1. Roasted Bone Marrow The bread is the part that's going to fill you up on this dish. Split between 3 people, there's only enough of the bone marrow just for tasting. But the taste is on point.  2. Singaporean Chili Crab I'm not a big fan of crab, but the sauce provided lots of flavour. The dish is highly dependent on the sauce and without it,I don't think there's much to the dish.  3. Lamb Sirloin Lamb served medium rare. Thinly sliced. Very flavourful. Probably my favourite dish of the night. Wish I had more of this.  4. Torched Salmon Sashimi you get a few solid cuts of salmon sashimi lighlty torched on the surface. This was probably my second favourite dish of the night. highly recommend to try this.  5. Grilled Octopus  the most flavourful things in this dish wasn't even the octopus. it was the mashed potatoes, and the other side, which to me, tasted like pepperoni stick. you know, the ones you get at gas stations.  overall. It was a decent meal, but expensive. I expected some of the dishes to hit a lot harder than they did and that left me a bit disappointed. that being said, there is potential."}
{"text":"This place has been reviewed to death already, so clearly the word is out - it's a rising star in the restaurant world, and a great place to grab a bite, drink, and enjoying an evening out near Main street in Unionville.  FOOD:  I ordered the Hot Fried Chicken, which to be honest I underestimated. It was somewhat smaller than I expected, but more than made up for it in terms of taste and experience. Just spicy and crispy enough with its cajun-style batter, and went surprisingly well with the creamed corn and kale. We did not stay for dessert, as we had pre-planned to grab ice cream nearby, by the dessert options here seemed good as well.   SERVICE/ATMOSPHERE:  Our server was friendly and helpful. The food came out surprisingly fast.   This place has a bit of an upscale vibe, with nice decor and well-dressed staff, but was also quite casual as well. Mostly young couples and families on a Friday night.  VERDICT:  I will definitely be back, especially since I had planned to come here with other friends. Will probably try the crab next time I come, as that looked amazing as I saw it going by."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Walked in for a Friday evening dinner with my family. Cozy, intimate ambience.  Ox Tongue, $15. Nice mix of textures but taste wise, nothing to write home about  Roasted Bone Marrow, $14. Favourite dish of the night. Excellent balance of savoury, rich marrow with peppy Vietnamese inspired beef tartare    Torched Sashimi Salmon, $16. Solid dish but nothing out of the ordinary for adventurous eaters.   Picanha, $25. Sirloin cap cooked sous vide on a bed of saucy beans and tomatoes. Well cooked comfort food.  Pan Roasted Pork Chop, $29. Pork was a touch dry and I wasn't a fan of the boudin noir (blood sausage) crumble.  Interesting menu that can be hit or miss. Would come again for the Roasted Bone Marrow."}
{"text":"Highly recommended, food, service and people are amazing. The menu is very short and has very tempting options that makes want to come back and try it. The bone marrow is a must to try, and I also tried the grilled octubos which was perfectly cooked and seasoned and the deep fried chicken I know it sounds heavy but once you have the first bite you just want to eat the whole thing, the flavors are amazing."}
{"text":"This'll be short and sweet.  My visit to NextDoor was spurred on by both the news of the people of Smash Kitchen opening something new, and the desire to try something new.  We got the fried brussel sprouts, NextDoor burger and the ND Poke. The brussel sprouts we're fried nicely, not to the point of bitter burnt, but rather a nice caramelized brown, complimented with double smoked bacon, a balsamic-like syrup and a nice creamy dipping sauce. The poke was very clean and clear with pronounced flavour, a standard poke bowl to me. The burger was very savoury with many sweet tones from the caramelized onions and the cheese. The bacon brought a very strong taste to the burger as well!   Very friendly service and a fairly casual place to dine. Will make another trip sometime in the near future :)"}
{"text":"Good: 1. Ambiance - Trendy place, nice vibe. 2. Food - Unique plates with fresh ingredients. Next Door Burger is good, accompanying rosemary fries not so good.  No flavour and too much batter.  Was pretty odd and I actually didn't finish the fries even though I usually finish everything. Interesting juices but overly sweet. 3. Service - Friendly and easy going.  Neutral: 1. Tables can get a little tight together in the dining area.  Worth it? I've been 3 times already so it's worth it.  The menu draws me in but the food could use some more consistency."}
{"text":"This restaurant needs a five star plus!  This is One of my favourite restaurants that I have been to in Unionville. It is seriously the NEXT step ! Me and my guy went for brunch and the dishes that we have gotten were amazing. The servers are also very kind very nice and they are willing to help you. The food there isn't cheap it's quite expensive, but not that expensive. I recommend this place to your friends/lovers, and get something special that you will remember."}
{"text":"3.5 star  NextDoor is a welcoming addition on Main Street Unionville. A place for brunch/lunch, happy hour, dinner and night cap. That's what we need up in Markham.  The options of making reservation online was a plus. The dining room is spacious and quite comfortable with nature lightnings during the day, best for food photography! (That's so many great photos online!)  NextDoor has a lot of potential to be the \"best\" or \"unique\" restaurant for Markham.   The food though is a hit and miss. I had been here twice: lunch and brunch. There are some items I ordered were excellent - good, and some was meh.    Okonomiyaki ($17) - So salty, really lack of balance. My poached eggs = hard boiled eggs White Chocolate French Toast ($16) - interesting elements Fried Brussels Sprouts ($10) - love the bacon and the maple give it a little sweetness Roasted Spaghetti Squash ($15) - meh.. mushy, soggy and khao soi as not much flavour Duck Wings ($10) - great with beers, I like this!  Sadly looks like they revamped the blunch menu with less choices than before.  Now maybe I have to come back and give their dinner menu a chance as I still have not try their bone marrow yet!!"}
{"text":"Tried their valentines day 4 course dinner. Ravioli doesn't taste fresh, the skin is dry and the texture is not right. The steak is not juicy and their wine paste for the scallop tastes really bad. Their snowball (cocktail) doesn't have advocaat in it and it doesn't taste right. The only good dish the that have is the beef tartare. It's fresh and tasty. Anything else is just bad or not worth it. There isn't any service I barely talk to the server other than taking order and telling him about the ravioli. Ill not come back for their dinner."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant.  I highly recommend their Japanese pancake! I also had their creme brulee pancake, which was there pancake of the day.   I suggest asking them what their pancake of the day is.   They also have daily freshly squeezed juices. Their blueberry mint lavender drink tasted like spring in a cup!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a couple of friends. Although it wasn't too busy we decided to sit at the bar because we like to get up close and personal with staff and initiate conversation. We got the Okonomiyaki pancakes, Avocado toast and Crab on Brioche. Everything we ordered had a lot of unique tastes to them and it was a different brunch experience with a good variety of options available to us.   Sitting by the bar and conversing with the staff was what made the experience more enjoyable. They were very attentive and answered all the questions we had in regards to the ingredients used. Also, what better location than Main Street Unionville!!! There is parking right by the restaurant and what a beautiful place to get together and vibe out.  I also got a Chai Tea Latte and it was super delicious. It was great to enjoy a nice warm drink and take in the nice interior while waiting for the food to be prepared."}
{"text":"I love this place. Creative menu, friendly staff, fresh design creates trendy atmosphere. Good price, good portion, great place to bring friends and chill. Just visited over the weekend, must have their new item on the menu Crab Meat Egg Benedict and the pearl mimosa!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, very trendy place. We had to wait for quite a bit when we got there so I'd recommend making a reservation. The staff were super friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing.  I was in town for business and had a quick search on Yelp to find this place. The pics of the food had me and I set a path to get there.  I do need to note that when I pulled into the lot to park that I was confused by parking signage for another restaurant. Let me save you the confusion - it's the former restaurant so you CAN park here.  When I eventually found the entrance - it's always \"the next door\" I was greeted promptly and asked to sit at the bar since I was solo.  The bartender was very attentive and the restaurant catered to my Keto diet by arranging their menu a little to meet my dietary needs. I didn't want to put them out however they offered. That's a big deal to me.  I ordered the cheese plate and they added a few meats to it in lieu of the accoutrements that did not meet my dietary needs. This was fantastic and should be a regular menu item!  My main course was the Short Rib and they did a purée spinach for me! Fantastic too!  At the end of the day this place is a must try for all. If they cater to customers like they did for me I think you will really enjoy yourself here.  Thanks again Next Door! :D"}
{"text":"Brand new restaurant in unionville with a great selection of dishes.  I ordered the mushroom gyozas and the spaghetti squash which I enjoyed a lot.  Some other cool dishes are their grilled octopus and their torched salmon.  I will have to come back and try the brunch menu."}
{"text":"Restaurant is overhyped IMO. It's a sister restaurant to Smash kitchen but offers different menu. Menu is quite interesting with many unique fusion dishes. Portion is quite small and I'm not a big eater. Food is average; kinda disappointed as I did have high expectations  Restaurant is nice and bright; good ambiance; good place to catch up with friends. Restaurant is located on main street Unionville."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful brunch here with my friends. My favourite dish was the Avocado Toast. The humus combined with the avocado spread was absolutely delicious. I did find the sweeter dishes to be a little too sweet to be a main course, but they are nice eye candies for your instagram feed! There was only one girl working as both the waitress and the hostess since we were there on a weekday, but she took really good care of us. Would love to return for a dinner one day."}
{"text":"Big fan of the sister restaurant, Smash, we had wanted to try here for months.  These restaurants ate amazing culinary experiences for every point of judgement.  Highest quality and creative food and equally great service and attention.  Loved this place!"}
{"text":"Creative with a unique Asian twist.  This restaurant reminds me of Inspire restaurant.  Both restaurants are Asian inspired and a cross between canadian and asian.  the ambiance is nice, price is moderate, presentation of food is picture worthy, but most importantly.  Food is good.   most notably the Duck Wings which were probably my favorite of the night.    Bone Marrow appetizer is definitely Instagram worthy.  But there is only so little room for the marrow and beef to sit.  Therefore the actual amount of food you get will leave you scraping the bone for more.    I got the pancake and char siu main.  Wierd they called it char siu.  It did not taste like the typical char siu you get from chinese BBQ joints.  It was more like fried porkbelly with thick fluffy green onion pancake.  Interesting dish.    One thing to mention is the service.  Very excellent service here.  Drinks were never left empty, and we were checked up on several times with smile on their faces.   I would visit again.  I would hope they keep updating the menu with more creative and unique dishes."}
{"text":"Good was creative and delicious. Great service as well. Portions are a little smaller because they're meant to be shared. Bone marrow and spaghetti squash were great."}
{"text":"Food was ok = 3 stars; plus one star for excellent service   We tried a variety of things on the menu. The Roasted BoneMarrow ($12) with Vietnamese beef tartare, cashews, cilantro and chili was good. The marrow was buttery, rich and creamy. The beef tartare added a light meaty flavour to the marrow. For the price, you get a LOT of marrow. I would order this again.  The Salumi Board ($12) was good with a variety of cured meats. I won't say more since it's pretty hard to screw up #charcuterie.  I LOVED the Fried Brussel Sprouts ($8) which was slightly charred on the outside giving it a nice crunch. The sweet-salty flavours of the maple balsamic glaze and bits of double smoked bacon really put this dish over the top. I actually didn't like the Parmesan aoili that came as a dipping sauce but it was ok because the dish didn't need anything added to it in my opinion.  I think I was less impressed with the mains. I found the Grilled Octopus ($17) bland and a little chewy. Granted, I did ask them to omit the chili and put the Nduja to the side since I can't take too much spice. But I still found the mix of flavours in the dish to be odd. The octopus was served on a bed of potato puree which is uncommon. There was a sour sauce on top of the watercress which was eaten with the puree and octopus, seemed very strange.  The Hot Fried Chicken ($18.50) had a nice crispy skin but was fairly ordinary. The cream #corn could have used a little more corn.  The Spaghetti Squash ($15) is basically Khao Soi made with squash. I generally like less spices but even I found the curry flavour mild.  Overall, I found the restaurant to be a great place to come and hang out with friends over apps and drinks. I might however, hop over to another place for the actual dinner."}
{"text":": NextDoor  : Fried Brussel Sprouts  : I have nothing bad to say about this! Was hesitant to try this out, but definitely made a good choice. I believe that this is a hit or miss because some of my friends didn't like it but I loved it.  : The Brussel sprouts were crunchy in the outside but soft in the inside with a sweet sauce.  : $10 : 8.5/10"}
{"text":"Duck wings: fine but nothing to rave about 3.5/5  Bone marrow: best dish we ordered tonight. Portion isn't enough though  4/5  Grilled octopus: first time it came out, it was fried to a crisp. Completely black, I asked for them to remake it. The second time was a lot better but still a bit rubbery 2/5  Burger: typical, something you can't really mess up   Overall, the service was bleh. Despite making reservations ahead of time, we still had to wait 10 mins while the front desk got their act together. The place was so empty at that point and all the hostesses did was talk to each other about clearly nothing.   Don't get suckered in by reading these other stellar Yelp reviews, this place is mediocre at best."}
{"text":"I can only hope that your next door neighbors can cook as well as the chefs at Next Door, a trendy restaurant in Unionville.  Tucked in a corner of the mill, i can say this restaurant is quaint and trendy at the same time. The choices of food on the menu are not your typical.  From duck wings to ox tongue yakitori for appertizers, i decided on roasted bone marrow - a vietnamese dish of beef tartare infused with cashew cilantro and chilli.  Such exquisite flavour!!   I was totally in heaven with my first experience trying out the bone marrow.  I truly think it's going to be hard to top this experience. 5/5!! For my main, i ordered the chef's special - a duck dish of sous- vide breast, with cinnamon, orange, cauliflower and barley for $21.  It's not on the menu and the waitress said it has been wildly popular, so a couple of us gave it a try.  For my own experience, the duck was hard to cut into.  My friend said maybe the knife was too dull.  The barley was lovely except it was partly soaked in a really salty gravy.  I ended up avoiding using the gravy altogether.  3/5. Since it was my birthday, the restaurant treated me to their dessert on the house.  I chose banana bread pudding since i rarely see this item on menus.  It was a lovely soft dessert.  Sweet and tasty despite the presentation that could be more visual appealing. 4/5. The service was lovely and our server was attentive and pleasant.  A definite must try if you are in this charming neighbourhood."}
{"text":"When I first heard about Next Door, I didn't know if I would like it as I wasn't a fan of Smash. However, I enjoyed Next Door very much! There are lots of choices on the menu and most of the dishes are unique. My personal favourite for brunch is the acai bowl. Grab a seat on the patio during the summer time and order this - it's so refreshing and will leave you energized. I also enjoyed the poke bowl as well. For dinner, we ordered oysters, duck liver pate, spaghetti squash and the pork chop. I definitely prefer their lunch menu over the dinner but that's not to say I won't return for dinner. BUT, there are many things on the brunch menu that I'm still dying to try!"}
{"text":"First off, let me start by saying the food here is absolutely delicious. I will continue to come here solely for the food and not so much the atmosphere or service.   We attended on a busy Friday night, anticipating this,I decided to call ahead and make sure to reserve a seat on the patio. My conversation with the lady who answered went like this:  Her: Hello, thank you for calling NextDoor, How can I help you? Me: Hi, I am calling to make a reservation on the patio.. Her: Ok no problem, what time? Me: How about 7? Her: Sorry, we only have space around 8.. Me: Okay, no problem, ill take it. Her: Actually, we dont take reservations..  Me: uhhhhh, okay.. so just walk in? or..  Her: yeah, sorry..   okay, no problem, maybe she misunderstood, new employee. no big deal. so we arrive at 7.. wasnt busy, got a table on the patio in less than 1 minute.. cool. We sit down, scan the small menu, I guess smaller is better, keeps the dishes more \"fresh\".   We quickly decide on a few different things and end up ordering about 5 different plates. 2 plates come out, The brussel sprouts and the mushroom caps. We slowly but surely polish them off and both were delicious. Our waitress comes by, takes our plates, refills our water, and we wait... and we wait, and wait.. and wait.. to the point where it is now 35 minutes later, now cold out.. and noone has checked on us.. so we make our way inside to the hostess..  We tell her its a bit cold out now, we rather sit inside.. still no problem.. another 10 mins goes by. The hostess comes over and asks if everything is okay. We tell her were still waiting on 3 plates, its been -/+ 40 mins, dont know whats taking so long, cause we got our apps so long ago.. clearly our waiter didn't key in our mains.. we also havent seen her in the last 40 mins.. the hostess, such a nice young lady, goes over to see whats going on..   10 mins later, our pipping hot dishes come out.. apparently the hostess is now our waiter.. since we cant find ours, she's disappeared while in the process of serving us LOL. No big deal, weve experienced worse, food is friggin delicious.   FINALLY, its time for the bill; who brings it to the table, none-other but our ghost waitress. Not even a mention of I am sorry for the delay, her disappearing, not a peep about how the food was, if we enjoyed it (we did btw, alot, kudos to the chef, he's really good), absolutely nothing .. we paid and left. Tipping only the hostess might I add, seeing as how she was the only one who took care of us the entire evening.   SOOOOOOO all in all, food was delicious.. service was horrible.. HOSTESS deserves a raise and we will return with our fingers crossed for a better experience!   3/5"}
{"text":"Went out with a bunch of strangers and came away with a whole group of new acquaintances.  Isn't that what all our \"social\" app-ing is all about?  Not just taking the obligatory photo and waiting for the likes?  I was the last to arrive - no...it wasn't me being fashionably late...it was me trying to figure out how to get into the place.  Seems that the restaurant door is on the north end of the two story barn like structure.  Not where you expect the entrance to be.  When finally walking in, the place is very well appointed and a great place to have a get together.  We had the large dining area with the tables put together in a harvest type table setting.  Lots of familiar faces and now we had a chance to put faces to names to conversations.  Nice - thanks Peter L. for getting this off the ground and Cherrie T. for keeping me in the loop while I was travelling.  I think it was Peter L.'s birthday too - nice....he arranges his own B-D-Party!  Food was less than inspirational.  I had the octopus carpaccio, the braised short rib, and some shots/beers/sangria.  Though the ambiance and service rocked; the food somewhat lacking.  The octopus was hard to find as it was covered in a field salad, and the braised beef short rib was already off the bone and overly salty.  I guess when doing that many drinks and shots, one might not taste the beef that crumbled when cutting.  I would like to say that this would be a great spot those youngsters going on their special dates.  However, for me, it would be a place to have light snacks and drinks with friends or clients.  Cheers."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday evening for a somewhat early dinner (5pm), the restaurant was basically empty when we arrived - so was Main St as a whole (I blame the rain).   I ordered the Nextdoor Burger priced at $16 with set sides - I'm assuming since I wasn't offered a choice. The side included chips that tasted like Lays branded chips IMO and the salad tasted just fine. The burger itself had a thick juicy patty topped with bacon, caramelized onions, and a slice of Swiss cheese I believe. The burger arrived warm and the waitress was very friendly; she often came around to ask us for our thoughts on the food and also refilled our waters promptly.   Overall I had a great experience here, however, the burger tasted mediocre and for the price point....not totally worth it."}
{"text":"Went for dinner Saturday night  Quite disappointed  Air conditioner in bar area not working so it was quite uncomfortable  Service was fantastic. Best part of the evening  Food  Hamburger was very dry and very small. Came with a side of frozen potatoes wedges. Not great at all   All the other meals were just as mediocre  Really not worth the price. Very disappointing as we came here here on mother's day for brunch and everything was fantastic so I recommended this place to our friends. Very mediocre.   The place has so much potential. They just need to pay attention to improving on the food to keep the customers returning. We all live in the vicinity and am not sure we will recommend this place unless there is consistency"}
{"text":"The service was amazing. Me and my friend showed up at the restaurant at around 8 and at the time, the restaurant was completely full. It was full to the point that me and my friend would have to wait an hour for seats inside. This resulted in us having to sit on the patio in 19 degree weather which is pretty cold. The staff went out of their way to bring heaters towards us which is greatly appreciated. They also ensured to check if there were available seats inside from time to time because they knew how cold the weather was. Overall the food tasted pretty good. I had the duck wings and the flat iron steak. Honestly, worth the price. The experience was outstanding."}
