{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Italian place. The staff is so sweet. The owners are amazing people. This is a fabulous family restaurant yet very modern.  If you don't try the canolis you're missing out! I got the eggplant parmesan so awesome. Also, be prepared for LOTS of food! You're going to get a huge platefull no matter what you order. Wonderful, wonderful place. Love you guys!

{"text":"Excellent and affordable authentic NY-style pizza.

The pizza is brooklyn-style, and is excellent. And affordable.
I could recommend this to anyone near I-485 or Cabarrus/Stanly since this is on the way to Charlotte.

This place moved from a small venue in Midland to a larger place closer to I-485, and they have added a nice gameroom and other amenities.

The waitstaff is friendly and the place is clean, esp the bathroom.

They also do a cruise-in night on certain Fridays of the month."}
{"text":"My daughter's favorite place for pizza.  My kids love seeing Miss Jennifer on Friday night to pick up our pizza.  They know us and our order as soon as we call because we eat there so much.  Great family place.  The only reason we don't eat there more often is because they moved to a new location which is a bit farther away but we try to visit as often as possible."}
{"text":"When visiting the area, we picked up a take out pizza. It was a nice option for a quick late dinner. The ordering and pick up process was fine. Though they need to do a better job of getting information out about the new location. We enjoyed the pizza-good medium thickness crust, savory sauce, adequate amount of cheese, and a fair distribution of toppings (bacon, pineapple, onion)."}
{"text":"Why are we cursed in Locust with bad restaurants. I guess we have whomever the moron was that named the town after an Egyptian plague but we can't seem to get anything decent here.
The lady that took my order was rude and judging by her accent was fulfilling the New York stereotype.
All this could have been overlooked if the food was good. But it just wasn't. The pizza was bland and overpriced and the hot wings were the worst I've ever eaten.
Come on Locust, we can do better."}
{"text":"Food is decent. Like any other pizza place. However, most places will tell you what your paying for. This place will catch you by surprise when you get your receipt.  $1 extra to get French fries with a kids meal instead of chips???!!!  Ridiculous.  The waitress suggested french fries when my child ordered, of course he says yes, but didn't inform anyone that there was an extra cost. I know it's only a dollar, but it's my dollar to spend not hers.  That's enough for me, to just stay away."}
{"text":"My mom won a gift card to this place at a Chamber meeting and invited me along to enjoy some pizza with her. Let me tell you how I feel about pizza...growing up, I told my mom that if there was no pizza in heaven, then I don't want to go to heaven. I love a good pizza, and at Pizza and Beyond, I get that. 

They have a very friendly staff, and it is nice quiet place to enjoy some great New York style pizza. If you do not feel like dining in, good news, they deliver!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here in the past and it's always been decent but tonight was a different story. It has been a while since my last visit and the quality of the food and service have really gone down. I've had better pizza from the grocery store freezer and better service there too. The waitress would not being me a salad with olives on the side so I could split it with someone and our Pizza sat on the counter for 2 or 3 minutes waiting to be delivered to our table and they were not busy at all. I wasn't expecting much and this was still a disappointing dinner."}
{"text":"I recently went into Pizza and Beyond, it had been awhile sine I had eaten there. I have always loved their marinara sauce. I don't know if they have changed owners or what,but everything has changed the marinara, the customer service, food,everything but the menu. I ordered what I always order the eggplant rollini. The sauce was runny and tasted nothing like it had before. The waitresses sat and gossiped loudly the entire time we were there. When we were finished I asked for a box for my food and a to go cup for my tea. The box was not a problem, the waitress told me that the owner was no longer doing to go cups because of the expense. I think if I order a $2 glass of tea that costs .25 to make, they have made enough profit off of me to cover the cost of a cup. I will not be going back unless things change back like they were."}
{"text":"Great family place for a reasonable price.  Our daughter always looks forward to Miss Jenn's drawings on her cup.  Great pizza, meatballs, Italian subs, and especially cannoli!"}
