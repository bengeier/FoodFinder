{"text":"Hubby and I ordered delivery from here for the first time last night, a very good decision! The food was excellent - fresh, hot and flavourful - and arrived in 35 minutes at peak supper hour! The cost was well below average. The General Tao Chicken was the best we've ever had, the mushroom fried rice was fluffy and packed with fresh mushroom pieces and the veggie chop suey was fresh and crisp. The chicken balls were huge and stuffed with a lot of chicken;  way, way more than average.  This is our new favourite by a long shot!"}
{"text":"We usually love this place for cheap Chinese food, but we're pretty frustrated that they changed their hours and are no longer open on Sundays (seems like this would be a big day for delivery customers). Worst was that they didn't bother to change hours on their website or Yelp, so after spending time looking at the menu we called to get directed to an automated message."}
{"text":"Terrible! This is the first review I've done because I usually feel places aren't as bad as people say.. I ordered delivery..looking for some Canadian Chinese before heading out drinking on new years eve..I read the reviews on here and thought it seemed really decent. (I've been looking for a new delivery place)The lady on the phone was really nice. It came really quick. I got general tso...waaaay too sweet..not one hint of spice. House fried rice, probably the most decent tasting thing...had very minimal meat...most of it being fatty pieces...like the pieces they would of thrown in the garbage(I got it because it was more expensive than the chicken fried rice so I figured it would be a bit better) Cantonese chow mein....no crispy noodles and the sauce is soooo salty...and again the meat was super fatty and only like 1 shrimp.. Chicken balls because I read a review that said they were the best....no they are not. Over battered and the sweet and sour sauce tasted watered down! And the spring rolls.. not bad but sogy...I'm Irish and turkish and my homemade spring rolls are better. All in all for $50 the portions are not big and the quality is not worth it. I would love a better recommendation for next time!"}
{"text":"I've lived in Toronto for almost 6 years and have somehow managed to never order Chinese food here. Every time I looked for a place, I decided against it for some reason or another. Well, given that tonight is New Year's Eve, I felt I had to order Chinese. Where else to look other than yelp, of course. I came across this place and decided to give it a go. I ordered at 5pm and it was here just before 6, which I think it's great considering NYE. For $50, we got 2 chicken dishes, 1 beef dish, 2 fried rice dishes, and 6 spring roles. And that included tax and (free) delivery. The sweetest, happiest man came to the door to give us our food. Overall, I found it to be tasty and really liked the general tao chicken. I prefer white meat over dark so i was happy to see that most pieces were indeed white meat.

 There's plenty of leftovers, that's for sure. Without a doubt, I would order from here again."}
{"text":"This business does not keep their hours up to date on their website or Yelp. It says they are open on Sundays and one of their reviewers say they received food late at night on a Sunday so they must have changed their hours in the past few months. It's common sense that when you change your hours, you immediately update them everywhere. Nowadays most restaurant's traffic is driven from their online presence and reviews so they are just pissing people off and losing business and face by not keeping it up to date.

Anyways we spent 15 minutes figuring out what we wanted to order, then called in (because you can't order online.. terrible) to hear an automated message saying they're closed Sunday. Even though Yelp and their website both say they are currently open."}
{"text":"This place is a great neighbourhood joint for takeout chinese. I live a block away, so it only makes sense to pick it up - once I ordered from a friend's a little further away and it took 45 minutes. 

The General Tso chicken is great - I've never suspected anything was reheated or not prepared fresh. They're always friendly and if they don't answer the phone the first time when you call, they'll call you right back if your phone number appears. As a regular customer I was happy when they made something for me that wasn't on the menu. I just wish they were open Sundays. It would complete the Oscars experience."}
{"text":"The staff are very friendly

the food is pretty cheap

I LOVE LOVE LOVE the combo take out. they OVERFLOW the container so its enough for 2 people no problem and costs about $10. 

Its good cheap greasy Chinese!  perfect for a hangover!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here before at least 6 other times, the other times have been adequate. A solid 3.5 stars. 

The interior is a wreck though, it has a dusty weird smell that immediately makes you change your order to take out. 

Last night, we ordered the dinner for two $24 after tax meal that comes with chicken wings. Everything was ready in under 5 minutes, which was mildly concerning. Most tasted fine/adequate if a bit reheated.

However, the chicken wings had white feathers deep fried into them. I probably ate a few too before pulling batter off one piece sticking out and seeing the feather underneath, clear as day. Another wing at bottom of the box had non-battered feathers, very obviously white feathers against the brown batter. I don't know how they could miss that when making it in a theoretically well lit kitchen. I've been gagging all night. Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"I'm not a big Chinese food fan, but this place may have changed my mind. It was SO GOOD! We ordered:

Crispy Beef
General Tao Chicken
Honey Garlic Spareribs
Singapore Noodles
Lemon Chicken

It came with 2 soups and 2 egg rolls, plus 2 orders of fried rice. All that for $49 tax-in! Great value and now I have leftovers for a few days at least!

All were excellent, but the standouts were definitely the crispy beef and general tao. Amazing! And huge quantities too. Delivery was quick and easy. 

Would definitely order from here again! Very nice on the phone as well."}
{"text":"We had a delivery order tonight - and every dish was fantastic. General Tso especially recommended."}
{"text":"The place is neighborhood cornerstone awesome food decently priced and the servers are friendly. If u are in the king west neighborhood and have a hankering for chinese I would strongly suggest trying it."}
{"text":"The best chicken balls hands down. The amount of food you receive is astonishing. Crispy beef, won ton soup and spring rolls are all big hits in our house. We've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall place is absolutely fantastic for Chinese take out.  As the previous reviewer said, when you are craving North-Americanized Chinese Food...this place is my personal favourite.  They have the BEST chicken balls.  Price wise, it is also fantastically inexpensive, far cheaper than ordering from one of the large chain places, and the food is far, far better in quality.  They also do a take away lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"Had the Chicken Balls and the Lemon Chicken combo as a take-out. They fill up the container with abundance and the food... yes it is delicious!! Lots of meats and veggies although I would prefer the fried rice over the chop-suey. Not a place you would want to dine in though! Will be back....tomorrow"}
{"text":"Best chinese food that I've had in toronto.  They deliver fast too!  Perfect chicken balls.  The fried rice and chop suey is great.  Portions are large and prices more than reasonable.  This will be my new 'go to' place for chinese.  So glad i discovered it."}
{"text":"Great chinese food!  We had chicken balls, chicken fried rice and the crispy beef.  The chicken balls were huge and very tasty.  Delivery was very quick up to Little Italy too.."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick fix of greasy Chinese food. Their lunch special is the main selling point for me. 

I managed to get a large tray of fried rice with veggies and general tao chicken for just $5. I couldn't believe how generous they were with portioning. The amount of food they serve was enough to cover both Lunch and Dinner!"}
{"text":"Love this place. I always get the crispy beef but never with the broccoli it makes it soggy. The fried rice is great and so the lemon chicken. This place has been there for at least 15 years and counting. Great food and great delivery. 

It has eat in but it nothing special. It's more of a take out place or delivery. Not bad for the price and they have a large delivery zone. That's the real deal on this place."}
{"text":"Favourite Chinese place in Toronto. SS pork, chicken fried rice, chicken balls, chow mein. The classics done right. 

The thick kind of sweet and sour sauce, great price point. Very similar to New Hong Kong in Whitby. What I've been looking for in Toronto for years."}
{"text":"I am a fan, this place was GOOOOOOD!
I got chicken balls (amazing) / general tao's chicken (which was also amazing) beef with black bean sauce on rice noodles (it was ok) 
The food was much better than I thought it was going to be. I went safe with my order because I haven't eaten here before but it was all great! 
I would most definitely be going here again!
I'd like to recommend the chicken balls and the general tao's chicken."}
{"text":"Gotten takeout from this restaurant for a party. We ordered 3 main dishes and they all tasted horrible. The noodles we got smelled funky and rancid when we opened the takeout container.

The fried rice was dry like sand. It seemed they have just reheated and packed it up for the customer.

The noodles smelled awful. We threw out the entire container. 

This restaurant has probably the worst Chinese food I've had in my life. Definitely will not be coming back again!"}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would. I Ritual ordered spicy Thai noodles with chicken and shrimp and shrimp fried rice and added two spring rolls as dinner for my roommate and I. This has to be hands down the worst food I've ever picked up in the city in my 5 years here. The only saving grace is the fact that I used the ritual offer for the King St pilot project so this disappointment only cost me around $9. The spring rolls lacked any flavour or filling. The spicy Thai noodles were not at all spicy and were quite dry with a ketchup kind of taste. The packets of chili sauce they gave us made this dish at least edible until we got some weird pieces of chicken and picked out all the meat. Shrimp was non existent in this \"chicken and shrimp\" dish but it's probably just as well. The shrimp fried rice was pretty bland and not at all well cooked. There were tons and tons of shrimp in the dish which would have been great normally. The shrimp in this dish however were a weird transparent colour and they had an odd floor cleaner chemical taste which completely ruined my appetite. There are enough leftovers for lunch for both of us, but we've picked out all the meat as we don't like wasting food. At this point I'm not even sure I can even bring myself to touch the leftovers. I'm thoroughly grossed out by this whole experience. The hypochondriac in me is afraid that food poisoning is in my near future."}
{"text":"Had food delivered from here on a rainy Sunday night. I yelped for a close by resto that delivers and this was #1. I was hesitant as I'm not a resident of the area but I put my fate in yelp and ordered. 

We got the special fried to rice which included shrimp, chicken, beef and pork. Pepper shrimp (lightly coated and fried with peppers and onions and chillies). also because all the reviews raved about the chicken balls, I wanted to try it 

The fried rice was good. Lots of meat. Like everyone said, it wasn't greasy and I had the leftovers for lunch today and it was still good. 

The pepper shrimp was amazing. We always get this from West Indian Chinese places and this was really good in comparison, even my bf was impressed. \"Good call\" he said. Oh and they portions was huge! 

The chicken balls was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The chicken was tender and it was white meat used. It's a little dry on its own without the sauce but yeah it would be, it's chicken and bread, of course it needs sauce!! 

This was a really good meal. Everything i read about in reviews was consistent with our meal. For a busy rainy day, it got there in 40 mins. The total without tip was $29. And there was lots of leftovers for us. (Im having chicken balls for lunch tomorrow!)"}
{"text":"Terrible meals.  Decent wonton soup. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Great tasting food, but you better put your dinner order in at lunchtime because the delivery at this place takes longer than the second coming of Christ. 

I must be retarded because I keep going back to this place thinking maybe next time they will be quicker, but they continue to keep me waiting."}
{"text":"A chinese restaurant that do not have egg rolls.
Should say alot..they have a steam table where you pay per item..the won ton is good if salty..place really needs a cleaning and a repaint..
Not as good as it was .gone downhill since the daughters took it over as they just don't seem to know what their doing"}
{"text":"A lot of food, A LOT OF FOOD at an excellent price. And they deliver, so you don't even have to go out. My new favorite Chinese place!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. Good in a pinch. Too much MSG. The chicken chop suey is great!"}
{"text":"We switched back to Bamboo Buddha because they're pretty much the best overall delivery place close to us--but that's not saying much. They have discontinued their daily rotating specials for cash orders offering only free spring rolls and despite having egg rolls on the menu, they never have them. 

Portions are still generous, though and it's good value for money if you're feeling too lazy to cook."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here the other night. An hour and a half after placing my order I called the restaurant to see if my food was on the way, they told me the driver just left and will be there in less than 10 minutes. I waited for another 45 minutes. No delivery. I promptly called the restaurant and told them to forget about it. This was on a Wednesday evening by the way."}
{"text":"I really hate writing this, particularly after my previous glowing review, but the last two times I've eaten here has been bad.  Really bad.  Gamey chicken, questionable, tough beef, and my poor dear husband becoming sick, sick, sick.
I wouldn't have updated it after one bad fluke experience, but I'm sensing a trend..."}
{"text":"The chicken balls are huge and all chicken! I was shocked because chicken balls are usually all bater. Huge portions. Great delivery service, they got to me in 20mins in rush hour damn! Most definitely my go to delivery."}
{"text":"BAD! BAD!! BAD!!!

I read reviews on Yelp recommending this but I was beyond disappointed.

I ordered the House Special Spicy. (Beef, Pork, Chicken and Shrimp Fried Rice) with Breaded Shrimp and Spring Rolls, they all tasted horrible and it wasn't cheap.

I should have ordered from my regular spot with fast delivery and very good tasty food (New Ho King)

Also, they delivered my food late. Never ordering from here again. NEVER EVER!"}
{"text":"Average neighbourhood Chinese joint. Quick take-out, and friendly but curt service. I've been getting takeout here for over 5 years, and the quality has stayed the same. My two favourite choices are the fried squid appetizer and the curried vermicelli noodles. A good choice for takeout on a cold night when you don't want to go too far."}
{"text":"Very Good value, and Excellent, Freshly Made Chinese food. I stay in Liberty Village when I visit and walk to the Bamboo Buddha. I love the fresh crisp bean sprouts and celery in their Chicken Shop Suey! The woman that works there with her cook husband has her kids work the register. They do good business with takeout, so keep that in mind if you go there on a busy Weekend night. Highly recommended! 

Great to order and take out for Netflix and chill!
and by \"chill\"...I mean have sex...."}
{"text":"i love the chicen balls here, best in the city,the rest of the menu is pretty good too, but make sure you try the chicken balls"}
{"text":"My very favourite Chinese food in Toronto. When you're looking for your classic Canadian/Chinese take out - this is where you want to go. Fast, fresh, tasty and more than generous portions.   Excellent noodles of any kind and chicken of any kind. Vegetables never overlooked."}
{"text":"Considering the sheer number of Chinese people in the city, Chinese delivery is a surprisingly disappointing thing in downtown TO, especially if you're looking for both good and cheap at the same time.

Bamboo Buddha is a prime example.  Pricewise, they are great, however the food itself is hit or miss.

Guiltily, I must confess that I order from here whenever I want the cheap kind of Chinese takeout, aka, stuff that really isn't true Chinese food at all.  Think fortune cookies, and bright red sweet and sour sauce on stuff covered in fried batter.

On that count, they're pretty reliable - best chicken balls I think I've eaten in the city (as I type this, I do realize I am talking as if chicken balls are a food worthy of review and am sufficiently embarrassed).  I like the fact that they also offer egg rolls in addition to spring rolls - somewhere along the line, food snobs like me almost drove them into extinction.

Fried rice and chow mein noodles are no better than okay, and they suffer from the too many veggies (let's face it, a decision for takeout Chinese is usually not made on the basis of, \"I want something healthy\"), and said veggies are cut too big (in the case of mushrooms, not at all), and sometimes taste kind of bitter.

Edible, satisfies cravings cheaply, but you won't want it again for a while."}
{"text":"Bamboo Buddha is pretty awesome. Goodbye Taste of China for my honorary chinese go to, you've been replaced for the next while. 

I've ordered from them through delivery so I don't know how the restaurant looks inside. The only problem I've had with Bamboo Buddha was the delivery waiting time, it's about a 5-7 min drive away from me and it took them over an hour and 45 minutes to come(otherwise I would've given it 5 stars!)

Order: 
 
2 Spring Rolls @ $1.25 each ( standard spring roll you can find at all chinese restos ) 

Cantonese Chow Mein @ $10.50 (tasty noodle dish and make sure to specify what type of add on you want -chicken, vegetable, beef etc because they don't ask - otherwise you will just get a mixture) 

Hot & Spicy Shrimp @ $10.95 ( it wasn't spicy at all, ask for extra spice to be added and it tastes exactly like kung pao shrimp, not that there's anything wrong with that) 

The total came around the mid twenty dollar range, I wasn't charged a delivery fee which was nice. Portions are standard asian take out size, perfect for sharing it's deliciousness."}
{"text":"Quick delivery. Decent tasting food.
Got the beef in black bean sauce, chicken fried rice and spicy shrimp. Fulfilled my grease cravings! This review is just as 'meh' as the food was. It's almost that you gotta be tipsy in order to fully enjoy this type of meal :)"}
{"text":"My favourite good/bad Chinese food in the Queen West area. Their chicken balls are the best i've ever had. My typical order is BBQ Pork Fried Rice, Chicken Balls, and 1 random dish.

I'd have to say their General Tso's is some of the best I've ever had. Their Beef and Broccoli is rather standard, but certainly not bad. Portion sizes are immense and delivery is as speedy as expected.

If you're looking for good takeout Chinese food then I'd recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"So. So. So. Slow. And my least favourite kind of slow, where you say how long? 20-25 mins! But you said my order would be ready NOW. Ok, how about 5-10 mins? You just said 25, now it might be 5? Which is it??! 

I ordered Ritual from here, which I think makes it worse. Ritual is supposed to be better than takeout, they tell you exactly when to show up, you show up, the restaurant puts the bag in your hand, you go on your merry way. No such luck with Bamboo Buddha. 

Beyond the total crap incomprehensible service, this is full on chinese food for white people. Ugh. The things that are edible - spring rolls, general Tso chicken, crispy beef - are all deep fried, with the \"meats\" being basically all batter. Kids love it - but I expect actual substance in my protein dishes. Noodle dishes here are not edible, the chow mein has weird pale chicken in it, like whiter than white yet somehow still grey pale. Was it boiled? Microwaved? I don't know, but I definitely didn't eat it. Ick. 2 stars if you only order fried things and don't care if you wait forever."}
{"text":"When you move from the suburbs where there's old school \"Chinese and Canadian\" places everywhere into just south of Chinatown, it's surprisingly difficult to find just the basic old fashioned Chinese you grew up on before you had any idea of culture. Bamboo Buddha has it all in hand though - it was a great value on good Chinese food like I grew up on. It's our go to now."}
{"text":"I know that Chinatown is a mere 15 minute walk from my place where I could get authentic Chinese food.  There's tons of eateries in there that I know I can walk into and be the only white guy in the place.  That's totally fine.  I love going to the places and getting as close-to-authentic Chinese food that you can get over here.  But there are times when I just want to get down and dirty with some North-Americanized food.  Bring on the chicken balls, the fried rice, and the things that your parents order when they pick up the phone.

Bamboo Buddha actually provides some of both worlds here.  They give the typical North Americanized fare that you'd expect, but also throw in some new menu items that I'm sure would be tame by Chinatown standards but are completely new to small-towners ordering in.  It's a small family-owned business that turns out good food quickly, so it keeps you from having to go to the likes of Ho-Lee-Chow (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/ho-lee-chow-york) or similar ilk, if that helps as well."}
{"text":"On the advice of a fellow Yelper, I took a walk over to this neighborhood Chinese take out. Being in the Trinity Bellwoods area there's not a lot to choose from Chinese food wise, so thought I'd take my chances on this place. I ordered the Chicken Almond Soo Guy, Sweet and Sour Chicken Balls, and Chicken Fried Rice, plus two egg rolls. As far as food quality goes, I give it a 7/10. Good quality Chinese food and in the neighborhood. It is a bit on the greasy side, and the smoke hovering will take away any atmosphere you were hoping for, but it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"This place is decent for what you pay for. It's obviously not authentic Chinese food but they give you a pretty big portion for a reasonably low price. I got 2 items in a large take out box for $4. The food is basically like a cheaper version of Manchu Wok, greasy goodness! The food there is a hit and miss sometimes though. Last time I got lunch, my fried rice was burnt but the chicken was good!"}
{"text":"I got takeout and it was quick and pleasant. The portion was generous and the squid was super tasty."}
{"text":"Either they're cheapening out on the meat or they are vegetarians and are trying to convert you because when you eat fried meat dish, 2/3 of what you're eating is batter.
Stick to vegetarian dish if you don't want to fill up on fried batter. Personally, I'd get a donut instead."}
{"text":"I love this place for take out. One of the combo meals is enough for two people with decent appetites and the price can't be beat! It's made fresh and always tasty. A great go to place for cheap and dirty North American style Chinese food."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery a couple of days ago and the wait time wasn't too bad for a Sunday evening.

I got the Yang Chow fried rice, Orange Chicken, and Crispy Beef. The fried rice was excellent and had an appropriate amount of meat (decent for the price). The Crispy beef was ok but the Orange Chicken definitely outshined it. It had just the right amount of batter and was mildly sweet (just right).

Some small issues:

- I drained some of sauce from both meat dishes because it wasn't thick enough. I didn't want the leftovers to get soggy by the next day.
- It seemed like there was a bit too much Broccoli added.

Overall, it was a good experience so I will definitely be ordering again."}
{"text":"Off the charts broccoli in garlic sauce. Probably will be featured in some list on the year 2019's hot new trend: broccoli. 

I love broccoli. 

This place delivers, and nails the classic Canadian comforts of city Chinese delivery."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre at best. I ordered the crispy beef, general tao chicken and sweet and sour chicken balls. The crispy beef was not crispy at all and very breaded and did not taste much different than the general tao chicken which is also nothing spectacular. The chicken balls were mostly bread with small bits of chicken. Definitely will not be returning"}
{"text":"The fried rice alone deserves 5 stars. Its certainly not authentic but it is really flavourful. From Broccoli Beef to Ma Po Tofu everything at Bamboo Buddha is extremely tasty. And cheap, my god this place is cheap. My favorite part is the service. Love the Mum & Pop who run this place, so cheeky and friendly. A lovely little local that also delivers."}
{"text":"Quick delivery and great food! Definite must try. The crispy chicken balls were perfect!!"}
{"text":"VERY slow service - if you're crunched for time, this is not the place to go for either takeouts or dine-in. i waited 30mins for a take out order of mushroom fried rice and lemongrass chicken.

this is a family-owned business so they have their daughters working the front a d they were friendly and efficient

the portions are very big. i really enjoyed the mushroom fried rice - big mushroom pieces and really tasty. the lemongrass chicken was disappointing - no lemongrass flavour, it was more sweet and sour flavour

i'd give this place another try cuz i heard their chicken balls are the bomb."}
{"text":"At first I thought this is a hole in wall kinda place. But the food was so disappointing. I ordered only two dishes (kungpo shrimp and mapo tofu) and even the rice was not well cooked.... It wasn't the best Chinese food let me begin with this.
It turns out to be more like a neighbourhood, quick grab and go takeaway Chinese food. If you want something to just fill up your stomach, not caring if it's good or not, then you can order takeout from this place. 
They also pre deep fry the chicken balls, spring rolls and shrimp. Which means they double deep fry it again. But the waitresses and people here is very efficient. They clean fast, takes your order quick, and cooks it quick too. Still....don't think I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"At par with food court grade Chinese food. Don't expect much and take-out or request delivery. Food is savoury, salty or extremely sweet and tangy. 

It's a pretty depressing place.

I sat there for an hour once and had some pretty depressing thoughts. I blame the setting. I'm being serious. 

Excellent choice on those days when you're broke and really don't want to eat at home."}
{"text":"Pretty good place! It's a great place to go to without gong to china town. The reviews on the chicken balls were right.. They're huge!! Barely any batter and nothing was greasy.. Def coming back"}
{"text":"Back on top! Bamboo Buddha went under new management a few months back and the quality wavered. Tonight we tried it again and it was delicious! It seems they have worked out the kinks and are back to being the best Chinese delivery around! 
Chicken balls and General Tao are A+"}
{"text":"Yummmmm!!!! Big meaty chicken balls , and crispy too :)) happy dance ... I would order from them again. And they deliver:)"}
{"text":"I watched a documentary called The Search for General TSO's Chicken, which was fantastic. And it made me wanting this dish.

I've never liked downtown Chinese food, it's very \"westernized\" -nothing authentic, obviously, what do I expect right? Seeing dishes like \"pineapple chicken\" would annoy me.

The documentary helped me appreciate the Chinese restaurants here in North America, I apologize for not seeing them this way until now. So I looked for Chinese food that night and landed here! Takeout was super fast, 5 minutes tops for a \"meal for one for $8.95\"

- egg roll + sweet and sour sauce (a container as large as takeout miso soup. I don't need THIS much for ONE egg roll)
- chicken fried rice
- broccoli
- general tso's chicken, or other choices (I think there's stuff like cripsy beef, orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken)

The food was satisfactory downtown Chinese. It's good!!!! really! Service is great. I had a lot leftover for next day's breakfast and lunch. Basically 2.5 meals for under $10. It was really saucy, the General TSO's Chicken was too sweet for me. The fried rice was okay, it was sweeter than I'm used to.

Uhhhhh

for the rest of you that are like me, if you don't crave this kind of \"Chinese\" don't come here. But out of all takeout Chinese food I've had downtown, this restaurant is easily top 3.

and for a cheap, stay-in, pizza, movie kind of night, this is satisfying food :)

oops** this restaurant calls it General TAO's Chicken"}
