{"text":"My family has been dinning at Vito's for about 30 years. We have celebrated many Birthdays as well as other special events. With 3 generation of loyal Vito's fans, it saddens me to write this review. In the past year I have had such bad pizza from Vito's. That I have said I would never eat there again! Because the pizza had changed, it wasn't Vito's old pizza! I love it!  Then my sister convinced me to try it one more time. I had a good experience. The pizza was a little better. So I tried it again last week, it was good but still not \"Vito's\".  So tonight I thought I would give it another chance. They changed the crust What The Heck! Vito had a great pizza! If its NOT broken DON'T fix it! Now I don't think I will try it again. The quality is just not worth the price of the pizza any more. 

Sadly,

{"text":"Visiting srea.  Used Yelp to find this place.  It is a great Italian restaurant.  Good foid.  Good service. Nice experience."}
{"text":"These guys are awesome! The food is seriously top notch... all the pastas, salads, and pizza that I have tried have been great. I work nearby so I am in there a lot :) Doesn't get any better than Bob and Vito either! Definitely would recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Vito's for years and years. When I was 12 I \"apprenticed\" for the artists who painted the wall murals throughout the restaurant. I wish someone would revamp the menu a bit. The bread basket (with herb butter) is really good, the meatballs are good (though I don't eat a lot of meat) the pizza is INCREDIBLE, but everything else needs some work. Don't eat the salmon... Always tastes somewhat fishy. Great service, nice little family place."}
{"text":"If I could, I would give this restaurant a zero star review. We had a vegetarian at our table, and their veggie meal was served with a small piece of hamburger mixed in with his pasta. We sent it back and no one came to apologize. As for the rest of our meals, the chef mist have dropped a box of salt in our chicken picatta. I will not return here again."}
{"text":"Less than stellar- Came in on a Sunday night at 7:30.  Place was half empty but they thought it would be good to put us by the kitchen door that was noisy.  We asked to be seated elsewhere.  We were told that the tables were all reserved.  Flat out lied!!!!  When asked a second time she said it again!!!!  Food was overpriced for what u got.  Average taste. Won't be going there again.  Normally would  try them again but not after the lying and snippy attitude of the young gal who sat us."}
{"text":"Garbage total rip off of Uncle Sal's in south Scottsdale.  Gave it a try for take-out the other night.  Was charged $44.47 for a 16\" and 14\" undercooked pizza's.  Not going back to even try the full restaurants."}
{"text":"I called and ordered a pizza and salad from here last night to be delivered. First of all, when I called the girl didn't know which pizza I was referring to, the \"works\" as it was referred to online. After trying to explain the name of the pizza multiple times I told her forget it and give the the supreme instead with a small Italian salad. Pizza was delivered after an hour and was cold, soggy, and all smashed to one side of the pizza box. The salad I ordered was not an Italian salad but a plain side salad with ranch dressing, to which I found A HAIR in the ranch. Needless to say I've never had such bad food for $30. Never going back"}
{"text":"Amazing food, Awesome service! This was our first visit, We tried the deluxe pizza sooo delicious. Wednesday night is half priced deserts, We couldn't decide on one so we shared the Strawberry cheese cake and cannoli both were yummy! Debra was our waitress she was very friendly and helpful. We will be back! If you haven't tried Vito's we recommend it."}
{"text":"Love love this place! Great for my gluten free needs and super friendly. Arrabiata sauce on pasta a la Vito's is delish! Baked wings r yummy and the blackened salmon salad is great! GF pizza as well is pretty good. Oh and for non-gf the pizza is very good and lasagna too. Win!"}
{"text":"My mother, my wife and I all said that we had one of the best meals ever here. This was great quality for the price. Highly recommend specialty dishes. Haven't had the pizza which it seemed like most people around us ordered."}
{"text":"I'm pretty familiar with Vito's...some co-workers and I would pick up lunch a couple times a month here and I've also dined at the restaurant. The parking area is cramped, but the outside of the restaurant and the patio area is aesthetically pleasing. Based on my experiences, the food is great, but most (not all!) of the wait staff leave something to be desired. 

My husband and I recently had our date night here and we weren't impressed with our server. She was super fake friendly with a sickly-sweet smile plastered across her face. Personally, I don't need a server to be overly friendly...fake or not. Just being polite, efficient, and being a good communicator earn big points with me. I've been a server and I know that it can be tough, but she actually did some sort of weird eye-roll when I asked for our dessert to go! Maybe she had something in her eye or had a seizure?

The Baked Ziti is crazy good and is my go-to dish. Similarly, the Fried Zucchini is to die for. I also enjoy the Italian sodas. I tried the Chicken Cacciatore once and almost vomited. I much prefer Buca di Beppo's. My husband said his Chicken Fettucini Alfredo was really bland. 

The #1 reason to go here?......the Pumpkin Crunch dessert! OMG!
It is unbelievably delicious! My husband had a look of ecstasy on his face while eating it, lol. That's saying a lot because he can be really picky about his food. Keep in mind that the Pumpkin Crunch is seasonal, so it's only available for a couple months."}
{"text":"Vito's is great.  WE have gone there a number of times and have never been disappointed.  We went before I went gluten free and the pasta with sunrise sauce is great.  Now gluten free and they have gluten free pasta and pizza!!  They made me a special order baked gluten free ziti--loaded with cheese and so good!  Salads are great and so is service.  Highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza but service has gone downhill recently.  Has always been a very authentic Italian restaurant with a warm atmosphere... Servers no longer seem to enjoy what they do."}
{"text":"Used to go here all the time and noticed food was changing. So we changed to another Italian local place down the road. We decided to give them a try again about a month ago and try our old favorite dishes. I was still very disappointed the chicken with my pasta changed and had a familiar chicken from Box taste and seasoning on chicken was not the same and very little spice as this was a spicy pasta dish and was lacking cheese. Hoping they change back to original chicken."}
{"text":"Group of 8 friends visited for the first time for Happy Hour. Plan to go back for dinner with our husbands some time despite the long drive from Cave Creek.  Will definitely put Vito's on our regular happy hour list.

The Happy Hour appetizer menu was good.  Everyone enjoyed what they ordered.  Favorites were crispy asparagus, apple and brie bruschetta, and the specials.  Good value and taste in everything we tried.

The main reason I had to write a review was because of the excellent server who seamlessly navigated a packed-to-the-rafters happy hour crowd with professionalism, friendliness, proficiency, charm and grace.  Adam is certainly an asset to the establishment and I hope management fully appreciates his contribution.  I always appreciate competent  servers, but Adam was exceptional. Had I not been long retired, I would have tried to hire him away. His team of helpers were good too.  

The decor and atmosphere is good.  Wonderful variety of tile work.  Many great pendent lamps.  Would like to try  the outdoor seating one of these days."}
{"text":"Went here with my wife, kids, and mother in law.. we were seated in the darkest corner in the back of the restaurant. We ordered our food and was assured that we were getting bread with our meals.. 20 mins later we receive our food, and after the waitress left we noticed no bread.. waitress didn't come back for at least 15 mins, we then asked for the bread that we were told we were getting... next thing ya know it we get our bread. This bread was given to us fridge cold.. so much for warm bread. This being the first time at this restaurant, I was not impressed and certainly will not be going back here"}
{"text":"Mediocre Italian food at best. Got my credit card frauded after dining here."}
{"text":"I was looking for restaurants that delivered so I called up. I was pleasantly greeted and given amazing customer service. I asked for some advice on what was good and was given amazing choices. All around awesome food and service!"}
{"text":"You can always tell a good cup of coffee without all the bells and whistles; smooth, not bitter, no aftertaste... I felt this way about the red sauce I had here (with bread) last Sunday night. Honestly, I didn't need the bread! If the sauce is good, you know the rest is dynamite! I'm a foodie and a sauce expert. This is why I used the coffee comparison because anyone can add sugar and cream to the beans! Said sauce had great wholesome texture, not too sweet, and you could tell it hadn't been sitting in the pot for long. Coming back for sure! Nice, friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Best Italian food I've had west of the Mississippi.   Risotto exceptional... pizza very very good"}
{"text":"I've eaten at both Vito's Mesa location and at this one and I'd say the product between the two is comparable.  The pizza here is on the pricey side and never feels like a great value.  It's decent food and better than edible, but it's not really something I end up going out of my way to order.

The texture of the crust never fees quite right to me, almost too spongy, and overall pizzas lack flavor.

Perhaps the other offerings on the menu are better, but to this point I've just had the pizza which is passable but not great."}
{"text":"This food is not very good. I live in east Mesa and never liked this place. It's always busy and the restaurant is very dirty. Defiantly not a nice place to enjoy dinner. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is a joke.  You can get Salmon ENTREE for $14 that is the size of a snickers bar with nothing on the side or you can order an appetizer of steak, onion strings and mashed potatoes for $14 that would satisfy your appetite only a little.  Pretzels came with cheese spilled ALL over and hostesses were extremely rude.  I would recommend anything but Vito's....what a rip off for horrible food and snotty employees."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite date night destinations. Pizza has an amazing thin crust. My wife loves the lobster ravioli with sunrise sauce. Service is always perfect. This is a place we always bring out of town friends."}
{"text":"Great place to eat Italian. Mesa needs more Indy restaurants like this."}
{"text":"Went late afternoon to Vito's on Frank Lloyd Wright and were given two menus, one regular and one Early Bird Special menu. When giving our order to the waitress we all ordered off the Early Bird menu, one even pointing to the item on the Earl Bird menu. One of the pasta dishes had meat sauce which tasted burnt and the other small portion of sausage and peppers pasta in their \"New\" big dish (which was a bowl with a 3\" rim) was supposed to be marinara sauce, but looked and tasted like pasta in soup, very watery. We did not complain about the dishes but went ahead with our dinner.  When the bill came we all were billed off the regular menu. We brought this incorrect bill to the attention of the waitress and said she would see what could be done.  She came back and said she miss understood our order and the lady manager said that was the bill, even though we questioned the size of the portions which were most sure-idly small. We give the manager an \"F\" for failing to correct the bill and the waitress a \"D\" for dumb. We will not go back or recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"Should have gone to Spinatos Pizza across the street where I've never had a bad experience. Service in this place was terrible. My one and only beer glass was empty along with my water glass during my entire meal. I mentioned it to the front desk on the way out and she said sorry that's been a problem lately. I paused thinking they might get the manager or offer something.....Nothing else was said. I told her I won't be back. Guess I can't compare to 15 years ago with Original Vitos in Mesa."}
{"text":"We went here last night, overall it was ok. To start, our waitress had the quietest voice and with a screaming baby next to us, she was difficult to hear. We had the traditional bruschetta and the meat stuffed mushrooms. Both were ok, I've never had bruschetta with feta cheese before (not something I'd recommend). My husband ordered the fettuccini Alfredo with jumbo shrimp. His meal was delicious and the jumbo shrimp were actually jumbo sized! I ordered one of the chefs specialities, blackened chicken on risotto with sautéed spinach. The chicken was delicious (probably the only good thing on my plate). The risotto was bland and under-cooked, so the rice was almost slightly crunchy. The sautéed spinach was so bland, even some salt and pepper would elevate it. Would not order that again. The other annoying part of our meal is that once our food was served we never saw our waitress again. We all had empty drinks and had to flag down another server to bring us refills. It was not busy while we were there so I don't understand the sub-par service. Overall, I wouldn't return here."}
{"text":"We had an event catered by Vito's. We had 6 different dishes. They all met our expectations and then some. The server was very attentive and cordial. The meatballs are large, you can figure 1 per person. Alfredo was creamy and full of flavor. Parmesan risotto was a big hit. We also had the sauteed veggies, sausage and peppers, ziti. Every dish was great. I would use them again and also stop in for a meal."}
{"text":"Food was delicious,  but this place is slower than rush hour! Not hovering is nice but this was extreme."}
{"text":"Love coming here. It is family owned with a tradition of excellence. My favorite are the seafood tortellini and a customized calzone with sunrise sauce, chicken, and extra mozzarella cheese on the inside, sunrise sauce on top with extra sunrise sauce on the side. This is a great Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Pizza the real deal here. I dont mess with all the fancy Italian dishes. Probably good, but how can you pas on the pizza? Authentic Chicago style thin crust. Get the meat lovers, you cant go wrong.   Never disappointed."}
{"text":"painful review for a painful experience.

I've been here only once, I decided to take the GF out to somewhere very Tuscan/ Traditional/ Vintage Italian with a cute atmosphere.
Through neighborhood talk I had heard about Vito's being a touch pricey but worth every penny for their pasta and more importantly their pizza.

So we went, her being a seasoned Vito's vet. and myself a first timer , I had high hopes at first seeing a full parking lot and an even more bustling inside, we were immediately seated.. in the corner, in fact from what I could see to be the only corner in the whole place that is void of all attention.

After sitting down for ~15 minutes we were waited on by a nice waitress with a fully plastered smile (insincerity was the dress code I guess), I ordered some small pasta dish, the same for my GF. Roughly 20 minutes later I was served what appeared to be the most expensive and completely cold ravioli dish to ever make my acquaintance, time passed and passed and the waitress never returned not until it was time to ask about dessert's.
By this point I just wanted to eat something, and to fulfill my promise to her parents of bringing back an Italian dessert; I ordered 2 desserts to go and we jetted out of there.

Of course not before shelling out something like $50.00 AFTER using a gift certificate her parents had entrusted to us.
I had extremely high hopes for Vito's considering the kind words I had been told about it, and I do realize mistakes can and do happen but it will be a cold July here in Arizona before I return to Vito's."}
{"text":"Such a great spot. Outstanding food with that local feel and the excellent staff make you feel like family."}
{"text":"Recently went to Vito's for comedy night. The food was good, as always. It was a pretty fun night, but some of the comedians were \"R rated\". So fair warning to those of you who might want to go to one of these comedy nights. 
It was unfortunate that the instructors of the comedy school did not tell their students that they should know their audience. This is east Mesa with a lot of 55 and older people and typically a conservative community. Some of the jokes were offensive and you could tell by the expressions on the faces of the audience that the jokes were not appropriate for this audience. I hope the owners and managers at the restaurant will pass this on to the comedy school. (The 4 stars are more for the restaurant than the comedy show- although about half of the comedians were good and the featured comedian was very good)."}
{"text":"Decided to try their delivery service. Food was just as good as it was in the restaurant. We had the buffalo chicken pizza, delicious! 

Forget pizza hut, dominoes, and papa johns..... VITOS is where you can get fresh YUMMY pizza delivered to you in the comfort of your home. Just remember to tip well, its worth it!"}
{"text":"I can't recall when we enjoyed a meal less. while the service was fine, the food was yuckie. The soup was so peppery and overspiced as to be inedible. The  lasagna was drowned in a thick red meat sauce that was crude and overwhelmed the pasta and ricotta of the block of  unevenly reheated pasta, which was sitting for hours and nuked. The other entrees were  no more edible than the lasagna.  All in all an expensive crappy meal I'll never repeat."}
{"text":"If you are looking for some delicious Chicago thin crust pizza in the Valley, Vito's is the place you need to be. I always get the Calamari and the Deluxe pizza, which I highly recommend."}
{"text":"garlic bread was good the lasagna was the worst i have ever eaten over priced for the terrible food you get"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends who had been here before and had good experiences. The staff was very friendly and accommodating, however that was overshadowed by the wait for our food which took about 40 minutes to get our entrees from the time we ordered. Would have been okay if my food was good, but it was fair at best.  I ordered the veal marsala and it showed up lukewarm and the sauce was overly sweet and resembled gravy out of the jar. My wife got a pizza and said it had just average flavor. I might try this place again to give it another shot, but will probably be a while."}
{"text":"Food and service is consistently divine here. I drive all the way from central Phoenix just to indulge in the pleasant atmosphere, courtesy staff, and tasteful dishes. A rare gem here in Mesa."}
{"text":"Good food and portions.... will be going back monthly... Calamari is Awesome.."}
{"text":"This is a borderline Upscale Italian Eatery ........
The interior decor is outstanding .........
Thankfully, its not trying to be the priciest ...... yet !!

Its been open for about one month .....
Located in a building, that has seen many restaurants, come and go ....... 
I predict, that Vito's will be a huge success ........
IF ...  they're wise enough, to avoid being on the edge of being overly expensive.....

The food and service, were outstanding this evening ......
They have Specials on various Weekday Nights, checkout their website, to see whats what ......

{"text":"We went here for the first time on Tuesday and fell in love. If you order one entree on Tuesdays you get two glasses of wine $1 each. Who can beat that? We ordered the veal parmigiana and it was delicious. Great atmosphere and attentive service. This will be our new go to spot! The only thing was the hostess with the long blonde hair wasn't very nice when we entered or left. As a past hostess at a restaurant first impressions mean everything but our server was very friendly and made us feel welcome."}
{"text":"My husband and his family have been going to Vito's since he was a kid. Just recently he decided to take our family here for dinner. The place is old, but very cute with a lot of character. We were seated fairly quickly, and the server promptly greeted us and got our drinks quickly. 

We had a party of 8, 4 adults and 4 kids. We ordered the calamari for an appetizer with marinara to dip in. It was a little greasy, but overall very tender and good. We eat a lot of calamari when we can get fresh squid, and this was up there. For dinner we ordered 2 large pizzas and my husband got the seafood lasagna. The kids got spaghetti and pepperoni pizza. 

I was impressed with the kids meals. The pasta was plentiful and a meatball was in a bowl of sauce on the side. It was fun for them to mix the sauce into the noodles. The kids pizza was dinner plate sized and filled up my 10 year old. 

Our pizzas were decent sized and ok. With all the hype I have heard about this place for the last 15 years, maybe my expectations were too high. It was good thin crust pizza, don't get me wrong, but it wasn't \"to die for amazing\" I like Oregano's about the same as this. My husband's seafood lasagna was very good. It had a lot of seafood in it with a tomato cream sauce. I was disappointed to see that there was no bread basket or anything, but again, it was good and something quite unique.

Overall for my this place was good, but really expensive! For the price, I was expecting a LOT more in flavor and originality. Will I go back? Probably. But we won't be back often and we will probably go without kids as a $60 plus dinner bill for 2 people seems about what we would pay."}
{"text":"The pizza is horrible. Allow me to explain. My wife and I ordered a pizza to go so this review is merely on the pizza alone, seeing how were not able to experience the dinning in experience. With that said my wife and I love thin crust pizza and Vito's claim to have the best thin crust we decided to give them a shot. Long story short, the pizza is nasty and definitely NOT thin crust. Not even sure what you would call that pizza. We will not be returning for the pizza. Considering the other positive reviews we may experience some other food there."}
{"text":"By far the best damn food west of the Mississippi. Just like my grandmother cook. Outstanding!!"}
{"text":"The worst Pizza I've ever had! The crust tasted store bought, the sauce was flavorless and nothing tasted like authentic Italian. We went this afternoon and we will never return. Couldn't taste garlic, basil, or any spices in anything we had! Don't waste your money there are so many delicious Italian spots in town and this place is sure to disappoint."}
{"text":"Lori and Alyssa are the best bartenders around! They remember what you had to drink after just one visit and provide excellent cheerful service.  The food is good too,  but we come to Vitos for them!"}
{"text":"So we get a $20 Groupon... great!  We arrive and discover it happens to be half off specialty drink night... sweet!  My boyfriend orders a margarita and I get a sangria, in addition to $50 worth of full priced entrees.  Food is mediocre at best.  Way too expensive for food that tastes like it was frozen and then heated up under a lamp for 45 minutes waiting for someone to order it. 

The bill finally arrives and we present the $20 Groupon credit.  The waitress frowns and says we can't use it.  Confused, we ask for a manager.  She comes over to the table with her frown face in full force, as well.  Although we well exceeded our $20 Groupon credit with full priced items, the simple drink orders apparently voided its use.  We even tried to get two separate bills, one with drinks and one with food to use the groupon, and she outright said no.  She explains that the Groupon is not to be used when any other promotions are going on... which happens to be every night but Saturday.  

This place is full of incompetent people that overly concerned about nickel and diming customers.  If they don't like the promotions, don't offer them.  With the awful service and food, I don't doubt this place will be out of business before long.  In short, don't waste your time or your money."}
{"text":"We had tried this restaurant when it opened and were disappointed in the quality of food and service. We decided to give it another try last night. Our server, Taylor, was pleasant and attentive.  The food, however, was disappointing. The bread was dry and tasted stale. The minestrone soup tasted like watered -down pasta sauce with some shells and undercooked vegetables. The wedge of potato in it was almost raw. The entree was no better. The eggplant parm consisted of slices of flavorless eggplant topped with a slab of mozzarella. The accompanying pasta was perfectly cooked but served with a very sweet tomato sauce. The penne with chicken was just as bland. The server brought more chicken later because the kitchen had failed to put enough on when it was prepared. The best thing we ate was the cannoli which was fresh and delicious.  However, it was not enough to give us reason to return to Vito's"}
{"text":"Every time I come here the bartender is on point!!! I've had dinner here but come back because of his service"}
{"text":"Fantastic.  From the service to the food.  Had the pizza which was excellent! It's thin and cut in squares.  I love the sauce. I signed up for their email and got a coupon."}
{"text":"Had Bryan as a bartender! What an amazing experience! He totally made my night. The food was great, but the service was definitely above and beyond!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service and food!  My first time, and I will make sure to return often. Ravioli was some of the best I've ever had. Thank you for a wonderful evening and experience!"}
{"text":"Outstanding gluten free pizza, the best I've ever had.  Excellent wine list. My companions loved their pastas, seafood, and salads too. Outstanding service too. We had a very nice, enjoyable dining experience.  We will be back -- soon and often."}
{"text":"Always fresh ingredients. If you from the Chicago or New York areas this is the place with REAL Italian quality food and thin crust pizza !!"}
{"text":"Took my parents here the other night. It was a wonderful experience. We had bruschetta as an appetizer. Also, we had a veggie pizza and for dessert tiramisu. We ordered cappuccinos as well, which were amazing! Great service as well. We will return!"}
{"text":"Only been once and I had the veal parmigiana and wife had the seafood lasagna.  Wish we had followed the trend of the other diners and ordered pizza. Veal was mushy and the marinara was way too sweet. Seafood lasagna didn't sit well with my wife even though she enjoyed it while eating ( you can fill in the blanks here ). Drinks were sub par at best. Good service was the only bright spot and the reason for 2 instead of 1 star."}
{"text":"Went here with some homies and the manager gave us free canolis and a family discount because one of my homies works at the other Vito's and the food is BOMB. They real ones. 10/10"}
{"text":"Vitos on Lindsay Road, Mesa, Az. Worst dining experience ever!  From the rude, unfriendly, standoffish waiter, to a long hair in my food, to the Manager who was more puzzled from where the hair came!  Not from either of us, I and my guest have very close haircuts.  The Manager did apologize but it was way too little, not very sincere and that was the extent!  You can imagine what such a thing does to your appetite and getting a 'new' dish did not change that fact.  I have completed a customer questionnaire on Vito's website.   We will see how important their customers are to them.  Note, we have eaten here many times before and never has such an experience.  Am on the fence as to whether or not I can ever return here.

Today we heard from the owner and he apologized profusely.  He also stated he would address the issue with the waiter, speak with the manager who did not handle the issue appropriately.  He is also mailing a gift certificate. Based on his response, we will give it some time and perhaps be able to return."}
{"text":"I love that they offer a wheat crust option - more places need to hop on that. 

Restaurant was clean, pizza was delicious (I like the square cuts personally),

Would absolutely recommend checking it out if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is a bit noisy for my liking but the food is amazing!

Great for take out or dine in. They do a great job of packaging the take out so it all looks great when you get it home. 

Live music sometimes as well gives it the right atmosphere to drink a glass of wine (or three). 

Great Scottsdale steady.

{"text":"We went to dinner last night for mothers day. ...first the waiter broke two corks trying to open wine...he brought ice cold bread to our table...and then our dinners were all cold...won't be going back."}
{"text":"We have a winter home in Mesa and make sure we bring friends to Vito's every time we are down there. The pizza is OUTSTANDING!!! We have also gone there on Monday nights when they have their all you can eat pasta for only $10.
Any friends or guests that we take there love it as well."}
{"text":"Thank you Vito's staff and management.  We thoroughly enjoyed our evening with you. The food was amazing and Tyler was such a great server.  You made an already special night just that much more.  We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"The food is exceptional but what really made our dinner was our server \"ZANE\",  he did an amazing job and his polite and easy going attitude made our dinner very enjoyable. The Manager also checked up on us several times as well.  This is a awesome place for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Very crowded as it's one of the few nice places to eat in this area. Good food though. Prices are a bit expensive, but worth the quality. I didn't like the cheesecake."}
{"text":"First time here and had a big party with 2 infants. Asked for 2 high chairs then not even 10 minutes being there had to be asked by the manager to give one of the high chairs to another table because they were short one high chair and one of the infants in our party was being held so they took it. Then another waiter made a comment to another table stating ,\" I knew it would be a bad idea to make this place kid friendly and it would bite us in the butt.\" After over hearing that comment, it drives me crazy because babies should be able to be accepted anywhere! For them to make a comment about that is very disappointing because we were told this place was amazing .. food was good but service from staff sucked."}
{"text":"A bit pricey for Italian food but good food. Vegetarian double crust pizza is amazing."}
{"text":"In a word, FANTASTIC!  Best Italian food we've had since moving here 4 years ago.  Absolutely the best pizza and fabulous pizza rolls & pastas.  The sausage sandwich was excellent. So despite the 40 minute drive from our south Chandler residence, we're going to be regulars at Vito's from now on...it's worth the drive!  We were rotating between several other Italian restaurants but Vito's is now our go-to for great Italian food."}
{"text":"My husband and I had their pizza and wings and it was amazing! (We used the Dasher App. and were disappointed with that because when we received our pizza it was smooshed and ripped apart. It seemed our driver liked to hit the acceleration and brakes a little too hard and too much) Other then that the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Never have I had a bad experience (both dine-in and delivery).  The pizza is delicious.  The cannoli is perfect.  I've also tried the baked ziti and the chicken parmesean.  Again... delicious.  The time I did go in, I ordered the Sangria...it was perfect.  Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Okay, The waiter brought water and a menu. The menu looks good. 20 minutes later we were still sitting there with our menus and water.  Couldn't find the waiter so we got up and walked out. The bar tender never even acknowledged us as we were leaving or while we were there."}
{"text":"A little pricey for a family dinner, but, oh, so delicious!!!"}
{"text":".back to Vito 's again third time this week didn't think it could be any better I was wrong fantastic  meal.ashley was  fun and beyond helpful.she is the best."}
{"text":"Dinner here is always great. The shrimp Hawaiian pizza sounds weird, but trust me it is incredible. Their hot wings are also the best I've ever had- the sauce is so smokey and tasty. The spinach artichoke dip is also wonderful. Every dish I've had was great, especially the ravioli in the sunrise sauce and the chicken picatta. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Love this place...it's the perfect little place when you just want to relax at home just run through the drive through and forget all that other nasty stuff out there!"}
{"text":"The food was very tasty.  My wife and I started off with the fried Calamari which was perfect. Then we moved onto the entrees.  I would recommend the seafood lasagna, the scallops and crab was fresh and the sauce was slightly sweet and tasty.  My wife said her chicken tortalini was average.  Overall a good meal.  Prices were less than desired, but a groupon coupon took care of that."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and are glad that we did. The atmosphere is cozy almost like being in an old home. The wait staff is friendly courteous and attentive. We enjoyed the calamari we opted to have the herbed and it was excellent. Our pizza was crisp loaded with meat and very flavorful will definitely go back again"}
{"text":"You are paying for the name and the fact they have been around so long and have a \"reputation.\" Food was the same quality as Olive Garden, but more expensive the service was about the same as well, you are packed in you see you server, but normally buckle up because you will be there for a while waiting for easy to make food."}
{"text":"As I walked in to place an order I was greeted and taken care of as if I've been here everyday but truthfully it's only my 2nd time. Maddie is truly amazing with her service as a host and very observant to customers needs eventhough I was just there for a carryout. It's the small things like this that will get me to come back."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience. I had to plan a lunch for work and placed a large take out order for 11:00am (exactly when the restaurant opens). I was able to place the order online the day before and the manager actually called to verify that I had the right location as she noticed my home address was closer to the Scottsdale location. I appreciated the follow up making sure that everything was perfect. My coworker and I picked up the order at 11am, everything was ready, service was friendly and they helped us carry the large order to the car. Most importantly, my coworkers were RAVING about how great the food was. Absolute hit."}
{"text":"This was my first visit at the invitation of a friend.  WHAT TOOK ME SO LONG?!! 
We sat at a table in the bar area because both the patio and the main dining room were full but what a PLEASANT EXPERIENCE it was!!  Bobby our server/ bartender was very attentive and his recommendations were SPOT ON - from the cocktails all the way through dessert!  The manager came to our table to welcome us and we spoke for a while - a very nice touch!  (Customer service starts from the top).  I can hardly wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Molto Bene!!!  We went last Tuesday night and it was packed but well worth the wait.  The very best sausage calzone I've ever had, and I will be 50 this year.  My wife had a chicken salad and loved it, daughter had pizza rolls and loved them and my parents had fettuccine and loved it too.  Thank you Vito's, our new favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the worst restaurant I have be in in a very long time. We waited while the hostess chatted with her friends. Then we were seated in a booth that the seat was so worn that I sank into a hole. Then we ordered our food. It was the most tasteless food and was served like slop. We tried to eat it. We ended by getting the check. The waiter could see we didn't eat the food but did ask if there was anything wrong. We walked out after paying and were both sick before we could arrive home. 
Don't bother going here. Service, food were terrible.  I would give it zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"Living real in a dreamy place.
Location is a hidden gem in Mesa.  The pizza we had ordered is okay.  $30 for a super thin crust and basic ingredients. 
I wouldn't order a pizza again. But would find my way back for their other options on the menu and their location."}
{"text":"Excellent food, prepared in a traditional Italian way. Happy to have found this place! The service was top notch and our waiter Vinny was excellent. We just discovered Vito's, but will be back again and again.
Compliments to the kitchen staff, wait staff and the warm welcome we got from the manager Giselle. 
A great place to take friends and family!
Earl & Geri"}
{"text":"This place has some great food. Try their buffalo chicken pizza. So good and has a little kick to it. I have always had good experiences here. The owner also gave us some free drink for no reason. Great atmosphere and even better food."}
{"text":"Have been to many pizza places in Mesa,by far best in valley,also they make the best martinis around.Brian L.,bartender on Sat nights give you not also great drinks,but also 5 star service!Won't go anywhere else!Thanks!Scott P."}
{"text":"I loved my visit to Vito's! My party of seven sat in the bar on a super busy evening, but we still had such great service thanks to Alex! He was so quick and attentive to all of our needs. Plus the food was absolutely delicious! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Vito's has excellent food. I've been impressed the few times I've gone there.

What does NOT impress me is that their database of email addresses got hacked, I notified them about it over 2 months ago, they never responded, and I'm still getting spoof mail that looks just like it's from them but it is not. I won't post the URL's to where the links in the emails go for precaution BUT this should happen:

1) ANY company that gets their customers' email addresses stolen should be forthright about notifying their customers so they can take necessary security measures.
2) YOU NEVER IGNORE A CUSTOMER AND NOT EMAIL THEM BACK ABOUT SECURITY CONCERNS.

Vito's has done neither. So far as I'm concerned I can eat somewhere else when I want a special meal."}
{"text":"We dropped in for lunch at 12:30,and were the only customers in the place.  Not a good sign.  We ordered a salad and asked for some bread.  We were told bread is not normally served.  (No bread in an Italian restaurant?)  They did manage to rustle up two rolls for us, however.  When the salad arrived, it was not the salad we ordered.  We were, though, charged $3 for having the salad divided in the kitchen.  That was all we needed, so we left without ordering anything else.  We'll never return."}
{"text":"Impecable service all 13 times we've gone there.  My only issue is that the lasagna is SO good, I can't seem to bring myself to try anything else on the menu!! Canolis are great also.  Wondering whether they will have a \"special menu\" for New Years Eve. That might be when I'm \"forced\" to try something new!  LOL!"}
{"text":"I don't want to say how AMAZING Vito's is because it might get overrun get too busy !!  ;)
The restaurant is CLEAN, updated and big.  The wait staff is GREAT !!!  And the food was AWSOME !!!!
I had the blackened chicken risotto that was HUGE, tasted great and the chicken was so moist & tender I was almost able to cut it w/ my fork. My husband has the chicken piccata and said it was one of the best he's ever tried.  We split the large caesar salad and it was fresh, different but really really good.  The bread was good and the stuffed mushrooms were okay. 
My mixed drink was EXCELLENT and my husband had the Plan B red wine & said it was the best he'd ever had.  Almost forgot that the lemon berry mascarpone cake was very good but the cannoli was average."}
{"text":"Food is great! Service is great!  Our waitress was Stacy and she was helpful, engaging and happy.  We were sat right away and immediately attended to.  We had the calamari, very good.  Salmon ceasar salad,,,the salmon was cooked perfectly, eggplant parm, veal parm and the canolis!  All were great!  Stacy reccomend a few great wines as well, we were very happy.  Will definately return."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of time. The first time we went with friends. I had the eggplant parm. It was very good. Not an overly huge portion but it had all the components that made it good, tasty sauce, served hot, fresh grated cheese, etc..
  
Most recently we ordered pizza to take out last week. The food is always good and the service is good. My only complaint is that it seemed a bit pricey for a pizza. Granted it was a specialty pizza & a large but $28 seems a little high priced to me.   I'll keep an eye out for any specials or coupons and we'll go back when/if we can get a bit of a deal."}
{"text":"Always a good one. Vito's is authentic and the line at the door will tell you this! We've always had great service too. Their spaghetti Alfredo is good- especially on all-you-can-eat pasta nights. Happy hour is very decent!"}
{"text":"Have stopped in for happy hour a few times and once for dinner. Happy hour is a better experience with friendly and attentive bartenders and an extensive appetiser menu. Also have specials posted at the bar that are small plates (seafood scampi/stuffed pepper) that are delicious. Dinners I've been less impressed with. Pizza ordered once was terribly soggy and way over sauced. Joined a friend for dinner another time and Seafood over Linguini was ok but uninspiring. Overall this is a reliable neighborhood stop, close to home with great happy hour and friendly service."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was excellent! It is pretty pricey but that's not the reason for the 4 stars.  We ordered a chicken parmigiana and were told the pasta that usually comes with it would need to be ordered a la carte? I have never heard of that.  We probably will not be back because of the amount of food for the price and there are other delicious more affordable places nearby.  But everything was delicious!  Pizzas, lasagna, Alfredo and parmigiana!"}
{"text":"Arizona has real Italian food thanks to Vito's Pizza & Italian Ristorante.  The food heroes simply amazing.  Parking can be a bit hectic depending on the time since they somewhat share their lot with the adjacent car-wash.  

Totally worth it.  This place will Not disappoint. 

Once inside this small hole in the wall actually has two floors of seating and their service is top notch.  

Their pizza is simply amazing, in the top 10 pizzas I've ever stuffed my face with! The chicken parm was also amaze! And goes what... their tiramisu also amaze!"}
{"text":"Extremely slow service, if you order pizza it is quick, otherwise slow.  Quality has really dropped."}
{"text":"After reading all of the reviews on this place I was completely caught by surprise. Usually Yelp reviews are quite reliable but you all got this one wrong.  First the atmosphere is quite nice but when the place is full the noise level is unbearable. I sat in a booth with my wife and two kids and struggled to hear anything that was said. For the record I am 43 and in great health with no hearing problems. Even my nine year old son complained about how loud it was.  As for the food, well here comes the real disappointment. My wife ordered meat filled ravioli and it was topped with a very commercial tasting bolognese (meat) sauce.  I had the veal parmigiana and although the veal itself was of god quality and tender, it came out with literally no sauce on it, but just breaded veal with some melted cheese on top. I ordered a side of sauce which improved the dish, but once again their marinara was very commercial and generic. The kids shared a simple cheese pizza which is supposedly thin crust Chicago style. I am not going to complain about the crust as I was not sure what to expect to begin with as I am not a knowledgable source regarding Chicago style pizza (my specialties are NY & Neapolitan styles), although my wife referred to the crust as a cracker with little texture or flavor. Continuing... the sauce and cheese combination was lacking flavor altogether and it was just overall boring. As a matter of fact as I write this review I just overheard my wife and son discussing the flavor of the pizza last night and my son said it was of Domino's quality, but he would prefer Dominos over the pizza at Vitos. That is sad as my son does not like Dominos pizza at all and can distinguish between a good pizza and a not so good one as we eat pizza weekly and also make it in our home frequently.  As for the service, no complaints as the staff were very friendly. We were seated quickly because we made a reservation, but there was quite a long line with a 20-30 minute wait at 6:30pm on a Saturday.  I personally would not go back to Vitos, but for all of you that are willing to give it a try, please keep in mind that my opinion is limited to the dishes that we tried and not encompassing of the entire menu. That being said, what we ordered was very basic Italian and may be a good representation of what is to be expected menu-wide. By the way, for the four of us, the items I mentioned plus a couple of sodas, an onion soup appetizer, side salad, and no desert, the bill was $54 which seems reasonable for that amount of food, but not justified due to the lack of flavor. In my opinion, for the similar price structure you get better food at Nicks, which is also not my favorite, but comparable in price and menu offerings. Good eats to all!!!"}
{"text":"First time at Vito's. I had a bogo coupon which prompted me to try it.   What a nice surprise! The restaurant is a very large, attractive place.  The decor is very appealing.   
We ordered a chianti to start off but I was not really pleased with it.  I guess for $7, I don't have too much to complain about.  I expect chianti's to be fuller bodied and leaning toward a sweet side without actually being sweet. Not this one.  
We ordered Penne Arrabbiata with chicken and chicken piccata.  I asked for extra capers on the piccata.  Both dishes were nicely prepared and amply portioned.  The chicken piccata provided two chicken breasts and a lovely white wine sauce with capers.  I was impressed with the tenderness of the breasts.  Most places overcook white meat, they did not.  The spaghettini was coated with the lovely caper sauce and while spaghettini was thin, it was not overcooked.  I really loved this dish.  My companion had the pasta arrabbiata which is supposed to be spicy but was not.  I tasted the red sauce and while it was good enough, it was not better than mine.  The pieces of chicken in the dish were not overdone.  This place has a knack for doing chicken correctly.  
We asked for bread and was surprised we had to ask.  Most italian places serve complimentary bread.  Some are now charging for it.  There is a new place in Phoenix that wants $8 for the bread basket.  Not good. 
The service provided by Ace was fine.  He had a party he was attending to in the party room yet was able to manage our table as well.  Regardless of the wine, our dishes were good enough that this place merits 5 stars.  The bogo coupon made it a real value as well.  
We look forward to coming back soon."}
{"text":"If three stars is A-OK I have to go with 2 stars which is \"Meh\".  Two of us for dinner sampled four dishes: Caesar salad , mussels, eggplant parmesan with pasta, and an asparagus appetizer. Asparagus was breaded and deep fried; not my favorite way.  Salad was OK. Mussels were OK (not A-OK). Eggplant parmesan was disappointing. I like the eggplant a bit crispy...fried in a skillet with bread crumbs and seasoning and then served with pasta but not drowned in pasta, soggy, and barely distinguishable. The portion of eggplant was small.  Sauce and pasta were OK.

Service was OK, things were clean, the dining room was modern and spacious. Bread served with the meal was not worth eating; soft white bread. 

Good Italian food is hard to come by.  Vito's is better than some, not as good as the best.  All in all...Meh."}
{"text":"Last night's attempt at dining at Vito's will be our last.  We had previously visited Vito's on a consistent basis (initially, at least once or twice per week) for drinks, appetizers, and/or dinner at the bar.  While the food is only of mediocre quality, the convenience offered by a location so close to home seemed to compensate for this factor as well as the cramped quarters at the bar and the seemingly perpetual presence of at least one or two loud, obnoxious patrons who repeatedly made their sojourns to the parking lot only to return reeking of cigarette smoke.  More recently, our visits became a bit less frequent due to the increasing filth present on the bar.  The last few times we visited, we entered to find only one or two patrons at the bar, but the entire rest of the bar occupied by other customers' dirty dishes that had not been cleared.  While the staff would quickly clear enough space for us to sit down, the dishes would be removed, but no effort was ever made to wipe away the food that was caked to the bar.  Glancing around, however, the reason for the staff's lack of attention to waiting on actual customers typically became readily apparent due to the presence of her Royal Majesty, the owner, perched in a prime booth with her entourage demanding the majority of the staff's time and efforts at the expense of the paying customers.  On numerous occasions, we sat with empty glasses for 10-15 minutes while the staff chatted with and tended to the owner and her royal court.

While the convenience factor allowed us to tolerate these issues, the failure of a restaurant to remain open during its posted hours is a fatal error.  We arrived to dine at Vito's last night only to be informed by the bartender that the restaurant had closed A FULL 45 MINUTES PRIOR TO THEIR POSTED TIME.  Customers rely on the hours that a business states that it will be open when making plans and a failure to remain open for business until such a time presents an inconvenience significant enough that we will not burden this establishment with our patronage again.  Vito's may not care about the time customers must waste driving to a different restaurant when they had planned on stopping in for a convenient meal, but I can assure them that we will not risk the aggravation of the time wasted on a Sunday evening with a long week of work looming on the horizon.  Bye, bye Vito's.  We won't miss you."}
{"text":"Vito's pizza is great . I eat the gluten free menu and it is the best pizza ! My friend had the seafood pasta and it was fresh and delicious. The restaurant was very upscale and had a great bar area with many big screen tvs."}
{"text":"Ordered food to go via DoorDash. There was hair in the pizza And the chicken was really tough and over cooked"}
{"text":"Nice looking restaurant with decent food.  They have a bid menu too.   Unfortunately, they have a pathetic happy hour."}
{"text":"Ryan the manager invited us back in tonight and Logan took great care of us. We had the seafood bruschetta it was amazing. We then had the margarita pizza it tasted like the old Vito's we know and love! Thank you Logan the server we had was also outstanding tonight!y"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, great staff love the pizza very reasonably priced. Great for date night, feel little Italian romantic."}
{"text":"Vitos has long been a favorite spot for my wife and I to enjoy a glass of wine, relax and share a plate of great Italian food - over the years we've enjoyed a quick bite in their bar - sitting out on the patio when the weather allows or dining in their main dining area... We've even attended several of the seasonal comedy shows in the it basement (highly recommended if you've never done it).  We often ride our bikes there as we live just a few blocks away - tonight we had taken a bike ride and stopped at Vitos for some wine and pizza in the bar - we were sitting at the bar, watching the NFL game and sparked up conversation with several other locals. As always the food was excellent, service was great and the vibe fun - but tonight was different - when we went to pay our bill we were told the check had already been picked up by a \"secret Santa\" - first time this has happened to us and no surprise it was at Vitos! - we love this place and this experience is a testament to the owners and the establishment they run - we have always enjoyed this restaurant as our own 'local' hang out and love it even more after this experience - we can't wait to come back and pay it forward!"}
{"text":"I was with my husband today at Vito's Pizza and I had Linguini Pescatore and my husband had some Personal Pizza; we really enjoy the food at Vito's , they don't abuse of the spicy flavors for make good the taste of the food, they really conserve a great Italian style, very classic e molto delizioso!"}
{"text":"Fun , romantic, and great place to go out on a date. Has been in my neighborhood for as long as I can remember . The pizza is my favorite ! The deluxe pizza is a perfect fit for a supreme pizza . My family also loves the chicken arriabata, rigatoni ala vito, and the meatball sandwhich . Make sure you save room for dessert! Their chocolate lava cake oozes with hot fudge and comes with ice cream! Or they have canolis (an Italian dessert) with one end dipped in pistachios and the other end in chocolate chips! Phenomenal! Also, the cheesecake is light and fluffy with a graham cracker crust that melts in your mouth! I normally top my cheesecake with fresh slice strawberries or blueberries . Lastly, the seasonal dessert right now is a pumpkin crunch. It is the perfect amount of pumpkin with a rich graham cracker crust! Love it! Vito's is a place to bring family and friends to be treated like family . Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place just was not very good.

My in-laws suggested it as they'd been there before, we were in the area and needed to get dinner. 

It was initially quite promising, as it is in a cute little building that is decorated in a quaint Italian style. The restaurant itself is HUGE, with a series of different rooms all stuffed to the gills with tables. There was a long wait (over 20 minutes), which was weird for a random Wednesday evening in the middle of Mesa, but I was hopeful that it meant the food was great!

The night was beautiful, so we sat out on the patio to enjoy the great weather. The bread served to start was negligible. The server seemed VERY new to serving and it showed. She seemed shy and had trouble talking to the table. I asked a question about the greens in one of the salads and she initially gave me the incorrect answer so I decided to have another item (she came back later to correct it, but we had already ordered so I just stuck with what I had decided on) 

Their menu is really basic - pizzas, pasta... that's pretty much it. There are very few/almost no options that are protein centric - anything with a protein has pasta, sauce, etc. so if you are trying to eat healthy and don't want one of their (underwhelming) salads, you're really left without options. We ordered pastas and they were okay but not great - there wasn't a lot of flavor to what we got - Chicken Marsala, Penne Caprese. 

The prices seemed pretty high for the quality/flavor of the food. 

Oh, and at the end of the meal someone hanging out nearby on the patio lit up a cigarette, which I personally hate and also thought was pretty inconsiderate since our 1.5 year old son was with us. 

All in all, I don't really want to ever return."}
{"text":"We go to this place on our anniversary every year.  My better half had the pizza which was yummy.  I had the beef stroganoff.  It was really good too.  This time we ordered the bruschetta plates.  I loved the one with the salami and gouda cheese.  The service was good and the food was excellent too."}
{"text":"Excellent Happy Hour!   Been coming here for past 2 yrs and we typically sit in the very comfy booths in bar area.  LOVE the pizza, deep fried asparagus.  Portions are good.  Drinks are wonderful. Service is excellent. Highly recommend as a neighborhood favorite!"}
{"text":"This place is somewhere between 3 and 4 stars, but I like to give the benefit of the doubt.  The first time I came here was for takeout.  I ordered at the bar and had a beverage in the interim while I waited for my pizza.  The bar patrons were very nice and knowledgeable about the menu; one gentleman even let me try his food when it came from the kitchen (seafood lasagna- yum)!  They gave me some great tips on food to try from the menu in the future.  My company and I thought the pizza was very good and perfectly cooked.  It was not the best pizza ever, but it hit the spot!

On a second occasion, I came here on a date.  I found the lights to be rather bright in the dining room (bar much better), but I am all about dim lighting anyway, so maybe I am biased.  Also, our server was too attentive.  I hate to say that because he was very nice and charming, but the interruptions were kind of annoying (my date actually mentioned it to me too).  Another thing not helping the ambiance was a table of drunk golfers that needed hearing aides, making our intimate conversation rather challenging (not that it was the restaurant's fault).  

More importantly, I guess you mainly go to a restaurant for food and Vito's did not disappoint.  I cannot remember what my date had, but I know the plate was empty at the end, and it looked and smelled good upon arrival.  I had the veal Marsala (don't hate me- yes I ate a baby cow), and it was amazing...The sauce was great, the pasta perfectly al dente, and the meat was tender as expected.  I did not think I could finish it all because the portion was HUGE, but I did :)"}
{"text":"Went here with the family for a weeknight dinner, crowd wasn't too bad. There didn't seem to be that many tables, but considering it's a small restaurant, I guess that's okay. For a family owned business, I think it's solid.

Decor seemed very nice, wasn't overdone. Main menu is not overwhelming, just four different pages for appetizers, salads, pizza, pasta and chef entrees. Appreciated that most of these dishes had mainly English names. As much as I love Italian food, I can't pronounce most of my favorite dishes!

Let's break it down by courses. For appetizers, we got the bruschetta and calamari. Calamari was crisp and light, not drenched in oil like other places can do. The cajun sauce was well too. As for the bruschetta, they didn't skimp out on the toppings at all! I felt like it was a monster of a piece, with tomatoes falling off mid-bite. Might be a bit messy, but I liked it!

Did I mention the free bread. Pretty sure we got some pesto butter, and three varieties of bread that were foccacia, wheat, and white.

I ordered a side salad with my main dish. Wide variety of dressings, but I decided to change my traditional balsamic to their apple cider vinegarette. I will say it's VERY sweet just like the drink, so I was glad they kept the dressing on the side. Interesting take I haven't seen yet.

My main course was the Veal Piccata. Warning, I found their portions to be VERY BIG. The veal was cooked nicely, sauce wasn't overwhelming. The side of spaghetti was cooked decently, though it felt like it was something I could've done at home. The roasted vegetables looked fine, but I didn't have enough room to finish my meal,

I think the prices were justified, about $100 for the family of four, with an ice tea and beer included. Staff was friendly, food was good. Not sure if I'd come back here, but I didn't regret it."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and just stumbled across Vito's with some new friends I met..I have to say it takes a lot for me to give out 5 stars but hey, I give it when it is deserved. The layout of the building is nice, I like the decor and the staff greeted us warmly. We elected to sit at the bar and ordered from Alyssa. 

I wasn't sure what I wanted so Alyssa asked me what I liked...I told her I wanted shrimp but not sure if I wanted it with pasta. Alyssa had the chef whip me up an AWESOME spicy shrimp dish...I'm not sure what it was called because it's off menu but it was perfect! 

Think jumbo shrimp cooked and drenched in a spicy sauce with garlic buttered bread and all kinds of flavorful goodness! I loved it! I will surely come back and bring my friends to Vito's.. Thank you Alyssa for the great recommendation and the great service!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Mesa location many times in the 40 years always great.  Moved to Scottsdale and of course had to try this one.  Even better!  Great local place, friendly staff and as expected excellent food!  I wish they would deliver to our home sometimes if they are slow they will but other times we are \"two miles out of their radius\". That's the only downside , I never know if I have to go pick up. They would get a lot of delivery in our Hidden Hills sub-division.   They are missing out on some good business.  I would recommend the drive!"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Scottsdale I drop in to Vito's. I love their happy hour menu and I'm a huge fan of the traditional Italian food. Best pizza in town including their Mesa location, which I've visited from referrals before. The new Scottsdale location has a great ambience and the interior is SUPERB. I love the feeling of being home that I get when I visit."}
{"text":"This is the ONLY place in North Scottsdale that has authentic Chicago style pizza.
The pizza is absolutely fantastic.  The crust is thin and they don't use the cornmeal on the bottom (thank you for that!).  The sauce is perfect, and not sweet.  Great spices especially the oregano and they don't skimp on the cheese.  
Now let's talk about their fantastic home made sausage.  It is perfect and the best pizza topping ever!
Kudos to Julie and her crew for such great food and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great place.  Good wine list.  Pizza  very good. Staff remembers  you and greets you warmly. Some nice additions to the wine list.  

Try it out"}
{"text":"Great food and easy to find location.  Parking is so-so, spots can be pretty tight.  The decor/ambiance is decent.  Pastas are good, Pizza is good, Salads are good.  It's more expensive than, say, Olive Garden...but you get what you pay for.  I would love to eat her more often!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Mesa a little over a year and never knew this little gem existed. The restaurant has a delightful italian charm ambiance. I was sat very quickly, and the service was quick and friendly. As an appetizer, I had the calamari, which was perfectly crisp on the outside and tender, no rubbery or chewy on the inside. For my entree, I had eggplant parmesan. It was at least a 3 person sized portion but was cheesy, crispy, and delicious. I have heard that their pizza is amazing as well so will definitely be trying that soon!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food (great pizza, apps and the bar always has something fantastic on the board as the daily special) and service. Love to go for happy hour. Its pretty quiet, older crowd and not too crowded. Live music on Saturdays."}
{"text":"I have had several good experiences, but on my last visit the pasta was dry and I was overall unimpressed.  Still a good go to place for Mesa, but hopefully this doesn't become the norm."}
{"text":"This is the newest place I have found and it is very close to me. 

They mail out coupons and that brought us in. Their pizza is amazing! Great quality and excellent taste. We went on a Thursday and they had happy hour specials on drinks. They were also great and all 3 of us enjoyed our beverages. 

We had a buy one, get one coupon and used it for pizza and pasta. The pasta was just okay, but the pizza, drinks, atmosphere, and server made up for it. 

Great restaurant at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Vito's food is excellent. I highly recommend  this restaurant.  Also, our server  Angela is amazing! She is so sweet and professional.  We will ask for  her each time we come back. Thanks again Angela for awesome service !"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for YEARS!  I miss it so much now that I live in Tucson.  They have great pizza and garlic bread.  My favorite pizza is meatball with tomato (cooked, not added after pizza comes out of the oven).  My mouth is watering just thinking about this pizza.  Mmmmmm......."}
{"text":"Came up number one on the search for a reason! 
This place is bomb. Cool atmosphere, great food! Try the Seafood Paella! Bomb digity! Sorry didn't have time to take a foodie pic lol. 

Lauren, the manager, was exceptionally cool and well serviced. Made the experience ever better! I've been in the restaurant industry for years and I always commend a manager worthy of working for! 

5 stars and a return customer for sure!"}
{"text":"Love the seafood pasta.  The salads are a great portion and the service is outstanding,  which is hard to find lately. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place is so close to my new home and I was so excited to try it out so my daughter and I stopped by for lunch a few weeks ago.   I must say it was very large, clean and had a very nice atmosphere.   The place was empty so we were seated right away.  The waitress came right away to take our order and seem knowledgable about the menu.  We ordered the calamari as an appetizer, we were asked if we wanted it fried or grilled?  I asked the waitress about it and she suggested the grilled calamari.  As an entree I ordered the baked ziti and my daughter ordered the penne quatro formaggio. 

 Our appetizer arrived shorty, it was not what I expected, it was at best mediocre in taste and very spicy. My daughter was not able to eat any of it so I made the best of it.   Our entrees arrived soon after, the food looked pretty good.  I tried my pasta and the taste was 7 out of 10.  However, the garlic bread that was served with my meal was very greasy.   My daughter's pasta had a very nice flavor but it was covered with an inch of oil.  She tried to stir the pasta but more oil was accumulating, it was disgusting.  I called the waitress over and showed her the oily pasta and asked her to bring my daughter something else.   A cook? who was standing nearby looked over to see what was going on and she explained to him that \" it happened again\".  \"Again?\" I asked, no one answer, she took the pasta and came back later with the menu and asked my daughter to choose something else.  She picked the tortellini.  

10 minutes later, her pasta arrived, my food was cold and we finally got an explanation to what happened to the pasta, sort of!  It seems that during the cooking process the cheese \"broke\" whatever that means.

The tortellini was extremely mediocre, we've had store bought ones that tasted much better and cost far less.  They did not even offer to reheat my meal after I waited for my daughter's and to top it all off, we were charged for the entire meal.

Needless to say that I am never ever coming back to this place.  Their management has a lot to learn about good customer service and obviously their kitchen staff needs to learn how to cook as well."}

{"text":"Just plain great pizza!!! We had first found Vito's about 10 years ago, as visitors from Chicago. We forgot name and lost track, finally we were able to track it down. Brought friends to dinner, before attending an Afters Concert, had to order a second pizza for the road trip back to our current home in Las Vegas the following day. There pizza is as good as Chicago's!!!"}
{"text":"2 stars for food, 5 for waiter experience. 
We drive by this place on a regular basis and visit Kona coffee next door, I always noticed that it is quite busy. Stopped in on a Tues evening prior to a movie.We just had time for a few tap beers and an appetizer. The young man waiter was very nice, we have not had such a kind person wait on us in a restaurant in a long time. We ordered \"grilled\" calamari, as opposed to breaded. We received \"sour dough\" bread and a very nice whipped herb butter. The bread tasted stale and not real sour dough flavor. The calamari was very tiny and almost raw-- NOT grilled, it tasted microwaved, had no grill marks and was extremely chewy. The accompanying sauce was great but the calamari failed. No one was available to check our bill out. I would have liked to been told about the appetizers that I didn't notice as written on the board behind the bar. 
We will return though. Hopefully the owner and chef will listen to feedback. The couple next to me also provided feedback to the waitress about their dish. This could be a regular place for us if they step it up in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good atmosphere, good company!  Vito's is a for sure nice time."}
{"text":"Last minute decision for a birthday dinner really paid off. Tuesday special 1/2 priced bottle of wine. Chicago style pizza with  a visitor from Chicago. Excellent pizza and appetizers. Our server Steve was spot on. Thanks"}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here with the hubby, I ordered the salmon dinner and was impressed both the blackened salmon and the side of veggies were awesome. This also came with parm risotto which was too dry:(

My husband got the creamy seafood risotto and he loved it! 

Jenna was our server and although new she was great, fast and very helpful!

And then the dessert  cheesecake and tiramisu! Why not cuz apparently Wednesday nights are half off desserts. Both very good, we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We have now been into this place quite a few times as it is about 100 yards from my home. My mom has turned into a Friday lunch regular and become friends with the woman I previously complained about. I am confident now that with the proper staffing, this has changed.

Two instances that have been awesome. I had to get my car's tires replaced so of course I thought, oh! I'll go to vitas for some lunch, I also had bronchitis so I was feeling like a bit of a mess. I walked in and the place was very quiet so I sat at the bar to watch the world cup. The bartender, not the same, as above, was so awesome. She made me a hot toddy for my throat, suggested lunch, and was extremely great for me being her only patron at the bar. The manger was also there and super friendly, and easy going. I walked out of there feeling relaxed and loving it. 

Another instance, more recently, my boyfriend and I ventured over on a week night for some italian and wine. Our favorite bartender was working and the bar area was PACKED. She was absolutely phenomenal, getting our drinks, lasagna, refills, and making sure we were taken care of as well as the other tables. and seriously, that lasagna-- DELICIOUS! 

I would definitely recommend this place, and have."}
{"text":"all of the food at vitos is tastless, really does not have much taste at all. so if you have blah taste buds this is the place for you.it is also over priced"}
{"text":"Ordered fettuccine Alfredo and the sauce was completely separated. It looked like butter and curdled cheese. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been to this restaurant on two other occasions and found the meals to be quite good.  This time, we brought friends that had never been there before and were extremely disappointed.
  First off, it took forever for a waiter or waitress to come to our table to take a drink order.  Water was never served unless asked for.  Everyone's meal was just mediocre to bland and we all had different entrees.  Before dinner was over, the waiter brought our check.  When we stopped him and asked about having dessert and coffee, he apologized, took away the check and brought over dessert menus.  We had to point out to him that some of us were still eating our entree.  Again he apologized.  We wondered if this was his first job and if so, more training was definitely needed. 
Don't believe we will be returning to this restaurant.  Too many excellent italian restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"Well, my experience here was just ok. I had contacted them because they were a preferred vendor for my wedding venue and I wanted to check them out. Their food was delicious, reasonably priced and the lady helping us seemed very friendly. She even offered us samples of the food without us even asking. She showed me sample menus, pricing for silverware/flatware packages and spent well over an hour with us discussing florists, menu options, seating arrangements and what not. So why the 3 stars? She NEVER GOT BACK TO ME about my wedding. When I tried to call back to speak to her, no one answered the phone....oookkaayyy??? 
I'm very disappointed because they were the only affordable place on my preferred vendors list. Hopefully I'll find someone else."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to trying this neighborhood restaurant since we heard good reviews about its Mesa location.

We were incredibly disappointed.

There were 4 hostesses at the front desk, none of whom could care less about actually greeting us.  We felt as if it we were an imposition to take our name.

After waiting for our table, we were seated about 20 minutes later.  The service just went downhill from there.  The waitress, Angela, was slow, inexperienced, and not particularly knowledgeable about the wine list.  She even kept apologizing for the poor service and acknowledging her responsibility for it.

While I have to say, the food was very good, we will not be back because the service was so poor."}
{"text":"First time at Vito's today , food was so fresh , presentation beautiful ! The service was great also , very happy ! Will be back"}
{"text":"A new try for us in Mesa AZ. We found Vito's on Opentable.com.  Reviews we favorable and I would have to agree. It's not necessarily the healthiest food to eat, but that's Italian cooking as a whole. The service was outstanding from the moment we checked in. Our waiter Steven was very professional and attentive. We had the chicken marsala which was very good but rich, for two people who eat very clean 99% of the time.  Give Vito's a try. There menu has a variety of interesting dishes and there pizza looks yummy. We will return!"}
{"text":"We have been here a number of times but this was our first dinner.  We both had pasta entrees which included sausage. They were great. What would have improved our dining experience would have been a server asking if we wanted anything else. I wanted another glass of wine. My wife wanted dessert. Instead we got the check.  We commented on our interest in spending more money and were told  it is never too late but it seemed easiest to pay and go. We will be back since this is a good place."}
{"text":"So, my wife and her girlfriends have been coming here for a few months. Well they finally convinced me to try it! 
The ribeye is excellent, great flavor, calamari is awesome too! Very glad I gave Vitos a try.. will definitely be coming back. Ace was our server and he was great."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing! They have the best pizza in town!!! I would suggest them every time!! I go there at least twice a week! Great service too!"}
{"text":"Called in an order at 4:30 on a Sunday. I was on hold for over five minutes. 
Ordered a large thin crust meatball and pepperoni, a large antipasto salad and cheesy garlic bread. They said it would be ready in 20 minutes.
The order was ready on time, hot and fresh. The take out person was very friendly and efficient. The food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews and figured I would give it a chance.  Anyone who thinks this is the best pizza in Arizona (or anywhere else for that matter) is just kidding themselves.  Came during lunch on a tuesday and the place was empty (beautiful decorated inside to be sure).  Ordered a personal pan pizza and out comes a 9 inch.  I took one bite and thought that this is one step over frozen pizza like California Pizza Kitchen.  You won't get food poisoning as I barely tasted it while eating it and hours after.  It's just kind of a nothing, bland, very well made frozen pizza.

Having been to Peppe's in New Haven, CT I can tell you that this world's away in taste and quality.  If you want a high end frozen pizza, Vito has it.  If you want real pizza, go to Grimaldi's or Bianco or move back east to hellish New Haven."}
{"text":"Pizza was great. Service and atmosphere were super. Enjoyed the evening. We checked on using Yelps Check in feature and that really shortened the wait for us. Glad to see they use this feature as this night was packed."}
{"text":"Just received a delivery order from vitos. Absolute garbage. My spaghetti and meatballs was pure garbage. The  meatballs were dry and cold.Tthe plastic container in it came in was cold. the spaghetti was stuck together  like it was sitting out for hours. My friend's bake ziti got a zero rating from him, and the penne garbage his wife ordered was not thrilled with pasta. The spaghetti sauce was dry and for 15 dollars at least throw in a little bread like real Italian places do.

My expectations were low to begin with when ordering from a place in Arizona that I never tried before but I am so pissed off that for a total bill of $51 I expect it to at least be warm. When I called to let them know my disappointment they were referring me to a manager. I hung up in fear I would lose control over my emotions. I work too damn hard to be ripped off like this. 

I would rather eat stale bread with a can of spaghetti Os. All I can say we were all hungry wanting to eat a decent meal. I am even pissed of that I gave a generous tip to the delivery guy, that is how bad the whole order was...and for vitos the check no. is 145 red 201 on 10/1/2015 7:22 pm. Whoever prepared that meal or is running the kitchen should be gone.

Oh by the way, the coyotes just turned their nose up to spaghetti I threw out the door, that is how bad vitos take out food is."}
{"text":"Incredible evening!!! As a forth generation Sicilian living in Mesa, i have to say this is one incredible Italian restaurant. Everything was top notch, the food, the service. If you are new in town or you want to impress some business clients, bring them to Vitos! You will be glad that you did. Ask for Kim to get great service."}
{"text":"Loved this place. We went here for Happy Hour and loved the ambiance and food.  Little pricey but great for HH and awesome staff.  Nice addition to this area.  We will be back!

{"text":"We drive by this place all the time and don't know why it took us so long to try it! This is my favorite pizza in town right now. And their service was amazing!"}
{"text":"Waited 50 minutes for two drinks, an appetizer, and sandwich. Great sangria but average food and service."}
{"text":"Really good food and the service was great!  The  shrimp and crab cannoli was very delicious.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Vitos has never disappointed us. We have been there many times. We take all of our out of town guests there. It has great food at great prices and the staff is super."}
{"text":"My dining experience at Vito's Italian restaurant was different to say the least. My friend and i arrived at 7:30 on a Wednesday evening and the dining room was at full capacity, which was to be expected. We were greeted by the hostess and were told there was about a 20 minute wait. I asked the hostess if we could sit in the bar area which had four tables that were not being occupied. There was one person sitting at the bar. the hostess told us we could go ahead and seat ourselves, which we did. The bartender, who was also our server looked at us when we say down, then proceeded with her conversation with the customer at the bar. Ten minutes went by and i had made eye contact with the bartender several times as she still hadn't come over to give us menus. I'm assuming her conversation was over because then she came to our table, mind you,  it was only three feet from the bar at most and asked if we were ready to order. To be honest with you, I almost laughed. Instead I asked if we could see a menu. She said, \"oh yea, let me grab you one\". she brought the menus over and started to walk away. I said, \"excuse me, do you think we could order a drink?\". I ordered a miller lite and an iced tea, and my friend ordered a glass of water. Five minutes later we had our drinks, again keep in mind the bar is no more than three feet away. The bartender came over with our drinks and says \" are you ready to order?\". My friend then asks her if he could have a crown and coke. She says \"yeah\", then walks to the bar and makes the crown and coke. She leaves it sitting on the bar and proceeds to walk right past us to the dining room area. She is gone for at least ten minutes. I can see her in the dining room talking to another employee. She walks right past us again, goes behind the bar and starts talking to the only customer at the bar, yet again. At this point I'm a little irritated. I walk up to the bar and ask her if i could have the crown and coke for my friend, she says, \"yeah, sorry\" and goes back to her conversation. Five minutes later she returns and asks what we want to order. I order the bruchetta as an appetizer and lasagna for my main meal. My friend orders the chicken parmesan. The bruchetta arrives and is absolutely amazing. I like that the restaurant puts feta cheese in the bruchetta and the bread is soft, not hard like I've noticed in other restaurants. The main course arrives and my lasagna looks mouth watering. The sauce is sweet and the cheese is just melted to perfection. I believe it's the best lasagna I've had, other than my mom's, just in case she is reading this! We finish our meal, in which the bartender never never came over once to ask how it was and we wait for about fifteen minutes before she brings the check. I hand her my debit card and she brings me the receipt to sign. I notice the amount I signed for isn't the amount of the bill she brought over to me. I mention this to her and she realizes she ran my card for someone else's  bill. Wow, is all I can think at this point. She corrects the problem and brings me my bill. All in all, the service was terrible and the food was amazing. The question is, would I eat at this restaurant again? The answer is yes. I would request a different server, and hope for better service. I would recommend the food to everyone."}
{"text":"this place is hardcore overpriced. i would even beg to say the olive garden is tastier and cheaper.(for the record, i can enjoy the olive garden. the food quality matches the price)

 I have eaten here a few separate occassions and have been 100% disappointed each time. maybe i have high expectations or something. especially when each meal is right around $15. I think their food is worth closer to $8 per meal. I would probably give it higher stars if the price was right, actually because the food isn't bad at all. just lacking when you put into account the total of your bill.  like seriously, $15 for fettuccine alfredo? i don't think so. it better be flipping bomb pasta and alfredo for that price.   and the chicken? what in the world is that? frozen tyson pieces? it looks like blended up chicken put into the shape of grilled pieces. vom. 

i will say that the service is really friendly and I like the location. but those two things alone would not convince me to go back. sorry to say but it's true."}
{"text":"My family loves this place so we've been dining here for decades.  Even when I was a kid I knew it was mediocre at best.  After not being forced to dine here for several years I came (with the family of course) on a Sunday afternoon a few weeks ago.  The menu's changed since 1995 but the food and service are still sub par.

We started off with the spinach dip in a \"brioche\" bread bowl.  First of all, don't insult my intelligence.  I can tell the difference between brioche and a sourdough bread bowl from Safeway. This appetizer was reminiscent of something I would've brought to a potluck ten years ago. 

My sister got the lobster ravioli. Definitely a two star dish.  The sunrise sauce (creamy tomato sauce) was OK but the ravioli lacked any type of flavor - lobster or otherwise.

My brother got the penne quatro formaggio. This was actually the best thing on the menu but it was just glorified macaroni and cheese.  Don't try to trick us common Mesa folk with your fancy Italian. 

Mom got the spaghetti and meat sauce.  I didn't taste it because once I smelled it I didn't need to. Ugh.

I got the berry and candied walnut salad.  The spring mix was old and it was nothing special.  I was just going for the least disgusting and calorie laden item on the menu.  Mission accomplished. 
 
Service was unremarkable - drinks were refilled but she was MIA quite a bit.   

Eating here reminds me of Thanksgiving.  I know that I'll be with my family and I'll leave full but ultimately unsatisfied."}
{"text":"After years of driving by this place a few times a week, I finally found myself within its doors, late on a Friday night.  I had heard good things about it, and curiosity and opportunity combined to bring me here.

My first impression from looking at the menu: it's expensive.  But it wasn't overly expansive, so I figured they just offer the dishes they do well.  Not a bad thing at all.

The italian cream soda was delicious.  I also started with the clam chowder, which was decent.

For my entree, I ordered the salmon piccata, as I was in the mood for a good light meal.  They assured me that it would not be cooked well done, with a little bit of pink left in the middle... However, the fish was as cooked and dry as any salmon I've had, and I was basically eating a plate of lightly sauced noodles and bland fish.  I know I wasn't looking for something heavy, but if I'm enjoying the capers more than the actual fish, that means it's too bland.

The ambience is nice though, and it's really nice to have a place in this part of town that is open past 9PM, but all I can say about the food is, \"meh.\"  There is better, cheaper Italian food to be had in the Valley."}
{"text":"Love the food and service here. Just wish there was more parking during weekday lunchtime. Parking can get a little tight!"}
{"text":"Tyler was so amazing even tho it was a very busy Friday night. We loved everything about our experience and everyone made it amazing. We will continue to come back here."}
{"text":"Take out order:

Eggplant parmigiana- very good.
Meatball- burnt outside and dry. 
Side of garlic bread- stale with very little garlic butter.  Obviously hastily prepared.

Maybe the quality would have been better if I dined in?"}
{"text":"Okay, so maybe I should have rounded up on this one, but -- Vito's is a solid 3 1/2 stars!  Maybe even, 3 3/4 stars.

The three of us came here last night for dinner and had a really nice time.  We were seated promptly and the place was hopping.  The main dinning room had only two tables open (see photo) and the patio looked crowded as well.  

Our waitress Angela, came by almost immediately after we were seated to fill our water glasses and ask if we wanted anything to start off.  Nice!

After looking at the menus and wine list, we order the fried Calamari to start for $9.00.  Angela explained that the fried calamari was served with a dusting of garlic seasoning and buffalo dip (see photo), while their grilled calamari was serve more Cajun style.

The three of us ordered our own baseline entrees when eating in a Italian restaurant for the first time.  We ordered and shared:  Chicken Parmigiana with a side of penne pasta, $16.50; Penne Caprese, $15.00 and the Spaghettini, $11.00 with a side of Meatballs and Sausage, $2.00.  We also ordered the House Salads for $2.00 each. 

Angela returned after a few minutes with our Fried Calamari.  This was really good.  When ordering calamari, it is always a test for a kitchen to cook it right.  If you're busy and you cook it too long, it becomes very chewy.  Tonight it was perfect and melted in our mouths, with just the right amount of heat.  A nice start!

After finishing the calamari our salads arrive.  They were pretty straight forward -- iceberg lettuce, with some black pitted olives and cherry tomatoes.  When we were done, the plates were bused and we sat for a few minutes enjoying some good conversation.  Angela came by and refilled our water glasses and gave us an update on our meal.  In fact she came by several times during our dinner to check on things and to refill glasses.  

I only mention this because with non-chain restaurants the dining experience can be somewhat casual in nature.  This is done intentionally I'm told to create a sense of ambience for the diners.  It also means you sometimes don't see your wait staff as often.  Not here, Angela stayed on top of things!

Our dinner arrived and everything looked good.  The only mix-up was with the spaghettini which we ordered with a meat sauce.  It was served however with a marinara, or so we thought .  Angela offered to take it back to the kitchen and remake it, but we opted to remove the sauce and just get a bowl of meat sauce for our pasta.  That's where it became interesting, because that in fact was the meat sauce.  We only realized it after she brought out the new meat sauce which was the same as we had initially.

Okay, so the meat sauce isn't their strong suit.  We where thinking more bolognese and this was more sauce with a little meat in it.  Our error, but everything was good.  The Chicken Parmigiana had two pieces of breast meat that was breaded just right.  And, the Caprese pasta was flavored with a balsamic reduction sauce.  Nice.

Our bill, before taxes came to $65.75, which also included a glass of Chianti for $6.00.   We thought it was more then fair and the portions were generous.  We even had three take home boxes.

As we were leaving, we saw several thin crust pizzas go by for one of the larger groups and thought maybe next time.  We will definitely be back.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The pizza my bf ordered, the ranch dressing, and the service were the only good things.  The bad?  This place is very dated in the decor and the food they serve.  Also, the garlic cheese bread was bland, every other table got served a basket of bread but we did not, and the tortellini with sunrise sauce legit tasted like Chef Boyardee Spaghetti-Ohs.  I really don't enjoy tearing places apart like this unless someone was hella rude to me or something, but I felt sick after eating a few bites."}
{"text":"The place is so delicious!!  I ordered the chicken and spinach cannelloni and my husband ordered the sausages stuffed chicken; both were tasty.  The chicken dish was enough for two meals.  Love the bread with the pesto butter.  We also had a glass or two of wine!  Cute pace and our server Kim was amazing.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Very inattentive waiter. Had to ask for refills and placed our order with another waiter. Pizza was sub par - dry and not enough sauce and not really hot. Overall dining experience was disappointing. Talked to manager and he listened."}
{"text":"The food was wonderful and service great. Debra was attentive and friendly. We will definitely come again.   Try the sunrise sauce - awesome!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, mediocre food at best. One visit had decent service, the last was horrible and very unengaged server who messed up our order and didn't seem to care. Gave it three tries, won't go back - go elsewhere would be my recommendation."}
{"text":"We ordered the berry and candied walnut salad that was wonderful.  Some of the spring mix used was a bit black in parts but the taste of the other ingredients and dressing helped make up for it.  

The pizza was very reminiscent of the Midwest and made me think of home.  The cheese was good, a bit heavy on the green peppers but the sausage was very good.  I thought the dough however was bland and seemed overworked.  It was a bit dense, but not like Rosatis cracker like crust, perhaps because it was so bland.  

All in all, I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"This place is certainly a gem!  Gives you a very warm, traditional Italian feel and taste (or at least as perceived by a non-Italian).  The bread before dinner was on the plain side but I suspect that's how Italian bread is as Buca di Beppo's is the same.  They do give a flavorful pesto butter to enhance the dull bread.  The filet steak stroganoff was out of this world best I've ever had!!!  It was less creamy than typical and tasted more like a Marsala but not since they also have Marsala on their menu.  The sauce was truly amazing with mushrooms and the high quality and abundant tender steak chunks make it heaven.  This was supposed to be a shared dish with the husband but it didn't end up that way!  We also ordered pizza since most reviews seem to point to that as their specialty.  Pizza didn't disappoint but didn't impress either.  The crust was not the brick oven baked thin crust I prefer but was decent. It's the drier not oil-soaked kind but crispy and not dehydrating to the mouth.  We got the deluxe aka combo pizza and they do not skimp. The pizza was loaded and heavily weighed down with piles of sausage, pepperoni, and veges.  It would be even better if toppings were premium but they were just your typical ones.  Overall a wonderful experience and would have been five stars but pizza missing that little touch of magic."}
{"text":"We went there for dinner on Fri, nite. The waitress said the stuffed mushrooms were great. the sausage in them was cooked but the mushrooms were under cooked..... I had the chicken parm, i thought it was below average. My wife said my red sauce was 100 percent better, and i am not Italian.... I will not be going back any time soon.  We will go to streets of new york instead. Good luck if you go :("}
{"text":"Maybe it was growing pains, but the place has significantly improved. We've moved out of the neighborhood but continue to go back to Vito's. It's one of my son's favorite places for pizza, and my husband and I love the pesto sauce. They'll make things off the menu, if they have the ingredients. The staff (some of them) remember us, which makes us feel good and enjoy this neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Great tasting food! The free water served was good too. Kids meals were low priced and high quality. Dessert was super good. Great atmosphere. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A neighbor recommended Vito's to me & I was not disappointed! Great food, great prices & great service!"}
{"text":"It is cheap italian food, but friendly and fast. The baked ziti came out in 5 minutes which means all the stuff is cooked and just waiting to be served. The caesar salad was watery and not seasoned properly. The croutons were from a bag. Overall, save your money if you really enjoy true italian as this place is overpriced for the product."}
{"text":"It's a big menu. Calamari is done right, with good sauces. The pizza is thin crust, with high quality ingredients, including the cheese. Pastas and everything else is great. Great decor and service. The parking can be a little weird."}
{"text":"Best Happy Hour around.  Best staff.  It's a delight to go there.  Wait staff is superb and so is the food.  Dave A."}
{"text":"Coming from Chicago we are a little more critical about pizza. It wasn't bad, but it didn't impress me either I thought it was over priced. Now that Gino's East and Lou Malnati's are in Phoenix we can get GREAT pizza. Woo-hoo"}
{"text":"Great ambiance, staff and feel to this place! 

The food, on the other hand, was quite the opposite I must say. The set up is great; I've never been to Italy, and though I doubt this place is anything like it, I really felt like I was in an Italian restaurant in Sicily. Not really. The outdoor patio looked like a quaint place to dine. Subtle candle lighting, stone walls and patrons w/ red wine.. I was hoping a gondola would gently cruise by. But it didn't. We were in Arizona, sheesh! What was I thinking?!

Anyways, as mentioned, the place is well maintained and is very inviting. Our friendly host inquired where we were from, LA, and mentioned he was from Alhambra.. But I'm from the SGV.. I'm the only person supposed to be here from the SGV Foo! We were sat in a booth that barely sat our party of 4. I'm not big, nor were the people I was with.. With that being said, the table itself, too, was somewhat miniature. I was bumping elbows with my father basically the whole time and footsies with the family friend across from me. Mind you, my father is only around 5'7 and I'm 5'10. We're not big people, yet found ways to cross paths and graze one another more than once during our visit.

Our table ordered 4 salads and two pretty basic pizzas; Margarita and Pepperoni  (not to my choosing) *grunts. Can we get more generic?? I grabbed a Caesar which was appropriately made. Our pizza's arrived and both practically took up the entire table. I'm not sure what to expect when I get pizza.. it's not necessarily something I go out of my way for, and between 'NY' style and 'Chicago', I like both almost equally. Anyways, I suppose this was NY style because the crust was ultra thin. Not only was it thin, but it lacked lots of flavor. I mean.. with no seasoning and a paper thin crust, the toppings better be the best I've EVER had. ..And because we ordered the barest pizza's of them all, I can't say the pizza was great. Cheese was cheese and pepperoni's were a little greasy, which in turn, created a soggy center. Long story short, the pizza was pretty plain and kind of reminded me (no offense to the chef's / owner's) of microwave / frozen pizza. I actually added a grip of Parmesan for the sake of my taste buds. Aye Don Vito, wassa' happenin' back there?! 

With a fairly high price for a pizza pie that contained minimal flavors ..overall I feel the meal wasn't really worth it."}
{"text":"Yum!  Pizza is delish!  $1 glass of wine on Tuesdays w entree.  Love Vito's! Location in Mesa on McKellips & Lindsay is better than their Scottsdale location... not sure why????  Pizza is better that is.... but either way its good."}
{"text":"Delish! Great lunch had seafood lasagna, husband had Italian beef sandwich. Also, had a buy one get one coupon. Will go back. The Martini was good too. We will have to do happy hour next time."}
{"text":"Taste very good. It like most fast food chains , probably in top 5 pizzas places around"}
{"text":"Update to previous review:

The restaurant graciously heard my concerns and quickly resolved the situation. My second meal was excellent. Thank you!"}
{"text":"pizza is awsome !!! Service was great first time trying and I will be back . If you like great food a great atmosphere and good prices try this place"}
{"text":"well after the last disaster with trying to have a pizza delivered we decided to try this place again and picked the pizza up all i can say is the pizza really had no flavor i salted i peppered i chili flaked and those are not dance steps. I guess we have given this establishment the opportunity to be our neighborhood place but i Know I can make a better pizza at home all though i have added a star to there rating just for actually getting the order right"}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is always fresh and delicious. Chicago thin crust pizza. The wait staff is the best. From the front of the house to the chefs. You won't be sorry. I've been there many times since I moved to this area."}
{"text":"I am so impressed with the catering service that I received from Vito's. I didn't know what to expect in order to plan the wedding for my daughter, but Chelsea talked me through every step of the way. I highly recommend them as a go to for your catering needs. Just the best!"}
{"text":"How much would you pay for 4 small thin slices of chicken in their Chicken Piccata? I'll tell you this, not $19! They are the size of chicken nuggets
Needs seasoning terribly.

Pizza is ok. Chicken Parm is alright...but the grand total of $60 is NOT worth it!

We were ripped off!"}
{"text":"I was here for a weekend trip. My boss recommended Vito's pizza, it is well known locally. We were here around 3pm, still a few tables eating. Service was good. 

We ordered salad and a medium pizza to share. 

Mango Shrimp Salad - 3 pieces seasoned jumbo shrimp, shrimp was flavorful and fresh, loved the tangy fresh mangoes. 

Deluxe Pizza Medium $21.50 - pepperoni, sausage, olives, mushrooms, bell peppers and onions .... pizza were a little undercook, a little soggy in the center. For the price of the pizza, I would expect the pizza to cook right."}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent!  Happy hour everyday is awesome!  We always enjoy our visit to Vito's."}
{"text":"We miss the real Vito! The new owners have changed the business for the worst. Nothing tastes the same anymore. It's way over priced and just blah. Go back to the original recipes and specials please. I miss the good old days at Vito's."}
{"text":"We miss the real Vito! The new owners have changed the business for the worst. Nothing tastes the same anymore. It's way over priced and just blah. Go back to the original recipes and specials please. I miss the good old days at Vito's."}
{"text":"I bought a groupon for Vito's and my husband and I were out and decided to stop for a late lunch early dinner. It wasn't crowded I'm sure because of the hour so service was excellent. Anyway we ordered the Meat Lovers pizza.  It's a thin crust pizza which I love. It was Delicious.  There was plenty of meat and cheese and not too much sauce.  I don't care for a pizza drowning in sauce. It was cooked to perfection. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We ordered for pick up, as my wife was feeling tired and not feeling like going out. I ordered the linguini pescatore and it was great, I forgot what she ordered but I remember she was very happy as well.  We also ordered the cannoli for dessert and it was very good.  Overall the order was taken correctly, the food was ready when I got there.  I cannot speak for the dinning room experience other than it looked very nice, I will review that next time."}
{"text":"Amazing. This place is an old-school Italian restaurant. The only thing I've ever gotten here is Pizza but the rest of the menu looks great. 
Service is fantastic. Everybody there seems genuinely happy that you came in. Great Bar too."}
{"text":"Tasty little Italian joint tucked away in the Ancala area of Scottsdale. It's a cozy place to have a dinner with friends or family, and they have a good sized bar area suitable for grabbing a brewski and watching a ball game. However, it can get obnoxiously loud in the bar when they have live music...totally ruins the experience. Place is kept clean, and the waitstaff are very friendly."}
{"text":"In my review on June 11th, I informed that our server inadvertently charged us full price on our drinks.  To our pleasant surprise, we were contacted by the owners Ryan and Alexis and not only did they apologize for any misunderstanding, they explained what may have happened and kindly sent us a gift certificate as well.  This is outstanding customer service and only reinforces our already positive opinion of their restaurant.

Thank you Ryan and Alexis!  We look forward to visiting your restaurant in the near future."}
{"text":"We ate there last nite. Hubby got fettuccine Alfredo with jumbo shrimp. Yeah right. They were the size of my little finger. Maybe if they gave you a dozen you wouldn't be too unhappy  but there were only 5 of these little guys. I ordered spaghetti  and meatballs which was fair but no comparison to Carrabbas. So our dinners with 2 salads and soft drinks came to $51. We will  not be back."}
{"text":"Have been to Vito's for two dinners during the last week. The first night we split the chicken parmesan and then had cheesecake for dessert. The service was great and the food was excellent. We came back a few nights later. We were seated in an area where a large party was congregating as they were leaving. They took pictures, hugged and were incredibly noisy. The staff had to move around them crowding us even further. The pizza was okay. We will definitely try them again. The downside is the layout of the restaurant does not lend itself to a fine dining experience but the bill is pretty hefty."}
{"text":"Amazing service and great food. Price point is just right! We had an awesome time here with our work team."}
{"text":"Service was good but Spinato's across the street has nothing to worry about food wise. Bland luke warm pizza. Wife's soup was good. One time trip."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Pizza in Arizona. Being from back east it's hard to find good pizza here. This is some of the very best! Excellent service, great atmosphere. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is a good little neighborhood place for pizza and spaghetti with good deals. Do not go in and order anything except Italian specialties though.  Good house wine and a good price. Must sign up for the email offers. The pizza crust is thin and crispy which we love!"}
{"text":"Best margherita pizza I have found so far. The basil is great, tomatoes are ripe and wonderful and the crust is nice and thin. I can eat a medium by myself just because i like the taste so much. if you like pizza and capresse salads you will love this pizza Have to say for pizza it is better than oregano's and I like the atmosphere as you will often see Vito himself lending a hand.

I also like the cesar salad here as they give you anchovies on the side if you like and i happen to like anchovies on mine especially with a good quality sauce like they have here.

Oh the one time i had dessert here it was good too, don't remember what it was because it was a few months back but i remember it was a good end to the meal.

Can't speak on the rest of the menu but for pizza this place is a winner."}
{"text":"This place is great! My girlfriend loves the pizza. I prefer the chicken alfredo.  Family owned. Friendly staff. This has been here about a year and I just tried it this week for the first time.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice comfortable place for a local restaurant!  There is a variety of menu items and the atmosphere is quiet and quaint.  I would recommend this restaurant in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! I was surprised by the taste of the Chicago style pizza. Very impressed, will return for sure!"}
{"text":"Well, good food, good service, great specials. Not sure why it's not busier but we have never been disappointed. A good, local place."}
{"text":"Great Pizza and great service. Great for small groups or large groups. My wife say they have the best gluten free pizza crust anywhere in the valley. Been coming here since the 80's. Dining room is not noisy like other places."}
{"text":"Perfectly decent Italian food that gets multiple visits due to a general lack of Italian competition in the East Valley.  The pizzas are simple and tasty.  The crust is somewhat distinctive and is more like lavosh than the typical crust that most people have become accustomed to.  The seafood pasta was similar.  Simple and fairly tasty.  While none of our dishes have really exploded with flavor they do make good dishes that merit a return visit."}
{"text":"Vito's has ok Italian food. It is definitely not as good as I thought it would be . I have tried this place numerous times because it is near my house. I would recommend just getting the Issas if you go . Their pasta is nothing to write home about . On the pie we normally get  sunrise sauce , extra cheese, and half sausage . It is delicious but expensive . For two pizzas and limited toppings It will cost around 35-40 bucks. If you have room for dessert...don't forget to get a chocolate molten cake with vanilla ice cream. That was a star in itself."}
{"text":"We were there on Mothers Day. They were packed so they stuck us in the bar area. We were starving so we didn't mind. The service was incredible slow but the food was amazing! We will be trying this place out again!"}
{"text":"We went there with a Groupon, which the waitress took when she greeted us.  We ordered, and told the waitress we'd have two half price drinks that were the special of the day.  When the bill came, we had been charged full price for the drinks.  The explanation we were given was that we couldn't use the Groupon along with any other discount. The Groupon states it's for food only, therefore the discount on the drinks should have been okay. The manager was not accommodating, and demonstrated poor customer service. 
The food was overshadowed by this situation. 
There are many other Italian restaurants in the area that want our return business."}
{"text":"After having a bad experience here, the manager contacted me and apologized for a previous employee being rude and difficult. They provided me with a gift card to try the restaurant again and mailed it to me within a few days. It's very refreshing and surprising that good customer service still exists and that they actually treat you like they want your business. Will definitely be a regular here now."}
{"text":"Meat Lover's Pizza rocked!! Make sure and ask for Staci if dining in, she's da'bomb diggity when it comes to pleasant and attentive service, we simply won't go unless we call ahead and make sure she's there to wait on us."}
{"text":"This place had a great buffet for a retirement dinner.  Bar needs to be a little bigger"}
{"text":"Everything we've tried on the menu is fantastic and service is outstanding!  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Not bad at all. I love the square cut approach, it reminds me of back home. A place in San Jose called, Renato King of Pizza."}
{"text":"The food is amazing here and the dessert. We will most definitely be coming back. The chicken Alfredo was so good and of course we ended it with the blue berry cheese cake."}
{"text":"Really good food,  apparently this is a long time we'll known place.   Everything was exactly as it should be.  The ladies with me that had the tortellini loved it!"}
{"text":"Oh Vito's I have loved you for so many years! When I was in high school I used to go to Vito's for mushroom soup on Mondays. To my surprise, they still serve mushroom soup on Mondays and let's just say it's been a few years ; )   I have to be honest that I don't ever eat anything else there, just the mushroom soup.... Maybe I should check it out on a different day of the week next time."}
{"text":"I received a coupon in the mail so I thought, why not. If you like mediocre Italian and decent wine, this place is for you. It's nothing special. If I want great Italian, I'll go to Maggianos or Carrabas. The pizza and baked ziti weren't awful, but they weren't good. The service was good though. The server was helpful and attentive. It's always busy so I'm sure people will still flock there for a close Italian fix."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere. Manager talked with us since it was our first time to welcome us. Our waitress Jenna was fantastic."}
{"text":"our first foray for this seasons Restaurant Week. we made reservations for a mid-week feasting, but really didn't need to as there were plenty of seats.

google maps incorrectly places this location, and it's actually about 1/4 mile south of where google puts you. 

our service was pretty good....very friendly but missed out big time on the water glass re-fills. 

we chose Vito's because they had so many options for non-meat eaters for their restaurant week menu. and for 30 bucks, a great app, a great big entree, a delectable desert, and an alcoholic beverage. a great deal!

i started with the grilled shrimp al capone. 2 extra large grilled shrimp atop a home-made \"slaw\" (minus the mayo). it was very refreshing and filling...so much so i couldn't finish my entree!

entree was the seafood lasagna. it was a cheesy delectable-ness of seafood lasagna goodness. it was extremely rich and flavorful, full of seafood and cheese varieties. 

for desert, i had the chocolate chip bread pudding. it was warm, slighly gooey, slightly crispy, and all good! with a side of vanilla ice cream, i knew i was in for a sugar high before my inevitable slumber. 

excellent italian eatery and something on the menu for all palates!"}
{"text":"Basic, forgettable cuisine. I ordered an individual pizza and it looked like a frozen digiorno pizza that they nooked in the microwave for a few minutes. Really the only good thing we're their toasted raviolis. Even those were just okay. Also, who charges for ranch anymore these days? We got two sides of ranch not even thinking that they would charge us but what do you know, they showed up on the bill. Stupid. 

I will say that the service is really good and I would give them a 5 star based on service but unfortunately the food was not good. 

Way overpriced for subpar food."}
{"text":"We have lived in the area for many years and often drive right by this place.  We never stopped by to try it out until one day my family invited us to go out to lunch and picked this place.  We figured we would give it a shot.

We ordered a couple of pizzas and had the calamari for an appetizer.  The calamari with spices and dip was very good.  For the pizza, we created our own, by adding pepperoni and artichokes.  The pizza was delicious.  My family had ordered the buffalo chicken and we also tried that one.  It was great.  The service was great and the staff was very attentive. 

The meal was not cheap but I also don't think it was overpriced for the quality and portions.  Since our first meal, we have stopped by this place about 4 times and plan to continue going back.  Each of the following experiences was just as enjoyable as the first one.

The only issue we had was that taking home the pizza with certain \"wet\" ingredients like the artichoke hearts can make the pizza soggy in the fridge.  Taking home the buffalo pizza was not a problem.  

I highly recommend this place and only wish we had tried it sooner."}
{"text":"They told us it'd be 20 minutes and we waited about 40 only to be seated in the bar. They told us we'd have to be patient because the bartender, Alex, was running the bar and waiting all of the tables. Needless to say we were not expecting to enjoy our experience. But then we met Alex, the swiftest, speediest waiter I'd ever seen. He refilled my coke before I even realized I wanted a refill. Top notch service. Alex is the best."}
{"text":"I just felt that the calamari was bland.  The roast beef sandwich was too fatty and the au jus was too salty.  Tirimisu was deliscious though."}
{"text":"Simply disappointing.   The location is great, the decor is great, the whole ambience seems pretty good, so we were really optimistic about our meal, but it was utterly bland and disappointing. Most tables seemed to be ordering Pizza, and maybe that's where they excel, but when it comes to things like veal marsala, chicken picatta, etc, they seem to be only one step up from a microwaveable frozen dinner from the grocery store! 

Also, it seemed like there were very few Italian wines by the glass on the menu; I can't confirm that now as their wine list is not online, but I could swear there were no Chiantis, Montepulcianos, etc by the glass. 

With so many Italian options in the neighborhood, I don't think this place will survive."}
{"text":"Dinner last night at Vito's was incredible! The food was delicious, portions generous, staff welcoming, and our waiter Tyler was fantastic! We will definitely return often. 

He knew tips about the pizza - like letting us in on his \"pepperoni under the cheese\" secret which was DELICIOUS. I love that he was so knowledgeable about everything on the menu and that he could make lots of recommendations. He filled our drinks and we never had to wait -- and everyone was so happy! It was amazing to see all the staff smiling and happy... it must be an amazing place to work! 

We loved how clean it was -- not even fingerprints on the tile."}
{"text":"I am gluten free and they have the best gluten free menu I have seen in Mesa thus far!! I have only tried the gluten free pizza, but is by far the best gluten free pizza I have tried!!! They have gluten free salads, pasta and pizza. I will be going back :)"}
{"text":"Pretty average food, taste ok. You could tell nothing is prepared fresh. Nothing special here. Just ok . Service was very good."}
{"text":"The apple-fig brie appetizer was very very good. 

The meat pizza (sausage, pepperoni, meatball) on the other hand was very blah I actually had to salt it. The crust had no flavor. If you do not like fennel then don't order the sausage. 

We will go back to try the pasta but never order pizza again."}
{"text":"Vito, you have it figured out.   A nice repertoire of Italian faves, an explosion of seating options, fab espresso & extensive wine list, charming waitstaff, & Moretti Rosso.    I adore your sunrise sauce atop your homemade ravioli's and minus the chilled tomatoes in my insalata d'caprese, it was also delicious.    Totally acciented upon this gem while  lost in the desert and on my way back from Superstition Mountain, I landed here.   Mike, was the most well-oiled waiter machine I've ever met.   We came, we ate, we conquered - oh no, actually I guess Vito's conquered us.   Delicious."}
{"text":"Well, I've had mixed results at Vito's on FLW. 

Several months ago, some friends from the gym and I met there for lunch. The food was good, but not stellar. The service was fine. There were not many people present on a weekday lunch time so it wasn't particularly challenging. None of us had alcoholic beverages. I had pizza and it was pretty good.

But last night my wife and I went there with another couple. My friend ordered a drink and requested a specific brand of scotch. The waiter didn't understand the concept of ordering a call drink, and thought my friend wanted Dewars INSTEAD of the drink he ordered. 

When my friend asked to substitute sausage for meatballs, the waiter seemed incapable of (or unwilling to) make any changes. After pushing for a while, we finally convinced him to go ask if this substitution would be OK, and he came back and said it was. Why didn't he respond to the request with \"Sure!\" or at worst \"I don't know, let me go check for you.\"

He totally ignored us after serving the food, never checking back, and making it difficult to flag him down for some bread (which should have been offered without us asking). 

Our food was good, but not great. And it was warm, but not piping hot as it should be when delivered to the table.

We won't go back."}
{"text":"A large group of us went to our Christmas lunch here today.  The food was fantastic, and the service was amazing!  Would recommend this restaurant in a heartbeat.  I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The Bacon wrapped dates filled with cream cheese was Amazing!!! Seafood Au Gratin was good but little rich & extremely filling. Definitely dish to split with someone."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times, both in the dining room and for carry out and I have never had a bad meal or experience here.  I do think it is a little pricey for what you get (a large pizza with a couple ingredients runs about $20), but I don't mind so much because the food has always been very good.  This place is popular during spring training and always crowded - bring in a Cubs ticket stub and they offer a free appetizer plate with garlic bread, cheese sticks and something else I forget.  It's also popular among the senior crowd (my parents LOVE it here) and we always go early before the dinner rush.

Tonight was the first time I've had the pizza and I can't believe it took me so long.  YUM!  I haven't eaten much pizza since I've been here, but this is easily the best I've had so far.  I had an email coupon for buy one pizza get one free, so my Mom and her husband I went for dinner tonight.  We had a margherita pizza that was a good balance of cheese and sauce, I wish there were more fresh basil on top though.  Add a little crushed red pepper and my mouth was happy!  The other pizza we had was black olive, 1/2 sausage and 1/2 pepperoni.  Not bad, my Mom and her husband loved it, but I thought the margherita was much better.  I'm also a fan of their sunrise sauce, an alfredo sauce with a light touch of tomato.

It does get loud in the restaurant, this isn't the place for a quiet dinner.  They have an enclosed outside seating area but it looks right onto the parking lot.  I just noticed tonight that they now have a drive thru for carry-out orders, so that is very convenient because the parking lot gets full early."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Amazing food, amazing service. The vegetarian pizza is the best I've ever had, I highly recommend it. There was a bit of a wait, but it was absolutely worth it considering the quality of the food and the atmosphere. Tasha was our server and she made mine and my family's dining experience so much better with her hospitality and humor. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Hands down best thin crust Chicago style pizza in the state. I know this is a bold statement but I drive 45 minutes once a month to visit this hidden jewel. I mainly stick to the pizza  but if you want a change of pace they have pretty good pasta and chicken dishes. However, if you are a first timer it is imperative that you order pizza because you will be hooked. 

Vito is a very nice man and is often seen at the restaurant. He is proud of his hertitage and brings to the restaurant to create and warm and comfortable atmosphere. 

I just updated this to 5 stars because the new location is opening in Scottsdale the end of July or early August 2011."}
{"text":"Can always count on quality great tasting food. Their pizza is one of the best, if not the best, in the Valley. Thin & crispy. Cut in squares. My family has been coming here or ordering delivery since 1994. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have been going here  since we moved a mile away almost two years ago. The food is excellent!!! Even the take out and delivery are great!!!! From the pizza to the pasta you will not be disappointed. They also have gluten free menu."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this place. This is the first restaurant that my husband and I found for me to eat at after I was forced to become gluten free 1 1/2 years ago. Their gluten free menu is extensive, not like some restaurants that only have 2 or 3 items. Their gluten free margarita pizza with fresh basil is to die for. We've eaten here several times and everything we've tried has been excellent. We're glad we only have to drive across Mesa for great Italian food and I'm especially grateful that I don't have to give up my favorite kind of food due to my medical issues."}
{"text":"We've been going to this restaurant and over time it has really gotten better.  The service is very friendly and the happy hour food is awesome.  The prices are good and portions reasonable.  I am happy to report that my evaluation has gone up.  I am and east coast girl with very high Italian Food standard so I can't go to 5 stars unless the Pizza drips oil down my arm as I fold the slice to take a bite! The pizza is decent but not NY decent LOL. Give the place a try, you will like it."}
{"text":"We order pizza and food quite often have it brought to our business but the driver does not seem to care enough to take care of the food as he is delivering it always seems to show up mangled."}
{"text":"We made reservations on Friday night for 12 people at 7pm. We were seated immediately and greeted by the manager, Giselle, who was very welcoming and friendly. After explaining the specials to us she said she'd be back with some treats for us. We were delighted to have three trays of bruschetta and garlic bread served complimentary to our group. All were delicious! Our group ordered a variety of pizzas, lasagna, salads, and steak. Every single meal was fabulous! We will definitely be back and recommend Vito's to our friends and family! Thanks for an awesome dining experience!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came tonight for a date night. Everything was great Deborah was our server she was very knowledgeable,  friendly and attentive. I ordered  the seafood au gratin my husband ordered the linguine pescatori. We also got the calamari and traditional bruschetta. My husband is Italian so has always Been very critical about Italian restaurants so I was glad to know that he loved it here! Everything Was Awesome we are definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"OK, so this isn't in my neighborhood... but it used to be. I grew up down the road and spent many a date, night after the football game, and lunch with the girlfriends here. Wonderful food and even better service. Has lots of room for groups for special events. The pasta dishes are all good and I love the antipasta salad. Try the goat cheese and artichoke pizza for a change."}
{"text":"Went last night for Birthday dinner for my daughter. We have been coming here for over 20 years but sadly we haven't been in several years. Very busy but very good service. Had a table for 6, Vito's takes great pride in preparing a great pizza. Their crust is one of the best, not soggy at all. Very crisp crust  and plenty of toppings on top. Ordered with extra cheese and still was cooked to perfection. Owner came over twice to insure everything was done to our satisfaction, We will be back soon, great place, I wish I could say the same thing about my daughter's boyfriend. Thanks Vito's!!!!!"}
{"text":"Eh, not impressed. There was nothing about this place that made it seem unique or interesting. I was joking with my dad that it looks like they went to italianrestaurantdecor.com to furnish the restaurant. Pretty dead on a Tuesday night even with a wine special advertised. Super overpriced as well. $25 per person for a mediocre entree and an iced tea. Maybe if I had taken advantage of the wine special it would have made the food, and the bill, more palatable."}
{"text":"They accommodated our party of 36 at the last minute on a Saturday evening! Food was delicious. Our party had ordered pizzas, pastas, appetizers -calamari, bruschetta, and mixed drinks and beer. Everything was great, service was outstanding! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Vitos is very good, they have a great happy hour in the bar and on the patio. Our food was excellent, we had the seafood gratin pasta and the brie apple appetizer. The first time we went and ordered the grilled calamari, it was too spicy to eat, had it been less spicy it would have been amazing. The kids meal was surprisingly good, a nice portion of mac and cheese and side of grapes, strawberries, and apples. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent this restaurant.  We have both liked everything we have tried.  We actually are careful to not go here too much!  Make a reservation on weekend evenings, because it's always crowded - and for good reason!  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"I recently bought a groupon for Vito's and went last night.  Oh my!! That place is yummy!!  I'm so happy to have discovered it.  I will be back!!  The artichoke spinach dip appetizer was to die for.  I also had a side salad that was good- nothing special, just a regular side salad.  I also had the thin crust pizza.  So good!  Our server was on top of things and we never waited for anything.  I'm so happy to have found this place."}
{"text":"Great family place and wonderful home Italian cooking. Had Olive Garden on Friday and Vito's in Saturday. Vito's wins hands down. My husband owes me a car wash! Woo hoo"}
{"text":"AMAZING Calamari.  THis place makes some great soup and I just love the pizza sausage and sauce on the pizza.  I would like to see the crust changed....I would like it more like a Chicago thin crust.  Overall, we liked this place a lot and the lunch prices were great."}
{"text":"I love tis place-- the food is great and so is the service-- management is very attentive to customer needs.  Love, love, love them.    (I'm from Chicago and i had a really hard time finding good pizza when we moved to AZ--  but I love Vito's)    I've also had the toasted ravioli, sandwiches, and pasta dishes-- never a disappointment!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Our waitress Ashley was awesome. Their meatballs are great. I love their blackened Salmon and lasagna. I have never had something here I didn't like. Amazing food, Awesome service!"}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I have been here. I think the quality has improved. The Soup was fresh. Chicken Apple salad was very good too.great service"}
{"text":"Our first try at an Italian restaurant in our new neighborhood and unfortunately, not my favorite.  Homey and old school Italian feel with a friendly bar that might be fun to hang out at, though.  

The food however was what I would call American Italian and nothing to sing about.  We ordered Eggplant Parmesan and I found the eggplant to be a bit spongy - which is a no-no for me.  My Chicken Piccata was swimming in sauce and the Caesar salad dressing was nothing special.  

Service was gracious and quick.  Unfortunately not a winner for me though."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I am surprised its not 5 stars because i have always had 5 star experiences. Their Pizza is awesome. I love the pasta as well. I have picked up and ate inside its always really good. I love its like chicago with the square cuts."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Came here for lunch today and ordered the blackened salmon since I know I love it (had it a couple times here). It's the best salmon I've had at a restaurant, so flavorful and perfectly cooked. It comes with risotto, garlic bread and roasted veggies which are all equally amazing. The price is good too especially for the size - I have lunch for tomorrow! The restaurant is decorated so cute and it's got a nice patio area. The thin crust pizza is another dish to try, even the salads are tasty!"}
{"text":"We found this place because of groupon.  Started with Minestrone soup and husband had their Caesar salad.  I found the soup to be outstanding and hubby liked the salad.  He had the Mascarpone pizza and it was over the top good.  I order spaghetti and meatballs very delish.  The portions are huge.  Will be returning"}
{"text":"I am amazed about the complaints. I attempted to read their reviews, but they droned on so long I started to watch a commercial. Delicious food and great service. Vincent and Lori are like family. If you want free food stand on the corner with a sign that says \"I want free food\"."}
{"text":"Holy Moley!! This place is amazing! Try the pizza rolls, fried rav's and artichoke dip...TO DUE FOR! And their customer service is amazing!  Jamal was the sweetest waiter ever!! His recommendation of the dates and white sangria..SPOT ON!"}
{"text":"Once again Groupon has come through in the clutch and has introduced a great restaurant to us.  Back in the Summer, I bought a couple of Groupons for this place.  Since then, we've been back several times.  Below is a highlight of what we've had:

By far, my favorite dishes out of the bunch are the Stuffed Pizza Rolls, Quattro Formaggio Pasta, and the Pizza.  The Stuffed Pizza Rolls are unlike anything I've ever had....they're like little Pizza Burritos.  

I get the personal sized Pizza on occasion and it's just the right size for my appetite.  I get it well done.  They serve it on a little rack so the Crust doesn't get soggy....genius!

The Quattro Formaggio Pasta is what I get when I'm super hungry....it's very rich and filling.  Unless you bring a big appetite, plan to bring home a box if you order this dish.

The servers here are super nice.  They remember us and know that we enjoy a glass of Wine or 4 when we have dinner, so they offer up a glass immediately.  One server already knows and brings out the glass when she greets us....oh yeah!

{"text":"Listen up. You want Italian food? You want pizza? This is where you get it. Don't make things so complicated.

Yeah, the service is extra primo awesome. What else is new? These people are tops, and they're gonna treat you that way too. They been doin' it for decades.

But it's the food, you know. There's just nothin' like it in the valley. Can't go wrong. There're no missteps you can make at Vito's. Like I said, knockin' it outa tha park for decades.

You're gonna leave happy. But you gotta decide to put your butt in a seat. Waddaya waitin' for?

My favorites are:
Starters
  Coconut Shrimp or maybe some Minestrone
  The Garden and the Crisp Apple Salads are to die for
  My wife and daughter love the Caesar 
Mains
  The Pizza of course
  Chicken Parmisiana - I gotta struggle not to order it EVERY SINGLE TIME
  Oh, and the Lasagna and the Marsalas, just anything off the Pasta menu
  
You got a big group? Ask to be seated in the Wine Cellar. It's nice down there.

Happy Hour is awesome, and just what you need after a rough day in the coal mines or shakin that lousy brother-in-law down for the money he owes ya. 

Be good to yourself. You deserve it.

Tell 'em Dale sent you. And when they say: Who? Just say: Waddaya got on tap?"}
{"text":"Great pizza and ... Delivery!!  Boneless wings...not so good :(  And, think you need to stay with the regular, thin crust vs the dbl crust."}
{"text":"Food is always very good. Cannot go wrong with their pizzas and usually they have a special pizza which has never failed either. Great pasta dishes, as well as sandwiches & soups. 

Service is hit and miss. I eat lunch here often and sometimes my waitress seems to forget about me and other times she is very attentive to my 1 hour time frame. 

The atmosphere is okay, It can be very loud during lunch and parts of the restaurant are dark and secluded."}
{"text":"This place is yummy! Calzoni was super good (although I wish the crust came with a little more flavor) other than that it's really delicious. I had mushroom and Italian sausage in mine. They do give our free bread once. Environment was good too. A really good place for a cute Friday date night. Will come again!"}
{"text":"Updating with one additional star because Vito's did get back with us to try and address our concern."}
{"text":"Vito's is the best. It's not your normal pizza place - It's a high end Italian restaurant that has the best pizza and wings in AZ - honestly. Their bbq chicken pizza, Tuscan salad and baked wings are incredible. Every time I'm in Scottsdale and Mesa I stop to eat there. I can't wait for Gilbert to open!"}
{"text":"Great classic Italian restaurant! Owners dine there often themselves! Food is wonderful, and atmosphere is homey and inviting!"}
{"text":"Vito's is the best best in home cooked Italian food! I had my Birthday there with a party of 25 and they really made it a great one! They have 2 locations one in Mesa and the other in Scottsdale .. they are passionate in creating family style meals that are always fresh, I really feel like part of there family! Customer service was outstanding! Also if you become a member you will receive discount on wine as well as many other things .best pizza and Italian Restaurants in Scottsdale, AZ - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.
Had appetizers, pizza,soup and awesome pizza. Highly recommended.
Fair prices."}
{"text":"I go with my family to Vito's several times a year when I visit Arizona.  The hospitality in the restaurant is fantastic. The Owner, hosts and Managers are all very accommodating. Come early, like really early. The restaurant at dinner  fills up fast (by 530) and there could be an extended wait.  Service is very very slow. Only reservations for parties of 8 or more. 

On to the food.  Last visit was this past Saturday night. Went for our usual thin crust Chicago Style Pizza.  Ordered the 3 appetizer combo, zucchini, mushrooms & mozzarella. The appetizers took forever and they were nothing special, standard pre-frozen junk food tossed in the deep fryer. Eh. for $8.99. I'll skip those next time.   The Pizza.... Ah... The pizza... the only pizza I can actually eat the next day right out of the fridge!  Its got a delicate thin crust and just the right amount of toppings under the cheese, Chicago style and the good Italian pork sausage (not crappy breakfast sausage like they put on most pizzas in southern California) . The bad part, We ordered two MEDIUM's one was all Sausage, Mushroom & Sun dried Tomato. The second was Vegetarian, Spinach Mushroom & Artichoke.  The bill came and they charged us for Two cheese pizzas, then they charged us $2.00 per topping on both pizzas. They charged $3.75 for the sun dried tomatoes! I was a bit pissed off as the bill came to $69 for two pizzas and one appetizer and 5 sodas & iced tea.  I was paying for the entire group so I didn't want to make a big deal about it but next time I will ask.. are the ingredients going to be charged per ingredient? Best to stick with their offerings on the prearranged pizzas.  Seriously I paid about $29.75 just for ONE MEDIUM  cheese & sausage pizza!  BTW.. the $69 bill did not include the tip. Which I shorted because  the server could have been good enough to tell us how she was going to charge that or suggest we purchase the prearranged pizzas.  I gave it 4 stars for the pizza & restaurant hospitality. Service is 2 star at best due to the slow servers, who don't know how to make suggestions to their customers. 
Servers Listen Up:  You will actually get a bigger tip if you save me money on my meal. If you gouge me on the check your are going to be gouged on your tip. (see my review for Think Prime, San Pedro, CA)"}
{"text":"Seafood lasagna and stuffed mushrooms were delicious as was the fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp. Blueberry cheesecake topped off the excellent service!"}
{"text":"Not super impressed with this restaurant, but not repulsed either. The building/décor is very cute, and humble. The service is quick & we didn't have any issues with our waitress. The food was tasty, but cold & small portions for the price. That's what lost me, the pasta I ordered was good, but not GREAT. It reminded me of something you'd find premade & frozen at any Walmart. I didn't understand all of  the \"authentic Italian\" hype that I read, I'd honestly rather have Olive Garden...And, Olive Garden isn't even that great. Needless to say, I wouldn't recommend Vito's."}
{"text":"Another great find thanks to Groupon. Excellent service. Individual pizza more than enough for one person and good crust - not so thin that it breaks when you bite into it. Sunrise sauce very good. Just tastes homemade.  Nice atmosphere and very fast service. Will be back"}
{"text":"I would have given them 4 1/2 if I could. It would have been 5 if my waiter brought me the strawberry cheesecake I asked for but he brought cherry cheesecake, which was good but not what I ordered. I also had the seafood lasagna which was delicious! Seriously good food. And I loved the Sarsaparilla!"}
{"text":"Came in by coincidence. So happy that I came in. Their pizza was awesome. Was the best I've had? No but it definitely worth the price. A must try!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I have been going to Vitos for the last 3 years. We love Vitos!! Being from California I'm used to really good good Italian food or any food for that matter.  Besides the chain locations I couldn't find anything that was tasty enough to spend ridiculous amounts of money and not be satisfied. Not with Vitos everything we try we love.  The pizzas are to die for.  I have a lobster ravioli with sunrise sauce  and a few slices of my fiancé's pizza. Yummmmmmy !!! The herb bread and herb butter will get you hooked so be careful."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight with 6 friends. Service was awful. ... 2 hours. We all had one drink, no appetizers, ordered right after the drinks came. Never saw the server after he delivered the food. Didn't check back with us on food quality, no water or drink refills. One gals food was cold ... we complained and the manager came over & seemed very annoyed with us. Ordered dessert .... took forever ... we almost left. This restaurant needs better management and either more servers, or better training for them. When you have such a bad experience with the service, you don't even remember if the food was any good."}
{"text":"Good pizza and reasonably priced.  The dining room could use some updating, service is generally good."}
{"text":"Love this place... always take visitors here, just like we did that past Tuesday night! We had tortellini sunrise, chicken marsala (x2) and chicken cannelloni... everyone raved about their dishes! I have been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. I LOVE VITOS!!"}
{"text":"Prices were a bit up there considering the sizes that they offer, but overall very delicious pizza, I could taste fresh ingredients that are sometimes being lacked at other pizza places."}
{"text":"My wife and I sat in the bar area because it was a busy Friday night and we love to sit near the bar. There was absolutely no music which made for a very loud drunken ambience. I can't remember the last restaurant I've been to where there wasn't some background music, super uncomfortable. We ordered small starter salads which were delicious and well portioned. Unfortunately, the pizza we shared tasted EXACTLY like digiorno! I swear they baked a frozen pizza from the safe way down the street. Anyway, not the best experience and definitely not going back. Shame since it is right down the street from our house."}
{"text":"Stay away this is not pizza or Italian . We ordered meaty pizza . It was really not pizza , raaw dough cheese that slid off . The chicken parmigiana was a greasy sliver of very fried chicken that tasted like oil with over cooked pasta . Live in the area so thought why not . Not sure how this place exists"}
{"text":"New to town and wanted Italian. It was great! The eggplant parmigiana is wonderful. My parents enjoyed their Caesar salads and fettuccine Alfredo. We got take out but hope to dine there soon, although they were busy! Of course it was Saturday night. But a busy place must prove popularity."}
{"text":"Our group of 12 dined here for the first time last night. I did not speak to everyone about their meals but 8 of us had very negative experiences. I ordered Penne Caprese which was so bland I ended up eating just the chicken and leaving behind the penne and what little fresh mozzarella there was in the bowl. There was very little balsamic in the dish that I ended up tossing a lot of salt on the meal just to give it some flavor. Two of our guests ordered dishes with blackened shrimp which was so spicy that one guest claimed her mouth was literally burnt. My husband's lasagna arrived cold.  Unfortunately our waitress did not return to our table to check on us until we were finished.  We all felt the prices were extremely high for the meals we received.   My husband and I ordered two glasses of wine, $32!  The bread on the table was also very bland and tasteless.  Based on our conversations many of us would not return."}
{"text":"Holy amazing lunch! Walk in and get seated quickly. Vito's is a nice dining treat and getting seated quickly is great. The waitress collected our drink order and promptly gets the lunch order into the kitchen. Before we know it amazing appetizer and salads are our hot and fresh. Several minutes later entrees are on the table and bam a excellent full fledge food baby is born! You must try the chicken roasted pepper soup. By far the best I've ever had. Salads are crisp and fresh. Sausage sandwich was huge. Amazing service, fresh food and great ambience. What more could you ask for in a lunch or dinner spot!"}
{"text":"Good little place and has above par take out pizza. If you live in the neighborhood you should definitely check it out. The portions are a bit small and I would have given them 4 stars if they hadn't raised their HH prices. While the interior is very nice, it is not a good place to catch the game; very quiet and intimate. The staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"This is the best Italian food I've had to date in Scottsdale. Six of us went for dinner and everyone loved their meal. The service was great, as well. We loved it so much that we had dinner delivered the next evening.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I went back recently and it seems the sauce has changed. The food was okay and nothing to write home about this time. I probably wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"I love the margherita pizza here!! Right amount of sauce, chunks of mozzarella cheese, and big leaves of basil! Delicious, hot, perfect!!! They get their bread from the Breadsmith off Power and McDowell. Its great!!! They have great wine, pizza, drinks and desserts! Come check out this adorable place! There is a wait on the weekends so try and get in early on the weekdays!! Their cappuccinos are delicious with some decent tiramsu! Enjoy!!!

To bad they don't deliver!!!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Italian in the valley. I went tonight and tried the Salami Bruschetta, Lobster Ravioli, two different meat pizzas, a cannoli, and the tiramisu. I highly recommend them all!"}
{"text":"Extremely kind and service oriented staff with Good food to boot. 
Very good Italian food with generous portions. This is a local favorite for the North Mesa residence as you will see as the place is always busy. Never a long wait as they have plenty of seating and super friendly staff that does their best to get you seated and eating ASAP.
The food is good not the best Italian in the valley but defiantly good quality and you will not be disappointed. Their second location in Scottsdale is an amazing location and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Still the best pizza in town!
Chicken Piccata was fabulous with plenty of lemon caper sauce-just delicious!
Service is always top drawer!  Steve did a great job and answered all of our questions about their comedy club."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had lunch on Friday and it was quite nice.  The service was very good.....especially since the bartender was also our server!  But boy did the drinks come quickly! :)  But she was a great server overall.  The food is good; I've only been 3 times but it seems to be kind of hit or miss.  My daughter had a very good Penne pasta with balsamic glaze.  I had the berry salad which was lacking in berries, cheese and walnuts but lots of chicken!  Garlic bread is very good, not overpowering and crispy.  We will continue to go but it's not our go to place.  Definitely try it though!"}
{"text":"We went to the bar for happy hour...ohhh...my....goodness..what a deal!! We enjoyed some chicken/without the bones wing things...very good...some bruschetta and a pomegranate martini. Delicious! Our waitress Kiara was fantastic and very attentive. Made new friends with the couple that sat, next to us, sat and enjoyed a wee lil bit of basketball and visited with them and the staff...was a slow night...we had a grand ole time. We will be back! Gotta try the macaroni and cheese."}
{"text":"Bad bland food looks like it can out of a can from Sysco restaurant supply"}
{"text":"My husband and I often go there for quick lunch dates. I am a FAN of their creamy risotto. As a side to mussels or adding shrimp, it makes a delicious and filling lunch option. The service is consistently good there. Love the deals for each day of the week!"}
{"text":"We got take-out from Vito's tonight and I would have to say the food is good. The food was ready within 20 minutes so they are speedy. We ordered a large pepperoni pizza, wings, and kids spaghetti. The pizza was thin crust and very crispy. Often times we get \"thin crust\" and it's soft crust which we don't like. It came loaded with toppings and a good amount of cheese and sauce. The over all taste is good and acceptable but not spectacular. We also got the spicy flavored wings. Don't call them buffalo however as they will tell you they don't have buffalo wings. Their \"spicy\" flavor is very close to what a buffalo sauce should be. They are baked wings, but still crispy. Not soggy at all. I really really liked the wings!. On the spaghetti order, the noodles were a bit dry, but the meat sauce that accompanied it was good. This was the kid's menu item and it was a huge portion. If I could give Vito's 3.5 stars I would, so I will have to settle for 3 because I don't think it warrants giving a 4, especially since I couldn't use my groupon for take-out, and because the person on the phone taking my order was very corrective in my usage of wording for buffalo wings (not nice!). I also felt that $34 for the above 3 items was a tad on the pricey side, especially since I picked up the order myself. We will try Vito's again but this time dine-in and try different menu items."}
{"text":"$40 dollars for Sauce, Dough, Cheese, and Sausage?  Give me a break.  My wife and I go out often.  This was the worst service I have received in years.  Over priced hole in the wall pizza joint.  We heard good things, we were not sure what people see in this place.  Not for us."}
{"text":"I would like to thank Vito's manager for contacting me. My family really likes your food, we will be placing a to go order soon."}
{"text":"Small place but excellent food.
We have tried tortellini sunrise, chicken Marsala and breaded ravioli. At the table, our friends tried chicken Parmesan and salmon.

All the items were really good, the service was really good, very polite and friendly staff"}
{"text":"I love Vito's. My boyfriend and I actually come here a few times a week. They have great hot wings (the baked ones are fabulous), great pizza (get the goat cheese as a topping- it's amazing), and a very accommodating gluten free menu. They serve wine by the glass and Monday is all day happy hour! Their grape appletini is really stong but very tasty :) You definitely get your money's worth and the staff are all very nice. Try this place for the pizza, wings and wine and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Tried ordering for take out three of our requests from older menu they didn't have, including Minnestroni soup.  Then ordered two salads on bogo, when I went to pick them.... salads did not count for bogo, as they did not contain meat.  That was NOT on mailed coupon.  I complained, but did. Or care.  I will NEVER go back and I will tell all that I know about their treatment."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a year now. I don't think I ever gave Vito's a review but they deserve praise.
The calamari is to die for!!!!! You will not find better calamari ever. I have been to some of the finest dining places in the nation (ranging from French Laundry, 3 Forks and the Pearl in Miami) and in Europe. Please believe me when I say they have the Best Calamari. Everything is excellent there but the Seafood Lasagne is my favorite, incredible! To top it all off, their server Steven is the man that made my husband and I keep going back (personality and excellent performance). He is so respectful and prompt that we request his table each and every time. His charisma, smile and helpfulness is beyond perfect. I hope the owner knows what an asset this man is to their business. All the servers are great there, but Steven is the Superb. For a enjoyable Italian dining experience in all of Arizona go to Vito's in Mesa and ask for Steven....you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Omg I love this place!!! I am very picky when it comes to food especially Italian food. My friend recommended this place I said ok I'll check it out.  Well tonight was amazing!  The waiter and hostess was absolutely wonderful nice people!  Then come to our food start the two appetizers meatballs sliders amazing and ahi tuna bruschetta was awesome!  Then come to our dinner my was linguine seafood with red sauce was amazing I chow that boy down so fast omg I'm so full!  My hubby got sausage peppers rigatoni he said that was amazing too!! So glad I can put another restaurant into my go to list.  Love the people they're the best!!!!  When it come to food  and the people that serve you make a lot different!  Thank you for making my evening wonderful VITOS!!!"}
{"text":"We recently had a private luncheon event at Vito's after my mother's memorial service. (She always liked their food.) The staff could not have been more compassionate or gracious. Paul LaMarca, the general manager, made it as easy as possible for us to make the arrangements and his suggestions were spot on. Everyone LOVED the food, and this was a group of Italians who knows their Italian cuisine! Paul let us occupy the entire dining room for all of a Saturday afternoon and it was a perfect comfortable setting to spend time talking, remembering, eating and drinking. The chicken parm, pastas, salad and wines were all delicious. They even made more cannolis on the spot when our crew wolfed down the first tray in no time. (We really should've given them fair warning what they were dealing with!) Bravo Vito's for a job well done! We very much appreciated your excellent service."}
{"text":"I have lived in Phoenix for 24 years and never knew about Vitos. This is a happenin place. Excellent food, good outdoor dining when it isnt hot. I will go back again."}
{"text":"I like that they take reservations, especially through Open Table on Yelp.   I've been twice and the food has been great.  The marinara sauce is tangy.  The cream sauce is delicious.  The service is attentive.  I look forward to having a regular Italian restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The service was awful. Portions for price is small.  Felt rushed from the moment we sat down.  Food lacked flavor, needed salt.  Sent dish back because of the flavor.  Manager never came to ask any questions.  Will not return.  You can keep your buy one get one entree.  Not with it!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed this same restaurant in Mesa and just noticed that they had opened one in Scottsdale. 

The place was packed and arriving at 6:00 PM we were able to be seated immediately. Ten or fifteen minutes later, we would have been waiting. Our waitress was friendly. You could see the manager walking around seeing that everything was going okay, but I don't think she ever visited a table to see how her patrons were doing.

My wife had the Margherita Pizza and a salad and I had the Linguini Pescatore. 

The pizza was good along with her garden salad. My linguini was fabulous. The mussels were like muscles. I had a choice of Red or White sauce, so I chose Red. When I was finished, I used the bread to wipe my bowl clean. It was so good."}
{"text":"Had lunch with one of my colleagues on a Wednesday afternoon. Not crowded at 11:30, but after 12 Noon there were more patrons coming in.

I could not believe the size of the sandwiches. My friend ordered the Meatball Sandwich and a side of red potatoes. I had the Italian Combo with fruit. WOW, they both were huge and I finished mine and my friend took half the sandwich home.

The bread was super fresh. Service was okay."}
{"text":"Despite how busy they were, we were attended to immediately. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The bruschetta was the best I've ever had and the pizza was excellent. I definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic place.  We came on a Tuesday when a bottle of wine is 1/2 PRICE with a purchase of two entrees or 16\" pizza.  We are from the East Coast and are a custom to New Haven and New York  Pizza.  This pizza is very good it's not Abates or Pepes but darn close. My husband thought the pizza was a little greasy.  we had the Calamari and shrimp appetizers.  OMG!!!!   love it will come again when back in Mesa.  Vito's is truly a real Italian restaurant and not a knock off.  Also to note are the reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This is a very nice family Italian restaurant. We went here after another place was packed with people. Vito's was also full, but the manager rushed forward to accommodate us--immediately.  We were subsequently doted on by a variety of waiters, bartenders, and hosts/hostesses. Might have been a result of lower organization, but they were all trying to please. Some small mistakes in service were always met with apologies and making them right--the way it should be. The food was very good, ranging from veal parmesan, cheese pizza, salmon piccata, and Caesar salad. Nothing five star, but fresh and substantial. Drinks were topped-off without asking, everyone friendly, prices reasonable, and ambience authentic. Well done!!"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY! My fiancé and I got a \"free entree\" coupon in the mail so we thought we'd give Vito's a try since it's close by. Mistake. 

The server offered a bottle of wine at half off so we obliged and ordered wine. He didn't tell us that we couldn't also use our coupon in addition to the discounted wine, which it said nowhere on the coupon. But I digress. 

We both ordered small Caesar salads to start. The dressing tasted like something I could buy at the store and my fiancé's had a hair in it so we had to send it back.

The server recommended chicken arrabbiata to me, which normally wouldn't have been my pick but I figured that since things weren't going too well so far that he would know which entree would be redeeming. Wrong. My fiancé got an Alfredo dish. 

It was clear right away that the sauce on my dish, as well as the chicken, had been frozen and reheated. The sauce was watery and the chicken had a leathery texture. It was also laughable when we were offered \"fresh grated Parmesan\" that was exactly like what I can buy in a bag at the grocery store. Not fresh In the slightest. The only reason that this place gets 2 stars is because even though it tasted like they served us leftovers, the flavor was decent. 

Innocent bystanders may think that they're having a decent meal, but coming from someone who knows how to cook, this place should be on Kitchen Nightmares. Someone here clearly knows how to create some flavor, but then they choose to put it in the freezer. What a shame."}
{"text":"I think the most frustrating part was the parking and I had trouble finding the entrance. I ordered two pizzas, a meat lovers double crust and a cheese with ceaser salad. Like $25. It wasn't bad."}
{"text":"My wife and I had the calamari and ravioli for appetizer. The calamari was one of the best I have ever had, and perfectly cooked. When I say perfectly cooked it couldn't have been any more tender then it was. I wish they also included red sauce for the calamari though. 
The ravioli was pretty good as well.

I had the angel hair with the sunrise sauce blend, with meatballs and mushroom. The sunrise sauce could have used a bit more spices, but that is personal taste. My wife had the bowtie pasta with marinara. She really enjoyed this. We both liked the marinara sauce.

The meatballs were a smidge on the dry side, but just barely, and I found a couple small pieces of gristle in the meatball. They had a nice mild sweet Italian sausage flavor too them.

We ordered a pizza to go for the boys at home. 1/2 meat lovers and 1/2 deluxe and the pizza was delicious according to my boys. I had a slice of the deluxe and it had the perfect amount of toppings and flavor.

All in all we had a great time, Anthony our waiter, as well as other staff, were constantly attentive to our needs. I really liked the fact that Anthony refilled the drinks at the table instead of taking them away. Quite often waiters will take them away and it can be minutes or longer before they ever make it back.

The ambiance was nice and they were able to turn down the lights over the table for a romantic feel.

I will definitely come back to try other dishes. Thank you for a great meal."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since childhood. My absolute favorite Italian restaurant due to the fact that the food is simply remarkable and their customer service goes above and beyond the call. 

I always get the tortellini sunrise and add sausage, their pizza is also a home-run. You truly can't go wrong with anything on the menu. 

The ambience is very appealing and love the music. 

Met the general manager for the first time today and she was an absolute pleasure to speak with. Very genuine and good-natured. Family owned restaurant and you can tell by their culture that employs stay because how good they are not only to customers, but staff as well."}
{"text":"12/30/15

My first visit to Vito's Scottsdale location.  Vito himself invited me to try his Mesa location many years ago.  I remember thinking \"next time, I'll try the pizza.\"  I bought a Groupon a couple of weeks ago so that I may try this place (didn't know it existed in my neighborhood).

Seems like Vito's is a happening place for happy hour!  The menu certainly offers many interesting items, and most, if not all, are made in-house.  No frozen commercially-produced stuff, unlike some area restaurants prepare for HH.  I was torn between trying a few HH apps and having something from the dinner menu.  I decided I'd save HH for another time (with Mom) and try a pizza.  I was toying with the idea of Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo sans sun-dried tomatoes and mushrooms if the pasta was homemade, but it's made with Barilla.  

Was happy that I ordered the White Special, which consisted of \"olive oil, garlic, pine nuts, mozzarella, parmigiano reggiano, ricotta,\" which was listed under the \"Specialty Thin Crusts\" menu tab. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vitos-pizza-and-italian-ristorante-scottsdale?select=Jx4V2yUnDH7yLKZY5x6nEg  I ordered the largest (16 inches), as I had a very good feeling about this visit, and I'm glad I did!  Loved, loved, LOVED the pine nuts!  The pizzaiolo had a light hand sprinkling them on, so biting into one every few bites felt like I'd struck gold.  Oh, and this pizza was HUGE!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vitos-pizza-and-italian-ristorante-scottsdale?select=TypZsnfGcAy1YPoZEAP67g  It seemed like everyone turned around to have a look at where it landed.  An older couple kept eyeing it, so when the man tapped my shoulder to ask me which pizza did I get, I said \"the White Special\" and then asked him if they'd like to try it.  He hesitated at first, but when I stood up and searched for a knife to give him a slice, he just reached out and grabbed one himself!  His companion politely declined.  I could've sworn the young guy sitting adjacent to me- I sat at a community table just across the bar- wanted to try a slice, too, but decided to keep mum.  I felt bad for not extending the offer to him for a few seconds, but after seeing all the happy hour plates that eventually landed on their end of the table (they were a party of 8!), I got over it.

Lauren was friendly and patient, and also very busy!  If you decide to try happy hour here, or visit during HH, remember to ask for your check early on, or you'll have to wait an extra 15, 20 minutes, maybe even more, past the time you thought you'd leave.

Last, but not least, Vito's also offers brunch on the weekends!  I believe the prix fixe is $14, which comes with a choice of entree and beverage, and I want to say a bowl of fruit, or something else, but don't quote me on the latter.  I know it's more than just entree and beverage, because I remember being impressed with the deal.  Brunch runs from 10 am through 2 pm.  I'll be back to try HH soon.  The house chardonnay** sample went well with the white pizza.  :)  Thanks, Lauren!  Btw, the table focaccia was OK- I'd ask for it to be toasted next time.  The pesto butter was the star in this app. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vitos-pizza-and-italian-ristorante-scottsdale?select=s9CSYV33IEc3BUvjRZoP7Q


*Please tip on the original receipt amount and not on the discounted tab.
**Glass of house wine is $5 during HH.  On Wednesdays, bottles of wine are 50% off, and they can cork it for you to take home, so you \"don't have to drink it all here.\"

p.s.  Didn't get to try any desserts, since the three desserts that called my name (tiramisu, chocolate bread pudding, and cookie pizza) either contained powdered sugar (tiramisu filling), or corn syrup (caramel in bread pudding; Blue Bunny ice cream on cookie).  I might be able to try the cheesecake on a future visit..."}
{"text":"Went a few months ago after years of promising the owner I'd visit.  (I really did visit a few times before, Vito, but each time you weren't in!  When I'm invited to visit, I want to greet the host!)

Honestly, I don't recall much of the pasta dish he'd suggested I try, but I really wasn't feeling like pasta that evening.  The pizzas looked really appetizing, though!  Must round up a group so that we can sample a few!

I was very surprised to see how large this restaurant is.  I thought \"Vito's Pizza\" would be a small neighborhood joint (like Venezia's Pizzeria in Chandler/Gilbert), so I was taken aback.  Good-sized parking lot."}
{"text":"If all you want is pizza, this is the place. I like the buffalo chicken pizza best and the rest of them are good too The pizza rolls aren't too shabby either. I also love the ease of the drive through and that I can place an order on my way home from work and not have to get out of my car.

That being said, the rest of the menu is way overpriced for the quality. The Italian Beef sandwich was pretty weak. It tasted like a frozen beef  that was reheated with a ridiculous amount of mozzarella cheese on it. I expected better. The same can be said of the meatball sandwich. And the marinara sauce is way too sweet for my liking."}
{"text":"We used to come here a lot and honestly don't know why we stopped, because it's great. We love the desserts here, so leave some room for dessert. Their food is also great, it's a great place if you are looking for Italian food."}
{"text":"We have been eating Vito's pizza since they opened here in Mesa.. almost 30 years! .. today's pizza was not what we paid for.. we usually get sausage pizza, today I chose to have sausage on one side and extra cheese on entire pizza.. what we received was a pizza with 1/2 lacking in cheese all together.. very disappointed."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, finding a good thin crust pizza place is a task - until we found Vito's! Not only is their thin crust pizza delicious, the atmosphere is warm & welcoming and the staff is great! I wish I could eat there more often!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here tonight and were extremely disappointed. The reason for the two stars is because the place looked nice and the staff was good, however, the food was not. I had gotten the Penne Caprese and the chicken was undercooked so I ended up just taking the chicken off. My boyfriend had the Chicken Parmesan and he didn't like it either. I tried some of his and the sauce didn't have much flavor and the pasta was way over cooked. After we left, we wished we had never even came here."}
{"text":"Girlfriend recommended this place last week.  We haven't had Italian for quite a while.  The place is small on the outside but quite spacious on the inside.  

I checked us both in and was told the wait would be 10-15min.  In about 8min, we were sat down.  \"Sorry for the wait\"  Are you kidding? That was quick!   We're used to waiting a long time for a nice restaurant.  We were seated in a nice table and greeted quickly by our server Adam.

Hello, great service!!  Adam was friendly and knew what was good. Not having been there, I asked if I should try the baked ziti or beef stroganoff.  He said beef stroganoff, but both were great.  I ordered the stroganoff and my girlfriend ordered the lasagna.  We ordered some garlic bread that was out of this world.  The perfect soft center with a crispy out side. Delish!

We got our food pretty fast.  I had to try the lasagna, as I am a big snob when it comes to that.  Damn was it good!  My dish was just as great as he mentioned.  It was so good that I actually ate the left overs the next day.  I don't do that often! 

Adam was great through out the dinner. Kept our drinks filled and asked how our food was.  I highly recommend people sit in his section.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza!!! of course as soon as I moved out of my apartment across the street vito's came in, would have been there ALL the time otherwise! Really nice inside! Try the Buffalo chicken pizza its SO good!"}
{"text":"LOVE Vito's!! Everything I have ever had there has been wonderful! My favorite pizza is the buffalo chicken pizza, its amazing! Everyone there is super nice and helpful! Definitely worth going in and checking them out!"}
{"text":"Totally impressed with every facet of this establishment.  The building was unique, yet warm and inviting.  The Tortellini Sunrise, Chicken Risotto, Caesar salad, and Blueberry Cheesecake were all delicious.  Vinny, our server was exceptional.  In fact, it was one of the best server experiences that I can recall in quite some time.  I had passed by this restaurant hundreds of times over the years, and with last night being my first visit, I am ashamed of myself for not stopping to try it out sooner."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's good quality food, but on the pricy side! The antipasto salad, minestrone soup, veggie pizza, chicken piccata & baked ziti are among my top pics!!!! It's a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Vito's is pretty good food, not the top on my list but my husband and I will go here for a special occasion from time to time when we cant get in elsewhere and it does the job."}
{"text":"Oh man, what's not already been said about how amazing this place is?! Serious note.... cannot comment on the interior establishment, service etc as our order was conviently, professionally and quickly delivered to us. 

We ordered lasagna add meatballs and the seafood risotto. Holy smokes! Awesome. The lasagna was cooked perfect, the sauce was arromatic and very bright in flavor and the meatballs were great, not a bunch of filler, just good quality meat and spices. 

Moving on, the seafood risotto was not equally amazing it was outstanding. The lobster tail, cooked to perfection, the shrimps, again perfect and not to leave out the amazing calamari and the scallops. All tasted great, not over cooked and the risotto itself had an amazing creamy texture and flavors that were not super strong but felt intentional to not overpower the star here which was the seafood in the dish. 

Thank you Vito's for the excellent \"delivery at it's finest\" experience:)"}
{"text":"I have been up all night due to bad wings. They obviously thawed the wings and let them sit in the warm kitchen and they spoiled.  So for me they go from a four star to a one star for this error."}
{"text":"we were not happy with the food, the service or the prices.  Unhappy all around with the experience.  1st and last visit."}
{"text":"There isn't a bad thing I can say about Vito's.  It's one of my wife's and I favorite establishment.  Everything is done well and the service is top notch.  I would not hesitate to recommend this place."}
{"text":"On April 7, 2018 I reserved your Cellar to celebrate my husbands 60th Birthday. I just need to tell you THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU so much. The dinner was OUTSTANDING, the service was OUTSTANDING, everything was just fantastic. Please inform everyone who help was fantastic. I could go on and on and on. You don't realize how much it meant everything went so smooth from beginning to end. I will definitely have another party again. Chelsea offered numerous food selections, kept in close contact both via phone and e-mail. When I arrived everything was set up and ready to go, I just added a few decorations I chose to do that. Again than you so much"}
{"text":"Friend of mine recommended this place so we said why not.  Ordered the calamari which was very good not over cook great flavor.  Then I ordered the eggplant Parmesan sandwich more bread than eggplant.  Ask the waiter if he thought this was a acceptable  sandwich (eggplant is not an expensive vegetable.  I had 75% bread 25% eggplant would have gotten a better sandwich at subway) Offered me more marina sauce really.  Did something that I do not like to do and sent the sandwich back   Did offer to get me another meal but by the time the food arrived my husband was done eating.  Did give us a desert but really that is not what I go out to eat for.  I am a good cook so when I go out I expect good service which we did receive and an enjoyable eating experience which failed."}
{"text":"Review to follow soon"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants in Arizona. Top notch family owned. Excellent pizza, pasta, salad, wine, and service. If you are lucky enough to get Bobby as your waiter it will be a great evening."}
{"text":"Let's try this again. Waitress this time was Lauren. I was again disappointed today was not Wild Mushroom Soup day. In case I missed that in my last post.... It is out if this world!! Being that I've been unimpressed this far With my past I went with her recommendation of her favorite cheese stuffed tortellini. Again unimpressed. However the thin crust pizza is surprisingly good. But I wouldnt bother to return even with a groupon"}
{"text":"Love there happy hour here. Great food but the service is okay. Most of the clientele that go'a to Vito's are older. Every time my boyfriend and I go there we don't get treated the same as we would if we were older. This to me is disrespectful when I'm there just to have the same experience. Food is great. We always get the Seafood Au Gratin. It has the sweetness of the crab, Jumbo Shrimp and sautéed Sea Scallops. Great dish."}
{"text":"Pizza Friday Lives!

My coworker gave me a coupon for Vito's, so we carried out a large pie around 6:00 p.m. last week. A large with sausage on only half (no topping on the other side) came out to be more than $16, WITH a coupon. Without a coupon, I see large plain pizzas start at $19. If you want to pile on more toppings, you'll be in for a hefty price!

To be fair,the pizza was DELICIOUS. We loved the cracker-thin crust, the ample amounts of their cheese mix and boyfriend said the Italian sausage was obviously homemade and exceptional. The hostess who took care of me was incredibly peppy and prompt. The place seemed pretty packed (wow, lots of P alliterations in there), so their food is certainly drawing crowds in. But it's just a *leetle* out of my price range for pizza. We can find pizza (sometimes two) with a salad to split for almost the same price.

My final say? I'd certainly nosh from there again, but only with a coup! Am I cheap? (The hostess didn't take mine so we hopefully we can reuse, woohoo!)"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Mesa. The Italian food is great too"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, it looked so promising.  Three of us went on Sunday afternoon using a coupon for a free entree.  The best part of the meal was the pesto & garlic butter which came with the basket of bread.

I could not decide what to get and the waitress recommended the house made Tortellini with ricotta and marinated in marinara and alfredo sauce, she said it was not heavy.  Well, it was over heavy and I could not taste the Tortellini because it was swimming in the sauce which tasted not very good.  I sent it back.  We also ordered the Lasagna with meatballs which was swimming in marinara sauce and also was just average nothing to rave about.  Also ordered the Penne Caprese - beware of this - it is very very spicy and will burn your mouth if you are not prepared....also the balsamic vinegar on the top does not work well with this dish.  After I sent my Tortellini back, I wanted to try something else to give them the benefit....I ordered the Portabella Penne not real sure why it is called this as there are no mushrooms in it....this was in-edible....not able to eat loaded with garlic, I love garlic eat it everyday, this tasted like it was drenched in white wine and they used the whole bag of garlic - everyone at the table tried it and no one could eat it........we also ordered the breaded ravioli's for an appetizer...could not taste the ravioli because the bread was too thick......the meatball are very heavy and I did not like them, more like rocks than meatballs and a little on the spicy side..

Like I said in the beginning the best part of the meal was the Butter in the Bread Basket.........We were also disappointed that they sell Atlantic Salmon which is farm raised and loaded with chemicals, toxins and bacteria, all Atlantic Salmons is farm raised but they did not seem to know this, go figure...

the decor is real nice and the booths were very comfortable.  The do have a gluten free menu and gluten free pizza - so we might come back for the gluten free pizza and maybe on a different day as Sunday maybe they were slacking or something, the manager is a Lady and does not smile much, if when you smile at her."}
{"text":"a complete insult to italian cuisine. the calamari was fairly decent however only served with some trashy ranch dressing.. and that's where the good ends...
The green tea had NO FLAVOR. The ciabatta bread was COLD. not room temp. out of a refrigerator cold!
I ordered a special this evening... pasta with breaded shrimp with their specialty \"sunrise\" sauce (marinara/alfredo mixed together)... The sauce tasted like baby food, and the pasta combined with it tasted like water. The shrimp were a good size but there were only a few, considering the $16.95 price... (also, for this price, soup or salad should be included. not $2.00 more. The shrimp were overcooked and  I bit into one and had to spit it out into my napkin... something I NEVER EVER DO regardless of how something tastes.. It had a foul STRONG fishy taste that was just absolutely nauseating. I alerted the waitress to this and she seemed concerned but offered nothing in compensation. My family members ordered other non-impressive meals.. the vito's italian sausage sandwiches were also cold, and had      slimy boiled peppers in onions.  My dad's Chicken Picatta looked like it was made with frozen-in-a-bag chicken breasts from the grocery store.. again, absolutely insulting considering the menu price. Waitress was unpleasant and visibly angry about something going on with her co-workers.  Completely unprofessional. Let's hope that foul shrimp doesn't come back to haunt me in a few hours!"}
{"text":"If you have a gift card from Vito's don't try to use it because they sell them take your money, but when you try to use it they have numerous reasons why it can't be used to pay your bill.  The manager said she was sorry.  No compensation offered.   Our gift card was for $50.  Very poor management they have their money for the gift card but we had to pay the bill with a different form of payment."}
{"text":"Impressive! The Alfredo sauce was very creamy...not too heavy like most sauces!  We ordered the scallops and muscles.  The sauce that was so good... worth dipping in the Foccacia bread that they give you! I rate a place on their Tiramisu (AWESOME!).  You can tell that it is homemade. We will definitely be going back to try their pizza and their Comedy night!"}
{"text":"As part of our ongoing search for good calamari and toasted ravioli, my husband and I decided to try Vito's.  I thought the calamari was delicious, but toasted ravioli was not as memorable.  As for the entrees, we tried the seafood lasagna and chicken marsala.  The lasagna was stuffed with seafood (which was good), but the presentation was sloppy.  The whole thing was swimming with so much sauce that the lasagna was completely hidden.  The chicken marsala was standard and nothing special.  Our server was a little inattentive, but if the food were better, that would not stop us from coming back.  Based on what we sampled, I would come back for the calamari, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! This is our first time here so we went during HH. $5 house wines and 1/2 price appetizers. Their pizza is phemominal, best thin crust in the valley IMHO.  Very friendly bartenders and waitstaff. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Helpful and friendly staff. Little wait,  if any.  We only waited to get a booth.  Celebrated our 19th anniversary. 

Sangria and Moscato were really yummy. 

The bread was soft like it should be.  Pesto butter was good,  but difficult to spread on the bread.  

I had tortellini with sunrise sauce mixture of Alfredo with a touch of marinara. Great tasting!

Hubby had Penne Caprese. He's not a man of many words so he says it was delicious.  Balsamic vinaigrette drizzled over penne pasta,  chicken,  mozzarella chunks and tomatoes.  

Overall,  great meal."}
{"text":"Vito's seafood lasagna is awesome, and the service is great too. Their pizza is really good as well but I haven't had it very much."}
{"text":"I am basing this review on one trip for dinner, and on two pizzas, so I could be missing a lot.  That said, Vito's was simply not fun, nor was the food scrumptious, so why would I go back?  I can think of two better pizza places within 5 minutes of this location.  

There is a dining area, which is dark and uninspiring, although clean and in good repair.  There is a large bar area which is noisy, even on on off day, and the noise cascades through the dining room.  No problems with the service, but the pizzas, which most reviews seem to say is their best point, were just okay.  Typical thin crust, unremarkable cheese, and average toppings.  I ate it, I enjoyed it, but the next day I can't remember it.  

Maybe I'm just too old for Vito's."}
{"text":"My husband and three year old stopped in for dinner tonight and were blown away! 
We both got the all you can eat pasta for $9.95. 
We got fresh bread with pesto butter to start, a salad, then the main course. 
The portions are perfect size, so much flavor, and very filling! 

My son had spaghetti and meatballs, their meatballs are HUGE, and their fruit is very fresh! 

Our server, Anthony, was very knowledgeable of the menu and on top of refilling drinks and taking dirty dishes. 
Definitely worth every penny. 

IMO this places puts Olive Garden to shame! 
We will be back!"}
{"text":"Came with my grandparents for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. They both ordered soup and I ordered a pizza. The soup came out but the pizza took an extra 20 minutes. By the time I got my food they had been finished eating for a few minutes."}
{"text":"We come here often. Tonight we had a large party for a birthday! Tasha, our server, was awesome! She did an excellent job taking care of us. Wonderful evening! Thank you so much!!"}
{"text":"13 years ago my wife and I moved from Utah to Mesa Arizona. The night we closed on our house our realtor treated us to couple of pizzas from the pizzeria down the street, half a mile away. That pizzeria was Vito's. For the five years we lived in at home we ate at Vito's probably twice a month because we felt the food was superior and delicious.  I'll be honest while at the restaurant the food was awesome and it was almost every time that we saw the owner, Vito, meandering around the restaurant shaking hands and making his presence known. We could tell the food was from an old family recipe. 

We moved to North Phoenix a couple of years ago and my father just discovered the Vito's opened up a location in north Scottsdale. I father and I with there Thursday for lunch looking forward to that same wonderful  home-cooked Italian food we enjoyed in Mesa. I'm very very very sad to say that we discovered that Vito has sold his locations to another new owner. That new owner must've brought their own recipes to the table because it was absolutely horrible food. My father had the veal and I have the baked ziti which was one of my favorite Veto meals. The food was very very bland and dry and even cold to the touch (temperature). I will not be returning to Vito's as there many other pizzerias that keep a good thing going by not changing the recipe"}
{"text":"Vito's is a staple in terms of Mesa restaurants. Quality Italian food with great customer service.

Pizza is always great with a nice thin crust that is crisp. Always enjoyable with Vito's hot wings or a fresh salad. 

Pasta is also a great choice. I love the baked ziti w/ meat sauce."}
{"text":"Seriously pizza best in the valley?  We had a pizza delivered. It was horrible. Like a frozen tombstone from the store or little caesers. Couldn't believe it. We've eaten there twice. Spaghetti was great. Saw pizzas go by us. Looked so good. Was so excited to try it. Ordered pepperoni with extra cheese. Should have just ordered hungry Howie's or something cheaper and better. Also ordered crab stuffed shrimp their special. So salty couldn't even eat it."}
{"text":"Food is good!  Service, not so much!  I had the same server both times I went to lunch and she really has an attitude!  She was irritated instantly when we asked not to be seated by the kitchen door.   If you are miserable as a server/manager, get out of the service industry!  

Will never go back to Vito's again."}
{"text":"I wish I lived closer to Vito's.  It's such a cute and authentic Italian restaurant and the owners are great.  Vito and Joanne are very involved in the restaurant and you'll probably see them when you're there having a meal.

Vito is actually from Italy, so that gives the restaurant the Italian cred it needs right off the bat.  Who better to own and operate an Italian restaurant than an Italian, right?  They tend to have those great family recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation and Vito's food reflects this!

I have tried quite a few dishes here, so here are my recommendations:

For appetizers: Pizza bread, garlic bread or fried calamari.
For dinner: vegetarian thin crust pizza (amazing!), veggie calzoni, gnocchi, tortellini sunrise, pasta gardenia or eggplant parmigiana.
For dessert: homemade cannoli.  While they have other desserts too, this one is so, so good I can't even put it into words!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this 5 stars because i feel like we hit the jackpot. We are out of towners and it's always scary trying a new place. 

The building is really cool on the outside and plenty of room inside. It's a classy place that you know will deliver. The place was so crowded on a Tuesday night. Good sign. 

We had the calamari, \"seasoned\" with Cajun ranch (AWESOME). We ordered the Sicilian pizza. Great crispy crust, great toppings and flavor. 

Was a plus that bottles of wine were 1/2 off on Tuesdays!!! 

Visit this gem. It was great, not to mention being opened for 30 years!"}
{"text":"Very authentic and tasty food. We came on a Wednesday to get the Cream of Mushroom soup; YUM! They have different soups each day of the week, so if you have a favorite, visit the website to plan your visit. Warm and delicious bread is served upon your visit with sides of plain and compound butter.

We started with the half/half Fried Zucchini and Fried Mushrooms. There was a lot of breading on the mushrooms for the size of the mushrooms themselves, but they were still pretty good. The zucchinis however we both preferred, and would be more interested to try the stuffed mushrooms next time over the fried ones.

A bowl of the cream of mushroom soup was one entree, and I finally decided to go with the simple Grilled Chicken Dinner. The plate comes with two chicken breasts, pasta with marinara sauce, and a side of seasonal vegetables. I requested that the vegetables be simply steamed, and the waitress had no problem accommodating my request.

Before placing our order, I asked if they had whole wheat or whole grain pasta available as a substitute on any of their entrees. The waitress said that although they do not, they do have gluten-free pasta (rice based). I decided to go with the gluten-free pasta for the pasta on my chicken entree.

Our soup and entree arrived shortly. The chicken was moist, the vegetables were cooked very well (not crunchy and underdone), and the gluten-free pasta was barely distinguishable over regular penne. The marinara sauce was delicious; I kept trying to find more at the bottom of my plate to use with my chicken and vegetables!

We couldn't end there. Italian restaurant plus us equals Tiramisu. We ordered a slice and were told it is homemade; hooray! The Tiramisu was plated beautifully with a rose-carved strawberry, a sprig of mint, and a drizzle of chocolate. Although my taste buds are a little desensitized to the rum and espresso in Tiramisu desserts, it was still very delicious. Light, creamy, not too sweet, and enough to share with whoever you are having dinner. This Tiramisu is worth getting again.

Service was a tad slow, but we were sitting out on the patio when there were no other guests outside (it was our choice to sit outside, so the fault is on us). Service was very friendly though.

We will definitely be back. There is a ton to try on the menu. The pizza looked tempting, and among the entrees, the Seafood Lasagna, the Linguini Pescatore, and the Lobster Ravioli all looked mouth watering."}
{"text":"Awesome place and superb waitess named Kim  excellent food and family environment been coming here for over 20 years"}
{"text":"Do not waste your money on the garlic knots, they are completely flavorless and filled with tasteless butter. We took a bite and had an explosion of butter like they were filled. The outside is crunchy but the inside is soggy and we couldn't finish them. The pizza was good...not personally a fan of cutting it into \"squares\" (especially when they serve it on a grate making it difficult to scoop up) but we got the buffalo chicken and Wrigley pizzas and both had generous toppings and good flavor. Service was quick and friendly!"}
{"text":"Our absolute favorite place to go for happy hour. It's always a fun time, the food is great and everyone is so nice. When we are not in the bar, we ask for Frankie to be our waitress. She is the best. Try their chicken and apple salad- wow!"}
{"text":"Simply the most authentic and best Italian in the east valley and at affordable prices!"}
{"text":"We had the Margarita pizza with sausage on it. It was very tasty! However for the price the portions are very small. Two of us shared a small which was not filling enough. In fact the small looked about the same size as the individual. Not much sausage on it either...I'd be surprised if there was even half of a sausage on the pizza. It came with a basket of bread and a garlic pesto spread. The ambiance and decor were very inviting. Have the portions been bigger I would've giving this a five star rating. Not sure if I would go back again."}
{"text":"We had Vito's come and cater a dinner for 75 people.  Chelsea their catering rep was on top of everything we needed.  She was a fabulous liaison.   They were prompt, thought of everything needed, the food was hot and delicious and they quietly cleaned up and removed the trash.  I would definitely recommend Vito's catering!  Great experience."}
{"text":"Thank God this place came to North Scottsdale!!!!!!!!!!!!! There are no good restaurants in this neighborhood. lol So when this place came along we were skeptical, but then we went there and the Italian entrees are delicious!!!!!!!!! I have been sooooo tired of not having any real italian restaurants in North Scottsdale problem solved. We have not tried the pizza so I can not vouch for that, but the entrees and pasta dishes are great. If you know actual east coast real Italian food and looking for it (because you are tired of all the chef Boyardee Scottsdale restaurants) come here. Alyssa was our server and she was AWESOME. I will be eating here several times a week. And the place was redecorated nice. We need real restaurants like this in North Scottsdale. I will be eating here several times a week."}
{"text":"I love Vito's.  The thin-crust personal pizzas are SO good.  They have regular, wheat, or gluten-free crust and a large variety of delicious toppings.  The food perfectly compliments the atmosphere of the lovely, Italian grotto."}
{"text":"I was shocked to read the two one-star reviews on this place. 

We stopped in here last night for dinner and were both pleasantly surprised. She got the Fettuccine Alfredo with Chicken, and I tried the special - Orange Roughy stuffed with crab.

Service was excellent, atmosphere was nice and dark, food was well prepared, and the Alfredo sauce was fantastic."}
{"text":"Every time I try to order online there is a problem and I HAVE to call in and WAIT at least 7 minutes on hold JUST to have my order taken. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza with only the freshest ingredients.  Service was great. Price is what you expect for such perfect food. 
  Thin crust pizza and ingredients that don't leave you with a heavy greasy feel. Healthy pizza in your mind."}
{"text":"Who had a great time we had tonight, brought my brother in for his birthday and there is a large group of us. Deborah Weber was our waitress and she was awesome handle the whole group so well. We love the food it was great, like I say wonderful service, wonderful night we got to set out on the patio and just really enjoyed everything. Will come back a lot!"}
{"text":"Had the calamari and it was amazing! We also had the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken and he chicken had a great flavor. We were all over super impressed and want to go back to try other items."}
{"text":"I will just start off with this place is amazing! The quality of food and portion sizes are very fair based on the prices. The bartender Alyssa was very helpful on helping me choose a meal for myself. Thanks for the great service and another great meal!"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst pizzas I've ever had. I have eaten pizza here many times in past years and found it to be fairly good. Something has drastically changed in the past year. The crust is paper thin and tasteless. The cheese is minuscule, dry, and awful. The meat is sub standard and in small portions. 
The texture, taste, and aroma are bad. I got the pizza for take out and it was ice cold when I got it home and it's not like I live far. I will not be going back anymore. It's a shame because it used to be so good and I enjoyed it, but it's changed. It is now overpriced and bad tasting. So sad it has changed"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza from Vito's for delivery yesterday.  Decided to get 4 pizzas.  One of which was their white special pizza.  The latter was cardboard. Extremely dry. Nothing like described and no flavor.  The other pizzas were so salty even the kids refused to eat them.  In the end we ended up throwing them out and putting in a frozen pizza.  We are not picky about pizza, but we couldn't even eat this.  The amount of salt wasn't normal.  I don't think we will order this again.  $60 down the drain"}
{"text":"Love love love the calzones and unique food at this restaurant service is excellent.... But the bar not so happy unique or delicious this is the 2nd time in which our drinks were far less than satisfactory would have given 5 stars if the bar had not slacked! Drinks taste bad first experience second experience their was particles of gunk appeared to be from the nozzle of the soda machine... Eaeeeewwww"}
{"text":"My son recommended Vito's for my birthday dinner and I am so glad he did. We had 11 people in our party and were served immediately. The waiter, Carter, was excellent and made sure we had everything (i.e. drinks) we needed even before the entire party arrived. The food was amazing! Again, we had 11 people and everyone loved what they ordered. I had the eggplant parmigiana and I have to admit, it was the best I've had in a very long time. The eggplant was beautifully cooked, very light and tender and the sauce was excellent. All the appetizers, antipasto salad, and desserts were great (including my free birthday spumoni). I was even gifted a coupon for a free appetizer when we return. I would highly recommend Vito's not only for the amazing food but also for the excellent service. Thank you Carter and the entire staff!"}
{"text":"Went here for live music with my boyfriend last Saturday and it was great! The bar side was packed so if you're looking for a quiet dinner I would sit on the dining side. But if you are looking for great music and a great crowd of people definitely come in for the live music. The food is great and so is the service. It may look overpriced at first but the quality and taste of the food is well worth it! Pizza is to die for!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great dinner with friends at Vito's. We all enjoyed our meal and the service was great. 5 stars"}
{"text":"Tyler was a fantastic waiter, very helpful and informative. Pizza was loaded with toppings and delicious!"}
{"text":"Amazing. The white chicken Alfredo pizza is the best. Order more than one because it is thin crust and it is so good that you can eat the whole thing yourself. Trust me, it's that good."}
{"text":"Thirty-ish years later, still great. There was a period of confusion after the sale, but the return of a great manager has brought this nice restaurant back up to par. A few very long term employees remain over the years, and they are conscientious and delightful."}
{"text":"So impressed with Vito's....the food is awesome and comes out in literally no time at all. The service was fantastic (thank you Justin!). The prices are very reasonable and there's a really cool interior vibe and atmosphere that I love. One of the best happy hours in town. Check it out and ask for Justin, he is really terrific!"}
{"text":"I had a groupon so I took my grandma out for dinner when she got into town.  

I ordered a pizza and my grandma got the grilled chicken dinner.  The pizza was ok nothing that blew me away but it wasn't bad either.  My grandma's meal actually was very large in portion size and was good.  I would suggest sticking to the Italian food instead of the pizza but that's just my opinion.

Overall it was a nice restaurant plenty of room inside the staff was very friendly and they had a good wine list.  

3.5/5"}
{"text":"Best bar in town by far with great food and awesome staff very friendly environment my favorite was the rigton Vito with a cold beer"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. They have a nice gluten free menu. Staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place as we live close by and the ambiance and decor are wonderful!
This was our first time visiting and we went for happy hour and found a great booth in the bar area.  A waiter came up and told us our server was John the bartender who was busy and could he take our drink order, which we did.  I asked him what the happy hour cabernet was and pointed to the happy hour menu and he replied it was the Ruthersford Hill cab, which I ordered.  Hubby had a Stella :).
We ordered the bruschetta and were served our drinks.  John the bartender came over and took our food order, which was a pizza and calamari.
We were served the calamari, which was way undercooked and very rubbery.  When John came over to see how our food was, we told him about the calamari.  He apologized and took the tray away.  The manager came over and was very kind and told us they all tried it in the kitchen and it was not the way they should have served it and agreed with us that it was underdone.  He asked us to please try another order and we agreed.  It was brought to the table and unfortunately was still undercooked and rubbery.  We asked John to try it and he agreed, apologized and took it away.  We never were approached by the manager again, who when he did see us, he avoided making eye contact or approaching us.  Believe me, we understand a bad night in the kitchen and are sympathetic to these kind of situations, but not to say anything again was not the right choice.
The pizza we ordered was just okay.  It also had a feeling of being undercooked and chewy.  
John the bartender was awesome and attentive, however he was very busy trying to tend the bar and also wait tables.  He was under pressure and rose to the occasion.
He also comped us a drink which we did not expect but appreciated.
When we got the bill the happy hour wine that was supposed to be $5 was actually $10 and when I asked John about it he said it was not a happy hour wine.  We were told by the other waiter that it was THE happy hour wine and that is why I ordered it.  I told John he needed to educate his waiter on what was happy hour and what was not.  
Okay, so we will allow this as \"just one of those nights\" and will go back because we really liked the atmosphere and the staff was friendly.  I hope as they grow they can overcome some of the kitchen difficulties and train the wait staff as to what is available and to answer the client's questions.  We all are human and understand that there are off nights, etc, so in the future, manager....it's okay and at least provide your visitors with an opportunity to accept your apologies and respect your taking ownership of mistakes made by staff.  
We are hoping our next visit is better.  Stay tuned for our next visit!"}
{"text":"Was asked where I wanted to go for Father's Day and Feeling a little nostalgic I threw out Vito's. Visualized the Vito's I grew up with 20 years ago, but things have changed some. Drove a decent drive to get there and was ready for a cold beer. Got the beer but it was served in a warm glass and he beer was about the temp of my pool in summer time. Sent them back and opted for bottle which was cold and yummy. ..WIN That's where I will leave it for the \"story\". 
Here are key things of the experience 
Good:
1. Food still above average. Pizza/salad really good-tad more saucy than I remember 
2. Friendly staff and nice server 

Bad:
1. Of course warm keg storage 
That should not have been served 
2. Slow service- had to ask for bread after 15 min & never got water(plenty of bus boys making sure wall was held up).  Server brought out pre dinner(requested) salad with dinner 
3. 85 degrees in restaurant. Checked out thermostat on way out and it looked to be set at 84!  It's 120 out. You are going to spend money on electric. Drop it down to 78 at least!
4. Men's bathroom was destroyed with urinal broken down and everywhere on floor. 

Overall experience summary  --a place past its prime. Management oversight lacking. Needs a rescue. 

If I get a hankering for a trip down memory lane I will opt for take out. 

Bummer."}
{"text":"My parents recommended this restaurant as one they liked.  My wife and I did not enjoy the food or the experience.

The food was just bland and not unique.  I had the Penne Caprese which had penne pasta tossed with grilled chicken, fresh mozzarella, tomato, red onions, fresh garlic and basil, drizzled with balsamic glaze.  Sounds good to me!  It wasn't a bad dish, it just wasn't a good dish.  The two chicken breasts were grilled and flavorless, the balsamic glaze was meh and the mozzarella was probably from a grocery store.

While I probably would have been okay with the normalness of Vito's dishes, the service was lacking as well and those two things combined make me pretty unhappy.  My iced tea was refilled once during service and the ice had completely melted.  I HATE iced tea without ice.  We were sitting on the patio and the server seemed like she probably had tables inside as well and that restaurant is huge on the inside.  Also, the side table on the patio with the refill pitchers and Micros terminal looked like a folding table with a dirty cloth draped over it and lots of stuff stored underneath.  It just wasn't very nice looking and seem like it should be something that was behind the scenes instead of on the patio.

IF I went back to Vito's (which is a big if) I don't think I would sit on the patio again because it's my least favorite type of patio setting.  The patio is basically in the parking lot and has a lot of cars that drive past it.  I really don't need exhaust with my bland chicken; it doesn't make it better.

I think Vito's has it's core demographic and is successful because of their return business, I'm just not that demographic and will probably go to Olive Garden the next time I'm looking for Italian.  Sorry Vito's; I just wasn't impressed... but I wanted to like you."}
{"text":"We have been to Vito's numerous times and absolutely love it! The staff is always very friendly and inviting as well as has solid recommendations. We thoroughly enjoyed the spaghetti, calamari, buffalo chicken pizza, and Tuscan chicken salad! We highly recommend Vito's and will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"I am slowly becoming a regular here, consistency has been great! The pizzas are amazing and I have had the lasagne which was very good! I look forward to many returns, maybe I'll try dessert next time! LoL"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best pizzas in the valley.  Also the desserts are amazing. Overall a really great place to eat."}
{"text":"Well I thought I screwed up when I tried to make a reservation but was told they had closed the book because it was to close to Valentines Day.  We had six in our party so we decided to get there early before the rush.  Well we still had to wait about 25min before they asked if we would mind being seated it the basement.  We had no problem with that.  So we go down the stairs and the room was empty of diners but all the tables were set and ready to go.  Our server greeted and seated us. Well let me tell you, if you can dine in the basement  you will be glad you did. The setting is intiment, cozy, and warm.  The accoustics are quieting and much more private that the main dinning room. 
Of course the meal was fantastic, as usual.  We all ordered different selections and everyone raved about their selections.  Our server was Tiffany and was outstanding in every aspect.  Oh did I mention we were the only folks seated in the basement.
So in review, don't worry if they want to put you in the basement, ask for Tiffany, all their meals are excellant, call ahead for reservations (especilly) on special occasions."}
{"text":"I have been here so many times as family comes in town or friends who love to go here, but I as of recently have thought that it was all ok. When I was younger, I loved to go to Vito's with the family. The last few times, it has taken some time to get food out and the food has been ok, I have gotten pasta dishes as well as the pizza. I have to say that I do enjoy the atmosphere here."}
{"text":"I frequent Vito's A LOT, I come with my usual friends, I bring newbies, I even make a point to bring out of towners in to try what I consider excellent Italian food. Today I must admit I was extremely disappointed in the customer service. Our waiter, who we have had serve us before was very nice. However the issue was that the restaurant was extremely hot and uncomfortable, to the point I couldn't enjoy my food nor even eat it. My friend who is never hot, and typically puts on a sweater when I am warm, was even complaining to me. When I brought this to our waiter's attention he apologized and said he would let the manager know and take care of something on the bill. When he returned with the bill, he asked if the manager had stopped by, she hadn't, nor had the bill be discounted at all. We didn't ask for a discount but it was offered and quite frankly I think we deserved it for the fact that I had to package up our entire meals to go. We all know how Fettuccini Alfredo turns out the next times it's warmed- oily.... yuck. So now I am stuck with a $20 meal I won't eat, my clothes are soaked with sweat, and my evening with my girlfriend that I was so looking forward to has been cut short. I expect more from Vito's as I have been treated far better than this. There are many places I can choose to dine at, and this experience will definitely make me think twice at dropping $50-75+ here"}
{"text":"Being so close to this location, I really tried my best to like their food but every time it fell flat.
We tried their pastas, pizzas, appetizers and we were still just not impressed with the quality.
We decided to give up on ordering Vito's and take our business elsewhere.
Sorry Vito's."}
{"text":"First off it smells amazing in here. We've come in for drinks twice the bartebeer is super nice."}
{"text":"I got the chicken cannelloni. I'd say it was good, but felt as though the chicken wasn't thoroughly cooked. I'd probably like it more if it were vegetarian. The sunrise sauce is good!"}
{"text":"Great family restaurant. They have a lot of regulars which I think is a good sign of a great place! They often have a groupon deal too which is nice for extra savings."}
{"text":"Went to Vito's for early dinner, been going there since my first date with my husband.  We had the Monday special, we have never been  disappointment with anything we have ever ordered and tonight was no exception, greeted at the door, promptly seated, drinks and bread, large antipasto salad , fresh pasta and sauce, prompt refills, smiles, all lead up to a wonderful dinner.
Thank you again for being Vito's"}
{"text":"Have only used this restaurant for take-out pizza. It is very good. They price the medium size (which is quite large) the same as the small so I always end up getting it and having some left cold for the next day (college memories). 

They do not skimp on toppings. A few pieces really are a meal. While traditional pepperoni and green pepper is my default selection, the BBQ chicken is excellent. It's loaded with fresh grilled chicken which has some tasty char.

The staff is very friendly and they get the pizza out quickly. They cut it like a grid with lots of medium-sized square pieces (instead of traditional triangles) which are convenient for sharing."}
{"text":"Shannon was the best waitress ever! Fun place, fun times, and amazing food! We will be going back many more times!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. We had double whole wheat crust (which was still thin), artichokes, pesto, black olives, onions. Beautiful, and 4 out of 4 of us said it was really, really good."}
{"text":"Food is very good!  Tonights ahi sliders were amazing. Portions are nice. Nice happy hour with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible experience tonight.  The staff was rude and service beyond abysmal.  Much better Italian options in area."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Vito's since they opened in the mid-1980's.  Sometimes the food was great, and sometimes it was not so great.  

The last time I ate there before today was about a year ago, and the food was lousy and expensive.  That was that...I was done with Vito's for good.

Well, today I got invited to lunch as a guest, and I am so glad that I went back.  The entire menu has been re-vamped.  The most exciting part was that Vito's now offers several different \"designer salad\" selections instead of the tired old Caesar salad or mixed green salad.  I ordered the Mango/Blackened Shrimp Salad (with no blue cheese), and I have to say that it was one of the best salads I have ever eaten!  Even though the shrimp were a bit overdone, the dressing was sweet and wonderful, the greens were absolutely fresh, and the cranberries and candied nuts added a welcome contrast to the dish

Another pleasant surprise was the bread basket, which was over-flowing with super-soft slices of homemade bread and two different types of butter: plain and herb.  Oh, and the wine servings were not skimpy at all, and the wine was very tasty as well.
 
I couldn't have been happier with my meal, and I am very pleased that Vito's has changed their menu with offerings worth the asking price.  Whoever is responsible on the Vito's team for updating and upgrading the menu, you are to be commended.

Bravo, Vito's!  You have convinced me to come back!"}
{"text":"Was their last night for dinner my 1st time won't be the last great food good prices and Vinny took excellent care of us. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I thought with family owned restaurants you get home make meals -- not here!

We have been to Vito's many times and have enjoyed the food until the past year. We had not been for about 6 months and now remember why.  Our waitress was nice enough and served us promptly -- but there were only a couple other tables filled as it was only 4:30. I always get the prawn cocktail as an appetizer - no longer on the menu. I then would get manicotti -  no longer on the menu!  We ordered the \"Baked Brie\" with fig spread. We rec'd it in about 5 minutes - How can it really be baked? Pretty sure it was a Sysco product because it did not look like they made it! The first 2 bites were tasty though... However, it was cold inside! We let the waitress know it was cold she took it back and popped it in the microwave!  

Then we got our meals - the FISHY smell  of my husband's fettuccini with shrimp was overwhelming!  My veal marsala was gummy and bland - no flavor and the sauce did not seem like it was homemade - and the veal was somewhat tough. When the waitress asked how things were I said very bland - she said sorry and walked away. 

Now both courses of our meal that was poor! She came to the table to see if we wanted anything else and never even offered something else for my meal nor took anything off our bill. The only good thing was the bread and butter....

Will NOT be going back. Not home made and expensive. The pasta with 4 (large shrimp) $20.00"}
{"text":"Vito's has become one of out favoriate places, in part because they have online ordering and both deliver (around 45 minutes) or a drive-up window (around 20 minutes, for nights when we're REALLY hungry).  We probably order from here once a week, sometimes more.

The food is excellent, consistent and always arrives hot and fresh.  We have only had 2 issues the entire time we've been ordering.  Sometimes one of our pizzas will come out wrong (the info was entered correctly on the website, but it isn't normal to ask for pizza with no sauce so sometimes it comes with sauce.)  In each case they have made us another pizza and delivered it REALLY quickly at no charge.

The other issue is a recent one that I hope to see fixed soon.  Recently they have started asking for a signature and credit card imprint every time they deliver an online order.  I can understand asking once, but it defeats the purpose of having efficient internet ordering to do it every time.  I understand the need to protect from fraud, but it shouldn't be at the expense of regulars.  We've been told this is getting fixed (and I will edit this review once it does), but in the meantime, only 4 stars for a less than efficient delivery process."}
{"text":"One of the best pies you can get in the state!!!!! Very generous with the toppings. Goat cheese on the pizza will change your life"}
{"text":"Delicious Italian food with a variety of gluten free options available. This place has been around for ever and for a reason!"}
{"text":"This is the best Pizza in the USA, no doubt. I have tried the other places they say are the best, and I guarantee you they are not. Vitos is the real deal!"}
{"text":"It has been many years since I have rated here, and my wife had never been.  The service was very good. I ordered the meat lovers pizza and a prickly pear margarita.  Both were delicious. Roxie had the Chicken Marsala.  It was delicious. We will definitely return soon."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Vito's since I was like 10 yrs old. I used to do yard work for a neighbor and I wouldn't even care about the end of day pay, I would always be looking forward to lunch because he would always take us to Vito's. Well, I always remembered how much of a treat this pizza was and it always reminds me of those spring and fall days, taking lunch after doing yard work. This has some of the Best Pizza I've had here in AZ. I'm a native so trust me, ive tried other places. We get the thin crust and ask for it well done since recently learning \"well done\" means they keep it in the oven for a couple min longer and the crust gets crispier. This last weekend I wasn't in the mood for pizza, and tried the Chicken stuffed sausage and I am carb cycling so they were really friendly and accommodating in switching the risotto to Asparagus. The chicken was freaking amazing!!! I talked about it till the next day to my wife. I usually don't venture out into trying new things but man, it was phenomenal and glad I did. The Buffalo chicken pizza is another I would recommend, since it a favorite of mine. I have had other dishes and have never been let down by the quality of the food. Partys of 6 can call to make reservations, but if your going with a date or just a few people its best to get there early. Its no secret that this place gets super busy fast and we've waited up to a hour before. It is well worth it. This is a true Gem in Mesa."}
{"text":"Usually I am not a big fan of thin crust pizza, but Vitos has the Italian signature of everything into that pizza.  I guess it depends what you order, but we put a little ham, pepperoni, onions, and green bell peppers.  Those particular flavors just blended really well together.  My only complaint is that they did not have house bread to serve."}
{"text":"Vito's Mesa has got to be the best Italian food next to my Parents! Service is warm and friendly . My new favorite place ! If you haven't been this is defiantly a MUST .. Hard to find great Italian in Mesa .."}
{"text":"We haven't been here for years and now I remember why. The food is mediocre at best. Though service was exemplary and I have to give them that. The pasta was bland and the meat sauce - also bland. I did have a good salad, but then I find that hard to mess up. We also tried the fried asparagus appetizer and it was interesting. I do love asparagus, but whatever vinegary sauce they used, it killed the taste of the asparagus itself. My tablemates had the meat-lovers pizza and said it was pretty good. Hence the 2-stars and not a 1-star from me. Again, service was very good. But I won't be back. Sorry."}
{"text":"I've had much better. Keep looking, FUEL not food."}
{"text":"Good food. Great service. Friendly servers and hosts and manager around checking on everyone's meal. Very busy with lots of people waiting and still had very prompt service and easy check in for party of 5. 
Will be back very soon."}
{"text":"I just have to say on our recent visit ..which was my first ..  was as wonderful! The food was as amazing as our server Kim.. I made a new friend in our hour there and absolutely will return. The portion sizes of what we ordered was perfect and the entire vibe of this place is a must to experience while in Mesa. I give it two thumbs up."}
{"text":"My wife is out of town visiting the grand kids and I thought I would treat myself to a Father's Day dinner at Vito's. After all, my favorite entre, Pork Osso Buco was listed as a special. I was greeted pleasantly by 2 hostesses upon entering and I asked to first sit at the bar before moving to a table. Jonathan the Manager announced quite loudly that table 62 was available to all within range and possibly even the deceased were made aware of the vacant table. I ordered a glass of wine but not before being informed that table 62 was again available 2 more times even more loudly than previously mentioned. Following the three (3) reminders I was asked if I would like to move to my table as it was ready...Really I wasn't aware.
My family and I have been regulars at Vito's for 3 years and have always enjoyed the service and hospitality. This experience was a drastic change leading me to conclude that Jonathan previously worked at a reform school or a local prison. By the way, the Osso Buco a special of the evening was sold out at 6:00 PM when ordered, just adding to a disappointing experience. 
A salad appetizer and lasagna main were ordered for dinner. Within 2 minutes of the salad being delivered, the Lasagna arrived only to be sent back to be held in the warmer. The rush continued however; at least I had established a beachhead at the much announced table 62. 
This was a 1 star experience with the 2nd star for Sheri who did her best to provide a good experience in a ridiculous situation.  Don't know if I'll return."}
