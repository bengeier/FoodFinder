{"text":"Always the best fish and chips ever.  My daughter often substitutes their rice for fries with the grilled fish. Their service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"First off, I'm so glad I came here after a long enough hiatus from this place. I can't believe I hadn't ordered from here in a year and it's not because I didn't like their food before; I got caught up trying other fish & chip places. So Granny's I apologize for not coming back sooner. 
The place is kept really clean & it's a casual dining room. Let's get to the Food: Fish & chips are excellent. I've only eaten halibut. You can have your fish grilled or deep fried in batter(my fav). The prices are comparable to other fish & chip places in the neighbourhood. The chips are not the usual looking \"fresh cut\" like you normally get elsewhere; you know the ones where you get lots of uneven chips, but they claim they are fresh cut. I actually like their fries better. The other things like the appetizer breaded calamari is decent. If your in the mood to dine in then this place is casual & quaint.  I will definitely be coming here from now on a little more."}
{"text":"If you are serious about your Halibut fish then this is a place i recommend 
you try. Fish amazing , coleslaw amazing , bread from Cobs bakery amazing. Fries , same. Love it love it. Thx Granny's"}
{"text":"Was driving by and stopped in for the first time.  Ordered a halibut and chips.  First thing I noticed that really irates me is when food handlers don't use gloves.   The old man I'm the back was preparing the food with his bear hands which I find to be very gross. 

The place was also very empty. 

After seeing no gloves being used I kind of lost my appetite."}
