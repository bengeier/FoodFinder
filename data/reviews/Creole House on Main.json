{"text":"I wanted to love it, but I just don't.  Good people running it and working there, but the food falls short.    Servings were small, taste was \"okay\", chicken and shrimp were way overdone and rubbery -- like they had been cooking in the sauce all day.  I love Cajun food, so I went back again, and was met with the same small portions of average (at best) food.  I will continue to travel to Cajun Queen for great Cajun food, sorry!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there with two other couples last night. We were shocked on the mediocre service, and the awful food. We ordered fried green tomatoes, crawfish appetizers and the alligator. If you have ever tried fried green tomatoes in South Carolina or alligator in Florida, you will agree that these appetizers here tasted like they were taken from a frozen bag and deep fried. There was more deep fried crust then the item. It was horrible. I ordered the shrimp etouffee was awful. My husband got the spicy barbequed shrimp. My dish was more spicy then his dish. They tend to have gotten crazy with the black pepper, extremely spicy with a horrible after taste. If you have ever been to New Orleans and had their delicacies, you definitely don't want to go to this restaurant. The six of us agreed that this restaurant will definitely not survive past the summer. Once people go to it the first time, they won't return. If you are craving creole food, go the to cajun restaurant in Charlotte, it is worth the drive."}
{"text":"I ordered crawfish crabcakes and seafood chicken trio.  The shrimp were bland,  unseasoned and  had a bad taste, also had odor , could not eat it. (not fresh).   The chicken was rubbery. The crabcakes were very soft,salty and burnt on the bottom . Although the service was good. The ambience very nice- warm and inviting in a house turned into restaurant.  I have etoufee all the time cooked  by my Louisiana friends  and this did not taste the same. I will not go there again. I was the only customer for that hour."}

{"text":"I would give it 4.5 stars if halves were allowed, but oh well.  Great food, great atmosphere.  We loved the idea of the house made into a restaurant - warm, cozy, very inviting.  Cannot say enough about the food - we had cornbread, fried green tomatoes, seafood gumbo, and all-in Diane.  Waitress was very attentive, almost annoyingly so, but they were very slow when we were there.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We were excited to see that a new restaurant has opened in Cornelius serving Cajun food. The Creole House is located on Main Street, across from Ace Hardware.  Some things were really good, such as the location (a quaint old house), the music, and the service.  (Service, in particular, is very important to us.)  The bar area is small but really nice -- so nice that some couples were even eating in there!  They even have an outdoor seating area on the front porch for when the weather is warmer.  However, some things could be improved.  Our table was a little bare -- it only had a salt and pepper shaker and a small candle, but nothing else.  The wall above our table needed something on it as well.  Some of our dishes were great, others were just average.  The crawfish poppers were really tasty, but the portion was a bit small for the $8 charge.  My crawfish etoufee was also a rather small portion size (smaller than Cajun Queen's), and I was not fond of the tangy flavor.  However, my husband's blackened ribeye was really good -- cooked perfectly and a good portion size.  Since this is a new restaurant and they have much going for them, we will definitely give them another try."}
{"text":"This would be at 4 1/2 starts if they did that.  Went for a dinner last night.  Timing of service was excellent. The food was well prepared and flavorful.  We split the Trio of Sauces and added in a couple of appetizers.  Tack on desert and I'd say the portions were correct.    We chose to sit on the porch and enjoy the R&B/Blues guitarist.  I highly recommend giving this restaurant a try.   We are definitely going back."}
{"text":"Highly recommend, we will be back. We love having a new quaint restaurant so close to home. Great place for romantic dinner, inside or out. Beautiful, fun decor; wonderful food, appropriate portions; friendly staff. We have tried the etouffe, ribeye, fried green tomatoes - all were delicious!"}
