{"text":"Ohhhhh ho ho, want to have spicy west indian roti, or paratha, make it this place, this place has very good roti, be it chicken, beef, daal or my favourite GOAT roti, yum yum, if you want spicy this is what you need. After you're done with your meal I'd suggest try their home made coconut icecream, not the best texture, but veryyyyyy good flavor. The service is pretty fast and the people are very friendly and if you're muslim and religious, all the food is halal, wicked eh?"}
{"text":"Really great hole in the wall roti shop along the bustling, integrated, and variety-filled strip of Queen Street West.  You can't (as far as I know) get Indo-Caribbean food in Chicago so my fiance and I were craving a double or roti as soon as we landed in Toronto for New Year's Weekend.  The storefront itself is deceptive because the inside is rather large, with plenty of seating.  Together we got the beef and chicken roti, separately assuming we could each stomach our own. We were both way off as the portions of the roti are as other reviews state - hefty - but delicious. The curry is well spiced, with just enough kick where you can still taste the meat and the roti shell is perfect.  Customer service here is friendly and attentive. More importantly, the product was great for the price and quickly prepared.  I can't compare this to nearby Bacchus but I can certainly say that Ali's is as good as any other roti I've had."}
{"text":"I used to go here exclusively for roti...they are amazing here. I usually mix pumpkin with spinach in my roti but sometimes crave the potato and channa.  ...And then I discovered the doubles. Like a lot of people on here, these things are amazing. Ali's doubles are full of many flavours - although I sometimes find the dough to be greasy. Don't let that stop you from trying them - they are awesome!  I find their food to be really well priced here but find the drinks to be slightly on the pricey side.  This place is a must when looking for comfort food while in Parkdale."}
{"text":"Where to begin? So I see that the other reviewers on here are liars, don't know what flavour is, because this place, is lacking in that department. My girlfriend and I went for dinner, it was our first time there and our last. I ordered a shrimp roti, she ordered rice and peas with some strange looking chicken (asked for fried), and we each got a double and a bag of cold, stale pholourie.   The doubles were good, if I were judging the meal based on the doubles alone, I would have given 5 stars.   So the shrimp roti: The curry wasn't flavourful enough, no heat, no kick, just watered down yellowish brown sauce. The person who wrapped the roti did a terrible job, I had five bites of plain roti before I could get to the curried shrimp and potato.   The rice and peas/chicken: The rice was very bland. The chicken was under-seasoned and didn't smell appetizing. The only enjoyable part of the dish was the side salad.   This was my girlfriend's first time trying Trini food at a restaurant and as a Trini man, I am ashamed to have taken her to this place.  She said the best part of the dinner was the bottle of Ting she had to wash down the flavourless food.   I would not ever go out of my way to go to this restaurant. If you're in the area and feel for a double then sure, but don't spend money on anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Ali's has some great rotis, all served up in a dining area with a wacky wraparound mural of island vistas. You can tell it's the real deal because there aren't any honky poseurs around, only real West Indians.  In addition to a wide roti selection, they've got some great appetizers and side dishes. With our roti we tried an aloo pie (a kind of tasty potato turnover) and mango anchar, which was covered in a delicious tamarind goo. The only downside is that \"for here\" gets you the same packaging as \"to go,\" only on a tray; had to go back and ask for more plastic utensils and napkins, especially since it was all pretty greasy."}
{"text":"Review based on chow mean, 2x chicken roti, and jerk chicken dinner.   Overall, I just dont think I like Roti - Im not going to hold that against Ali's. If you like Roti I think this would be a good place.   I do like curry, and this place had good curry. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for a top notch roti.  I had the beef roti and it was very tasty. Well spiced, pepper was nice, under $10 bucks and decently big.  Bias: my dad says he's been coming to this place since the 90s so I was more critical but this roti has held on to its game!"}
{"text":"So to start the doubles are great, probably the best in the immediate area. The chicken roti is a 3.5. The goat with rice and peas were tiny peices of flavor less meat and waterdowned curry grazy. The chicken chow mein was by far the worst. They are very stingy with the hot sauce. I ask for extra pepper in the roti everytime and either they forget or feel the amount they put is fair. Then the hot sauce on the side is so tiny but it is what it is. Service is quick and freindly. So in short great place for doubles avg place for chicken roti and im not a fan of the rest."}
{"text":"Ali's is my go-to place for some authentic Trini roti. I think it's by far the best roti shop in Toronto, but ofcourse I may be biased. Afterall I have been eating here regularly for the past five years.  Ali's is a no-frills place with very friendly staff - both in the kitchen and the ones that take your order. You can eat-in or take out (I almost always do the later since the restaurant is not designed for ambiance (unless tiles, bright lights and metal chairs is what you want)).  My favourite is their signature dish - the roti. I've tried all possible combinations but chicken roti is the clear winner, closely followed by chickpea-pumpkin roti. Lately I have started switching to the vegetarian version (you can choose or combine chickpea, squash, spinach and potato). On the downside I've noticed that their roti shells are occasionally not fresh, but that's rare.   My second favourite dish is the chickpea sandwich aka 'doubles' which is a simple arrangement of curried chickpeas between two fried flat breads (think 'puri' from India). The fritters, drenched in oil, are a must to satisfy your junk food craving. How bad can they be? They have chickpeas, that makes them extremely healthy junk food (yeah right)!  The place also has some other west Indian fare, such as cassava and some imported drinks. Try the coconut icecream.  As an added bonus, you get to see entertaining sights while you wait for your food, such as people with \"East-Asian\" features speaking with a Trinidadian accent (Read this: http://priyank.com/weblog/2009/11/11/foreign-languages-in-toronto/)  Enjoy!  Secret tip: Ask them to add tamarind chutney to your roti or doubles, they won't automatically do it."}
{"text":"This roti shop has a lot of things a trini will crave, it has current rolls, stew chicken, rotis, etc. The roti is delicious and is good value for money. It does remind me of the ones back home This is a Trini style roti, not a Jamaican one, which I appreciate. The portions are generous unlike some other roti shops in Toronto."}
{"text":"Ordered a boneless chicken yesterday! Have to say I didn't quite enjoy it that much..mostly because I do not like the taste of lil chunks of ginger in my foods! But that's just me lol!"}
{"text":"Ordered doubles and aloo pie, both were taken from beneath front counter and thrown in microwave. Dried out, burnt tasting chick peas. Wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"Never had west indian food before except at friends' homesI am indian and am somewhat familiar with west indian food.  I was very unimpressed with the food. It was very average.   I would not make a special trip to go there."}
{"text":"Bacchus roti is better. But Bacchus is often closed. And the homemade coconut ice cream at Ali's is seriously off the charts - a true secret of the city. And Ali is a lovely guy. A solid second choice."}
{"text":"I went to Toronto with my wife and a friend for the CBC Music Festival. Since there isn't anything close to authentic West Indian food in Metro Detroit, we were definitely going to get some roti.   We'd never been to Ali's before but we will most certainly be back. While I miss the sauce that Coconut Grove ladles over the roti, everything about our lunch at Ali's was top-notch.  Service was stellar. The food was out-of-this-world (goat roti all around. The location is hard to beat (easy to get to but far enough away from downtown that it's not swamped). I'm definitely going to recommend Ali's to anyone who will listen.  As a bonus, when we were leaving the gentleman behind the counter (Ali?) gave each of us an Ali's Roti pen - w00t!!"}
{"text":"Convenient roti stop on Queen, and I could park on the street, walk in for a goat roti, and be out in 15 stuffed beyond belief.  Compared to other roti places in town, this one gets it the most right.  When you walked in, the ambiance and clientele reassure me that this place is legit.  Pricewise, this place is in line with Island Foods, but manages to be slightly better in every imaginable way.  The overall roti is bigger, and has a layer of chickpea flower that Island food misses out on.  Inside, the chunks of goat meat are equally as impressive, with what is seen as a slightly better meat to potato ratio.  Service was fast and friendly, and would make it into my regular roti rotation."}
{"text":"Doubles are always a great cheap filling snack - can customize mild/med/hot or add tamarind sauce. A great bargain and when I'm hungrier I enjoy their rotis, plates, or even the oxtail stew. Can't really go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Tried their curry duck which came with rice and peas and a small salad.  I wish they had asked me if I wanted any dressing on the salad but other than that, I had no real complaints with my meal.  The duck was nicely tender and seasoned.  And the hot sauce packs a mean punch!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a caloric splurge.  The roti is absolutely massive, and on its own, enough to incapacitate you for the remainder of the day.  You could choose to make the reasonable choice and not finish it, but it's so good and it keeps asking you for just one more bite. And it doesn't end there.  Cause you gotta get a double too.  The doubles, which based on the wrapping look like they're 90% pure lard, are absolutely delicious and melt in your mouth with fried doughy goodness.  My only saving grace is living downtown, where I can justify this place by the one hour walk there and the hour walk back.  The staff are always friendly and helpful. Everything takes about 10-15 minutes to prepare fresh. Definitely worth the cheat day :)"}
{"text":"Great place for cheap eats. Vegg options are all great, portions are generous, and the hot sauce is awesome."}
{"text":"Best West Indian/Trini roti shop downtown. Everytime I tuck into a chicken roti I am reminded of my grandmother's cooking. The owners are super nice and they are really awesome to all of their customers. Polourie is a bit heavy but the doubles are awesome. Need to try the ice cream next!"}
{"text":"I think this was one of the first west Indian places I tried in toronto when I was a kid.   I guess I always liked it cuz we have the same name :)   I really like the doubles here and also the goat roti, but any of the rotis are great. They don't put as much filler potatoes in the roti like other places so I really like that, and the goat is boneless too.   The doubles are decent but I'm still having trouble finding a doubles place that I love.   They've got their own hot sauce which is pretty damn tasty."}
{"text":"This area is starting to be my go to for a fix of west Indian food, and little by little you don't fear or your life up here anymore! Ali's delivered a massive roti that packed a lot flavor and good spice if you ask for extra pepper on it. Beware as it will make that nose run!! Happy Dining!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a Roti yesterday. Huge and quite nice. Next time I will go for a little extra hot sauce or maybe the goat. Nice service."}
{"text":"So I've been reluctant to try out this roti shop because the exterior is more reminiscent of a Subway sandwich shop than a Caribbean restaurant. I've come to realize that because I learned to love roti sitting on the kitchen floor of the Trinidadian lady next door when I was 5 years old, I don't think good roti can come from any place that doesn't approximate that experience.  Ali's West Indian Roti Shop proved me wrong. Really wrong. Even if I take off points for not having hole-in-the-wall street cred and preparing the food out of the sight of diners who want to know what's going on with their food, I have to rave about how good this roti is! A perfect dahlpuri wrap with that wonderful yellow stuff underneath (the friendly lady behind the counter told me this was split peas). Nicely textured and flavoured curry filling that seems to be seasoned for Canadians, but would easily be elevated by the addition of some hot pepper sauce (Grace, of course!). Ample serving sizes meant two chicken rotis fed four people back at my house and Ali's seems to have figured out how to put together this delicious package without grease soaking through to the paper bag.  Like the other roti purveyors on the block, Ali's runs a clean shop and if you can get past that feeling that you're at Harvey's or Subway, then you can enjoy roti while looking at starving artist sale oil paintings of a vaguely Caribbean landscape.  Ali's wins my prize for best roti at Queen and Lansdowne."}
{"text":"HOLY SHT THESE TRINI DOUBLES ARE OFF THE CHAIN!   I cant handle it, the cravings are worse than being a heroin addict! I want those doubles in my mouth every second of the day.  The way they prepare them is so unreal its like no other double that i have had before.  Lightly crisp on the outside tender in the middle with chickpeas that are curried perfectly and too top it all off they have the most UNREAL TAMARIND sauce for them!!!!!   Trust me on this one best doubles in Toronto hands down!"}
{"text":"Whenever someone says roti. This is the place I think about all week until my cravings are satisfied. This is my go to roti shop now.  Note: This is West Indian roti. Make sure you understand the difference because it may be a different style you're looking for.  My go to order is the chicken roti. Which is a chicken stew filled roti. The chicken is juicy and tender, seasoned with curry and spices. If you want some extra kick of spice, you can order their hot sauce separately. Word of caution - it is really spicy! I have also tried their delicious doubles which you can't go wrong if your you just in for a small snack. And they also have beef patties, which brings me back to my childhood, but they're just okay. The only thing I wished they had were samosas.  The owners are a nice bunch and always welcomes you like you're an old friend in town. They also come and serve your order to your seat when they're not too busy.  I'll be back. No questions asked."}
{"text":"Got the jerk chicken, definitely good stuff. The chicken was tasty, spicy, and cooked well. The sauce was great.  I wish we has this in Boston! The only downside was that the bathroom wasn't open. The person at the register (not sure if he was the owner) was a very nice guy. I wasn't sure what I should order and asked him and Jerk Chicken was one of the suggestions. I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Ali's for their roti for the past 15 years or more. Their chicken and goat roti are very tasty. They offer enough flavour and sauce, as well as a great house-made hot sauce. However, when I recently tried the oxtail soup, I found it completely unpalatable. The little pieces of oxtail were mostly gristly, the meat was chewy, and just plain old tasting. The broth was \"off\" probably from the old pieces of meat. Also, the soup lacked the body, substance, and ingredients of a typical Caribbean soup. Instead, it was strangely overrun with an abundance of potatoes, celery, and carrots. Caribbean soup must have dumplings, cassava, edo, sweet potato, yam, and/or green plantain in it.  Needless to say, I am remiss to try anything else at Ali's ever again.  I'll just stick to the roti's."}
{"text":"Delicious Roti! If you want it hotter, dump more of the scotch bonnet hot sauce on it.  Dont mind the cheesey oil paintings of island mural on the walls, as soon as you get your food you'll be happy. Great deal!"}
{"text":"I will be honest - I definitely wanted West Indian food, but came here because Bacchus was closed.  I was initially put off by the large, tacky signage and the interior murals.  My fears were quickly allayed once my double and GOAT (greatest of all time, for you LL Cool J fans) daal puri came.  Holy hell, was it all good.  I love me some good goat, and this was wonderfully tender and fatty.  The double was also amazing.  Hooray for West Indian food."}
{"text":"Solid. Had the channa roti. Great flaky dalpuri roti. Great portions, swift service and cheap. Will be back."}
{"text":"So like many others, I crave the doubles.  If you have never had a double, it's a must experience.  I had my first double years ago at this little West Indian grocery store at Hurontario/Dundas in 'sauga. Ever since then, I haven't found anywhere that makes them. To be honest, I haven't REALLY tried that hard to look for 'em... but when I moved to Parkdale and found this roti shop, I knew they'd have them. Bingo!  First off they're cheap.  Second, they are vegetarian.  Third, they are AWESOME. Filled with chicpeas that are curried, perfectly spiced. If you like it spicy, as for hot. YOU WILL GET HOT.  I haven't ever eaten them with the tamarind sauce, but I would imagine it's great.   Soft chewy patty, delicious chickpea filling.  Just go. They rock."}
{"text":"So good. You should definitely come here hungry and get the doubles as an appetizer. Had the boneless chicken paratha roti and was extremely tasty and filling."}
{"text":"It's always telling when you see people of a related culture actually lining up to order from a restaurant.  Out of all the roti shops in the downtown core, I've seen more actual West Indians here than I have anywhere else.  The roti shells themselves are pretty good (prefer the Paratha myself, since the Dhalpuri ones tend to have a slightly too-dry-mealy-for-my-taste middle layer), and they sell them separately in case you want to fill them with your own stuff.  My favourite is the shrimp roti, but their beef, chicken, and veggie ones are good, too.  My only issue is that they can all be a little too moist (by the time I get the paper bag home, it's usually thoroughly darkened by the leaking juices).  If you can handle it, ask for it hot and they'll add a schmear of their hotsauce - it's not too blazing, just right and delicious.  Great doubles (at a great price), too - I love perfect doubles dough (light, with just the right amount of chew), and they get it right.  Affordable, friendly and damn fast (I think my last roti order was out and hot in about 3 min, so you don't have to order in advance)."}
{"text":"Since Island Cuisine in North York closed down and I'm too far from Pickering to satisfy my need for I Heart Roti, this has been my greatest discovery. Generously filled, deliciously spiced dahl puri roti filled with pumpkin (!!) and an assortment of other fillings. Service was incredibly kind and pleasant, and that alone made it worth it. I have been here 3 times in the last week with different staff, each time bowled over by the sweet cashier at the counter and the amazing food.   Doubles are huge, greasy, filled perfectly and utterly satisfying. Make sure to ask for pepper sauce on either if you like it hot. Their house pepper sauce (or whatever bulk brand they may be purchasing) is definitely spicier than your Grace variants and has a great watery texture as well. I personally prefer the general spice and salt level here than Bacchus, as I've yet to be disappointed by watery, bitterly spiced or turmeric loaded curry gravy.   Look, I know Mother India is right down the street (and I'm a huge fan myself - perhaps even edging it slightly over its sister Gandhis) but consider this: when I leave Toronto once again after this brief visit back home, it's going to be Ali's roti tucked in my carryon to eat on the plane ride home."}
{"text":"Ali's Roti is very good.  Of special note is their hot sauce or \"pepper\".  If you don't have a taste for spice, make sure you ask for \"light pepper\" or you'll get damaged.  Their pepper is AMAZING.  So tasty and hot and they aren't afraid to use it!  Their doubles are great too."}
{"text":"Food is ok, although our order was missing some items, when I called in the women who answered literally yelled at me.  Customer service is horrible!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I grew up in a suburb with a fairly large West Indian community and spent my formative foodie years eating some of the best and spiciest dishes I could get my filthy little hands on.  So imagine my infinite sadness when I moved West to the city only to realize West Indian meant solely Jamaican.  Not that I don't love Jamaican food, but there is only so much Jerk chicken one can handle. And so for the last three years I have made it my mission to find decent doubles in this city.  A mission that has taken me to some very, um, \"interesting\" places only to leave me gravely disappointed and sometimes scared for my life.  I had almost resigned myself to making a bi-weekly trek to Scarlem to stock up on the tasty little buggers and then the awesomeness that is the Internet led me to Ali's.  Hot, delicious, with a solid amount of spice and not at all runny (like some of the other doubles I had encountered), Ali's is my night in shining fishnet shirt.  And the best part?  You don't have to take the RT to get there.  :)"}
{"text":"Owned by Muhammad Ali and Ali Larter, this shop knows how to do Doubles. They may also know how to do Double D's, but I haven't had the nerve to ask.  What to get: Doubles. What else: Ali want are doubles.  If you haven't had Doubles before, you're missing out. They're a Caribbean specialty, they're spicy a.f., they're vegetarian, and they're absolutely wonderful. They have chick peas aka Garbanzo beans in them and I have no idea what else. I don't want to know. I just know they're amazing.  There are plenty of places in Brooklyn to get them, none better than Royal Bakery. In Buffalo, Michelle's makes them amazingly. And here in Toronto, Ali's is the place to go. They are absolutely perfect here. Wet, spicy, delicious. And of course dirt cheap (less than $3 Canadian and very filling).  The guy who runs this place is really friendly too and his prices are great. There are lots of other amazing things on the menu such as Rotis, and you may also want to sample their baked goods such as the awesome Currant Roll. Do not miss Ali's, in the best and coolest part of multi-ethnic Toronto.  And don't be surprised if you see Ali Campbell of UB40, Ali Son Sheedy, and an Ali Cat here too. They all love doubles almost as much as I do."}
{"text":"Man, this place is good. Their doubles are AMAZING. Tamarind sauce, BEAUTIFUL. Pholourie, DELICIOUS.   However, a bit pricey but worth your money. I have yet to try to roti dishes, but everything I tried was amazing. I'd have to say this is the best doubles place in Toronto (Caribbean Roti Palace was my favourite, until they closed down but this place is very similar to it, just more pricey)."}
{"text":"Great place for a bite to eat. Big portions made fast. Didn't find it to be all that special but enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Best Jerk Chicken in Parkdale.No frills,just great food and warm smiles.Super good value."}
{"text":"The service was nice and pleasant. I liked the decor, the island painting on the walls.  The food was ok. We had the king fish very dry and so was the roti. The beef roti was bit chewy."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Ali's roti shop. I tried this place on a whim because I wanted something different and was passing it on Queen Street. The service is friendly and fast. They serve up quite a bit of Trinidadian cuisine with a bit of Jamaican dishes. I tried the doubles which was my first time ever trying the dish.it was good with chick peas, pepper and tamarind sauce. Just wished they let me know about the 25cent service fee when using debit when I called."}
{"text":"Ali's is the best and the #1 Spot for those after the Caribana parade!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today. My west-Indian esthetician told me that this was the one place close to downtown where I could get authentic Trinidadian food. I am east Indian but I have had my fair share of west Indian foods, especially when I lived up in Scarborough. This place is definitely comparable to Drupatis and Mona's Roti up in Scarborough.   Doubles are very very good. Moist fluffy fried dough, with delicious chana in between. The pepper sauce used in the chana is excellent. The roti was delicious as well (chana and spinach), and huge! I ate a quarter of the roti and one double, I was stuffed afterwards! This place is cheap, quick, hearty, and delicious.   There also was ample seating, and friendly staff. My only qualm was that it was very messy to eat, it would have been nice if they wrapped the roti and the doubles better. The lady did give me a container afterwards to hold the roti, perhaps they could offer that to clients to begin with.   Overall a great place for a quick, delicious bite (and leftovers)! Thankful that this place is not too far from my home."}
{"text":"I ate here years ago and made special journey to get some home cooked food when I was in Toronto. The goat roti was superb and the dhalpuri was probably the best I ever had. The paratha and the duck were superb. I was pleased with the oxtail and peas and rice but this was the middle of the pack. The service was prompt, polite and courteous. I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone searching for a taste of Trinidad and Tobago, they literally have every Halal thing you can crave. Clean and spacious."}
{"text":"I got doubles, currant rolls, pholourie, Peardrax and peanut punch. Everything was on the point. The peanut punch was slightly watery but still did the job. The doubles was so tasty I went back for more. I would of went back after that but the line started to grow. I definitely recommend Ali's."}
{"text":"This is one of the best roti shops in Toronto. The goat roti is to die for.   Also they have delicious doubles. I live in the east end and travel all the way west just for Ali's."}
{"text":"get that s*** hop on the wave stop slacking. I don't care what anybody has to say this is great better than any McDonalds or any fast food restaurant if you're looking for food at a good cost and big and proportions for the money for the price this is the place to be if you're looking to eat healthy this is the place to be I will see you there"}
{"text":"Probably the best West-Indian food I've had downtown. The roti is fresh, tasty and doesn't sit too heavy. Boneless chicken is usually my default setting if I'm checking out a new place, and it was terrific. Spicy, rich and tender, they didn't overdo it with the potatoes and added the perfect amount of gravy.   The doubles are delicious, but I will say they're a little doughy for me. I've always preferred a lighter crispier style. Definitely the place to get my roti fix in the city without venturing too far off."}
{"text":"I had the goat roti and she had the chicken roti. Great service followed up with great food. Definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food at this West Indian hole-in-a-wall kind of restaurant. The food was fresh and flavorful.   Don't confuse this place with your regular indian food. Thanks to the historical developments that Indian people migrated from India to the Caribbean and Trinidad and Tobago. Apparently, there is a vast majority of people of Indian descent present in those regions. They have added a twist to the Indian food and they call it the Caribbean Indian or West-Indian food!   I ordered a Curry chicken long with dalmoth roti. It came with spicy sauce that was fiery and strong. I enjoyed the flavour of the chicken as well as the quality of the meat. It was nice and tender. The curry also had pieces of potato in it. The roti was a bit dry and maybe the chef in house can try make it less dry.   The main host of the restaurant was nice and hospitable.   Overall a good experience !"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visits here every trip to Toronto. The curry chicken and roti is some of the best and the owner is a very nice man. We are loyal customers!   Update: We took some curry shrimp and roti for the trip home.. OMG! I had no idea that this place could get any better. We made it home and were very satisfied with our little bit of Toronto in Michigan."}
{"text":"Sometimes I laugh at what people call spicy(lol)!  This place was terrible.  I called before I arrived to make sure they had sweet squash to mix with the curry chicken roti and Ali said they did.  When I arrived 45 minutes later he said he was out of the butternut squash.  My wife told him we were the ones that called 45min ago and he said he had 35 people come in since then (I guess they all ordered butternut squash).  I seriously doubted that since only 2 people came in within a 30 min period while we were there.  He said if we wanted to wait 30 min he would make some.  Long story short the food was ready in 15 min.  I decided to try the roti there because I was so anxious to see if the food was really as good as people have reported (totally disappointed).  Curry chicken runny, no spice, and NO butternut squash!  After a couple of bites the chicken made my wife sick( I have a tough stomach)  At 38 years old I run away from confrontation.  I paid $20 dollars for food that I gave my dog when I got home.  She loved it!"}
{"text":"I am not a \"Double\" expert, but I found Ali's West Indian Roti Shop quite good.   A good place to stop by for some cheap good food!  The ice cream here is made in house, great for a hot day as it is frozen solid! Soursop flavour was refreshing!  A great pit stop when you are in the area!"}
{"text":"I saw people writing about this place having food just like mother's rotis. I never had West Indian rotis before, but I swear if I had a West Indian mother, she would make rotis like these. Wow. Super yum!   I first walked in thinking, man $13 bucks for this paratha stuff? I don't know if I actually want it. But the guy at the counter just had this solid look like, hey, my customers appreciate me. So I took the dive. It didn't look like much. But then I tasted it, and boy was I wrong! The rotis are heavenly and the goat curry went perfectly well with it. Definitely one of my new favorite spots!  *Disclaimer: I was very hungry before walking in, but I'm sure it's still good"}
