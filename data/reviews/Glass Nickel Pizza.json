{"text":"Pizza here is most definitely a step up from some other places around, price wise it's a step up too. They have a big selection of \"unique\" pizzas, think Thai food on a pizza, most of which I've found to be a one off thing, but still interesting. I'd rather give this place a 3 1/2 but perhaps I'm just spoiled, haven't ordered from a different pizza place in probably almost a year."}
{"text":"papa nickels was 1 of me fav pizza stores in town n me mouth wood SALIVATE over der delish pizzas cuz they were me fav...NOT NOW!!! i hope sum1 reads dis review cuz they get very snippy on da fone when u call dem!!! i called dem cuz they said they wood deeleaver me pizza twenty mininuts EARLY even doe i order it 4 a specific tyme...I HAD 2 TALK 2 3 PEEPS AT PAPA GLAZE NICKLES!!! i had 2 listen 2 all of dem interrupt me n then listen 2 da nice killer guitar songs when they put me on hold.

{"text":"Just ordered a small gluten-free pizza today, used the online option. Even though we *technically* did not qualify for a coupon, the nice lady on the phone gave us a discount regardless since we almost qualified.  The pizza is a bit overpriced and took almost an hour to deliver (by that point I was pacing back and forth nervously downstairs), but it proved to be worth the price and the wait!  I mean it was DELICIOUS, and while I am usually a picky eater who gets full from one slice, I ate like 3 and still wanted more!  Overall we were VERY satisfied with pizza quality and would definitely order again (probably a larger size next time, if that is available as a gf option).  Either way, I recommend this place to all fellow gluten-free pizza lovers! :)"}
{"text":"I find that this pizza is edible but I am confused as to why so many people think it is so spectacular-it seems to be pretty standard delivery style pizza. They have a number of non-standard toppings and specialty pizzas so that might be part of the appeal to some but I prefer plain cheese or just one topping so the quality of the sauce, cheese and crust is most important. This pizza just seems very dough heavy to me which can result in sogginess-if you like thicker crust pizza you might like this place whereas if you like thin crust pizza you probably will not."}
{"text":"Good pizza. It wasn't as hot as I'd have liked it, but that's because it was delivery. The ingredients tasted fresh, and the sauce is extremely tasty. A bit on the pricey side, but definitely worth it for a quality pizza."}
{"text":"best delivery pizza you can get in madison - i LOVE the ranch pizza with bacon and chicken.  but it is a splurge...not your $5 papa johns deal.  definitely worth it if you're in the mood for great pizza."}
{"text":"I love this pizza. It's not the cheapest but I like the flavor. They have inventive combinations and use fresh toppings. It is my favorite Madison pizza."}
{"text":"I don't know why people think this is the end-all, be-all of pizza in Madison. Pavlov's clearly has them beat on that count. But, if'n you want a killer cheap salad, this is your place. You get to choose your toppings from among their mongo list of salad toppings, or go crazy and pick pizza toppings for your salad.  If you must get the pizza, go for the chunky sauce or the pesto. The regular sauce is *yawn* boring."}
{"text":"I brought 7 teenage boys to the University Avenue location; they were patient as we bumbled around deciding what to order, and our food came out quickly.  As always, it was delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Sigh, so many inexperienced pizza eaters here. Really, 4-5 stars? I can see possibly 3, but 4 or 5, wow, ever get down to Chicago, ever? This is crap pizza by Chicago standards. Good enough for Madison perhaps, and that's just sad. Thin, thick, deep-dish, stuffed, take a road-trip to Chicago and try it all, you will then know how to judge pizza. When desperate and stuck in Madison, this could do, but it sounds like Pizza Brutta would be a MUCH better choice. Of course they won't deliver to you, so you'll have to actually drive there. But in the end the pizza you will get will be such a better experience than this stuff. And yes. GNP has it's time and place, but best to avoid it if you can. It is better than Dominoes, Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, Little Ceasars, etc. but certainly not better than a real pizza place. I've had better pizza in Lake Geneva ffs, and that's not including the Gino's East there (which of course is from Chicago). yada yada yada, the best bet in Madison is to do the research and make your own pizza, it will certainly be better than GNP. The best part of GNP is the online ordering and the choices they offer. The problem is when I check \"well-done\" and then even write in, \"well-done please :)\" it is never well-done. blah blah blah, if you're high, I'm sure it's much better."}
{"text":"Would have given 0 stars.  Horrible service...eh food.  We LOVED everything we ever ordered from the west side location and had amazing customer service so we were pretty excited to be moving a block away from a Glass Nickel in Sun Prairie.  We have been disappointed pretty much EVERY time we've ordered.  I think we keep trying with the memory of the past, but after last night we are done.  Ordered shrimp po boy sandwich and fried cheese ravioli...shrimp was tough and chewy and ravioli was filled with meat.  I don't eat meat so I didn't want to eat the appetizer and called to let them know(in a cordial way).  Pretty much gave me $10 credit and hung up on me.  I hope this place just closes up, waste of space."}
{"text":"It's pretty expensive considering the food is just ok. There's a great lack of...flavor in everything.  I've ordered from here several times, each time getting something different off the menu. It's close by and I was too lazy to go through the yellow pages to find a new place.   But yeah, just not worth the prices in the end.  I'd rather just walk to Walgreens and pick something up. :p"}
{"text":"This review is about the Atwood Glass Nickel only. I've not been to their other locations.   The best food to get here: Specialty Pizzas, some appetizers (Tots and Cheese!), and the Salads. Seriously, these are the best salads on the east side.   Is it a little pricey? Maybe. But if you want delivery, it's convenient. You can pay online and you don't need to use cash (unlike a lot of eastside establishments). And although their tap selection is modest, it usually has some decent, notable beers.   A word of warning: If you're doing take-out, the food seems to decline in quality. A few months back, on a Friday I met a friend for lunch. I got the fish and chips. They were good. Not the best, but not bad for $10. Then, a couple of weeks back, I ordered the same thing for take out. Not good at all. Two tiny pieces of fish, less than a handful of floppy fries; the cole slaw was FROZEN solid, and the tartar sauce was some Sysco packets. I mean, come on. IT'S WISCONSIN. We eat fish like every Friday. Get some mayo and relish and make some tartar sauce. How tough is it? I've had better (and cheaper) fish fry on State Street.  I tried their pasta the other day. Not good. Paid $10 for six Ravioli and some sad drips of sauce.   Stick to the pizza.   I think that the GNP is a great place to go with a friend, get an app and some salads or a Specialty Pizza--but despite a really comfortable interior, sometimes the servers are rude, which is ridiculous. East-siders are great customers.   If you just want a solid pizza with good sauce, or a good sandwich, you're better off heading down the road to Harmony.   Glass Nickel Pizza is okay, but used to be better. I hope that they get their groove back."}
{"text":"We went here last Thursday night at 9:30 pm. We shook the bell on the door yelled hello and no one came out after ten minutes we left.  Website said you were open until midnight. I guess not that night. Their food is good. We have ordered food in the past and it was good."}
{"text":"Went there fairly late on a Sunday night and it was not at all crowded (until 20 hockey players showed up, my party) . They managed to get our orders out fast, no fuss, while handling the bar that was suddenly much much more busy than it had been before.   The best part of this evening for me was that they have a new Gluten Free menu! I expected to maybe be able to get a salad, but their crust was only moderately more expensive (4$ for GF crust) and there were plenty of safe toppings. It was thin, but not soggy and stood up to the heavily loaded pizza well.They had Strong Bow cider, and Sprecher's Root beer on tap - two great (gluten free) favorites of mine. The rest of the party all seemed to get served fast, they handled our spike in business with ease."}
{"text":"If you want decent pizza, and that's it, you don't mind messed up orders and rude/snide service Glass Nickle Atwood is your place! The pizza was pretty good,  but wow...the host/phone person whose working tonight is one I hope to not work with again..I also thought it was pretty cool of her to blame other co workers for the order not being correct AND blamed the customer after I had explained there were issues going on online and was wondering if she could help me get these items applied. Did not realize this was not her job and was responded with a snide comment and then I just stayed silent and acted as if I wasn't phased, it was then she could help me...wtf man..anyway..not worth going to anymore, as this is not the first time they've messed up our order and/or had junk of service."}
{"text":"I concur with the other reviewers.  Great Madison pizza place.  The actual restaurant is quite nice, with a bar and a snazzy interior.  Not at all like the kind of red and white check tablecloth pizza joint that you grew up with - with hot peppers and parm shakers on the table, garlic rolls, and big floppy greasy pies, pastas, etc.     Open very late, so you can order from the full menu until 12:30 every night of the week.    I would warn that my experience with their meatball sandwich was not good.  It was a very small and dry little thing - not at all worth 7 bucks.    We liked the Ravioli though.  All pasta dishes come with a generous salad and a slice of garlic bread - all for about 8 dollars.    We liked the Nickel Nugget appetizer.  These are small bits of fried pizza dough, covered with lots of parmesan cheese.  This was probably our favorite part of the meal, and the portion is big enough to make you both not really want dinner."}
{"text":"The only positive thing about Glass Nickel is that they're open late. The quality is horrible compared to what they charge. They have yet to get one of my orders correct (simple things like extra side of marinara and I get ranch) and when I call about it they don't even seem to care. I'm officially done from ordering from them and I don't recommend them to anyone"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison!! Atwood location has nice bar, very good beer selection, and great staff!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza -- the best delivery I've had. Tasty and not too greasy.   LOVE the restaurant's emphasis on sustainability -- they use local ingredients and have a lot of environmentally sustainable business practices.   Fantastic pizza and socially conscious -- we just found our new go-to pizza place."}
{"text":"I just tried to order a pizza for delivery and got a phone call from the general manager saying that they don't deliver to where I live in DeForest.  Except they delivered to my house within the last two weeks!  The manager argued with me saying they never have and told me they don't have record of any orders from my phone number, which I updated when I last ordered online and on their delivery map my address is included.  He basically called me a liar to my face, even though the pizza box from their last delivery to my house is still in the garage waiting to go out with the recycling.  If you changed your coverage area fine, but don't be a jerk to a customer and call them a liar.  I have a medical degree and am not some confused idiot.  Then I got an email saying that my order was being made.  The manager said that they don't deal with online stuff in their store.  Someone needs to get on the same page and be consistent.  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I've experienced in years!  I will never order from this franchise nor any other in the area and will be sure to pass along to my friends how they treat customers.  I was so excited to find out they delivered here only to be disappointed.  It's a shame too, because their gluten free pizza was pretty good.  Save yourself the grief and go to Salvatore's Tomato Pie's instead.  Way better pizza and way nicer people!!!"}
{"text":"I order from here every time I'm in town. One of the few pizza places that still has green olives."}
{"text":"Im new in town & thought I would try Glass Nickel for pizza delivery.  Service was excellent and so was the pizza!  It's my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"This place is actually more of a 3.5 stars.  The pizza isn't spectacular, but it is pretty good.  I'm not a fan of the crust, it's too bready, but the toppings are high quality.  The appetizers are very good also.  The ravioli, cheese curds, and Texas-toast-style garlic bread are all excellent.  The toasted ravioli (with cheese filling - never tried the beef) is particularly delicious and we order it every time.  Even out-of-staters who had never heard of the concept found it tasty.  I guess there is a rule that applying breading to a food item just makes it more awesome.  The breadsticks lack flavor.  Things would be better if they just baked a plain pizza crust and sprinkled some cheese on it.  Another flop was the fried chicken - pizza places never have good fried chicken.  It was greasy and over-fried.  Even KFC is better.  At least they have great subs and pasta.  Other pizza places offer these things but usually they are sub-par.  Not the case with Glass Nickel.  They also have online ordering (a huge plus in my book), fast delivery and I've never had a problem with any of the delivery people.  I just don't get the hype over the Fetalicious.  Every pizza place has a feta pizza these days.  The Sacre Bleu is obviously the superior pie.  Anyway, you can't really go wrong with Glass Nickel, but there are better alternatives *cough* Falbo's *cough* for the west-side pizza consumer."}
{"text":"We got the portobello pizza, cheese curds, and raviolli. Everything was great.  We would go again.  Pizza was cooked perfect."}
{"text":"I recommend the Mediterranean and Thai pie. It's the best pizza that I've had in Madison. The place is cozy, the service is fast other than the delivery. It's a bit pricey but it's worth every penny!"}
{"text":"A very nice pizza shop with a lot of great options. I loved the title on the meat pizza \"cardiac arrest\". Being a vegetarian, I went for the veggie pizza with a lot of great toppings. The sauce on their pies could use some more spice but that is my opinion. I loved that there is 3-4 different crusts to choose from. The thick crust I went with was lovely. Everything tasted fresh and was put together with care.  I had leftovers and I think the flavors got even better after siting a few days. If you love pizza and are in Madison, I recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"So new to the area and everyone said this is the best pizza! While I really enjoyed the hand tossed crust. So good! The chicken Alfredo pizza needed more Alfredo sauce and some garlic. Not enough chicken for my taste mainly mushrooms. The bacon cheeseburger pizza was very good though. The price is pretty steep for what I got tonight. I will try another time and a different specialty pizza but needs to be a lot better then this for me to justify the price!"}
{"text":"The thick crust \"Cardiac Arrest\" (all the meats) was delicious! Thick, crispy crust, lots of Wisconsin cheese, plenty of toppings. Service was friendly and attentive, turn around was fast, prices very reasonable, and kombucha on tap. Couldn't ask for a better experience!"}
{"text":"Tasty, quick, and cheap.  What more could you want?    To be fair, the only pizza I've tried is the much-acclaimed Fetalicious, but this is more than enough to keep me coming back."}
{"text":"The glass nickel has a great variety of pizza and I can't lie its pretty tasty however; that being said its has two major down falls. The first, plan on a solid hour wait for take out if not longer.( that's with calling your order in ahead of time) The place is always packed! The second is take out your wallet, it's not cheap. For a large pizza plan on at least a $25 spot if not more. They do offer coupons but they are minimal and have declined over the years."}
{"text":"Food was good, but site said they had coke, but pepsi was delivered. So, not ok. Site needs to be updated, because these drinks are not the same. Also ordered 2 cokes and only 1 pepsi was delivered. So far, not impressed with the service."}
{"text":"i knew glass nickel when it only existed on atwood where there are now condos and good n' loud. their salads used to be so big that they'd have to tape the plastic clamshell \"bowl\" together to prevent spilling!  alas, with all things come change. the salads we got last night were pitifully lacking in lettuce, and i could tell they've taken to watering down the caesar dressing (it's the only dressing that isn't yet in a pre-sealed packet). i asked to throw some anchovies on my small acropolis, cuz i'm a savory gal, and i got a disgusting amount of them. there were like 20 of them swimming around the feta chunks.  their 'zas are great, i've been hooked on the mediterranean and fetalicious in the past; they also have a shrimp po' boy that'll do in a pinch.  if you call at 10 or later on a friday, expect to wait. that goes for any delivery in the city of madison; it's unreasonable for anyone to expect immediate service when /everyone/ expects immediate service. however, they're trained to say it'll be 45 minutes to an hour, and they almost always show up in under 30."}
{"text":"I swear, every time I come to Wisconsin, I have the best pizza I've had since the last time I was in Wisconsin.  I live in Tampa, Florida, a barren wasteland of thin, New York-style pizza offerings, trying to cater to all of the transplanted New Yorkers who will never think any of it is as good as a \"real pie\" from within the 5 boroughs.  So, Glass Nickel's thick, juicy Deluxe pizza, with awesome cheese and big chunks of sausage and wonderfully tasty toppings was just what I needed, pizza-wise.  I wish we could get a nice Chicago-style pizza like this in Tampa.  Their breaded mushrooms were a little underdone, but still good.  The fried cheese curds were 100% delicious.  And the Greek salad was fresh, crunchy and generous.  in fact, all of the sides were generously sized -- I had two full days worth of leftovers in my hotel room fridge after I gorged myself on this meal."}
{"text":"I'm originally from New York so I love my pizza. I was disappointed when I learned that Wisconsin- the land of cheese- had subpar offerings for pizza. Until I met Glass Nickel. The ingredients were super fresh and the crust had the right amount of bite. I'll be sure to eat again and again here at GNP."}
{"text":"This review is just about the pizza, not the service or atmosphere, as I have only ordered delivery from this place.  The pizza just isn't that good. They have some topping combinations that are interesting, but I've found that most of them just miss the mark. They end up being crust heavy or topping heavy without much sauce or balance. Their salads are primarily watery iceberg lettuce with a few veggies thrown in. Their salad dressings are bagged and uninspired.   I agree that the Mediterranean pizza is their best, but it probably the only thing I would eat if I ordered from there again."}
{"text":"After seeing their food decline in quality, I started ordering from here less frequently.    One night I was craving a salad and went in with a friend.  Before the server even got to our table I could tell from his body language and facial expression that he was less than thrilled.  His tone and language was hostile and rude; actually the worst I've ever been treated in a restaurant.    There are a ton of restaurants in Madison and I have no desire to spend any of my time surrounded by such hostility and negative energy.  Went elsewhere and had a fabulous night."}
{"text":"The pizza is quite tasty but I recommend avoiding their bizarre combinations and sticking with standards.  That means, avoid the goat cheese and cranberry sauce pizza and get a pepperoni and sausage.  Their \"chefs\" have questionable, overly adventurous tastes but their ingredients and pizzas are fresh and yummy when not doused with squid ink and marzipan.  The other tip I will offer is get it delivered.  Their service in the store is dodgy at the best of times and when its busy or any peak mealtime expect it to go downhill fast.  Their delivery service is fast and effective though."}
{"text":"I loooove their pizza here! I've only gotten delivery from this place, and though their delivery takes longer than say Domino's or Pizza Hut, their product is much, much better. I love their unique pizza topping combinations, and their dough and crust is delicious, as well. It's pricier than chain pizza restaurants, but worth it!"}
{"text":"Their pizza combinations are unique, but they work! I absolutely love that their pizzas are of good quality and are not greasy or overly heavy. Don't be afraid to try something you've never had before!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in a long time. Hands down.  My wife and I were in town staying at a downtown hotel. I asked the front desk clerk who he would recommend for good pizza that would deliver. He didn't hesitate, and I'm glad he didn't.  They took my order over the phone competently and didn't hesitate when I said I was staying in a hotel. They brought the pizza right up to the room, beating their 45 minute estimated delivery time easily.  The pizza wasn't overly greasy, there was a great sauce/cheese ratio, and their sausage was the larger kind that tasted very fresh and nicely cooked. I was impressed overall and would be a frequent patron if I lived in town!"}
{"text":"We stopped here while passing through Madison and really enjoyed it. We went to the Madison East location on Atwood. It was easy to get to, the pizza was great, the prices were reasonable, and the service was friendly. As a visitor, it was also fun because it seemed to attract a nice cross-section of Madison folks. And there was a lot of good beer to choose from which is always a plus."}
{"text":"Love the pizza, especially the Fetalicious.  It is somewhat expensive pizza, but is very tasty pizza."}
{"text":"Love Glass Nickel. Great food, kind delivery folks and speedy.  Great place to order late night eats. They will deliver pretty much anything deep fried. I'd recommend the tots and cheese, although, be warned: they're addicting. They will also deliver ice cream. o-O  Their crust is extra delicious. Order some extra marinara for dipping and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of the most delicious pizzas I've ever had, The Fetalicious.  Toppings were fantastically fresh, and combination of ingredients was perfect.  This particular location was nice too.  Quaint little pizza joint with a nice TV to watch golf or some other sporting event that is on.  (We happened to watch the PGA Championship at Whistling Straits that day.) They certainly deserve all the accolades."}
{"text":"Ordered carryout.  Was told 15-20 minutes.  Arrived and then told it would be 40 or more minutes.   Hmm...for carryout, after you told me it would be 15-20?  How about you just tell me the truth that you forgot to put my order in and then make it right so I actually decide to order again in the future?"}
{"text":"The flavors in general are fine and the ingredients fresher than most, but the crust is always gloppy by the time it gets to my door.  I was surprised recently to find out they do not have a clue how to make a  parbake."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza, good ambience, and not too shabby of a drink selection. Their pizzas are more \"thin\" style but focus on the fresh toppings. Typically they offer more vegetable options than other pizzerias. The rotating tap selection is very good for a pizza place. Prices are competitive and they cut you a deal if you order two pies. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the service is usually average and one time i ordered their pizza for delivery and it was pretty cold."}
{"text":"Really good pizza,  and many wild varieties to try.  I'm more a fan of thin crust. So I get their cracker crust. The fried mac and cheese is awesome. Parking is not great though."}
{"text":"Had four different pizzas from the place. One of them was gluten free - the heart attack. My husband said the crust was one of the best GF crusts he has had. We also had the feta pizza, cheeseburger pizza and another that had sweet peppers on it. Super good! One of the best pizza places I have eaten at and I am an out of towner."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town and ton of variety the staff is very helpful and friendly I highly recommend coming here!:)"}
{"text":"we ordered a specialty pizza yesterday. and it was one of the best i have ever had!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza place/franchise. A little pricier than most pizza places in Madison, but still very good. If I had one complaint, it would be that they skimp on the toppings if you order a basic pizza(I.e. sausage pizza, or pepperoni pizza). However, they do a fantastic job with their specialty pizzas (I recommend the ranch or fetalicious)."}
{"text":"Glass nickel pizza is definitely a place to get pizza if your craving really good speciality pizza, personally I get the chicken or chicken bacon ranch. And I am never unsatisfied.  Another thing that is very nice about this place is the fact that you can get not only pizza but other foods and this is very appealing when you want pizza but also are craving fries or foods like that.   Now I do have to say that the prices are a little high when it comes to there food but I'm assuming its because of the fact that they are slightly larger than normal pizzas you can get at places like Pizza Hut, so I guess it's worth the price, and they are never late when I order my pizzas and never have any problems with them.  That being said I am giving them four stars because of the fact that there prices are a little high, I get they are slightly bigger but two large pizzas reach into the 30 to 40 dollar range depending on what kind of pizza."}
{"text":"Worst service I've had in a long time. Which is a shame, because I really like Glass Nickel. We just moved to Sun Prairie and were planning to eat here all the time, but now we will never go there again.  - Went on a Weds night, place wasn't busy at all. It became apparent there were no servers working here - the guy behind the bar waited on our table, which he seemed very uncomfortable doing.  - No proper menus, we were just given carry out menus. No beer list. We were told to \"look at the board behind the bar\" which required us to stand and crane our heads over the partition. - Messed up our drink order and our appetizer. Appetizer arrived after pizzas came out, we asked for it to be taken off our bill.  - After our pizzas came out, NO ONE came to our table again. No one asked how the food was or if we needed drink refills - which we clearly did, everyone had an empty glass.  I will also note that this isn't my first bad experience with this location. I tried to order delivery a couple months prior. The guy who was taking my order was extremely rude. I wanted to order 5 large pizzas and he treated me like it was a HUGE inconvenience for him to take this order, total asshole. I ended up hanging up on him and taking my business elsewhere. I was willing to give them another chance by dining in - but it was a huge disappointment. It all just makes me very sad - it has such potential to be a great place to hang out, but instead it operates like it opened a week ago - awkward and choppy."}
{"text":"I've been eating and drinking at Glass Nickel for many years.  The waitstaff is wonderful, the food is delicious and the drinks are strong.  These days we order delivery about once a week and are never disappointed.  Our order is always received in a much faster time than we expect!"}
{"text":"This review is for delivery service.  Called around dinner time, but did not have to wait to place my order.  The man on the phone was SUPER friendly and it made me happy.  We had gotten one of those \"Nickel Dollars\" coupons in the mail worth $10 so that is why we chose this place, along with Yelp reviews.  We ordered 2 pizzas....... Fetalicious and Sacre Bleu with walnuts.  Happy Guy quoted us 45-60 minutes.  It was only about 40 minutes!  After the coupon and a GENEROUS TIP TO THE DELIVERY DRIVER (DON'T FORGET TO TIP YOUR DELIVERY DRIVERS) we still spent less than 20 bucks.  Oh the pizzas were size small. Anyways the pizzas were delicious!!!!!  I'm getting hungry just thinking about them.  This place is a Yes, at least for delivery service.    PS.  Glass Nickel send me more coupons!!!"}
{"text":"Seriousy!?!?!? Is this really the best pizza in wisconsin? :-( I ordered it in the eve & it was at best \"okay\". I'm from NY and it's not nearly as good as the reviews have portrayed. For point of reference, I tried the \"cardiac arrest\" 10\" as well as the garlic sticks. Honestly, I'm sorely disappointed.  Had I known it would have been this meehhhh I wouldn't have ordered it.  If this is the best pizza gets in wisconsin or in madison specifically, perhaps one should swear off pizza until they arrive in ny. :-( The best part of the Glass Nickel experience was the speedy delivery. Completely uninspiring"}
{"text":"Came in at 5:45, seated right away. Very accommodating. Dave our server was awesome. Super friendly and nice!"}
{"text":"I have been gluten free for years, and this is one of the better gluten free pizzas I have had. And they deliver. I like the different pizza choices :)  The fetalicious is absolutely delicious and I have to say, the bacon ranch is quite good. All in all, I really enjoy their pizza.  One star off for not telling what toppings are gluten free."}
{"text":"The Feta-licious is my favorite pizza, period. And they must crank it out, because I can always get a full pie in under 30 minutes during the dinner hour.   I've only eaten at the location a couple of times. It's nice, but I prefer to take my meal home."}
{"text":"What we had: 14\" Hand Tossed Crust; Standard sauce and house blend of cheeses, Sausage, Pepperoni, Yellow Onion, Ricotta Cheese.  Delivered fast and hot, and getting a call from the delivery man right before he arrived was great. Cost was about $21 + $4 tip.  A bit on the expensive side, but there's no denying that it was damn good. Really good crust, too, crispy, crunchy, and flavorful. I'm not usually one to eat the plain crust from the edge, but there was none of that left either.  -- UPDATE -- Another great combination we had: - Hand Tossed Crust - House Blend Cheese - Hot & Spicy Sauce - Meatballs - Sausage - Ricotta Cheese - Red Onion - Garlic"}
{"text":"Pizza is usually great here. We ordered delivery and it took over an hour. The pizza was a little warm and soggy. I've seen better days at glass nickel."}
{"text":"Glass Nickel has fantastic pizza. The hand tossed crust is my idea of perfection. We had the Boris Karloff pizza and it was just everything I wanted. The pizza came out really quickly and the server was great, too. Then for desert they have something called Nutella Beignets and you are going to need to buy those. They are fried pastries filled with nutella and then covered in powdered sugar. Great experience, no complaints!"}
{"text":"I've had Glass Nickel for take out several times and just recently ate at the Atwood location.  As mentioned in other posts, the feta pizza is the signature pie, but Glass Nickel puts together other good pizzas, both from their deluxe selections as well as made to order.  Ingredients are fresh, and the pizza is tasty and well done overall.  Check out their website for coupons.  I would rank Glass Nickel as occupying the space between your standard pizza place and gourmet-style pizza (do those exist in Madison?).  So next time you feel like heading over to Little Caeser's for their $5 Hot n Ready, spend a few more bucks and pick up something you'll appreciate more."}
{"text":"First of all I'm from New York and I have a very high Stanturf the pizza. I am in Wisconsin visiting for business and really just wanted something that I could order in and enjoy. I got the fetalicious pizza along with a side salad... And it was so good!!!  Definitely not NY pizza but definitely the second best!  Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Delivered in 30 min, not just pizza! Shrimp po boy was great and just discovered the awesomeness called Nickel Bites. Eco friendly cardboard packaging seals the deal"}
{"text":"Nickel used to be amazing.  I don't know if its new management, new cooks, or who is to blame, but the pizza quality has seriously fallen off.  Gave it my last go after a few mediocre pies.  The prices no longer justify the ends.  The wings, shrimp po boy (although not authentic), and fried cod sandwich are pretty darn good.  Nothing to rave about but good enough for a late night order.  The menu is very diverse although I am not sure about the quality of the other items."}
{"text":"I heard from a friend that this place has the best delivery pizza in town. I didn't get delivery, I actually ate at the restaurant. Typical pizza joint on the inside. A friend and I ordered the Thai Pie (peanut sauce instead of tomato sauce, chicken, broccoli, red pepper, and onion), and it came out really fast. This place does not skimp on cheese, which I like a lot. Also, the staff was super friendly. I would definitely try their pizza again."}
{"text":"Food was good, but quite greasy. Delivery was frustrating. It took over an hour and a half when I was told 45 minutes. On top of that I was told it was 'on its way' for a good 25-35 minutes. I would not order again."}
{"text":"Super fast, friendly and delicious! Even on a busy Friday night!"}
{"text":"I really like the pizza from Glass Nickel. I've burnt myself out on the feta pizza over the last few years. But my favorite is probably the couch potato. Mmm.   I don't care for the Nickel Nuggets. They don't really taste like anything until you dip them in a sauce. At which point... they just taste like sauce.  Awesome part about them is they deliver, they have online ordering, and they are open late."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of good things about Glass Nickel. This is my first time ordering their  pizza.  I use to always order from another top pizza place.  Since I have tasted Glass Nickel,  I won't be ordering the other pizza place again.  GLASS NICKEL IS THE BEST PIZZA IN MADISON!! AND THE BEST TASTING.  Hmmmmmmmmmmm. The delivery person was very customer service friendly!!"}
{"text":"Very good customer service. My favorite is the Thai pie pizza, it is sooo good!!!!!!! Will definitely keep ordering their pizzas."}
{"text":"This used to be our regular pizza place. However, the online ordering system has not been working correctly. Twice we have ordered and the system has said it was successful, but when we arrive the store claims to not have the order. Rather than taking care of us, the employees are super rude about it. The food is good, but the customer service is terrible. Definitely gone down hill over the last few months."}
{"text":"So I would never have ordered from here due to price, but my hubby had it and got hooked. I will agree the pizza is just amazing. Unique combinations, well cooked crust, quality ingredients. The Ruben pizza makes me wish every pizza company carried it! My only complaint is consistency. The first sacre bleu pizza we ordered was covered in blue cheese, had little if any sauce, no cheese besides blue, and no tomatoes. It was so overpowering we had to doctor it to eat it. The next time we ordered it there was mozzarella, almost no blue cheese, regular sauce and tomatoes. Much better, if it only had the blue cheese! For the prices, I expect there to be better consistency. We don't take a chance on the sacre bleu anymore, which is too bad because it has potential if done right to be great. But they have plenty of other exciting choices. I would love to see them keep the rubenesque, I will be very sad when that ends. This place remains the best pizza I have had in Madison. It has room for improvement on consistency and it is pricey, but wow is it good!!"}
{"text":"Forget the somewhat manufactured-looking decent ratings and do NOT order pizza from this place. As out of towners we were dumb enough to order a pizza and a Caesar salad and were sorely disappointed.   First off, their website is a complete mess...don't even dream of trying to find their phone number on it, much less the price of a pizza. Second...any place that serves up a Caesar salad with what are obviously bagged chicken chunks, and croutons and dressing that come in packets is NOT a three star pizza place. I mean come on people, Madison is practically a Chicago suburb -- you should know what decent pizza is! Thirdly, if a pizza place knows you are ordering from a hotel and one of the things you are ordering is a salad for two, you'd think a couple of napkins and more than one fork would come with your order. Not a chance!  Now, as to the 'za itself: two words come to mind: Pizza Pit. Yes, the fake cheese, over-sweet cheap sauce, too-thick crust and spongy sausage reminded me of the chain places of my own college youth.  As for the reviews that call the toppings \"fresh,\" how exactly can you tell when a greasy piece of processed meat or a sliver of onion is fresh once it's been in a 500 degree pizza oven?  Give me a break.    Despite all this, my husband, daughter and I made a meal of it. Later. My husband and I made a meal of TUMS, and as for my daughter? Well, she woke up with a stomach ache and as of this writing, has thrown up three times. Thanks, Gkass Nickel, for ruining the last day of our vacation!"}
{"text":"So good!  Every pizza I've ever tried there is great.  My favorite is the ranch, and I always have to get cheesebread too.  Not healthy, sure, but SO DARN GOOD.  Look online for a $2 off coupon.  Yay!"}
{"text":"This has become one of our go-to locations for a simple dinner. I've found that pizza places make the BEST salads, and their greek salad is fantastic. We usually get a couple of salads and an order of 'Nickel Nuggets',(parmesan-coated bites of heaven), and a few drinks. The food is consistently good, service a little less so. We've been there on more than one occasion waiting an unacceptable amount of time for someone to come to our table. Not always, but often enough that it deserves to be mentioned- although we've also had super service as well."}
{"text":"This is our family favorite hangout to eat if my son's craving for chicken and spaghetti. Some staff was friendly some doesn't care usually. The food was good  and excellent."}
{"text":"They forgot the buffalo sauce, which made the wings just not the same.  I think they need to be more careful when delivering items without all the requested sides."}
{"text":"My favorite Madison pizza.  I generally got it delivery, but eating in at the East Side location is fun, too.  They're open late, deliver late, and you can't beat the Fetalicious pizza."}
{"text":"I'm starting, or rather, have been experiencing the \"Subway Effect\" with Glass Nickel, where regardless of what you get, everything just seems to taste the same. The pizza is good, but it doesn't leave me wanting more. In fact, it's been quite the opposite lately, as we only begrudgingly order from their because it's convenient, not necessarily because it's so good."}
{"text":"I'm so impressed with the woman over the phone who just took my order that I'm leaving my first ever Yelp comment. Those of you who know me as 'the girl without an online presence' should recognize how incredible this place must be! -Mel"}
{"text":"Glass Nickel is our go-to pizza place. We typically order take out, and it's ready in just 20 mins! They've got \"weird\" specialty pizzas, but you can order normal toppings if you want. I have tried and liked the Socre Bleu, Fetalicious and The Deluxe pizzas. Didn't like the Border to Border, the spiciness overwhelmed the flavor (and I like spicy food).  The restaurant itself isn't a very good environment to eat in. It has that take-out-place-with-a-few-obligatory-tables-and-chairs feel. If you want to go out for pizza instead of ordering in, go to their East Madison location. It's a much nicer place to eat."}
{"text":"This is a simple update.  When I first wrote my review Glass Nickel was indeed the best delivery pizza place I had experienced in Madison but that quickly changed.  Glass Nickel overloads their pizzas with way too many toppings and I'm not someone that really enjoys that.  More shit doesn't make it taste better.  These days as far as delivery goes I prefer Roman Candle whose ingredients are better and seem much more fresh and don't over do it with their toppings, sauce or cheese.  Glass Nickel is still better than DomiNOe's or Pizza Hut or many of the other similar greasy type pizza places."}
{"text":"We were in town for a convention and ended up ordering from here for every meal. The various subs we tried (chicken parm, turkey club, chef's club, veggie) were all excellent. The sub rolls are the perfect crustiness on the outside, chewiness in the inside, and they hold up to the ingredients. The deluxe pizza was DELICIOUS, and I'm not usually a fan of Italian sausage but this was flavorful without being overpowering. The cheese stretched and pulled in the best way, and the pizza was not greasy despite the toppings. The fried ravioli appetizer was also non-greasy and delicious, and the serving size was generous with plenty of delicious sauce.   And the best part? They delivered to our hotel room and the hot food arrived hot, and the cold subs were cold."}
{"text":"Having a dairy allergy in our household limits one's ability to go with the flow of friend's dining suggestions. With the exception of Glass Nickel.  You see, they carry a vegan cheese made from tapioca. The most sincere imitation of the real deal; it pulls, it strings, and it tastes like the real stuff!   They have a two-pizza special where you get two pizzas (10', 14' or 16') for less than you would paying for two, single orders. We got two 14' pizzas for $35 (normally $18.95 per pie).  We got the deluxe with Italian sausage, pepperoni, green peppers, yellow onions and mushrooms with vegan cheese. The other one was the Big Eddy, with meatballs, green peppers, onions and blend of cheese.  The drink and tap menu is impressive, lots of micros and wide range of IPA selections. We tried the Born Again Yesterday by Lagunitas, Sculpins, and a porter. Prices are really fair, from $5 - $6 for a pint.  The pizza crust is the house crust unless specified otherwise. They also do a thin and a thicker crust. I really enjoyed the crusty yet doughy, cornmeal rubbed crust. It had a nice crunch but chewy at the same time, holding it's own against the hearty sauce and toppings.  What an incredible pizza! The ingredients blended in aromatic harmony, bringing smiles with each bite. The other dairy tolerant parties in the group tried the vegan pizza and raved about how unexpectedly good it was, some even preferred the vegan cheese pizza to the other.  Great food and accommodating service."}
{"text":"I've eaten enough frozen dinners to know that their alfredo dinner is just a frozen dinner meal reheated. Same noodles, sauce, and chicken. Same with their jalapeño poppers. Stick to the pizza here, it's decent."}
{"text":"Glass Nickel has the best pizza in Madison, hands-down.  It's a little pricey, but you get what you pay for.  Although I prefer a very basic meat and cheese pizza, they have a lot of specialty pies that my friends really enjoy.  For me, the real key to great pizza is the sauce, and Glass Nickel's is delicious.  I eat their pizza a few times a month, and it is yummy every time.  They also have great sandwiches and other menu items, and a good assortment of gluten-free options.  They also have a full bar with a lot of great microbrews on tap.  You can't go wrong with the Glass Nickel!"}
{"text":"This is pretty fine pizza.  Aside from Pizza Brutta, my favorite Madison pizzas are Glass Nickel and Roman Candle, depending on my mood.  Roman Candle is a little thinner crust, maybe a little bit tastier, but Glass Nickel is thicker, more filling, and heats up better as leftovers.  The Atwood location can be VERY noisy, so keep that in mind.  Not always, but it's not a good place to take a book to read during dinner, or a date who is hard of hearing.  The drinking water at the restaurant has also been pretty mediocre at times.  Normal people prefer a soda (or beer) with pizza, but I've mostly stopped drinking sugary drinks.  I think they used to run their delivery fleet on bio-diesel, but I don't know if that's still the case.  They have a TV or two, but it's not the center of attention, and I wouldn't recommend it as a place to watch a game.  The parking can be tight when they're busy.   Their lot is on the small side, irregularly shaped, and hard to navigate."}
{"text":"Ordered off eatstreet asked for no chicken on the thai pie and vegan cheese. Pizza came with chicken on it and wa svery cold.....we'll just pick it off but when i called to let them know they just said if my order is so complicated I should just call in. no apologies or anything...."}
{"text":"Best pizza you can buy. I order GN every time I get the chance. I have been in love with this place since I moved to Madison a year ago. Service has been excellent every time."}
{"text":"The best pizza I have tasted period. Glass Nickel pretty much ruined me for any other pizza place. I usually order the MEDITERRANEAN  pizza which is my absolute favorite. I also order the spinach cheese bread very often too, its a great deal for $6.25, its more than a meal for me. My husband and I frequently order the cheese bread and a build your own salad. Did I mention there salads are bomb too. They have really unique pizzas you dont find anywhere else. I have never had a bad meal there and there servers have always been knowledgeable, friendly, and fast. glass Nickel must be a great place to work for too because I have seen the same employees there for years.They have an extensive beer selection and have great drink specials as well. One of the places I eat most at."}
{"text":"I give Glass Nickel five stars easily, but only one star to their Sun Prairie location. One of their Glass Nickel pizza driver nearly side swiped our vehicle, honked and flipped us off. All this being about three blocks from the restaurant. He then drove into the parking lane passing us and the van in front of us. The van had to hit his brakes and the Glass Nickel pizza driver nearly hit a parked vehicle. We followed him and parked to report the dangerous driver. I went in and learned as he got out of his vehicle, he yelled at my boyfriend to learn how to drive and F off. The manager inside ensured us that he'd talk to the driver. About a week later we ordered Glass Nickel since we had received a coupon in our email. They didn't apply it, when we called to tell them they said we can use the coupon on our order. This was a coupon that can be used multiple times. They didn't apologize or seem to care. There are other local pizza places in Sun Prairie that will give you great pizza and great service."}
{"text":"The vegetarian pizza was amazing.  We had a 14\" pizza with a beautifully small price tag.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery pizza from them online. It came quickly, and was pretty good pizza. Better than typical chain restaurants by far, and their menu is extensive enough to make it a good place to order from if you and your family want different things! Will order from them again!"}
{"text":"Sausage and mushroom pizza on their hand tossed crust was delicious! I also had their Acropolis salad, it was good except I was expecting it to have its own vinegar and oil dressing. Delivery was less time quoted even with the snow. I would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but not as good as it looks in the photo. Of course, this probably depends on what kind of pizza you like.  We ordered a large pizza for delivery, half chicken cordon bleu and half with 3 different kinds of boars head deli meat and banana peppers.  The chicken cordon bleu had chicken, swiss, ham and not enough pineapple and wasn't very flavorful. We added seasoning to it. The dough/crust is pretty thick and fluffy if you like that.  The other side was better and we ate that quickly. I think the pizza was around 20 or 22 dollars, and while it was good, I wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"Great tasty food. Loved the spinach cheese bread and the fetalicious. Would come again to try other items. Good place to try variety."}
{"text":"The food and service are both very good, I do however wish they where open later on weekdays with me being a 3rd shifter the options can be somewhat limited.  I do appreciate that they have no problem calling when the driver arrives."}
{"text":"So many great choices at this place, it's sometimes a hard decision when ordering but my favorite is La Fiesta pizza. It has such a fun mix of flavors"}
{"text":"WARNING: Watch out when ordering from this location. Apparently they think it is acceptable for you to pay for, and eat pizza which someone else had left the building with and brought back. This is exactly what happened to us on Saturday. We ordered a pizza and when we got there to pick it up the person at the counter informed me that there had been two orders under the same name and the other person had picked up our pizza - but they were on their way back. So he gave me a $5 coupon and told me to wait for them to return our pizza. UH, WHAT!!?? I was supposed to wait there while a stranger brings my pizza back that very likely had their hands all over it and probably ended up on some kids plate before they realized it was the wrong pizza. NOt to mention the 20 minutes that the other person had it in their possession causing the pizza to get cold. No. This did not occur to the people at Glass Nickel. Only after my husband calmly sat down with the manager to explain a potential health code violation did we get them to re-make our order. Un-believe-able!!!"}
{"text":"Their salad was... well, it was more a cheese and bacon dish rather than a salad dish. I ordered food here for delivery and that was a mess. Got a call like 3 times because the person couldn't figure out the location. Just ended up getting frustrated and opted to just pick it up. When I went to pick it up, the girl was rude she wasn't the friendliest person in the world... she wouldn't even fit that category of someone \"friendly\". Anyway, then I wanted to give this place a second chance so came in for the dining experience and it was MUCH BETTER! The waiter was extremely nice, friendly and very attentive! He was awesome! Made up for the rude girl. I like their gluten free crust but when I ordered it for pickup it was burnt and I was disappointed. But when you're hungry, you eat EVERYTHING!!! Anyway, so I would recommend coming in for the dining experience not sure if delivery has it figured out yet. Was also disappointed that I ordered a build my own salad for pickup and ended up getting something I didn't order. Maybe they didn't have spinach? Who knows. Restaurant is pretty clean, very small, and bathrooms were clean as well. I liked the fact that they had a Yelp sticker on the front door. But I wish they wowed me the first time around."}
{"text":"My favorite pizzas they offer are the ones without pizza sauce, which is salty. Their food tends to be salty (maybe so you buy drinks?), not so much that you think the food is salty in taste, but more along the lines of it makes you thirsty for a long time. I do love their pizza crust; it is toothsome & neither thick nor thin.  The location is clean (dining area & bathrooms) with a casual/family friendly atmosphere; the staff is friendly; the food is good. A solid choice for pizza."}
{"text":"Second time ordering from Glass Nickel.  Both times, delivery took 1.5 hours.  Pizza is mostly bread with wide crust.  It is dry -- there's not enough sauce.  Either that, or it all soaked into the crust.  Tonight I ordered a Sacre Bleu, which came topped with pink, mealy tomatoes, raw onions, and ham.  They forgot the salami.  I asked for no walnuts and there were tons and they were all burnt.  The person answering the phone was probably stoned so I had to repeat myself 2-3 times.    This pizza isn't worth the price, hassle, or time."}
{"text":"Had the chicken parmesean sub on sour dough bread. I didn't even come up for my beer, let alone air, until I finished devouring this sandwich. I will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Pizza is great, the 5th star is because I ordered pick up from the wrong location and they were really nice about it when I called back after walking into a different Glass Nickel.  Side note - 100% serious, this happened, the person who took my order has an aunt with a dog, its part pitbill, named Kevin. It came up, don't ask me how. Good dog Kevin. Good dog."}
{"text":"Glass Nickel is always my go to pizza for delivery.  It's not too greasy like a lot of pizza I've tried.  I love the crust and one of my favorite parts about Glass Nickel pizza is how well it reheats.  The crust doesn't get soggy from the microwave and it tastes just fine after a reheat."}
{"text":"Amazing hand tossed crust! The chicken cordon blue pizza is the absolute BEST! Glass Nickel is the one place I HAVE to visit EVERY time I am in Madison!"}
{"text":"there  ok could be better  took em a long time to get my order and food was cold when i got it  and partially burned"}
{"text":"Things to know about me:  Pizza is my favorite food in the world. If I could only eat one thing for the rest of my life it would be pizza. I don't like the average pizza toppings that tend to be used.  With all that, I give Glass Nickel Pizza Co. a solid 4 stars.  We have eaten there once and gotten take out once and both times were great.  Dine in trip we got the Nickel Nuggets (because they didn't have cheese curds) which are essentially just fried pieces of dough served with marinara sauce.  They were okay, definitely not the best dough balls I've ever had, I probably wouldn't order them again, but I didn't hate my life for eating them. We also got a Fetalicious pizza with hand tossed crust that was absolutely phenomenal.  The crust is super tasty, very well seasoned, and is actually worth eating for those who aren't fans of the pizza crust.  I thought the toppings of feta and mozzarella cheese with tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, and red onion worked really well together and everything was cut to a nice size so you got a little taste of everything in each bite.  Seems like a simple thing, but it's amazing how poorly some places make pizza just based on how they cut their meat and veggies.  And the pizza was also delicious two days later after being heated up in a microwave at work in the lunchroom, so bonus points for that!  Second time we got a pizza to go and had friends over to help eat it.  Them being meat pizza people and us being veggie people pizza, we decided to go with the deluxe which is basically a supreme.  However, we decided to take it one step further and customize it to our liking to make it awesome.  Gone with the sausage and pepperoni, in with the bacon and chorizo!  Gone with the mushrooms in with extra spices!  And the best part was, there was no charge to substitute these ingredients (none of them were premium ones) and it was cheaper to sub than to do a build your own!  That pizza was also bonkers awesome tasty and made for delicious leftovers again that I craftily stole (read, got up before him) from the hubs to take to work.  The interior of the actual restaurant isn't really anything special and is laid out kind of strangely. It's not the most inviting or comfortable place to eat, but the pizza is so good, and that's what really matters.  Our server was friendly and helpful, nothing special, but definitely not bad. Would recommend for a general I want tasty pizza for dinner spot!"}
{"text":"The Glass Nickel seems to be one of the more common pizza places around here, in that if I were going to a friend's place and they were getting pizza, I'd probably guess that they were getting it from the Glass Nickel.  I'd say it's slightly better than your average Madison pizza.  But, the average Madison pizza isn't particularly good in my opinion.  There are a couple pizzas from Glass Nickel that are pretty good.  The Santa Fe is my favorite.  Barbeque sauce, onion, cilantro... if you like cilantro, definitely worth trying.  Chicken alfredo is another one that's worth trying.  But overall, I can't get excited about it.  Their \"traditional\" topping pizzas aren't as good as some of their more unusual ones, and a lot of the time that I'm getting a pizza, I want a traditional topping pizza.  I almost always end up getting something else for dinner when I think about ordering a Glass Nickel pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza Pizza!  After a long day of walking around Madison on a cold ass day and doing my own pub crawl, I decided to stay at the hotel for dinner. With no wheels, I call the Glass Nickel and they will deliver right to our room. SWEET!  I get the two 14 inch pizza special, a Deluxe with extra cheese and a Cheesasaurous with Basil and mushrooms.   I'm Here  After waiting maybe 45 mins our pizzas show up. We get settle in and open the boxes. There pies look incredible. I didn't try Cheesasaurous but my wife said it was one of the best thin crust no sauce pizza she has ever had. She is like the Queen of that style of pizza. I got the deluxe with hand tossed crust. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is some good damn pizza. First off it was nice and hot. The sausage was in small chucks which I adore. I hate when I get sausage that is sliced. It also had pepperoni, mushrooms, peppers and yellow onions.  This was a classic pizza which tasted great which leads me to say, that this was one of the best I've had. That is no bullshit.  Verdict  When you are living in a hotel for 6 days, you have no wheels, you are tired, and it's cold as shit outside this has to be your go to place for pizza delivery. They come right up to your room so you can stay in your cozy clothes. On top of that the pizza is outstanding and pipping hot. You folks in Madison are lucky to have this place in your town. Stay Hungry!"}
{"text":"As stated before.... We love us some Glass Nickel and this location knows what is up!  After a couple failed attempts at ordering well done at the Fitchburg location, we were a little nervous to try it here.  But lo and behold.... Our pizza was actually well done!  No doughiness.  Simply perfect.  Our order was ready to go when I arrived and the service was prompt and friendly.  This location is further for us to drive, but it will be well worth the trip because we know we won't be disappointed with our order!  I just wish the experience was consistent from location to location."}
{"text":"After another attempt at ordering our pizza well done from this location, we were greeted with another doughy disappointment.  Unfortunately, I think this means we may have to end our relationship with this location and drive the extra miles to the West Side location."}
{"text":"Our pizza was made incorrectly, was very greasy, and just...blah. We won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Decent pizza, nothing to cheer about.  Other menu items are very good.  Have been there four times and our first visit was terrible.  When we complained to the manager about the brain dead  server he offered a free meal but did not apologize for the idiot who ruined our meal.  You can skip this place and go to Ian's instead."}
{"text":"BEST vegan pizza & options in town. I got a medium thick crust pizza with marinara, vegan cheese, black olives, green peppers, and mushrooms--absolutely delicious. I asked if the garlic breadsticks could be veganized and the staff person told me \"yep! We just won't add a shake of cheese to them.\" Be careful with the breadsticks because I'm pretty sure I ate an entire days worth of calories just from them--SO good! Madison is lucky to have Glass Nickel!"}
{"text":"Three words: Fried. Macaroni. & Cheese.  Glass Nickel calls these \"Little Triangles Of Heaven.\" I'd say they're spot on! Combine with a bit of hot sauce and this appetizer is divine!  I haven't been able to find these treats anywhere else, nor have I been able to replicate the recipe. (Hey, it can't be that hard: tablespoon of macaroni + cheese + deep fryer)  There is also a full bar at Glass Nickel and it's open late night. If you're looking for good pizza, check this place out. Especially, check out those Triangles Of Heaven."}
{"text":"I've not actually been to the location, but I've ordered for delivery multiple times. The food always arrives hot and delicious, and it is simply the best pizza I've ever had. My only \"complaint\" is that the sauce is sweeter than I would like, but to each their own. Its still delicious."}
{"text":"This weekend, we actually ordered from Glass Nickel for their solid salad options. They are reasonably priced, with most small salads being around $5 and large $10. The large is big enough for two servings (could be shared). We had them delivered and it took about 45 minutes to arrive, when they estimated 60-75 on my order confirmation.  Over the past few months, we have tried garden, Greek and the Cobb...all were up to par and so we continue to order. Do not over look as a great spot for salad :)."}
{"text":"Ordered a salad for carry out and got the scraps from the salad bowl. Nothing but stems and huge chunks of lettuce not as good as if I would of ordered it for dine in."}
{"text":"All I can say is yum!  Our favorite for years.  The selection of specialty pizzas and high quality ingredients makes ordering from them a no brainer."}
{"text":"Stopped there last night with my wife, our son and his friend. Deluxe Pizza was 8 bars below Pizza Hut.  Garlic \"also coated with an additional, unrecognizable seasoning\" bread was bar time college grade.  Bowl of spaghetti tasted like plastic (no charge).  Now for the icing... THE STAFF WAS CLEANING A TOILET in plain sight of our table!!  Seconds after she started this disgusting task, the blast of toilet cleaner was engulfing the entire place.  What I really started paying attention to during her toilet cleaning duties was how many times she wandered off behind the bar back to the kitchen and elsewhere.  YOU GUESSED IT, she NEVER washed her hands! Bathroom door wide open, toilet brush in hand, set it down and go do something else..... WOW.  Our waitress was nice BUT.  Never, ever, ever, again."}
{"text":"Gross.  Over priced and disgusting pizza.  I could gotten the same thing from a $3 frozen pizza.  How is this place still in business??"}
{"text":"The people at this Glass Nickel Pizza were very accommodating for a large order of 25 pizzas when I called ahead by four days.  Pizza was on time and all the guests enjoyed the variety of pizza, esp. the veggie selections!  The discount of $2 off/pizza helped a ton too!  Cheers for being very easy to work with!"}
{"text":"My first foraging in Madison was for good pizza -- it took a couple of months but I thankfully found my way to this Glass Nickel establishment and the regular pie; I prefer thin crust but the Glass Nickel regular is thin enough.  Their deliveries are within a reasonable time and are well warm."}
{"text":"Love the food here. I've had their pizzas which are delicious but most recently their chef salad. Don't let the price scare you of around 10 bucks. The salad is HUGE!!!!! Will fill you up for a dinner portion! :-)"}
{"text":"Best pizza & pizza place atmosphere in Madison.  Drinks are awesome.  Don't order the pasta.  Overcooked noodles taste like snot."}
{"text":"I was a fan of Glass Nickel until this last experience. I ordered the Chicken Cordon Bleu and upon eating the last piece my teeth crunched into something hard. I thought it was a chicken bone, which is understandable, but it was instead a piece of metal. Glad I didn't swallow that bite whole!   I called the store that delivered the pizza and the staff apologized for the incident, even offering a credit for next time, which was good, but I wasn't confident in her follow-up for investigating how this happened, so I want to be sure it's not just covered up. Thanks Yelp!  Albeit I was probably unlucky with this, it still ruins this pizza chain for me.   Advise to management: focus on improving practices in your ktichen so don't serve your customers metal-filled pizzas in the future!"}
{"text":"We ate in at this location.  My daughter gobbled every bit of her chicken alfredo.  I had a Mediterranean pizza.  It was good (the Fetalicious is better).  We thought the staff was super great.  Of course we told them we appreciated them as well!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Glass Nickel subscribes to the CPK pizza philosophy.  More is more. Personally, I believe pizza can be delicious by itself, and not simply a vessel for toppings. But I have to admit, Glass Nickel's creations are pretty tasty. Ultimately, I would give Glass Nickel 3.5 stars, but I rounded down because the pies are a bit too expensive."}
{"text":"Ordered from Glass NIckel and it was \"good\" pizza.  Although we had some problems with the online ordering sending out order to a different location then we wanted and then not letting us order again that was taken care of by a good ol phone call.  BONUS:  they let us use the online ordering coupon over the phone.  The pizza was better than most places in Madison with delicious toppings (lots of them and tasty) but still not on par with the down home mom & pop pizza parlors I have been to.  But Glass Nickel, for what it is, did not let me down.    SIDE NOTE:  My wife LOVED the pizza."}
{"text":"I've really never had a bad experience with Glass Nickel. The pizza is always delicious and they have a huge selection of gluten free pizzas to choose from! The variety in types of pizzas you can get here is one of the best parts.   I have had the thai pizza and breakfast pizza and both are so delicious. The Breakfast pizza is a fantastic hangover cure! Delivery is pretty fast and it always arrives hot. The price is a bit higher than other chain restaurants (Dominos, Pizza Hut) but if you're looking for a good delivery pizza that's not going to bust your budget, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Solidly executed American style pizza with a thicker crust and high volume of toppings. The menu offers many atypical toppings. I dined in one time only - it is somewhat of a dive. Typically, I order for delivery and service is as expected. Pizza always arrives hot. Check out the menu online for pricing specials."}
{"text":"I really like the Borris Karloff pizza from here on the cracker crust it is awesome.  I just hate waiting an hour to get my pizza.  The food is great speed of service could be improved.  My only other complaint is when the delivery drivers from here get lazy and call ahead wanting you to meet them in the front of the apartment building rather than bringing your food all the way to your door.  When I order delivery it is because I am being lazy and do not want to put my shoes on lol!  Seriously though the Borris Karloff pizza is a must try just dont be in a hurry to get it!"}
{"text":"I love the vegan pizzas here. The last time I ordered it for my non-vegan fans and they loved it too considering they are fond of cheese and this pizza had vegan cheese. This is my go-to-place for pizza :)"}
{"text":"I love this pizza! I always get thin crust and its always dripping with greese. I dont ever order anything too fancy, but then again I might just have simpler tastes. Never had any issues with service or delivery times. Some of the best pizza Ive ever had! Getting hungry just thinking about it!!!"}
{"text":"Consistantly excellent pizza. Unique options and combinations. Quick service. Seating area is small, but comfortable."}
{"text":"When I heard about Glass Nickel, it was from my boyfriend, who lives in Madison. (I'm a Milwaukee girl!) He knows I'm a big bloody mary fan and would RAVE about the bloodies at Glass Nickel all the time. My hopes were pretty high when he finally took me there, and I definitely wasn't disappointed. They were excellent! The breakfast pizza I had was decent, just a little bland. But the pizza menu is huge - including toppings I never would have thought to put on a pizza, so I'm excited to go back and try some different kinds. It's a small place, so sometimes the bartender is also serving (during lunch hour,s at least) and service can take a while, but the atmosphere was comfortable and the workers have been extremely friendly every time I've gone. Overall, I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"If it was all possible to give GN no stars I would. The community fascination over  this place is beyond me. The crust is me, too chewy and without taste. The sauce lacks good flavor, and while some of the toppings are different it is like putting lipstick on a pig. Maybe the community wants so much to support a local brand so they totally disregard the fact that the product is terrible."}
{"text":"In our quest to dine at all Sun Prairie restaurants... I'm not sure how glass nickel fell under our radar. You can't live in this area without knowing their pizza and once again they didn't disappoint. We loved the atmosphere too.... right down to the trivia pursuit questions at each table."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  I'm not sure why the pizza tastes so much better in Madison then it does in other cities where I've had pizza (mainly on the  West Coast),  there must be something in the air. They have some interesting options for specialty pizzas but I'm not a huge fan of greasy fatty foods so I've only tried the  Fetalicious, Thai ,Deluxe, BBQ, and Mediteranean all which were great. They have some great deals online and delivery is free! Pizza from here is never disappointing and whenever I ask for extra sauce, less cheese, or well done they always accomodate. They aren't as cheap as dominos or papa johns but they also dont skimp on toppings and I've never had a problem with their delivery. They have some other options on their menu besides pizza, I've only tried their spinich cheese bread and their crispy chicken and fries both which were super tasty. I've never been disappointed with the food or the service here so I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Glass Nickel serves the best damn pizza in Madison. This place is pretty far from the center of town, and the price of a pie is a little higher than normal, but if you're willing to suffer through that, there's no reason you should order anything aside from Glass Nickel.   The best thing about Glass Nickel is that there is a massive variety of specialty pizzas to pick from, and that all the different varieties are simply amazing. I have trouble deciding which one to get every single time.   But of the many kinds, the chicken alfredo stands out as my favorite kind of pizza here so far. Instead of tomato sauce, you get a sweet, creamy alfredo, and it's topped with fresh chicken cooked to that consistency where it's a little black and crisp on the outside, and soft and flavorful on the inside. The mushrooms have a strong and noticeable punch, which is a great breather from all the floppy tasteless mushrooms you'll get on any other pizza. Add a little fresh garlic and spinach to the mix, and you get the perfect novelty pizza.  Also definitely worth a try is their fetalicious, which in many ways resembles your traditional pizza while still offering a unique twist. It comes with all your usual toppings - onion, tomato, mushroom, and then they really zest it up with baked feta cheese and spinach. The feta and spinach make for a great combination that adds a kick without robbing you of the familiar, comforting taste of a good cheese pizza.  Above all, the quality of the ingredients they're using is what makes all their different pizzas taste so good. You know your toppings are going to be fresh when you order from here."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Glass Nickel for years on and off. A lot less frequently since moving away from the area, but I sometimes find myself back here or doing takeout with family members when back in the Madison area.   I've only tried some of the more traditional pizzas here--my family members don't have the most adventurous palette--but they've all been tasty. I'm a big fan of their thin crust--surprisingly it holds up well to the grease in the pizza and doesn't get too soggy.   The price isn't too terrible, but it's not anything to rave about. The service is usually pretty standard. They're one of the few places open late in Madison that isn't downtown or a bar, which makes it a good choice for grabbing some late night grub in that city. They also have a cash discount which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Ordered late night the Deluxe, Cardiac Arrest, and feta. They were on time and awesome. Half the people in the room were excited when this pizza showed up so late. They knew and loved it already. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Go here!  Great pizza, good drinks, delish salads.  Fun family atmosphere and friendly service make Glass Nickel a no-brainer."}
{"text":"There are three reasons this place will never get business again.  1: I live in New York.  2: Hours after eating their pizza, I was violently ill.  3: We placed an order for take out, and waited at the bar. They had a great beer selection, and great happy hour prices so we had a few beers while we waited. The person that had taken our order seemed like she was just barely awake, and after asking if a large pizza would feed four, we ordered a large gluten free pizza and an order of wings.  We waited at the bar for about 35 or 40 minutes, buying several of their delicious beers. We finally questioned why our food was taking so long, only for the bartender to return with the smallest pizza imaginable, and our wings--which had been sitting in the back for 20 minutes getting cold.  I asked if the pizza was a large, since that's what we ordered, and he said \"Oh, we only serve 10 inch gluten free pizzas.\" At this point, we ordered a second pie since there's no way we had enough food.   10 minutes after that (and another round of up-sold beer later), we got our second pizza. Nothing was compt from our order, and we were on our way.  The worst part is that the owner was sitting at the bar that night and was either too preoccupied to notice or didn't care."}
{"text":"Another fan of the fetalicious!  Yum in a box.  The veggie is also very good, but really, why order anything but the fetalicious?"}
{"text":"PLEASE TAKE NOTE!! All Glass Nickle Pizza joints are different. This location is by far my favorite, the East Side being my least. The folks on Atwood Avenue need to take note. If it was just one bad experience Id feel different, but it was 3 in a row at Atwood and management didn't back me up. Anyways, Ive had 3 GREAT deliveries from this location in a row, prompting this review. So here goes:  Service - Excellent! The lady on the phone was very polite and efficient, she quoted 45 minutes for a sandwich and appetizer. Quick conversation  and order was finished with credit card in under 3 minutes. Food only took 25 minutes, delivery guy was very polite and equally efficient. Food was hot. No complaints! Was about a 5 mile drive. 10/10  Food Quality - Once again excellent! I had the chicken cordon bleu hot sandwich and deep fried raviolli. Both items were hot and delicious. My only complaint is not enough honey mustard on sandwich, made it a little dry. Next time ill ask for extra. 9/10  Price - My main complaint with Glass Nickle. At least the food and service were great. I paid $17 with tip for both items. A little steep for lunch. Although the portion of fried raviollis was enough, i would have rather had a smaller portion and sandwich for $10 before tip. No sides or chips come with the sandwich, they used too but oh well. 4/10  Overall - 23/30 - 4 stars. If it were a little cheaper it would be 5 easy.  Note - The pizza is also fantastic, the crust could use a little work but thats all my personal taste. This was more a service review."}
{"text":"There are a few Glass Nickel's in the area, but this one takes home the cake! They have the fastest delivery, the nicest drivers and my order has always been perfect! This location also has a bar with lots of local and imported beer, which is a plus! :-)"}
{"text":"While staying in Madison to teach a workshop I ordered from Glass Nickel and had pizza delivered to my hotel room.  The service was great, easy to order and delivered on time.  The pizza was delicious! I had a very thin crust pizza with sausage and pepperoni.  The red sauce was rich and flavorful and the meats were tasty, spicy and plentiful!  YUM!"}
{"text":"My wife and I lived in Chicago for several years, so I have to give the Pizza 4 stars, however, Glass Nickel is the best pizza in the area and the service is 5 stars.  The pizza is always hot, the people on the phone and the delivery men are always very polite, and they rarely exceed 45 minutes to deliver.  Glass Nickel will always be our first stop for our pizza needs."}
{"text":"Great staff, we go all the time.  Pizza is always good. We don't order online because it's to hard to judge wait time.  Glass nickel does cost more than the chains because its a quality pizza/sandwich/salad"}
{"text":"We have Glass Nickel deliver often. I like that they have the option to order online although lately that hasn't been working properly and it always says \"This Location is closed\" or \"This location does not deliver to your address\". Both are false because we call and have no issues. We usually get pizza and wings. The pizza is pretty good and they have some different specialty pizzas that are worth trying. Their wings are what we really enjoy. They are nice and crispy and come with different sauce options on the side. The nickel nuggets are good but I was disappointed in their cheese curds.   I can't speak for dining in at this location because I've only ever eaten inside the Atwood Ave location but we have been satisfied with the food and prompt delivery. It can get pricey but be sure to look for coupons- they always have some available."}
{"text":"Unacceptably long wait for our pizza. We ordered 16\" and they brought out 14\", which we didn't notice til end of meal when we still felt hungry. The pizza was brought to the table lukewarm, and the ingredients (mushroom & garlic) were so skimpy we could barely tell they were there. The salad was good and fresh, hence two stars instead of one. I am aghast at the number of high reviews. We definitely won't return."}
{"text":"This is a totally fine pizza place and I would return. Good value, and edible. Nice service. Nothing special, but not everything needs to be exceptional. Full bar is limited but nice."}
{"text":"One of the best take-out and value for the dollar pizzas in Madison.   I was about to write a positive review of another Glass Nickel, and I realized by reading the reviews that they must not all be the same quality or service.   I haven't been to the other locations but this branch has been great for years. I've come here to eat but mostly have ordered when we don't feel like cooking.   Their famous Fetalicious pizza is our go-to. It has lots of veggies but doesn't taste like bad veggie pizza for those of you who don't like veggie pizza.   The crust is great for non-Italian pizza. It's chewy and not too bready like most chains."}
{"text":"We were in Sun Prairie for a wedding and stopped at Glass Nickel to grab a bite to eat after the ceremony.  The restaurant itself was underwhelming (service wasn't particularly friendly right off the bat), but it was clean and featured ample seating and copies of The Onion.  We ordered two sandwiches and attempted to order the pub chips, but were informed that they were \"out of those.\"  Really?  It was 2 pm on a Saturday and the only other customers were an elderly quartet who had ordered a pizza.  Whatever.  The sandwiches were ok, nothing special.  I was intrigued by the specialty pizza menu and was thisclose to asking if they could deliver the Couch Potato (pizza topped with broccoli, cheese, bacon, and french fries...served with sour cream on the side for dipping) to our hotel room around 1 am.  I regretfully refrained.  All in all, food was acceptable, service left something to be desired.  And we could have used the Couch Potato following the reception.  Especially considering that we tried to look up \"Grilled Cheese\" in the phone book when we got back to our hotel room.  Next time..."}
{"text":"In town visiting friends & family and we ordered pizza from Glass Nickel one night.  Ordering online was easy and convenient.  We had the feta pizza and couch potato. Very tasty for a local area pizza place.  I'll admit I'm a little spoiled living in the same city as Tom Douglas's Serious pie."}
{"text":"Once upon a time in Madison there were a lot of pizza places.  They all sucked.  Then along came Glass Nickel, they had higher quality 'za with much more variety in toppings.  Yay!  Then after a while they started to suck a bit.  The pizza was always raw.  Always uncooked and white.  Ask for it well done?  75% chance it was raw anyway.  Dough became much more soft and underdone, doughy and rubbery.  Toppings taste cheap.  Salads, gross.  Fried mushrooms, mushy and raw.  It really seems like corners have been cut in the last few years both in quality of ingredients and in the staff.   There are now considerably better options available (Roman Candle, Ians to name a couple).  So I'm avoiding GN despite having been a fan for years."}
{"text":"A decent spot for takeout pizza. Called in an order and it was ready in about 15 minutes. A little bit of a medium thickness crust as a result of it being hand tossed. I liked the Mediterranean, which had lots of good flavors. Was not as big of a fan of the chicken parmesan, a little salty."}
{"text":"We have been coming here since 2014 and we have not had one bad pizza (except for.m the occasional glitch) but this is by far the best pizza and the best cheese that i have ever had i highly recommend this to be your pizza joint."}
{"text":"I appreciate this Wisconsin-based pizza chain.   Glass Nickel is definitely an upgrade from the likes of Pizza Hut, Domino's, and even Papa John's. As such, the pizzas are also more expensive. I'd call it semi-gourmet fast-food pizza. Their menu is relatively large. I like the spinach cheese bread here and their specialty pizzas aren't bad.   I'd recommend ordering online as Glass Nickel always has coupons to print and coupon codes. You won't necessarily save much, but take what you can get, right?"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite pizza joint in the area. The food is always fresh and unbelievably delicious, the atmosphere is extremely welcoming and a bit geeky and punny, and the staff will treat you like family every time!  If you are a serious pizza person, you will be treated to the best in pan baked perfection!  Be sure to ask about the flavor of the month!    I most recently had a classic Pepperoni pizza for the table and the largest small \"Bac-n-Bleu\" salad I have ever seen.  The food is delicious, the people are fantastic, and the general vibe is fun and funky.  A must go when in the area for sure!"}
{"text":"Being that I travel a lot it's difficult to find great food period....but to find great food AND they deliver quick is great! Delicious food! I definitely will be ordering again when I come back to Wisconsin....."}
{"text":"This is one of Madison's best pizza places! If you're looking for a budget or diet friendly place, this is NOT the place. It's slightly expensive for pizza but definitely worth the splurge. They do have salad options that are delicious but I wouldn't call them low calorie. The Calzone with sausage and mushroom is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Oh, Glass Nickel. How I miss you. Ordinarily, I'm all over Glass Nickel -- they're fast, prompt, the food is good, great toppings, great variety, the works. When I realized I couldn't eat gluten, I was super excited to see that Glass Nickel offered a gluten-free crust option.  Strike #1: The gluten-free crust only comes in 10\". Still, it's a specialty item, so I can understand. Strike #2: It costs $3 extra to get said 10\" crust. Okay, well, I guess they don't sell many of them... Strike #3: The taste and the texture. Grainy, chewy in a not-good way, cardboard, soggy, flavorless. Too thin to support the pizza, even by pizza-with-lots-of-things standards. The edges were rock solid, like cardboard, and overall it was... severely, severely disappointing. SEVERELY disappointing.  I completely understand the challenges and issues with a gluten-free crust--I'm an avid baker and a science geek--but given that they offer a cracker crust, I see no reason why a popular restaurant can't find a good flatbread recipe and use that.   3 stars, but only because their regular stuff is great. Truly disappointing from a gluten-free standpoint."}
{"text":"Dropped into Glass Nickel later in the evening on a recent trip to Madison on the advice of our local friend and tour guide. The place smelled wonderful and I was salivating immediately at the realization that the only thing I'd eaten since breakfast was two fried cheese curds pilfered from my friend's lunch.  We ordered a house specialty Fetalicious pie as well as the current special Gyro pie. I tacked on a Caesar salad as my body was screaming for something green-ish. A pitcher of Bell's Oberon completed the meal.  The food arrived quickly and the pies were fantastic. Anyone who's a fan of feta cheese will eagerly inhale the Fetalicious pie and violently box out anyone else who might go for the last piece. I thought the Gyro pie would be too over-the-top, but the sparingly-added chunks of gyro meat and tzatziki on the side provided the needed balance to make this a somewhat unexpected winner.  One last note which doesn't in any way diminish my review of Glass Nickel: We decided to attend the second of the improv shows taking place down the basement and quickly regretted our decision. I admired the spirit of the two 'actor/comedians' who were up on stage, but they were simply awful and I hurt for them as they struggled on-stage. What's worse, a couple of obvious friends of the performers laughed at an artificially-enhanced volume to make up for the otherwise quiet room. Unfortunately, the only easy way to escape the 'club' is to actually cross the stage (during the 2-3 second periods of lights-out prompts for applause, apparently) which kept us captive far longer than we had hoped. Brutal. I'm sure other shows are better, but it may be best to inquire about who's performing in advance."}
{"text":"The BEST in Madison! I like to stick with the peperoni and sausage but when I'm looking for a different taste I like the spinach feta pizza with sausage. Good delivery speeds too! I've also enjoyed the chicken cordon pizza and sub. :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza as usual! Usually get delivery at work but ordered for pick up and it was ready as promised. My out of town guests loved it!"}
{"text":"New to the area and use the online ordering system for delivery 2-3 times per month. Always receive our order very fast (within the hour after order).  Delivery agents are always pleasant and don't seem to be bothered by having to park, get in an elevator and walk our order to our door.  We order pretty generic - sausage, pepperoni & mushroom pizzas but their menu has many options available with a unique pizza each month.  We have never been dissatisfied with their pizza.  The meatball & italian subs are very good as well.  Ordered a spaghetti dinner once and it was just okay.  The side salad was standard as well - but I didn't expect anything more than what I received.   We will continue to order because the service is excellent and the pizzas/subs are good for the price."}
{"text":"This is a hip restaurant that you can come on in, grab a menu, and seat yourself. The wait staff is very friendly and personable.  We tried the Toasted Spinach Artichoke Ravioli and they were really good, I would definitely recommend them for an appetizer.  For dinner we selected one of the many speciality pizzas and was really impressed on how good it was. The crust was perfect and made just the way we like it.  They also have other selections of food to choose from if your not in the mood for pizza. We will definitely come back when we are in town!"}
{"text":"Sorry but this is overpriced and doesn't taste very well. Toppers down the street is so much better. The proportions were small, too."}
{"text":"Have had their pizza delivered many times and they're always good. Salads are fresh and very good too. Saturday night we ate at their restaurant. Really like the booths. The pizza was great, crust perfect loaded with toppings. The waitress was really nice and attentive. The place is clean and music not too loud. We both had a tap beer and it was perfect temp. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This pizza absolutely MAKES my Friday night every time I order it. The cheese is always perfect, nicely browned and caramelized. I order just cheese (I know I know not too adventurous) so I look for the details in my pizza. Glass Nickel knows just how to get the details right. Nice, fluffy/bready dough. Spicey (not hot spicy but not bland) sauce. I just had this overwhelming feeling of contentment the last time I dug in on Pizza Friday. Maybe only I get emotional about pizza, but this is a great pizza to get emotional over."}
{"text":"I am pretty open-minded about pizza. I prefer it with a pretty thick crust and no meat but will try it no matter what is on it. This weekend I was without a vehicle (but with my three kids) and not in the mood to make any more PBJs. I wanted somebody to bring me some food, but I was also not in the mood for pizza.   I settled on Glass Nickel because their pizza is good and I'd get some nice pasta out of it (the salads sounded good, too, but I wanted some warm food). I was able to do my order online, which I LOVE (two reasons: I am antisocial, and there should be less chance of getting it wrong since I wasn't relying on somebody to listen closely and write down what I said). I was able to put the tip on my credit card, another good thing.   One thing I wasn't aware of was the email updates. I got an email once the order was finalized and sent, then another one when it was being prepared and then a third when it was out for delivery. It was a cold Saturday night, but delivery was pretty darn fast. The delivery driver was your stereotypical friendly stoner, and he had his own pen! (I used to order delivery more often, and I was always surprised at how often the driver didn't have anything to write with).   The kids enjoyed their pepperoni pizza and I loved my pasta (fettucine noodles with pesto sauce, broccoli, and mushrooms. The broccoli was pretty well shredded, but it tasted very good)."}
{"text":"It is not just Pizzas here by any scale. We did order a Pizza and we ordered 5 other things. Their Pizza made to order was great. Tossed Cheese Ravioli was awesome, Mozzarella Cheese sticks were a good deal, their custom salad was super fresh and portions were fine. Shrimp and chips platter was good. In all a great experience over wine, lemonande and unlimited cups of tea. It is more like 4.5 for me."}
{"text":"Incredible pizza shop. The BOARIS KARLOFF is a fantastic pizza and I'd eat it everyday if it wouldn't cause me a myocardial infarction. I ate the glutenous style and the gluten-free type, both are wonderful. Employees were lovely and I even took a pic with one!"}
{"text":"Heck no. Never again.   While I like Glass Nickel in other locations, the Sun Prairie location is ridiculous. I cannot think of a better word for it. I don't even care if your pizza is decent, your customer service is the absolute worst.   I hesitated even writing a review about this (especially because it happened over a year ago), but after reading other people's similar experiences, I will. I attempted to order a pizza online so it would be ready to pick up on the way home after I grabbed my kids from daycare. I placed the order ahead of time and specified a time to pick it up. I received an email conformation saying they got the order. When I went to pick it up, the girl at the counter acted surprised when I said I was here to pick up an order, but didn't say anything unusual about it. She said it would be ready in a minute. Twenty minutes go by so I go up to ask about the pizza. (there were no other customers in the restaurant this entire time). Another girl at the counter snaps back at me, \"I don't know about your pizza. I'm not the one who took your order\" and walked away. So, the other girl responds, \"it'll just be a minute.\" Another twenty minutes go by until I ask again. The girl responds, \"which pizza did you order?\" Seriously? She walks back to check and says it'll a few more minutes. Here I am waiting 40 minutes after the time it was supposed to be ready with a 4-year-old and a 5-year-old hungry and tired of waiting. I patiently wait 5 more minutes before kindly asking for a refund. The girl glared at me and said she didn't think she could do that. I said I wasn't paying  for a pizza that I didn't get. The manager then walked up to the counter, didn't say a word, but gave me a refund. He then handed me the pizza saying, \"you can have it, anyway.\" I felt like it was wrong of me to be there ordering a pizza from them. They made me feel like a massive inconvenience.   Glass Nickel, please change your attitude toward your customers. We are forgiving people and can forget the past."}
{"text":"Pretty decent pizza. It's not going to blow your mind, but there are tons of different unusual options alongside the traditional fare.  Staff is also really nice.  The disappointing part for me was being that we are staying in a hotel and didn't want to eat on our beds we ate in.  It's all plastic utensils, paper plates, and no refills on soda.  I guess that's snobbery on my part, but I like a relaxing sit down pizza joint."}
{"text":"Yum. . . it took me a while to try their pizza (they don't deliver to my house!) and everyone kept telling us the Fetalicious was the best - and I can honestly say that it is. It was the first we tried and although we've tried a few other varieties - its the one we mostly order (plus sausage please). Very good and very worth the drive in our case."}
{"text":"Normally I don't eat pizza but I'll admit this was good. My fiancé literally left no pieces for tomorrow  nobody finishes a medium pizza on their own unless it's something special! Here's a place for firsts."}
{"text":"A solid 4 stars for the pizza and a 5 star rating for the bar. Glass nickel has a nice draft selection as well as one of my favorite bartenders, Hannah. She's a sweetie. I love coming here with my bestie because it is laid back yet a gorgeous polished wood bar to toss a few brews back and catch up on the latest gossip and news with my friends. Pizza margarita with extra garlic is my favorite. I once ordered a basket ofi shrimp and fries and was impressed with the shrimp because they were fairly large and good portion. I was expecting a few tiny shrimp. Owners are always accomadating and make you feel like royalty. That's another plus. Jen the other bartender is awesome too but I'm usually here on Tuesday or Wednesday when Hannah is pouring beer. Sun Prairie is lucky to have this place. Sure beats the bar food at the Gritty and way less douche bags here than the nitty gritty too"}
{"text":"Glass Nickel is my go-to when I'm in the mood for something a lil' bit classier than Pizza Hut, but don't feel like going out. First, I love their house crust. Cornmeal dusted and a little bit of chew. The meats, cheeses, and veggies they use are quality - and their appetizer menu is pretty extensive. What I REALLY like, is that the delivery people at this location are always very friendly and quick."}
{"text":"I had the Fetalicious, in gluten-free form.  Prior to discovering my gluten intolerance (around 5 years ago), I had enjoyed the Fetalicious.  So when a friend told me that GN had gluten-free pizza, I was excited.  I really hadn't had any take -out pizza in many years.   Being gluten-free, I didn't expect the crust to be stellar, and it was certainly not - very thin, dry, and tasteless.  I did expect the toppings to make up for that in abundance and flavor.  I wanted gooey, cheesy decadence.  But this pizza was the driest, saltiest, most tasteless thing I've ever eaten.  There was only the barest hint of tomato sauce, and mozzarella cheese was no where to be found.  A few small, sad-looking peices of tomato were scattered on the top of the pizza.  Perhaps I detected a mushroom or two.  There were some greens that I assume were spinach, but again, they tasted of nothing.  The only \"flavor\" present was that of salt.  The pizza was almost inedible.  And expensive, too.  I can DEFINITELY live gluten-free, without pizza, if this is what it's like.  Will NOT be ordering from GN ever again. I hope that the non-gluten-free pizzas are WAY better than this pizza.  If not, why exactly is this place still in business???"}
{"text":"I am trying to get over how much I miss this place since I moved. The food was awesome and I recommend the cheese curds because they are the best. The pizza is pretty great, not the best in the world, but pretty great. I liked the atmosphere and the servers were interesting. If I ever get back here, I will order those fried up cheese curds and marry them."}
{"text":"I'm not familiar with the actual restaurant. My review is based on delivery.  On a handful of occasions, I've had pizza from Glass Nickel when delivered to my work for lunch functions. Every time, I can't stop eating. I really can't.  The ingredients used by Glass Nickel truly taste as though they are real ingredients. Real veggies, real cheese. The dough also tastes homemade. I believe the pizzas are from scratch.  I'm not really a big pizza person -- probably because most of my pizza experiences are eating the chewy, icky, greasy Pizza Hut or other chain restaurant pizza. The Glass Nickel Pizza is a pleasant and wonderful alternative to the typical Americanized, cheap-ingredient pizza we are all unfortunately too accustomed to.  Yes, I would recommend this pizza to anyone! And in the meantime, I should really visit the restaurant ..."}
{"text":"After reading raving reviews of Glass Nickel Pizza, I have to say it was underwhelming.  I have honestly come to prefer Papa John's.  But then again, I don't eat meat so I wouldn't take this review TOO seriously.  I'm sure their other pizzas are good."}
{"text":"Feta-freaking-licious. Holy shit. That's all I can say."}
{"text":"5 stars for the bartenders when we sat their waiting for our order.   We had amigos conversations while we were waiting.     As for the rest of the experience it has been hit and miss.  The first couple times we ordered to go pizza it was great, the next two times the pizza seemed over cooked and our out of town guests were not too impressed.  Because we have had good experiences and it's by our house I went there again tonight, ordered the family special and got a pepperoni and a fetalicious pizza.  Both were cooked perfectly and while we waited I sat at the bar again and had same bartender as the last time.    Consistency seems to be an issue here and the last thing I would mention is that the people taking pizza orders always see stressed, I know they are busy but when I am the only one at the counter a smile and how's your day wouldn't be too difficult.    Because of their location and unique toppings we will continue to go there.."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! I recommend the Fetalicious. I've only ever done delivery so can't comment on the ambience or service of the place."}
{"text":"Glass Nickel is like an old, reliable friend who's hip, funny and easy on the eyes.  It's a comfy place with good food.  The pizza is quite good -- not the best I've ever had, but it's certainly up there.  Their default pizza has kind of a medium-thick crust, but you can get it thin and extra thin.  The specialty pizzas are pretty incredible.  My favorites are the ubiquitous Fetalicious and the Socre Bleu, but I've tried many of the others and have never been disappointed.  For the build-your-own option, they have a TON of toppings to choose from.  It's also worth mentioning that their regular red pizza sauce is vegan, which makes it easy to build a vegan pizza if you so desire.  Glass Nickel also offers a ton of other non-pizza foods.  My second favorite (after the pizza) would have to be the subs, which are very good but not huge.  Still, half of one is a good meal when I'm not totally starving.  The subs have as many ingredient options as the pizza, making them very versatile.  You can get them hot, cold, toasted or anything in between, really.  There are also salads with similarly huge lists of toppings and different greens to built from.  In addition, there are pastas (passable but not great), some very good appetizers (try the spinach cheese bread!) and some other things (like chicken strips and fish fry) that I haven't tried.  They have some good beers on tap, of course.  The prices are reasonable -- not really \"cheap,\" but still decent for non-special-occasion dining out.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is quite fun, with lots of dark wood and plenty of booths.  I have found it a bit dark in there, but my eyes eventually adjust.  The waitstaff is super friendly.  They play a variety of good music (I've heard everything from Hank Williams to Morrissey).  And they're open really late!  I usually take advantage of that last fact via delivery, which is always friendly and usually takes precisely the quoted 45-60 minutes.  I usually order with their online ordering service, which is really easy to use and great if you don't like talking on the phone that much.  Overall, I would call Glass Nickel one of my favorite restaurants in Madison.  It's an easy choice when you want to eat out but can't make up your mind, because it's a friendly and welcoming place with an absolutely huge menu that's sure to please everyone somehow."}
{"text":"Gaaaahhh!! I can't even begin to tell you how much I love glass nickel pizza. So much so, I had shitty pizza today, and all I could think while eating it was \"could've had glass nickel\". Still regretting it. Best delivery, great staff, excellent food. GNP, I love you."}
{"text":"As far as I can tell, Glass Nickel has the best delivery-pizza in town. Not the cheapest, but it's worth it if you're at all picky, so it's my default option when it's late and there's no food in the fridge. And they've got plenty of options for customizing the pizza, so it's hard not to find something good. I've got no idea about their non-pizza items though."}
{"text":"I can't believe I need to write this review! I love GL. I just think the prices are high and if you're ordering delivery?? Forget it. With delivery and tip you're adding a good $6-$10+.  If you can, go pick it up. You'll have saved enough for some really good ice cream or another fancy dessert"}
{"text":"Food is delicious and consistently ready on time. Solid local food place. The calzones, pizza and sandwiches are all quality. Long time customer and will stay that way for the foreseeable future."}
{"text":"Great food, when it finally shows up. I love the Glass Nickle on Atwood and gave this location 5 chances but they did not deliver. Mostly literally. The food was up to par but food was ready at least 45 minutes later than they told me all but one time. If they could consistently deliver on time they would be great but they cannot. If you are willing to wait 2 hours for delivery or an hour and a half for takeout order from here. But know you will probably have given up and eaten your shoe leather before food arrives."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza in Madison. I often had to order six or more pies for work functions, and this was my place to make people pleased. They cook great food, use good ingredients, and deliver on time. Happy to work with them."}
{"text":"The Chicken Cordon Bleu pizza is one of the best pizzas I've had. The Hot Wing Hoagie is amazing too. I have never been disappointed here. There is also a very fun comedy club in the basement!"}
{"text":"I don't know what the hype is about - I tried the Fetalicious pizza, and while it was *good* and I *enjoy feta cheese very much* I did not have dreams of  nor cravings for this pizza. Perhaps if I'd had it with thin crust instead..."}
{"text":"First of all, I love the designs on the counters  made out of nickles.  Being from Massachusetts, I came out to visit friends and I was told I had to try cheese curds.. I was told they were squeaky cast offs in the cheese making process.  I was hesitate but when in Rome... So we went to Glass Nickel Pizza Co and ordered the fried cheese curds.  If you are going to try something you are unsure of, why not deep fry it?  All I can say is, these are amazing. No one mentioned that cheese curds, even cheddar ones, have the consistency of string cheese/mozzarella. So deep fried, it's like little bites of mozzarella stick heaven. Greasy and delicious.  But if you are looking at this, you are probably from WI and know all about cheese curds, so I digress. I also got the Santa Fe sandwich (hold the jalapeno's). Chicken smothered in cheese and bbq sauce with peppers and onions. It's a greasy sub/pizza joint. It's pretty much what you expect, but it's inexpensive and the portions are enough for two people.  That's A-OK in my book."}
{"text":"Meh.  On par with Dominos.  We ordered the hand tossed pizza with classic sauce and breadsticks for delivery.  Blah.    Pizza was cold and taste was nothing special.  Time to step up your game.  This was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza delivery in Madison. I love that I can order online and get text message updates about when my pizza is being prepared and then out for delivery. They have quite a few vegetarian options, good salads, and even deliver frozen custard!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and have always had a good meal.  I typically get the calzone and have always enjoyed it. Their pizzas are better then any chain and come in some uniquely delicious flavors. The staff is the perfect blend of attentive, but not over bearing."}
{"text":"I have heard a lot of people knock this place but I don't know why. The pizza is excellent, the toppings are of very good quality and the cheese is outstanding. Try their green olives on a pizza, not something I would order anywhere else but from here it is delicious. The fried mac n' cheese sounds nasty but its surprisingly good. Best pizza in Madison."}
{"text":"Glass Nickle isn't just for pizza.  Try the carryout salads.  Start with any of the listed salads and then customize to your hearts content.  Chef salads are a great place to start.  My son orders the caesar salad adds chicken and is set. The toppings are fresh & plentiful.  Add in your one (or more) of the 15 choices of dressings, croutons, normal or extra amounts, fork or no fork.  Your dinner is sent and is cold, crisp and ready to eat.   If you order the large expect to eat it for 2 meals."}
{"text":"The place I miss the most in Madison. I live in New York now and I'm desperately finding a fm good pizza place like this. Their combo pizza was on point. Always ordered delivery so not sure how clean the venue is. Their pizza crust was okay for me, but if you like it thin, oh well..."}
{"text":"Stopped in over the weekend for the first time in a long time. The food was fine, but I'm pretty sure the staff was stoned. The host couldn't keep track of the wait list, even though there were only 3 parties waiting for a table, and our waitress, though very friendly, was oddly flighty. I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"The food is good but they can screw a up a delivery in the most amazing ways.  Ranging from completely forgotten items to delivering a chicken strip sandwich with no chicken strips on it?  You would figure ordering online and pre tipping would at-least smooth these issues out, they don't.  The good food is overshadowed by complete incompetence."}
{"text":"This review is about the food, not about the place and not about the service. First of all, if you order from them, PLEASE make sure to try their Chicken Alfredo pizza as well as Chicken Cordon Bleu pizza. I have constantly ordered pizza from them for the past 3 years, and I ordered nothing but those two. It never disappoint me, it's so yummyyy. I could never find pizza at any other place that is even close to how Glass Nickel has it :(  Oh, and their chicken wings are pretty good too."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times over the years and have always been satisfied with my visit.  The wait time is around 10 minutes each time I have went (dinner), which is not too bad.  Inside is a great atmosphere for hanging out and enjoying a beer with friends.  They have a decent selection of beer, and a great menu to choose from.  Their specialty pizzas are excellent, and I would recommend the santa fe (bbq chicken pizza).    If you live in the area, they often have coupons in the mail for 2 14\" pizzas (1-topping and a specialty) & a 2 liter of soda for $25 bucks.  That definitely is a good deal to split between 4 friends."}
{"text":"I am so happy to have visited Glass Nickel's physical location in Sun Prairie instead of just ordering out! So thrilled to have found a good local bar that also serves food. They stay open late, but there were not many restaurant guests when we came in and just a few other people at the bar -- super refreshing in contrast to overly-crowded and noisy Barr House across the street.   The atmosphere is really chill and the bartender was cool, so this felt like a really comfortable and fun place just to hang out for a late-night drink.  I'm a big fan; this might be our new go-to Sun Prairie bar."}
{"text":"Glass Nickel is a very recent discovery to me. Up until about 2 months ago, I had lived in Milwaukee and hadn't had the opportunity to sample Glass Nickel. They had a store front in Milwaukee for about 6 months, but it didn't last. I made the incorrect assumption they didn't have a good product, but in reality, Milwaukee just has way too many established pizza joints in the area where they were located, it was doomed!  Thankfully, I didn't let this blip on the Milwaukee radar stop me from trying Glass Nickel when I moved to Madison. We live within walking distance to this particular location and we frequent it at least twice a month.  My personal favorite pizza is the Couch Potato (sans bacon). I also just tried their special pizza of the month for October (a portabella pizza) and it was spectacular! Along with the outstanding pizza options, their garlic bread sticks are hella cheap, and pretty much equate to a medium pizza. I'd like to say I've overindulged a time or two when I had a little too much to drink, but then I'd be lying to myself cause usually I'm straight up sober and their pizza is just that tasty.   Not only is it a solid pizza choice, they are always super fast! Yesterday, I called at 2 before the packer game for a pizza and sticks, and it was done within half an hour. That's pretty outstanding!   Glass Nickel definitely fulfills all my pizza needs!"}
{"text":"Cardiac Arrest pizza is amazing. Solid selection of craft beers and service always seems to be good. Have really only stuck to the pizza and apps but would try a sandwich."}
{"text":"Five days before an event, I ordered 15 of their specialty pizzas to be delivered to a party at a set time. They arrived right on time. It was fun to have the chance to order so many different versions. Clearly I didn't have the opportunity to try all of them, so this review is about the ease of ordering and delivery reliability."}
{"text":"We came in to Madison for a family event and after all the flying, driving, and glasses of wine needed pizza so badly. The pizza was so great and we are now enjoying lunch the next day... Sacre bleu and fetalicious really was super: not greasy pizza, flavors of the fresh vegetables still in evidence, and just delicious."}
{"text":"Used to be a FIVE STAR place. These days, we can't seem to get the right order half the time (last time we ordered a pasta dish we received a container of hot sauce...no pasta) or even order at all. Online ordering has been hosed for a couple months now. You get all the way thru your order to have your card declined. Call it in with no problem.  Several phone calls and online convos later...it's still not fixed.  Bummer...used to be the BEST place (for several YEARS) for deliver on the SW side of Madison."}
{"text":"Quite frankly, I don't get the hype. None of the crusts are particularly good--the guys making them have no idea what they're doing. Crusts shouldn't be semi-soft (even if it's regular), and the thin crust is simply mediocre.   And then there are the specialty ones. If you want something that's really vomit-inducing, go for the tailgate pizza. This is simply mediocre pizza at best--cheese and pepperoni can really only be compared to Dominos.  I'm a \"Coastie\" (I hate that term...), and we take pizza pretty seriously back East--I would also like to note that the pile of dough and glop you get in Chicago is not pizza. Justice Scalia certainly agrees with me on that note. Glass Nickel, though? Sigh. Sigh. Sigh."}
{"text":"Average pizza with not-so-good crust (sort of a blander Domino's) but great cheese and fresh toppings due to high turnover.   They deliver all day long every day starting early, including Sundays, and the pizzas arrive in under 45 minutes. They're the only company in town that seems to understand that fast and reliable delivery means return business.   Prices are 'fine', you're not going to be impressed but you also won't be annoyed after paying like with Roman Candle or Ian's.   If you're wiling to go out for pizza there are about a half dozen places that are much better, but for affordable pajama pizza delivery any time of day Glass Nickel has cornered the Madison market."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in town.  Nice chewy crust. Unique or normal toppings. Classic pizza place atmosphere.  Try the pizza of the month. It's always good."}
{"text":"Great pizzas!:  Sacre Bleu: creative, unique, and complex Bacon Cheeseburger: Rich, heavy, filling, and a safe bet for a group of meat eaters The Phoenix: Amazing  The Big Eddy: Hello!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, many great options and great service at all locations. I have had this pizza many times and have never been disappointed. I have had delivery and have eaten in the restaurant. Their vegan options are amazing and super tasty. I got the spicy Thai vegan pizza, which was topped with tofu and vegan cheese. It arrived on time and with a friendly delivery staff. I will continue to order delivery and eat in the restaurant. Friendly staff and great food is the best."}
{"text":"This is on par with most of Madison pizza- which is to say- meh.  Not bad, not good....just pizza.  I'm not sure what it is with Madison delivery or maybe it's where we live, but we've received mostly cold pizza from a lot of places.  Isn't there a better way to transport?!  It's the worst when you take a bite and the whole cheese/toppings come off because it's cold and glued together.  Anyway, not bad in a pinch but would not recommend it with any enthusiasm."}
{"text":"This place was recommended from the staff at the Cambria Suites.  They delivered which was a plus for us coming in so late and being tired from driving all day.  They couldn't really explain or give us a comparison to what their regular thin crust meant.  One was cracker thin and the other just thin, whatever that means.  So we got hand tossed and I didn't really care for it but the house cheese blend was good as were the toppings, sausage-pepperoni-Canadian bacon.  We also ordered the spinach cheese bread but all we got was cheese bread.  I guess we should have had them repeat the order on the phone.  The cheese bread was good though.  The marinara sauce that came with the cheese bread was really good.  Overall the food was good even if the service was a little frustrating."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy pizza.  Crust is mid range between thin and a thick crust.  Tastes homemade.  My favorites are their deluxe (what can I say, I like classics!) and the Ranch (bacon, chicken, red onions, tomato, ranch sauce).  The latter is simply to die for.  Their regular tomato sauce, which I think is what can make or break a pizza (in addition to the crust) is fantastic.  I will say though, that people seem to LOVE the fetalicious but I think it's gross. Obviously a personal preference.  And this review is for pizza from all Glass Nickel Pizza locations (including Atwood Ave, University Ave, Fitchburg, and Green Bay).  They are all very consistent."}
{"text":"If I'm going to wait an hour to get my pizza, can I at least get the right one? Apparently a deluxe without mushrooms means I want a Chicken Alfredo pizza, and I'm not waiting 2 hours for another one. 3 stars for good Mozzarella sticks though."}
{"text":"I remember glass nickel from when I lived in Madison almost 20 years ago. A few years back. I was in town for a beer festival and ordered to a local hotel possibly the most delicious concoction Ive ever had in my life. Today, after several beers, my boyfriend and I  decided to order a few calzones to take home - my god these people are PATIENT!!! Having a spent some time in service, I knew we were being annoying (but were unable to stop, sorry!) and these guys handled It like pros! Snaps again to Glass Nickel!"}
{"text":"Awesome. I love their online order form and their pizza is the best!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. The pizza I ordered was over cooked and lukewarm upon arrival which took over an hour to be delivered. The pizza was so tough you had to rip it away from your mouth to tear it off and chew it. It was Bad enough to have to throw it out. Probably would have been good if the crust was not so horrible. What a waste of $30. Will not order again from here."}
{"text":"Walked here to pick up pizza after a big snowstorm. Didn't know what to expect, as it was the only option really accessible for us. For being a chain pizza place, it was great. The sauce and cheese were very good, and the price was decent for such a large pizza.  Girlfriend ordered the gluten-free pizza, which she described as also being very tasty.   Tip: If you order online, there are a number of coupons. Even if none of them apply to you, there is a $2 off coupon which anyone can use."}
{"text":"This place ain't a continual Madison Favorite for no reason.  The pizza is swoon inducingly good.  My default favorite is the Fetalicious (because, let's face it, I would just eat buckets of feta morning, noon and night, if it wouldn't kill me).  I've tried multiple others, which have been noteworthy (Margherita, Cheesasaurus, Vegg Out, Bacon Cheeseburger, and Mediterranean), and one that was not-so-noteworthy (the Thai Pie).  Just this weekend, though, I tried their Deluxe.  Oh, my.  I think we might have a contender for New Favorite Pizza.  So very, very delicious.  I've had their Mediterranean Lasagna--delicious.  Fish Fry?  Surprisingly awesome!  Chicken?  Also good.   Problem?  Their subs.  Ick.  Do yourself a favor and get a sub from...well, just about anywhere else.  Delivery almost always takes at least an hour, so, if you're nearby and hungry, just pick it up.  Pick up times are usually 15-20 minutes.  The Atwood Ave. location is really great to visit and dine in.  The other locations, not so much."}
{"text":"you know it's funny.  I heard people talk up this place a lot and so when I finally did order a pizza from here I was sure looking forward to something amazing.   But it was just regular ol' pizza.  Nothing spectacular at all. I have a theory.  It goes like this.  There are a lot of people in Wisconsin that have never tasted really good food.  They grew up on pancake mix with Shurfine pancake syrup, margarine, Folger's coffee and/or Sanka, instant potatoes, powdered milk, canned mixed vegetables, Campbell's soup, Kraft mac and cheese, Salisbury steak, wonder bread, Pillsbury muffins, Oscar Mayer hot dogs, and Swanson TV dinners.  So when pizza started showing up on the scene they had never tasted anything like it and were suddenly drawn to it's Italian sausage, crispy dough and oven baked aromas and flavors.   So now when they see anything that looks like a pizza they think it is good.  If it is round, covered in oil and comes out of an oven they leap on it without even thinking about what they are putting in their mouth.    I recently witnessed some friends who bought a pizza from this GREAT AMAZING PIZZA PLACE that when it arrived the entire topping slid off to one side of the crust into a pile of oil and mass of cheese.  They pushed it back into place and then ate it while exclaiming how good the pizza was.  I sort of slunk back and groaned. So when pizza places actually make pizzas that keep the food in place and don't burn the crust.... well, we actually have something positive happening and give them more kudos. I am willing to bet that Glass Nickel is popular because they are surrounded by so much mediocrity. I will try them again sometime and if my experience is better I will update my review. Glass Nickel is in support of the protests.  I step them up one star along with everyone else I have reviewed that are in support of the protest.  Thanks Glass Nickel!"}
{"text":"I usually order online ahead of time for pickup on the way to my daughters dance class. The food has always been ready when I got there (unless I got there earlier than planned). I LOVE their Hot Wing Hoagie sandwich and get it almost every time I go (minus the lettuce plus jalapenos and the sauce on the side!). Their fried mac & cheese and nickel nuggets are great too. It's been awhile since I've actually had pizza there, but the Cardiac Arrest pizza was good. The employees there are always very nice and they usually offer to carry my order out to my car!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza--moderately thick crust, just the way I like it, and a wide variety of toppings.  The signature pizzas are generally really good, but you can also build your own; after a long period of getting the Sacre Bleu, I started doing my own modified version with chicken instead of Canadian bacon.  They offer online ordering if, like me, you kind of hate talking to strangers on the phone.  Since I started using it, I've gotten some pretty nice email coupons.  They also used to offer like a 5% discount for paying cash; not sure if that's still in effect."}
{"text":"Unusual pizzas.  Not for those die hard people who want a traditional pizza pie.  We've tried several different kinds here, and all of them were AOK except for their new Lotta Enchilada.  It's Creamy Enchilada Sauce, House Blend Cheese, Chicken, Corn, Green Chiles and Fresh Cilantro.  Sounds interesting, but tastes like plain bread dough with paste slapped on it.  It was very, very bland, and when my dining companion called to complain to the manager, the only response he got was, \"yeah, it's not very good.  I don't know why we keep it on the menu.\"  WTF???    The service is mediocre, and the prices for the pies are way too expensive.    Don't go here unless you are purposely looking for an untraditional pizza, that sometimes can be a true abomination."}
{"text":"Glass Nickel advertises on the key to my hotel room. I ordered a pizza and received an email when my order was placed and when it went out for delivery.  It took 30 minutes from the time it left the restaurant until it arrived at my door cold.  Why advertise when you can't deliver a hot quality product.  Bad for business."}
{"text":"Listen, living in Boston, ya crave a good pie -- and believe it or not, there just isn't any! So being able to blast in to Glass Nickel (nice to see it's broadened its horizons beyond that first shop since I left) in the middle of the day and order a fresh pizza is amazeballs. Then, the crust is everything you hope for, and the fresh Mediterranean flavors are, in a word, delicious. Service with a smile and I'm all in. Thanks guys, that was great!!"}
{"text":"I'm a native Chicagoan so pizza has always been an integral part of my diet. We moved to Madison and immediately started a quest to find the best pizza. Glass Nickel was our first spot.  I must say, color me impressed. It's not the best pizza, I've ever had, but it was darn good and well balanced.  Glass Nickel does not take reservations so make sure that you plan accordingly. The restaurant is fairly small with a short bar. The servers are attentive and the atmosphere is fairly chill.  The beer list is diverse. I am quite happy when I see a beer list that has more than two beers on it that I really want to try. Some places will load their lists with IPAs, but not everyone likes to kill their taste buds with burnt hops, but hey, if you're into that the tap list here is diverse enough to allow you to do that. Of course, you have a great choice of malty beers too!  We ended up ordering some beers, Nickel Nuggets, and a 10 inch Fetalicious pizza with tossed crust.  Nickel Nuggets are bits of pizza dough that have been tossed into the fryer and have Parmesan cheese dumped on top. I LOVED the idea of this dish, but it was poorly executed. The bites were light and fluffy, but it was paired with the wrong sauce entirely. The dish is served with a heavy marinara. Since the bites are so light and the sauce is so thick, it's not really possible to dip, scoop, or otherwise apply sauce to them. I would much rather have seen a thin garlic butter. The marinara was completely useless.  For the main course we got the Fetalicious pizza per Yelp's recommendation. The pie is hand-tossed (you can request otherwise) and topped with tomato, onion, spinach, mushroom, and feta.   Glass Nickel has a well executed pizza with this special! You may think to yourself that dumping feta on a pizza is undesirable, but in this case it works very well. All of the elements of the pizza balance each other out. While the feta may be quite salty, the acid of the tomatoes balances it out well. This pizza is a prime example as to why you do not modify an order that a chef designs. Certain elements of a dish may be important to balance. Very well made pizza!"}
{"text":"We've ordered from here a number of times while I'm visiting Madison. Glass Nickel has consistently snappy delivery.  The \"Fetalicious\" is a really good pizza. As others have mentioned, the crust is where Glass Nickel kind of falls down. Overall though, I appreciate fast, tasty pizza, and that's what they deliver on."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Madison, without a doubt! Since they opened their doors on Atwood the pizza has been consistently great. A few hit and misses with service when dining in but in reality it comes down to the pizza!  \"Fetalicious\" has been voted the best pizza in Madison for years and the \"Cardiac Arrest\" is a nice antagonist to it's vegetarian brother... \"The Phoenix,\" which originated from the west side location, is a great pizza as well!  I've heard that the sandwiches, calzones, appetizers are okay. However, the pizza is where it's at!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! Smaller dining area compared to the Atwood location, and no beer... At least if I'm remembering my last visit correctly. However, great pizza and nice people. Good place to carry out!  The \"Phoenix\" is magical! Glad to see you guys back up and running!"}
{"text":"Glass Nickel was one of the better pizza places we have found in Madison. We got the cheese bread and margarita pizza, it was very simple but delicious! The thick crust was awesome and the cheese bread was great! We also stayed for the monkey business comedy show that was in the basement. It was awesome and nice to be able to have a whole night of entertainment for a reasonable price in one place. Our server was Jake the bartender. Had it been less busy, we think he would have been fantastic! It was a bit of slow service but it wasn't his fault, the area just seemed to be understaffed. For how busy it was, he did a great job and was hilarious in the show at the end."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't eaten Glass Nickel Pizza more...given that I used to live a block away.  I've only eaten in once, but gotten carryout numerous times.  Decent pizza(Fetalicious is the top choice), but nothing amazing. It just doesn't stand out to me. I'd chose Roman Candle over GN any day. Better pizza, and better atmosphere."}
{"text":"Build Your Own Pizza ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I should probably start off by saying that pizza is one of my absolute favorite foods. Ok, now that we got that out of the way.... So then it's clearly no surprise that I've been eating Glass Nickel Pizza for years. And it's always been good, BUT last night, ladies & gents, last night was a whole new level of deliciousness.  I branched out and built my own pizza in a whole new way. Feeling brave and adventurous and pretty darn hungry, I not only chose thin crust (which I know to be quite very good - tender yet crunchy with a great tear to it), but I also chose their Alfredo sauce which I'd never tried before and THAT made all the difference. It was perfect (and I don't use that word lightly) - not overly saucy, not too garlicky, not heavy in the least. It was perfect! I topped it with their house blend cheese, Italian sausage and tomatoes and I'm telling you, it was one of the best pizzas I've had in a long, LONG time.  So what am I trying to say?  Build your own, my friends - make the decision, be willing to try something you've never had before because you never know....... You just might end up having the best pizza ever."}
{"text":"For the love of all that is holy, fix your website. Online ordering is atrocious. Finding the menu is crazy-making. It is one of the most atrocious user experience I have ever encountered. Glass Nickel, who made the decision to buy and use this system? Fire them. It's 2016. How does your online experience suck this bad?"}
{"text":"The famous Fetalicious is here, and yes, I'm a fan.  Fetalicious, which features feta, tomatoes, onion, spinach, and a few other things is what I usually add to a group pizza order.  Even people who are usually not fans of pizza beyond the regular standards usually like Fetalicious.  In addition, Glass Nickel has a spicy tomato sauce that featured in the Border to Border pizza (pineapple, jalapeños are the main ingredients) that is a great addition.  My favorite non-pizza item is the spinach cheese bread.  Overall, GNP is one of my top choices for delivery.  Delivery and pickup is always quite timely and they have good hours. If you sign up for their mailing list, they have good opportunities to get limited time discounts or find days in which 10% of pizza sales go to a selected charity."}
{"text":"I love Glass Nickel! Not only is their food delicious, I've ordered from them dozens of times and the quality is extremely consistent and they have never made even a small mistake on an order. I have a gluten allergy and their gf crust is delicious, and I feel safe that they take food allergies seriously and take care to prevent cross contamination.   My favorite order: The Ranch pizza (bacon, chicken, ranch, cheddar cheese...nothing italian about it but it's amazing) and the Acropolis Salad, which is overflowing with yummy olives and feta cheese.   Also: My workplace occasionally will place large orders (like 10 pizzas) for meetings, and they have always been delivered within 40 min of ordering. (We are located very close by so delivery itself is of course quick, but it's amazing they made the pizzas so fast.) Bravo Glass Nickel!"}
{"text":"Glass Nickel definitely has some of the best pizzas in town. Unfortunately, they're just way too over priced for me. I don't really understand the cult following. If you want expensive pizza, go to Uno's and get the nicer dinning experience. Otherwise go some place that's priced normally and still quality (it's not hard to find in Madison).  Also, quick note, I tried their po-boys during Mardi Gras season and they aren't too bad. They're definitely not as delicious as The Bayou's, but they're way cheaper. They're good for when you're really craving a po-boy, but don't want to make your own or pay for better."}
{"text":"My roommate from last year (who is also from the Chicagoland area) refused to let us order anything from Madison for pizza delivery unless it was Glass Nickel because it was the closest he could get to the pizza back home. He's kind of an elitist pizza snob, but whatevs, I love him dearly even if he's a little bit off on this one.  I've had a few of their specialty pizzas (Couch Potato, Cardiac Arrest, and Cheesasaurus) and meh. I've not been terribly impressed. Certainly, the ingredients and preparation is higher quality than, say, Ian's or Pizza di Roma, but it's not one of those pizza places I order from a lot because: A. it's a little more expensive than I'm willing to spend, and B. it's super dough-heavy.  I don't mind a lot of dough, but I feel like it overcompensates a bit in terms of taste. There's more dough in the flavoring rather than the actual ingredients.  I'd consider giving this place four stars, but as my delivery guy today was nearly a half hour over the expected time frame? Eh, I can't really justify more than 3. Besides, I'm not really that crazy over this place anyways. It's one of those places that if your friends want to go to--fine, but it's not one I'd take on my own initiative except for every once and awhile."}
{"text":"Bought two calzones today. Carry-out. Both were lukewarm and upon beginning to eat at home, realized they were not cooked all the way. Dough inside. We tried to put them in our oven to cook them through. They were in there at least 25 minutes and we ended up throwing them away. What a waste of $20."}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious and I order it when I am in town. However, I ordered a spinach salad with the pizza and I received a box of spinach with salad dressing. That's not a salad, it's a box of spinach. Not much to eat or enjoy. Fairly disappointed."}
{"text":"My family started eating at Glass Nickel in the 90s and it eventually became a sort of tradition. One day about a month ago we were planning for someone's birthday dinner and of course, we should go to Glass Nickel. After a pause, my uncle asked the group, \"you know, I don't see why we keep going there. Why don't we go somewhere else?\" After some brief confusion, everybody expressed their personal opinion that it is not very good, as though their previously great product created enough early momentum in the eyes of Madisonians to stay in our restaurant rotation.  The crust is best described as limp and flavorless (unless you count greasy as a flavor), the sauce has so much sugar you might get diabetes, and the amount of toppings you get vary widely with each pie. Tasty cheese though.  Glass Nickel occupies a place one notch above Dominos and Pizza Hut, but with all the fantastic pizzerias in town like Brutta, why would you go here? It's a poor man's Salvatore's."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken wings (small) & a Garden salad, took them over an hr & 10 minutes to deliver. Then when the delivery guy carelessly handed me the food, it almost fell to the floor & he expected a tip. The food was ok, not worth the wait. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"My boss ordered Glass Nickel for an all-staff lunch meeting. The pizza arrived 15 minutes late and barely warm. In addition, all of the pizzas had not been cut properly so people standing in line had to fight to tear off a slice. Then, to add insult to injury, the crust of all the pizzas was so tough it was difficult to tear off a bite. Shame on you, Glass Nickel.  Used to be the best pizza ever, now it's just expensive crappy or inconsistently OK pizza."}
{"text":"Absolute garbage. I've been eating here for years but after tonight I won't be returning. I ordered a pizza, a pasta dish and an appetizer and even though I spent 6 minutes repeating and ensuring my order was correct, when I received the order the appetizer was missing, a pasta topping was nowhere to be found and the side salad that came with it had rotten lettuce. On top of that, the pasta itself was so overcooked it was beyond mushy and the portion size I've always gotten from Glass Nickel was cut in half. The only positive part of this experience was the delivery driver who was quick, courteous and professional. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Glass Nickel is a great value.  I came back to the hotel after class ended  for lunch.  I had decided to take it easy before exploring near-by.   So looking through the restaurant options that provided delivery to the hotel, the menu of Glass Nickel jumped out at me.  I decided to have Nickel Nuggets (basically bites of bread with marina sauce) and 'home-made' meat lasagna.  The lasagna came with a side salad.  All this for $12.40, cool.   When the food arrived, I was very surprised.  It was a lot (could have possible feed at least 3-4) of food.  I was expecting about 10 Nickel Nuggets; there were too many to count.  Honestly, the handful I had didn't seem to make a dent (I guess they could be multiplying in the box, but I don't think so.)  The lasagna was delicious, it lived up to the expectation that 'home-made' had given me.     This is a great place to have in a college town.  Cheap, good food that lasts for two or three meals (even if you don't get the Nickel Nuggets).  Guess, I have a decision in front of me.  Do I eat more of it for dinner tonight, or do I go some new to feed the yelping need?  Stay tuned for the answer."}
{"text":"When you dine in, and order something that's typically served hot, well, you know, you expect it to be hot when it's set in front of you.  I ordered the beef ravioli with marinara.  Part of the entree was luke-warm.  The rest was cold.  The sauce was more than a little watery.  Why bother going back with food this mediocre?"}
{"text":"I had an online coupon for a $10 one-topping 16\" pizza. I went through their ordering menu, making two switches from the defaults - hot marinara instead of their classic sauce, and mozzarella cheese instead of their house blend. When I went to check out, I saw that the system was charging my substitutions as extra toppings. I clicked back to make sure these items weren't premium/\"double\" toppings and they weren't. I decided to call the store, as most places can solve issues with coupons, etc. over the phone.  I let the person who answered the phone know what was going on and they said it shouldn't be a problem to add the coupon from their end. When she entered my order, the same thing happened - it was charging me for extra toppings. She verified that these changes shouldn't incur an extra charge, and wondered if the issue came with it being a temporary coupon. I could hear her typing for a bit, then she said she can't alter the price in the system. She then asked if I was okay paying extra. I declined; yes, $13ish dollars is still a pretty good price for a large pizza, but the whole reason I was ordering was for the deal.   A similar situation had occurred with another location but without the use of a coupon; I tried to sub the same things in a calzone and when I called the store the woman said no problem. She didn't quote me a price and when the bill arrived I saw they had charged me extra for the substitutions. The couple of dollars wasn't worth calling back for, but that tells me it's not just for \"temporary coupons.\" I let the woman on the phone know, and she acknowledged but didn't offer to pass it on. She also didn't offer to get a manager to override the price. She was very nice and did try to solve the problem, but didn't take the next logical step (unless she was the manager, but then there should be some creative problem solving).   Am I being a total cheapskate? Yes. However, if it's happening to me at multiple locations, that means everyone else is being charged every time they modify their pizza, too. This is a special bummer because their motto used to be that they would do pretty much anything to make your pizza perfect, even if it wasn't a standard option.  As far as the food itself goes, this location is so-so. I started ordering from here last year to my boyfriend's east-side apartment and while it was fine it just seemed a little more run of the mill than my gold standard for GN, the University Avenue/Whitney Way location. Delivery was slower, portions smaller, and things leaned to the overcooked side."}
{"text":"I recently moved a bit farther west in Madison and when updating my address for Glass Nickel I saw that I fell into two delivery zones - the one I'd been patronizing for years off of Whitney Way/University, and the Muir Field Road location. I decided to switch over to my newly available location to see how it fared.   The Muir Field Road GN is fine - definitely still a step up from the national/regional chains. There were a lot of little things, though, that I just didn't care for in comparison to the other location: :: everything we was a little overcooked - the pizza crust was very dark and the cheese fairly browned, the Nickle Nuggets were dry and occasionally crunchy, and the Chicken Cordon Bleu sandwich we ordered was smashed flat and resembled a panini more than a hot sub (it was hard to tell if this was intentional or just got smushed in the delivery bag) :: the online ordering form offers less flexibility - I couldn't change my sauce for Nuggets (I'm not a huge marinara person and if I'm going to eat cheese-sprinkled chunks of fried dough I might as well ensure a future heart attack with some ranch), leave prep notes (like not overcooking them until crunchy), and in some spots the check boxes to complete your preferences for an item were redundant :: it took considerably longer for delivery than usual - this may now be the case for me with the other location as well due to the move, and it wasn't completely unreasonable considering it was a weekend night, but when you're used to the delivery driver ringing your doorbell in 30-45 minutes, an hour and a half seems like an eternity  I know these differences are somewhat nit-picky, and I'd like to restate that this location is a totally solid pizza place - I just like the other west side location better."}
{"text":"Home grown - He town Pizza... It's been awhile since I've been to the Glass Nickel. It feels like a rediscovery. I'm a fan of eating at local joints - and while there are several  Glass Nickels - this is the legacy location, the one with history - the one that feels like a joint!  The pies are consistent and tasty. They are well crafted so that you can get a Pizza with subtle flavors. You know you have  eaten a good pizza when you order a very simple pie and it's as good or better than a complicated one. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Pizza connoisseur checking in. This is one of the best pizzas in the area. Their pie is on the greasier side, heavy on the cheese, more heavily browned than most cheese. The cheese: you can taste it. For the NYers, I don't know why you'd expect to get NY pizza outside of NY, like a local delicacy outside of that locality. Perhaps your standard of measure, but I say you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Although Sal's is now my pizza of choice in Madison for the price, Glass Nickel is closer, and I'll be back for an occasional Glass Nickel pie.  They have a set of coupons that they run in circulars and attach to their pies--they're everywhere. The main one is to either receive a two-liter soda with a large pie, or to get $2 off $16 (or something like that). You can usually redeem the coupon without presenting a copy (since \"everywhere\" includes the pizza joint too). Honestly, I would just prefer the $2 off the large pie, which comes just short of $16 I imagine on purpose. Occasionally they do me a solid and honor the $2 off despite the slight discrepancy. They also had a dine-in cash discount when I was there (I've never seen this location particularly busy), but I haven't received it for take-out and haven't dined-in in a while."}
{"text":"I live well within the delivery window of this location (within a two minute drive according to Google Maps.) I've yet to get my pizza delivered in under 50 minutes, whether I order during a peak time or not. Tonight was the straw that broke the camel's back. After 40 minutes when I called to check on the status of my order, I was told that it had gone out for delivery 20 minutes ago, and that it would be with me shortly. After another 20 minutes, the pizza finally arrived. That is, it took them one hour to drive two minutes in normal driving conditions (no snow, nothing.)  It was cold and bordering on undercooked when I got it, and the box was bent. When I called to complain I was told that they would allow me to go through the same process for a replacement pizza. Since apparently the solution for substandard service is to make my wife and I wait even longer, and to pay for the privilege of doing so.  Although this chain is a step up from Dominoes, they aren't that special. I won't be ordering from them again, and will instead choose to order from their competitors. Ordinarily I don't review businesses online, but their repeated poor service and poor resolution compelled me to sign up for Yelp in order to leave this review. This way, at least, people will be forewarned before ordering."}
{"text":"Most people will tell you to order the Fetalicious....but, unless you are a vegetarian, you are missing out on all of the other specialty pizzas (and if you don't order a specialty pizza...you are doing it wrong)! The Chicky Chicky Parm Parm and The Ranch pizza are by far the most flavorful and dare say it...perfect pizzas I've had in Madison. Hard to beat Glass Nickel if you know what to order. These are take out staples.  Not to mention - a large pizza for two can serve as leftovers for a few meals - so although some say GN pizzas are pricey, they are filling!"}
{"text":"Never a bad time, nor visit.  Just by chance when something has went awry THEY HAVE EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE.   From purchasing the once a year deal to buying something off the menu to getting discount notice for paying with cash.... Glass Nickel wings, Fetalicious with Sausage and new monthly offerings - sets the standard for others.   P.s. Nickels in the tables.  P.P.S. each location has it's own vibe. P.P.S. I like studying at this one and appreciate the screen door."}
{"text":"Try most things. I've never had the fish. Don't have to have the shrimp again. The wings are fabulous for us. The subs are okay. The pizza options and sauces make life easier for us.   From purchasing the once a year deal to buying something off the menu to getting discount notice for paying with cash.... Glass Nickel wings, Fetalicious with Sausage and new monthly offerings - sets the standard for others.    I'm shocked I haven't written a review before now but this location has a vibe to it's own.   More suburban I'm apathetic to all things but nothing nasty or rude.   We've only ordered delivery from this location for work purposes and they go to Middleton.  Also part of the barter program."}
{"text":"The pizza arrived very quickly and it was very hot.  There was a LOT of large garlic chunks on the chicken Alfredo pizza (minus chicken of course!) so if you're not a huge garlic chunk fan, I'd avoid pizzas here with garlic on them.  The gal on the phone was fantastically sweet and the delivery driver was...not as friendly, but that's fine. You don't always have to be bubbly.  Lastly, the price was STEEP."}
{"text":"Someone needs to do some serious phone training at this location.I've ordered from here before, but they were never a staple for me. But my roommate was recently diagnosed with a gluten intolerance, and they prominently advertised a gluten-free crust option, so we started ordering from here instead of our preferred (pricier) pizza place.  Order #1: Took me 5 minutes to explain to the person taking my order over the phone that I wanted sausage added to a base special pizza. Really not that complicated. An hour and fifteen minutes pass, no pizza. Tried to call and inquire. Was immediately placed on hold and left there for 5 minutes. Hung up. Called back. Refused to let them immediately place them on hold (much to the person taking my call's surprise) and managed to ask my 15-second question. (I wanted to verify that the order had gone through, given the uncertainty level of the person who took it.)  Order #2: Placed online. Ordering system doesn't tell you an estimated timeframe of when your pizza will be ready for pickup. Called to ask. Was immediately placed on hold and left there for 3 minutes. Hung up. Called back. This time was actually allowed to talk to a human and ask my 5-second question. Went to pick up my pizza and watched them place someone else on hold indefinitely as we left even though no one was in line behind us.  I know this is a nitpick, but it really is atrocious from a service standpoint, and guys, this ISN'T HARD. If you have a customer in front of you, put the caller on hold, and then help them before you take the next customer. If you're too slammed to do that, at least pick up the phone between customers and let the person you've put on hold indefinitely know that you haven't forgotten about them and someone will be with them shortly. This is sort of Retail Phone Service 101.  The pizza is fine. It's nothing spectacular, but it's good. Some of the toppings are interesting but overall it's good Basic Utility Pizza, the kind of thing you order if you're having a party and want something nicer than Pizza Hut. I like the calzones because they're the size of my head and last two meals easily, but they do usually arrive still cold in the middle. Overall, it's pretty underwhelming, and certainly not worth braving godawful service for. I might still snag a calzone every so often, but the phone manner the last few times had me googling whether our favorite place DID have gluten free crust after all, and lo and behold they do, so our actual pizza orders are headed right back to Roman Candle where they apparently should've just stayed."}
{"text":"Warning: This is a review for people who enjoy reading reviews. TL;DR: Find another pizza joint.  Now for the rest of you, gather round. I aim to tell you precisely why you should travel a little further and spend a little more for your delightful pie.  I am happy to spend a little more on dinner if I'm receiving high-quality ingredients or a great customer experience. Unfortunately, I've never encountered either at the Muir Field Road location in Fitchburg, WI. It's a chain pizza joint - so I'm not expecting a loyal staff to sweep me off my feet, nor to be bowled over by the restaurant's ambiance. But it would be nice to simply receive what I ordered.   Apparently in contrast to many people on this site, I don't relish giving bad reviews. If I am dissatisfied with food or service, I will contact a manager during my experience. It's really the most effective way to correct a mistake, and often the restaurant will reward your earnest feedback with a complimentary menu item or a guaranteed discount for trying them again in the future. We in the service industry appreciate the chance to make things right before the customer leaves. Bad reviews circulate faster and longer than good ones.  Given that pedantic aside, I have to point out that I rarely give a place one try and then consider them verboten. My first experience with Glass Nickel Fitchburg occurred five years ago, mainly because my apartment was down the street. Pizza tends to be my lazy delivery choice. My partner and I were in the mood for calzones and thrilled that Glass Nickel was so close. As a vegetarian, she was pretty nonplussed to find her Spinach and Cheese Calzone was filled with sausage. Mine was too. Ok...maybe we got someone else's order. Not a big deal. I returned the calzones to the store, and the young counter staff seemed confused. I don't blame her, but there was no manager on site. Ok, that happens sometimes as well. I asked if I could leave a message for the manager. Her phlegmatic expression told me this act would be futile. I left and enjoyed pizza and calzones at various locations throughout the Madison area for a few years.  As months passed, I did reach a level unabashed laziness, and simply wanted Glass Nickel to deliver food to my face. I tried again with a calzone. Perhaps for old times' sake. I mentioned the episode from years back, asking if I could speak to a manager, hoping to at least ensure that my order was correct sometime, if not to receive some discount or incentive to reconsider Glass Nickel for my pizza dollars. Of course, I'm not sure with whom I spoke on the phone, but her sympathy and enthusiasm led me to believe that she could have a manager arrange a kind of discount, and this time, I would surely receive my Spinach and Cheese Calzone (I'm an omnivore, but I decided to mimic my partner's order for mythopoetical reasons). At this point, I'm sure you know what happened next: the calzone (and salad) was delivered; there was no discount; the calzone was filled with sausage and cheese.  I actually ate that one, and to Glass Nickel Fitchburg's credit, it was a very fairly executed calzone. I enjoyed it! The Greek Salad was also fine. I'm not contacting the Zagat Guide to inform them, but it was very fine chain pizza joint food. Just...not quite what I ordered. Again. It may have been my fault for bringing up the fated \"sausage calzone\" incident; that could have been transcribed into my order and misread in the kitchen. Who knows? I didn't bother contacting management this time. It had been a long day - my eyes were heavy, and my belly was full.  So now we fast forward to a few months ago - 12 November 2017, to be exact (I know, because I took a photo this time). What caused me to think of Glass Nickel Fitchburg on Muir Field Road? A gambler's love of adventure? A service industry hack's belief that times and staff will change and they deserved another chance? A sadomasochist's penchant for a finger to flame?  Nope. Just lazy, and it was cold out, and I didn't want to go far. I also really wanted a calzone. Damn you, my love of calzones!  So with rheumy sclera and baited breath, I peruse the Glass Nickel Fitchburg menu. I have an admittedly unusual hankering for the flavors of chicken cordon bleu - the crispy yet juicy chicken, the tender prosciutto, the tang of dijon mustard balanced by honey, the coup de grace of melted Swiss cheese to form an exquisite culinary bliss.  You know, but in calzone form. I was simply delighted to see that Glass Nickel Fitchburg offered both a sandwich and a pizza with similar ingredients to the famous dish. Was there a way for me to satiate my desire for this flavor profile while also being able to walk around holding it in my hand? I swallowed my breath, lowered my expectations, and called the Nickel.   A manager authorized my monstrosity. I salivated for a honey mustard-cheese sauce.  It arrived cold, doughy, and w/ a packet of honey mustard. Try Sal's Tomato Pies."}
{"text":"Yeah, I like Glass Nickel pizza.  Props for the biodiesel delivery truck, too.  I love their fetalicious pizza, that's a winner for sure.  The thing is, every single time (and I do mean EVERY SINGLE TIME) the service has been sheee-ite.  If you want to eat at the east side location, make sure your calendar is free because it will be a while before someone deigns to wait on you.  And never, ever, ever sit at the bar to order food.  It is like some sort of invisibility cloak comes over you and no one can see you there, just waiting."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed Glass Nickel in the past to be sure. To be fair, I somehow manage to enjoy most pizzas I eat. And I guess I always thought Glass Nickel was really good, but not really great. I'm not a fan of thick crusts or and overwhelming amount of cheese and toppings (though I'll still eat every last bite)  But you have to try Glass Nickel's thin crust - it's pretty amazing! And I've got to say, I especially enjoyed the thin crust with pineapple and green olives. Just trust me. It's sweet and salty with less cheese and less crust.   Like most pizza delivery places, it takes forever to get to you, but picking it up takes almost no time at all. And Glass Nickel has coupons on their website- making it even better."}
{"text":"I like glass nickels ground meats. They prepare them from scratch. Their crust was novel when they first opened in the nineties but after many years of eating pizza from the Madison area I now tend to go for either a thinner crispier crust or a full on pastry Chicago style crust. Not a fan of all of the weird pizza combos.  Love that they have fresh basil and garlic though! The sausage filled raviolis are excellent!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for something different on a pizza than the standard fare, then look no further! Glass Nickel has some outrageous combinations that all taste AMAZING!! Last time we ordered got the Fetalicious and the BBQ chicken, both are super delicious and must be tried at least once.  And they deliver to most of Madison, so even if you're at home in your pj's there is no reason to miss another night of not having some grade A pizza!"}
{"text":"It pains me to give Glass Nickle a 3-star but this place has been slipped over the past few years. I used to love it but now it's a \"meh\" in my mind. I've only had delivery so maybe that has something to do with it but the last four times I've had it the pizza had been made wrong or over-cooked, REALLY late delivery or it just plain tasted bleh. And they are quite expensive so I do expect more from GN and lately they haven't delivered (figuratively speaking). Don't even try to use the website to contact them about your concerns because they only give you an automated reply.  I'm giving it three stars just because I loved it so much once and hope that the recent experiences have been flukes. Worth a try though if you haven't had it before."}
{"text":"My fave pie is the \"Border to Border\" with a third of the cheese...the sauce is fantastically hot and the pie is liberally covered with jalapeno slices, canadian bacon and pineapple.  I've only ever had one bad item come out of this kitchen....a sandwich that was burned so badly, it should not have been allowed to leave the building.  This was one time in over 11 years of patronage, so this place is really pretty amazing."}
{"text":"The pizza is great, but the wings were awful. They give you sauce on the side instead of adding it to the wings..... What's up with that? The place also smells like it's not well cleaned.... It smells like lingering dirt."}
{"text":"Awful service. If you want glass nickel go to another location. A group of coworkers and myself place an order today. My sandwich was delivered with the side sauce cups completely broken open and spilled in the bag so much so that the bag was soggy, ripped, Falling apart and dripping with ranch/buffalo sauce. The driver told my coworker who brought it in that I could call for a new sandwich. I was ok with that option because I love this sandwich and order it all the time from the glass nickel Fitchburg location. My first phone call with the place was fine they had apologized for the error and said they would have another one out in a bout an hour. I then called back upon realizing my sandwich was made wrong as well to ensure they made the right one. It should be noted I placed the order with (perhaps the manager, because he casually worked in that he had been there ten years). They said they would make sure it was made right and have it out in an hour. An hour goes by with no sandwich so I call and they say they attempted a delivery. I had it delivered to a business they've delivered to for 10 years according to my conversation with the manager. But I still had no sandwich and apparently the delivery driver gave up and went back. At this point three hours after the initial order had been placed I was on the phone and told the manager this was unacceptable he responds with we only have one driver so delivery times can be delayed and that in 10 years they've never had trouble. I asked for a refund and he stated he would look into it. My card has been charged and I have never felt more disrespected as a customer in my life. My career has been in retail customer service so I know how customers should be treated. He was rude and non apologetic and only argumentative. I suggest they hire more delivery drivers and fire their manager and hire a customer centric manager. I feel bad for the delivery drivers as they must get run around crazy. I'm not even going to get into my coworkers sandwiches that were dry and their soggy fries...  End note: If you don't mind bad customer service and so so food then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza..  Delivery is normally speedy and always good. Delivery people are friendly and personable. I strongly recommend this for delivery. Going there is sometimes hectic to eat there, they seem to be super busy all the time."}
{"text":"I've been going to Glass Nickel with my family since I can remember. Always impressed with the service and the food is pretty good the majority of the time. Sometimes the pizza is great and sometimes, well, I  guess all places have their off days. Whenever I order from here, the same goes - the service is great and the food is usually pretty good too."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Madison. I live closer to Ian's so they win with convenience but not flavor.   Their hot marinara is delicious. They use great cheese on their pizzas. It's not the cheapest pizza in town, but I believe it's the best quality.  Their only failure is topping amount. It can be laughable and frustrating. I want more than 6 pieces of pineapple on my whole pizza! Rawr!  Their cheese bread is snazzy, as is their pizzas."}
{"text":"Plenty of pizza places in Sun Prairie to choose from, but I decided to try GNP. Went with half portabella Lugosi (to try) and half deluxe (for comparison purposes). Overall, the pizza was decent. The highlights were the sausage and parm crusted mushrooms. The drawbacks were the below average crust and generic sauce. The price is also pretty steep for a pizza that doesn't have a lot going for it. I'll probably go to Rocky's, Day-One, or Anna's before I'd consider this place again."}
{"text":"Glass Nickel now has vegan cheese as a topping option, meaning I can actually order a pizza with cheese in Madison. Pretty awesome."}
{"text":"I ordered food, it was cold and terrible.  They advertise 100% guarantee on their packaging. I called to complain a few hours later (I am a busy man, and I couldn't call right back). I was told that they couldn't honor the guarantee, because so much time had passed. I explained that 100% satisfaction guarantee leaves little room for argument, then I was told that Quinn the GM would call me back the next day. Quinn never called me back."}
{"text":"Honestly, it was just meh.  Nothing great or spectacular, certainly nothing amiss or terrible. I searched Yelp for \"the best Pizza in Madison\" and this was popped up. Now mind you, I was with the hubs, who is Italian and a native Chicagoean, so his pizza tastes and standards are a little high. He seemed pleased, but that could be because I am an amazing dinner date.  We parked in the lot that is shared with the laundromat next door. It almost looks like you are going in the back door when you enter the building, but the host stand is right when you walk in. We were seated quickly. Initially the hostess took us to an adorable elevated table, but the people who were seated in the table across from said table were, large people and it would have been a tight sqeeze. I was flattered at the compliment  (the host clearly though I was small enough to squeeze through the table and a man's gigantic back) but I would have appreciated the respect to be sat somewhere a little bit more comfortable. Because then my next question was, \"what about this 2 top over here?\" Which just makes me look like an elitist. She obliged and we were sat and greeted by our server almost immediately. Isabel  (I think!) was knowledgeable in the beer list (which is pretty extensive) and seemed to have the menu memorized. One of the first things I said was, \"we've never been here before\" which to me opens up the door to \"tell me about the good stuff!\" Nope, Isabel was all business. When she rattled off the different types of crust (one of them being \"hand tossed\") I had to stop her and have her explain the different kinds. There isn't a deep dish option, if that's what you are wondering. But that's okay. We ordered the delux, hand tossed crust with mushrooms only on half. It came in a timely manner and was delivered neatly. We enjoyed the pizza and Isabel was nice enough to box up the leftovers (which we enjoyed for breakfast the next day).  TLDR: food was mediocre, but good. Service was very business-like. Would order delivery, but probably not dine in again."}
{"text":"I wasn't planning on commenting on quality of food, but since other's have been experiencing the same issues...  We were very excited to move into Sun Prairie where there was a Glass Nickel Pizza nearby (we previously lived in the Milwaukee area).  The day after we moved in, we decided to order Glass Nickel to eat while unpacking.  The staff was fairly friendly on the phone, pizza came in the delivery estimate time.  Pizza itself was okay, but not NEARLY as good as the New Berlin and West Madison locations.  The next day, we became violently ill.  With the chaos of moving, their pizza was the only thing I ate all day so I'm sure that it was from this.  My husband and I are positive we got food poisoning from their pizza.  We do not plan on re-visiting the Sun Prairie Glass Nickel Pizza (especially after the reviewer stated that employees were cleaning toilets sans washing hands).  Such a shame!!"}
{"text":"Glass Nickel on the East Side of Madison is always good. I use to work there in high school before they branched out so much. It is still has good food and lots of the same menu. Can't complain! Our server was great too!"}
{"text":"Delighted with this pizza on my first night in Madison. Apparently a local chain, its not hard to see why this is a favorite. A large supreme style pizza was more than enough to feed 2 very hungry travellers and 1 delightful hostess. It wasn't hard to discern the quality of the toppings and that Wisconsin cheese :) Coming from Chicago, where excellent pizza is abundant, the crust did leave something to be desired. Otherwise, everything else passed my delivery pizza standards."}
{"text":"Glass NIckel Online Ordering System For Sun Prairie Store: \"Oh, you want to get delivery, huh? Well the minimum is now $20 for delivery, sucker!\"  Me: \"But that isn't even the price of a hot sub sandwich and side of french fries or tater tots. And I've ordered for less than $20 before. Even says 'Minimum $10 delivery' on the main Glass Nickel page.\"  Glass NIckel Online Ordering System For Sun Prairie Store: \"Well, that doesn't apply to all stores as all stores are independently owned and operated.\"  Me: \"Then I will independently avoid all Glass Nickel stores and franchises in the future. Your food is overpriced and overrated anyways.\"  So, yeah. I'm done with Glass Nickel Pizza for good. It's not worth it when there are competitors who only require a minimum of $10 for an order, and off the top of my head, I can think of two in Sun Prairie that have better pizza too."}
{"text":"Ordered online for pickup on a Sunday night. Glass Nickels website is a little confusing when placing an order online but in the end we got our pizza.   The Sun Prairie Glass Nickel might be the worst that I've had. Really light on the sauce and toppings, hardly even cooked. We ordered ahead of time so it's not like they had to rush it. They didn't even have to deliver it.   Customer service was poor too. They hardly greeted us and could care less that we were there. They didn't look that busy (I could be wrong) but I'm not really sure what the deal was. I think we will go somewhere else from now on.   Too bad because the Middleton and Fitchburg locations rock!"}
{"text":"Service was great! Went around 2 in the afternoon today (a Tuesday) and it was not at all busy. Ben (our server) was attentive yet didn't hover. He kept an eye on my glass and offered a refill accordingly. He also gave a good recommendation on the pizza (Boar's K---?) 3 meats with classic veggies. He also sent a sauce on the side for us to try since the only \"dressing\" was garlic & olive oil (it was a sauceless pizza otherwise). It was definitely a good time."}
{"text":"I wish I could give three and a half stars.  It's roughly 3-4 star pizza, its local, and environmentally conscience(+) but a little overpriced(-).  It's definitely on the high end of what you can find in madison in terms of quality and variety."}
{"text":"I love Glass Nickel! In my opinion, this is the best pizza in Madison. They're def better than Ian's or Roman Candles. I've eaten at the Atwood location, and the late night service was great. My friends and I shared a pizza and pitcher of beer and good conversation. We didn't order anything other than beer, but the place has full bar, and I heard that the downstairs bar get quite funky (in good way) on some occasions. It's a good place to hang around on the east side."}
{"text":"I don't give many five star ratings, but I can't think of anything I don't like about Glass Nickel. To be honest, their Border Crossing pizza is something I seriously crave. It's always done exactly the way I like it, because all the info from my previous orders pops up when I call. So convenient. I recently ordered one for pickup when I got into my car on Langdon St., and by the time I reached Atwood, it was ready. Amazing! Prices are reasonable and there are always coupon codes to use, just check online.  The staff is friendly and laid back, and the dining room is somewhat dim and intimate, with very cool 50's style light fixtures suspended over the tables. They have a really nice, if slightly limited, tap beer list that changes constantly. They usually have some Three Floyds selections, a big plus.  Last but not least, they have a SUPER fun improv comedy show on Saturday nights that has never failed to be a blast. I always take out of town guests there and it's always a hit. It sells out quickly, so order early. The ticketing process can be a little wonky, but it's very affordable, and it usually all works out."}
{"text":"This is about as good as pizza in Madison can be. As a man grown from Chicago, I understand the limitations Madison has, but Glass Nickel does pizza and service right. I've been to the East side location and gotten kindness, camraderie and warmth all the way. The pizza is piping hot, tastes good, and has a lot of variety and color.  The atmosphere is quite casual, the food is good, and the people are nice. The prices are a tad high, so I don't go that often, but if doing delivery, they are reasonable about delivery fees compared to the rest of Madison. This place is pretty phenomenal."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA EVER! Boaris Karloff has so many flavors to attack your palette! So good! This is a pizza with no red sauce, just great toppings and cheese on a yummy hand tossed crust (of course, you could have a different crust, but why would you?).  The base is garlic and olive oil and the toppings include banana peppers and a slew of meats! Seriously, the best tasting pizza!   Oh, there are also several beers on tap, and if you start with the nickel nuggets, you'll probably have some leftovers to enjoy another day.  If you are in the mood for some great tasting pizza, this is the place!"}
{"text":"First time order, it was delivery and was wrong. Ordered Italian sub and turkey club was sent. Disappointing when that's the only thing you ordered."}
{"text":"The Fetalicious pizza is the bomb! You do not need to be a vegetarian to enjoy this pie!"}
{"text":"Went here with my wife and 2 kids last weekend when we were in Madison.  Server was excellent.  Ordered the Nickel Nuggets to start and they were excellent.  Kids couldn't stop eating them.  Pizza was delicious.  Finished up with the Cinna-nugs for dessert and they were awesome!  Would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for excellent pizza."}
{"text":"Overrated.    No, make that vastly overrated.  There, I feel better, I needed to get that off my chest.  When Glass Nickel Pizza burst on to the scene in the late '90s, they mopped the floor against weak-ass competition like Domino's, Pizza Pit and Rocky Rococo with their innovative topping combinations and fresh ingredients.  However, as local pizza market has evolved (enter Pizza Brutta, Salvatore's, Café Porta Alba, Grampa's, etc.), GNP was content to rest on their laurels.  Now it's GNP getting their butt handed to them by the new breed of pizzerias.    So word to the wise, ignore those \"Best of Madison\" accolades, they are based on past reputation and not current performance.  The problems with GNP start with the crust - dense and largely flavorless, it overwhelms the other components of the pizza.  It's all chew and no crunch.  It also tends to be soggy in the middle, especially when you order vegetable or soft cheese toppings (yeah Fetalicious, I'm talking about you).    The tomato sauce is OK, not as bright as I would like and at times, a little too sweet.  Their pies could use more sauce to balance out all that bland crust.  The quality of the cheese is a step below Madison's top tier pizza joints and a step above the Pizza Huts of the world.  Topping quantity varies from order to order. Sometimes GNP generously applies the toppings, while other times Scrooge McDuck seems to be in charge of the topping dispensing operation.  If you handed me a slice of Glass Nickel Pizza, I'd certainly eat it, but it's not a destination for a great slice of pizza anymore."}
{"text":"Okay its a pizza, and that means I am going to be tough. However, I think I am getting soft, or its just too cold to be mean. This is not pizza in the sense of NYC or North Jersey pizza. It is pizza in relation to Dominos or Papa Johns, in fact it is better than both and why I gave it three stars. It is a meaty crust and as such, it can handle toppings. The cheese is not a fresh creamy mozzarella or a buffalo mozzarella, it is just the standard pizza chain pizza cheese, rubbery and bland. However, Glass Nickel is a better pizza than those national chains. I would recommend ordering a pizza with a lot of toppings and extra cheese. You will be pleased."}
{"text":"Love their pizza! We always order for delivery. I've never eaten in any of the restaurants. Everytime it arrives piping hot as well as any sides I've ever ordered."}
{"text":"I love the selection the delivery menu has to offer.  I just ordered mac and cheese bites, pub chips, a sandwich and some ravioli.  Everything was delivered within a half hour and was warm.  The apps were really good, the sandwich was ok, and so was the ravioli.  Maybe next time I should just stick to pizza instead of branching out.  Prices were a little steep but otherwise a good experience."}
{"text":"Glass Nickel Pizza was a go to pizza joint for at least a year straight for my wife and I. We always ordered the cracker crust pizza, and often chose between the \"Couch Potato\" and the \"Deluxe\". Both have amazing flavors.   Couch Potato is one of those pizzas that you don't think will work but then you end up eating the whole pizza. I mean seriously... Bacon, cheese, fries & broccoli on a pizza, dipped in sour cream of course.   The Deluxe is the perfect balance of fresh veggies, pepperoni essential imo, and that sausage has some serious wow factor.    Thanks for the great memories while I lived in Madison. When i'm back in town for business I will have to drop by again for a Za."}
{"text":"I LOVE Glass Nickel pizza. Is it the \"best pizza in Madison\"? I say almost. The Thai Pie is my absolute favorite - it has a peanut sauce with mozzarella over it along with peppers, chicken, and broccoli. It's amazing.  In fact, most of their specialty pizzas are freaking delicious and you cannot go wrong with them. (My second favorites are the Fetalicious, Veg Out, and Alfredo Pizzas) I also adore the fried macaroni and cheese.  It's 9 parts tasty, and 1 part \"omg, I'm eating fried macaroni and cheese and I'm going to have a heart attack at 40.\""}
{"text":"I'm giving them two stars because they were open late and delivered to my hotel room--and they had corn as a topping...oh, maybe I should give them three stars, I don't know...  But can I just say: This is not pizza, people; it's bread with pizza-like sauce and tasteless cheese.  It's only a step up from Domino's and a small step at that.    My lil' nashers couldn't handle that amount of gluten."}
{"text":"Let me start off by we ordered a pizza and called 1 hour and 30 minutes later to ask where it was, on a Tuesday. They informed us that they had an order for 27 pizzas at 8:00 pm (we ordered at 6:39), they were not apologetic and acted like we should \"have known\" it would be late. After he didn't apologize, I said, \"I hope it isn't cold\" he didn't really say anything and we got disconnected.  When the pizza finally arrived, it tasted good, but was room temperature. The jalapeño poppers were definitely good, but not very warm.  This would have been a great meal, had it been hot when it was delivered."}
{"text":"The feta pizza was delicious. Great portioning of toppings with incredible flavor. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would... I ordered some pizzas for my office and on the phone I was told 30-45 minutes... It has now been two hours and we are still waiting. Extremely unimpressed with this Glass Nickle Pizza.. WILL NEVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing. It's so nice to have a local pizza place with vegan options. Yes, OPTIONS! Plural! I haven't had pizza with cheese in over a year (only ordered without cheese from other places) and this pizza is the best thing I've ever tasted!! And they do NOT mess around with toppings! My pizza tonight was fully loaded!! I ordered the vegan pad Thai with green peppers and pineapple (and less the onions and cilantro). Plus the pizza was delivered in a timely manner!"}
{"text":"We ate here due to the fact we were here for the Monkey Business show, so I can not speak for the upstairs restaurant service.   The service though for downstairs show was great, even though it was a full crowd all seated at the same time. Husband ordered a cheese and sausage pizza and I ordered a calzone. Both were very good and I would definitely return to try some other menu items. While the calzone was not the best I have had, it was still good.   We only ordered Spotted Cow beers on tap, so I can't speak to their bar skills.  Service was acceptable for the environment."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza.  The fetalicious is a must try pizza.  They have a variety of really good high quality entrees.  Salads, subs, pizza, lasagna.   I have eaten here many times and never had a bad meal."}
{"text":"Awesome staff, healthy food. Try anything that sounds good, and report back to us. :) OR the management. LOL."}
{"text":"Improv in the basement! Oh, pizza is alright too.  Salads are where it's at for me though, here."}
{"text":"My husband being a native New Yorker is always searching for a decent pie. He enjoyed Glass Nickels pizza and plans on coming back.   I thought it was okay but I am an Ian's Pizza junkie."}
{"text":"Not too happy.  Had sandwich and salad delivered.  Salad was missing croutons and salad dressing.  They said they were bringing them to me,  not going to eat salad without at least dressing as have none here, and it took almost 45 minutes to get croutons and salad dressing!  Sandwich was mediocre, will not be back again!"}
{"text":"I was staying in Madison for the night and I didn't have a ton of options for delivery and I was just hungry. I would never order this (because it's usually frozen), but because I was by myself, I ordered the lasagna. To my shock and awe, it was delicious. Really really good for a pizza place. Is it your Mom's or Grandmas? No. But it is damn good. I wish I could have tried the pizza because it looks delicious as well. Next time!"}
{"text":"Love their new space! Delicious drinks, good pizza, huge fresh salads, and now great atmosphere.  My favorite meal is a Caesar salad with spinach cheese bread. Pay cash and get a discount? Sweet!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and an impressive beer list.  Their gluten free pizza has never gotten my celiac family members sick. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just want some takeout pizza. And you want more than the big chain Pizza Hut, dominoes, papa Js, etc. Well, this place is the solution. Great pizza at an affordable price in a reasonable time. First time, and probably not the last. My new go to takeout/delivery pizza. Thanks for making my late Friday night delicious!"}
{"text":"So far, Glass Nickel has the best pizza that I've tried in Madison. They're quick to deliver, easy online ordering, and they notify you via email when your order is out for delivery!  Their menu includes some interesting specialty pizzas. I've tried the Sacre Bleu, which includes canadian bacon, salami, and blue cheese (YUMMO!). I've recently been privy to the Fetalicious. They have a lot of other cool combos that look intriguing.  4 stars because Glass Nickel isn't the most amazing pizza I've ever eaten in my entire life, but it's a great go-to pizza delivery joint!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch in the way home from visiting Alpine Valley on the way back to Minneapolis.  Kids wanted food, parents wanted quick and easy.  As soon as you walk in the door the smell of tomatoes and oregano hit you in the face (in a good way).  We had the Couch Potato (wanted something different) and it was fantastic.  Potatoey-bacon goodness. Exactly like eating a baked potato in a hand held delivery system straight to my mouth. Kids had spaghetti and ravioli with meat sauce, and both smelled amazing, though I didn't get to try either as they pretty much scarfed it down before I could. Pretty nice eclectic beer selection with a few I'd never heard of. All in all, we'd definitely stop in again if we're back in the area."}
{"text":"Make sure you confirm your delivery order.  I ordered a salad with ranch dressing and they sent French dressing instead.  Update: yet another screwed up order via delivery thru what they claim is a third party site Eat Street.  It added 20 sauces to my order and when I told the delivery person that I did not order 20 sauces they told me to take it up with eat street not them!"}
{"text":"Ordered over the phone late on a Friday night and the pizza was never delivered. We asked specifically if they were still delivering and they replied yes, took our order and credit card information, and then never delivered the pizza. Because they were closed an hour and a half later when we realized they weren't coming, there was nothing we could do to resolve the issue. I've had their pizza on other occasions and I've never found it worth the price. If you decide to get glass nickel, I would recommend only doing pickup and building your own pizza. The specialty ones are never good."}
{"text":"Another entry in our pizza tour of Sun Prairie! We have ordered delivery from Glass Nickel several times over the past month and have been happy with our meal every time!  The cobb salad is one of my favorites to order as a side dish, as well as the spinach cheese bread. We like several of their pizzas, fetalicious is my favorite, but the border-to-border is also very good (but spicy!). My husband always chooses the ranch pizza.  It's not the cheapest pizza place, but the price is competitive with similar pizza places in Sun Prairie, and is usually worth it!"}
{"text":"First time trying Glass Nickel and it wasn't the best experienced. Waiting over an hour for our food to be delivered which wasn't a big deal. But the food tasted like leftovers. Was greasy and had no crunch to it. Pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"The variety of ingredients is unmatched, especially when it comes to delivery places. They're also very mindful of people with food sensitivities and allergies. Always friendly and helpful if looking for a deal!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and cheese sticks for a Monday night delivery (not during football... no major events or weather going on). Got the notification that order was out for delivery.... it arrived 34 minutes later. We live about 2.7 miles from GNP. When I called and explained both were cold, the \"manager\" Ed - not sure if he really is, but when I asked to speak with a manager - he said he was.... said that since we ordered thin crust it would be almost impossible to keep that warm.  No - if the driver had gotten here in decent time, it would have been warm. If it had been in the warming thermals properly, it would have been warm. It was barely tepid. But yay - delayed dinner, lackluster customer service, manager that seemed bothered we called to point out the food we ordered was cold - got me a $5.00 credit for my next order. About the same customer service that I had when I got food poisoning a few years ago from deep fried ravioli (same location).... pretty sure I got a $5.00 credit then too. Thinking we will be avoiding GNP for a while."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza in a bar setting.   The pizza topping varieties allow you to try a new topping or an old favorite every time you eat here. They have a few speciality pizzas that have great combinations of flavors for you to try.  They also serve a number of local brews so you can enjoy pizza and beer to your heart's content.  If you want your pizza delivered, they have a fleet of delivery vehicles that are at your beck and call. Once you order, your pizza should be delivered warm in a really short time, barring unforeseen issues.  Try this pizza restaurant once and you'll be hooked."}
{"text":"Walked in at 5:30pm on a Thursday night. Not busy at all; asked bartender if we could sit wherever, said yes. We sat there in a booth for FIFTEEN MINUTES! No one came by ever and we were right in view of the bar! We ended up walking out! We always go to the Madison location and thought we'd try this one since we enjoy their food and service. Sun Prairie location= Never again."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza with varied selections from traditional, new takes on old ideas to gluten-free choices...great service. Take out recommended."}
{"text":"Best delivery pizza I've had since moving from Chicago. The Fetalicious is amazing, and makes me wonder why I don't have feta on my pizza all the time... Delicious pizza for cheap. Awesome pizza joint!"}
{"text":"Went here last night after receiving a much appreciated coupon in the mail for $10 off any purchase.  Atmosphere was good, server was very nice, beer/wine selection is decent...most importantly, the pizza was good (but not excellent).  The menus were very sticky and the wine list had some pizza sauce thumb prints all over it....a dirty menu annoys me because if they don't clean what they know you'll see....what else don't they clean.  I hope it was a fluke.  I would like to come back for their trivia so I'll give it another try soon!"}
{"text":"Trying tis place for the first time....they get five stares.   Wide variety on menu, plus build your own.  If some one in your group doesn't want pizza, they have variety of other items also.     Staff is professional, and pizza is great.  One of the best I have had since I moved up here."}
{"text":"The best lunch/dinner/late night snack pizza option in Madison. I always go with their special of the month, because they have too many flavors and it's too hard to decide."}
{"text":"This place keeps going down, down, down ... rubbery dough, cheap ingredients and crappy cheese. Sandwiches come complete with stale bread and cheap supermarket ingredients, I can make a much better sandwich at home. The service is awful and slow, so we're done with GN! Interesting how many 5 star reviews they have given how bad the food and service are."}
{"text":"Glass Nickel's hand tossed pizza crust is always wonderful. We've enjoyed GN for years now. The regular crust is chewy and tender, with enough thickness to hold all the toppings without it being too bready of a pizza. You can request regular, thin, thick, cracker or gluten free also.  This last time we ordered 2 delivery pizzas; the Boaris Karloff, and the David. The David is the pizza of this month, January. Toppings are a Florentine base with artichokes, spinach and a touch of classic sauce topped with chicken, tomatoes and house-blend cheese. I enjoyed it, but feel like the artichokes and spinach were added lightly. I'd love for the artichokes and spinach to be more prominent flavors on this pizza.  The Boaris Karloff ended up my favorite of the 2 pizzas! This pizza had genoa salami, pepperoni, capicola ham, banana peppers, tomatoes, five blend cheese, herbs and spices on a base of garlic and olive oil. I normally turn away from any double/triple meat pizza, but this specialty pizza had a delicious balance of toppings. They all shined, and made this a treat for the taste buds.  Great pizza!  Always have had friendly delivery people!  Highly recommend Glass Nickel for your delivery pizza."}
{"text":"Very good pizza for the Madison area. Delicious. Had delivery and it was still hot despite being 15 minutes away. Cardiac arrest pizza super good. Sauce is ok but not anything worth writing home about."}
{"text":"WOW!  We have come to the Glass Nickel to see the improv several times in the past but it has never worked out to eat at the Glass Nickel.  They are usually really busy or we're short on time.  We've seen others order during the show but find it disruptive to the show and we didn't want to be those people.  So this time I called ahead to see if we could make a reservation, they said no reservations.  I asked if I could order ahead so the pizza could be ready when we arrived, they said no preorders.  He told me that when we get here we could order and have it delivered to our table though.   When we arrived we were about 10 minutes early to be seated.  We tried to order but the woman that was managing refused saying they don't take preorders.  I was confused because we were physically there ordering and doing what the guy had told us on the phone.  The woman was just outright rude about this so we went to get in line to go down to the show.  She then came over and snapped at us about standing off to the side, which is where we've always waited in the past.  She said we were a disruption to their paying customers.  (There were only two gentlemen eating at a table near us and the other two tables were empty.). The lady was just rude.  If my tickets for the show wouldn't have been prepaid, we would have left.  The way we were treated told us loud and clear that the Glass Nickel doesn't appreciates the customers that Monkey Business is bringing right to their doorstep.  The Improv is the only reason we ever come here in the past and after today I don't see coming back anytime soon for even that.   ---------------  Once we were seated for the show (10 mins later) we were able to order a pizza.  It arrived just before the show, so we had to eat during the show.  The pizza was dry and had several bubbles.  After everything we'd gone through it was nothing to rave about.  Sadly even the drinks tonight were really poor too.  We ordered only one each and then just drank water.  The water was ok."}
{"text":"I was very excited when I looked over the menu in preparation for my delivery order. Unfortunately, I was a lot less excited with my experience.  I tried to order online, and it was very obviously not working. So i called my order in, and it took over an hour to get here, despite only being a few miles away. Delivery is slow for a lot of places, though, so I kept an open mind. It didn't last long. My mozz sticks were ice cold. Now, I know it's chilly out, but delivery drivers have ways to keep things warm, right?   I ordered a chicky chicky parm parm pizza (someone let Tom Haverford know about the copyright infringement), and the pizza was okay, with the exception of the chicken. The chicken topping the pizza was *SO* overcooked, it was like tiny chunks of chicken flavored leather. SO disappointing, because I was really looking forward to this. I also tried a Portabella Lugosi, and it wasn't half bad. But they didn't cut it into squares like I requested. No big deal. But it wasn't amazing like I expected it to be. Especially since Glass Nickel came highly recommended by a loved one.   i don't recommend, and I won't be back."}
{"text":"I like these guys.  I wish I could give them more stars, but the price is what keeps me from doing that.  A large pizza is going to run you at least $ 20 and it's just not $20 pizza.    They're creative and tasty, but too expensive for what they serve.  Order to-go or delivery--the dining room needs help at the one in Sun Prairie."}
{"text":"LOVE their Meat Lasagna! I always get an order of their Toasted Cheese Ravioli for a starter"}
{"text":"This place literally saved me when our group's long day of delayed flights and frantic running thru airports put us in Madison late.  Nearly all the restaurants were closing their kitchens, but Glass Nickel's kitchen is open until midnite, AND (this is key) they deliver.  For a business traveler with no rental car and not wanting to risk driving in the snow and ice, this is a huge convenience!  I got a sandwich and salad, and even though they said it might take as long as 45 minutes, there was a knock on my door in more like 30 minutes.  The sandwich was still hot and the salad greens were still cool, so I give them props for getting the order right and even getting the food to me at a nice temperature.  Highly recommend if you are the Middleton area with no room service or few options for dinner.  Save this number in your phonebook!"}
{"text":"In love with this pizza! We don't live nearby but make it a point to get this whenever we're in town. Perfectly baked crust, perfect toppings, doesn't get any better. Not greasy, crust is not limp, toppings are baked just right. We get half pepperoni/cheese, carryout. Easy to find and park, staff is courteous, pizza ready when promised. Always a winner."}
{"text":"Ordered a large Chicken Parm and it showed up dry and crispy. As if I had paid $25.00 for a Great Value box pizza. I called and asked if I could have it replaced and that I would gladly return the old one. The woman I talked to on the phone was polite, the manager on the other hand was not. Not only did he argue with me on whether or not he personally put sauce on the pizza but he made it out of his way to make me feel inconvenient. From a frequent visitor, it makes me apprehensive to order again , especially when the manager doesn't have time for me."}
{"text":"Good quality pies.  Gluten free available.  Never had a bad pizza.    Last time we went in there were to many flies buzzing around."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I ordered delivery -- it took about 30 minutes but they should have taken longer and properly cooked the food. The fried mushrooms were so undercooked the batter was raw and I couldn't eat them. The pizza toppings (Fetalicious) was good but parts of the crust was doughy. Overall, I have had better from Dominoes -- with their new Pacific Northwest specialty pizza."}
{"text":"Glass Nickel Pizza has the ambiance that we typically look for in a Pizza/Pub joint.  The place is dark (cozy, not creepy), warm, comfortable, and quiet.  They have friendly and professional waiters that serve frosty adult beverages and good pies.    We ordered their Deluxe (Supreme), because the staple pies make comparisons much easier.  The pizza is good, but not amazing.  It is a hand tossed, New York style dough.  The dough was a little bit blander than we like and there wasn't much rise in it (no yeast or too cold for it), but the toppings/cheese were really good and deserve a solid 4 star rating.  Something that we didn't see mentioned in other reviews are their Hot Wings.  They serve really good wings here that deserve more recognition.  Our waiter was awesome enough to bring out two sauces for us to try (we couldn't make up our minds) and we liked both the buffalo (needs a little bit more spice though) and jerk (great smokey flavor).  You can never go wrong with $4 Bloody Marys w/ chasers or $5 Nitro Milk Stouts.  Don't make the mistake of drinking the beers too quickly or you'll miss out on the designs drawn in the foam."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Madison, and right up there with my favorites in the country.  Yes they are now an uber-chain throughout college towns in Wisconsin but they make great pizza.  The dough is great and they always brown the cheese, which I love."}
{"text":"Great pizza place for anyone new to Madison or just visiting.  Besides having delicious pizza, the service there is superb. A few times I have ordered online in order to use a coupon and the coupon did not work.  Without question, they accommodated me!  I always give praise for great service and this is no different.  They deserve every star just for service alone.  Enjoy your pizza!!"}
{"text":"Easily the best pizza you can have delivered in Madison.  Go all traditional if you like and get your standard sausage & mushroom pizza that you always order (and then proceed to the standard missionary-style sex).  However, Glass Nickel's specialities are where they shine.  The Cardiac Arrest, the Fetalicious, and the Santa Fe are some of my favorites.  Sandwiches and salads too if pizza isn't your bag.  One downside: every once in awhile you'll get a pizza that's pretty sub-par.  However, I think that's part of any pizza delivery experience."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY THE BEST PIZZA IN THE AREA!   We drive over an hour for this and it's worth it every time! The gluten free crust is ABSOLUTELY THE BEST, the place is clean, the staff is fun and friendly!   Thank god for GNP!"}
{"text":"Visiting from CA & arrived at the hotel on a sunday night (yesterday). I didn't have a lot of options but the front desk suggested this place. I got the shrimp sandwich & jalapeño poppers for delivery. The food took a while & when I called the restaurant, the workers sounded baffled bc my order had been lost. It wasn't until the manager (Matt, I believe) came on the line to help me out. I guess the driver had gotten lost & went to the wrong hotel. In the middle of my meal, I realized I didn't get a receipt so I called back & the manager was willing to drop it off on his way home. I thought that was really sweet but I insisted he drop it off tomorrow. I still woke up to my receipt & I must say, I was really impressed by him. The fact that I'm from out of town clearly means I won't be a regular here, so he didn't have to go out of his way. It was unfortunate my food was late but unlike the servers who answered the phone & casually just said my order wasn't placed, then handed the phone to the manager because they didn't want to deal with me, the manager going out of his way to make sure I was happy really stood out to me. Also, the food really IS delicious."}
{"text":"I continue to order from Glass Nickel because they offer a wide variety of options including build your own salads which I LOVE. The salads are pretty big and they have a great selection of toppings.   The reason I give Glass Nickel 2 stars is because they mess up my order 4 out of 5 times. Sometimes it is as simple as forgetting to include a dressing or sauce, but not always. Several times I have had someone else's food delivered. Tonight was the worst yet. It took about an hour to get the first delivery. It was similar to what I had ordered, so I thought nothing of it...then I opened the bag and realized I had someone else's food. I called the store and told them what happened. The apologized and said the would remake my food and send it out \"right away\". 35 minutes later I have no food. I call back. I am put on hold and have THREE different people pick up as if I were calling for the first time, \"Glass Nickel. Can I help you?\" YES! Get my order to me ASAP! Finally, I am told that my order is on it's way and should be to me in 10-15 minutes. Oh, so you haven't even left the restaurant yet. Great.   Food finally arrives. Different delivery driver. He is very nice and apologetic. However, not once was I offered anything for the trouble. I do not usually expect something for free, but when I have to call back a second time just to get my order corrected there ought to be something done for my trouble. We will definitely think twice before subjecting ourselves to the unpredictable service offered by this location."}
{"text":"It is unfortunate but this place has really gone down hill, but their prices are high. Food is always lukewarm and all seems to taste the same. We have been disappointed the last several times. We then wait awhile and order again (mostly because the delivery options are so limited where we live) hoping it will be better, but it is not. Last night the delivery person complained our driveway was hard to get out of??? WTH? Could someone come up with decent delivery on the far west side???? Hurry."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery to our hotel room. A medium pepperoni and a medium cardiac arrest, which is a meat combo. What we liked best was the flavor of the sauce, which was pretty darn tasty. We were disappointed in the amount of cheese and toppings; for a $19.00 pizza, pretty lacking, we thought. We ordered a salad too, and were not impressed, pretty lackluster. Our favorite item was the cheese breadsticks, pretty yummy and the marinara sauce was good. I guess our main complaint was what we got for the money, almost $60.00 for 2 very average medium pizzas, a salad and the cheese sticks. The driver had to go back for the salad as it didn't come on the original delivery. The driver was great, very friendly and nice, and the pizzas came pretty quickly, so that's the positive."}
{"text":"I order from Glass Nickel a lot. At work it's a favorite, so we get it often. I don't order it at home as often, but it's definitely something we enjoy.   The delivery is usually pretty quick, even during \"peak\" hours. Ordering online is nice, but the website does go down for some reason occasional. I just phone the order in if that happens.   The pizza is fantastic. I have several favorites.   Aside from the pizza, though, their other offerings are delicious, too! Their salads are always super fresh and packed full of tasty ingredients. They don't skimp at all. The toasted ravioli is very yummy. The fries are good, but better eaten in the restaurant. Fries don't seem to travel well as a delivery option. The fish dinner is great. The chicken is great. Really, the whole menu is done very well."}
{"text":"Got this as a delivery while I was staying at the Sheraton in Madison.  I got a calzone and it basically sucked a$$.  My partner liked her pizza.  The salad was totally lame.  Lettuce, and a slice of cucumber.  Ive had much better."}
{"text":"i love their shit.  it's bombastic.  their vegan options are killer and their fries are stuff, man.  the stuff. their acropolis salad is fuhhhhmazing.  so good.  so tasty.  yum."}
