{"text":"We ended up at Ravi's Soups on Queen Street a few days ago, after a failed attempt to check out E.L. Ruddy (they were closed).

Ravi's Soups had a big group of people waiting for wraps, so that was a nice sign. They had a veggie wrap on the menu, and a vegan soup option. That said, I wasn't excited about this place from the very beginning.  Service was weird and all over the place, there wasn't a line waiting by the time we were at the counter, but he was still frenetic and rushed, but the food didn't come to us for quite a long time, and as with most simple vegetable dishes, I feel like I could have probably just made the wrap at home.

The veggie wrap normally has brie in it, and jut as a heads up, one of the unlisted additions is mayo... so you know if you're vegan, ask for it without, or just skip it and just opt for soup. (or go somewhere else.) The wrap came with a tiny salad, that of course, had \"just a little bit\" of mayo on it, I guess \"a little bit\" of mayo is the same as \"no mayo\"? Not quite.

My friend had the wrap and the Porcini Mushroom Soup and loved it. It's based on an onion broth, and has mushrooms, barley, and truffle oil in it, so it's actually vegan. However, soups all come with a cheese biscuit.

This place, like most of Toronto's restaurants, is great for lacto-ovo-vegetarians, but going there made me wish I had gone somewhere else on Queen that was a bit more vegan friendly with more exciting options."}
{"text":"I really love the butternut squash soup here... It's one of the things that has always stayed consistent even after the change of hands after the owner passed away.  


Curry Lamb Wrap - Good 
Has a great spicy kick .... Perfect for winter and autumn days. 

Chicken Wrap- Good 
Chicken is tender and cooked simple but well. Can't go wrong with the chicken. 

Steak Wrap- Usually great but last time was way over cooked... They need the cook to keep a closer eye on the meat to make sure it's still pink on the inside of the beef.... 

The fact that it was over cooked made me think maybe they downgraded the meat quality ? Regardless now I will only be going there for soup!"}
{"text":"Food might be good, still unsure, just got home. However I am upset from my pick up that they did not state after I ordered three full sandwiches and then convinced on the phone to upgrade for more money to a combo that they give you a half sandwich and a half soup. I can understand the soup being smaller but when you bloody order a full sandwich you better get a whole one unless you stipulate otherwise. This food better blow my mind. I will not be talked into another deal like that again. Most places an upgraded combo still gets you what you ordered!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here today as Ravi just opened up a restaurant in my neighbourhood. The restaurant is lovely and looks like it will have a gorgeous patio set up for the spring time.  The decor is earthy, modern, with a bit of exotic thrown in.  Love the long reclaimed wood table and the mosaic tiled tables on the patio.

I had the Porcini Mushroom bisque, which was served with a really large and tasty freshly baked cheese biscuit.  Everything came to about $10, but in my view it was very much worth it as it was a soup I would definitely not make on my own and I have never eaten anything like it: filled with mushrooms, herbs, and brown rice.

The staff was extremely sweet: they did not have their debit machine set up and as I didn't have any cash they let me walk.  Of course, I will pay them back when I return to try the other soups! They are also starting up a brunch menu here which I am looking very forward to trying out!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot! Have been coming back a few times and the food has always been grrrreat.

The combos seem to work well together. My absolute favourite soups have been this far the butternut squash soup and the curried apricot/red lentil soup. Amazing tastes and textures. They are very filling too. The service is friendly and fast. Suits for a quick lunch but is definitely not just a lunch place."}
{"text":"I work near the original location on Adelaide so I have been many times before, and now I live close to this Queen St.W location which is fantastic for these cold miserable days we've been having.

As a long time lover of Indian food and flavours there is something so satisfying about Ravi's apricot and red lentil soup. Ordered by itself you get one of the best biscuits I've ever had, flaky and buttery, with some of the best red pepper jelly I've ever had. They're also a perfect accompaniment as the soup serving is not enough to satisfy me on it's own. I have tried the chicken hot pot as well and the noodles are the star of that dish, along with the bok choy (a fave vegetable of mine) but I tend to go for the rich creamy lentils every time.

On the wrap front, you can't get much tastier than the curried lamb wrap. I also love the chicken wrap (which is quite similar with the addition of chipotle mayo instead of mango pineapple salsa. The lamb however is so perfectly cooked it just melts in your mouth. What Ravi does best in every dish is the marrying of flavours, sweet and spicy, hot and cold. The soup and wrap combo for 10.99 is an incredibly filling lunch and great value if you're hungry.

4 out of 5 stars is because I find them somewhat inconsistent especially between the two locations. Sometimes I have had edamame beans in the chicken wrap for instance, and gone to the Adelaide location to find none (they add a nice texture in the wrap too so I was disappointed).  

Regardless, I think they're up to 3 locations total now and I hope they continue to expand!"}
{"text":"We ordered an all vegetarian meal, including the oven roasted veg wrap, to go. Got home, found a load of chicken in the veggie wrap. Called the restaurant and they said they'd give half off of on our next wrap. We're vegetarian! Not impressed."}
{"text":"Had a Ravi stew which was delicious, good flavours and textures using a myriad of ingredients. The right balance of exotic flavour and comfort food. Nice heat. But the price was a bit outrageous. The stew came to $11.40 for a bowl of soup (that was too large to possibly finish anyway) and a scone."}
{"text":"One of the all time classics in the TO food industry. A simple formula with great execution. The lentil and chicken wrap is a consistently tasty deal. Ravi goes above and beyond with a cool seating set up featuring a massive communal wood table inside and enclosed private patio during the summer.

Perfect for grabbing a quick bite for lunch or a cheap dinner."}
{"text":"really dig ravy. soup/wrap combo for $12 is as good as you get in this area."}
{"text":"Probably my favouite lunch spot in the financial district.  Butternut squash soup with caramelized onions and pear along side the curry lamb wrap with mango and pinapple.  Nothing touches this amazing duo for $10."}
{"text":"Ravi Soups you are delicious, fast AND inexpensive! 

Everything I've had here has been delicious. My personal favourite is the corn chowder with crab. it comes with a small biscuit with spicy jelly. Very good and a nice touch. Be warned though - the soups are quite large so be prepared for a meal.

I've had the wraps a few times (flank steak last time - I think that it was a special) and they were also all delicious. 

The space isn't anything special so if you're looking to grab a quick bite and head out somewhere else then you're fine but don't come if you're looking for a fancy night out. 

Very highly recommended for quick casual food."}
{"text":"What a find! 
The best fusion style soup around. Their corn crab meat soup is to die for. 
Cute but stylish decor
Great service
Wraps are really good too but a soup and wrap combo is almost too much food for one person unless you are super hungry. 
The Giant communal style table is perfect for goups.
Patio looks great but haven't checked it out yet as I only come here in fall/winter months."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best healthier lunches in the area, at very fair prices. I got a chicken wrap & red pepper bisque, for around $10 together plus tax. Will definitely come back - plus it looks like a nice place to eat-in too; great for a big group in the back or small tables on the rear patio."}
{"text":"I had the grilled veggie wrap which was absolutely mind blasting. Honestly it was perfect I would not change a thing about it. The goat cheese salad was excellent as well, very small portion but still delicious nonetheless. Corn chowder was very good as well!!! It was amazing and the service was very good to I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I finally checked out the Queen West location and was not disappointed! I had the Porcini mushroom soup with wild rice, truffle oil and shallots. It was hearty and full of mushroom bits. I would probably say it was the best mushroom soup I've ever had. It also came with a decadent cheese  pastry with red pepper jelly. The entire meal was surprisingly pricey. It came to almost $12 including tax. The price will prevent me from becoming a regular but I absolutely will go back to try other soups. Two thumbs up"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try Ravi Soups and I just happened to be in the area for lunch to try it out. It didn't fail to impress me! 

We got two soup and wrap combos and everything was delicious: 
- Corn chowder: creamy and surprised to see a lot of crab meat in it. Loved that it had a bit of heat to it. 
- Curried lamb wrap: very flavourful and the roasted yams really complimented the curry flavour. 
- Ravi stew: chock full of chicken and veggies!! 
- Chicken wrap: lots of chicken and the chipotle Mayo was a nice touch. 

All the ingredients were really fresh and the flavours were on point. Would love to come back and try their other items!"}
{"text":"Delish! Lost a star over restaurant ambiance but food is good. The coconut broth could use more noodles though."}
{"text":"The pork shoulder wrap with tamarind sauce has been so good (4 stops there in 1 week!), I haven't even made it to the steak wrap the other customers rave about. The decor and staff are casual and not intimidating, and the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Food is good but no wow factor. I had the Ravi Stew which was thick and hearty. 2 bees constantly buzzed around killing our Ravi buzz."}
{"text":"Sure, the summer rains are warm this year. But if you're under the weather, it might as well be the middle of December.

Ravisoups turned out to save my wife and I a sick day or two, staving away flu-bugs with the broth equivalent of an oven-warmed duvet.

I had the corn chowder bisque, she had the chicken hot pot broth, both were delicious and accompanied by obscenely good cheese buns with red pepper jelly. The quality of the ingredients are readily apparent when you peek behind the counter, but don't do justice to your senses until you begin swallowing hungry mouthfuls. This is good stuff.

We also split a organic chicken roti-wrap that wasn't necessary, thanks to the generous food portions, but was a fantastic compliment to the soup. The menu features a soup and wrap combo which is apparently a scaled-back portion of each and will probably what I'd do next time since I like both so much.

Prices fall somewhere between the hipster-gouging and afraid-to-set-foot-inside-the-hole-in-the-wall-you-call-a-restaurant that characterizes Queen West fare (That translates into a possible daily lunch spot for us)."}
{"text":"best corn shower ever. the flavor profile was phenomenal and each spoonful just kept getting better and better. I could eat this by the gallon!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here to warm up after walking around the city for a bit, and it was absolutely delicious! I ordered the corn and crab chowder and flank steak wrap combo. My friends ordered the butternut squash soup and a chicken wrap. The soups were full of flavor and depth, and the wraps were super filling! I loved the edamame and chipotle aioli in my steak wrap. This is definitely the place to go if you want a healthy, delicious meal. 

Also, bonus points for the awesome wooden table in the middle of the dining area!"}
{"text":"Wow! Just tried the curried lamb wrap to see what all fuss was about, and it truly is delicious!! So flavourful and the meat is melt your mouth! Would highly recommend. Soups are really tasty too (I've tried the corn chowder and curry apricot), but the lamb wrap is my all new favourite! LOVE"}
{"text":"mmmmm soups... 

It's not often you get to slurp good soup to your heart's content and still have some leftover in the bowl (why is soup always served in such negligible portions?). Here at Ravi Soups, you get a nice big bowl of gourmet flavours like curried lentil and apricot, roasted corn etc. etc. The soup really takes the cake. 

But then, you go on and make a stoopid mistake like ordering a wrap. And in the sharpest contrast ever, get served what should be hospital food: soggy white wrap, boiled chicken and unmemorable filings. In one word: Sapless.

Reader Poll: Have YOU ever dipped your wrap in your soup?"}
{"text":"Favourite go to soup place in toronto. Their wraps are amazingly good- free range chicken is delicious fresh white meat with yams baby spinach and carmelized onion- grilled to perfection. Their butternut squash is my go to soup but the beef miso is also delicious. Soup/ wrap combo approx $15 a person"}
{"text":"Lamb wrap was delicious. Mushroom soup was nice too. We really enjoyed the patio outside."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars

I just moved into the neighbourhood and had spotted Ravi Soups while out and about I wanted to give them a try. 

Service was fast and efficient and quite busy as it was the lunch hour rush. I ordered their free range grilled chicken wrap and butternut squash soup - the wrap was a little bland but still good, the soup was quite spicy and could have been a little thicker consistency but still enjoyable! 

I definitely plan on going back and giving a few of their other wraps and soups a try, but I won't be rushing to make it happen."}
{"text":"This place is a gem, hidden away near Adelaide and Spadina. The food is great and the variety of soups and wraps they have is sure to please everyone. Service is fast as well but the seating area and ambiance leaves one a bit wanting. Still, especially considering the price, the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"I don't even like soup, so I thought.  So amazing.  Beef miso changed my life.  I can't get enough.  Take out is great.  My husband and I usually get 3 different soups to eat for dinner and lunch the next day.  I have not tried any of the sandwich or wraps."}
{"text":"Customer service here is incredible. Everyone who walked in was greeted by the staff. Although it may not instantly look 'elegant' the food here is creative and delicious. This place comes highly recommended. #TwoEntrepreneursApproved"}
{"text":"I first tried this place a while ago, and ever since then, I haven't been disappointed. 

The place is small so it's not great for big groups (6 plus). Just a heads up.

The food there tastes like its prepped right when you order, which is a big deal to me at least! 



They have great meal combos (wrap + soup) that fill you up just right!  I ordered the chicken soup with the beef flank steak wrap, and I have to say it's probably my favourite combo there. 

The chicken hot broth contains a hint of spice but it balances well with the other savoury flavours. The flank steak has a nice balance of freshly cut steak, and sweet potatoes, and the other ingredients just compliment the two main ones. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone who loves fusion foods. (It's sort of a mix of wester/eastern from everywhere type of fusion). 

Only downfall is space and if you're not into spicy foods, your options are a little more limited. That is unless you ask for certain items to be spice-less, but then that defeats the purpose of the original taste."}
{"text":"Quite excellent. A bit pricey but worth it for the amazing flavour combos and filling portions. I've had the curried lamb wrap which was chock-full of delicious meat, sweet mango, and zingy flavours. The corn chowder is great too with shreds of crab meat. Can't wait to go back and try the other soups and the steak wrap!"}
{"text":"Upon entering, it seemed like it was simply a take-out joint, but we noticed there was some seating behind the cashier counter. There's an area at the back of the restaurant with a large communal wooden table as well as a small patio behind the restaurant. Although it wasn't too busy when we arrived for a late lunch on a Saturday, I imagine it's a pretty popular lunch spot. 

The menu is written on the blackboard and all the options sounded mouth-watering. If you only get their soups, they range from $7.99 to $8.99 which is a bit pricey. They also offer a soup combo which comes with a wrap and a bowl of soup for $10.99. I believe the portion of the soup that comes with the combo is smaller than a regular order of soup. 

I ordered the curried lamb wrap - with roasted yams, baby spinach, mango pineapple salsa, lime chili and mint cilantro. I was surprised to see that they made the wraps fresh to order. It certainly isn't fast food since after assembling them, they heated them up on the flat top.  It was a decent sized wrap, filled with a generous portion of lamb. I liked that they wrapped the filling inside the baby spinach so the tortilla didn't get all soggy. The flavour of the wrap was amazing. The curry was really flavourful and the meat was tender. All the ingredients just went really well together.  I highly recommend this!

I also ordered the corn chowder - with blue crab, thai basil and crispy shallots. The wrap and the soup came served on our own personal lazy susan's, which was something definitely different! The crab in the soup was nice and the crispy shallots were a great garnish to the dish. The soup itself was great, but I actually found my wrap to be better than the soup.

My boyfriend ordered the roasted free range chicken wrap - with roasted yams, baby spinach, caramelized onions, tomato chutney, chipotle mayo. This wrap was another winner. The combination of all the ingredients worked really well and the chicken was nice and moist. 

He also ordered the Porcini mushroom wild rice bisque - with crispy shallots and truffle oil to go with his combo. This soup was out of this world. It had a strong mushroom flavour and was simply delicious. Definitely order this if you're a fan of mushrooms!

Although the place itself is one of those hole-in-a-wall type restaurants, the food itself makes up for the lack of décor and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to Ravi because of the rave reviews on Yelp -- very disappointed!

I ordered the chicken stew and my boyfriend had the soup and wrap combo (mushroom bisque and the steak wrap).

The soup was delicious for the first few spoonfuls, but after a while, both of us found the soups to be overly salty and overly peppery! Both soups tasted like we were devouring pepper soup. 

The only high note was the cheddar biscuit, which was particularly tasty."}
{"text":"Excellent service. And excellent soup. Apricot lentil is my go too.  The veggie wrap is also really good. This place never disappoints."}
{"text":"Soups are delicious especially the porcheni mushroom soup. Warps are large and filling. Prices are a tad high for a soup place."}
{"text":"Foodora e-mailed me with a $12 voucher and I've been looking to try this place for some time so I got the ravi slaw, corn chowder, and the steak wrap.

Positives: fresh healthy ingredients, unique menu, fast service 

Negatives: ravi slaw was questionable, mediocre taste?

Overall 3.5 stars: everything was just meh- reading these other reviews I guess I expected too much. The corn chowder and the ravi slaw were a bit disappointing for my taste, and the steak wrap was weird at first because there were too many yams until I got to the center and found the BRIE CHEESE which made it so much better (man I love dem cheezez). Maybe I'll try a different menu another time seeing as all these other reviews seem to be loving it."}
{"text":"Excellent lentil soup and the server was kind.  The only issue I had was that the place was open, but most of the food was not ready to serve. This is a bit misleading. Other than that, this place is awesome."}
{"text":"Amazing soups and amazing wraps. Best place ever to eat delicious food. I think this place is awesome."}
{"text":"for $12, my soup combo was not to expectation. The lentil was far too
watery. Also this is the second time I ordered where the server would handle my food with his bare hands and handle the money as well..
without washing his hands....A real turn off for me"}
{"text":"There's not one thing wrong with this place.  Totally unique, fresh and good-for-you food.

Again, the good Yelpers come through.  4 1/2 stars, eh?  (I am in Canada, so flake off you hoser).  Right on the money.

It's a casual place.  The lunchtime crowd was young, diverse and hip, a typical slice of downtown Toronto.  Order at the counter after looking behind the counter on the wall at the menu.  One note:  I failed to notice several other soups and wraps that were offered that day because they were in clear placards on the top of the counter.  No big deal, because what I ordered was fabulous.

Here's the deal:  soups and wraps, a couple of sides and drinks.  But the soups and wraps are really inventive.  Get the combo meal, which offers you a smaller bowl of one of their soups along with a smaller wrap of your choosing.  $13 and change.  

The 'smaller' is a bit of a misnomer here.  Both the wrap and the soup serving size was perfectly adequate to fill the chasm that was my tummy today.  If you need a full size bowl of soup or wrap, the things look gargantuan.  

The vacuum in my gut was filled by the Lamb wrap (which has yams, spinach, big chunks of tender and lean lamb simmered in a surprisingly spicy curry.  And somewhere in there was the home run:  mango chutney salsa.  This almost candylike sweetness totally balanced the heat from the curry.  I couldn't eat it fast enough.

And the soup I tried was the corn chowder with little chunks of crab meat.  Also excellent, but perhaps a few more chunks of crab meat would have made it sublime.  

There's a massive single table made out of the center of an enormous tree, ringed with at least 14 stools.  Community eating.  Also a few smaller tables around it, along with room for 4 at a window table.  If the weather is good, they have a very inviting patio past the main dining area.  They'll bring the food to you--just listen for your number to get called.  Oh, and grab a glass for water and fill it up as you walk to your seat.

Final bit of perfection:  they serve beer.  Nothing puts the heat out of some curry like a frosty malted libation.  I will come back again and again, rain or shine."}
{"text":"Happy to find this location after enjoying the Adelaide location.

Once again fabulous!  Had the butternut lemongrass and pear soup.  Soul fulfilling.  Great flavour combination.

Also had my favourite wrap - lamb.  Again great flavour combination."}
{"text":"Best Soups in Toronto!

I used to work in this area and used to go here at least once a week.  The soup and wrap combo was great value - around a $15.00 lunch.  I love the Poricini Mushroom and Wild Rice Bisque and the Corn Chowder.  For someone who tries to limit my meat intake these are some very tasty and filing veggie options!  If you just go for the soup it comes out to just around $10 and you also get this great biscuit with a pepper jelly.  This place must safe guard all their recipes because it is definitely more valuable than gold!"}
{"text":"Fast, delicious, warming and affordable. Cant go wrong here. i have yet to have a bad experience here. Been here dozens if times."}
{"text":"A little overrated here on Yelp.  It's ok but end of day it's just a soup and wrap joint.  Not a cheap one either.  I had the mushroom \"bisque\" which had no cream in it so not sure how it can be called a bisque.  It was pretty flavourless to be honest - was in dire need of seasoning.  The chicken wrap was good but nothing really that special.  I think this place gets pretty high reviews because people seem to go crazy for anything with some Indian spices in it.  It also has the kind of location and decor that will make the average suburbanite feel downtown cool for having eaten there."}
{"text":"My friend and I came in for a late lunch on a Wednesday afternoon and ordered a curried lamb wrap and beef miso soup. The seating area was a bit small, with a large communal table and three small tables that can seat 2-4 people. The place wasn't busy though, so we were able to find seats pretty quickly. We ordered our food at the front and a friendly server brought it to our table within 5 minutes. The portions were large, hot, and filling. My lamb wrap was delicious! The meat was tender and I really enjoyed the combination of the spiced lamb and the sweetness of the mango-pineapple salsa. Unfortunately for my friend, the miso beef soup he ordered turned out to be spicy. This is a person whose favorite 'spice' is salt, so he had a hard time with this soup. It might be a good idea to mention the level of spice on the menu, since there's nothing in the description to suggest that this is a spicy soup."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Not a big menu- mostly soups and sandwiches and it's small and filled with people so you know it's good. I had the mushroom soup which was very tasty and a sandwich.  It's a perfect spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Wow, if I lived in Toronto, I would never get tired of this place.  I had the Chicken Hot Pot Broth soup with a Roasted Free Range Wrap and my wife had the same wrap with the Ravi Stew.   Both were excellence but I liked the Ravi Stew the best. I would go out of my way for this place!!!"}
{"text":"When I am in Toronto (which seems to be quite often these days) I always stop by and see Ravi for lunch.   Ravi makes some of the best soup I have ever had in my entire life.  I give the wraps four stars but hey his specialty is the soup.  Oh, and the chocolate banana bread, which I think is a little too expensive, is really tasty."}
{"text":"Mushroom soup was good but way overpriced!"}
{"text":"Amazing soup and funky atmosphere at a reasonable price. You wont be dissappointed, even if you dont want soup you can get a wrap and their scones are amazing!!"}
{"text":"After reading many good reviews on this Soup and Sandwich place, I have decided to come by during lunch to give it a try.

I had the Soup & Sandwich combo (Corn Chowder soup & Pork Shoulder sandwich). Both are delicious. The ginger inside the soup really gives it another flavour. I love the pork shoulder sandwich as well - they give a generous amount of meat inside their sandwich.

Everyone who works there are super efficient, from ordering to sitting down to receiving our food, I completed the entire dining experience in less than 20 minutes! More than enough time for my 1 hour lunch break. 

I will certainly come back for more. Thanks Ravi Soups!"}
{"text":"Wonderful wraps as well as soups. Ingredients are unusual and fresh, making every meal worth the long lunch lineups. Enjoyed the roasted pork shoulder wrap just today ($7.99). The combos are a great deal at $10.99 (half a wrap, small bowl of soup), too."}
{"text":"Good soup, but Ravi must be rolling in cash. Considering what it costs to make soup, this place is very very expensive."}
{"text":"It's a diamond in the rough. This place is always crazy busy and that's for good reason - the food is insane. Get the soup and wrap combo, you get the best of both worlds. Go for the mushroom soup if you want something rich and filling - if not try the butternut squash with lemongrass and pear (my personal fave). And for wraps you're safe with any choice! Th flank steak is spectacular though.

Hint: Don't forget to check out the enormous family-style table at the back made from a single tree - such an awesome element in the space."}
{"text":"Wow this is seriously the best soup in the city. All the soup is excellent. The wraps are also delicious.  I come here all the time and I've tried all the soups and all the wraps. They're all great, but my favourite soups are the mushroom and the curried apricot. My favourite wraps are the curried lamb, and the seafood wrap (which is sometimes featured as a special).

It's pretty small and gets crowded at lunch so try to go early or late.

Writing this review made me so hungry I am going there now!"}
{"text":"Came to Toronto to visit and after walking in the cold and snowy day with soaked feet for a couple hours this place was the perfect stop. My friend planned to take me here because of the soups, which are amazing! the soup + wrap combo is a very filling meal, in a good way. The ingredients are very fresh and light. The feel of the restaurant is lunch room-ish, but the food is made of excellent high-class feeling recipes. The kitchen is small and open on the way to the dining area, so you see everything prepared, nothing hidden. I need to come back and try another soup + combo next time I visit t-dot."}
{"text":"I love this place and eat here about once every 2 weeks. The food is always delicious and good portion sizes. I have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"This place should have the best soup in Toronto. The service is fast and the soup was delicious but not awesome. Actually can't imagine the taste of the best soup ever!"}
{"text":"Yum.  Come here all the time for the veggie wrap.

The only negative is they are pretty slow to take your order (usually more than 10 minutes)."}
{"text":"Their lamb and flank steak wraps are seriously out of this world. I'm not a soup person but most of my friends like the Ravi stew. For us this is more of a takeout place - it gets a little loud to have a decent conversation :)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. The food is delicious, in abundant quantities and always an interesting selection. It is a small, hole in the wall kind of place and the seating is limited. The have a backyard patio which is nice and quiet. The lamb wrap and the corn chowder soup are amongst my favoruite dishes."}
{"text":"I went with my Dad for lunch last week. We got there relatively early before the lunch rush, so it was not too crowded. After order our soups and drinks, we snapped up a couple of seats on the back patio. Although the space is not large it oozes with character. I absolutely love the large communal table in the middle of the indoor dinning room. The table itself is a gorgeous piece of wood and I like the idea that it encourages people to mingle with strangers. 

I had the Porcini Mushroom Bisque. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It had a wonderful earthy flavours which were nicely balanced. I don't quite remember what my Father had, but I believe it was whatever the soup of the day was. I did not try it, but he was just as pleased with his soup as  I was with mine. 

So If you work within walking distance, or just happen to be in the neighborhood,  this is a must try for lunch."}
{"text":"Ravisoups, where have you been all my life? I've been working on the edge of the Entertainment District for almost 3 years and I just found out about this place a few months ago. It's not in a location you'd usually walk by...it's on Adelaide west of John, just a little bit past where you'd think anything would be.

I've only been for lunch along with all the other suits who know the Ravisoups secret. Most businessmen seem to be in too big of a hurry to stay, but they have a very comfortable and serene back patio, as well as a giant communal table inside.

You can either get a soup, a wrap, or a soup & wrap combo (recommended). I'm not much of a soup guy myself, but Ravisoups has me on my knees praying for forgiveness from the soup gods. Each soup is made to perfection using a variety of flavours from North America and the chef's native Sri Lanka.

If I had only been to Ravisoups once, I would have recommended my first menu choices (flank steak wrap and red pepper bisque soup, oh how I remember you well). But after trying almost everything on the menu, you can go wrong. Pork shoulder wrap...corn chowder...roasted vegatables wrap....miso hot pot....just keep on coming back to try everything on the menu.

Go. Now."}
{"text":"Walked right by this place without even realizing I had missed it!  Walking inside, it looks like it might just be a take out place, but then you realize there are tables in the back.  The kitchen/cash area doesn't look like much.  In fact, I don't know how they manage to cook such great food in such a small area!  A friend and I ordered two different soups, and two different wraps so we could share.  I ordered the butternut squash soup and the curried lamb wrap.  She ordered the flank steak wrap and the corn chowder soup.  Everything was good, but the corn chowder soup was the clear winner, and the curried lamb was really, really good!  The butternut squash soup could have used some extra seasoning, however pairing it with the curried lamb, which was seasoned very well, was a good decision.  I can see why people return here as the food was very very delicious, and made with quality ingredients."}
{"text":"After approximately zero bad reviews out of almost 150 amazingly glowing ones, I felt compelled to try this place for lunch today.

Perhaps my expectations were over inflated after reading so many great reviews, or perhaps my taste buds disintegrated after my six-block-walk-in-the-heat-wearing-jeans from my office to the place, but I left feeling slightly disappointed. My free-range chicken wrap was ''nice'', but definitely not anything to rave about. Certainly not considering I paid over $10 just for a wrap.

The size was very generous (more of a burrito than a wrap!), the accompanying ingredients were fun and creative (yams!) and the chicken was of great quality, yet still the wrap seemed to lack flavour. There was no 'wow' factor for me that justified the price and the hype (and my long walk....grrr....)

There was a huge amount of chicken in the wrap, which some would appreciate, but for me the over abundance of meat overshadowed the other ingredients and the sauce and made me feel as though I was eating a lightly seasoned, almost plain chicken wrap. 

Again, fine, and very nice, but just not standout enough for the price and all the super-positive reviews. 

And allow me to be old-fashioned for a sec - the radio was excessively loud!"}
{"text":"Dropped in looking for a quick bite whilst in the area. This place completely blew my expectations out of the water. The lamb wrap was an absolute stunner--could've eaten two more. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great lunch spot.  It is one of the best in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Soup is amazing. My favourite are the coconut chicken soup with their chorizo wrap!! It's a little pricey for just soup and wrap ($13-15) but soups are very hearty. They present it on a lazy Susan if you eat in store. 

Would come back!!"}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype. Such complex flavours and well executed. This place flys under the radar but is worth the visit. A concise menu but the choices are great.

I had the curried lamb wrap and corn chowder. Both were satisfying and full of amazing flavours. 

I will gladly take a long lunch to visit Ravi's.

Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable! 

Flank steak wrap and the curried apricot soup were fantastic. 

Good value for the combo at $10.99 for decent portions of soup and wrap.

Very busy during lunch hours on weekdays but worth it.

Note: Every dish is somewhat spicy, not overwhelmingly so but if you can't have any spice this is not the place for you.

Overall highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great selection of outstanding soups.  Wraps are spot on, big portions, fresh ingredients.  Recommnd both the curried lamb and mexican chorizo wraps.  Very friendly service, priced appropriately.

Go to spot downtown for lunch and also dinner when not looking for fancy sit down with a wait.  No frills but great food and good service."}
{"text":"I had the roasted veggie wrap and it was great! The only problem with the setup of the place is that there's usually a very long line for lunch which makes the front portion of the restaurant unusable for eating, and then if you get takeout you have to wait awkwardly right beside the kitchen portion being in everybody's way. However since \"too many people want this food\" is their biggest problem, they seem to be doing pretty well! :P"}
{"text":"Place is nice and open.  I tried the chicken hot pot.  I think. It was ok,  lacking a lil bit if flavor but not too bad.  But for $11? Ummm I am. Not sure.. May be I was expecting a lot from this place"}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place
Finally did for lunch a couple of days ago.

Theres a huge communal table in the back and a few in the front. I ordered the Corn Chowder with Blue Crab (comes with a cheese tea biscuit) it was delicious!!
They have daily specials too, which is a nice change up.

I'll definitely be back to try the wrap and soup combo!  I've been looking for a soup place for quite a while and finally found it!!"}
{"text":"Very good soup. Great variety and fair pricing for the quality.
Always try to stop by when I'm in the area.

Yay I'm a fan"}
{"text":"One of the best wraps in the downtown core! I recently found out about this place from a coworker and I'm addicted! Make sure to try the flank steak wrap when you visit!"}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this place for about a year now and finally, on a very wet and rainy day I made the trek to Ravi Soups to grab some dinner.  Wet and damp, I walked up to the counter to order the porcini mushroom soup with a chicken and the roasted free range chicken wrap.  The meal ended up costing about $12 - which is sort of on par when in comparison to places like soup nutsy.  Anyhow, after one sip of the porcini mushroom soup, I was totally sold!  It had to be the best soup I had ever had.  The ingredients in both the soup and wrap were fresh and I found that the mix of the flavours in the soup quite unique and yummy.  Ravi has definitely won my heart with its soup and I can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Ravi Soups...
The hidden palace, just go and try for lunch.
Usually I take the combo butternut squash soup and veggie wrap, I love it. I also like the atmosphere, the padio in the back, the simplicity. Just go and try."}
{"text":"The three C's - Crab chowder; Curried lamb wrap and Cheese biscuit. My first meal in Canada - and I was hooked. When friends ask me what I remember the most about canada I do not recall the CN tower or the Niagara Falls or the beautiful snowflaked mountains in Vancouver - I remember Ravi soups. Why do we not have places like these in Sydney?"}
{"text":"Nice and small place. You have to order before sitting down. The dishes are mainly soups and wraps.

When you go to the sitting area there is an awesome large wooden table where you can sit and eat with other people.

Both soups and wraps are freshly made without the long wait.  The soups are served at perfect temperature and very tasty, very comparable to those served in fancy restaurants.  The wraps are super delicious with very unique blend of flavours.  They are not dry and prepared in a way that eating it does not get messy.

Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"Checked out Ravi soups based on yelp reviews, I had the lamb curry wrap and corn/crab soup, my fiancé had the pork shoulder wrap and porcini soup. The lamb curry wrap was the favorite and would consider going back for this if needed a quick lunch. The pork wasn't as flavorful, didn't find the soups great either."}
{"text":"Ravi Soups is THE BEST place around for soups and wraps. 

I recommend the steak wrap and the mushroom soup, but you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.

Portions are perfect, and presentation and atmosphere even better when you order in. There is not much else to say other than give this place a try, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, quick service.  The soup bowls are deceptively filling"}
{"text":"Been here on several occasions and I always go for the soup and wrap combo. 

The curried lamb wrap is my usual, packed full of flavor and lamb isn't dry at all.  The pork shoulder isn't bad either, there is pineapple in this one which adds a nice contrast but the pork does get dry in some places.  

The soup is what I really come here for. The blue crab and corn chowder soup is by far the favorite here.  There isn't much blue crab but the flavors are right.

One of my go to comfort places for when I need warm soup and quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Delicious wraps and sandwich combos! Amazingly fresh taste. They've got their sauces down. The texture of the wrap is thin but crispy. 

Curried lamb is my favourite wrap, chicken is average (good quality chicken but too much yam), the pork shoulder is very filling and a bit dry but that can be fixed with their delicious sauce as a side on the plate.

The mushroom soup is my favourite. Clam chowder with crab was very good too, you can really taste the cran. Ravi stew is alright, it's on the spicy side. 

There is a backyard patio which is nice during the warmer months. It's a little dead during dinner time but the quality of food is just as great.

I wish they would keep updating or change up their menus!"}
{"text":"the food is average. My favorite is the green salad with loads of garlic flavor ($4.99).  The soups contain a ton of sodium, so all you high-blood pressure clientele beware!  They need to add to their menu items such as burgers or fries to improve the options and attrack more customers!"}
{"text":"Amazing combination of delicately prepared wraps with complex soups for a good price. 3 of us ate our fill with 3 beers and a biscuit to boot. We were all pleasantly surprised at the quality and taste of the food and the fact that the place wasn't super busy during saturday dinner time. (830pm). 
We had flank steak wrap (4.5*)with corn chowder (I don't like sweet soups so 3*), chicken wrap (4*) with porcini mushroom soup (4*) and lamb curry wrap (4.5*) with Ravi stew (4*). Biscuit was pretty good and came with chilli jelly. Decor wasn't bad. Just had some fruit flies flying around. 
Recommended. Try them out."}
{"text":"Delicious soups and wraps. Awesome décor and friendly service. I love their outdoor seating area, with its vibrant colors, it made me feel like I had just found one of Toronto's hidden gems.  That day, my tummy was filled with the corn chowder and wrap combo for $10.99: Curried Lamb Wrap (with roasted yams, baby spinach, mango, pineapple salsa and mint cilantro),  good stuff, and Corn Chowder (with fresh blue crab, thai basil and crispy shallots), delicious! We also got the cheddar cheese biscuit with red pepper jam, it was good but nothing mind bogglingly tasty. My friends got the Roasted Red Pepper Bisque with mild curry, tiger shrimp, thai basil and crispy shallots $8.99. In all honesty it wasn't as spectacular as the corn chowder I got hehe...

But with all that said, it is a bit on the pricey side for soup which would keep me from going in for a treat more than once in a blue moon."}
{"text":"I love this spot! Steak wrap is delicious and the coconut noodle soup is perfect for a cold day. Healthy and filling, and consistent."}
{"text":"Amazing food for a very affordable price. There's a few tables to enjoy the great platters on. If you're a little pressed for time, but still want a quality meal downtown, I would check it out. I highly recommend the soup!"}
{"text":"My go-to spot for a work lunch!  I go to Ravi Soups at least once a month...more often particularly in the colder months.  I usually have a the wrap and soup combo and leave with a full stomach.

The coolest part is the communal table in the back.  It's a great spot to make new friends."}
{"text":"This is without doubt the tastiest wrap & soup you will eat in Toronto. 
I have tried a few different offerings but for me the flank steak with Brie is the best. It's simply delicious. This, served with one of their soups is perfect. Really filling but not too heavy. 
The place itself is nice with an amazing big communal table. During the summer they open a nice quiet patio out the back. 
Service is prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Nothing beats something warm and hearty on a cold winter's day. The staff are really friendly and service is prompt. I tried their Curried lamb wrap and Ravi stew on one occasion and on another their porcini mushroom wild rice bisque and their Flank Steak Wrap. 

From the recommendation of the cashier, I got the Ravi stew which had a nice kick to it from black pepper. The Ravi Stew was hearty with various vegetables and chunks of meat. The Curried lamb wrap was really flavourful, it had a good amount of both vegetables and meat.

Their mushroom wild rice bisque was no joke, it was filled with mushroom and had a nice peppery taste to it. It was so hearty and paired with their Flank Steak Wrap, it made such a winning comfort food combination. The Flank Steak Wrap is usually good but when there's the perfect amount of sauce and wrapped so it doesn't fall apart, it's amazing! There's something savoury about having a wrap with sweet potatoes which gives the otherwise regular wrap a unique twist.

I highly recommend getting the combo since it's a great deal."}
{"text":"Never had such a delightful gourmet soup experience, Ravi Soup is tops! 


Ordered 2 soup and wrap combos to go..  gonna eat this outside to enjoy the hottest day in Toronto 29C this year.

Wraps:

1. Roasted free range chicken - with roasted yams, baby spinach, carmalized onions, tomato chutney, chipotle mayo

2. Grilled flank steak wrap - with roasted yams, caramelized onions, baby spinach, mushrooms, brie

Soups: 

1. Butternut squash soup with asian pears and lemon grass
2. Ravi stew  with chicken, wild rice, edamame, mushroom, baby spinach.


The soups have a bit of kick to them. (they are spiced up). Be aware if you're not used to that. Love them though because the combinations of flavours work. Asian pears and butternut squash who wouldn't known?

My favorite item today has got to be the grilled flank steak wrap. the melted creamy brie with the soft steak and sweet yams formed a blessed heavenly union.

At Ravi's you're getting great fresh gourmet food for a reasonable cost.  For two combos it was about $26 tax inc. Ravi I'm a fan can't wait to try some more."}
{"text":"Amazing soups and sandwiches. I got a wrap-soup combo with the corn chowder and the lamb curry wrap. Both were delicious and a perfect combination of sweet-spicy. Not particularly cheap but still highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is always busy, but they serve people pretty fast too! I had chicken hotpot soup and lamb wrap for couple of times, and they're definitely delicious. It's not like fine & gourmet cooking, but it's favor and quality are awesome. 

I think their soup ideas are interesting, with multiple ingredients and spices, definitely taste better than those typical soup recipes. The full size soup with a biscuit are enough for me, and I don't mind having soup as a meal!"}
{"text":"Found out about this gem through a friend. I've only tried 2 of their wraps and soups so far. The soup/wrap combo is a good deal and good portions....I can barely finish the wrap.

- curry lamp wrap (4*): I know this seems to be everyone else's favourite. It was good but a bit too spicy for me.

- steak wrap (5*): soooo good. I highly recommend it!! 

- mushroom soup (4*); different than your usual cream of mushroom. This is not creamy and has some spices that add a kick to it. 

-corn chowder (5*): excellent

I wish I lived closer because I would be coming here on a weekly basis especially during the winter time!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review after my second visit to Ravi Soup.  I went for a quick dinner on a Wednesday evening.  My previous visit was a couple of years ago during lunch on a weekday.  I remember the place being busy, but the service was prompt (although the food took a while), and the food was delicious.  

Fast forward to tonight.  Dinner time around Ravi must be a dead zone because it's night and day versus lunch time.  We walked in and there was nobody except two girls just finishing up their dinners and leaving.  Otherwise, it was completely empty.  After poking around a while, someone finally comes up from the basement to take our order.  Weird.

The place being empty gave us a chance to at least get a better look at the place.  It's not a sparking gem, but it's functional with a larger seating area at the back.  There's a counter at the front with stools.  In warmer weather, they open up the window in this area so that counter sitters can enjoy a nice breeze with their meal.  However, the counter itself wasn't exactly clean (not filthy, just not clean) and the stools were uncomfortable.

I ordered the pork shoulder wrap, and my companion had the organic chicken wrap.  We didn't co-ordinate and both ended up getting the mushroom soup.  I don't remember what I had a couple of years ago, but the lasting impression was that the food was delicious.  That hasn't changed.  My wrap was moist, delicious with a lot of flavours going on.  Definitely not a Mega Wraps style wrap.  The chicken wrap was also proclaimed to be fresh and tasty.  However, we both agreed that although the mushroom soup was very flavourful and deep, it was much too salty.  I wish we had gotten different soups so I could see if this is a problem for only the mushroom soup, or all soups.

I was a bit torn between 3 or 4 stars, but after mulling it over, I think 3 stars is more appropriate.  Yes, the food is delicious, but overseasoning is a sin of cooking.  And as at it's heart, Ravi is a soup and sandwich place, I don't necessarily care that their decor is virtually non-existent, but cleanliness and comfortable seating should be a basic even here.  It's too bad.  I really did want to rate this place higher."}
{"text":"Ravi Soups is really A-OK -- if you are in downtown and want a fresh, quick, unique meal, you won't go wrong with a wrap & soup combo from Ravi.

However... it's not all 5-star. The front entry & order counter area is definitely a bit grotty. It doesn't scream \"clean and fresh\" like I expected. Nonetheless, the staff are very attentive, friendly, and nice. You'll be happy with how you are treated, and get your food promptly -- who doesn't like that?

For the food? Had the lamb curry wrap and the apricot & lentil soup. 

The wrap was very good, but wow, the spice was hotter than I would have expected. I'm never one to shy away from spicy food. However, I do think that in this case, some of the more subtle flavoring gets lost in the spice, and that's a shame, because baby spinach, edamame, and more lurking in that wrap...

The soup -- similar issues. But in this case, it was that the soup was SO HOT. I got take out, walked the soup 2 blocks back to my hotel, set the soup on the desk for 15+ minutes, and it was STILL too hot! Must have been put in a nuclear reactor back at the shop... Once it cooled down, the flavors were wonderful. Portion (as I almost always think with soup) is silly big. I would have been OK with 1/3 of that little tureen...

Bottom line? Try Ravi Soups. They are nice and their food is cool!

Only reason I didn't give them 4-stars is that they kinda goofed my order, so it took 5 - 10 minutes longer that it normally would have. Also, was keen to try Burrito Bandidos as my other option, so a little bummed that I didn't get a steak burrito...   ;)

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is minutes from my work and I really enjoy the food here.  I usually get the Curried Lamb wrap with the Porchini Mushroom soup combo.  I have tried other items such as Corn Chowder, Chicken wrap, Pulled pork wrap, Beef Miso, and Ravi Stew and they are all very enjoyable.

So why only the 3 stars you may be asking.  Because it's damn expensive!  I know why others have rated this so high though as most of the people the go there are wealthy suits.  But for a small wrap (about 5 inches) and small soup (about a cup and half) it's $13-15!  If you want their full size wraps and soups it's $7.99-9.99 each.  Others may not know this but soup is not expensive!  It's suppose to be peasant food ffs.

I still come here because it's one of the few healthy options in the area.  So sad :("}
{"text":"Always great. Service is fast and no nonsense - everything is prepared fresh. Love the veggie wrap and the crab bisque. Today I tried the chicken hot pot soup and it was legitimately out of this world!!! 

Best lunch spot in the 'hood."}
{"text":"I had the free range chicken wrap and chicken salad combo. Everything I had was delicious. I loved the sauce on the wrap. The wrap was much larger than I expected. The side salad was the perfect size. I also sampled my husband's curried apricot soup and it was excellent."}
{"text":"Just moved in to the neighbourhood and tried this place for the first time.  So good!  Me and the hubby tried the Curried Apricot & Red Lentil and Porcini Mushroom & Wild Rice soups.  Delicious!  Looking forward to trying all the soups and the wraps that everyone are raving about.  Will be coming here often for sure."}
{"text":"The soup and wrap combo is a really good deal! Many delicious soups and wraps offered."}
{"text":"I have only had their vegetarian soups but I generally find them all spiced the same way which is too spicy for my taste."}
{"text":"Very excellent soup. It was like $10 though. I hear you can get the same stuff from Ravi for $4 at http://www.yelp.ca/biz/belljar-cafe-toronto"}
{"text":"This place has the most delicious wraps and soups. I always get the chicken wrap which has sweet potatoes in it as well. I highly recommend it. In terms of soups I have tried a couple: The corn soup was not very good but only because I'm not a fan of corn. The Butternut Squash soup was decent. My personal favourite was the tomato soup. Every soups is not served every day. I only give this. 4 instead of 5 because the inside of the place is humid and has thick air of soup smells which will leave the restaurant with you on you clothes, hair. etc. You definitely need a long shower after eating here. They leave the doors open in the summer, so it's not as bad."}
{"text":"Awesome soups and wraps!
Highly recommend stopping in for lunch!

This will be a regular lunch spot for us on our trips to Toronto!"}
{"text":"I went back and had the Ravistew. Very impressive. It didn't have the consistency of  a stew, which is, in my mind, a very good thing. Nonetheless, it was hearty and delicious."}
{"text":"As I type this, I'm quietly slurping and chomping my way through a wonderful soup and wrap combo from Ravi Soups. 

It's been ages since I've been here, but each take-out order I've had, I've NEVER been disappointed with. The soups are fantastic, and the wraps worth every bite!

Tonight, I polished off the roasted red pepper soup (SO GOOD) and I'm working my way through the curried lamb wrap - which, between the spice of the lamb, the sweetness of the mango and yam, and the mint, makes me wish I could have THIS good of a meal every day. 

It's been mentioned that this place isn't great for lunch. If you're like me and usually spend the dinner hour at work, I'd beg to differ. 

As some fellow Yelpers have mentioned, $10.99 IS a tad steep to pay for this meal ($12.62 total, tax included). But every once in a while never hurts."}
{"text":"Always amazing!
Slightly pricey, but very unique ingredients and fantastic service!
Makes for a great lunch. Order into the office many times.
Soups are unique as well.
I usually go with the lamp wrap."}
{"text":"So good. I like their lamb and flank steak wraps, but pork is pretty good too. Having tried others. Like curried soup the most. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and I have never been disappointed with the soup or wraps. The food actually is as good as remembered.
Be warned though some items are quite spicy but I like this.
As far as dessert goes, the cello wrapped banana cake / bread  was a bit soggy and I can't recommend it unless you are desperate for a banana bread fix which I thought I was at the time.
Expect to wait in line during peak times and also be warned that on a hot summer day, it will be very warm inside. The back out door patio is nice.
I do look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I have always been a soup fiend. I know it and everyone who knows me knows it. So when it comes to soups I have pretty high expectations. The other day was my first, but certainly not last time at Ravi Soups! 

Got some takeout for Vivek S. and myself while working a Yelp booth at an event this past weekend (I'm the intern). Upon his recommendation, I tried the corn chowder for the soup portion of my soup and wrap deal. It was so, so good. I usually am partial to chunky soups and that's part of what appealed to me when ordering chowder. This soup was smooth with a few kernals of corn and some small shredded pieces of crab meat but it was so complex in flavour that I did not mind in the slightest. The thai basil, the corn, the smoothness in texture with little corn and crab treasures, I'm missing that soup like it's an old friend. 

The wrap was equally good! When I took it out of the paper bag, I was worried. It looked small and I was ravenous. However in combination with the soup it turned out to all be the perfect portion of food for a very hungry girl. It was a curried lamb wrap with a pineapple chutney, sweet potato chunks and lettuce. Does that not sound like the best wrap ever? Even better, everything was cooked well so that it was nice and tender only to be complimented with crunch from the fresh lettuce leaf and tang of the pineapple. 

The space is really nice to look at with a vibrant orange and I would feel totally comfortable getting take out or sitting down for the meal at the restaurant. The staff were keen, noticing my first-timerness right away they were extremely helpful with their suggestions and patience. It seemed like it took a while for the food to come but for the quality, it's understandable. Have a glass of water from the cups and jugs they have out for you and relax!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I've been here twice and both times walked out stuffed and happy. The corn crab chowder is delicious, as is the Asian noodle soup (though it should be noted that it's still more of a traditional chicken soup than a pho, and doesn't come jam packed with noodles). The wraps are divine, and overall a very good deal for how much food you get. Strongly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm generally not a wrap person, but the Ravi ones are exceptionally tasty and pretty unique in their flavour combinations - the curry lamb and free range chicken are super filling so I usually end up taking home the soup when I get the combo. The stew is spicy in the best way. Outdoor patio is laid back and away from street noise. Service staff are on the ball."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the lentil soup, great flavours. However I found the lamb wrap too sweet. I am not a fan of sweet chutneys and didn't feel the flavours went together well."}
{"text":"I stayed in Toronto for a few weeks and this little gem was located across the street from where I was staying. I was curious because a lot of people raved about the soups. The restaurant is small but I was fine with that because it gave it a home feel. I felt like I was eating at my grandmas.

They have soups and wraps separate and they also have combos. I got a wrap and soup combo. The wrap was Flank steak and the soup was beef miso. I thought it was delicious. They added yams to the soup and wrap so it gave it a hint of sweetness. I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Oh my lord!!! Tried the curried lamb wrap...and it was divine!! Reasonably priced at under $10, the wrap was both filling and delicious. Check out the place folks... Worth it!"}
{"text":"Feeling under the weather due to a cold, I wanted some soup.  After doing some search I found out that Ravi soups is only 10 minutes away from my work, so I made the trek.

It. Was. Worth. It.

I had a soup & wrap combo.  Modestly priced at $10.99 it was worth every penny.  The soup (chicken broth) was a lot heartier than I expected, and packed a pleasant kick.  The quantity of fresh vegetables in the broth, and the flavour, more than made up for its \"lunch size\".  Moving on to the pork wrap, I was treated to another taste sensation.  The first bite, literally, opened up my taste buds.  And every bite thereafter was just as good as the first.

I went before the lunch rush (before 11:30) and the place was pretty much empty except for one of the staff lugging vegetables to the kitchen area.  The enclosed back area is very secluded and made a great place to read a book while eating my meal.  Presentation of the food was excellent: everything was placed on a miniature lazy susan, so it was easy to just \"spin\" each plate in front of me.

My only complaint was that the wrap was a little *too* juicy and I managed to get some all over my hands, but I feel that the juiciness goes to the freshness of the product.  All said it was worth the trek, and my cold seems to have run away from the spices in the soup.  I'll try out the takeout next time to see if it is as good when I get back to my office."}
{"text":"I really loved this place, the flavors were great and the food tasted gourmet and homemade. The food was warm and hearty, great when it is  winter. They have a menu of wraps and soups. The service was another great aspect of this place. I shared three combos with my family and it was the perfect meal. We ordered the steak, chicken and pork wraps, with corn chowder, mushroom soup, and chicken hot pot. Once again the flavors blended nicely and left me feeling satisfied. There are not many tables, so depending on when you get there you may or may not get a seat."}
{"text":"I hate soup and don't eat spicy but I love Ravi Wraps. 
Go for the steak flank wrap and the corn chowder."}
{"text":"One of the best wraps and soups I've ever had!  Ordered the sausage wrap which was super tasty.  However, the most tasty wrap they have is the curry lamb wrap combo-ed with porchini mushroom soup.  The curry lamb wrap was a combustion of flavors.  Fresh spinach, pumpkin, mango chutney with a heavy portion of curry lamb.  The porchini mushroom soup was ordered on a whim and Omg!  It's not your typical cream of mushroom.  It was a yummy broth with lots of mushroom bits.  Sooooooo good!!!!!!!!  

Honestly, my partner in crime and I dropped by this place unplanned and because we were hungry.  I'm so glad we did!

Venue is also spacious and comfortable.  Staff is friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Best soup in Toronto. Just go! My all time favourite has to be the Crab Corn Chowder & Free Range Chicken Wrap. It's all good."}
{"text":"I have been here many times. Best sandwich and soup place I have ever been too. The veggie wrap and chicken soup is outstanding. The service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Everything is so flavorful and thoughtfully prepared! Not your average wrap or soup, and very reasonably priced for the quality of the dishes served."}
{"text":"Ravi is a neighborhood favorite during lunch hour - the line up of comfort food seekers is to the door, but they move fast!

I ordered the soup and wrap combo - mushroom bisque and roasted free range chicken wrap. 

When mushroom soup is offered at any establishment, I ALWAYS order it. Unfortunately, the mushroom bisque at Ravi's wasn't as impressive as I expected. The taste of mushroom was overpowered by the amount of pepper used - the soup was more like a pepper soup with pieces of mushroom. There also wasn't the distinct taste of truffle oil. 

The wrap was A-OK because the skin was soggy and wet. It would have been delicious if the skin was grilled till it was nice and crispy, but sorry soggy skin is my biggest peeve when it comes to wraps. 

I didn't get a chance to enjoy their patio because all the seats were occupied, so I got take-out instead. I will return when I'm craving for some comfort food, and give their other options a try!"}
{"text":"Reasonable price for a delicious and filling soup. I brought a bunch of hungry musicians here from Texas one day and they were all extremely pleased. Comforting and perfect after a long night out."}
{"text":"Where do I began... these guys have taken the soup and sandwich combo and spiced it up to the next level! I typically never liked soup and sandwich because it is more like a cafeteria food but with these indian/middle eastern type flavours and ingredients you cannot go wrong. And shall I add that is extremely healthy and conducive to any clean eating diet. LOVE LOVE this place and be back at least once a week..

Thanks for doing this guys. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Contrary to the name, I'd recommend this place for the wraps much more than the soups. The veggie/mediterranean wrap is a great vegetarian option too."}
{"text":"I tried the curried lamb wrap and their mushroom bisque (wrap and soup combo = $12.49) today for lunch. The wrap was excellent. The lamb was tender and the curry sauce was flavourful with a nice level of heat. There was also spinach, sweet potatoes, and bits of pineapple in the wrap. The pineapple lent a pleasingly sweet flavour contrast to the curry.

The mushroom bisque (which is cream-free so that's excellent for people who can't handle a lot of dairy) was a tad bland. I tried it before I bit into the wrap and I thought, \"Ugh, needs a lot more seasoning,\" but then I started eating the wrap and it was okay to have something fairly bland to come back to between bites of the curried lamb. This soup would otherwise be far too bland for me to eat it on its own. Also, the soup was merely lukewarm rather than hot. I prefer my soup hot. 

I would give the wrap a five and the soup a three. Too bad it's not \"Ravi Wraps\" because they're just not living up to their name with the soup I tried today.

Tip: I don't know whether they have appropriate ventilation, but it is a tiny place and your clothing and hair will smell like curry, miso, and whatever else they're cooking. Even now, hours later, I still smell their cooking smells on my suit and in my hair. If you can come here in easy to wash attire (sweat suit, maybe), all the better to avoid the dry cleaning costs."}
{"text":"Good choice for any taste. Great lunch place!"}
{"text":"Damn solid meal. Had the lamb curry wrap and mushroom soup. Lamb curry wrap had some spice but nothing crazy. I'd probably get a different soup next time but the mushroom one was chalked full of mushrooms! Ill be back again next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"My go-to place if I want a nice bowl of soup. I don't believe in soups but this place brings soups to a different level. Great quality, affordable price ! I don't see it as an ordinary fast food place. I live nearby so it is my regular lunch place."}
{"text":"I was there today and ordered the corn chowder. I thought because it was a chowder I would be getting a hearty cream based soup, but it was completely the opposite. Maybe I made an unfair assumption based on t he word 'chowder' but the soup was not creamy at all, it was a yellow soup that had a lot of spice. I actually thought they'd given me the wrong soup until I checked photos online. 

The soup wasn't bad, but there was hardly anything in it besides the actual liquid. There was a very small amount of corn and blue crab. I was just very confused and felt like it wasn't what I'd ordered. If I knew that's what it was I wouldn't have gotten it."}
{"text":"By far one of the best restaurants in Toronto. Staff is fast & friendly, chefs are great, and the food is amazing. I have not been disappointed with any of the menu items.

The flank steak wrap is like a gourmet steak dinner wrapped up all in one.

Menu is very healthy, fresh, and unique. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I go to Ravi Soups about once a week for lunch because I work in the area.  I love this place.

My favorites among the soups are the corn chowder and the mushroom bisque.

From the wraps, I interchange between the curry lamb wrap which I tend to eat on colder and rainy days when i need a spice kick, and the flank steak wrap which is practically a regular item on their menu now... very yummy with the combination of yams, brie, spinach and the oh so good sauce that they use.

Go and you will be satisfied :)"}
{"text":"What a great little surprise. The soups are so tasty and fresh. If you need a perfect end to a day of eating and drinking, you should consider this very healthy spot.
Walking distance from our AirBnB in High Park.... highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a higher rating, but I had a MSG type hangover from the soup that I was not expecting from a place like this. 

First impressions when I came in were good enough. Clean and pleasant interior, and friendly service, though ordering was a bit weird as I had to walk down the stairs to the grill area and not the cash register to order. 

I had the corn chowder with blue crab and scone on the side. Both items hit the spot and were meticulously presented so I could accept the $8.99 price. Scone was buttery flaky and all around good. All was well when I left. 

But two hours later I started getting an allergic itching reaction on my body, I felt a bit dizzy and my mouth started feeling dry. Something in the meal didn't sit right, and I suspect it's the crab meat on the soup, which looked like it came out of a can or jar and laced with preservatives instead of being fresh. Without the hangover I would probably give the place a 4 but I can't give a good review to a place that made me sick!"}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of great things about this place! I ordered a chicken wrap which included: yams, spinach and caramelized onions! It was good but it wouldn't be something I would order again, the chicken had a slight after taste to it, so if you were someone picky with your chicken you might not finish it specially that it's a huge portion!"}
{"text":"To be perfectly honest, I've only had the mushroom soup. Mostly because it is the most delicious soup I have ever eaten. It's so rich and 'meaty' (with no meat-meat, just 'shroom meat) that I just can't help but order it everytime I go there.

It has been a while but the last few times I went, my soup came with a home made biscuit (aweeeeesome) with some sort of home made red pepper jelly (awesomely delicious).

There are now two convenient locations - one at Adelaide and John and another at Queen and Dovercourt. yumyumyum!

GO HERE. You will be drifted away to soupy goodness..."}
{"text":"Delicious soups and wraps. I recommend their Chicken Hot Pot Broth - it's my go-to soup when I'm feeling under the weather. Their scones and red pepper jelly are to die for."}
{"text":"I live near the Queen St location and just discovered the location downtown. Same amazing recipes with a nicer interior and faster service. Order to stay and they serve to your table on cool Lazy Susan plates.

A combo will set you back $12, which is well worth it compared to other expensive downtown fare."}
{"text":"These guys make the best chicken wrap. It's my absolute favourite from their menu and my four stars are just for that. I absolutely love the combination of chipotle spiced chicken with sweet potato, its this perfect blend of sweet and spicy. 
They also have a nice patio and dining area (its a long wooden table that everyone shares... pretty cool). 

I have tried their shrimp soup and found it to be too salty. Same with the mushroom soup but I'd still go back for the wrap."}
{"text":"Overall: 4.5 stars

Ambience:5/5 (clean and good enough for a takeout)
Food: 4.5/5
Service: 4/5 (for a primarily take out establishment, although we did eat there)
Value:4/5
Repeat: in a heartbeat

Note: Recommend (smaller sized) soup and wrap combo, which is plenty and yummy."}
{"text":"The soup I tried was okay --- mushroom and wild rice, but the wrap (pork shoulder) was just disgusting. The aioli was to sweet, the pork itself was dry, mealy and sort of gross. Not at all like REAL pulled pork as I've experienced it from Chipotle.

Overall, not a bad place to go.. for soups, I guess, but the wraps are less than awesome from what I've tasted so far.

To put it this way, I was starving and I didn't finish my wrap. I took 3 bites and threw it out.

I might go back and try the chowder just to be sure I really don't like this place, but I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"One of the worst lunches I have had for awhile. I got the mushroom soup and the chicken wrap. The wrap was bland and it tasted like the chicken had been boiled-gross. The soup was just really chunky and was also lacking flavour. I want my $14.00 back haha. I know the reviews say otherwise and maybe I just caught them on a bad day but with so many options in this city, I most likely will not be going back."}
{"text":"Tried the apricot soup. Very filling and amazing taste! Great portion for the price. Highly recommended. Will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Cool small little place with flavourful soups and wraps.  Some spicy asian flair. We tried pork shoulder and the lamb wraps, and for soups we tried the chicken hot pot and beef miso. Everything was delicious. The soup and wrap combo is a decent portion, if you don't have a ravenous appetite. Over great place and I'll visit again when I'm in the Panasonic Theatre area."}
{"text":"It was a rainy day in town, and I was seriously craving soup. I've heard great things about Ravi's, and since all the other places famous for soup (Soup Nutsy, etc.) were all closed, we decided to trek to Ravi's for a taste.

I, naively, thought that the soup and wrap combo came with a full side of soup. Had I known that the soup would be half size (duh...), I would've gone ahead and just ordered soup! The portion of soup I have was by no means filling enough, and I didn't feel wowed by the wrap.

I ordered their famous corn chowder and it was DEELISH. You could taste chunks of blue crab in it, and it was a perfect salty spicy mix. The roasted veggies wrap, on the other hand, was mediocre. The veggies were drowning in sauce, and all I could taste was the tomato chutney.

My friend ordered the curried apricot lentil soup, and the curried lamb wrap. I tried some of her soup. It was great! The sweet apricot cut through and acted as a great balance to the curry flavour. Didn't get to try her curried lamb wrap, but she said she thoroughly enjoyed it.

We both loved the soup, and agreed that next time, we'd order only the soup. The wraps weren't surprising, and the combos definitely not worth the premium. Trust us, order the soup, and you'll get better value for a cheaper price!"}
{"text":"Mmmmm... Yes please! 
Ravi Soups has tasty soups and wraps at a reasonable price. Wholesome, fresh, great recipes. Recommended."}
{"text":"The Ravi stew is realllly good and filling ! Good flavour and doesn't have too much soup and not enough chicken and veggies, it's like the perfect balance! The curied lamb wrap is also reallllly good and I love how it has mango in it !"}
{"text":"One of the best Sri Lankan eats in Toronto! Had high hopes for it walking in, and it didn't disappoint. Got the Lamb Wrap and Ravi Stew and both were delicious. The stew had the perfect blend of spices, can't wait to try the others!"}
{"text":"Save your money!
Terrible soups. Also, the staff seemed lazy. The soup seemed like it was made days before and warmed up. Very bland. No flavor. Dissatisfied customer."}
{"text":"I was sick and really wanted something to warm me up and this location on Charles had just opened up. I would suggest (if you can) call ahead because my only complaint is how long the soup takes to be ready. I figured they'd just have to scoop it, but I waited a good 15 minutes almost for my food that I was taking to-go. There wasn't even a line, I was literally one of two people in the establishment. Luckily, the soup was AMAZING. Worth the wait. I had the corn chowder. Warm and thick, with a bit of spice. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Curried Lamb Wrap - flavourful and not too spicy
Butternut Squash Soup - comes with cheese pastry + jam
All under $20 and enough to fill two!
Will be back to try more"}
{"text":"Feeling really sick, I needed a quick bite to eat 

Got the apricot and red lentil soup 

Made me feel soooooo much better!"}
{"text":"The wraps and soups here have a beautiful unique taste. I recommend the steak flank wrap and beef miso soup (but anything they make here is awesome). The portions are big and the price for the wrap & soup combo are good at approx. $12.
I would have given this place a solid 5 stars if it wasn't so busy at lunch time. There are times when customers are lined up outside to place an order. It's like hitting the lottery if you're able to get a seat."}
{"text":"Nice Place. Need more choices on bread. Only cheese biscuit not so healthy."}
{"text":"Ravi's always hits the spot. I was so glad to see this new location open up even further west than their Queen location.

I was fortunate enough to run into Ravi himself last weekend. I congratulated him thoroughly on his well-deserved expansion. He's a really great guy.

This location, alike the downtown one, has a great little patio to sit and sip wonderful soup. I always get the chicken hot pot and the free range chicken wrap combo. It's a sure thing. And for some reason, the soup was actually spicy at this location, unlike the others. I loved it!

Be sure to grab a glass of OJ to go with your meal. Squeezed while you wait, it's great!

Just a few blocks further west Ravi, and we'll be neighbours and I'll be sure to see you almost daily!

By the way, the debit card machine is now working."}
{"text":"This was pretty darn good.  The food was great, albeit a little unseasonal, but hey soup and sandwiches are their thing.  Service was good.  Food was prepared quickly and served well.  the store was clean."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious at a very fair price. 
I had the corn chowder soup and the roasted veggie wrap combo for $14. I kind of wish I had bought the butternut squash soup instead, but the chowder had good flavour. When it came to the veggie wrap... What a delight. Packed with healthy treats but then smothered in an incredibly flavourful chipotle mayo that brings a whopping mouthful of taste to the meal. I would love to eat here again."}
{"text":"Almost got chicken and I didn't realize it was in the soup and they stopped and suggested a few vegan soups and let me try them all which was very nice and even gave me a free water ! I had the squash soup and it was reallly good I just wanted to fall asleep after I was so happy:))) the price is a little expensive but I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times. The food is amazing. I get the grilled veggie wrap and a soup. Every soup I've had is delicious.    I've never been disappointed.  The service is great.  They are quick and friendly.  And it's a good deal too. Less than $20 to fill your belly and maybe even take some home for later.  I give 5 out of 5."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have had all the wraps and I believe it's one of the best places in Toronto based on flavor and value.  My personal favorite is the curied lamb wrap with spinach, mango chutney, and a pineapple salsa.  The tortia is crisped with butter on both sides (my favorite!). The lamb is spicy, intense, and buttery soft.  Quite a nice balance of a light sweetness of the pineapple salsa and mango chutney. I will note that the wrap is quite intense, so if our sensitive to spice, choose another wrap.  The roasted vegetable wrap with a pineapple salsa and chipotle mayo is also quite yummy.  
Another amazing things about these wraps are the value.  Great prices and great food! What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"So happy this cozy gem came to Yorkville. 

Why you should eat here: 
- Fresh ingredients and healthy options - dairy free options available
- They're opened late
- Good for dine in or take out

I'm slowly making my way through the menu and so far all the soups and wraps are delish! 

Some of my favourites: 

Ravi Salad ($4.99)- spinach, napa, mint, pineapple, mango cilantro, thai basil, crispy shallots lime, all toped with a refreshing chili aioli dressing.  I'm a big eater so I have this as a side salad but the portion is large enough to be a meal of its own. I order this every time. 

Ravistew - chicken, baby spinach, mushrooms, wild rice, edamame, cilantro, crispy shallots and root vegetables - A super hardy and slightly spicy soup. 

Curried Lamb Wrap - with roasted yams, baby spinach, brie and chipotle mayo. These wraps are generously filled and sauced appropriately.  The lamb curry wrap in particular is also a little spicy! Would love these wraps even more if there was a gluten free shell available. 

Soup and Wrap combo range between $9.99 - $12.99 (depends on the soup and wrap combination). Although the price runs a little steeper than the neighbouring soup and wrap options, the quality of the food is worth it. 

Eat here for a quick meal!"}
{"text":"I got the soup and wrap combo, I decided on the Ravistew and the free range chicken wrap.  The Ravistew is good but it was spicy for me as I didn't see where on the menu it hinted that it would be spicy.  The chicken wrap was very good, the meat isn't dry and the sauce is delicious.  It was stuffed as the portion is generous.  

The place is nicely decorated but the seating isn't that comfortable as there is one giant table in the middle with 2-3 smaller tables on the side.  They also have a lovely outdoor patio.  

I am looking forward to my next visit here to try other of their amazing soup and wrap.

{"text":"Soup was \"ok\", don't know what all the hype is about to be honest. We ordered two soups..Mushroom Bisque and RaviStew. Neither of the soups had wild rice in them ( as stated on the menu) and neither of them came with crispy shallots ( as per the menu). Best thing  about this place..their cheddar biscuits."}
{"text":"Soups are great, wraps are amazing and service is super friendly and fast (5min max). 
The combo is a great meal for a great price and you get a lot of food. The corn chowder is a beautiful soup, and you can ask them to try any soup that you're curious in. The biscuits that come with the soup are a perfect compliment and the pepper jam they're served with a great condiment. 
For fast food that tastes premium, this place is my favourite"}
{"text":"Soup and sandwiches/wraps, to me, are one of those combos that you can count as \"comfort food\" without the guilt. That's why Ravi Soups is a great option for a quick and satisfying lunch, the kind that won't keep you feeling sluggish for the rest of the afternoon. (It's also substantial enough to be a light dinner for some too!)

They keep it simple with their ingredients and focus on their ability to make their offerings taste good AND good for you.

I tried the soup + wrap combo - Wild Mushroom and Roasted Chicken wrap. I caved with the mushroom soup because it had truffle oil (and yes, I'm aware that's nothing close to the real deal, if at all, but I'm still a sucker for that aroma...). Heads up though! This isn't a cream-based mushroom soup so it's not going to be like the Campbell's soup you grew up with. It's rather light (water/broth-based) but still very tasty!

The Roasted Chicken wrap tastes a lot better than it looks too. They have these cubes of sweet potato that add a perfect touch of sweetness. My friend also ordered the Oven Roasted Vegetable wrap which looked just as, if not more, amazing too! And this is coming from a devoted carnivore...

All in all, Ravi Soups is a great stop to pick up some grab-and-go food for lunch or dinner. This location also has a neat little patio bar where you can enjoy your food and do some people-watching. It'll likely be my go-to place for comforting soups as the weather gets more chilly!"}
{"text":"Ravi soups has quite a few restaurant in the downtown area. The interior decor at the Adelaide location included a large wooden communal table in  middle and about 3 other tables around it that seated 2 or 4 people. They have soups and wraps, mainly, and their soup and wrap combo is around $9. Combo comes with half soup and a wrap. Wrap is quite big and the combo is definitely worth the price. I got the red lentil curry apricot soup. It was unique. Definitely gonna come back and try the entire menu!"}
{"text":"I love their corn chowder with blue crab soup so much that every time I go, I'm either craving the corn chowder or want to try another soup but can't help going back to corn chowder. It's about $9 for a soup or wrap or starts at $11.49 for a soup and wrap combo.

It's a relaxed atmosphere. You can dine in and they'll bring it to your table or you can do take out or delivery. No Ravi's that I've been to have chatty staff but they're all friendly. 

Gets busier when the weather gets colder."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Had the veggie wrap and porchini soup, both were truly amazing. Can't wait to get back to Toronto so I can visit them again"}
{"text":"First started going to Ravi Soups about 3 years ago and now I rarely make a month before I'm back again, craving the flank steak wrap and corn chowder combo.

I've rated this location as it's the spot of my first visit but have found their food quite consistent in quality at their other locations.

A little bit pricey, but well justified IMO.  They know they have a good product ;)"}
{"text":"Walking by you would probably miss it, but well worth the time to stop in. Interesting, hearty menu options, changes daily. Soups are awesome , all homemade and wraps are large with lots of filling. Go hungry....
Miso soup was fantastic with a different twist on flavor.
Great place with outdoor dining in the back."}
{"text":"On a whim we stumbled in here on Saturday evening. After a night of drinking for a friend's birthday - we were starving and so we decided to give this a try. 

I had the curried lamb wrap which was surprisingly spicy, so spicy my fiancé had to finish it for me while I ate the side salad. I'm \"ok\" with spicy food, I regularly eat Buffalo wings and I enjoy adding chilli oil to my noodles, but this had a strong kick to it. The lamb wrap came with squash and a mango salsa, in theory, a good combination. 

The lamb itself was tender, but the taste was not my cup of tea. It was a cheap eat, the service was quick and the place was clean, but I don't think I'd wander over again any time soon. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good..."}
{"text":"I thought I'd treat myself to a semi-expensive lunch today and for me, anything above $7 (for lunch) is considered splurging. I sprung for the porcini mushroom brisque with wild rice, shallots and truffle oil. My knowledge of fine dining is next to zero so the term \"brisque\" conjured up some fancy lobster but thankfully, this soup was vegetarian-friendly.
At $8.99 ($10.16 with tax), I'm a little iffy about whether soup merits that price tag but it was surprisingly filling. A bit on the peppery side but very savoury. It came with a small flaky and very buttery biscuit and a tiny container of sweet pepper jelly. 
Not sure if I'll return because I normally bring my lunch to work but if I forget my lunch again and  feel like treating myself to some fine-dining soup, I will."}
{"text":"wow! the wraps are hearty and healthy. i had the veggie wrap with sweet potato and brie, and nibbled on my friend's lamb wrap which was even better! she might have eaten the whole thing, had she not been on a friday night date... with 7 other people. 

actually, her date recommended this \"sandwich and soup\" joint. to which i made clear, i would base all my impressions of him on this one. 
let's just say he made it into the good books and she's still dating him :) 

minus one because: 
there was only one friendly guy working in the front and the back, resulting in slow - yet substantially satisfying - service.
the ravi-slaw was described on the blackboard with such potential lacked ommph (perhaps a bit more vinegar would have helped?).

notes:
- lamb was \"spicy\", as in well-seasoned with heat for those in the group for whom i trust their taste-buds. it was \"too hot to finish\" for those who might find \"spicy\" at Moxie's to be \"just right\".
- drink choices are mostly uninspired bottled sugar drinks that could be improved."}
{"text":"Butternut squash soup. Whatever you are picturing in your mind, it's better. I actually dreamt about it last week. The chicken wrap, soup and scone is one of the meals I would orders for a last meal before my execution.  It's always busy but not too busy that you want to walk out.  Take out or eat in - Equally as good."}
{"text":"I walked in at a bit of odd hour to this establishment as the place next door was gonna be open later. The place was completely empty and not even the server or cook could be located. 
After a bit of friendly knocks and shouts anyone home somebody showed up from downstairs. 
The Soup and wrap combo caught my eye as I wanted try both the namesake soups and a wrap.
I decided to go with the apricot and lentil soup and a seafood wrap with Lobster and Crab meat. I waited for my food and decided to eat in.
There is a large communal table in the center and a few tables in the main dinning area. There is a patio in the back as well but it was too hot for me to sit out.
The food arrived promptly and was served on a nice round wooden disc (lazy susan) that swivels (though I couldn't stop it from swivelling when I ate) Presentation was OK. I decided to try the soup first. it was topped with a bit of cream and some caramelized onions which I appreciated. The soup was mellow for my taste but good nonetheless. 
Now for the wrap it wasn't much to write home about. Lots of veggies and some bits of seafood. The yams added a sweet finish which I appreciated. 
So the final verdict is 3.5 stars. I am not a lunch person but this is a decent option if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I got the roasted free range chicken (mild) and butternut squash soup

Soup wad really nice and served hot and quite a bit of Spicy pepper which was nice just beware if you think there's no heat

Wrap was good had lots of meat in it not salty but sweet potato was a surprise a bit to sweet and kinda clashed with the soup would have preferred cheese(sweet potato is healthier though) the spinach was nicely balanced and sauce was amazing. Just to sweet because of the sweet potato. Not too bad though."}
{"text":"Delicious soups and wraps here. It's their specialty. Very affordable deals as well. Service is fast and friendly. This location is very accessible by ttc right along queen w. Selection is somewhat limited but everything they do, mainly wraps and soups, is amazing and has great flavour."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it's very good.  I would give it five stars but it's just a bit expensive for the portion sizes (a large bowl of soup really shouldn't cost almost 10 bucks).  The soup and wrap combo (smaller versions of the regular a la carte choices) is $12 and change so it's still within reason.  The corn and crab chowder is delicious, as is the curried lamb wrap.  The red pepper bisque was alright, but I'd go have the corn soup again for sure."}
{"text":"Decent place for a cup of soup. Came here a few weeks ago for a quick dinner. Had a spicy miso beef with lemongrass. Was quite nice. Came with a piece of brown bread as well."}
{"text":"Ravisoups never disappoints. I visited again recently and the \"combo\" of the special soup (it was butternut squash & pear, or something like that), and the free range chicken wrap with cranberry & greens, was just the perfect amount of fresh, chef-prepared goodness. So no, I generally don't think soup is a meal, at least not butternut squash soup. Thank heavens for Ravi's perfect combo.

Since it's a cold city for nearly half the year, I really think they should ditch the metal tables and chairs for something warmer."}
{"text":"I usually write my reviews after the meal but it's so good I have to write it while having the meal.

Love this place and had every wrap except for veggie wrap. Who the heck eats that? Bunnies?

#1 Steak with Brie Cheese wrap. the combination of cheese and steak cooked to perfection. So delicious. Get ready to get addicted!
#2 Lamb wrap is a close second, it has mangoes in it! Crazy and delicious.
#3 Pulled Pork - this is pretty good but the pork was a little dry. This is not bad but not amazing like the steak and the lamb.
#4 Chicken - The chicken was flaky and had the same texture as the Pulled Pork but not as flavourful.

Overall they are all good and this is the spot I am bragging to everyone about. Soups are really good as well."}
{"text":"Nothing I write in here can truly do Ravi Soups justice. Now to be clear, we are not talking about one of the top restaurants in the city overall but for what it is its surely top of its class. If you are looking for a solid lunch (soup + sandwich) you really cant beat it. Been here many times and everything there is great, you truly cant go wrong.

Perfect lunch time spot at reasonable enough prices these days."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and I always get the Curried Lamb wrap. It's prepared with sweet potato, pineapple, edamame, spinach, with a spicy kick - $11.29 for a full wrap. My go-to soup is the curried apricot and red lentil soup, comes with a cheddar biscuit and pepper jelly. It's perfect for those cold winter months. If you want to try a bit of both you can choose the combo - wrap and soup starting from $10.99. Great spot to grab a bite before hitting up the Scotiabank theatre."}
{"text":"A healthy choice for a filling meal. 

I've been here twice - and both times walked out full. The soup and wrap combo is the best - you can pick from a variety of wraps and soups, and they are both a good quantity. If you go for the more expensive meats (aka steak), expect the bill to be about $15 - which is a bit pricey for a \"fast food style\" restaurant, but the quality of the food justifies it. 

Their wraps are extremely healthy with tons of vegetables and a good amount of meat. The soups are unique and tasty as well - they range from mild to spicy. 

Overall, this is a great restaurant to dine at. I would suggest eating your meal there, so it doesn't get cold by the time you get home. More often than not, you will have to pack some of your food to go since it is quite filling."}
{"text":"Finally got to the Queen West Ravi last Thursday after too long. It was appropriately cool & rainy - the perfect day for soup! The Roasted Apricot & Red Lentil soup was superb! Creamy, chewy, warming - mmm! Topped off with a small cheese ciabatta, it was near perfection - and Glory Hole donuts lay kitty-corner to complete my lunch! Huzzah!"}
{"text":"We had our team lunch here one Friday. We arrived at 11:45 and it was busy but not packed.

I had the Porcini Mushroom Soup Wild Rice Bisque
with crispy shallots & truffle oil. It came with a cheese biscuit. It was good but I thought it was too much of one thing. I wish I just ordered the combo soup and wrap. 

My colleague ordered the corn chowder with blue crab meat and he said it was good.  He also mentioned though that he should have ordered the combo. My other colleague had the beef soup and wish he ordered the combo as well. The  biscuit was okay, nothing spectacular. 

If you want variety, I suggest you get the combo. If you love soups,  then get the big soup bowl which comes with a biscuit."}
{"text":"Just stopped in since i heard from friends it was good. This place is the epidomy of the excellent food you can find in Toronto by small shops... bursting flavour, creative dishes, and fantastic value. I've paid more for substandard chain sandwiches that i loathed even considering.

I ordered the curried-lamb wrap (their menu online says beef, but it was lamb yesterday) as well as the Chicken Hot Pot soup (lemongrass/lime leaf/coconut milk) and Corn and Blue Crap soup... all were excellent.

Surprisingly highly recommended as well since I'm not the biggest salad fan is their Slaw - there's so much flavour combined with their own crispy onions that i wish i had gotten more.

A wrap/soup combo plus a single soup and the slaw was more than sufficient for two people for dinner."}
{"text":"I feel there are not enough good soup restaurants out there and this one really knocked it out of the park. I had the lentil and apricot curry soup, partly because I was intrigued with the combination, and it was super tasty and flavorable. I ordered the 1/2 and 1/2 so for the wrap I decided on the curry pork and it blew my mind. I didn't expect the wrap to really be that delicious and I loved how it was pressed like a panini. I also asked for a piece of bread as I saw it coming straight out of the oven and, as amazing as everything else was, I think the bread alone would have made me a very happy customer!"}
{"text":"I had the porcini mushroom wild rice soup with truffle oil ($10), which came with a cheddar biscuit and a little pocket of sauce on the side. The soup was perfectly fine (I think truffle oil will be one of those acquired taste kinds of items for me) and included a generous portion. 

The biscuit was delectable! You must try it if you're generally a biscuit fan."}
{"text":"After wanting to try Ravi soups out for months it did not disappoint. The curried lentil and apricot soup was the clear winner of everything we tried. We also tried the veggie wrap, pork wrap, and corn bisque."}
{"text":"Really good wraps and soup, nice little restaurant off the beaten path. It is perfect for lunch and also serve beers."}
{"text":"The soups were very flavourful and filled with all sorts of ingredients. The wraps were good but not as much as the soups which I would rate 5 stars. The combo with a wrap is a pretty good deal though. 
Overall very good place"}
{"text":"Wow. 
The Curried Lamb Wrap is the BEST wrap i've ever had. Honestly. 
Flavorful, hearty, juicy...and the mango-pineapple salsa is so fresh and goes fantastically with the curried lamb. 

The porcini mushroom wild rice bisque was delish with the essence of truffle. 

I have to admit, when i first saw Ravi Soups on Yelp, i was wigged out by the name. Thought it was just another Indian restaurant. Also...it's more than a soup deli...the main draw for me were the wraps. 

Couple of things that took it down 1*:

- The girl working there was...not trained well. 
Childish and immature to both customers and the cooks. She made me stand there for quite a few mins while she 'did her chores' of separating the forks, AFTER the cook/ owner asked her to help me out and answer the phone when it was ringing. She insisted on finishing up her work before turning around to ask me if i wanted to order something. Ummm, DUH, i want to order something. Did you think i just stood there to check out the menu and walk away?

- The wrap and soup combo, although amazing, was $12.40. It's not something I can indulge in every day for a take-out lunch or even more than 2x a week. Wish it was more affordable"}
{"text":"Our fearless CM's review inspired me to check out Ravi.  Gosh dang it, I sure am glad I did!!  Shoop, shoop!!

I had the soup and wrap combo.  Red pepper bisque (one of my fav types of soups) with a flank steak wrap.  Perfect portions.  Its like the best of both worlds - a little soup with a little wrap.  Great lunch size.

The bisque had shrimp in it and was perfect in texture and flavour.  The wrap was so good and I did share that bit of news when I first pti into it (I believe with my mouth open) to Avitania B, Danielle P and Chris P.  It was OMG worthy.

This place is open till 10 pm on Friday nights and does take debit.
Is the soup as good as Soup Nutsy....not quite - but Soup Nutsy isn't open at night so a gal's gotta do what a girls gotta do.

I got mine to go, but the large communal table inside is pretty snazzy and the odd horse at the front of the shop...odd....but I'll roll with it.

Highly recommend.  Whether you have the sniffles or just fancy a bit o soup."}
{"text":"The ravislaw rocks and I also had the free range chicken wrap which was out of this world."}
{"text":"I like it. They've got wraps, and they've got soups. Order them both as a combo and you save several couple dollars (though the soup is a bit smaller than the stand-alone offering).

Wrap is flavorful, soups are hearty. The lamb wraps and chicken wraps were satisfying; not too small, but not too big.

The Ravi Stew is just stuffed full of vegetables and chicken; very nice.
Chicken hot pot soup was also really good."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch today and expected to be blown away from the reviews here on Yelp. I have to say, I was a bit disappointed - while the food was alright, I didn't think it was spectacular.

Since it was such a nice day, we had our lunch on their patio at the back. It's a cool space with tons of plant life and a gorgeous mural on one of the walls. The food is brought out to you on an individual sized lazy susan and the wait staff are pretty nice.

I had the Corn Chowder and Curried Lamb Wrap combo. The corn chowder was alright - while the soup tasted as though it was made from scratch, I was expecting more of a \"fresh\" corn flavour though, if that makes sense. The crab in the soup seemed to have a bit of a fishy flavour and wasn't as sweet as I hoped it would be. The wrap was the better choice of the two - there was a nice toast on it and the ingredients inside were also very fresh! The only thing about it that I didn't like was that the spice on the curry was a bit too overwhelming for me - I can't handle very spicy foods. For that reason, I wish there was a bit more mango-pineappe salsa to cut the heat. 

My lunch partner had the Roasted Red Pepper Bisque with the Flank Steak Wrap (sorry I can't remember what exactly it's called!). He loved his soup (I agree with him, it has a very nice, rich flavour to it) and the little bits of shrimp inside there were perfectly cooked. We both liked my wrap more of the two though because there was some funny tasting sauce on the Flank Steak that we thought was a bit overwhelming. Both soups also had Thai Basil on them I think, and I liked that special little touch! The herbs were fresh and bright tasting and made things a bit more interesting.

Our lunch came to a total of $24.84, which wasn't too bad for food that you're getting downtown I guess. I wasn't blown away, but all in all, it was pretty decent - better than anything you'd get on the PATH at least! It's a lunch place worth trying, but don't expect it to perform miracles.

EDIT: Ahhh okay. So after trying some other stuff to eat downtown, I realized that my expectations for Ravi Soup might have been a little bit inflated - compared to the other stuff available, it's probably considered really good food. Thus, I am bumping this review up to 3.5 stars! The soups all contain a variety of textures for contrast and also contain many more complex layers of flavour than at some other places (say for example, the hand-held and sippable soup cups Petit Four).  So while it's a little better in my books, it still isn't the best."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious.  

The lamb wrap and the crab chowder are my favourite by far!  The staff is always super friendly and greet you with a big smile when you walk in.  Between the food and the staff - its one of the most comforting places to go when you're having a rough day."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place.
The lamb curry wrap is kind of to die for.  The lamb is just sooooo succulent and so tasty.  I usually get angry at the filling to wrap (or bun if it is a sandwich) ratio and generally find there to be not enough filling when I eat out.  This place dpes NOT make that mistake.  the wrap is a masterful prototype of grilled soft roti-type yummy that is just strong enough to hold all that filling in but not in your way.

In the soup department I have tried the Mushroom (my favourite!!---so incredibly delicious), ravi's stew- which comes with a generous portion of chicken and other vegetables, and the butter nut squash.  
To be honest... the other soups are good but... mushroom will always be the best and I always kick myself for not ordering the mushroom after I decided that I would be adventurous and try something else.

The cheese biscuit is kind of the star performer here.  It is buttery and delicious.  I, myself, make a pretty damn good cheese biscuit/scone- but here..it's so flakey and..just perfect.  So good that I have come on several occassions with my signif other and they have ordered a full meal and I just order me a delicious cheese biscuit.  at 1.50$ each (I think they might have been cheaper a year ago before it became WAY popular)- they are still a steal.

The communal tables are kind of the best thing in the world as I have made some fun lunch buddies along my ravi-soups adventures.
And the staff are oh so kind to bring your meal out directly to you on a pretty legit lazy susan.

I don't come here often, but when I have a craving for soup this is the FIRST place I think of.  I don't mind spending the 10$ for a bowl of deliciousness, even when I could just warm up some \"gourmet\" store bought soup much more easily.  There is something about the love and care I can see that is put into this place that I really appreciate.

WIN."}
{"text":"GIANT BLACK HAIR 

I ordered the chicken wrap around noon on Wednesday last week, I requested it be served in a bowl rather than in the wrap as I intended to save it for my evening meal. I was taking a ViaRail out of Toronto and wanted something healthy for the trip. That evening, I began to eat it was not 2 bites in before I found a thick hideous long black hair embedded in the chicken.

Needless to say I couldn't continue to eat it and will NEVER be back. 

I have tried to email, tweet and Facebook this business and no one has replied to me. So perhaps this is a common occurrence and does not warrant a reply or refund."}
{"text":"First time at this location. Tastes exactly the same
Curried lamb wrap and chicken hot broth soup. Really tasty....wish we had a location close to home.

Service was quick. Nice decor.
Yummy food."}
{"text":"Great spot for all you soup and wrap/rotti lovers try this fusion spot which will leave you drooling for more.

Loved the dhal soup and the mutton wrap!
Sheap, cool little place. Most importantly very tasty :))"}
{"text":"The soups and wraps here are amazing! I hate myself for only discovering Ravi's Soups only weeks ago. I've been neglecting myself. I've probably tried almost everything on their menu and from what I tasted was fantastic. The staff here who I believe is family owned and operated are super friendly. I've taken a couple friends here and now their also hooked on the goodness."}
{"text":"Great soups, favourite is the corn and crab chowder. All their soups are great, you should try them all. The wrap+soup combo is a great meal as well. Cheese biscuit not my thing, but everyone seems to love them. They have a beautiful dining table for communal dining that's a sight to behold.

Wish they had new soup recipes..."}
{"text":"Good:
* Everything is tasty, but no woow factor.
* The decor is very nice, cottage-style wooden table inside and backyard patio.
Bad:
* Portions are not that big, I would have expected to be full after paying $12 for a combo;
* Gets a bit crowded inside at noon and very noisy. Instead of the waitresses yelling your number and searching for you to bring the plate, they could have given you a label to put it on the table while you wait."}
{"text":"I was eating the curried apricot and lentil soup, and it was so good that I had no choice but to leave a great review. It was SO delicious, just the right amount of spice and so many amazing flavours. I love this place. Every time I eat here I get upset myself for not eating Ravi Soups more often!"}
{"text":"I was eating a roasted vegetable wrap from Ravi Soup, but it was so delicious that I stopped what I was doing to tell you how good it is."}
{"text":"I WISH THEY HAD A LOCATION CLOSER TO ME! 

A friend and I had the pleasure of eating here in the summer. I've heard amazing things about the legendary Ravi's Soups and had to have a taste.

The soups are rich and full of flavour. This is important because I love soup and it's so hard to find a soup that is rich and full of flavour. I literally ate every last drop. My sandwich was amazing and it was full as well. I had a wrap that fell apart because that's how full it was! Ravi gives you your money's worth!

It's a bit pricey, but I got a soup sandwich combo which was more than enough to fill me up. 

We ate on the patio and it was so cute and intimate. This is a great place to have lunch, grab lunch and go, or just spend an afternoon with friends. I love the oak table in the middle of the bistro."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place.  It sounds amazing, and I do love soup...but as it was, it was just good.  I got the wrap and soup combo so that I could try more things, and chose the corn chowder with blue crab and the chicken wrap.  I'll admit I was very impressed to see a guy in the kitchen cutting the corn off the cobs - no faking it here, clearly.  I was also impressed with the amount of crab in my soup when it arrived.  The soup was definitely the better of the two, it was quite tasty, but didn't blow me away - it wasn't a $9 soup in my opinion.  I wasn't a huge fan of the chicken wrap either.  Part of that might be my personal tastes, but I didn't find that the flavours melded well together.  I also found the chicken to be a little dry.  I liked that they served it on a lazy susan though, that's a cute idea.

All in all, good soup but not amazing, might go again if I was in the area and try something else."}
{"text":"Must have Ravi roasted red pepper bisque and the grilled veggie wrap.  The soup is always good no question about it.  The wrap was a perfect blend of fresh spinach with grilled warm veggies and grilled perfectly.  I wish we had a Ravi's in Oakville or Mississauga.  I would eat there every night!!!

The space is small but it has this gorgeous wooden table that is so long and wide that it works well for twosomes to sit side by side and still enjoy some privacy."}
{"text":"A very good four star rating, interesting mixtures of tastes (indian, mexican). I recommend the soups and for sure the wraps."}
{"text":"I'm in love with Ravi stew. Chock full of veggies and chicken and great flavor. Not from Toronto but I now go here whenever I'm in town for the stew. The flaky cheesy biscuit you get with the stew is like icing on a perfect cake. If you love soups or stews and great flavor, this is it. 

On top of this, their credit card machine was down but they said fine to come back later today or tomorrow to pay (honor system... Who does that anymore?!). Good people with great food."}
{"text":"Delicious, quick, homey, comforting. Ravi soups on queen w has made me feel at home in a new city, especially while under the weather. Their hearty concoctions are incredibly flavorful and filling on their own, but the added biscuits with red pepper jelly just rounds out the experience perfectly."}
{"text":"I had always wanted to visit Ravi Soups but my previous attempts were all hindered with me visiting outside of business hours. But I've managed to come in here a few times recently and each time I get served up amazing food!

Their soup and wrap combo is a match made in heaven for someone that's hungry, loves both and can't decide what to have. 

I do wish they had more veggie wrap options so I don't always have to get their grilled veggie wrap which is not a bad thing since it too is delicious.
I don't have much experience with mainly soup serving locations, but this place is the perfect place to lunch for me. It's not too expensive especially for what you get in return and it's never been too busy on my visits which is a far cry from next doors Khao San Road. 

They have a good sized shade filled patio which is great on a summer day. While I do wish they had more drink options and a slightly more varied food menu, what they do have is amazing and it's highly unlikely you will leave disappointed after a trip here.

On my last trip though they did send me a chicken wrap when I asked for the veggie on. If I were a strict vegetarian that would have definitely spoiled my day when biting in to it."}
{"text":"First time at this new location, but second time visiting a Ravi Soups.

This location held up to my memory of the other location. This one is of course smaller, with limited seating, however, it has the same quick and efficient service. Love the soup and sandwich combos. They are healthy and tasty and so beyond reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I've tried everything on the menu and the lamb wrap is my favorite. They fill your grilled wrap to the brim with flavorful, tender meat and they usually put mango chutney and edamame in it. Service is really quick and the staff is super friendly. I can easily grab a wrap on my way home or dine in as there is plenty of seating."}
{"text":"The food at Ravi Soups makes for a quick and moderately priced lunch.  As the name suggests, their menu includes a selection of soups.  Both tasty and unique, each soup is very good indeed.  The portions are a little small however, and it is somewhat on the expensive side.  The quality and freshness of the ingredients is apparent, and certainly justifies the price tag.  

It is their wraps however that really make the place worth visiting.  The lamb wrap, is exceptional.  Without doubt some of the best curried lamb I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy.  The addition of pineapple really helps balance out the flavor. 

All in, this provides a great place for lunch or dinner, the price point is a little high though."}
{"text":"I wish I lived next to this place, because I will never get tired of it. 
The soups are delicious! And it's not the boring old chicken noodle, cream of X or Y. 
My favourite = Corn Chowder (with blue crab, thai basil) 
It's unlike any other corn chowder in the best way possible! 

And their wraps - not the greatest in the city, but pretty darn good. A soup and wrap combo is about $10, and very filling!

Oh and the communal live edge table at the Adelaide location is fantastic! Nothing better than sitting around a tree with strangers and warming up with some delicious soup!"}
{"text":"This place is straight up awesome and serves pretty much the best soup I have had just about anywhere. 

It can be hard to decide between the soups and the wraps. So, why not get both as a combo. 

The only downside to getting a combo is that when you get a regular soup on its own, it is served with a delicious biscuit with red pepper jelly. Decisions, decisions.

While all of the soups are good, I am a huge fan of the red pepper bisque. Just phenomenal."}
{"text":"So I came here with a friend of mine to try out their soup because of all the hype and I ordered a small Ravi stew for about $9 tax in that came with a scone and sweet and sour sauce. 

What I liked: 
-Everything appeared to be made from scratch
-The soup had plenty of meat and vegetables in it.  

What I didn't like:
-The price.  The food cost on that soup is probably about less than $1.50, so that's a huge markup.  I would expect the maximum price to be $5.99 for a small stew.  At the same time, my friend got a wrap and soup combo for like $10-$11 plus tax, which isn't bad, but I still think it's pricey for a \"combo\" when you are supposed to get a discount.

Verdict: If you can make your own soup, then this place isn't worth it.  I admit it is good, but I just can't justify the price. Sorry."}
{"text":"Such a reliable spot for lunch or dinner, and very friendly staff. They have the best and most interesting wraps I've tried, and friends say the soups are to die for. Can't believe I haven't had one yet! The chicken salad was full of fresh ingredients, just enough to really fill you up. I love the steak wrap, with the mix of spinach and sweet potato, all the flavours blend seamlessly. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Very good tasting, but cramped and kind of expensive.

The long table is good to sit at if there's room (after standing for a very long time in line, waiting to order).

Recommend the Veggie Wrap, and any of the soups.

Note that with the combo you get much smaller versions of the individual options (something that wasn't clear at first)."}
{"text":"It's a bit pricey, but fair for lunch. But you get large portions and the soups ARE really good. 

I got the truffle oil and porcini mushroom bisque. It was a bit salty, but nice fresh ingredients and tasty.  It comes with a cheddar cheese scone/biscuit and some vinegar? i'm not sure what that was. 

Quick and tasty."}
{"text":"Checked this place out based on the Yelp ratings. Was totally worth it. Got the Curried Lamb wrap for $8.99, which had in it: lamb, baby spinach, yams, pineapple, mango, lime chili and mint cilantro. Was a little on the spicy side and could have used some more meat but other than that very mouth watering good! Friendly service as well. Left feeling satisfied. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Woooooowwww so good! Here's what we ordered:
1) lamb burger - 4/5 (super fresh, very healthy tasting)
2) corn chowder - 4.5/5 (delicious, could use a little more crab, fantastic flavour and I love the pineapple on the side)
3) lamb wrap - 5/5 (unbelievably tasty)
4) chicken hot pot - 4.5/5 (light, many flavours, excellent)

What else:
-they have beer! Wicked
-unique seating arrangement, like you're at a kid camp, but good
-fresh ground pepper on the table and hot sauce if you ask for it 

Can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"Who goes out for soup anyway? Everyone in Toronto, I have learned. I am still astounded to see the reach of the Ravi Soups chain across this great big town.

This Queen West location is the only one I've tried, and it's top-notch. I am now a person who goes out for soup. I've tried a couple of kinds at Ravi, as well as their wrap-soup combo, but my go-to is the Chicken Hot Pot Broth. It's got a ton of chicken in a yumsville coconut broth, with just a few noodles (not killer on the carbs), bok choy, slices of mango, mint, ginger, and a few edamame. Soups come with a delicious cheese biscuit and a small dish of red dipping sauce with a sweet and slightly spicy taste.

The soup is delivered on your own personal wooden lazy Susan, which is a fun novelty. You can spin back and forth between your soup and your scone.

Best of all, at Ravi they don't just ladle your soup out of some big vat - things are made to order here, so soup veggies are fresh and meats (the miso steak soup) have a bit of the grill to them. The soup comes out fairly quick and is steaming hot.

Despite the quasi fast food look of the place, this is a great spot for a healthy, filling, consistent, and inexpensive lunch."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Fast, inexpensive and just fantastic.  I got the soup and wrap combo:  Porcini Mushroom wild rice bisque and the roasted chicken wrap.  I had to be back at work and only had 30 minutes and didn't know what this place was like but they were literally 5 minutes to have my order ready and everything was perfect.  Had a nice sit in the back patio, enjoyed my meal and still made it to work on time.  I didn't realize how amazing this place was to Yelpers prior to coming.  I was originally looking for a pita and on the way to the Pita Pit, I saw this place.
The wrap was just fantastic!  The chutney inside was amazing and there was something in the mayo that was also delicious.  I feel like they could have added a bit of spice to it (the chutney was a super mild) but size was good and overall I was happy.  The soup was a tad saltier than I would have liked and just on top of the soup I could see a little bit of grease bubbles.  BUT, it was yummy none the less.  Main reason I only gave a 4/5 was because I was hoping that with the word Soup in the places name, I expected this to be the all star of the food I bought.  The salty part of the soup for me wasn't even that big of an issue but the grease in the soup..... After I ate the soup I could rub my lips together and they would slide.  Yes, it was that greasy.  Great taste but in my opinion, they need to back off the oil a bit.
I will still be back here but next time I want to try the Ravistew."}
{"text":"i love me some soup!  i can always have a good bowl of it...and this place is definitely the place to get it!  i woulda gave it a 5 stars but i did find that the soups were salty...flavourful...but salty.   we got the soup and wrap combo each...both wraps were great - chicken wrap and curry lamb!  mushroom soup was amazing!  so fresh and could really taste the mushrooms.  perfect portion size for lunch...but not for dinner...but then again, can always go get dessert!  hopefully they can reduce the salt as with all the flavour from the ingredients...they can!"}
{"text":"Love love love ravis. Soup selection needs a revamp but omg delicious. Salty as the sea  but super tasty otherwise. Wraps are the outstanding part. Again would be nice if they added seasonal soups or wraps, but hey, I guess if it ain't broke don't fix it. Their food is the right price, very very affordable, especially for the high quality of the fresh ingredients. Try the beef wrap, the miso soup and leave a tip, they work hard!"}
{"text":"Just tried Ravi soups today for lunch. What a quaint location! It looks small when you walk in but there's an entire back section that you can sit in. They also seem to have an outside back patio, obviously not for chilly days like this.

My friend and I both got the soup and wrap combo. I had ordered the curried lamb wrap and the porcini mushroom soup. The wraps got mixed up and I realized too late that I had my friend's roasted vegetable wrap - but by golly, what a fantastic wrap! It was amazing. It was a perfect blend of yams, spinach, brie...etc and it wasn't bland or too salty. Two thumbs up!

The mushroom soup was great as well. I loved the crispy shallots - made all the difference. I also appreciated the wild rice. Really lovely soup."}
{"text":"Yay!  This place is awesome.  My fave thing to order is their flank steak wrap and mushroom soup.  Ingredients are fresh, portions are good and food is always freshly made.  Haven't been regularly as I'm no longer downtown much, but please please please open up at Yonge and Eglinton!"}
{"text":"I regularly visit here for my lunch break during weekdays, and this place consistently delivers fresh, affordable, delicious food in an area that is full of overpriced and underwhelming restaurants. The decor is warm, with an open kitchen, wood furniture and eccentric art. I recommend coming early since the place gets packed for lunch, and that alone is an indicator of popular this place is. Having tried every dish on the menu, my favourite is the corn chowder and the Ravi stew, both hearty and bursting with flavour. There are veggie options and the service is always quick and friendly.  

I also love the back patio with the colourful murals, it's a quiet oasis in the middle of this chaotic street!"}
{"text":"I can't remember when I had a lunch as good as today's ....wait.....the last time was when I was here last ....about 9 months ago. This place ROCKS!! 

Ravi is awesome. I used to pick up lunch here weekly then sadly moved jobs and I  wasn't around the corner any longer.  If your lucky enough to be in the neighbourhood - do not turn down the opportunity to stop in and grab a bite to eat. 

There are always daily specials and the menu is posted on the large blackboard as you walk in. There are only 4 or 5 types of wraps and they are all great !  

If you get here just before noon you beat the rush, even if you get caught in the line - it's well worth the wait.  Every single item on the menu is terrific !  

Today I brought a friend here for a quick lunch and we both had the combo of corn & crab soup and the lamb wrap !! ..........WOW was it fantastic !   The combo is a prefect lunch. 

The restaurant is small and seats about 16 at a very large communal table and there are about 4 additional tables in the back space, or if you prefer to sit facing the street, you could be lucky to grab a spot at the window.  

In the spring, summer and early fall the patio is open and it is a lovely space to have lunch. 

Thanks Ravi - you and your team do a great job and I hope to return soon."}
{"text":"I ordered three soups from Ravi and liked them all for different reasons!

The chicken hot broth is nice and hearty if you are looking for good chicken and vegetables. It has a tad of spice but also sweetness to it.

The red lentil was my favourite as I love curry flavours and it has a great sweetness to it

I also had the butternut squash which was good as well, but I've had better (reason for 4 stars)

RAVI is on Foodora to order online, which was super convenient and fast for me. I'll be ordering again and trying the wraps!"}
{"text":"Great great place for a hearty meal. I've had the majority of items on the menu and have never been disappointed. 

Chicken wrap is a bit plain for me but good for the unadventurous. Lamb wrap is Delicious. 

I've had many of the soups and they always impress. Especially during the winter months of course. 

Soup & wrap combo is a bit pricey (close to $20 I believe) but still good value. 

Friendly staff as well :D"}
{"text":"I love the soup here! Had the apricot and red lentil soup with the wrap. Wrap was amazing and had a masala taste that wasn't overpowering. The soup was hearty and flavourful. The price was great!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on Sunday, had the mushroom soup and pork wrap- i have to say the soup and wrap were both delicious- it has a fusion type feel to the food and i would definitely go back. Eating on a lazy Susan was definitely a first for me!"}
{"text":"Ravi locations are phenomenal. I hope they open a review page up soon as I would like to celebrate how good the Charles Street location has been since opening up.

Keep it up Ravi crew - your wrap/soup combo's are affordable, delicious & warming on the coldest of winters day.

For first time visitors I always recommend the chicken wrap, chicken hot pot broth or the apricot & lentil soup - all are incredible.

The only point of criticism I would have is that the soups/wraps individually are a little pricey, perhaps offering smaller portions as a snack may do the lunch trade even better.

Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I have been going to RaviSoups since day one. His soups are outstanding. I think I have had the soup/wrap combo ONCE. 
Whats great about his menu is that it hasnt changed. Ravi knows what he does well and he doesnt change it. I'm impressed.
I usually go \"off hours\" so there's no line ups as I know this a popular place.
Hope everyone gets a chance to try his soups one day soon."}
{"text":"3.5
got soup and sandwhich it was pretty good.  didnt appreciate the spice it was in everything the sandwhich and the aoup.  though it was good spice i dont want it in everything..."}
{"text":"The magical ways that his soups are put together make my mouth salivate! this place is spectacular! I have nothing but great things to say. If you have not tried Ravi Soups - you MUST!!!! The various combinations are amazing! Some may think the soups are pricey, but it's real gourmet. I for one can never finish off a soup in one shot...they are so filling. 

I constantly crave this place's soups but alas, it is far from home and I can only treat myself to it once in a while (at least 1 per month)."}
{"text":"We just walked out of the service Canada and walked into this restaurant as it was just around the corner and I don't know.! Th chicken hot pot soup had such a unusual combination of flavours. It doesn't taste as good as it sounds. There wasn't a self service water dispenser so I was expecting the server to bring us water to the table. We went a whole meal waiting for water. For me, that's a deal breaker."}
{"text":"Really just excellent. At $11, their Soup & Wrap combo is the best lunch value around.

Ravi's storefront is easy to miss, and the front of house where orders are placed is crowded and chaotic, but only because they are a victim of their own awesome. Several soups and wraps on offer every day, with the selection revolving.

The corn chowder (with Blue Crab chunks!) and the roasted red pepper bisque are phenoms. The porcini mushroom bisque didn't seem very bisquey to me, but had tons of flavour. The Ravi Stew will stick to your ribs and keep you warm all afternoon.

And the wraps! The roasted pork shoulder would be great enough, but the curried lamb wrap is just sensational. Great flavour on the curry, big chunks of lamb, and lots of greens make it really pop. One of the best wraps I've had.

Pro-tip: Go. Then, the next day, go again."}
{"text":"I live right by Ravi Soups and come here on my walk home from work.  It's always dead at that time, which is nice.  While carefully watching him make the wrap, I did notice he put a lot of sauce , which I now say to go light on.  My personal favorite which I now stick to somewhat religiously is the Curried Lamb wrap and Curried Apricot and Lentil soup...so good."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to see Ravi for awhile.  Soup is a whole chapter on it's own in the Culinary textbooks where you have Broths, Consomme, Vegetable Soups, Other Clear Soups, Puree, Bisque, Chowders.  I was pretty excited back when Soup Nazi arrived in Toronto in the form of Original SoupMan at the Eaton Centre back in my time.

It's been awhile since that time and SoupMan no longer exist but there's still Soup lovers everywhere in GTA.  Unfortunately for Ravi, I've had time to learn, taste, experience my way through some Soups since then and now I am giving Ravi Soups A-OK...

Porcini Mushroom Bisque with Wild Rice, Shallots and Truffle Oil($8.99) is something I have had before and it tasted just as GOOD with that depth of Mushroom and the almighty magic of Black Truffle Oil drizzle.  The portion was nice as a light meal and came with a Biscuit for an appetizer.  Priced right in terms of profit margin and white collar business people as patrons.

I'm glad Ravi is around as a Soup-only spot and show that Soup is in itself a Culinary Art that seems simple but can be as complicated as you need however to the normal citizen, all you really have to do is just sip your Soup and feel comforted.  It is just that SIMPLE."}
{"text":"I came here because an old co-worker of mine introduced me - O.M.G everything is so good!!! Can't stop coming here for lunch whenever I didn't bring lunch to work, so much so that my husband goes \"I've noticed this Ravi Soup place on the credit card bill a lot lately...\"

I've had the beef wrap, the chicken wrap, and the chicken stew. Like others have said, the soup and wrap combo is huge portions - I usually save half for dinner. Similarly for the chicken stew, every time I go I've had to ask for a take-out container. How they can make the soup/broth so delicious is beyond me. I really don't think I'm able to recreate the flavours at home... Definitely try this if you've never, especially now that the weather is getting cold!"}
{"text":"I went to Ravi Soups for lunch. There's quite a bit of people during the lunch rush but there's not mix of a line.  

I ordered the sandwich and soup combo. It's quite filling and good for the price. The roasted pork shoulder sandwich was good and the pineapple added an interesting twist from being a bit bland. I really liked the soup. There wasn't much of the blue crab, but soup was pretty solid overall. 

I would definitely return to try the other soups and  sandwiches. I'd also want to try the Ravi stews I definitely recommend getting the soup and sandwich combo. I'd recommend making reservations if you are looking to be eating in. They were quite accommodating for my group of six."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend and two friends for a quick dinner before we headed over to an event. This was my first time here.  I ordered the soup and wrap combo - the corn chowder and the pork shoulder wrap. I have to say the prices on their menu is average pricing for places like this. The food was fresh.  The flavors were delicious. I would say this place is great for lunch and a light quick dinner too. I think my favourite was the soup. The soup was really delicious and it had the right amount of spice in it to make it flavorful but not overly spicy. I would definitely come back to this place and would recommend others to come try too. I think next time I am going to try their stew."}
{"text":"One of the best lunch locations I've yet experienced in Toronto. The presentation of the wrap+soup combo is artsy and utilitarian; the soups are unique and full of umami; the wraps sometimes have a bit too many spices in them, but always end up satisfying you. The interior is beautiful: there's a large driftwood table in the center of the main room, and toward the back there is a lovely outdoor area. The staff is friendly and graciously allowed me to interview several people there over a few days.

5/5. Would bang."}
{"text":"Dropped into this place for a lunch meet-up and it was very hearty and flavourful.

For a fast casual place, this location is probably better for take-out then sit-in.  They don't really have tables inside just the stools along the wall but they do have a few tables on their snug patio.

I got the miso soup with beef flank and the roasted pork shoulder wrap.  The portion will definitely fill you up for lunch and they serve it on your own personal lazy susan so you can easily switch between wrap and soup.

The roasted pork shoulder wrap had that Ravi slaw which had mango and pineapple that really made it more vibrant.  The miso soup was tasty and had a bit of a kick to it too.

This is a solid place to have a quick and healthy lunch downtown."}
{"text":"So flavour-full. So good! Loved their apricot soup and the oven roasted veggie wrap. Definitely part of my regular list!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, best of Toronto! The wraps are packed with Indian flavor, complemented with rich soup."}
{"text":"Delicious food and very generous portions. Definitely recommend if you are in the area. Loved the pineapple in the chicken hot pot soup!!  The porcini mushroom soup and grilled chicken wrap were delicious as well."}
{"text":"This place is like anywhere else that serves up an exceptional service or product. It's more expensive, but so worth it. 

I always order this up for my clients. It's way better than the bland wraps out there."}
{"text":"Ok, i've heard alot about this place, but never had the fortitude to venture into this seemingly sketchy hole in the wall by myself, but decided to go for it one day while downtown for lunch by myself. Read the Yelp reviews and decided on the popular corn and crab chowder and the curried Lamb wrap. The chowder was delish, with a refreshing aroma of corn, and (very) small bits of real crab, really enjoyed that. The wrap was a good size, and had excellent curry flavour, my only complaint was it seemed to be on the dry side, and more sauce would have done wonders to its deliciousness.. Anyhoo for $15 its quite an expensive lunch combo, but its nice to have finally given it the old college try. Oh and they have nice wooden stained oak tree like furniture, solid like lumber!"}
{"text":"It's one of my, if not the, go-to spots for lunch in the Entertainment District area!  It's a small space, especially when it's too cold to go onto the patio.  Guests order at the counter when they enter and the food is brought to you - no wait staff.  What it lacks in comfort and ambience, it makes up in food.  The soups and wraps are AWESOME!  And the service is efficient and friendly.  Case in point, last week, my wife spilled her soup all of the table and they quickly wiped it up and brought her a new bowl.  Happy making. 

I've had the Apricot Soup, Portobello Mushroom Soup, Corn Chowder.  All thumbs up!!!  I've had the veggie wrap, pork shoulder and lamb wraps.  Veggie and lamb were excellent.  The pork was a tad dry, imo.  Personally, I always get the wrap and coup combo.  As others have noted, it's not cheap at $13, but it's really good food!  I also love that the food always arrives on these individual sized lazy susans.  Well, I did until my wife spilled her soup b/c of a outta control spinning susan.   

I'm salivating, just thinking about it.  Oh, this place FILLS UP at lunch, but it's pretty much empty at 11:55am, so I'd invest the extra 5-10 mins to show up just a touch before noon."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal here tonight. Came here on a friends suggestion to try some place new. I called ahead not sure if I needed to make reservations due to all of the positive reviews on yelp. Got there and it wasn't busy. Ordered the soup and wrap combo, lamb wrap and butternut squash soup. The lamb wrap was pretty awesome, it had curry base so it helped knock out some of my under the weather I was feeling. The soup was delicious, it was hot and complimented the wrap perfectly. Will definitely return for the same thing again!"}
{"text":"Thanks to all the yelpers on helping me make my decision to have my first meal in Toronto at RaviSoups. What a perfect way to start my vacation. 
What a cute little place to warm up with some yummy soup. The roasted red pepper bisque with the veggie wrap was delicious. A prefect combo. 
This is definitely a place that I will come back to next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I kept hearing about how amazing the butternut squash soup was so I decided to try it out. I was pretty disappointed considering it didn't really taste that good. They used a combination of spices that overpowered and did not compliment the squash at all. 

I'll go back, but I won't be trying the butternut squash again."}
{"text":"I was at home this evening, feeling like I was coming down with something, and I did a Yelp search for chicken soup.  Ravi Soups came up, and the photos looked great.  There was a minimum order required for delivery ($50.00) , so I ordered several items, knowing that I could put the extra items in my fridge, and have them for lunch tomorrow and the following day.  I placed my order and the gentleman on the other end of the line said hey would call when the food was ready, and prior to delivery.  He called back, and 10 minutes later, the food was at my door.  I thought this was a very nice courtesy.  I took the lid of all the soups and stew, thinking I would taste each and just have one for my dinner.  I went from butternut squash soup, to porcini mushroom soup, to chicken  hot pot broth, to ravistew.  With each item, I could not believe how amazingly fresh and flavourful, each one was.  Each soup was unique and different, with spectacular ingredients. I just kept going back and forth from one to the other, enjoying the different flavours. The butternut squash soup is by far the best I have ever had. Ravi is King of Soups.  To top things off, the soups unexpectedly came with a delicious cheddar cheese biscuit that could probably rival some of the top French pastry chefs (I'm not kidding)!!  Finally, I couldn't resist biting into the wraps that were going to be saved for the next day's lunch. I ordered both the Free Range Chicken Wrap, and the Flank Steak Wrap. Once again, I was pleasantly surprised by the freshness, flavour combinations, and quality of ingredients. Ravi you have a new fan.  Now if you could just lower the delivery minimum to $30.00, and reduce the delivery fee, I would be in Ravi heaven."}
{"text":"Great soups - somewhat spicy overall but very tasty. The Ravi stew is by far my favourite with their free range chicken sandwich.  The curry one is great too but too spicy along with any of their soups.  Hopefully, they will move to a larger place for better seating.

Food: 4/5 (Ravi stew and the beef miso is the best and get it with the chicken sandwich or the curry if you want spicy - the food could however get very spicy so be careful)

Service: 3.5/5 (not much service but they bring you the food in a nice plate - it's a very small joint so it's hard to get seated and the kitchen is right in the middle)

Ambience: 3/5 (they need a better location and more ventilated; at times, it gets very damp and humid due to the soups and people creating heat)

Price: 2.5/5 (kind of pricey for soup around $15 per person) 

Tips; try to get there early for lunch time as their line ups get really long or order ahead of time."}
{"text":"Spicy lamb wrap served on a turn plate with a little salad! mmmm I like it!

Also the decor was pretty awesome - i wish i came in the summer to sit in the patio. The massive wooden table in the room is also pretty fantastic. love it."}
{"text":"After reading great reviews about this place, I've been looking for an excuse to come here. I checked out their Queen W location, which is a couple blocks past Ossington. On a Saturday afternoon, it wasn't too busy. I instantly felt warm and cozy when I walked in, and we were able to snag a table right at the front window. 

There is a great variety of unique soup options. I went with the corn chowder.  I was a little weary about the 'chowder' component being too heavy, but was explained they use coconut milk/cream as their base, and not too much of it. My friend had the butternut squash. Our soups came to $10 each.

The serving size was great! And I love the little spinning table they serve it on. We also got a lovely crisp cheese scone..melt in your mouth. I really enjoyed my soup. It was hearty, but as desired, not overly heavy. In fact our server came by to ask what we  thought of the soup, as they were trying out a new brand of coconut milk and wanted to make sure it came out the same. What great service and attention to customer satisfaction.

Ah, another great lunch experience in Toronto. Go here for great soup!!!  Flavour is on par with soup nutsy, but Ravi soups wins for dining experience/ambiance."}
{"text":"I find myself returning to my favorite restos time and time again in Toronto. Ravi soups is one of them! There are two locations. Both are great and there is no difference in food flavour or menus

I got my favorite wrap with curried lamb and mango. It's a touch spicy but nothing crazy. I also tried the Ravi stew, very hearty with chicken and I love the sweet potato. Also really enjoy the cheddar biscuit with the soup. A combo is enough to keep you full. 

Great service, reasonable price. Usually around $13-14 with tax for combo. Has bathroom downstairs. Plenty of seating. Good hours, open until 9-10pm most nights. Free wifi."}
{"text":"I been to Ravi Soups many times including this afternoon. Usually I get my favorite Curried Lamb wrap, which is the best thing in their menu but today I got Chicken wrap which was very flavorful but wouldn't rate it as high as the curried lamb wrap. Wrap and soup combo is more economical if you are looking to try both. Ravi wraps are pretty big in size but they little price compared to shawarma wraps. I would recommend y'll to try."}
{"text":"Mmm...love me some Ravi Soups. This place was absolutely divine!! :)

Over the holidays, Husband and I made another trek across the border to Toronto to expand our culinary adventures in this great cosmopolitan city. Ravi Soups was on my to try list for ages, and this trip, we were finally able to make it.

From the exterior, the place is a bit hidden, but mostly because the signage is hand written in a script fashion. I love the rustic and hand written style, but if you're not careful, you can easily miss this place. However, if you miss it, just round the corner at John St. and you can loop over. Whatever you do, don't give up on trying this place!

Once we found parking, we scrambled inside to quickly seek some warmth. After perusing the menu offerings, we decided to split their curried lamb wrap ($8.99) and their corn chowder ($8.99). FYI, you place your order and pay, and then grab a seat.

The seating arrangement is a bit funky with a long communal table running a good length of the place made out of carved wood, with a 4-5 side tables and a small bar off the entrance. Husband and I love sitting at communal tables, so this was definitely a nice touch to our eating experience. There were already 7 people sitting at the communal table by the time we arrived, and they all seemed to have ordered the soup and wrap combo. Priced at $10.99, i think this is a great deal if you're looking for a smaller portion of their wraps and soups.

However, since Husband and I were hungry, we went with the regular portion which was filling, earthy, and extremely flavorful. The lamb wrap had such a fragrant taste with the cumin seeds and the yams incorporated throughout. The subtle bitter undertones of the baby spinach amplified the curry taste in the lamb. Not only was the lamb moist and tender, but it was just the right temperature (not too hot and not warm either - heaven in my mouth!). A great mint chutney with mango pineapple salsa topped off each bite.

Now the corn chowder was another story. :) The sweet flavor of the corn really balanced out the woodsy flavor of the lamb wrap. Topped with some shredded crab meat and thai basil, I had never experienced a wonderful corn chowder like this. What was awesome about it also was that some of the corn kernels were left whole in the pureed soup. The small bits throughout was really nicely thought out. Crab meat wasn't just topped but it was mixed in throughout and they were generous in the amount placed in the soup without being unbalanced.

Since it was cold outside (~20F), this place really hit the spot. Fresh ingredients, good portions, great value, relatively quick service, and friendly service, Ravi Soups is a must visit if you are into Indian-Southeast Asian inspired wraps and soups in the Toronto Downtown Core. 

Great for vegetarians, carnivores, omnivores, kids, adults! We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Great food for a good price. Got the lamb wrap, which was fantastic, and the corn chowder (it was ok, clashed with the wrap a little and was piping hot). Place has a cool interior and quick service. I'll change my review to 5 stars when I go back and get a good soup."}
{"text":"I've only been here once but definitely plan to come back!

I came here with my running group and there eight of us who ran 14k with this place as the final destination on a Saturday morning.

The prices are on par with soup prices at \"fancy\" restaurants but you get a good deal if you go for the combo with a wrap (although the soup portion is a bit less in a combo).

The soup variety are not the typical ones you find in a can at your local grocery chain so you'll definitely fulfil any culinary desire to try something that's not \"run of the mill\".  

I also enjoyed the presentation of the food where you are provided with a personal Lazy Susan to help you navigate your meal.  Definitely a nice touch!

After the feedback and word of mouth, the eight of us plan to run back here but it sounds like our running group will double!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot at all locations never been disappointed. The wrap and soup combos are a hearty lunch. My favourites are the lamb wrap and the corn chowder. Service is efficient and courteous. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I was there on the date of their anniversary when they ran a \"pay what you wish\" model. The burger and all the other food was delicious, it arrived very fast, and all the staff were personable and friendly. Oh, and their banana bread is the best ever, and believe me when I say I've had a lot of banana bread."}
{"text":"Loved this little place! It was in walking distance from our airbnb so we just checked it out tonight.  The butternut squash soup was so amazing I would go back tomorrow for that alone it was  creamy but lots of squash chunks

I also got the chicken salad which had goat cheese and tomatoes in it and being a goat cheese fan I thought it was fantastic. Cute little place would def go again"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Had the roasted vege wrap and the lentils soup, simply amazing. Im actually from Montreal and everytime im in TO, Ravisoups is a must!"}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times and have really enjoyed each experience. They use quality ingredients and the portions are generous. My favourite is the vegetable wrap and mushroom soup."}
{"text":"Had the chicken hot pot broth & the flank steak wrap today for dinner.
It was out of control (in the bestest way possible) how much flavor they both had. 
A delicate balance of spices, sauces and high quality ingredients (yes, you can taste the love they put in it too) make this spot the go to dinner spot in the neighborhood. 
Who isn't always in the mood for a warm belly filled with delicious secret recipe soup and amazing wraps (reminiscent of burrito bandidos, but oh so much healthier and better tasting)?
Especially since it's early autumn, near winter, this hits the spot perfectly.
Perfection. If I could give it six stars, I would give it eight.
Awesome lokale, Fantastic service, Great people."}
{"text":"Dropped by recently to try this place as I heard their soups are delicious. It was pretty busy when I got here but the line moved quickly. There were approximately 5 wraps and 6 or 7 soups to choose from so selection is fairly decent. I got the roasted pork shoulder wrap and Ravi stew. In case you were wondering why there are like 5 different prices for the wrap and soup combo, the more expensive the individual wrap or soup you choose the higher the price of your combo.

The Ravi stew was good with a decent amount of ingredients in it. The wrap was huge and was packed full of meat and veggies. I did find the roast pork a little dry but overall it was ok.

There isn't  too much space in the seating area and given how busy this place can get might want to consider doing take-out 

Overall a pretty good place if you like soups and prices are reasonable for what you get. I look forward to coming back and trying the butternut squash soup."}
{"text":"This restaurant can be described as Cafe food with East Asian flavours. I ordered the curried lamb burrito and squash soup combo and only liked the burrito (the soup lacked flavour), my friend had the stew and said it was super filling. 

Both of us were not prepared for the spicy and flavour level, we recommend this for a cold winter day, or when you are sick and needs a little something to help you breath better. 
TBH, both of us were sweating a little by the end of our meal, we now understand why they leave like 20 pitchers of water out for the customers :P"}
{"text":"$10.99 Combo: Lentil and apricot soup + pork shoulder wrap

Not the best soup or wrap I've ever had in my life BUT decent in terms taste + volume of food for the price.* I would've preferred if the soup + wrap were more flavourful. 

*Special note: Wrap had a generous amount of meat!"}
{"text":"I came down with a cold so I decided to come here for a bowl of chicken soup, after reading all the great reviews and also sick of going to Tim Hortons. I got the chicken hotpot, and it was well presented. 

When I took my first sip, though, damn was it spicy. It was so spicy. I reread the ingredients list to see if there was a hint of anything spicy. Nothing. I took another sip and it got even spicier. My throat was hurting so much at that point, so I went to ask the guy what was making it so spicy. He said, \"lemongrass\". I knew for a fact that lemongrass isn't supposed to be spicy, so I asked him if he was sure. He said he was. 

I told him it was too spicy for me and asked if he could do something about it. He just shrugged and got the next customer in line. 

$10+ for a bowl of spicy chicken soup. So not worth it. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Hands down the best soup in Toronto.

I've brought numerous people here with different palettes and every single person has absolutely fallen in love. The wraps are crispy on the outside and super flavorful and savory on the inside. The soups are all bursting with flavor right until the last spoonful.

Fav soups: Ravistew, Shrimp bisque, Butternut squash

Fav wraps: Flank Steak, Free Range Chicken, Vegetable

Highly recommended! Go! Go now!

...just do it ;)"}
{"text":"I don't even think my own mother could make soup better than Ravi.

You may think to yourself that soup isn't a meal.  You may think to yourself that soup isn't worth basing an entire restaurant around.  You may even be so crazy as to think that you're not really that into soup.  Well, not only would you be wrong all all counts, you've clearly never been to Ravi Soups.

You have options.  There are beef soups, squash soups, lentil soups, curried soups, everything!  When you order soup, it comes with a biscuit and some different jam type things that you can eat with it.

But, I concede, sometimes you want more than a soup.  They've got wraps.  In fact they have a soup and wrap combo, which comes with a slightly smaller soup, and a smaller wrap, but which satisfies so thoroughly, that you really wonder if you'll ever be this happy again.  The answer is yes: on your next trip to Ravi's.

The only downside is that it's not free.  In addition to not being free, it's not super cheap, either.  A soup or combo meal will cost you anywhere from $10-$13."}
{"text":"I tried the steak and the chicken wrap. At first it seemed a little bland but as I ate, the fresh taste of the ingredients won me over. It wasn't soaked/covered up with sauce nor salt so you could really taste every individual ingredient. The chicken was amazing, tasted home-made and the steak was not tough at all. It's hard to find places that competes with heartiness rather than how special or different it is from the norm. Would love to try their soup next time!"}
{"text":"RaviSoups is a downtown favourite lunch spot located on Adelaide west of Peter Street. 

My colleagues and I often head over to Ravi when in need of some major comfort food during lunch time.  As a great spot for take-out or dine-in, Ravi always seems to be the place to indulge for most of us in the Fashion and Entertainment districts.

Ravi gets his inspiration from native Sri Lanka. As previous  saucier and known \"soup master\" of Mildred Pierce, he decided to open up his own kitchen and enchant us with his creative and delicious soups and wraps. Inspired by exotic ingredients from beautiful Sri Lanka and other parts of Asia, Ravi has been able to wow the crowds of 9-5ers looking for a different and tasty lunch fix.

Although all of the featured wraps at RaviSoups are amazing, my absolute favourite is the Curried Lamb wrap.

This wrap has the most delicious and creative ingredients one can never find in any other wrap, anywhere! This unique flour creation comes with lamb, roasted yams (a.k.a sweet potatoes), baby spinach, mango pineapple salsa, edamame, lime chili and mint cilantro. That's Ravi's secret, innovation and creativity with flavour in mind!

That said, Ravi's famed reviews come from his hearty and yummy soups; hence the name RaviSoups.  The soups are something extraordinary and tasty. For those that are soup-averse, you will need to try Ravi before you say \"pass\". 

My choice for lunch usually starts with the Curried Apricot and Red Lentil Soup. A must have.

Though my belief is that Ravi does not disclose the full length of the spices and ingredients of the soups, he does provide a sneak peek at what seems to be the best possible combination for a hearty soup - red lentils, curry flavoured apricot (my guess is this is blended in the curry), cilantro and lime creme fraiche. And that's just a preview, your palette will be able to tell you more once you try it, trust me!

Since RaviSoups is still working on their website, I have not been able to include a link to it. However, one good piece of information I can share is that Ravi has another location on Queen Street West close to the Drake Hotel.

Viviana."}
{"text":"I got a combo (half size wrap and Ravi slaw) for about $14.50 with tax and tip included. I got a chicken wrap which was packed with chicken breast and other ingredients! And the slaw was also very tasty with lots of creamy sauce, edamame, apples, and baby spinach. Food is served on a spinning tray that is made out of wood. It makes the food more photogenic and enjoyable. Service was super quick and friendly. 

The kitchen and dining area inside were very hot (they did not have AC on at that time). But, there is a very spacious patio tucked outside the back of the place! I want to go back just to eat outside again. 

Overall, good quality of food, friendly service, and a nice patio. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a healthy, tasty meal."}
{"text":"Very simple,  yet very tasty wraps.  Corn chowder soup was ok, but the Ravi soup was great with lots of authentic Indian spices."}
{"text":"I'm not a big soup person so I wasn't wow'd by the soup I ordered. But the curried lamb wrap was amazing. If I go back here I'll just stick with a wrap. I also found this place a bit over priced.  I went at lunch and the place was pretty busy but I got my order quick."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everything is excellent: food+service. Get a soup/salad or soup/wrap combo and make ur way through the menu. 

The in-store ambience is warm and cozy to me. A big wood table to eat at community style or in the summer the patio is my favourite. The mural is nice to stare at. 

Chicken hot pot soup is A+
Curried lamb wrap is juicy, boneless, flavourful and hearty. 

Great veg options as well. My go-to during a cleanse. 

You can call ahead to do a pickup or use Ritual as during peak times they are hella full."}
{"text":"Came in on a cold night with a soup craving, and Ravi didn't disappoint.

Ambience: I'd recommend staying in the front half of the restaurant.  Although the back half is where the majority of the seating is, the walls are flaking paint, there's absolutely zero decor on the walls, and you basically feel like you're eating in some small community hall rather than in a relatively pricey soup joint.  But it was clean, so kudos for that.

Service: took about 5-10 minutes to get our order with very few patrons there, but not bad.  Kinda strange that they flipped our orders with the only other table there, but that was quickly rectified.  I'd hate to see though what happens when the place is full!

Soup: tried the apricot/lentil and the chicken curry hotpot.  The apricot/lentil was really nice - you could really taste both flavours, as well as a nice blast of cilantro.  The chicken curry hotpot was a little more meh - a touch on the spicy side but not in a good way - it just masked the relative blandness underneath - it's tough to make curry uninspired but they did it..  Both soups came with the biscuit with jelly - I could've just eaten a plate of that all night - it was fricking good.  Also tried the slaw which was pricey ($5) but a nice refreshing side dish.  

Overall - good food, average value.  I was bordering on 3 stars here, because of decor, small service snafu, and one of the soups being a bit uninspiring, but then I thought of those biscuits and jelly, and had to go at least 4 stars.  I'll be back to try some other soups soon!"}
{"text":"I didn't have a good experience here at all. Very complex flavors and unusual pairings in both soups & wraps, but I wasn't impressed with the flavors nor the quality of the meat in the wraps, especially at this price point. I would have rated them 3 stars, but the service was awful. We were told they didn't have alternatives to brie cheese however the special of the day had cheddar cheese on it. When I asked if I could have the cheddar cheese that came with the tuna special on our wraps, the person who took our order said yes but both came with brie cheese, which I specifically stated I did not like. Ordered a muffin, had to ask for it twice after our food was prepared. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Recommendation: Great tasting wraps complimented by feel-good soups. Great place for a hot breakfast or lunch during cold days! Definitely coming back soon. MUST TRY.

I ordered: Lamb curry wrap + corn chowder combo. HOWEVER, they got my soup wrong and gave me Porcini Mushroom Wild Rice Bisque soupe instead. 

+1 Price vs portion: Looks small but you won't be hungry after eating everything. 

+1 Taste: The Lamb curry wrap was so flavorful that I want to try all the other wraps. Even though the soup was wrong but I kept it anyway. Turns out, the mushroom soup was on the blander side which perfectly complimented the intense and spicy wrap. 

-1 Customer service: Even though it was a good accident, I would be happier eating what I ordered. 

+ 1  Comfortable place to eat: A bit clumped up but it's downtown so can't really complain. They have a huge table in the middle so that's good for a small group. 

-1 no \"Wow!\" factor, felt like a fast food place."}
{"text":"Caught this place for dinner prior to TIFF and was completely satisfied. Order the free range chicken wrap and corn chowder w/ crab. Awesome!"}
{"text":"3/5
So I finally made a trip to Ravi Soup. After all the good reviews and my friend's recommendation, I was very excited about this place. 

 I ordered soup and wrap combo: curry lamb wrap & corn crab chowder which was around $12-3 include tax. What a great deal?! However when I got my food I was bit disappointed. Corn chowder was decent but nothing special. It was creamy chowder with bits of corns and light touch of crab meat. When I heard about corn chowder, I was expecting deep corn flavor and a nice touch of crab meat.  There was barely no corn flavour or actual corn in the soup. To be fare, soup itself was still better than a lot of other awful places, but it definitely didn't meet my expectation. Same for the wrap, but at least wrap delivered what it promised to deliver. It was a nice fresh wrap packed with lamb meat and a light curry kick.  It has a bit of typical stench of lamb meat but curry covered it nicely. Also after a light kick of curry, sweet potato smoothen the pallette. It was a good balance but still not extraordinary. I personally enjoy more defined and characteristic dishes. if you enjoy not over seasoned dishes, you will definitely enjoy Ravi Soup. 

The restaurant is more of a loud and busy. It's more of hit and run kind of place then an actually restaurant or a quite cafe. There are few small tables and a huge table at the back. It will be a good place to grab something during lunch hour at work. They also have a patio at the back. It was too cold for me to go check out but seems pretty nice. 

Overall, Ravi Soup was a nice place to grab something light and warm food if I'm around the neighborhood. At this point, it's not worth a making trip but just in case if it's a bad day thing, I will have to make one or two more visit to make a right decision."}
{"text":"I've never had a meal here that wasn't delicious. I take my finicky vegetarian sisters and their meat-eating boyfriends here, and both of them love it.  It's awesome!"}
{"text":"This place was very convenient, located right behind the hotel I stayed at (Hyatt Regency). The service was great, very fast! The food was great. Unfortunately I was only in Toronto for four days and didn't get a chance to go back. Highly recommended for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Laid-backgammon, efficient and very good soups and sandwiches : original and very tasty ! However a very small place to eat in : 1 huge wooden table in the middle with around 15 seats + 2 x 4-seat table + 1 x 2-seat table"}
{"text":"I'm a believer!  I arrived here with a relatively large group (about 8 of us in total) on a Friday night, when we were forced to relocate our meeting because the previous place got too loud.  We were pleasantly surprised to find Ravi Soups completely empty, right next to a bustling Khao San Road.

We perched ourselves at one end of the really long wooden table, and before long we were served with an assortment of wraps and soups that we'd each ordered.  Being a pretty easy going group, we didn't think twice about passing food around and tasting everything.  And let me just say, there was nothing that I tried that I wasn't in awe of.  From every spoonful of soup to every morsel of wrap I sunk my teeth into (my favorite was the extra spicy curry lamb wrap that I requested), I was in heaven!  Keep in mind, this was after I already had a dinner entree at another restaurant!  

Ravi Kanagajarah is the man."}
{"text":"I have been here many times for a light but hearty dinner. My go-to soup is the Porcini Mushroom Wild Rice Bisque. I love the biscuit served as a side with all the soups - it is always served warm, buttery and flaky. 

There is an option to eat inside the restaurant. The back of Ravi Soups has a large wooden table with newspapers for patrons. It can be a casual place to catch up with friends while you enjoy your soup.

I would not worry about the portion sizes not being adequate for dinner. The soups are large and the biscuit is filling. If you are worried about being full, I recommend ordering one of the wraps with the soup."}
{"text":"Really yummy fresh veggie wrap.  It's so hard to find fresh legit food in this area."}
{"text":"Good food at a good price and some interesting concoctions to try. Great place to stop in for a quick bite that's NOT fast food, and sitting in the courtyard is so relaxing."}
{"text":"The chicken wrap was good however I ordered the mushroom soup and that wasn't upto my expectations. It was Filled with pepper but the cheddar cheese biscuit was a good side for the soup."}
{"text":"Chicken hot broth, very good soup. 
Wraps equally good. Great comfort food.
The challenge I find is the COST, it's a few bucks too expensive.

{"text":"I tried the curry lamb wrap + mushroom soup combo... Delish!

Although I think the curry lamb wrap is a better combo with the sweet corn soup to balance out the heat from the curry.

The mushroom soup has a nice after kick"}
{"text":"After the CN Tower climb, i wanted to treat myself to khao san Road... it had been a long wait and a long walk and an even longer wait to get back down the tower.... It was 9:30 already and i thought for sure KSR would have seats.... wrong! with about 15 people still lining up, I was heartbroken that I didn't choose to try Smoke's instead.

I saw that Ravi soups was next door and my coworkers rave about it so we walked in there instead. The place was empty but they said they were still serving food.

I opted for the chicken wrap and a mushroom soup - because it claimed ti have truffle oil... yum truffles...and S got the same wrap but with a butternut apple soup.

We parked our butts on the beautiful long tree trunk of a table and waited patiently as our meal came on its separate swivelling susan. The wrap was beautifully wrapped and grilled, looking like a pocket ready to explode in my mouth! At first bite, I was really in love with all the flavours, all the ingredients and all the SAUCE! It was hearty, but not heavy, filling but not overload, and tasty without the grease. it was packed with goodness and I did not want it to end.

The mushroom soup was good, but i have to say the butternut was better - it was just more flavourful and had a surprising kick every once in a while. I didn't taste any truffle in the mushroom soup but I did like the fact it was not creamy heavy, but more stock and mushroom. Also being a really chilly day, I wished that the soup was hotter.

The staff was cleaning and never rushed us out even though it was getting late. I kept eyeing the banana bread on the counter as I was walking out... maybe I'll have to get a slice the next time I come back.

For simple good comfort food .... you really can't get much better than this."}
{"text":"I ordered their soup via hurrier. I selected the Chicken Hot Pot Soup which was lovely and the Ravi stew. However, I think for the price the quantity was not sufficient. The soups were tasty but slightly peppery and the serving needed to be way larger for $9-$12 per soup."}
{"text":"If you're looking for original soups with a little bit of kick then look no further than Ravi Soups. The late, great Ravi infused his soups with curry and love, and the tradition carries on today. 

My go to is the chicken wrap combo with butternut squash soup, but after reading Now's review of the apricot curry lentil I had to give that one a shot too. Mmm delicious! It is so perfectly warming on this somewhat chilly winter day in Toronto, though I actually find the Ravi Stew to be a little bit spicier (and I mean that in a good way!). My friend swears by the veggie wrap, so that's up next on my list of things to try. It has brie in it. BRIE! I can't believe I haven't tried it yet. 

This location is always super busy at lunch time, but service is surprisingly friendly and fast. They have the tiniest little kitchen and yet somehow they're able to handle large quantities of orders quickly and accurately. They have a proven system. Although there's room to sit, I usually get my order to go so I can't comment on the seating or even apparently the little patio that's hidden in the back--but come summer, I will certainly be checking that out. You can count on that!

It's not cheap, but prices are standard for the area and for the amount of food you get--and the satisfaction it brings--it's worth it. Definitely check this place out next time you're craving something that will make you feel all sorts of warm and fuzzy inside."}
{"text":"I had the steak wrap on my most recent visit.  These wraps never disappoint. The service is fast. The prices are ok. The tastes are outstanding. The soup is good... but the wraps is what makes me return for more..."}
{"text":"The beef miso is a bit spicy I like it. The corn chowder is a bit sweet, good taste as well. The beef wrap and lamb wrap both well valued!"}
{"text":"I read many reviews about Ravi soup and never expected that it was such good. I came there about 4pm weekday. The restaurant was not very busy but all staffs were patiently working on their own positions.

 I ordered the small portion of Ravi stew and added a biscuit with pepper jelly to a combo. The soup was very delicious containing various kinds of ingredients such as green beans, chicken breast, potato,carrot and so on. It tasted like latin-style cuisine using herbs to create rich flavour. The biscuit was crisp and not sweet, it matched perfectly with sweet pepper jelly. Really love it~ I would come back for its wraps and other comfortable food."}
{"text":"As a lover of soups, I honestly really wanted to like this place, but unfortunately it just wasn't very good.

I'm usually very indiscriminate with my soups. Soup is my go to appetizer, and I almost always enjoy my order of soup, even if the soup itself isn't the best. I was really looking forward to the soup here, but I ended up disappointed with what I got at Ravi Soups.

I ordered a leek and artichoke soup, and what I got was closer to coconut milk with a sprinkle of leeks. The soup tasted extremely under seasoned to me (if it was seasoned at all), and I have a light palate. It was also lacking in flavour. There was a hint of leek maybe, but all I got was warm coconut milk. I think the most blasphemous fact of all was that the soup wasn't served piping hot, but rather slightly warmer than lukewarm.

The sandwich I got was pretty good though, but this place isn't called Ravi Sandwiches."}
{"text":"Craving a lamb curry wrap...on a cold southern california afternoon, there's only one place that would hit the spot today--Ravi Soups. Sad I'm across the continent.
I had a lamb curry wrap with a corn crab chowder. The lamb curry was surprisingly good, as I was expecting a watered down curry.  It was quite the opposite--great balance of flavors and the chowder I had was great.  I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"When it comes to soups Ravi stands tall amongst others. Ravi definitely delivers that delicious hot bowl of oh-so-satisfying soup we often crave for during the bitter winter months we have to endure. Often proclaimed as \"soup master\" or \"soup king\" of Toronto Ravi unfortunately passed away a few years ago. However rest assure that the Ravi soup legacy is now survived (and carried on) by the dozen or so cousins who he trained personally.

Soups here are unique and ethnocentric. Exotic south east Asian flavours are combined with ingredients we are familiar with. Ravi successfully combines uniquely different flavours to somehow work harmoniously together to create a refine and amazingly delicious bowl of soup. Their wraps are equally compelling albeit not quite as creative as their soups."}
{"text":"Menu: http://ravisoup.com/menu.php

What we had: shrimp bisque (not on online menu), sunchoke soup (not on online menu), italian sausage wrap (not on online menu), curried lamb wrap

Taste: 8/10

The shrimp bisque was quite flavourful and had small chunks of shrimp in it. We both quite liked it. The sunchoke soup was disappointing in comparison, didn't really have much distinct flavour and not very memorable.  The curried lamb wrap was very well done, the squash went very well with the meat.  The italian sausage wrap was fairly lackluster, the meat tasted like the stuff you purchase from supermarkets.

Value: 6/10

We got the soup and wrap combo for $14 (wrap + half a bowl of soup).  Individually, the lamb wrap is 10$, italian sausage wrap 11$, 10$ for shrimp bisque, 11$ for sunchoke soup.  We were both really full after the meal.  

**Average cost per diner: $16 After Tax+Tip

Service/Convenience: 7/10

The place is fairly easy to locate. The service is fairly quick; you go in and order at the front counter, if you're having your meal there you find a seat yourself and wait for a server to call your order number, otherwise you wait at the front for your to-go order. This place gets very crowded at lunchtime and it may be difficult to find a seat. There is not a lot of space and the seating area can get very, very cramped. Even entering/exiting the seating area may require tip-toeing so you do not trample on other people or their stuff. 

Water seemed to be self-serve however it wasn't too clear where we could have gotten it.

Would go back? Yes, if we're in the area and we're craving soup & wraps.

Would recommend to friend? Yes, if they like soups in general.  Would also recommend the curried lamb wrap.

Similar places: Zoup

**Disclaimer: Average cost per diner constitutes the amount (per person) we eat to get full without drinks. Total cost is usually divided between 2 diners, one of whom can regularly eat 7 slices of XL pizza (16\") in one sitting."}
{"text":"I finally decided to try out Ravi Soups after reading a tonne of great reviews. They have a soup and wrap combo for 10.99 which is pretty good value. I see that a lot of people love the actual restaurant but I wasn't that big a fan of the location tbh. I don't usually like sitting at community tables so maybe thats why I didn't like it. The whole restaurant felt a bit dingy though that could just have been the weather. 
I got the porcini mushroom soup and roasted pork shoulder wrap. The wrap was excellent and I highly reccomend it. The herbs and the sauce go really well with the meat. However I was a little dissapointed with my soup. It felt a bit too salty and harsh. My friend got curried apricot soup instead which tasted much much better. Reading over the menu again I think I should have gotten the chicken hot pot instead. Maybe next time. One thing I didn;t like is the fact that the soup was served on one of those lazy susan rotating trays which made it a bit wierd to eat. Overall a really good restaurant. Not fully convinced its the best in Toronto though."}
{"text":"Great wrap and soup combos! Really big space inside. We went on a sat night and it was empty. Probably because the location is a bit hard to find? We went to the one downtown adelaide before which was much busier. The quality is similar. I would say the chowder soup here had a bit less meat though. We had the lamb wrap, the pork wrap, the mushroom and the corn chowder soup. All great. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent mushroom soup and corn chowder soup. The corn chowder had crab meat chunks inside. Both were very flavourful. Great soup and wrap deal, especially for dinner. The lamb wrap was really moist. Nice seating in the back. It's probably a lot busier during the lunch hour, but we got seating no problem for dinner"}
{"text":"I'm just repeating what others have already said, but one more glowing review never hurt anyone. This place is awesome. They serve soups and wraps. All the soups are delicious. All the wraps are delicious. That's their trick. The place is perpetually packed, so grabbing a seat for lunch can be tricky. Take out is probably your best bet. The place has a big back patio. It's surprisingly big. I usually get the $11 soup and wrap combo. It's a good amount of food, and it's probably easier to justify spending that much on the combo rather than $9-10 for big bowls of fancy soup. I'd like to talk about all the different soups you can get, but I keep getting the Butternut Squash. it's too good.

The restaurant is run by a bunch of Tamil dudes, so that's basically a reason to go right there. What!"}
{"text":"Came here with friends after catching a movie and you can't go wrong at Ravi Soups.  Got the Ravi Stew and it was a lot more food than I thought I was getting - you get a large bowl of soup with a biscuit on the side.  Very hearty and filling soup for $10.99+tax."}
{"text":"I tried the butternut squash soup and loved it. You get a lot of soup per serving. The biscuit and the sauce that comes with the soup were also delicious. We also tried the chocolate banana bread on the side which was very fresh. The only downside was the temperature, it was very cold inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"We stumbled on Ravi Soups as we were wandering looking for a place to eat and I'm glad we decided to give it a try. The service was friendly and the food was fantastic. I had the Ravi Stew which was loaded with chicken, sweet potatoes and a bunch of other yummy goodness. I walked in staving and left nice and full!"}
{"text":"That is some DYNAMITE soup right there.

Personally, my favourite is the corn chowder with blue crab. So good. But I can also vouch for the comforting deliciousness of the porcini mushroom with truffle oil, the butternut squash with apple and the coconut chicken.

All soups are served with a flaky biscuit and red pepper jelly. For $10 it's a wonderful, satisfying meal.

Other things: the wraps here are great too. Ditto the slaw. And Ravi has 3 locations to soup you better...Adelaide, Queen West and Dundas West. Soup lovers unite! :)"}
{"text":"The service is really quick. I really like the interior, and there is a outdoor patio that can be used as well. I ordered a Curried Lentil and Apricot soup. It was way too spicy for me. I couldn't really eat more than 1/4 of it on the spot. Then I took the rest home and it took me about 3 or 4 days to finish. The portions are good, I think it's worth your money. Next time I will pick a soup that is more tame for my taste buds."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch one day. This place is easy to miss as there isn't a big sign or noticeable location. It gets overshadowed by the hipster place next door. I came in and wanted to try the soup and wrap combo which was nicely priced. The drink selection isn't great though, and the freezer wasn't exactly cold. Once I ordered, I sat down to get a view of the outside, nothing too special, but it was a gorgeous day out. The soup and wrap was brought out to me and the presentation of it all was beautiful. The service was fast and really really nice. The food tasted fantastic, and it really speaks to the kind of diversity you will find in Toronto as far as food is concerned. I've included a picture of my meal for reference."}
{"text":"Amazing find. Enjoy fresh spicy healthy soups? Ravi hits the spot. Vegetarian options. Compassionate meat choices. Don't be put off by the casual atmosphere: Ravi is simple and splendid. (Bonus: if you have a cold, just what the doctored ordered!)"}
{"text":"I love soup.  I coule eat soup every day.  The soups and wraps at Ravi's establishment are veryflavourful and satisfying.  I tried a curried apricot and lentil soup with a lime cream drizzle and I sampled the butternut squash soup.  Both were awesome.  I look forward to going back to this place for lunch.  Some vegetarian options and a banana bread that I have yet to try.
I went to the Queen Street West location (they also have a location at Adelaide/Peter).  Plenty of space to sit here, I like the counter space myself."}
{"text":"Lamb Wrap. Huge portion. Delicious. Hearty. Flavourful. Great Value. Can't. Complain. Love."}
{"text":"One of my favourite wraps franchises in Toronto. Their wraps are thick, stuffed with a ton of fresh veggies and mouth-watering sauces, and hit the spot just right.

This spot was unknown to me (and many, apparently, until they recently put up the new sign). Glad I saw it, walking out of the movies and looking for some late night grub. Tried the chicken wrap for the first time, and it was delicious (no surprises there!). But still, my go-to when I hit up my Ravi soups kitchen is the lamb. Rich and flavourful, these wraps are the bomb!

Oh, and the soups are fantastic. Get both in the combo for maximum satisfaction.

This location is the smallest I've seen so far. It's got a few stools along the walls and could comfortably fit maybe 10 people sitting. Good for takeout for sure."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot in Toronto! I got the Soup and Wrap combo and it was a substantial lunch. Curried lamb wrap and Ravi stew were delicious! Fast service. Can sit inside or on the back patio. I will be back."}
{"text":"Quiet, relaxed atmosphere where friends you don't know yet rule definitely applies as you sit around large oak table at the back of restaurant. The soups and sandwichs are incredible and prices are more than fair. You will not be hungry when you leave. Go"}
{"text":"I have been to the Queen West locations a few times now. The counter staff are friendly, efficient and helpful. I've always been offered samples when I've been unable to decide on what soup to order. 

The soup and wrap combo is a pretty good deal- filling and the soups definitely have a home-made quality to them. 

My only issue is that I wish they had more non-spicy options. Aside from the veggie wrap, I find most of the wraps a bit too spicy for my taste (note: I really really wish I liked spicy food but just can't get accustom.... Most people probably wouldn't find this to be an issue with Ravi)."}
{"text":"The soups are so good and the wraps are massive! I usually finish the soup and get the wrap to go. The shape of the store makes for a very awkward lineup but its still worth it!"}
{"text":"I've had Ravi Soups twice now, both occasions where I was feeling under the weather. Is there anything more comforting than a bowl of soup when you're not feeling well? Fortunately for me, though, I'm not sick that often-- their steak wrap & soup combo comes in at over $16. A tad pricey but worth it when you feel like shit and the thought of eating anything else makes you feel nauseous.

Both times I ordered the flank steak wrap and soup combo. First time I went with the curried apricot and lentil soup and most recently got the mushroom and wild rice. Both absolutely delicious, but I think I like the curried apricot and lentil better. Makes me never want to crack open a can of soup again. 

This place is always empty whenever I pass by, unfortunately. Makes me wonder if they'll be around much longer. I guess the prices are a bit off putting (individual soups are around $11 before tax) but the food speaks for itself. If you're in the area, definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Soups are always good, and so are their wraps. Just wished they had more sampler or soup/sandwich combos. But if in a rush and want a decent soup and sandwich with kick, this is the place."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last week even though I go by it count less times. Wife and I got a soup + wrap combo and another solo soup to share. I'll keep this review short since it's not about the food, it's about the experience. The quality of the food was okay but sitting in the back with bathroom tiled decor eating our $30 meal did not feel worthy of the price. It didn't feel \"clean\" as another reviewer said and the bright lights just showcase every imperfection of the place.

My review is also slightly biased because I'm generally never craving soup. Not that I don't love a good soup but there is never a day where I say to myself, \"I really need a soup right now.\" It's generally...\"I need a poutine or I need some Asian food.\" Soup...not really. So perhaps that is why I felt as though the price (min $10) for the soups are a little high. I also like paying for \"effort\" and when someone makes soup in bulk, pouring it into a bowl for me doesn't seem like much \"effort\". 

Now if you are a soup lover then this might be the place for you.

3 stars for an average experience due to the decor and the high cost of the simple meal."}
{"text":"I had to update this review and to reconfirm the five star rating !  Ravi Soups is the best quality food chain in Toronto, bar none ! For a little bit more money that other joints you get fresh ingredients wraps that taste amazing and soups that have been actually cooked for hours , not just thickened with corn starch! Service is always friendly and the ambience is relaxed and unrushed. Everything one can wish for!"}
{"text":"I'm here for the Toronto Film Festival and have had a lot of good (and a few not so good) meals over the past few days. This little hole in the wall is the tastiest meal I have had!  I had the grilled vegetable wrap and the curried apricot and lentil soup. Wow. The spices are divine. This little place is a find. Come by and try the soup and wrap combo. You order at the counter. They bring the food to the table - big community table inside and some tables outside on their back patio. Yum!!  Casual and good!!"}
{"text":"The soups are delicious and the portions are healthy in size... the salt content of the soups though, definitely unhealthy. If they could've kept the flavour without all that salt, it's be a full 4 stars.

Don't get me wrong. It IS delicious. Tons of flavour but we were left super thirsty afterward due to the high sodium content.

Extremely efficient operation and the staff seemed very friendly as they brought our soups over. We were there for dinner so it wasn't too packed, but it's small and I can easily see this place getting really busy at lunch time."}
{"text":"I'm sick with the flu at work. I need soup! So I ask my co-worker where there is a good place for soup. He recommends Ravi Soups. I throw on my jacket and head on down. The front of the shop is a bit small and gets crowded when busy. I look at the menu board to see what to order and there is a good selection of soups to choose from. I chose the Shrimp Bisque Soup to go and took it back to the office. I opened it up and started, and sure enough the soup was delicious. The take out soup container was pretty small. I should have opted for dining in as the amount of soup in the bowls were more worth while. The soup came with some kind of biscuit. It was fluffy and moist. Great healing food for my sickness. Overall this place is a great place to go if u feel for some warm hearty soup, although it is a bit pricy for a bowl of soup ($9-11). I would come back for some soup and possibly try a wrap. Jimstar out!"}
{"text":"When craving something warm and hearty, you can rely on Ravi Soups to deliver. On any day, they will have a great selection of great soups and wraps. My usual picks are the butternut squash soup with a curry lamb wrap combo. I recently had the Ravi stew  and it was full of veggies and delicious also.

The combo is filling enough for a lunch meal. However, if you are really hungry, get the full soup (which comes with a delicious looking biscuit) and split a wrap with someone. You will definitely be full as the regular soup size is generous. Thankful that Ravi Soup continues to be a constant reliable source of hearty soups this winter!"}
{"text":"Just had the Porcini Mushroom Wild Rice Bisque with crispy shallots & truffle oil. It was awesome. Soups are served with a delicious cheese biscuit which tastes really fresh and moist. Can't wait to try their other flavours."}
{"text":"I love this place. Such lovely wraps.  The soups are exquisite too. And very economical."}
{"text":"Loved the food at Ravi Soups! Took advice from Yelper and got the curried lamb wrap. It was delicious! Also ordered the porcini mushroom soup. Felt my knees buckle like Elaine in the Soup Nazi episode of Seinfeld. Awesome!"}
{"text":"I had the deliciously overpriced curried apricot and red lentil soup. It was very flavourful, and the biscuit that came along with it was fluffy with a nice outside crunch. I think the $9.99 price tag is a little much but I'd get it again. 

Hubby had the roasted free range chicken wrap. This was also $9.99 but worth the price! It was rather large and contained lots of moist delicious chicken along with yams, spinach, caramelized onions, and edamame, in a lovely tomato chutney and chipotle mayo. 

All in all I love Ravi and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here to check it out due to all the raving reviews and got the soup and wrap combo which was a great deal btw! Ordered the butternut squash soup and chicken wrap and it was alright..  The wrap was a little dry and soup didn't have that sweetness I was expecting. It was alright and perhaps I'll try another soup next time but nothing amazing imo."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch pickup.

Food: Ordered the corn chowder with a curry lamb wrap and my husband had the Ravi Stew.  The Ravi Stew is basically curry with very fresh ingredients, in a healthy and well executed meal.  The cheddar biscuit has that touch of Indian biscuit flavor married with the North American cheddar.  I could not begin to describe how well this place executed on marrying the two cultures.  The corn chowder was tasty and a little sweet.  However, there was almost no crab in this dish.  The Lamb curry wrap was fantastic and had so much flavor from really fresh ingredients.  The portion size is also pretty good and doesn't have you feeling too bad about what you consumed.

Price: The combo meal is a steal but if you order things separate, its pretty pricey for soup.

Decor: Bright and airy in there.  If you want a quick meal its not a bad spot to sit down in.  The kitchen is exposed which is kind of fun.  There was no one sitting in when we went at noon so it felt more like a takeout spot.

Service: Very nice folks, can't complain.

Notable Extras: Nothing really to note, its worth trying if you like Indian food."}
{"text":"My hat goes off to you Toronto Yelpers for helping me find this place.  I just moved to Toronto from the Windy City and with Chicago being the Restaurant Capital of the US, I was worried about how Toronto would stack up with all the chains I have seen downtown.  Ravi's has helped to quell my fears.

The soup I had was filled with fresh (flavorful) ingredients, not only broth, and topped all the soups I have had tried in Chicago...and I am not even a soup person, but am now converted.  If you like going to places like Whole Foods to get soup quickly, save some money and go to Ravi's which is way better (Whole Foods prepared soups are good in their own right).  

The wrap was also great as well; flavorful with great ingredients.  But the soup wowed me since I rarely have soup unless I get sick or feel like having some on the off occassion.  Now, I feel comfortable having soup more regularly, and the wrap/soup combo was quite filling.

The operation itself was very efficient.  There was one cashier and one chef in a tiny open kitchen where you could basically watch him make your food, and he got it done fast.

Hopefully more people in the city start supporting independent establishments like Ravi's soups so that we see the rise of similar places that can give fast food chains a run for their money.  From my experience at Toronto establishments in general so far, I am starting to feel Torontoans may be a bit harder on their restaurants than their Chicago counterparts, but I am too early in the game to have my final say on that."}
{"text":"Delicious, flavorful, savoury soups and wraps. Great and affordable option for lunch or dinner.
Soup & wrap and soup & salad combos available. 
All the wraps are delicious, but I especially enjoy the Curried Lamb.
The Ravi Stew is quite filling compared the the other soups. 
I like that the Porcini Mushroom soup does not have a cream base. 
The Apricot & Red Lentil soup has a lovely combination of sweetness and spice. 
The mango in the Pork Shoulder wrap adds a nice texture and sweetness. 
All the ingredients are extremely fresh and the flavour combinations are delightful!"}
{"text":"Some of the soups are just fantastic, but stay away from the wraps. Totally lacks flavor.
I had a wrap with some beef in it, and it was dry and tasteless."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Perfect blend of ingredients. Loveddd the chicken wrap with butternut squash, two of my favorite things in one. And the corn chowder I ordered was amazing. Decently priced, definitely cheaper than going to a fancy restaurant but with the same flavor and flavor :)"}
{"text":"This is the first time I've trying this place and turns out, it's one of the best places to have lunch! I got the lamb wrap and the squash soup and they were so filling! 

The lamb wrap had a lot of meat stuffed in there and just the right amount of spiciness. Best of all, the wrap didn't fall apart or leaked sauce the entire time! Finally, a place that can make a proper wrap! There was a slight taste of sweetness in the sauce too which I found interesting. 

The squash soup was delicious too! It had a good mix of sweet and savoury flavours with small chunks of potato and onions in there. It feels like a pretty hearty soup. 

The meal feels healthy and substantial enough that it's going to keep me full until dinner. The portions are just perfect! Recommended for lunch takeout!"}
{"text":"Awesome. Ravi Soups has me questioning my other five-star lunch reviews (though at $10.99 for the soup & wrap combo, it's in a different league).

The soup & wrap combo is an easy choice (especially for a first timer), given that a soup order alone - albeit much larger in size - approaches $8-$9.

I love a good mushroom soup, and the Porcini Mushroom Wild Rice Bisque did not disappoint. Tons of mushrooms, and great flavour.

The Roasted Chicken wrap was also a good choice. At first I was worried the inclusion of roasted yams would overpower the wrap, but I found it to be well-balanced. Even with the yams, the meal overall was just filling enough, and perfect for a lunch.

Beautiful patio in the back, and surprisingly not rammed during lunchtime on a weekday.

Useless fact: they serve the combo order on mini lazy-susans.

If you like to plan ahead, the menu is available on their impressively spartan website: http://ravisoups.com/"}
{"text":"This tiny lunch spot was the highlight of my trip to Toronto! Absolutely phenomenal flavors, quick service, and super-reasonable prices. 

I love that they have an option to get a soup and wrap as I am the most indecisive person in the world. The wrap with a smaller portion of soup was absolutely perfect. I had the roasted pork shoulder wrap, which comes with \"RaviSlaw\" - I have no idea what this is, but assume that a key ingredient is crack because I did not want to stop eating it. OMG. This was accompanied by a bowl of the corn chowder which comes with nice big chunks of blue crab. Mmm. The icing on the hypothetical cake was a delicious biscuit - imagine Red Lobster's cheesy biscuits, but classier - served with an awesome savory jam. SO FREAKING GOOD. 

I came with 6 friends and it only took about 10 minutes for all of us to be served. The dining area is small but we had no trouble fitting around the massive table that looks like it's a big tree cut in half (my guess is that it looks like that because it is ...). Prices were very reasonable and we all left happy. Nicely done!"}
{"text":"Ravi Soups is one of my favourite places to eat in Toronto. You get a very high quality meal for under $15. Their food is all full of amazing flavours and incredible value considering the quality of the ingredients.

I have tried pretty much everything on the menu but my favourite soup/wrap combo is the Curried Apricot & Lentil Soup with the Curried Lamb wrap. It doesn't get better than that! If you love mushroom soup definitely try their Porcini Mushroom soup.

A soup/wrap combo is the best value and will cost $10.99 plus tax. They offer takeout, or you can eat there. The patio is really nice in the summer months!

Here is my blog review on them if you are interested: http://www.cheapdude.com/food/ravi-soups/"}
{"text":"I had the corn chowder. First off I would consider it more of a bisque than a chowder as it was puréed. Had a good flavor and spice but became a bit boring after a while with every mouthful tasting the same unlike a chowder with chunks of potato and onion.  The biscuits were just basic - couldn't taste the cheese in them and would've been nice if they were warmed.  Plus with the large size of soup you did need to purchase an extra one to add some variety.  The red pepper jelly goes well with adding a sweetness to the biscuits and thus soup. But at close to $15 for soup and extra biscuit and no beverage it is too pricey for take out."}
{"text":"Ravi Soups is well-deserving of their stars... all 5 of them! I had half of a wrap and a soup.When you get the combo you get a smaller portion, but certainly not small enough to be considered a \"cup\". The \"large/normal\" size is quite generous (my friends both ordered only soup and received the large/normal size. Both will fill you up, soup only or the wrap/soup combo.

My soup was butternut squash and it had amazing flavor. I don't know what all was in it, but I believe there were bites of apple or something like that at time, crispy onion straws on top that blended in and added flavor (even though I normally don't like onions) and other hidden surprises that added to the overall burst of flavor.

My two friends ordered an mushroom based soup and an apple/pear soup I believe (I could be off on the later). They were both great, but I liked mine best with a close second on the apple/pear one. Overall, I think we all enjoyed the three options (we share freely!), but mine received many visits from the spoons of my tablemates.

They have seating inside and outside. Inside they have a sweet family style table that I want in my home! It would be great to get with 10-12 friends, if it wasn't occupied, which is doubtful unless you come at an odd time or get lucky. The outside area has a great atmosphere and good seating options, some comfy and some metal chairs/tables. If you order to go you wait by the uncomfortable crowded entrance (see below), but if you are eating there just go to your table. Somehow they find you. They write a number on your receipt and suddenly walk up to you and say \"80?\", and you say, \"yes, how ever did you find me.\" It's like magic.

The least impressive part is the front entrance. It is crowded, a little awkward with everyone squeezing through a space made for one large body and the line wraps back toward the front of the store, so you have to pass people who are ahead of you in line to get there, but DON'T TURN AWAY! It isn't as packed inside as it seems in the front and you need to the wait to evaluate all of the incredible options and make the best choice for your drooling taste buds!"}
{"text":"We we're offed soup tasting when we came in. After trying all the soups we got the clam chowder and the mushroom.
Loved the lamb wrap! 
Soup was hearty and tasty! 
Staff was super friendly.
Hubby got the steak wrap but lamb was my favourite."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! I've been eating here for a few years and my go-to is the curried lamb wrap. Now I love it so much I can't bear to get anything different when I'm there! The meat is always tender and juicy, and the sweetness of the mango and apricot balances the taste out really nicely, as do the greens. Very filling and a favorite dinner option at just $10 a pop. I also just noticed a new (I think) location further west in Parkdale. Really glad to see these guys growing across the city!"}
{"text":"Things I could say about this place are many and all of it good. The chef is formerly from the now defunct Mildred Pierce Restaurant as their head of soup. The training shows as the soup is full of flavour and body. Normally, the chef has about two soups of rotating special; in addition to his stew (which i have not tried yet). The soup is normally kicked up a bit with some spice; which adds a uniqueness to it. If you order just the soup, it comes with a cheddar cheese biscuit and a small dish of red pepper jelly; although normally I just dip the biscuit in my soup. 

Most items on the menu average out to be around $10 taxes in; however, if you order one of his wraps along with the soup, go for it by all means. The wraps are packed with flavour and are ususally spiced up a bit like the soups, and are grilled up on a cooktop like a burrito; but with better ingredients like flank steak and brie cheese. 

You do pay extra for the fresh ingredients, like fresh sweet julieened mango in the hot pot broth; or the shrimp in the red pepper bisque. But overall, I'd say the extra is worth it.

Ravi Soups has two locations, the original location is @ Adelaide & Duncan, and the other is just steps eastwards from the Drake Hotel on Queen. The original location closes much earlier than the one located on Queen West, which closes @ 10pm. 

If you choose to dine in @ either location, you head on up to the counter and place your order, and they will bring it out to you on these awesome lazy susans, which makes for an interesting plating presentation; which makes it much easier to share and sample with others, should you not be dining alone. 

Regarding service, it can be a bit slow at times. But you need to keep in mind that both locations are pretty much designed to be more like a take-out counter, with the nicer ambiance and feeling of a cafe. Yes, they do bring out the food for you; but you go up to the counter to order and pay after you're done eating a la deli style."}
{"text":"The good: great take out place (I think that's what they are more known for). I recommend the Porcini Mushroom Wild Rice Bisque, it was really good! I can't remember which wrap I got (I believe it was the curry Lamb), but I do remember that it was pretty good. It is what it is! A good takeout place!

The bad: nothing to note here

The ugly: nothing ugly as well.

Neutral: they have sitting area at the back. They have combos. You can call in advance to have them make the order prior to pick up."}
{"text":"How good could a corn chowder be? VERY GOOD. Especially with blue crab bits and Thai basil."}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service

I finally got a chance to try Ravi Soups after hearing it for so long!

A sign parked outside the restaurant mentioned that Beef Miso Soup was one of their specialties. I love miso soup, but I've never tried it with beef before, so I figure I'd give it a shot.

There's not much decoration in this place, although they have a nice patio at the rear. In here, you order beforehand and then find a table to sit, and either someone will deliver the food to you or they will call your number and you pick it up.

I ordered the Beef Miso Soup. While the price was a little steep at $9.99, the soup did come with a biscuit, and the portions were quite large. The first thing I noticed was that there was a very heavy spice taste upon sip after sip, so if spice is something you can't take I'd suggest ordering another soup. The ingredients were overall good for the amount I paid, and I especially loved the baby spinach that was added to the soup. As for the biscuit, it was a good addition with the soup, but not something that I felt spectacular over.

Service was excellent, and if you're a first time visitor the cashier will help you with your order. Not bad I must say!"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian soup lover. I came here with a friend and ordered the fancy-sounding curried apricot and red lentil soup with a veggie wrap for the lovely price of $10.99. My carnivorous friend ordered soup and a beef wrap.

Our food came relatively quickly, and I was eager to dig in. I took a bite into my wrap, and immediately became suspicious about its surprisingly chewy contents. I alerted one of the staff, who came to the table and confirmed that he had switched my friend and I's orders. Ever so non-chalantly, he picked up our plates and switched them, without offering to bring my friend a new wrap since I had already bitten into it. Odd.

Even disregarding that little incident, I just didn't find the food to be THAT great. You Yelpers set the bar high, but you let my taste buds down. I hope you're happy with yourselves. It's okay though... I'm here to bring DA REALNE55. The soup was good; the wrap was meh. Nothing amazing here... Curry on (GET IT? *Wink*)."}
{"text":"Awesome wraps and soups. Perfect for a cold day, very tasty, packed with flavor, good textures and fresh.
Lamb wrap + Thai coconut chicken soup was amazing."}
{"text":"I needed to hold myself to not give them a 5 stars review, because I really love eating at this place.
But I choose 4 starts because they don't really have much space to sit. There are no tables, just few high chairs with a small counter to eat.

The food is amazing, it is always fresh (I NEVER ate something not fresh from them in any location).
The amount of food is really satisfactory, sometimes I can't even finish the combo (soup+wrap). The wraps are always fully filled with meat and the price is great cheap!


My favourite and recommendation is the combo: the mushroom soup + roasted pork shoulder wrap!"}
{"text":"My friend and I passed by Ravi and we were hungry. So we went in Ravi give it a try. They recommended us the most popular soup hot hot broth. Omg... it tasted so good. We both love it. When u see their food truck at liberty village area again, I definitely will get lunch again!"}
{"text":"I had the curried lamb wrap and soup special Ravi stew and blue crab corn soup I for 11 bucks very good deal. I thought the soup had a unique texture and the lamb wrap was delicious. This is a good place if you want something quick and delicious. The soups are very tasty as wel"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Ravi because the food is consistently delicious.  The value here is tremendous -- it's one of the best dollar for dollar take-out lunches that you will have in Toronto.   My only gripe is that sometimes there is a long wait for your order, but that's a trade-off I'll make for having my lunch done right!"}
{"text":"I frequent this place with good reason - they've got great food! I've tried almost everything on the menu (including their specials). But I keep coming back for the curry lamb wrap. The porcini mushroom soup, the roasted red pepper soup and even the cheddar biscuit definitely are worth mentioning. 

The service is lackluster for sure. But I'm willing look past that."}
{"text":"Great wraps, great soups and all with a really nice price specially if you do a combo"}
{"text":"They deserve the 5 star. Friendly, fresh ingredients (I see them roasting the veggies / slicing the flank steak), fast, great value and portions. I've developed a small addiction to this place. I highly recommend the lamb wrap combo with the Ravi chicken stew. The only I didn't love was the corn chowder (that being said its not something I typically order) also love the free range chicken wrap and beef miso. Get the biscuit with red pepper jelly, it's delicious."}
{"text":"Don't see what all the rave is about. We walked a long way to get here because of rave reviews. Soup was just ok as was the wrap. Place is small and didn't seem that clean. My wife did not care for her food at all. I thought it was just ok. Would not go back for a second visit."}
{"text":"So I was intrigued by the name. A place that focuses on soup? Normally a restaurant has a soup section on the menu, but not a soup menu.

I went here for dinner and loved how simple their menu was. Less than 15 total items and a few daily specials. The focus is soups and wraps. You can also get a combination for ~$10. 

Ravi's soup was outstanding, the ingredients were fresh, and the flavors were deep and rich. Ravi (who wasn't in when I dined) made the receipe's and has earned my respect! A balance of flavors that were outstanding!  I also got the chicken wrap and loved, again, all fresh ingredients, and a decent portion size. 

I strongly recommend you check the place out AT LEAST once, get a combo and enjoy the daily specials! They have vegetarian options if you need them! You'll love the full flavor and won't feel guilty or like you've overeaten. 

have fun!"}
{"text":"Have no any idea why people like this place and why people say that food is goof there !!!
First of all - the place is dirty - spoon was dirty when they give it to me, toilet is ugly dirty!!!!! Table is dirty !!
Soup is so so taste - totally does not worth the name of the best soups in toronto. 
Sandwish i also did not like and also felt very bad that evening ( vommiting) , maybe because of their food,  am not sure but i think yes!!
So to tell you the truth i was disappointed in food in abundance and also worried cause looks like i poisoned there. 
 do not recommend
xoxoxo"}
{"text":"Great soups, I just wish they had more variety. I have dinned here before and what disappoints me personally is that they always have the same soup, maybe I'm asking for a lot. I just wish they had at least one different soup  that is different every day.
I like to see creamy soups, bisque, noodle soups and so on.
The soups are good I like how they serve them on lazy Susan ( turn table). Temperature is okay. Nice side bread. 
Service is good 
Total cost $7.10
Fair price for soup."}
{"text":"Decent food but a bit overpriced. $10+ tax for a moderately sized soup seems a bit much. The soup wrap combo is a decent deal however make sure to carefully understand their combo cost structure - its confusing and not very straightforward. Ive tried all the soups and they all seem to be too spicy, so much so that it ruins the flavour. The wraps on the other hand are all pretty good, the chicken is my favourite."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for a late lunch, as I was craving something delicious and warm on a rather chilly day. We had never heard of this place (not sure how?!) but it was nothing short of amazing!

We both got the wrap/soup combo - reasonably priced at $10.99, and definitely enough food to fill you up.

Curried Lamb Wrap - HEAVENLY. So many good flavours and lots of juicy lamb.

Grilled Steak Wrap - Also delicious. The cheese was yummy and so was the sauce.

Butternut Squash Soup - Possibly best squash soup I've ever had, and I have had many. Had pieces of pear and another flavour we couldn't quite decipher - but warm and amazing and super satisfying.

Curried Apricot & Red Lentil Soup - probably my fave of the day. Creamy, spicy, perfect.

The ambience was nice and I would love to check out the patio in the summer. They also have a huge communal table if you're into that, although we sat at a table in the corner. 

Wasn't too busy as it was late afternoon on a Saturday, though I would suspect this place gets super busy during the week for lunch.

Staff were nice and food came out quick.

Amazing food, a must try! We will 100% be back."}
{"text":"Friend brought me to Ravi Soups after we worked out at the Manulife Centre. It was pretty quiet on a Friday night. The bare, yet bright, orange walls and the chalk-scrawled menus gives it a warm, friendly feel to the place.

For $12, I purchased the soup and wrap combo. The vegetarian wrap was stuff with good-quality vegetables and the chipotle mayo was fantastic. It was lightly heated in a sandwich press. There was eggplant, peppers, edamame and sweet potatoes in it. 

For the soup, it was a wild mushroom and rice bisque, with truffle oil and fried shalllots. Definitely very unique and delicious. The entire meal was perfectly sized for dinner!

The service was fantastic; as this is a family-run business that's blossomed up to four locations now, the servers are still warm and friendly. They even said goodbye as we left for the night."}
{"text":"I love RaviSoups. I always heard great things about this place and a few years back I stopped in and had the best wrap and soup on a cold winter day. I'm rarely in this area, but I always want to stop in when I am. I needed a quick dinner one night before the Jays game so I popped in here and ordered a wrap. Also a plus that they had beer! I also ordered via Foodora for their wrap and soup combos. They look small but once you actually eat the entire meal it's enough. Some of the items I've tried and recommend: steak or chicken wrap. As for soups, I like the corn chowder (has crab), butternut squash or ravi stew!"}
{"text":"Was really excited to try out Ravi's soup! Heard good things from my sister, so I went the next work day for lunch and got it to go. I got Ravi's stew and the chicken wrap. I'll start with the wrap: pretty tasty! A bit small but I liked the additions of sweet potato and Chipotle sauce, and pretty filling as well. The chicken  was a bit dry though. Same story with the soup : I liked the seasoning and there was a bit of a spice in there, but the chicken  in the stew was a bit dry as well.  Maybe I was expecting a lot but I was slightly disappointed with these two dishes. I would come again to try the other soups and wraps, however, as they are fairly priced - around $10 for lunch for a soup and wrap is pretty good. Friendly workers as well."}
{"text":"Got the soup and sandwich combo. It was pretty average and reasonably priced. I would return to this place if friends are going, however it isn't a place I'd suggest or go to on my own."}
{"text":"Great little soup and wrap place. I've tried every wrap there, and I like their special flank steak wrap the best, which they usually have. Most of the wraps contain similar things. (sweet potatoes, spinach). But the flank steak one has brie, and a nice sauce as well. For soups, they are all tasty, though they are mostly the pureed variety and I do like my soup chunky usually. I like when it eats like a meal :) The corn chowder with crab soup was my fav. The butternut squash with pear was a distant second. The place gets busy at lunch, but if you go in the evenings it is quite dead and you can beat the rush."}
{"text":"So good that I'd have soup on a hot day!  :)  I've tried almost all the soups and not one was a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch with my partner during the week. The place was buzzing but not overly crowded. We ordered the flank steak wrap and the Chicken Hot Pot Broth soup. The wrap was delicious and the serving size was plenty. I loved the biscuit on the side with the red pepper jelly. The only reason this review is getting 4 stars is that, although the soup was great, it was lacking salt. The service was very speedy and it was so nice to eat on the back patio in the sun. Overall a great lunch option. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"- Go to order - wrap (spicy lamb) and soup (butternut squash) $12.50
- Curry pineapple chicken also a great choice
- Great spot during the cold winter. Get a hearty bowl of soup. Nothing better.
- Tip - Order before you get there. Takes around 15 mins. There around 10 bar seats. No tables.
- There's a $5 flat rate parking nearby"}
{"text":"This place is always busy, so it's hard to find a place to eat if you're coming near a meal time. However, the soup is 100% worth it. My favourite is the corn chowder, but I've had a number of different soups and they're all tasty."}
{"text":"Used the Grabb app to make a purchase here and got a soup and wrap combo. Food was ready pretty quick and it was great !

I got the corn chowder soup which I had heard plenty about and it did not disappoint at all. The wrap I got free range chicken wrap, it was equally great. Fair warning it is kind of hot/spicy but if you're into that and think your pallette can handle that it's definitely worth trying

Also walked by this place a couple days ago and it seems to have been renovated so it's definitely a nice place to sit down and grab a bite if you have the time"}
{"text":"I've been back a few times as my go to lunch spot.  Unique soups and sandwiches.  Very tasty and a must try!"}
{"text":"Another Ravi's to discover - same great soups and wraps. This location is by far my least favourite simply for the interior. Smallest of em all, meant more as a pick up and walk out joint."}
{"text":"Very sad when i found out Ravi passed away. What he did with Ravi's soups is amazing. He was one of the first to make a name for srilankan talent beyond sous and being hid in the kitchen. His tombstone should have the recipe of his porcini soup. It is one of the best i've ever had. His lamb sandwhiches are one of those you will continue to think about. R.I.P Ravi."}
{"text":"You know, Ravi's is Ravi's and what's not to love. in my opinion. What i specifically like about this location is the giant tree table in the back."}
{"text":"I came here a 2nd time for take out (dinner). The service was courteous and fast. I ordered the free range chicken wrap for ~$10. There was a healthy portion of chicken but not much flavour in the sauces. The ingredients tasted fresh however. 

The ambience is simple/casual but I still love the gorgeous raw wood table in the center and the free wifi. 

I didn't eat on the patio out back but it looks colorful with a mosaic wall. 

Will I come back? Definitely"}
{"text":"My fiance and I stopped into Ravi Soups based on the Yelp reviews. We didn't look at the menu, we didn't read the reviews, we just blindly followed the Yelpers. It was a chilly afternoon and soup sounded good. So, I walk in, look at the menu and almost walked out. I'm not a huge Indian food fan and I wasn't really in the mood to experiment. However, my fiance was digging the menu and we stayed. Another great call by her (and Yelp)! The curried lamb wrap was one of the best wraps I've EVER had. The red pepper bisque I had was also very very good, but the wrap was what blew me away. After I ate I wanted to eat another one. Not because I wasn't full (I was), but because it was so good!"}
{"text":"VIBE 
I love the Adelaide street location. If you walk by, you may miss it (but it's right beside Khao San Road).  

Really beautiful communal wooden table that I want for my kitchen right in the middle of the space and a lovely hidden outdoor patio in the back. It has a beautiful mural of a flower (or a sun?...sorry it's been a while since summer) but it brightens what would otherwise be a bland patio. The point is lots of room to eat. Helpful, friendly staff. 

I EAT 
I have been back for the mushroom porcini soup on more than one occasion. The apricot is ok...needs more flavour. But the lamb wrap steals the show. 

As others say, the combo is a great lunch deal for the quality and portion of food you're getting.

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Ravi-licious. If you're hungry, get the combo. The soups suffice as a good in-between. One of the best lunch deals in the city."}
{"text":"Ravi, you had me with your soup and wrap combo!

I entered a very tranquil peachy Ravi location in Parkdale one fine summer evening. Pleasantly surprised (and actually relieved) to see it fairly empty (just one table occupied). After chatting up the guys at the counter, I ordered the lamb wrap and the Ravi stew combo while my friend ordered the steak flank wrap and chowder soup combo.

While we were waiting for our food we saw some regulars (one guy wearing super short shorts and who drove to the location stood out in particular) so that gave us some indication about the quality of the food. And then the food came, without fanfare, on lazy susans.

I took one bite of my lamb curry wrap closed my eyes to savor and make sense of the gooey deliciousness bombarding my taste buds.  Here are the thoughts as they stumbled across my mind, in chronological order:
First thought: Gooey deliciousness
Second thought: Wowza, lot of spinach!
Third thought: Where's the curry?
Fourth thought: Where's the lamb?

I was later told that the wrap is a very, very westernized  version of the Sri Lankan roti. The yam, the spinach, the sweetness, the lack of potent curry: all making it more palatable to western taste buds. I do not begrudge this castration, but instead applaud it for its ingenious, delicious coherence. 

The wrap tastes delicious. I would have never thought of the pairings. That's all that matters. However, they can definitely decrease the spinach content and increase the lamb portions in the wrap.

The Ravi stew is a hearty (very) soup with beans, cilantro with a toddler's kick to your taste bud. 

My friends corn chowder was light and airy on the taste buds, but not very crabby as promised. Her steak flank wrap was very, very good. Pockets of subtle, changing flavors: pineapple here, apricot there! Great portions of wonderfully,flavored steak! Tres good!

The wrap and soup combo is a very cost effective $10-12.

I am a bit sad that the wraps are so far removed from their Sri Lankan progenitors and the meat (lamb at least) was overpowered by everything else going on, which is a rare occurrence since lamb has it's own powerful flavor. 

If Ravi can make this chimera so appeasing, I am curious to taste how amazingly well he does the original. Judging by how friendly the guys serving us were, maybe I will ask them to make me an original Sri Lankan roti one day!

In the Canadian context of otherwise drab wrap combo places, Ravi gets a solid 4.5. Ravi, you're at the head of your class and you've got another patron in the bag!"}
{"text":"I walked in with my husband at night because I was craving some soup. First thing we were told it's only pick up now because we are closing in 30 minutes!!! I was so appalled by the low graded customer service. I still ordered, I sat, I ate, it was such a rushed and bad tasting experience. I am never going to be returning to ****this location's****** Ravi Soup."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in on a cold cold night! I ordered butternut squash squash soup with pears, my husband ordered lentil soup with shrimps and we both shared a lamb curry wrap.

Soups came in a large bowl with a cheese biscuit like bread with a side of sweet and spicy tamarind sauce.

The total came to $31.99.

Once we took our first bites our eyes lit up as flavours bursted in our mouths! We both ended up saying these are the best indian fusion soups and wrap we have ever had!!!

Hands down one of the most delicious spots on Adelaide West :-)))"}
{"text":"Nice Staff! Slow service but I would rather slow for fresh food.

Lamb Wrap was delicious but next time I would def have them hold the sweet yams (I don't like sweet in my food).

Spicy flavours which I love!!!!

Chicken Stew was good too.  Again, I would have them hold the yams.  

Overall, good healthy place to go to and good portions too.  

I give it a 3 star because its not something I would crave again...Just being honest!  But...I will try it again without the yams. Maybe I will think differently then lol"}
{"text":"I almost want to cry.... Of joy! What a rendition and twist on the concept of soups and wraps! The spicy lamb wrap was just out of this world!  Spicy and every bite was like munching on a work of culinary art. The melding of flavor a was phenomenal. The sweet corn lobster soup was out of this world - a mix of western and Asian spices blew my mind. Where have you been all my life Ravi's soups??? This is coming from a guy living in the goody paradise of San Francisco. Toronto residents - I am officially jealous of all of you!"}
{"text":"I love soups, and did a lot of research to find the best soups in Toronto. I read many reviews, and Ravi Soups consistently received rave reviews from diners. So I got three friends together and we visited the Adelaide location (they also have locations on Queen Street West and Charles and Yonge). The space was rustic with plenty of seating indoors, and they also had a patio. My friends and I found seats and we eat took turns going to the front to order. The three of us decided to get a combo (soup and wrap). I had spent a lot of time reading through the menu, and recommendations from other diners, and decided to go with the very popular Corn Chowder made with blue crab, thai basil and crispy shallots.

The food looked great, and my expectations were high, but I found the highlight of my meal to be the cheddar cheese biscuit and red pepper jelly that you get on the side with a soup order. I was not a fan of the soup or the wrap. I found the soup to be too thin, salty, with not enough crab. They messed up my wrap order, and once I got the correct one (Roasted Free Range Chicken w/ roasted yams, baby spinach, edamame, caramelized onions, tomato chutney & chipotle mayo) it tasted bland, so I chose to stop eating it after the 2nd bite).  My friends thought their soups and wraps were okay, but not worth a 2nd visit."}
{"text":"A hearty meal. The wrap was big, soup a decent size all for $12.50! Bargain. They really stuff the wrap!

I had the pork shoulder wrap (it's so refreshing, esp with the mango pineapple in it) and the Ravi stew. Now that was so filling! Esp with the chicken added. 

Not that many seats but there are tables. 

Great staff and good food. Cant go wrong! Esp on a cold rainy night like today."}
{"text":"It was at the end of the mid-day rush when we arrived at Ravi Soups for a leisurely lunch. The big beautiful communal wooden table was full one minute, but then cleared in the very next. It was as if the end of lunchtime bell had rung in a high school cafeteria and we were the only two people with spares.   

Everything on the menu made my mouth water. My lunch date and I traded exclamations of what sounded super tasty for what must have been a very long while for the patient cashier. While he decided to stick with his tried and true miso beef, I went with the corn chowder featuring blue crab. 

The soups arrived on personal lazy Susans with wedges of cheddar biscuits and a ramekin of sweet chilli sauce for dipping. Since we figured that the far end of the table at which we were sitting didn't make a stable base, the server was happy enough to take the spinning trays away. The food was great and our conversation apparently even better as we stayed talking long after we were finished our meals (but while trying to nurse our drinks). 

I guess everyone working there was just glad that the lunch rush was over. After finishing her own lunch beside us at the table, our cashier asked us if we had a lighter (which we didn't) and one of the very friendly chefs (who I suspect was Ravi himself) approached us and sincerely said that we were welcome to stay until closing since his regular customers were rarely so blessed with time for leisurely chats and he was happy to see us having a nice time. Thanks Ravi! I do have lots of free time and when I'm not sweating it out in the kitchen trying to replicate one of your  scrumptious recipes, I will definitely be back to let you do the cooking and inspiring."}
{"text":"Have been here a couple of times for their soup and wraps. Phenomenal stuff! Love the soup and wrap combo! Such filling and fresh ingredients that makes you feel like you are getting your money's worth. I had the red lentil soup with a free range chicken wrap. Could barely finish it all but loved the taste of both. For 2 soups and 2 wraps we paid under $25 dollars and I believe it was well worth it.
Not overly fast service but some things you shouldn't rush. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came to Ravi Soups on a friends suggestion, and I was not disappointed! 

The first thing I noticed on the menu (like any good starving student) was the price. At $9 per soup order, I was pretty happy I wasn't paying. 

However, when the soup came, the price totally made sense! It was probably the best soup I've ever had. I tried the roasted red pepper, which had curried shrimp, and my friend had the butternut squash with asian pear. They both came with delicious little biscuits and red pepper jelly for dipping. 

It is such a great place - a nice, quiet atmosphere (I went at noon and there were maybe two other full tables) with delicious food. It doesn't get better than Ravi Soups! I'll definitely be back, and will probably check out the other location."}
{"text":"Simply delicious.
Every bite of the curried lamb wrap was orgasmic.
I love the small addition to the wrap as well -  corn soup with blue crab 
If you in the area, you have to give it a try!"}
{"text":"Best soup and sandwich combo you're going to find anywhere! Seating can be a little challenging, depending on when you arrive, but to me that's part of the intrigue of the restaurant as there is one giant table in the back that a majority of the people sit around. That being said, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here intially as a recommendation from a friend and she did not let me down. I normally don't enjoy soups because they're not filling and either really salty or bland. Ravi's soups definitely changed my mind for the better. I normally go for their soup and wrap combo...12$ and I'm completely sasitified! the portions are huge and they don't skimp on the flavours. I had their butternut squash and the mushroom bisque and they were both so tasty and flavourful. I've only tried their pork shoulder wrap and so much meat and flavour! Would definitely come back and try other things. I've brough 2 friends here and they both enjoyed it"}
{"text":"The chicken and yam wrap is awesome. This place is always pretty busy. Anything on the menu is yummy. A must have I  toronto"}
{"text":"Soup is my favorite food. If I could eat soup every day, for every meal, for the rest of my life, I probably would. Imagine then, my unfettered delight when I happened across RaviSoups while visiting Toronto.

Upon entering, I was greeted by a very pleasant gentleman, who patiently answered all my questions about the soups - which were vegetarian, which was best, and which he preferred. He then created a flight of soups sampler for me, so I could taste each one and make the most informed choice for my dinner. Out of the options I tried, the curried apricot & red lentil was the clear winner. This complex flavor combination of sweet apricots, savory red lentils, and spicy curry had my heart (and taste buds) from first slurp. 

All soups also come with a cheese biscuit and red pepper jelly, which are nice, but honestly I'd just prefer a giant vat of that soup. For breakfast, lunch, and dinner."}
{"text":"Both got the wrap and soup combo. Good veggetarian options but I got the chicken wrap which was very delicious. Had a unique combination of chicken spinach yam and chipotle mayo.

Tried the corn chowder with my combo and it was pretty good. Could have a bit more crab but still really good. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"In the dead of winter, all I crave is the warmth and comfort of soup.  Stopped into this new location of Ravi Soups to pick up lunch.

I ordered the soup/wrap combo ($10.99 plus tax) with the mushroom bisque and the pork shoulder wrap.  Not sure if this was an off day for them but getting the order was slow.  Waited about 15 min. before getting the order to go which seemed way too long a wait for fast food.  

Mushroom bisque was meh...chock full of mushrooms but not at all creamy.  Pork wrap was pretty good - I liked the tangy chutney in there.

I would pass on coming back.  Service was too slow and price point was too high.  There are definitely other options for a cozy soup lunch meal in the area."}
{"text":"First time going here, on a recommendation from a friend. 
The only con was the process, which were quite steep for soups. However, the small soup with half wrap is a good lunch deal.
I ordered the large Corn Bisque soup that had blue crab in it, which came to $11 and change total. 
The presentation for a seemingly fast food style place was lovely. It came on a lazy Susan and included a small cheesy biscuit with a sweet and spicy dipping sauce. The soup came in a seemingly large bowl, but it's rather wide and a little shallow. Definitely more than enough food for me. The soup was amazing, with just the right spice level - enough to feel it but not take away the natural taste of the soup.

Would definitely go back when it's cold out!"}
{"text":"Good chicken wrap and corn chowder soup! Always hits the spot. Also the table is pretty dope also"}
{"text":"Practically empty on a Saturday evening. The staff are very friendly. I had the corn chowder with a roasted pork shoulder wrap while my friend opted for a ravi stew with a curried lamb wrap. The latter of which was suggested by the cashier. The corn chowder was lacking in corn. The ravi stew had a nice kick to it and was very hearty with chunks of meat and veggies. Both wraps were okay but I preferred my friend's curried lamb wrap over my pork shoulder wrap. The portions may be okay for lunch but it's not filling enough for dinner. Overall, a bit expensive and not very memorable."}
{"text":"A good spot for fast, quality, and hearty meals at a reasonable price. They specialize in soups and hot wraps, all made in house and packed full of ingredients. I get the Soup and Wrap Combo (~$11 for half sizes of each) when I'm hungry, but the full size soups themselves are generous as well and the fluffy cheddar biscuits with red pepper jelly on the side are a yummy touch. I've tried every dish on the small menu and you honestly can't go wrong with any choice. My favourites are the Flank Steak Wrap (who knew edamame and brie would be so good together??) and the Ravi Stew.

The interiors mainly accommodate the open kitchen but there's a large communal reclaimed wood table in the back. Orders are taken at the counter and can be taken out or delivered to the seating area - it gets especially packed during lunch but service is fast. When dining-in, the food comes on a mini lazy susan - cute but a bit annoying when a dish starts rotating away due to the uneven tables. The backyard patio is lovely in the summer though."}
{"text":"I've been to the Charles location a few times now. Service was usually quick. I'd always get the soup and half-wrap combo, as you get to try a little of everything. The Ravi stew is their signature and quite good. I'm not a fan of the mushroom soup though. The curried lamb wrap is definitely a favourite for me. 

As for seating, they only have bar stools and tables along the side of the walls, so it can get quite awkward having conversations across the room if you bring a big group. The patio is also a bit awkward as it's very close to street level and cars, and you face the street (again, bar stools) and I found myself making awkward eye contact with passerbys staring at my dinner and watching me chew. However, it's nice that they do offer service and bring your food to you on a lazy susan."}
{"text":"I've been to Ravi Soups multiple times. My go-to is the wrap & soup combo, with the Ravi stew and the Curried Lamb wrap. These are the most expensive options on the menu, but worth the extra couple of dollars. The flank steak wrap is also pretty flavourful.  Portions were sizeable, and soups came out hot.

Having tried pretty much anything on the menu, my least favourites were the Porcini Mushroom Wild Rice and the Roasted Pork Shoulder wrap, both of which were just pretty bland compared to the other options.

You can eat there and be served on a lazy susan, or get it to go. They are relatively quick, so a great place for the quick bite."}
{"text":"I've been to the other Ravi downtown, which obviously had the same great food, but in a larger establishment.  This one does have about 8-10 bar seats you can sit on, but no true tables.  The workers are very pleasant and this place gets pretty busy at lunchtime, which is a really good sign.

It's not much to look at, but you will not be disappointed. A very tasty and filling meal."}
{"text":"I went here one day in the fall and it was excellent.  The portion sizes were very large...surprisingly so actually.  We sat on their large back patio and they brought us our food.  The place sort of looks like that would not be the case, but it is.  They bring you all your food on a turntable/lazy susan type thing which is a nice touch.

As you would expect, the soups are awesome (at least the one I had was).  It's great for lunch.  The patio didn't get much light and the tables were a bit wobbly, but that's par for the course downtown. This place was great."}
{"text":"It's weird how service goes down when it gets less busy, like say around 6pm. My friend and I got the right soup, but realised we got the wrong wrap when we bit into it. My soup wasn't even hot and was sorely lacking crab meat (the corn chowder). And the wrap was so messy it dripped all over my sweater sleeve. We were asked to pay later, and then the cashier left (not after making out with her boyfriend). We had to go downstairs and get somebody's attention so we could pay. 

Looks like it's a lose-lose either way here. Either you get pretty good service at the lunch RUSH or you get nothing in the evening."}
{"text":"This place should be called ravi soups and wraps. The wraps are juicy and flavourful and dare I say more amazing than the soup. I personally am not a soup person, I'd pick something solid over liquid. I've tried the curried apricot soup, chicken hot pot broth, some sort of squash soup, and corn chowder. The apricot soup is my favourite so far followed by chicken hot pot and corn chowder being my least favourite. I definitely recommend this place to anybody visiting Toronto, if not for the soups then the wraps."}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled flank steak wrap + Porcini Mushroom Wild Rice Bisque combo ($13.49) and they are both tasty. Flank steak is not my favorite but that's the only beef option available; however, this wrap is very flavourful! With baby spinach, yam, chipotle mayo and brie cheese..yum! soup is also pretty good. I would come back again and try other wraps."}
{"text":"Very delicious soups here.  They are filled with big, chunky, fresh ingredients of delicious goodness and the flavours are really outstanding.  More spicy than your average soup for the most part, so be aware of that if you don't like the spice.  The wraps are also very good here but even in the summer I am here for the soup!  The portions are also pretty large and will fill you up for a while.  I am a fan."}
{"text":"Take out in the west-end is weak. Ravi soups has made my lazy, can't get my act together, let's get takeout nights infinitely better. A soup and wrap for $11.00 at the quality that Ravi is putting out is mind boggling. I felt like I was eating at a fine dining establishment, but I was on my couch! The flavours were spot on, deep, rich, and spicy in the most flavourful, intense way possible. I could not give Ravi enough stars."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend from work for lunch.  I had the curry lamb wrap and ravi stew combo.  Both the wrap and soup were delicious.  The flavors were well balanced, with each bite I got spicy, sweet, and sour elements.  

I liked how the meals are served on a lazy Susan so that you can rotate between  the soup and wrap, without taking up too much table space.  There isn't a whole lot of seating, so the lazy Susan really helps.  

I would definitely come back here, and I hope you enjoy your time here."}
{"text":"Outstanding. 

I could have ended the review right there, but I guess I should elaborate.. haha. This was my first meal on a trip to Toronto and it sure was a memorable one. I had a pork shoulder sandwich thats is made with cole slaw, tamarind ketchup and cilantro. That combination is one of the most delicious sandwiches I've ever had. The sweetness of the ketchup and coleslaw mixed with the pork shoulder is outstanding and the cilantro just puts the icing on the cake. They also dont go light on the meat portions which is a huge plus. There's nothing worse than a wrap that is full of everything except meat

There's also a really awesome courtyard in the back of the restaurant with tables and umbrellas for outside dining in the warmer months. I was able to enjoy this deliciousness out in the courtyard on a nice June day. Just an overall awesome experience that just kept getting better and better. 

An absolutely must while in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Best soup and a sandwich place in downtown!!

I have been here more than 7 times. I'm addicted to their lentil & apricot soup served with a sandwich. 

Friends that I have brought to this place got addicted for a while. 

It's not a fine dinning place. You pick your selection from their menu on the wall, pay at the cashier, pick up a water jug and a glass, and wait on your table for your food which they bring on your table. This place has line-ups during lunch time."}
{"text":"I prefer this location over the one on Adelaide, as this one is so much cleaner and doesn't feel like there are cockroaches crawling all over the place (yes i have seen them at the one on Adelaide). 

Admittedly, the soups are really pricey and not actually their best dishes. Their wraps are actually significantly better than their soup and if you get the soup and wrap combo for $11.99, you feel better about paying that much for lunch (soup alone range from 7.99 to 9.99).  The portions are a little smaller if you get the combo, but it's filling anyway.

Chicken wrap is fantastic. Porcini mushroom bisque is decent, so is the Ravi Stew. The Corn Chowder is better. 

I LOVE soup, but I dont LOVE Ravi Soup. I do enjoy very much the Ravi Wrap and Soup Combo."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was on a rainy day so that might have affected the way i felt about this place...considering the backyard patio was not opened, the floor was wet and greasy looking, and found a tiny cockroach in the downstairs bathroom made me really go yuck. But since then, the dinginess of the place still resonated on the sunny days that I have been here.

Food-wise, I was unimpressed with the mushroom and wild rice bisque, but the free-range chicken sandwich was delicious, but carelessly and loosely wrapped and fell apart as soon as I started eating it. $10.99 for the soup and sandwich combo is not cheap, but not expensive; however $8.99 for just a soup that comes with a slice of bread is really expensive in my opinion."}
{"text":"It surely doesn't get any better than this!  

I had the combo with a roasted pork shoulder wrap and a mushroom bisque.  My husband had a flank steak sandwich with beef miso soup. The flavours were incredible!  We can't get over how delicious it all was.  Pricing was very fair too.  

To top it off, we had it delivered by Hurrier which was the fastest and most efficient delivery ever who provided email updates on every step of our order. 

Very impressed with this meal.
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Their soups are so good, I'm drooling thinking about how I will write this review!

They're the only place in town that markets themselves for their soups and boy are they good! I get a dopamine surge whenever I know I'll be going and my cravings are becoming more and more frequent as the days get colder.

Their menu is relatively limited though the soups do get rotated. As other reviewers have raved about, YES!, their corn chowder is to die for, but seriously, almost all their soups are this flavourful. One of my other favourites is the chicken hot pot broth, which adds a nice surprise with the lemon grass and citrus flavouring. The soups definitely live up to the hype and I'm looking forward to trying the beef miso.

Their wraps are also well-made and juicy, if not a bit on the smaller size. Their meats and vegetables are noticeably fresher compared to other establishments at the same price point, and ordering the combo ensures that you will be well fed!"}
{"text":"Have been here twice and their back patio is gorgeous. I got a chicken wrap and the butternut squash soup and it was a high-five in my mouth. Delicious and fresh. It's never too back so it's great to meet up with friends. It's a bit out of the way from all the hustle and bustle, but it's also right next door to one of the best Thai places in the city (Khao San Road). Come here for a superb lunch!"}
{"text":"Great to have another ravi soup in yorkville area! Solid food and decent price for the quality. I always get crab soup that has a hint of curry taste with free range  chicken wrap. Also enjoyed their wild mushroom soup!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a lazy sunday afternoon at tthe Queen street location near the ossington. i was surprise it wasn't packed but happy at the same time cause i was in and out in just a few minutes. The curry lamb wrap and crab and corn chowder is pretty effin delicious. a good size portion for lunch not a massive wrap but it wasn't small. 

im going to be honest i was never a fan of curry spice i don't know why i could never warm up to it but i made an exception for this beautifully made wrap. 

Great spot for a quick bite."}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed in this location. I loved Ravi when I lived near the college street location but this location is terrible. The biscuits aren't fresh and the employees don't use gloves when handling them. It's disappointing."}
{"text":"Decided to come here with friends after skating in the cold at Nathan Phillips Square. Perfect idea. The soup was delicious and it came with a cheese biscuit. The interior had spacious seating, nice and cozy feel. I would come back again to try their other soups!"}
{"text":"I'll start off my review with the disclaimer that I was in a real grumpy mood on my first visit to Ravi Soups. My sister dragged me here on a cold and windy evening, and as I stepped inside, I felt my already bad mood sour even more. The front area was dark and relatively deserted, with only one employee working in the kitchen and front of house. We weren't acknowledged for at least five minutes and had no idea what the process was - were we to seat ourselves? Did we order and pay first, or pay later? We stood murmuring awkwardly until our orders were taken and we were told to take a seat. I opted for the oven roasted veggie wrap, while my sister selected the soup and wrap combo. As we sat down, I couldn't help but notice the lingering scent of bleach that wafted throughout the back area of the restaurant, and the whole atmosphere of the space made me feel as if I had tunnelled underground to drink spirits with gnomes. When my wrap arrived - spinning around and around on a lopsided lazy Susan, and accompanied by a really sad and wilted salad on the side - I bit into it eagerly, and the first taste was actually quite good. As I kept eating, however, I found myself met with an overwhelming amount of dripping chipotle mayo coupled with HUGE chunks of vegetables. I got about three-quarters of the way through my wrap before my stomach started turning and I couldn't bring myself to eat any more. Maybe it was a mistake to come to a place with \"soups\" in the name and not order a soup. I was really hoping that a good meal would lift my spirits, and although my sister had positive things to say about her food, my experience here was a real miss for me. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"The combos are such great value. You get a medium sized soup with a really great hot wrap! My favourite wrap is the curried lamb- you will definitely not be disappointed with that one! It is extremely flavourful with a mild kick to it- it's not very spicy, despite it's \"curried\" title. The butternut squash soup is not the richest nor creamiest butternut squash soup I've ever had, but it does the trick considered it's not offered everywhere. For a more creamy option, you can go for the corn chowder. I've dined in as well as ordered through foodora. Both the soup and wrap travel really well- it was still super warm by the time I got it delivered to my door. In the warmer months, you can enjoy your meal in a really cute back porch outside when you dine in. Granted, it's all brick wall that you see but the fences are painted really nicely and it gives off a really nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I hardly give out 5 stars, but this place is fully deserving. I have nothing to complain about and just about everything to rave about. 

I've been here a few times and love the no-bulls*** concept of the place. Pick your soup. Order. Pay. Receive amazing soup every time. 

I've had the mushroom one, the corn chowder, the red pepper bisque, and a lentil one. Each of them was better than the last. They burst with flavour and care and a genuinely good taste. 

I hope they keep adding more soups to their menu! I'd love to try a new creation every month! 

P. S.: the cheese biscuit on the side of the soups is amaaaazing. Perfect buttery treat to a hearty soup."}
{"text":"Amazing, unique, cute soup and wrap place! $10 for wraps or soup. Or $12 for a combo. Totally worth the money."}
{"text":"Having a full sized lamb wrap and crab/corn soup for lunch. Well presented and good spice. Great location. Not outstanding value but it is quality food."}
{"text":"To tell you the truth, from my limited experience of non Asian soups, I found most Western soups I got from restaurant really uninspiring. Either they are so creamy, so salty (really need to watch my sodium level), tasted like canned soup and full of MSG. 

Porcini Mushroom Bisque we ordered during our Mega food crawl is A-OK! The truffle oil is really the star of the show.. just smelling the oh so good and enriching smell just makes me heart go WoW! I think if I am going to have a real lunch at Ravi Soup, I would have order the combo with a wrap because eating/drinking this light soup alone will be too light a lunch for me. (OK, I guess I can always have dessert after!)

The patio at the back for sure is a nice place for a leisure lunch during a nice day. I found inside is a little stuffy and steamy...(maybe from the steam of all these soup warming up on the stoves)

However, I can find myself dropping by on a cold freezing snowy winter afternoon for some warm comfort soup......hmmmmm"}
{"text":"Excellent mushroom and wild rice bisque And curried apricot and red lentil!! Awesome communal setting as well. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick bite to eat then give this place a go. It is the ultimate comfort food...wrap and hearty soups for under $20 you can get a very filling meal. 

My personal favorite is the curried lamb and crab bisque combo. The broth based soups not as much but I guess that just comes down to personal preference."}
{"text":"omg the lamb wrao was so Good and I get addicted to it. It goes well with my butyernuts soup."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place!!!! Granted I have only been here once, but wow did it leave an impression on me. From the outside, it looks like a quick, fast-food takeout type of joint - don't be deceived! Go past the counter area and there is a beautiful, wooden communal dining table and further past that a quaint, hidden, little patio. I had done the \"half wrap, half soup\" combo l.  Being new, I wanted to try a few things off the menu. The chicken hot pot soup does not disappoint! This has to be one of the best soups I have ever had in my life! For being \"half\" a soup, it was a hearty size, so much in fact that I ended up taking my steak wrap to go (which also looked like a full wrap, not a half wrap). I ate the steal wrap at home, which was packed with meat, yams and grilled veggies. Also very good, but the soup took the cake (pardon the pun).  Both these items cost me just over $12 with tax. The food is healthy, hearty and packed with flavour! This spot is now my treat to myself, the only problem is I'm so in love with the chicken hot pot soup, I can't bring myself to order anything else off the menu! (Although I hear the Ravi stew is just divine!)"}
{"text":"Got the combo: flank steak wrap & corn chowder with blue crab $15. Soup was interesting but ultimately not quite my taste. However, the wrap was awesome!! Steak cooked perfectly and they were very generous with the portion. People were super nice, they have one giant table that looks like it was cut from a tree which is pretty cool and could be used for a large group."}
{"text":"I love soup and Ravi Soups has been on my radar for a while. My girlfriend and I headed here yesterday because we were close by... she was a little put off by the outside appearance but based on good reviews I decided I still wanted to try it. I'm glad we did because it was delicious. I got the beef stew, she got he corn chowder. We were both blown away and will for sure come back. Sad that Foodora doesn't deliver to my area of Toronto because I would definitely be a regular custy... that means customer"}
{"text":"The place serves up wraps and soups that are unique and original. It's a compact menu and the food is pretty much as good as it gets as far as food goes - reasonably priced, tasty, simple, fresh, and healthful. This is probably my favourite place to eat in Toronto right now.

Apart from the food, the seating space is simple and uncluttered - some stools at the front facing out to the street; a massive beautiful hardwood dining table in the back (not sure how they got that in there) and an outdoor space in the back - nothing eyecatching (apart from the aforementioned table) but not ugly either.

Why not 5 stars? The washroom is a bit knackered and down a dodgy steep flight of stairs; it's a bit tight and crowded (and steamy) during their rush hour as they're pretty small.

All in all, definitely a nice little gem."}
{"text":"My favourite is their mushroom soup. It's vegetarian but it's soooo good! Unlike most mushroom soups served at North American restaurants, Ravi's mushroom soup is not creamy at all. And it has some spices in it too (LOVE!), makes it a perfect soup for any cold gloomy day.  I also like the wild rice at the bottom of the soup. 

I sometimes get the Ravi's stew (chicken). It's also a little spicy and I just love it. 

The restaurant seems a little small when you walk in but it actually has a nice patio at the back...almost feels like an urban garden!

 Below are the things I don't like
-  a little expensive - it's  usually around $10 for a regular size soup alone. But if you are getting a soup+wrap combo, you are actually getting more value per dollar but that's just too filling for me. 
- the corn chowder soup is a little too sweet. 
- the banana cake is just way too moist."}
{"text":"Delicious! The perfect balance between light and heavy. If you like soup or wraps, you'll love this place!

We had:
Porcini mushroom and rice soup.
Corn chowder soup.
Wrap of flank steak with yam and brie.
Wrap of pulled pork shoulder.

Everything was clean and tasty. The wraps were a good complex blend of flavors and toasted until crispy. The soups had simple ingredients but deep and rich flavours. Yummy!

The portions were just the right size, leaving us full without feeling stuffed. 

This isn't health food. There's a good bit of oil and salt in the soups and in the sauces in the wraps. That said, it's not overwhelming.

There's not much seating, though they do have a small, walled-in patio area outside in the back. Many people grab takeout."}
{"text":"I adore soup! After reading about numerous rave reviews on Ravi's soup, I had to venture into the store for a quick bite! 

The wooden decor added a sense of warmth to the space. The furniture were rustic.The seating was more tasteful than comfortable. 

We shared a Ravisoups Combo for ($13.99), a cheddar cheese biscuit with red pepper jelly ($1.50) and Ravislaw ($4.99). Perhaps it was an off day, perhaps it was my  pre-conceived notion of what Ravi's soup would be; unfortunately, I did not fall in love with Ravi's Soup. 

The Ravistew contains chicken, baby spinach, mushrooms, wild rice, edamame, cilantro, crispy shallots and root vegetable. It seems the crispy shallots was fried to the extend in which it added a bitter flavour to the dish.  

The Ravislaw (salad) with spinach, napa, mint, pineapple, mango, thai basil, cilantro, crispy shallots, lime and chili aioli was also bitter. Again, I suspect it was the bitterness from burnt shallots. 

The Curried Chicken (instead of Lamb) with roasted yams, baby spinach, edamame, mango-pineapple salsa, lime chili & mint cilantro was unfortunately dried. The chicken was not moist, nor was it flavourful. 

Not sure if it was my inflated expectations or my degrading taste bud, overall I was very disappointed with the food at Ravi's Soup."}
{"text":"Have you ever been blown away by a broth-based foodstuff? I almost walked past the narrow storefront, but you can't miss the lunch-hour line-up snaking out the door. For $11 bucks you get soup 'n' a wrap; perhaps a comfort to those not sated by soup alone. 

While most people do takeout, we snagged a spot on the back patio (which is bigger than the entire restaurant). My meal came out on a lazy susan (for some reason) and I dove in with vehemence.  The lamb curry wrap was an amazing blend of flavours, and a corn chowder literally made me weep (not literally). It was amazing. Go there, eat soup.  Do not delay.

Obligatory Title Pun: These soups are RAVI-shing.

Menu Readability: Where to start? Everywhere you look are menu items manically brushed in Gerald Scarfe-ian printing.  (Think \"Fear and Loathing\" less the bats.) 

Need to mention: A communal table divides the restaurant that appears to be a cross-section slab of an enormous tree.

What this place teaches me about myself: It took everything in me not to sing the \"Soup Crimp\" while in here.

{"text":"Love this spot. I go maybe once a week. Service is fantastic and the portions are always large and satisfying."}
{"text":"Soup for lunch? Yes please! But note that Ravi Soups is very popular and is packed at lunch time. My suggestion is to call your order in and pick it up. The restaurant has a small area in the front, so it's not particularly fun to line up near the tiny kitchen to wait for your order. There are large tables in the restaurant, but good luck finding a spot.

On to the food, shall we? I've been here twice now. The first time, I had the chicken broth. Not bad, but nothing special. If you order the soup only, it comes with some bread. On my second visit, I ordered the soup and wrap combo for $10.99. I find this to be a better deal, but the soup size is obviously smaller. I ordered the corn chowder, which contains pieces of blue crab. Yum! Blue crab happens to be one of my favorites. I also ordered the chicken wrap. Delicious."}
{"text":"Another great hole in the wall in the entertainment district of Toronto. If you want a flavorful soup and wrap this is your place!

The food is extremely authentic and I highly recommend the lamb curry wrap! The price is great and the atmosphere is quaint and simply. 

Just note that if you don't have the largest appetite in the world, I wouldn't get the wrap and soup combo unless you want to try each out. 

However, two thumbs up for this place. Everytime I visit Toronto, I will be visiting Ravis."}
{"text":"One of the best places for a quick, healthy lunch downtown. It's no-frills and hard to miss from the outside if you're not paying attention, but seek it out! 

Ravi has a good selection of soups and wraps, but my go-to is the Ravi Stew. A hearty tomato-based broth full of shredded chicken, sweet potato, veggies and topped with fried shallots and edamame, it's a huge, healthy bowl of goodness for $10.  Plus, it comes with one of their to DIE for cheddar biscuits - rich, flaky and perfectly matched to the spicy mango chutney served on the side. Everything here is on the spicy side, but it never overpowers the flavors.

In my opinion, Ravi represents the best that Toronto has to offer:  tiny hole-in-the-wall, mom-and-pop restaurants winning acclaim for good, healthy, home-cooked food. There are never more than two people working in the whole restaurant, and everything is cooked to order in front of you. I'll miss this place!"}
{"text":"This was our first voyage into Toronto restaurants; as soon as we checked into the Hyatt we stopped in for a bite. I had a chicken soup, my date had a corn chowder. The chicken soup was full of delicious fresh ingredients. My date and I were so very excited to be having such a wholesome meal. We took a while to finish since the servings were so generous. 

The communal table and friendly atmosphere put the cherry on top of a great experience."}
{"text":"What to try?!

Their awesome soup and wrap selection. Initially I thought it was Indian soups, but I soon realize their soups are from Sri Lanka after I read up on the origin of the restaurant afterwards. Started by a guy named Ravi, he slowly but surely made a name for himself in this arena. 

We tried the curry apricot and lentil soup and the beef miso soup. Because we ordered the soup and wrap special, we get half of each full order. The wraps we got were roasted pork shoulder and free range chicken. I thought the soups were very flavourful and rich. Enough for a full meal if you're having with the wrap or if you want a quick snack, the soup will do. The wraps were huge in my opinion! I honestly think the soup and wrap special is enough to feed two ppl comfortably. They make it right on the spot and they heat the wrap up on the pan to seal the wrap. 

It's interesting how they serve their soups and wraps on a lazy Susan or a turntable. Maybe there's a special meaning to the way the food is served. But i thought it moved too much when I tried to scoop the soup. I didn't like the lazy Susan too much so I took my food off the lazy Susan altogether! Perhaps serving it on a serving tray made more sense and it's less weight to carry around all the time...let alone, takes up less space in the kitchen!

Last tip?

If it's not too cold, dine in the patio out in the back of the restaurant. The patio has a very colourful backdrop and the patio is tucked away between buildings so you get a sense of privacy and peace in such a busy downtown neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"My husband and I fell in love with the food here after trying it once! Everything we've tried on the menu has been amazing and it is hard for me to even pick out a favorite soup. So happy to find such a gem near our place. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Went here once and it was nice. I have never been to a soup kitchen, but this one reminds me of what I think one would look like. From what I can tell they have a large array of soups.

I had the corn chowder and it was yumm. Got it in their special  with a wrap, the lamb one and it was delicious! A little on the expensive side for lunch though, $13 after tax. I am usually a bit wary of salty soups, but the chowder was not salty at all!

But, the tiny patio on the back is pretty cool with neat orange sun mural. Definitely one of the cooler places in Toronto."}
{"text":"This was an absolutely delicious, hearty and affordable lunch!

Had the curried lamb wrap and the Ravi stew. We're just visiting for the weekend but I may come back.

Also, nice cozy little place to sit with friends. Would recommend to others!"}
{"text":"Having heard great things about Ravi Soup, I came for dinner one day. I was a little surprised to see that it was almost deserted, but perhaps this is a more popular spot for lunch and take-out. Undeterred, I ordered two soup combos to share. In total, I tried the following:

Porcini Mushroom Wild Rice Bisque - this was my favourite soup of the two I tried. It was rich with mushroom flavours, yet not very heavy because it wasn't super creamy. I love a good mushroom bisque and this definitely hit the spot.

Corn Chowder - certainly a heartier choice of the two, this one is filled with blue crab, thai basil, and garnished with crispy shallots. I think I would get full if I just had this and a biscuit on the side

Roasted Free Range Chicken wrap - with roasted yams, baby spinach, edamame, caramelized onions, tomato chutney & chipotle mayo. I love the combination of roasted yam and edamame in the wraps (I think the put this in almost every other wrap). The chicken itself wasn't very memorable, but the chipotle mayo was quite delicious.

Flank Steak Wrap - with roasted yams, baby spinach, caramelized onions, mushrooms, edamame, brie, and chipotle mayo. This was my favourite item- I like it better than any of the soup here. The portion is enormous, sure to make anyone full. I saved half of my wrap for lunch next day and it was still very delicious. I have since been back to order this for takeout. I would highly recommend!

All in all, Ravi Soup is a great cheaper eats option in the Entertainment district!"}
{"text":"Unimpressed. the wrap (grilled chicken) had a strange flavour, and the soup ( mushroom bisque) was super watery and tasted like something that came out of a can. Unfortunately this was not my first disappointing dining experience with Ravi Soups which makes me wonder how they've been around for so long"}
{"text":"Favorite lunch spot!!! 
My all time favorite, their pork shoulder wrap; they put Shanghai bakchoi in it and sweet mangos, love the contrast in texture and sweetness! My go to wrap whenever I go. 

All time favorite soup, their chicken hot pot stew. I honestly don't know what's in their soup base but the soup has a white creamy ( I'm sure it's not cream) look to it. 

Last but not least, man oh man, their biscuit is to die for. If you think red lobster has a good biscuit, you've never tried the biscuits at Ravi's. Pleas get this if you ever visit. It doesn't come with a combo but you will get one if you get a full size soup.  So order it on the side if you get a combo lol. 

Again, a great lunch spot, a must visit!"}
{"text":"Why they have a dine-in option boggles the mind a little. I never see anyone here. Take it to go. The food is worth it! The lamb wrap is dyn-o-mite!!! Never been let down by a soup either. Good food to go, call ahead."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick meal after a tiring day of travel. I had the Ravi stew. It was one of the best soups I've ever had. It was full of chicken, vegetables, and rice in a light curry flavored broth-hearty enough to be a meal on its own. My boyfriend had the chicken wrap and beef miso soup, both of which he said were delicious."}
{"text":"Simply idea. But great soups and wraps. Service was fast and friendly. Price is reasonable for the location. Will come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Love Ravi Soups - especially on these chilly/cold Canadian days...

Been coming here for years now.

ATMOSPHERE: Casual and very hipster. It's a small space with a few small tables and one big wooden communal table. Decorations are rustic. The food comes served - as you can see in photos - on a wooden lazy susan, which is fun, but on occasion you get a dud and it spins as you're trying to eat a dripping wrap, or soup... 

There's a small patio in the back is available on warmer days. This place is always packed! There's often a long take-out line. But they're super fast & the you'll get your food in no time.

SERVICE: Service is always quick and efficient - despite the long line at the counter. Order over the counter, and then grab a seat if you're dining in. They bring the food to you. Self serve water.

PRICE: Very affordable for generous portions. Large helping of Soups or a Wrap range from $7.99-$8.99. If you're very hungry then get the soup AND wrap combo. 

FOOD: I love their intense flavours. Some border on spicy/hot. If you're one who prefers milder and subtler flavours  - Ravi may not be your cup of tea/soup. :P

If you order soup on it's own, it comes with this awesome flaky scone, with red pepper jelly on the side (a lovely complement to their soups).


I'm definitely a repeat customer here!"}
{"text":"I wrote over three years ago that I would bump this to a five star after having more than just their chowder. 

I've had so much more than just their chowder so many times now, I feel like a jerk for not giving them the five stars they deserve. Their chicken hot pot and mushroom bisque are also excellent options, but the chowder is still my SBFF (Soup Best Friend Forever). 

If you're really hungry, get the wrap and soup combo, it's a steal at $12."}
{"text":"Oh Ravi how you make winters more enjoyable!!! 
I have a hard time enjoying their amazing soups in the summer months even with their awesome patio out back but during the winter months its a totally different story.
I find myself dreaming of their amazing soups and hearty wraps.
Now although I have tried almost everything that Ravi has to offer I always find myself going back to my original order which turned out to be perfection. You really can't go wrong with the Corn Chowder with Blue Crab & Thai Basil along with the Curried Beef wrap with roasted yams, baby spinach, mango pineapple salsa, lime chili & mint cilantro and if you disagree with me we'll have trouble getting along.

Thank you Ravi for the many awesome warm meals that keep me enjoying these winter months."}
{"text":"I've been to Ravi Soups over the years a few times and I recently came again to get some hot soup this week as I'm getting over a cold. Decided to get Ravi's Stew. Nice hot broth with roasted chicken, spinach, mushrooms, edamame, roasted yams, crispy shallots and vegetables. Good and hearty big bowl of soup on a chilly fall day. Price for a bowl of soup was 9.99 and it came with a biscuit as well. I was able to beat the lunch crowd as it got super busy with long lineups. Seating at this location is limited, only about 10 seats. Service is great and friendly."}
{"text":"Writing this review WHILE eating my soup :P

Went back today, SO GOOD! I decided to just get a soup this time because the soup and wrap combo was too filling for me. I ordered the beef miso soup (9.99) thinking it was a little pricey for soup but it's definitely worth it! WARNING IT'S SPICY!!!! Huge portion and generous amounts of all ingredients- literal hunks of beef inside! So so so good. I need to go back and try ALL the soups.

The girl that works there is also super super nice I'm not sure her name but she's awesome :)"}
{"text":"Excellent soup

{"text":"Excellent excellent excellent! Love this place!!!

Pricing is good
Service is prompt
Great tasty food"}
{"text":"Consistently good!
Finger licking, lip smacking, wholesome healthy filling food. 
Our 3rd visit here- quick dinner before expendable-3; we had free range chicken wrap & butternut squash soup.......both were very good"}
{"text":"What a pleasant and fun surprise!  The place was packed.  You ordered your food in a long line up, sat down at a shared table in a issakaya style, you acknowledged your location when the staff yelled out your number, then you got to enjoy a tasty meal.  I recommend the soup and wrap combo.   We thought the chicken was better than the lamb.  The soups were hearty and comforting."}
{"text":"Food ****1/2
Service ***1/2
Ambiance *

Great fast casual / takeout spot.  Their wrap and soups are delicious.   They're hearty, full of delicious meats and veggies (they have veggie options)

My two top choices are the Ravi Stew which has roasted chicken in it.  I also regularly get the flank steak with hot sauce which has spinish, brie, steal, yams, mushrooms and more.   

If you were to make something at home and not scimp on the good incredients, save time and just go to Ravis!"}
