{"text":"I don't think Steep&Brew separates itself enough from a place like Starbucks. I know Starbucks gets a lot of crap for burned coffee/bad beans, but I don't think you can insert the name of a local coffee shop and expect everything to be better. 

Steep&Brew just doesn't really seem to have something for me. I didn't like their espresso enough (not really a surprise in the world of espresso) and they didn't have an enormous selection of food.

All else aside, the sticky buns are great when they are warm and sticky and the mochas/lattes will tide you over when you need a fix of caffeine."}
{"text":"Best coffee in Madison.  Service was excellent.  Ordered a French Press coffee it tasted  delicious and foamy.  Location is great for people watching."}
{"text":"In response to the one girl complaining about not getting any foam on her latte, lattes aren' supposed to come with foam.  If you want foam then you order a cappuccino.

Anyways, I've been there a few times.  I feel like the baristas there are kind of akward, well, ordering there in general is akward though I like the layout of the place in general.  Many of the tables tip side to side but there are lots of outlets, music isn't too loud, and you can usually find a place to sit.

I dislike their glass cups and feel like they lose a lot of heat that way.  However, their ice tea is very good and it is hard to find good iced tea downtown.

I only give them an A-OK because there are better cafes around but as far as state street I'd rather go to steep n brew than espresso royale or some more expensive others.  Their coffee is pretty decent too and the price isn't too bad.

Also, many clientele are sketchy, especially in summer.  Something about steep n brew really reels them in.

If you really want great coffee you should simply avoid state street and hit up Barriques, EVP, or electic earth."}
{"text":"BEST COFFEE IN MADISON!  After returning from Italy with a significant addiction to espresso, I discovered that all espresso is not created equal in the US!  The espresso in Italy was so smooth that I consistently drank it straight with no sugar.  Back here, espresso tends to be excessively bitter and weaker.  It seems that most coffee shops split shots, which forces twice as much water through the same amount of coffee making the espresso much weaker.  Steep & Brew not only has a consistently excellent roast (it's been bitter a few times but I'd still give them a 95% for consistency) but they also serve a straight shot.  Frankly, you are getting more for your money AND better coffee.  They have an excellent selection of coffees and will  brew a cup of whichever variety you desire.  Their tea selection is also very diverse and attention is paid to proper steeping times.  Complete with a nice sitting area with room to read, meet a friend or study with a group, it's hard to beat this locally owned coffee shop!

To sum things up:  excellent coffee, great selection, best espresso in town and a very friendly staff.  Support local businesses!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the attraction is about this place...other than the location.  Just not good espresso drinks."}
{"text":"Great service and great coffee! My favorite coffeehouse on State Street!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for some flavored ice coffee over the weekend.  The barista went out of her way to make sure our drinks had enough syrup added.  So no complaints on the coffee portion of our visit ... until using the coffee bar.  The coffee bar was rather dirty.  They had simple syrup sweetener available that looked like it was years old with crystals  on the bottom.  They provide a water jug with plastic cups... but I couldn't tell which cups were clean.  

Before leaving we used the bathroom, the upstairs smelled horrible like BO and uncleaned bathrooms.  The decor of the upstairs and the bathroom left much to desire, it felt uninviting and out dated.

For our next Sunday Stroll on State street, I think we'll try one of the other coffee shops."}
{"text":"Good coffee, friendly staff, and free wifi make this State Street joint  nice place to relax, study, or kill a few hours."}
{"text":"One thing that I forget about University towns is that it's totally ok to be a bum and waste hours of your life away in coffee shops. I'll remember this again soon enough. I tried to train myself to get back into that mindset when I recently visited WI. Though I decided against attending UWisc in the fall, I am quite envious that they have this fine place here. It reminded me of the higher-end places back in the Bay Area. They pulled a mean espresso and they also do per-cup drip coffees. The furniture is excellently comfy as well...I almost finished an incredibly long book while I was there because I comfortably lost track of time."}
{"text":"Average coffee. Tried the Guatemala Noir. Smooth but low on flavor."}
{"text":"Great coffee, laid back atmosphere.  Lots of seating.  Quiet.  It's an almost perfect coffeeshop.  (Only thing that would make it better on my list would be if it was just a little more hippie and counterculture... but that's just me.)

They have a large collection of travel and stainless coffee mugs.  

If I lived in Madison this would definitely be one of my hangouts."}
{"text":"Another classic college town coffee shop on State Street, this one is part of a small local chain that has a special devotion to their wide variety of exotic coffees.  Long and narrow, you step up to a smaller split-level room in the back hung with paintings by local artists."}
{"text":"Steep & Brew is that middling playoff team that's never going to be in the elite but that's not in the basement, either. I like it, but there are better options in town. One problem is the decor. The tables have that Ikea showroom quality to them, and I wish they'd spend a little more to upgrade them to wood. When I have a cup of coffee, I want to feel like I'm taking a break from industrial office furniture, not going to an extension of it. The food and stuff is fine but nothing super special."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, great tasting coffee in the morning. I also think it's one of the only places that's open early in the morning. It's also child friendly if you have a 1 year old."}
{"text":"Met my honey here on our very first date :) But - had some orange dreamsicle latte that was disgusting and it was also very very quiet in there - no music and tons of people studying, so it felt like a library. We had to leave just so we could talk."}
{"text":"Had to write to update on how awesome this place is....came here and actually decided to spend some time in the shop and do my homework. 

First can I just say that their wifi is awesome. Don't even bother going to Starbucks because it's dreadfully slow. This place on the other hand - top notch. 

Second, when you order drinks in store you get them in really cool glass cups with handles. I'm really sad I forgot to take a picture of them because they are so cool. I'm thinking of buying (or stealing? Just kidding...maybe.) a set for my apartment. 

I had the Chai Tea Latte and it was delish. My friend had a cookie and said it was not up to her standards but she has pretty high cookie standards so that's no surprise. 

All in all, this place rocks. You go, Steep & Brew."}
{"text":"This is definitely one the best places to get coffee in Madison. I almost never hang out in coffee shops, and yet I've spent many hours studying in Steep & Brew throughout the years. The atmosphere is perfect for meeting up with friends to study or hang out. It's quiet and laid back, but not so quiet that you'll be uncomfortable. They've got 4 different sections you can sit in (including outside) which all have pretty comfortable chairs.

I love the fact that you can get a quart-sized cup of coffee here for a dollar or two. They've got plenty of other drinks on the menu as well. Everything tastes really good, comes in massive portions, and is dirt-cheap. And unlike a lot of coffee shops on State Street, they actually take credit cards."}
{"text":"This is my first time to Steep & Brew. I got a caramel latte, iced (I'm a child of the suburbs, give me a break) 

On first impulse, it seems like the espresso isn't the greatest, or at least in comparison to Starbucks down the street. 

On the other hand, it seems like a place that's a lot easier to study than Starbucks. It's much less clustered and busy, which is big if you're trying to do some reading. 

I'd rather give this place a 3.5/5 than just a 3/5, but it's closer to a 3 than a 4 for me. 

Also, if you're in the mood for some soft-rock slow jams, this is your joint."}
{"text":"God how I miss this place!  Any time I'm visiting home on State Street I'll get my caffeine fix here.  It's the perfect atmosphere to get some studying done, grab a cup of coffee if you're in a hurry, or have long, intellectual conversations about whether or not American's can be persuaded to change milk brands because of TV-induced fear.  

The environment is cozy and dark, but not to the point where you'll find people passed out  face down in their books.  The coffee is excellent and they have a lot of choices at very reasonable prices.  They should hold coffeeshop owner conferences here to spread the good word on how it's done!"}
{"text":"Awesome coffee, delicious French sodas, and they've got some great fancier drink options. I love that they're local, and love even more that the service is very friendly and quick, plus their coffeeshop has lots of seating and tables to space out at. 

A definite added bonus is that their prices are very, very reasonable, and you can pick up their ground or whole bean coffees at nearly all the grocers in town. I'm especially a fan of their flavored coffees, which still taste like good coffee but also taste like their particular flavor. (A particular favorite of mine is the Oatmeal Cookie roast.)"}
{"text":"I came here to do a few hours of work. I ordered the cider, which was served in a huge glass with cinammon sticks. Yum! I sat down at a table upstairs in the back because there were a number of electric outlets available, which I needed for my computer. I was able to work here for many hours since it was nice and quiet. I like the way it's decorated and arranged inside too."}
{"text":"This might be my favorite on State. It's just a super chill place. I love the upstairs thing they got going on (for the most part...the back part is kind of ugly tbh), it's usually pretty low traffic, the staff are friendly, and the coffee is good. Why 4 stars?

I HATE the pastry display. This might seem to be the dumbest reason to dock a star. But I'm hoping that management sees this, because I've talked to baristas about it, and they agree, and have been pushing for this to be changed themselves for a while from what they said. What's the problem with it? There's no door on the back. Why is this a problem? Fruit flies. EVERYWHERE. I would LOVE to buy a blueberry cream cheese Danish...but I can't, EVER, because flies are ALWAYS in there. YES this REQUIRES ALL CAPS EVERYWHERE. It's such a major issue, because it's not just a couple, and it's not just a couple days a week. I legitimately think there is just a colony of them living in that case. Please, someone, put a scrap of cloth over the back. Get one out of the trash and throw it in the wash and put it up - I don't care. Anything is better than nothing at all.... And then I can buy your delicious-looking pastries. :)"}
{"text":"Mmmm coffee! I'd never have gotten through undergrad if it weren't for this place. Try the orange cappucino; it's delicious!"}
{"text":"The campus Steep and Brew has everything I need in a coffee shop.  They'll fill my to-go cup with a coffee of the day, sell me ground coffee to take to work, or let me hang out with a book or my laptop as long as I like.  I even bought a single-serving French press here for under $10, so that I can make fresh coffee at work.  The baked goods aren't made on-site, but they're always fresh and enjoyable (and huge, but that's the way it is everywhere).  Sometimes the place gets crowded, but they take care of you as quickly as they can, and in spite of a fair amount of turnover, they always seem to have a friendly staff that knows what they're serving.  My chosen coffee-shop comparison index treat, iced mocha, comes out just fine here, though it doesn't make the best-ever level.

Nothing fancy about any of this, but I've been to so many other coffee shops that can't get the basics straight.  I've been to this place hundreds of times and the worst problem I've ever had is a tricky internet connection.  I admire that kind of consistency."}
{"text":"I normally love Steep and Brew and buy coffee here all the time...however last night when I went here to study it was a really bad experience. The baristas seemed more focused on talking to each other and their friends than waiting on customers, continuously turned up the music so loud we had to ask them to turn it down, and were cursing loudly so the entire store could hear them: in a word, unprofessional. The coffee was great but the environment was not."}
{"text":"Good coffee and bakery! Back room always supported local artists and I had my fair share of gigs on their little stage. Great mix of students and local yokels. Good people watching when they have their outdoor seating!"}
{"text":"When I'm looking for strong, great tasting coffee when I'm visiting Madison, Steep & Brew brings a smile to my face. I usually travel to Badger town at least once a year, and I never seem to be able to find a really good cup of Joe, unless it's here. Located smack dab in the middle of State street, near all the traffic and shopping, Steep & Brew is friendly little coffee house with a fantastic assortment of pastries and drinks. 

I might also add that the staff is friendly, cool and very attentive to your cafe desires. 

During the warmer months, this is one of my favorite places to sit outdoors and people watch. Trust me, you will see folks from all walks of life, young and old, walking down State Street. Steep & Brew has outdoor seating, which is conveniently situated along the sidewalk. 

So, if you're anything like me, and you just have to have really good coffee no matter what, stop on down to this place to get your fix."}
{"text":"Decent coffee, good tea. The staff is nice and that's the most important thing, really. My only complaint is that sometimes,the wifi doesn't work, even if you have the login."}
{"text":"Steep is easily the best overall coffee on State Street.

I'd go one step further and say S&B serve the best espressos and iced teas of any cafe in Madison. Their baristas are extremely well-trained, neat, and fast.

Not my favorite cafe layout, and not a great place to sit if one is looking for privacy to study, but if you're looking for a drink to-go this is your place for good quality."}
{"text":"This isn't really a coffee shop... it's a second home for UW students. We were here for probably 5 hours and hardly saw anyone come or go... everyone was there the same amount of time we were.

I wasn't impressed by the coffee or the iced tea and they definitely could bus the tables throughout the day to make it feel cleaner. But then again... coffee, wi-fi, and leather chairs... served our purpose for the day."}
{"text":"So the coffee is good but the staff is incredibly loud and screaming does not make for a relaxing atmosphere at all."}
{"text":"i came here for tea and was happy to find that they had a really nice selection! i had some good lapsang souchong; i also tried my fiancé's vanilla chai, and that was really good, too. cozy, comfortable atmosphere, pretty busy on a weekend afternoon. yum!"}
{"text":"Looking for a midafternoon coffee pick me up around State Street brought us to Steep & Brew, a place cuter in name than appearance. It looks like a functional coffee shop for studying, devoid of state college charm and looking more like a Starbucks mixed with Corner Bakery.

The coffee was on the weak side, and I had to self-carafe the sucker. The wife's chai tea latte was nothing special. It seems like if you order a specialty, they'll bag it up on the spot; I guess that's kind of cool."}
{"text":"Great coffee, I get it by the pound now.  It's true, their breakfast blend is award-winning.  Steep and Brew is my new favorite coffee stop in Madison."}
{"text":"My all time favorite coffee shop in Madison!

Steep & Brew is a nice place to stop while you are on State hitting up the farmer's market. I used to study here with friends too. When it is nice outside, you can sit in their outdoor patio area. They have excellent coffee and a great selection of tea. Compared to other coffee shops, the number of tea choices is much larger.

The prices are great and you can get both a small coffee (minus lattes) and tea for around $5. They also have punch cards. After 10 drinks, you get one on the house. The staff is friendly. Depending on the time of day, there can be a wait, but it's worth it.

They accept debit cards, but charge a fee for using credit cards...FYI if that's a problem for you."}
{"text":"Another one of the great coffee shops I've spent many times in when in Madison. Almost everything they have is good, but just about every time I went there, I had one of their specialty coffee drinks (they have new ones approximately every month). Also, for those who want to start brewing their own coffee or tea at home, they have plenty of supplies for sale for this purpose. Finally, the place itself has plenty of area to either chat with people or to read and have a coffee drink. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love Steep and Brew, but I don't like this location all that much. I'm often uncomfortable here, but I really don't know why. I mean, it looks fantastic and I've never really had an issue. I can't put my finger on it. The Odana location is great though."}
{"text":"Steep N Brew is one of the best and oldest coffee houses on State Street. They roast their own beans and are locally owned. Plus their baristas are pleasant and knowledgable! Amazing place. It is my java hut of choice on State--I have been going here for nearly five years."}
{"text":"Was in town for a few days and wanted to get some tea. This was the only tea place we found open at 7am (a tea place that sells tea brewed from loose tea leaves) that was within walking distance from the meeting my husband was attending on campus. There was only one person working the cashier and she was also preparing the drinks. We were glad to walk in when there was very few people. The place looks nice and clean.

As for getting tea, they do have a large variety of tea choices. For a place to pick up a cup of tea, I will definitely visit the place again. Their prices are also very reasonable compared to most coffee places that overcharge when it comes to tea."}
{"text":"strong coffee, good wifi, lots of seating, clean bathrooms, local artists' work on the walls, and super friendly staff... not much more you can ask for in a coffee shop..."}
{"text":"Mmmm, supposedly homemade pastries!  a lil too much on the sweet rather than savory side though.  The chai was good but their soy milk was wierd.  I tasted the espresso in my lady's capp and it seemed over roasted or too bitter.  The usual overly friendly and caffeinated staff.  There seemed to be lots of comfy nooks although a bum took up the best spot. . ."}
{"text":"Great coffee, nice ambiance, ecclectic crowd, I went in planning to people watch state street while enjoying a caffeine boost and spent most of my time eavesdropping on the bizarre conversations going on around me...very entertaining."}
{"text":"Yes, I agree with other reviewers - they do brew a good cup of coffee. I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but I believe that they're coffee is smoother in taste. The pastries in the glass case didn't appeal to me too much. During the summer month, Steep & Brew place a vendor at the farmer's market square. They're blueberry iced coffee is a must try!"}
{"text":"The storefront is deceivingly small. The cafe actually opens up to two additional levels of seating, which is AWESOME. Free wifi is a plus as well.

S&B is a great alternative to the Starbucks just down the street if you are in the mood for less mainstream drink options, or if you are looking for a more homey environment to study/work in. As a loyal Starbucks customer holding a gold reward card, I have to say the financial perks of spending cash on coffee at Starbucks is much more enticing to me. That's not to say I won't be back if I crave an orange cappuccino! :9"}
{"text":"Great coffee, excellent tea, and astute service is what you will find here.  They  have a limited selection of breads and pastries if you're hungry, and the wireless internet can be unreliable at times.  It's always clean, and it's usually easy to get an outlet.  Steep & Brew does attract a decent number of non-studying people which may make for loud distracting conversations, so bring your headphones if you have ADD like me."}
{"text":"I came to Steep & Brew seeking a Starbucks alternative, and they filled that role capably enough. The interior is bland but clean, and there's plenty of space to work. Baristas are friendly, and that's a plus. The coffee, though, was kind of a disappointment. Overbrewed and burnt-tasting. Reminders of a past (and best forgotten) era of coffee. That said, they'll get a bump for the service/environment."}
{"text":"Nice coffee house with a cozy atmosphere and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee selection, great working environment.  They offer a wide variety of beans, and will make a single pour-over of any bean they have.  The barrista was very knowledgeable, and the bean he recommended for my taste preferences (the Costa Rican Noir) was exactly what I wanted.  In fact, I came back for a second cup, it was that good.  Reasonably priced (~$2.50 for a half-liter large coffee), with waffles and oatmeal in addition to the usual coffee-shop scones and muffins.

This was not the most absurdly gourmet coffee experience of my life, but the coffee was darn good, the chairs were comfy, the wifi was reliable (although there is a shortage of electrical outlets), and the service was excellent.  I'll definitely come back next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"Baristas are always nice and I really appreciate them. Coffee's just fine. But y'all need to get a handle on your baked goods! Well, maybe just the bagels ... if you don't use them all up in a day, DON'T keep them!  Give a charitable donation (all baked goods in fact!), send them home with employees, sell them for super cheap at night, anything but sell them to us the next day. I could literally hear my jaw crack/pop when I was trying to eat one. Ughhhhhhhhhhhh I spent money on that? Come on."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee joint. I just wish it was closer to my house. 
I am in love with the coconut latte. It reminds me of sitting on a warm beach every time I drink it. The smell of the coconut and the warmth of the coffee = tropical paradise. 
I like the different levels and it's a great place to park and read a book on a rainy day. Not too loud and not too quiet."}
{"text":"They put together their own tea bags based on what you order...that is straight up amaze balls. Also they are open crazy late so we walked in after going  for a stroll after going out for dinner! Loved having some digestive soothing trifecta tea after dinner! 

PLENTY of seating space! Check out the upstairs level while you're there!"}
{"text":"Of all the coffee shops downtown, Steep & Brew is justifiably one of the most loved. From the subtle scent of coffee grounds, to the soft lighting, spacious tables, and cozy couches, it makes sense that snagging a spot here on a Sunday afternoon can be quite a struggle. However once you are able to settle in, you won't want to leave and there's no need to. With a menu offering customized waffles and oatmeal, and a bakery case displaying oodles of sweet and savory goodness, you can easily make Steep & Brew your home for the day. 

While the atmosphere and food options are an added bonus, it's the drinks that will have you coming back for more. Don't let the cost of coffee shop bevies scare you away. In addition to their almost perpetual deals on the Hooked app, Steep & Brew offers a frequent buyer punch card that'll set you on your way to a free cup in no time. 

As far as these drinks go, they've got the best ginger tea in town. Bold statement, I realize, considering I'm a ginger tea connoisseur these days. But Steep & Brew's version is the most ginger packed and spicy and oh so good. Tons of dried ginger goes into the making of this tea and they aren't skimpy.

Steep & Brew is also home of my current favorite chai tea latte. Yep, this fragrant concoction is a staple on coffee shop menus, yet few do it right. The evolving variety of chai blends makes for an ever unique flavor trip, and it's our innate curiosity that leads us to try it at many different shops. Crafting the ideal chai, however, is a veritable art form. There is indeed a fine line between excessive sweetness and subtle sugar undertones, an unwelcome abundance of milk and a perfect level of creaminess. If there is one coffee shop that masters this balancing act, it is Steep & Brew. 

While chai is a black tea and already contains caffeine, if you're in the mood for an extra dose then check out their Dirty Chai. It combines the loveliness of the aforementioned chai with a robust shot of espresso to create a drink that it slightly less sweet and certainly generates an added jolt. Whether you decide to go dirty or not, the chai is a must try.

*Expert tip: ask for an added Cuban shot in your chai tea latte, or any other coffee beverage for that matter, and prepare for greatness. This 'Cuban pull' refers to an espresso shot that's been sweetened with sugar during the brewing process, which allows for a nice caramelized sweetness that supplements many of Steep & Brew's drinks quite nicely. Impress your friends and order this guy with your usual cuppa."}
{"text":"Steep n Brew has a nice calming atmosphere to it.  It has delicious coffee and a variety of pastries. It's good for taking a break, studying, or meeting someone."}
{"text":"I can't stay to study here, due to their bad internet connection. I've always in need of good connection to search for the references I need for my writing/paper.

But, this place is to enjoy a cup of good coffee and to hang out and meet with friends. Also, Fresh Madison Market often gives some coupons at the back of their receipt (so yeah, don't waste it, take it and make use of it) and Steep & Brew is one of the stores that actively participates. Nice of them.

The barista never gave me a dirty look for any coupon I brought to them :) and their motto saying: \"We ice anything\" is one good news for Summer! :)"}
