{"text":"I've been looking forward to trying Al's Chicago Beef since I saw it on Food Network. I found out they are going out of business, so I got on over. They are completely out of Italian beef. I had to settle for sausage. Not happy, and not impressed  Too bad."}
{"text":"Nope! They've missed the mark on this one. If you have the words \"Chicago\" and \"Beef\" in the name of your business, you better bring it. This did NOT meet my standards of a Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich. Perhaps if I'd never had a REAL Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich, my standards would be lower. The sausage was bland and the beef was bland and mushy. The bread was not fresh as it was rubbery. The only reason that I gave this restaurant the two stars that I did was because service was prompt (I was the only one in the restaurant. This should have been a red flag) and the dining area was clean. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"We first heard of Al's Beef on the Man vs Food and I was immediately interested.  We first visited Al's in Chicago, at the original resturant.  I was a mess...you could tell I was a rookie!  I had the spicy beef sandwich and it was amazing!!  I loved it!!  I am going to try and recreate at home..."}
{"text":"Tried Al's Beef because I was on that side of town, and I heard they were under new ownership.  I should preface by saying that I didn't like Al's when I lived in Chicago.  Their beef is very different tasting.  But I thought I would try it out anyway.  Beef was still no good, hot dog was pretty small, and overall, I would not return.  I wish the new owners the best of luck.  We Chicagoans are hard to please!  lol   My favorite places are Joey's of Chicago and Luke's of Chicago.  They both serve great products and you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Well as a Chicago native who was raised on Johnnies, Connie's, Carm's and Al's I was looking forward to a true Chicago combo with hot I was extremely disappointed with the combo. Call me picky but you cannot replicate the original beef stands in Chicago. It took me 20 min to get my combo, at Johnnies it would've been in 30 seconds. Needless to say the only thing I'd get here are the hot dogs and fries. They may have Chicago signs and the name but it's far from home. Buyer beware!!"}
{"text":"Chalking this review up to a matter of convenience and location, I recently found myself on the West side of Sahara near the newly-opened Al's Beef and decided to give it a shot. A couple weeks ago a friend took me to Braddah's next door, and someone mentioned Al's after seeing my check-in. I don't think I would have bothered coming here, but after reading about the opening on Eater and then having it suggested by a reader I figured I might as well. Besides, a restaurant that has the word 'beef' in its name must serve a decent burger?  The restaurant is located in an old 50's diner-looking building, with only some of that look carried inside as well. The space is incredibly loud between the blaring 50's music and one random TV in the dining room showing Dr Oz or some crap with the volume turned up way too high. The large expanse of metal ceiling tiles and hard tile floor certainly doesn't help quell any of this noise; and in fact it's so loud they really have to yell out the order numbers multiple times to customers to the point that it gets a bit annoying. There are a few tall stools and a bunch of two top tables very loosely placed throughout the dining area; there is really a lot of open space in here. The menu is stacked with all things meat: their award winning Italian beef sandwich, sausages, hot dogs, chicken sandwiches and quite a number of pre-designed burgers and fries. For those looking for something a bit lighter, they also offer many salads and wraps.  As usual, I kept my order fairly simple so I could really sample the basic burger offering; the Drive-In cheese burger with cheddar, mustard, ketchup, shredded lettuce, tomato, mayo, red onion and Kosher pickles. As soon as I ordered my burger I saw a premade, frozen looking patty get pulled out of a drawer and dropped on the grill, and when I bit into it I confirmed that exact style. Maybe the 'beef' in Al's Beef refers more to their award winning sandwich. Still, the meat had really great char flavor even with its overly generic quality. Copious amounts of ketchup, mustard, onions and pickles made this actually pretty good. The bun was fresh, soft and very well proportioned to this very large burger. I recommend you keep it in the wrapping as it gets fairly messy. Overall it was a bit generic of a burger, but still quite good and I would even consider going back to try one of their more adventurous offerings.  The fries were really good; natural cut with some crispy skin pieces, all cooked well. The portion you get with the small size was sufficient for the burger, but I would consider ordering the large next time just to eat more. This was all quite shocking for what I was expecting when I saw that patty, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. I'm sure the quality of beef in the Italian sandwich and some other items might be a bit better, but for $11.72 with fries and a drink I wasn't too upset about this. That price point might be a little high as many like to keep their burgers well below the $10 mark, but for the overall size and decent quality of this, it's not so bad."}
{"text":"The most disgusting Italian beef i ever had it taste like shredded fatty beef jerky in a can with no flavor and very expensive. There was no one in there and I can see why. Along with the rude cashier/cook."}
{"text":"So this is the second time I've tried this place and I really wanted to like it. This first time here  I ordered the Polish Chicago Dog and fries.  The sausage was rubbery and the tomato and pickle were warm and seemed mushy like they wernt fresh!  The second time, I figured, ehh, I'll give it a whirl, probably got them on an off day!  Geez louise!  It sucked again!  Fries were stale and the Beef sandwich had zero flavor and just kinda meh!  Not worth finishing but Im not big on wasting food so I ate it!  I wont go back, sorry Al's Beef!"}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly staff.  Another great WiFi location where I can eat and work.  Businesses that don't include WiFi these days are missing opportunities.  I'm glad these guys get it."}
{"text":"A close friend of mine introduced me to this gem! He is originally from the east coast and told me this place is the bees knees. Very clean, nice atmosphere and great service. Smiles all around and the staff is very welcoming... The food was great from what i had. The Gorgonzola Bleu Burger was phenomenal but then again i do love my bleu cheese... I had the Chicago dog and being from Vegas, I unfortunately have never tried a hot dog from Chicago. I thought it was fun! The relish was to die for. I will most certainly be coming back to try more items off the menu! Worth every penny."}
{"text":"My husband is from Chicago and he talks about the yummy sandwich places they have there. So, It was my first time here.  I had their itailan beef with hot peppers, wet! Heaven is the word I used after I ate this delicious sandwich! I've been back 5 times now! Love It!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and fun atmosphere. It is so spacious in there! I would say that if I liked this type of food better, it would be 4 stars for us. We do really like the french fries!"}
{"text":"I was raised out in the northern suburbs of the Chicago area  (Lake Zurich ). From the age of a toddler thru the teens the Italian beef sandwich was frequently on the table for dinner.  Later in life I was frequently in the greater Chicago land area on business , and always had as many Italian beefs as I could justify.   Today, early May, 2016. I came in and got an Italian beef sandwich with fries and a soda pop.  The fries were freshly made and great. The sandwich was a great disappointment and didn't seem to be what I was accustomed to getting in the Chicago area. the price was appropriate for what was delivered, I was probably expecting too much. I will most likely give the place another try the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"My husband loves chicago beef sandwiches and has tried many around the valley. We found Al's and gave it a shot. The beef was delicious and so thinly sliced, their gravy has a strong spice that you'll either love or not (I love it). Their rolls are strong enough to withstand all the juices and their fries are real potatoes fried to crispy perfection. My husband loves the giardinera (it's HOT!) but I love the sweet peppers. The workers and owner are really nice. We stop in about once a week, it's so good!"}
{"text":"Loved the fries! The Al's Beef sandwich was also good. The atmosphere was cool and from what I hear they will soon be selling beer so that's a good thing. They were a little slow but it was the second day open so I can understand it being a little hectic.   All in all the food was good and I'm looking forward to going back and trying more stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"The real deal! Now if they could open a Mario's Italian ice across the street! Da Bears!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since day 1, opening day.  I saw it on the evening news and heard it had Chicago style food.  Since I have many friends who are from Chicago, I had to see if the rumors were true about how great the food is from there.  Needless to say, my friends are right.  On opening day, I was pleasantly surprised that the line was long and so was the wait.  I ordered the Italian beef sandwich and accidentally ordered the hot peppers with it.   I am so glad I made that mistake.  I consider myself a  regular there and do make the drive when I have the craving for Al's.  Luke's of Chicago is also another favorite.  I cannot pick a favorite between the two, they are both very great and different.  They need to open one closer to me.  Luke's has a new place closer, but I will still make the trek to Scottsdale.  Btw, I had my order/sandwich taken away by someone else on opening day with the same name.  That is why they call out numbers now.  Thank goodness."}
{"text":"Been there 3 times over the past 3 weeks because co-workers like it so much.  I've  had the Combo BEEF AND SAUSAGE and the Char-Grilled Chicken which are both great sandwiches.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 is because I am a Fan of Luke's of Chicago sausage (a lot more spicier) which is around the corner from Al's."}
{"text":"The au jus that comes on the side or that your sandwich is dipped in, has pork in it.  This place should be shut down.  A good friend of mine got violently ill for three days, may have been trichinosis.  If you have beef in your name, you should have beef available, no questions asked."}
{"text":"Thank You Al !!!  We finally have REAL Chicago Food---Awesome Italian Beef and Hot Peppers!    For us transplanted Chicagoans... this is fast food nirvana!  After watching Food Wars on Travel Channel, I regretted the fact that I lived in an area with NO Portillos, Buona Beef, Al's Beef or Mr. Beef around. I don't care that Al's came in 2nd to Mr Beef on Food Wars-- I prefer Al's flavor.   We have a real contender in Al's...The place is brand spanking new, cool graphics on the walls (for us native Chicaaaahhhgoans), and the menu goes far beyond standard Italian beef. It's tough to make choices when the REAL Vienna hot dog bun packages are staring me in the face. We will go back...and often... to check out the burgers, dogs and chicken too. And oh yeah... the BEST fries anywhere!"}
{"text":"Raised in Chicago and have not lived there in 25 years but love Chicago dogs. Al's does it for me! Always been a Carm's or Novi's beef fan but Al's comes close. Will stick with the Chgo Dog but all in all, I am happy with Al's"}
{"text":"This place rocks. I have been a handfiul of times now since living here.  I was born in Chicago and truly love a great Italian beef sandwich.  Great authentic sandwich.  To back up the sandwich they have incredible french fries too.      Friendly staff and comfy setting.  The only gripe would be that it lacks the rough and grungy feel of a true Chicago joint on the street corner.  After all it is Scottsdale and appearances need to be regulated to be popular with the folks spending dough in the town.  I accept the Scottsdale appearance and plan to visit again and again"}
{"text":"The food is so good. This is my new spot. The service and dining environment is very pleasant and clean"}
{"text":"WOW!!  The new owners of the Al's on Northsight have it down pat! My beef was perfect, as authentic Chicago as it gets (and that's coming from a REAL Chicagoan). My wife loved the fact that they've added salads and wraps. Now I can bring her more often. We were surrounded by great people, great service, and smiling faces. Kudos to the new owners.  Great job!!"}
{"text":"I should preface this by saying that I have no idea what Italian beef in Chicago should taste like, my one trip there I was busy stuffing my face with Chicago dogs from Wiener's Circle and Geno's East. So...taking that into consideration this place was okay, not fantastic, and honestly a little disappointing. If you review their accolades on their website then this place should have  been phenomenal and by all means maybe it is... in Chicago. Much like the Salt Lick when they were here, I heard awesome things about Salt Lick in Texas but in Las Vegas not so much, and I am afraid it's the same story for this place. I ordered the double dipped roast beef, no cheese. It was soggy and yes that is what I expected and love - but instead of tasting like it was dipped in au jus it was more like it was dipped in 40% au jus and 60% grease - and for the price the portion size seemed a little small. I also got the house sweet peppers, and instantly wished I got the house peppers, there were about 3-4 bell pepper strips on the sandwich not quite what I expected and they didn't taste any different than if I bought some bell peppers at home, sauteed them and slapped them on a sandwich. As for the fries, best fries, again maybe in Chicago - but here they were okay but I wouldn't call them best fries, not even top ten best fries like they boast - they were normal fries, which is fine, but again my expectations were high which is probably the basis, in part, for the \"meh\" rating - because it was, well, \"meh\".   Maybe if I had to go back I would try the Chicago dog as at least I have a point of reference as to what that should taste like."}
{"text":"Management or lack thereof have ruined this place - zero service and food has become completely mediocre.."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical about trying Al's beef after growing up in Chicago.  Growing up I would try and trek down to Taylor Street or stop at the store on Ontario on my way back to the burbs.  My wife and I stopped by last Saturday to try it out and as we walked in were asked \"What is the password?\"  We had NO clue what they were asking and after a couple attempts were told that it was their opening party for friends and family.  Being in the hospitality industry, we completely understood and were about to walk away (until this weekend) when the gentleman said \"Come on in! You are now a friend!\"  It turns out it was one of the owners (Steve) and I though it was a very nice thing to do. Now to the food.... one word... AWESOME!  We had a two beefs with sweets and a split a dog with everything.  I am usually a Luke's Beef fan by default but it will be tough to go back to Luke's!   The fries were just like home and the taste brought back memories.  Thanks for bringing a Chicago legend to Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"They have great Chili Dog's ; However Customers should check their receipts  when ordering as there were several times they made errors in ringing up orders and time consuming when redoing and redoing.  Poor customer service when this was brought to their attention.  No refund for over charging  and employees screwing around whe trying to figure out how to just price and ring an order.  ONE STAR for poor customer service and in trying to even talk to a manager."}
{"text":"************Left Disappointed ---- Just As I Expected ***********  Was hopping to be impressed............ little has changed. Same-O Same-O with New Ownership......... won't survive either. I'LL CONTINUE........going to Taste Of Chicago.....where $5.68 + tax gets you a dog fries and drink.  Better yet ...... the Valleys best ..... for Italian beef and Hot Dogs     is CHICAGO HAMBURGER COMPANY on Indian School  This place is just........not up to the COMPETITION"}
{"text":"This was so disappointing.  I waited for weeks when I saw they were preparing to open Al's. I found the Italian beef sandwich to be pretty average--a far cry from something that deserves a title of \"award winning.\" The fries were pretty good, if a little oversalted.  The worst part was I saw \"Chicago style Tamale\" on the menu and thought I would try it. It came wrapped in paper, so picture my surprise when I opened it to find a plastic wrapped microwavable tamale (imagine 7-11's microwavable Mexican food)!  They did do me the service of microwaving it for me, so that was nice.  The total for a very average large beef sandwich, a large fries, large drink, and a convenience store tamale came to over $17.  Not a great value as someone else has noted.  I don't think I am likely to return.  Two stars for the fries."}
{"text":"I love to eat here food is a tad on the pricey side but its worth it the food is wonderful! And the people are so nice. Berry the new owner comes around to talk to his guests its very nice to see this level of customer service!"}
{"text":"Good stuff...first time there the staff was helpful and friendly....they made some great suggestions...the Al's big beef sandwich was just as the staff told me very good and tasty.....make sure you have plenty of napkins because it get messy in a good way.....yummmm  Plenty of parking up front..."}
{"text":"Had a chance to visit  Al's Beef and It's better then Ever. New to the Menu is The Jumbo Char Dog Chicago Style. Fanatastic, nothing like this in the Valley and reminds me of The Char Dog Back Home In Chicago. Only this may be Better. Stop by and try one, you won't be Disappointed. Only $5.95 with Fries a Great price for a Great Hot Dog."}
{"text":"Bland.  I'm from Chicago but I never went to Al's. I preferred Dengeos, Hubs or the more no-name places. A few years after leaving Chicago I saw a Man vs Food segment on this place and it just made me roll my eyes. The \"chicago stance\" to eat it and the drooling just made me laugh. Like this. Ha. Haha. Hahaha what bozos.  But still, my curiosity was now there so when I realized Vegas had an Al's then I went for a dip. I had a regular dipped and got cheese fries for $12. Ugh. It wasn't \"bad\" but it wasnt great either. It was... bland. And for this price then I wont be back."}
{"text":"My fourth time visiting and I can honestly say I have yet to have a bad experience or meal here. I get my usual, a regular Al dipped with provolone cheese and a tamale, and the beef sandwich is ALWAYS juicy, warm, and flavorful. Did I mention how much meat they pack in the sandwich??? I can only imagine how much is in a\"Big Al\"... LOLOL.  The only downside to this establishment is that it's not closer to where I live..."}
{"text":"Had beef sandwich.  They say it's #1. Where? Not chicago I should know I'm from Chicago.  They don't even cook their beef. The counter person said it comes frozen from food distributor! ! Really? Wtf. This was the worse Italian beef I had. Juice was all fat.  No flavor. Please learn how to cook yr own beef and sell a good product.  This is garbage what happened here?"}
{"text":"Had a quick bite with my wife here at Al's.  The place has a subdued lighting and fast food atmosphere offering a delightful combos with fries and drinks as well as ala carte menu of beef dip, burgers and hotdogs popular to the Chicago folks and crowd wanting authentic Chicago dogs. We love every bite of the Chicago hotdog esp the ones with chili and cheese. The beef dip sandwiches are also to die for. The only thing is the restaurant/place as early as 7 pm should have more seating area  but they had the place cordoned off as half closed for seating the patrons like pre closing the half of the restaurant. The business was kind of busy for dinner as it was  a Valentines/President's Day long weekend. Accessibility to clean tables are scarce because of that and yet closing time was at 10 pm still way too early for that purpose. It could be much better next time around there's room for improvement."}
{"text":"I'm a true Chicago girl, born and bred on the Southside. That disclosure given, I'm a snob when it comes to Italian Beef and hot dogs.   Al's isn't bad, but it isn't great either. The ambiance made me homesick for sure...a definite positive, but the beef left much to be desired. It just didn't have that all day marinated sock you in the taste buds flavor. The Chicago dog wasn't bad, and they get points for the poppy seed buns and characteristic relish. If there was celery salt, I missed it and I wasn't even asked if I wanted spicy mustard.   It's a cute, affordable lunch spot and better than alot of places that claim Chicago authenticity. This version of Al's made me miss Maxwell Street and the real thing, my Chicagoans will understand."}
{"text":"OH - EM - GEE! Delicious. Shared the italian beef (8 inch) drenched in gravy combo meal and the Chicago Polish. It was randomly guest appreciation and we got our small fries upgraded to a large for free. Friendly service. Wide variety of menu items.  Italian beef- super flavorful meat, bread is soft and delicious and you HAVE to get the whole sandwich drenched in the gravy (that is half the fun)!  Chicago Polish - also a tasty treat and the polish was juicy. Also came with small fries inside the wrapper.  Fries - just the right amount of salt and you can taste the homemade T.L.C. That went into making them!  They are the kind of fries that would go great with malt vinegar."}
{"text":"Food was good...but it was missing something....ah the beef.  An italian beef sandwich with lil  beef...SMDH.  Maybe it was my fault for going in on opening day and expecting the same consistency as the al beef in Chicago.  Yea, couldn't even see the beef unless I opened the sandwich.  Loaded fries were hella good though.   Might go back if I wanna eat light...lol"}
{"text":"I had the italian beef from Al's and am not impressed at all.  It seemed bland, even with the hot peppers and cheese added.  Top the medoicre food off with the fact that my credit card started having charges pop up on it from gas stations in Chicago days after I ate here (I don't travel there and don't even know anyone who lives there).  Contacted the credit card company, contacted the police, and will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER eat here again.  I would prefer starvation.  I won't mention the name of the other location, but there is another restaurant in the immediate area that serves italian beef that is infinitely better and won't steal your credit card number, go there instead."}
{"text":"When I lived near Chicago I only ate at an Al's once.  Not particular reason.  I just chose to buy my beef at Portillo's.  But I was happy to see a place to buy Italian beef at a location closer to me than Dazzo's.  I ordered a regular beef with hot peppers, provolone and had it dipped (an absolute must).  The beef was pretty good.  I'm not too picky with my Italian beef and feel it's difficult to mess up (I went to a Rosati's in Queen Creek and the sandwich was baked!  WTF!).  In my humble opinion, when folks talk about who has the best beef it's typically the place they grew up eating.  I never found much of a difference between beef options in Chicago.    The restaurant was clean and orderly.  Service was blase and one worker was a bit rude with a guy asking where his order was.  I was eating with a Chicago native and a guy that spent time in the burbs.  They ordered the Chicago dogs and neither were impressed.  The toppings were skimpy and not messy enough for their taste.  I'm not a fan of the Chicago dog myself as I feel there's too much vegetation on it.  If you could trick a PETA person into eating the dog because the veggies overpower the dog, that's not a real hot dog.  Just saying.  They both referred to the dogs as \"terrible\" but try it out for yourself if the Chicago dog is your thing.  Dazzo's is still my pick for Italian beef in the Phoenix area but Al's is still good and worth a visit."}
{"text":"First GREAT service but that is where it ends. I asked for the wedge cut fries shown pictured with their chicken. I got 4 wedges thats it. Okay so then the beef its ok but not great. I had it soaked or dipped as they call it. Very very thinly sliced beef flaps, much thinner then other Italian beef places. I have to say I'm going to stick with Luke's. Better fries at Luke's and better Italian beef."}
{"text":"This is the Very First Beef Stand in Las Vegas that is Chicago Style. Being a native Chicago girl 32 yrs I tell I know what Chicago style is. 8yrs of being in Las Vegas no one comes close finally a Italian Beef that taste like Chicago. . yummy The service was awesome Nathaniel and Johnny were so AWESOME!!! LOVE THIS PLACE ITS LIKE HOME"}
{"text":"Wow! I'm so glad Al's Beef is back and it is waaaaaaay better! This time the beef portion is much better for the $$ and the service was truly a great experience coming from the fast food joints! I'm definatley coming back soon and I will bring my family and friends as well! Thanks for re-opening Al's Beef!"}
{"text":"This pains me to write, however we did NOT have a good first experience. And after my extreme excitement about the opening, I'm extra disappointed!  My husband went to pick up food, ordered everything correctly, exactly as he and I wanted it, gladly waited 10 min for the food, drove home and realized there were many things missing...  That ended up being just the beginning of our trouble!  I had the receipt in hand and called asking to speak to a manager. The lady who answered the phone, Carla, said she was the manager, so I told her that we didn't receive items we had paid for, to which she told me she would be glad to give me the items if we came in to get them right then and there. However we live far from the location and my husband was not going to drive all the way back out there. She then told me that was all she could do, that it was company policy there were no other options. I asked if she could take my name and leave a credit of some sort in the office or behind the register, anything other than us driving back out there or just eating the money. To which she said, \"no\".  That is when I got upset. As a Chicagoan who had been waiting for this restaurant to open, I was beyond disappointed to be treated like this!  She told me there was no proof the burger was missing other than for us to bring all our food, (that we had already unwrapped,) back to the restaurant. So I said, \"isn't there an extra burger laying around?\"  She instantly replied, \"no.\"  I then asked for her full name and the phone number to corporate because I was so upset that my husband wasn't going to be able to eat and that as new, potentially loyal customers, we were being treated in this manner.  She then asked me to tell her my ticket number again and read to her word for word what was on my receipt. In other words she assumed I was lying trying to get something for free and needed me to recite the list word for word in order to verify I was telling the truth...  All over a $6 burger!!  Here's a tip, you are a new restaurant in town, make your customers happy even if it means losing $6 down the road rather than arguing back and forth with them for 7 minutes while the food they DO have is getting cold!!  After I did the required song and dance Carla put me on hold and came back telling me she magically discovered there WAS an extra burger at the grill, verifying that when I proposed the idea to her 5 minutes prior she had answered without actually checking!!  At that point she asked for my name and phone number and told me that there would be a note behind the register under my name to give me all the items, in addition to the burger, that were missing for free on my next visit. After all that nonsense I could finally get down to eating the food I had been waiting months for!  The bread on both the hot dogs in our order was stale. Other than that, the hot dogs themselves had a nice snap, the fries were good, probably would have been upgraded to great with the cheese I ordered and paid for and the beef was ok... I will be back to receive our missing items for sure...  As for after that is TBD. Sad first experience!"}
{"text":"I\"m not an expert on Chicago italian beef but this was good to me!  I had a Chicago friend recommend it so I had to go.  Mine was dipped and I added provolone... just how I like it.  The beef was tender and had good flavor.  I got the \"Big Al\" and it was loaded with beef.  Loved it!  It's a quick in and out type of style, very casual.  Get there when you can!"}
{"text":"I am a Chicago Guy,  Born there, raised there. Lived there over 30,years.  So when I heard that Al's Beef of Chicago had reopened here in Scottsdale, I went back to remembering the Al's in Chicago.  Thin sliced  well seasoned, juicy, italian beef on a crispy Italian roll with sweet peppers.     I had also heard that this place had closed because of problems and was under new management ,so I had my doubts, but it was early Saturday afternoon and why not give it a try.    Being a very particular ex-Chicagoan, I wrote down exactly what I had always ordered in an Italian beef from the Al's in Chicago,  on crispy bread, wet, loaded with sweet peppers, cut in half with a side of fries... and asked my wife to pick it up while she was running errands,  When she got there, I asked her to call me back so that I could talk to the order person and make sure they understood my writing and got it right.   I talked with the person there and what came home wasn't even close.   The beef was tough and dry, the roll not at all crispy and soaked to pieces and there were no peppers on it at all.  They even managed not to bother to cut in half.  When I complained to the manager, Barry, he offered to make it over or take care of us next time, but why would we bother.  There were fewer that 6 people in the restaurant when they screwed it up the first time,  So my wife went back for a refund and Barry had the audacity to ask us to pay for the fries!  My advice to anyone look for real, well prepared Chicago food.  Stay away from this pretender and go to Spinaatos."}
{"text":"I can only imagine what Chicago is like...my first time ever going and I'm in love hunny"}
{"text":"Had this place bookmarked for a while after hearing other yelpers recommend in Yelp Talk.   Came here for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon.   Exterior looks like one of those old style Diners. Inside, totally not what i expected. Yeah it still had the diner's look for the tables/seating but the kitchen area was re-vamped.   In a way like a fast food kitchen, kind of, more like Capriotti's style kitchen ?   Being a restaurant that was featured on food network? travel channel? ... of course i had to check out their specialty item. The \"Award Winning Italian Beef\". 3 different choices to pick. Regular Al, Big Al, or Al's Combo Beef and Sausage with options to add more meat to the regular or big Al's. Also the option to add homemade \"Hot\" or sweet peppers, provolone, cheddar, or american cheese at the cost of 45 cents EACH.   I had read on yelp a little before hand and people recommended to have it dipped as well as add hot peppers. So thats what i did. Someone also had a tip to have it double dipped but i feared it may make it too soggy? so i opt'ed for dipped. XD   My order came out pretty fast. Double-wrapped on a tray. I grabbed a decent amount of napkins because i knew it may get a bit messy because of the sandwich being dipped.   For those who dont know what \"dipped\" means. Its when they dip the entire sandwich into au jus or similar, having the entire sandwich soaked in juice, including the bread !   After opening the wrap, it was pretty soaked. XD i dont want to imagine how double dipped would be like @_@ i tried eating the sandwich with it wrapped on the bottom but it was too much of a hassle. And went hands in =D (lol... )  Juicy sandwich. Yes soaked bread. When i had ordered this sandwich, i didn't know they were putting a whole sausage vs sausage slices. Good and bad. Depends how you like it. Whole sausage takes up space which means not much beef. But if you like sausage, you get a whole sausage XD   As i had mentioned before, i had added hot peppers. didn't really notice it much. yeah overall it was a little spicy (not sure if it was because of the peppers or the sauce/juice sandwich was dipped in) but it wasnt as spicy as i had hoped. i like spicy :D   Overall, not a bad sandwich. May be a little small for the price in comparison to other places but you cant really compare this place to like subway or anything. its just different. Would prefer it maybe a little bigger, and have a little more beef in the beef and sausage combo.   Service is good. There was a guy just going around collecting finished trays and cleaning up. Didn't expect that. +1 for him :D   The bathroom is super cold ! LOL i know it doesnt have to do with anything but omg its like they have a separate unit for the bathroom XD"}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with my first experience!  We came in as a party of 4, the last person didn't get their meal until 15 minutes after the rest of us sat down.  I ordered a polish dog - and to my horror after biting in, a huge piece of plastic!  The manager offered to make me something else, but it's a hot dog, that you cover with toppings - they aren't paying attention, which makes me wonder, how much is really looked over.    On top of plastic, the overall customer service was lackluster.  The girl behind the register was rude and you could tell she took no pride in her job.   Overall, very disappointed!"}
{"text":"The staff is terrific, the atmosphere is terrific, the location is terrific and the gentleman that keeps the dining room spiffy is terrific. Now the food is another story...I ordered the big Al 'wet', plain. It was drenched and so soggy the bread/roll was falling apart. My wife ordered the Chicago Dog. It came wrapped up in paper (like the sandwich) with the french fries..all together. Talk about a slop fest. Who does that? The fries were soggy and the hot dog bun was so smashed and soggy (from the fries) she threw the fries away and the bun.  She had the dog on a napkin for lunch. We had ordered a seperate order of fries and the were nice and crisp. The Pepsi was ok too. Bottom line....the beef tasted ok, the roll was trashed, the hot dog was ok, soggy bun - - trashed also the fries that were wrapped with the hot dog were trashed. The two stars are for the great staff and cleanliness of the dining room. There are better sandwich shops in town that are locally owned. Sorry Al."}
{"text":"Being an old time Chicagoan I consider myself to be a bit of an Italian Beef connoisseur so this place was a bit of a disappointment. They have signs indicating they were voted the best for years and I can only image the poll was taken at a family gathering. While the sandwich was okay it certainly was nothing special and the fact an order of fries is almost as much as the sandwich makes this place just an over priced fast food stop. There are plenty of Chicago joints in town that have a good to very good beef sandwich and this is not one of them. If your driving past and are hungry this should fill you up and not kill you, but don't believe the hype about it being a best of anything, just another chain trying to fill a niche and in this case perhaps they have stepped out of their comfort zone."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of roast beef or its many derivative dishes, but from what I see this is the place to get one. Personally I stick to the Chicago dogs and polish sausages and dang they are good and at a good price.  My only beef (har!) is that they aren't a TRUE chicago dog, as they are missing the cucumber and tomato, but regardless still a tasty dog at a great price!"}
{"text":"One of the great things about Italian Beef in Chicago is that it is quick, cheap, and delicious. Al's fails on all counts.  At this location, a beef sandwich ran me just shy of $10. Good thing I didn't get sweet peppers.  The girl delivering the food made a BFD about having the receipt, something the cashier didn't mention. So I had to track down my crumpled receipt from the garbage, and unfortunately, fishing through the garbage was probably the highlight of the trip.  When I finally got my sandwich, the bread was still cold, despite being dipped. The beef lacked any real flavor, and the gardiniera were barely present, I didn't even taste them.   Windy City beefs 'n' dogs makes a real italian beef, but it's a little pricey. Al's was just as pricey, but didn't have any of the real Chicago flavor.  I originally thought it would be a good idea to go here just to make Portillo's jealous, and maybe they would come to town. After my first visit, I'm pretty sure it will backfire, like being with a girl so fugly that the girl you are trying to make jealous just rethinks what she saw in you in the first place.  In conclusion, I'd rather drive to LA or Scottsdale to get some Portillo's than go to this place. I guess the days of Vegas having authentic Chicago Italian Beef are still a ways away."}
{"text":"I really tried to like this place, being from Illinois i grew up eating Italian beef's and Chicago hot dogs. I have even tried Al's in chi-town and enjoyed the service and the food. I think with somethings it just does not transplant well in other cities. To be fair it's not the food that has me feeling like this, the first time we came we had a groupon and it place was pretty much empty i think it was due to being in between lunch and dinner one guy was working he was very friendly and he is the one who took our order and made our food. Everything was great the sandwich to meat ratio was perfect as the amount of cheese on the Italian beef and the Italian beef with sausage combo. We were so happy to find an authentic chi-town restaurant and knew we would be back.   Visit 2 the restaurant was super busy and we ordered the same thing we had last time the regular Italian beef, and the Italian beef and sausage combo and added a chi-dog to see what they were working with. The highlight of the meal with the Chi-dog. Both sandwiches had way too much cheese on them it was crazy it was more like a cheese sandwich with a side of meat. Because we didn't want to have to wait to eat our food knowing it would be a wait because of the amount of people that day and we had other things to do we scraped off some of the cheese and ate it.   3rd and final visit: So I order my regular Italian beef sandwich i ask light on the cheese loaded fries this time and my husband orders the Maxwell street polish and a chi-dog. I walk up to get my food when it's done and I ask the lady who called me over where the polish was she said awl i thought you didn't want it. I am confused at this point because we never said we didn't want it i ordered my sandwich my husband said let me get the chi dog and the polish, now where she got we didn't want it out that sentence confused me. So she is just standing in front of me looking puzzled no im sorry do you want me to make you one nothing. I tell my husband what happened he was like just go order the polish. Now if any of you know about an Italian beef but you have to eat it when you get it because if not it gets soggy. So I ask her can you just ring one up for me she look at me and say you gotta go down there and order it. Now at this point i am annoyed because there are 3 people in line you messed up my order not active listening and now i have to go to the end of the line to order something that I should of had in the first place, I went and got in line then my husband was like never mind by the time you order it will be mush. On top of all this I knew I would not be back when I went to refill my drink and I saw one of the girl that was making the food eating fries, now i know that is not sanitary at all! when she saw me she walked over and got a paper towel and wiped off her gloves like that made a difference. Oh and my food was still way to cheesy even when I asked for light on the cheese."}
{"text":"This place is dangerously close to my gym- as in, I may need to go to hypnosis to forget this place exists otherwise I may be in for some weight gain stopping by after my work out.  All jokes aside, the beef they're known for has been my least-favorite menu item: regular beef, wet, hot and sweet, with provolone, was dryer than expected (both meat and lack of gravy) and provolone was tasteless and minimal, as to render it practically nonexistent. Sweet peppers were good though, and meat/bread were of good quality. Overall just more miss than hit.  Polish style Chicago dog was a score: thick and juicy, topped just right, but bun fell apart halfway through, which sucks. Bit too wet here with sauces, as opposed to the sandwich having too little moisture. Would get this again, or try their chili dog.  Speaking of chili, I have strong feelings about chili and usually prefer that it be made WITH beans. The one here is without, and on fries with cheese it is amazing. Ultimate fat girl food. The small is enough to share, I enjoy them too much to try the buffalo bleu fries though they sound awesome too.  Can't wait for the fall weather to get here, as soon as temps go down I'll be back for the full tamale boat with chili and onions. Service was adequate- not much personality but efficient and relatively quick. Décor is Chicago pride, as you'd expect, done without being gaudy."}
{"text":"to loud seriously the acoustics were not considered when putting this place together. blue cheese french frys means frys with blue cheese oh boy. it's not portillos"}
{"text":"Al's is classic Chicago.  We went two days after they opened, and the sandwich was just OK.  I'm sure it'll get better as the staff gain experience."}
{"text":"A lot of people come here for the Italian beef sandwiches. I come for the polish sausage. I did try a Italian beef with peppers and without and it is a damn good sandwich. The sandwich was dipped in au jus and the beef was tender. I liked it with the spicy peppers better. The sausages here are cooked just right. Great flavor and the grilled onions were a great addition to it. The fries didn't look appetizing when I first saw them but they taste really good! One disappointing and even laughable thing was the tamale I ordered. It's straight up microwaved!!! It was even given to me still in the plastic wrapper. Fail. It looked wrong and tasted like garbage. Good thing the Italian beef, polish sausage, and fries are worth coming back for because the tamale sure isn't."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great friendly staff and service. I recommend everyone to check this place out at least once when they are near to this location. Had the Italian sausage with peppers and onions wet and cheddar cheese fries. Opens around 1030 but worth a look"}
{"text":"As a Chicago native finding a real Chicago beef restaurant outside the city limits is a rare find. I've been to Al's in Chicago many times and had to see how the new Vegas location stacked up to the original. The interior brings me back to the being back at home with all the photos and memorabilia. Nice work on the decor. Ordered a large wet beef with sweet and hot peppers and fries. The prices are fair for the size of what you get. I don't really care for being charged extra for peppers as this is not usual for a true Chicago beef restaurant. Aside from that the beef was really tasty and brought me back to my days back home in Chicago. If I'm in Chicago I'd prefer a Johnnies or Portillos but Al's is a great addition to the Vegas market. I'll have to try a Chicago Dog next time! Looking forward to coming back.."}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment.    I'm a big fan of a good Italian Beef sandwich.  I was introduced to it when I lived in the Chicago area in 2001.  Since I've moved back to AZ, I am always in search of a good one.  Lately, on my way to Anaheim for a little family fun, I stop at Portillo's in Buena Park or Moreno Valley.  This is a must.  Needless to say this is what I compare Italian Beef sandwiches to.  The Italian Beef sandwich at Al's just did not compare.  Not only was the beef dry even though I got it wet, but it just tasted different.  It was definitely an unexpected taste for me.  The rest of the family agreed too.  The hype was there but did not deliver or meet my expectations for me.  To top it off, the service wasn't the best either.  It took a few times for the cashier to get the order right.  And even though the order was right they still managed to screw up one of the items we ordered.  Though they did rectify it.  And to top it off, we ordered a \"chopped\" salad.  The lettuce wasn't even chopped.  What?  Not chopped?  It's the little things.  We ended up leaving disappointed.  It was a bust for us and definitely not worth the trek from Chandler."}
{"text":"The beef combo was very good and tasty.  The fries just OK.  A limited menu but maybe that's the idea.  The outdoor signage is horrible and the place can be hard to find.  They need a good street sign"}
{"text":"Seriously, this place is seriously good. Like, no joke good.  I was shocked to be honest.    I've had Al's in Chicago and this place is just as good, if not better.  The place is true Chicago decor but the food...it's where it's at.  I've had the Chipotle chicken wrap, which is seriously good.  The bf has gotten the Maxwell, which is his fave but has had the dogs in multiple variations and is always pleased.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Great and quick service, the fries and sandwich were delicious! I've never been to Chicago, but I've had Portillo's in California and I think this is just as good, if not better!"}
{"text":"New owners are awesome!!!!!  Good people, earnest in providing a great product with great service.  The restaurant is beautiful too.  My mouth starts watering right when I walk in the door.  Go check them out!!!!"}
{"text":"This place was off the charts excellent!  I could become a regular.   The staff was very friendly and prompt.   The food taste excellent and the pace is extremely clean.  It is a great place to grab a bit and watch the sports game."}
{"text":"Food was not good at all.  The Italian beef and sausage combo was horrible and the peppers are tasteless.   Basically, if you have absolutely no taste buds at all, you may like this place."}
{"text":"So i don't remember Als beef in Chicagoland being very good. I remember when they franchised they lost quality, so I was always a portillos guy. I figured I'd try Als out in vegas after getting a groupon and it didn't start good. After I ordered and paid, I waited 5 mins and was told they are out of hot dogs. They \"upgraded\" me to a polish.  I waited another 10 minutes for my order. That is ridiculous! A beef and hot dog should take no longer then 5 minutes. It wasn't even busy and there were 4 people working. What on earth could take them so long??  When order came up the young lady apologized and said they did in fact had hot dogs and that they gave me an extra because of the wait. Good save! She was very nice. Good customer service makes up for slow service any day!  The hot dog and fries was average. The beef to me just wasn't that good. They don't toast the bread, and there wasn't much flavor. It didn't stand out. Honestly it was bland. Even the giardinera was just ok. Won't be returning. I'll stick with my 4 hour drive to Portillos."}
{"text":"What it's not. Al's on Taylor street. Not be sue the food isn't good. It doesn't have a great location and it's not a made over garage with no restroom.  What it does have is one of the best Italian Beefs in Phoenix.  I get it sweet and dipped.   And the fries. If you like fresh cut fries and I do, this is the place. Whenever I'm in Scottsdale which is about once a week I drop by and say Hi to Barry and get my Chicago fix.  I also get the Jumbo Char Dog. This is one Hot Dog. While the regular dog is a natural casing Vienna Dog the Jumbo Char Grilled is as good as it gets.  I grew up on places they Fluky's and Weiners Circle as well as Mustards Last Stand just to name a few.   My Chicago food cred is second to none.  In Chicago my Beef priority would be Al's, Mr Beef, Luke's and then a few real mom and pops like Roma's or Captain Nemo's. actually Captain Nemo's was pretty good yet not what I would call a traditional Beef.   Anyway I digress. Just like in Chicago my first choice for Beef would be Al's, second when I'm near downtown or Chandler it would be Luke's and just like in Chicago the only time I would go to Portillos is when every one else that has a good beef is closed.   One piece of advice for people who have tried an Italian Beef and didn't like it. If they had a sign saying they serve Vienna Italian Beef. That has to be some of the worst Beef and Gravy made. The thing about all the other Beef Places I mentioned in AZ is that they make their own. The only Beef I would by that is a Name Brand would be Scala. Have never seen a place in Phoenix that has it.  And is it just me or has Oregano's gone downhill in the last year.  Al's is still number one, even in Phoenix. just like in Chicago."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago and going to Southern California occasionally just for Portillos I couldn't wait for this place to open. Took my son and ordered 2 beefs (1 large, 1 regular), 2 fries and 2 drinks. $31.00, are you kidding me! On top of that the beef is a poor substitute for Portillos or alot of places for that matter. Greasy more than juicy. Please Portillos come here fast. I can't believe what I just paid for that garbage. Even my 15 year old boy said \" did you really pay $31.00 Dad?\". Fries were good but not worth $3.50 for a fair size order. Never going back."}
{"text":"If this were the only place in Vegas to get Italian Beef it would be ok. Meat was dry, even though I asked for wet. You should not have the option of cheese, and the \"HOT\" giardinera was not.   Won't go back. Windy City Dogs is much better."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Illinois so I got a mild chuckle out of all this Chicago-style mumbo jumbo. As people may know about me, I'm not really deep rooted in my Chicago heritage. I don't crave deep dish pizza, I don't have that accent, and I definitely don't care about \"Da Bears\".  That being said, this Chicago-style food was quite good. I had the standard Al's Beef today. You can choose how you much sauce (or gravy as they call it) you want by saying \"Regular\", \"Wet\", or \"Dipped\". I've tried the \"Regular\" before and I couldn't really taste the gravy at all. I haven't gone nuts and went with \"Dipped\" yet. This is probably the most boring thing on the menu, but there are plenty of other really delicious items that will help you grow your love handles, especially their hot dogs. Excellent. I also thought the french fries were very good while not being too heavy.  Now if you want some more coronary-inducing items, try out their Gypsy Fries. If I remember correctly, it's their fries topped with cheese sauce, more gravy, more spicy peppers and more beef. Don't worry about eating here. It's nothing that some fasted cardio and some weight training can't fix, right?  Service was also excellent. The staff is very friendly and the food comes out immediately. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food. They were out of beef though, on a Friday night so a bit upsetting since we had drove very far to get there. The place has plenty of seats and the girls behind the counter nice and understanding since I was upset. Had dogs and tamales, perfect! Best resemblance of Chicago dogs i have found here since Chicago Hot Dog on Rancho changed hands and went bad. Prices were great i cant wait to go back and try the beef maybe this weekend! They are more off rainbow than jones since the two things i read was off jones and no seating, both wrong so give them a try, if your really from Chi town, this place is great. Will update after i get my wet beef with extra sweet peppers! ***yep beef is FANTASTIC The young guy behind the counter is pleasant and great to deal with"}
{"text":"Just picked up Italian Beefs from Al's Chicago on West Sahara and Rainbow . Had a buy one get one free coupon . It was the worst I have ever had !!! Nasty . Most here in Las Vegas are OK but not as good as when I lived in Chicago . You couldn't pay me to eat at that place again .  The cashier and cook were very nice and the fries were pretty good and you got a lot of fries .  The cashier at first forgot to put in my coupon , but I reminder her and she apologized .  We got our food to go and when we got home we realized they didn't give us our fries , so my son drove back and they gave us another order of fries for free , but the one large order was plenty for the two of us .  It looks nice on the inside and out .  I remember it being like a 50's diner before ."}
{"text":"When I first visited Al's during their opening week, I was deliciously impressed because their Italian Beef was better thanthe one I had in Chicago.  The taste popped in your mouth and the beef was tender fresh and delicious.  Unfortunately a lot seems to have changed since then.  The last time I went about a week ago I was very disappointed.  The beef tasted old, bitter and had fat and gristle.  The flavors were flat as if someone had forgotten to stir the pot and the Giordano peppers were limp, oily and flavorless.  The best part of the meal was the fries and they were sub par. Very disappointing.  What happened to the quality of food they once served?  I wish the owners would come back and fix things."}
{"text":"This is closer to a 3.5 star review, but my stomach was NOT happy with Al's Beef after the fact (no food poisoning or anything, it just didn't sit well with me), so I'm making it a 3 star.  Big Al's looks like an old-school diner, situated on Sahara, near Rainbow Blvd. You place your order at the counter. Making a decision can be a bit overwhelming, but luckily, they have clear descriptions of the different varieties of beef sandwiches.  I ordered a regular beef sandwich, wet, with sweet peppers and provolone cheese. I was very impressed that the bread didn't fall apart, but be warned- this isn't a neat meal! With a drink, it cost just over $10.   The beef wasn't as juicy or tender as I expected, and I really couldn't taste the cheese, but it was filling. The service was friendly, and the restaurant was clean.   I'm glad I checked Al's off my list of places to check out, but I won't be making a special effort to return... My poor tummy couldn't take it!"}
{"text":"Not the Chicago ALS I grew up on. Horrible service! Food was cold, hard buns, not worth it!! I'll stick to Windy City on Lake Mead!!"}
{"text":"I love this place it is soo good, one of the best hotdogs ive ever had. I wish i didnt live so far or else id be here everyday"}
{"text":"Had an out of town guest from Chicago that wanted to try this so off we went.  Shared parking lot with another restaurant and the place was not too crowded at lunch.  The presentation within the former diner was nice and the staff seemed helpful and pleasant (for a fast food joint).  The problem was my friend said the sandwich was no where near a true Italian beef like they have in Chicago.  I asked how it was supposed to taste but he couldn't describe it.  I personally just didn't like the flavor.  It was slightly smokey but not in a good way like BBQ.  Hard to describe but just felt like it could use a different taste.  Otherwise the meet was tender.  Maybe if I every were to go back I'll try the cheese fries that everyone else with higher reviews is showing."}
{"text":"I can understand why they closed - the food and service was great when they first opened, but  was not very good our last two visits.    It seemed that they had a complete change of staff and the food was not prepared very well, e.g., the sweet peppers were very hard and not cooked and the beef wasn't very good.  In addition, the place was not very clean.  Maybe we can get a Portillo's here instead!!"}
{"text":"The old Al's was a dump.  Messy, dirty scummy place with terrible food that sent you straight to the bathroom.  The new Al's is as clean as you could ever imagine.  Beautiful inside with a happy, spirited staff.  Ordered the Italian Beef dipped sandwich with peppers and cheddar cheese and it was one of the most delicious lunches i ever had.   If you went to the old Al's and hated it, you really have to give the new management team a chance.  Much better than Casella's which has some of the most overrated food in the valley.   5 Stars !!!"}
{"text":"The only other italian beef I've had was from Portillo's--in Buena Park. We came to Al's to try it out since we heard of the customer appreciation day with a regular beef for only $1!  The line was out the door, but moved quickly. There was a guy taking your orders before you get to the counter bc on this day it was so busy. All the staff was on the top of their game, enthusiastic and friendly. We only waited a few minutes until we got to order from starting the wait at the end of the line outside.  A few--very few-- minutes later we got our two italians beefs. One with hot peppers and one with provolone, each being $0.50 extra and both dipped (dripping wet!). They put a LOT of peppers so you can def share them if your are cheap, ahem, I mean thrifty, like I am.  The beef is sliced paper thin, tender, and the gravy savory, salty, beefy, garlicky. The bread is soaked but somehow doesn't fall apart. Soggy, yes, but doesn't go the way of a saltine in soup like I thought it would. At Portillo's I always got the gravy on the side bc a dipped beef always resulted in \"saltine vs soup\" bread. Al's bread stayed chewy. And the amount of beef they put in was surprising! I thought they would be cheap with it since it was a discount day, but no. Fully packed, and a smart move to win over new customers like myself. Even at regular price of $6.35, it is a really fair and good cheap price for a sandwich that will get you full! If you are familiar with The Hat (pastrami sandwiches in CA) those are now $8.99, but the amount of meat is along those lines. You will be full!  As we left, the guy that was taking out the trash smiled at us and asked how everything was. We told him we enjoyed it more than Portillo's and he was so friendly and nice and joked around with us and said he would tell everybody.  We will def be back."}
{"text":"After teasing Andrew C about his experience with sausages here yesterday, Roger T and I had to check this place out to see the quality of the meat they were packing. I've been to and go to Chicago frequently, and wanted to compare Vegas Al's sandwiches to the likes of Portillo's, Johnnie's, and other spots I've had up in the Chi. After all, I went to school up in Illinois. Just like in Chicago everything is a la carte and there are no combo meals to be had here. I went with an Italian sausage, dipped w/ giardinera (50 cents extra), large cheese fries and a soda.   The food came out pretty quickly and the sandwich and box of fries were a lot bigger than I had imagined (based on reading the reviews). My sandwich was nice and juicy with lots of giardinera, just how I like it. Maybe people in Vegas just have never had a dipped sandwich before because mine was perfectly soaked but not yet falling apart even when I was eating it. The giardinera had good flavor and a good kick. Just sucks that you have to pay extra...pretty sure they don't do that in Chicago! The cheese fries came in a box and it was way more than I could finish. I recommend going with small fries unless you're sharing them.  Other than the extra charges for toppings, the pricing here was fairly reasonable, maybe a buck or so more than what they charge up in Chicago for beef and combo sandwiches...everything else seemed to be priced pretty similarly. I'll have to come back to try their beef and combo sandwiches and see if they are as stingy on the meat as the reviews are alleging. From what I saw on Roger's sandwich it seemed pretty reasonable but I could see them jipping you on the combo.  While writing this review I realized Al's Beef is actually from Chicago although I've never been to one up there. I'll be up in the Chi again in July so maybe I'll look for one and compare it to Vegas."}
{"text":"Today was my fourth visit and probably my last visit. I was extremely happy the first time because I'm from Chicago and grew up on Al's on (Taylor). Anyway, the food was delicious. I think I even wrote a good review the first time I came here. However the second time I went I was disappointed the beef was luke warm and fries were kinda salty but still had great flavor. Third visit went the same way, so I thought to myself maybe I'm going to often and my taste buds are getting use to the food. Well today I went after about 2 months and it was the same type of food but worse. The meat was cold, the fries well I'll just say I had fries with my salt, it was ridiculous. I got upset because it's pretty pricey. I don't want to ruin what I grew up on so I'll wait to go to a Chicago to have Al's on Taylor. I gave it 3 stars because the staff is always nice, the cashier remembered me big plus because I love great customer service. The restaurant is always clean and the flavor of the beef was good. I suggest getting a different warmer for the beef and tell your staff easy with the salt."}
{"text":"Completely unacceptable . I've been here over 10 times I love their hot dogs , especially their Chicago hotdog. I was in today with a friend and we witnessed a little girl walk up to the soda machine with her dog in her hand and let the dog lick the soda machine. Then once I said something to the girl ( which in no shape or form came off rude) asking her politely to stop , her father got loud with me and started arguing. Bottom line is this is unacceptable and will no longer be going to Al's."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago, and when I heard about this place, I couldn't wait to try it. Ordered a beef/sausage combo with onions and hot peppers to go. Couldn't wait to get home to eat it. DISAPPOINTED !!! The flavor was great but there was hardly any beef, onions or peppers. Definitely not like the pictures on yelp or what I remember eating from the Al's in Chicago. I'm willing to give them another try and hopefully I will not be short changed."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I was born and raised in Chicago.  It was good, but don't expect the beef to taste like Al's in Chicago.  The taste is just a little off, but not in a bad way, just not the same.  Could be the seasoning or where this franchisee gets the beef from.  The fries are great.  I'd go back but with lower expectations."}
{"text":"Found this place on Groupon.com The employees were all nice and friendly and chatted with me while they made our food. We got a 50's burger and a BBQ chicken sandwich with some blue cheese fries, DELISH! The fries especially were AWESOME with the nice hot sauce they put under the cheese. Would come back again :-) There will always be \"Chicago style\" snobs which is fine, they can go elsewhere and whine while I dine and enjoy myself. ;)"}
{"text":"I come here probably 1-2 times a week and I don't think I'll ever get tired of it. The staff is very friendly and if there's a line it moves fast. As a Chicago native I know what an original Als beef taste like and you can definitely get that here but you gotta coach the person taking your order. If you want it like \"home\" you must tell them to \"soak\" your sandwich .....thank me later ;)"}
{"text":"So many different opinions, you just have to try for yourself. Me... If I'm in the area, it's Al's. Every time.  The Italian Beef is very, very good. No Chicagoans, It's not Portillo's. It's not supposed to be. It's Al's! So to all of us who hail from the windy city, let's all hold hands and make peace with the fact that Al's isn't Portillo's. That's why the sign above the door say's \"Al's\". Now shut up about it!  I ate at Portillo's three or four times a week when I was back home, and I'm looking forward to them being here too. But I'm just as happy to have Al's. This place is great!  The Polish is very good. Hot Dogs are great; The Combo was sooo sloppy good I was in heaven. The Italian Beef was awesome! Love the dipped option, sweet & hot with provolone. Sooooo damn good I'm getting hungry just thinking about it now!  Fries are just like Nanna's Hot Dogs on Irving Park, what I grew up with. Sooooo good! And to J.P. from Chandler.... All of the hot dog places I grew up with in Chicago always did and still do wrap your fries and dog together in paper. It's authentic, so enjoy the experience.  Folks, it comes to this. Al's does it their own way, so quit comparing it to every other place. They don't need to be anyone else! This place is great, a Chicago Institution that has stood the test of time, and worth the price tag. Especially if you're a wayward Chicagoan longing for the flavor's and feel of the windy city.   Walk into Al's, and you're home. Even if just for a little while. Mangiare!"}
{"text":"Just as good as Chicago 's Al's Beef.  I get the beef w/ hot peppers double dipped, which means they soak the whole sandwich it in the juice. So good, I think I'll be going about once a week."}
{"text":"Chicago area born and bred... While Als is a Chicago place, their beef is just NOT indicative of  a good Chicago beef... It just doesn't make my eyes roll back and take my mouth home...   The \"gravy\" has something red in it...??? What???  No! It should be a nice, rich Au Jus with lots of Italian seasoning... What on earth do you put in it? Is that paprika? Nutmeg? Whatever it is... Get it out!!!!  The Giardinaria is also sub-par.  What makes Chicago gardinaria special is that the veggies and peppers stay crispy... Als is mushy.    The dogs are good. That's where any \"taste of Chicago\" ends here for me. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I was so very disappointed!!!  This is not even close to the Al's Beef on Taylor street.  The beef tastes old and the fries are limp and soggy.  The decor is nice but no counter space to put your tray while you get ketchup.  Not that I will ever be coming back!"}
{"text":"Dear Barry--  I have an observation, more than a review.  When we first moved here nearly five years ago.  The only place in town to get some Chicago food was Luke's.  Then Al's opened, but failed miserably and closed quickly.   You can still see my Two Star review.    This time last year (December 19, 2011), you took over and re-opened Al's, making it a genuine Chicago place.   King Scott and I came by after the re-opening and thought it was just as good as the one on 1079 W. Taylor Street,http://www.yelp.com/biz/als-no-1-italian-beef-chicago in Chicago's \"Little Italy\" near UIC, or the one on West Adams http://www.yelp.com/biz/als-italian-beef-chicago   What really knocked me out, were all the One Star, No profile Picture, One Review Yelp'ers who wanted to dump on your (Barry's) parade.  Who knew that Chicago dogs were so competitive here in Arizona?    I myself got a bunch of \"Neg-heads\" writing private messages, saying they couldn't eat here, never had a bite of the food, but thought the place was crap.  Or, the cheap-ohs who thought the prices were too high.  Geez!  I just came back from having lunch ($9.50) here and had a great time.  I ordered the Italian combo dipped, with gravy on the side.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!  I still go to Luke's from time to time, but Barry (Al) please know, you make a good Chicago Italian Beef!   Congrats to you and thank you for persevering!    --R/Georgie"}
{"text":"Special thanks to Nathaniel for making today Al's Beef experience enjoyable and the best of Las Vegas.  You guys do such a wonderful great job the beef is the best, you don't miss chicago with food like this here."}
{"text":"Al's Beef in Chicago was never one of my regular places that I ventured to to grab an Italian beef. There are so many other small \"ma & pa\" places that I pretty much passed Al's up. That being said, I at least got to try it in Scottsdale!  I ordered a sausage and beef combo with hot giardiniera and some fries. The fries were decent - crispy and salty. The giardiniera was great, and definitely looked and tasted like it was taken out of a big pot in back rather than a big jar from a wholesale store. The beef was also tasty and definitely seemed like it had been marinating in its juices for a couple hours. Everything was pretty good until the sausage. The sausage was an alright link, but it wasn't hot; it was cooling off. From \"order up\" to table to mouth is all it took, seemingly. I really like my hot sandwiches piping hot, especially when that sandwich is an Italian beef (hybrid). Shite happens unfortunately though, and at least the flavors were pretty good.   I'd give Al's another go. It passes, but didn't win me over."}
{"text":"Very good Italian beef dipped beefs are amazing!!! Hamburgers are good too and the tamales are just like Chicago tamales!!!"}
{"text":"\"Al's Beef\" in Las Vegas is a little piece of home in Las Vegas for me. You see I grew up in Chicago, an Chicago is famous for two things in food, Chicago Deep Dish Pizza and Al's Beef on Taylor Street. If you are here from Chicago and miss it just a little bit, head out to Al's Beef on Sahara. You won't be disappointed, from the picture of \"Da Coach\" Mike Ditka welcoming you in the lobby, to the great Italian Beef you remember from Home! Al's gets 5 stars in my book, try it I wouldn't lie about a Chicago institution!"}
{"text":"disappointed had the italian beefs.seemed to missing a certain spice that chicago beefs have.best italian beef we found at the omelet house on rampart.he flys in beef and buns from chicago."}
{"text":"Italian beef is apparently pretty popular in north Scottsdale - there are three Chicago-style beef places within 2 miles of my work - this one, Luke's, and Taste of Chicago, all three with good Italian beef and other Chicago classics.  Al's just opened recently, and I think I'd have to call it my favorite of the three.  The shaved beef is excellent, very flavorful and seasoned perfectly.  I usually add provolone cheese and grilled onions, which go perfectly with the sandwich.  I would definitely recommend getting your sandwich \"dipped\" (the entire sandwich, including bread, gets dipped in the meat juice), to infuse the bread with flavor, otherwise the bread does tend to be slightly dry and hard - not bad, but just not as good as when it's dipped.  The fries are very good - freshly cooked and well seasoned, with a home-cooked flavor that beats out the fries at most places.  I'm interested in trying some of the other menu items, like the hot dogs, chicken, and burgers, but with Italian beef this good, it's hard to pick something different."}
{"text":"Came here not because of advertising, not because of word of mouth, not because of a Yelp search, or even a drive by, I came here because of Andrew C's check in and the hilarity that followed because of his assessment of the sausage that was in his sandwich.  So me and Brian P had to investigate why they put whole sausages instead of sliced ones in their sandwiches. We found out that slicing it was really not necessary. Brian P ordered the combo which had beef and sausage while I ordered just the beef. Sorry, after all the talk about sausages, I wanted to stay away from it. Lol.  Ok, for you first time noobs, the way I see it, you only have one of three options. Forget about all the other things on the menu because if their namesake is not good enough for you then neither will any of those will either. Now, get the beef, sausage, or combo which has both. Then you pick one of three sizes. Little Al (4 inch), Regular Al (6 inch), and Big Al (8 inch). Now if you are not getting any sides, then go with the 8 inch. Order a small fries and the 6 inch you'll be very satisfied. Now if you order any of the specialty fries meaning several options with toppings, then you have better just get the 4 inch because those specialty fries are pretty much a meal in themselves.  What I got was the Regualr Al (6 inch) with provolone, peppers, and onions plus a small fries. Now the sandwich only comes with beef. Anything you add costs 50 cents extra. Now I have been to Windy City Beefs off of Eastern and I dont remember them charging extra for peppers and onions so I thought this was kind of weird. Total came out to a little over 10 bucks and thats without a fountain drink.  Next, you have to specify whether you want it dry, wet, or dipped. Dry is just that. No gravy or \"au jus\" which are the natural juices from the cooked meat. Wet, they actually dip the meat in au ju and throw it in the sandwich. For those that are really into it, get your sandwich dipped. Thats when they literally dip your whole sandwich in the sauce and the bread gets really soggy. It is recommended you eat it with a fork for trying to pick it up with your bare hands can get quite messy not to mention you looking silly trying to bite into a sandwich that is falling apart.  Tastewise, it is comparable to several other places I have eaten at. I have tried it all three ways and looks like wet is my preference for I think you get just the right amount of beef juice without going overboard with the bread getting soggy to the point that its just one big gooey mess. I like to handle my sandwiches with my own two hands thank you very much.  As for their location and service, they are kind of on the corner of Sahara and Rainbow right next to Buffet@Asia. Most of the parking is taken up by that buffet so you just might have to look for something further out sometimes. Service wise, I thought they were pretty friendly and handled my order in a timely manner.  Overall, this place is tied with several other places that serve the same thing. It tasted pretty much the same and nothing really stood out. I know Adam Richman says these guys have the best beef sandwiches but to the average hard working American, I beg to differ. Once I find a place that blows away my comparisons, I will make sure to give Adam my two cents and also to you hard working Americans as well.  Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #124 \"Sausage Party?

{"text":"If you like Italian sandwiches you must stop by Al's Italian. Great beef sandwiches and fries. The menu offers many different choices. The service was fast and friendly. Will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were alright but nothing too special about the place. Prices are good, service is friendly as well."}
{"text":"I went in the other day for a burger and was not impressed. While i'm still a fan I will stick with the Italian beefs. Five Guys makes a much better burger, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Very similar to the store in Chicago.  Tried dbl cheese burger two thumbs up.  It was well structured.Very good and staff very welcoming friendly."}
{"text":"Found this place thanks to yelp, Maxwell St polish sausage is very good and the hand cut fries do not dissapoint. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon which was about to expire so I went in and bought a few things. The Italian beef was decent but seasoned a bit differently than I'm used to but still very good. The giardinera was nice and spicy but not so hot to bring one to tears.  My wife really enjoyed their burger with bacon and Swiss. I tasted it and it was good. My favorite thing on the menu thus far is the polish sausage, and Italian beef/Italian sausage combo. It's a lot of food so I break it up into 2 meals. The servers were friendly enough and the menu is huge so when walking up to the counter best have an idea what to order otherwise you make the line longer for those behind you. But with so many choices on the menu it's hard to know which way to go. Fries are included along with dogs and sausages so no need to add them with those items. Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"We had lunch and ordered the beef combo.  The bread was very dry and fell apart.  The beef had no flavor at all. My guess is the problem lies with lack of any seasoning.  I requested \"a \"wet\" sandwich and it was wet all right!  More like double dipped.  The fries were good, but a little salty.  Windy City still reigns as the best Italian beef.  Being from Chicago we grew up on good beef.  This is not it."}
{"text":"Stopped by here randomly when looking for somewhere to eat for dinner one night. I'm not really into hotdogs so I ordered one of the beef and sausage \"dipped\" sandwiches w/ fries. It was about $10.95 for the combo. Unfortunately, although i did request the sandwich dipped, I did not care for the soggyness of it. The sandwich came very oily and the meat was also pretty bland. I ended up dipping it in ketchup to get more flavor out of it. Maybe Chicago sandwiches just ain't my thang.   I also have a pet peeve for restaurants where you can smell the odor of cleaning products or bathroom smell out in the restaurant. But that isn't my reason for the rating, just something I noticed."}
{"text":"Bottom line: the new owners bring you better beef than Al's in Chicago. Yes-they really do.  Italian food tastes better in Italy (usually). That meal on a dock in Sausalito is not the same even if you copy it exactly when you get home. Food is an experience that is altered by the location, mood, companions and results.  So, being at Al's in Scottsdale is not the same as being in Chicago...that's obvious, so get over the fact that you're stuck in North Scottsdale, and not in the Windy City. But the new owner's seem to have this place clicking. The sandwich is awesome, and they work the floor to check on your experience. They care. I read a bad review about a hambuger here...are ya nuts? Al's...ditch the burger...who cares? and customer...what the heck brought you here for a burger? Sheeesh. I digress...again.  I have always enjoyed a trip to Al's in Chicago. Portillo's, Johnny's, and don't even get me going on the Portillo's vs Al's debates, but even though Al's beef wasn't always the best quality, the combination of beef, grease, jardiniere, gravy (jus), spices, and peppers at Al's has always nailed it flavor-wise for my palate. When I worked in Phoenix, a trip to Luke's on Indian School every few months would deliver an OK time, but it didn't really satisfy my craving for great Italian beef. The first franchise for Al's at this location, brought those flavors I was craving, but messed up everything else about running a restaurant, and I still went back, and was sad to see them not make a go of it.  Unfortunately, that left a flavor void, and I kept waiting for new Management to get open...and just before they did, I went on a very serious training and diet regime. My latest race results and training schedule gave me a little room for coming off the regime a little, and I decided today was my perfect cheat day...I mean Al's day.  They really nailed it. My fries were wonderful (I was eating them while they were bringing me hot sauce)....crisp, slightly browned, gooey in the middle, loaded with flavor, without being over-salted.   The beef was absolutely great, better meat than original Al's in Chicago, as good as Portillo's in meat quality, but with all those insanely fantastic flavors I remember from my best sandwiches at Al's. Definitely one of my best sandwiches so far in 2012...and I highly suggest the \"Wet, with a side of gravy\" method.  Many may object, (oh, ye lazy masses) but, I think Al's tradition of fully-dipped sandwiches leaves you with a sodden mess, that takes the bread out of the sandwich equation. If you are indeed- lazy, well then the dipped style gives you more wet bread that has soaked up that insanely good flavor combination. So if you are lazy, and also-messy, get it dipped. But there is a better way- it just takes a little work and technique...so simple it's easily mastered by a hungry 7 year-old, but they can also fix a frozen iPhone, so....  The perfect compromise is to order the sandwich Wet, with a big side of gravy (no charge for that- thank god). You can pour large amounts of the jus into the end as you go (obviously held upright), pinching the sandwich down below your planned bite, so the jus doesn't just run through, but soaks the meat and that portion of the bread from the inside out. Lot's of the jus is what Al's beef needs to soak the meat and release that delicious flavor combination, absolutely soaking the bread too, but maintaining the sandwich integrity, while adding in a tiny little bread crunch on the outside.   (As a caution: you can order the beef \"Dry\". My advice if that would be your choice: don't go here. This is not a sandwich that is designed to be eaten dry- the beef will be flavorless and without charm. A Roast Beef from a good deli will be awesome if that is what you are in the mood for)  \"Wet, gravy on the side, sweet and hot peppers, cup of hot sauce.\". Spice the gravy up with hot sauce to your taste, pinch that sandwich, and pour as you go.  Freaking awesome sandwich, that blows away the local alternatives. And I'm perfectly happy with a spotless, new interior in North Scottsdale. I don't need Chicago memorabilia or grungy atmosphere to enhance my sandwich experience when the beef is this good. Bring a few good friends, order up a few beef, try a combo with sausages, share and compare, and start your own great dining tradition. Very cool to think that I won't be jamming a daily Italian beef into every Chicago trip just because I couldn't get them anywhere else.   Gotta step up the training another notch so this can be a weekly lunch choice, because I am stuffed right now, and I still want more of that flavor!!"}
{"text":"After a friend raved about the food, we decided to try Al's.  My husband ordered the beef sandwich, which he said was okay.  I ordered a hot dog, which was disappointing.  It was small and not satisfying (and I am usually a light eater).  The atmosphere is good though (clean and no customer service complaints).  We were really hoping to be blown away by the food and were disappointed that is was just okay.  Our comparison is Dickie's Dogs at McDowell Mountain Ranch.  Dickie's had amazing food but unfortunately is now closed :("}
{"text":"I kind of wondered how long it would take for Al's Beef to close up shop after Portillo's arrived in town. Al's closed down a week or so ago. Their beef sandwiches as of the last few months were not as tasty as I remembered when the new ownership took over. I guess the Al's Beef experiment is over in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great all beef dogs and beef sandwiches, hospitable kids running the place but a bit of fraternity feel! The Muzak music was up so loud the speakers were distorting :-)! Get it to go!"}

{"text":"Wow!  I cannot remember the last time I took one bite of a sandwich and put it down and uttered gross. One of the worst sandwiches I've ever been served. Couldn't figure out if the spicy pepper mix was bad or if it was the beef. Absolutely awful."}
{"text":"Friends told me to check out this place and so a few of my friends decided to come eat here!!! Place is so clean and the food is so good!!! Karla took such good care of us!!! I can't wait to tell all of my friends about this place!!!"}
{"text":"Won't go back. First week = awesome. Now = Worst service ever! The beefs aren't any good either! Guys!!!! What happened??? This is NOT the Chicago way!!!!!"}
{"text":"Raised in Chicago area with Italian friends that covered the bed with ravioli for one of the six courses. Real Italians did this! :- ) That said, this was one of the WORST beef sandwiches I ever had. Asked double dipped - came dry. Beef was cold! Had to seek out the Giardinera. Blue cheese fries were cold. Now for the bad part! :- ) The juice had a peppery taste. I thought maybe Al's in Chicago had a different taste. Girl next to us had been to Al's in Chicago before. She said this was not his. None of the 8 people we talked to would come back. Windy City and Aurelio's Pizza are the best in town. I gave it one star as a stretch."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Chicago  and never go back without visiting Portillos at least once.  I am 5'3\" 115 lbs. and my order is a beef sandwich, extra gravy, sweet and hot peppers, an oder of onion rings, a \"Chicago\" style hot dog, a  tamale and chopped salad.  Oh, and a diet Coke because I'm watching my weight :-)  My brother told me about Al's and thought the beef sandwiches were comparable to Portillos.  Since I didn't have my entire Chicago family with me to help eat my meal, I stuck with the beef sandwich (with hot and sweet peppers and dipped), the tamale and had to go with their french fries because they didn't have onion rings.   The beef sandwich was okay, but wasn't as good as Portillos.  I guess my main complaint would be the giardineria.  While they say the giardineria is freshly made, I've had better from a jar.  Although it was spicy, the taste was a bit off.  The fries.  According to the menu, they are freshly cut and made each day.  They need to send somebody over to In-N-Out Burger to see how its properly done.  They were not that good.   The tamale.  People born and raised in AZ may not appreciate these types of tamales, but they are what I grew up on.  Al's tamale came in a plastic wrapper (are these picked up from Costco in boxes of 24?) and are nuked.  I guess in the day they were steamed, but with the introduction of the microwave, that's how they are cooked today.  Unfortunately, mine may have been in the microwave a couple seconds too long.  Still edible, but pretty dry.  And it does lose something when it comes in that plastic wrap.  I didn't have a chance to check out their hot dogs or chopped salad.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go back there again (which I did today), but if I were in the area, I would go back and try the dog and chopped salad.  Luke's is being opened down the street from my home, so I'll have to do a comparison.  In the years I have been in Arizona I have yet to be impressed by any establishment claiming that something is \"Chicago\" style.  I'm not quite sure why it's so difficult.  Portillos does have two stores in the Los Angeles suburbs - when I have a hankering, I am just going to have to hop in the car and take a road trip  for lunch!"}
{"text":"There is not much services needed, it is just a walk up counter. I did order sweet peppers, which I had to go up and ask for again when my order came because they were not on my sandwich. Also I ordered the dipping sauce on the side, which was forgotten too so I had to ask for that again as well! I got the Italian beef and sausage combo... I could have done without the sausage but the Italian beef and the sauce was delicious!"}
{"text":"I may not be from Chicago but I love a good beef sandwich and I might have to chalk this visit up to Al's having growing pains.   For starters, they have a fairly large menu that's not only limited to beef sandwiches. There's pretty much something for everyone including burgers, dogs, wraps, salads and chicken sandwiches. They also have a few small items like tamales, chili and a handful of fry variations.   I decided on a Big Al, dipped with hot peppers and provolone. Even though we ate there, they wrapped my sandwiche and wrapped it good. Kudos for not having to pull a soggy cluster of wrappers from a soggy bag. The beef was good, very tender and good flavor on it's own. The \"gravy\" as they call it was also good but it was a lot greasier than I expected. My biggest gripe about the sandwich was that it was barely hot, not spicy hot but temperature. The entire sandwich was just warm and the slices of provolone inside weren't melted at all. Maybe it was my fault for not leaving it in the wrapper long enough? I don't know, but I like my cheese melted and gooey. We also ordered some homemade fries which were really good. I didn't see them do it but they definitely seem to be fresh cut.  While the food was decent, I feel it's extremely overpriced for what you get. The sandwich alone was $7.90 but then they charge $0.45 for each item you pick like cheese or peppers. My sandwich ended up coming out to just under $9. This isn't a huge sandwich either so I added fries and with my drink, my bill came out to just under $15. That's high for what looks and feels like a fast food joint.  Another big surprise for me was service. I know they are new but our cashier didn't even know where things were on the menu. Then when I asked for my receipt, they wouldn't give it to me and had to ask if I was allowed to keep it...super weird. There were a lot of employees standing around here chatting too. Why the drink station was dirty and the utensil tray was empty is beyond me. Like I said, maybe growing pains but I'll give it a while before I come back."}
{"text":"While the staff is very friendly and their beef is delicious (I'm from Chicago), this is only the 2nd time I've been here, and both times called them out on FALSE ADVERTISING.  1.  They have a punch card that says buy 9 and get your tenth one free.  That is not the case.  You only get one punch PER ORDER PER VISIT, irregardless of how many beefs you order.  2.  I went to order two beefs from the guy standing at the door filling out order cards and he said it's only 1 per person.  I said, 'Your add didn't say that.  I can show it to you if you want.'  I took out my iPhone and started to open up Facebook.  'Oh, did you see the one on Facebook?'  'Yeah, I left that off.  I just wanted to get people to come in.'  'That's false advertising.'  'Ok, you're right.  I'll let you get two.'  Not sure I'll be back.  It's just on principle, and in my opinion, lying to the customers, whom they rely on to stay in business.  If it wasn't for those two things, and being a little pricey, I would have given them a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"Decent Chicago Italian beef sandwich.   I got the \"Big Al\" with a drink and it cost me almost 12 bucks.   To me, not worth it especially when Buffet Asia is right next door."}
{"text":"Very expensive,very stingy with the meat, but super bright & clean restaurant.nicest most polite & beautiful Black employees.."}
{"text":"There's just something in a restaurant's name that will lure me for a visit. Like Al's Beef. Those words together conjure up fantastical images of hunky blue collared workers. You know the ones; they work hard and play harder, each one starving, looking to get his fill of Al's thick juicy Italian Beef sandwiches.  In 1938, Al's Beef opened as a food stand in Chicago's Little Italy. The idea for the Italian Beef sandwich came during the Depression when meat was scarce. So, in order to help stretch the meat to feed more people, the roasted beef was shaved extremely thin, then made into sandwiches.  Over the years, Al's flourished, earning accolades such as Best Sandwich in America from Esquire, Playboy and others. They were even featured earlier this year on one of my favorite TV shows, Man vs. Food, in an episode titled \"Da Italian Stance.\"  In Chicago, there's an art to eating an Al's Italian Beef sandwich. In the \"Italian Stance,\" the diner's knees are slightly bent, posterior slightly up and out and elbows on the counter. This technique helps to avoid getting Al's gravy on your shoes. It's not the traditional gravy you might think of putting on mashed potatoes, but more like the pan drippings from the roasted beef they dunk the entire sandwich in, bread and all.  Unfortunately, all of this amazing history and media attention doesn't seem to matter to the new franchised location in North Scottsdale. The concept here is fast casual, order from the counter, then getting your number called a few minutes later to pick up your food.  The interior was spotlessly clean, the staff relatively friendly and the concept easy, what's not to like? Unfortunately, the food.  I started with the Big Al ($7.45), the 8-inch version of their Italian Beef sandwiches. I want to eat it like Chicagoans do, so I ordered the sandwich dipped, then covered with hot giardiniera, a relish of pickled peppers and vegetables. Taking my position, with my butt in the air and my elbows on the counter top, I took the first bite. First I was amazed just how juicy the sandwich was. Then another surprise hit me -- the meat was almost flavorless.  I was so disappointed that after a few bites I decided to try a Chicago Dog ($3.10). But the hot dog was so small and shriveled I wasn't sure you could call it a hot dog; more like a hot mess.  There were a few highlights, including the delicious Bleu Cheese Fries ($4.50), perfectly cooked French fries covered with bleu cheese crumbles and dressing. Another treat was the Tamale Boat ($5.80), two Chicago-style tamales covered with chili, cheddar cheese and onions.  When one of the employees decided that it was time for Headbangers Ball, playing thrash metal over the restaurant's loudspeakers, I took it as my cue to leave.  Maybe this place should be renamed Al's French Fried Tamale Mosh Pit? Rock on man, rock on."}
{"text":"The 4 stars is all towards the food. The service in this place is very good but they cant ever seem to get orders right. Not sure if its volume or just not paying attention to detail. The Italian beef is great and the Chicago dog is amazing. Ive had the beef 4 times and 3/4 times the order either didn't have cheese when I ordered it or didn't have sweet peppers. Seems like the morning people do it better than the night people. Maybe just my experience. still I will be back over and over again plus its right across the street. finally some competition for hot dog heaven."}
{"text":"Well, it's been almost a year since I first went to Al's.  I was really wanting an Italian Beef, so I decided to try it again, hoping they'd improved.   There must be something special in Chicago that makes the gravy good, because it just doesn't translate to Las Vegas.  It does not taste anything like the Italian Beef sandwiches I've had in Chicago.  Last time I got the sandwich \"dipped.\"  This time, I just got it \"wet\".  The gravy just doesn't taste right.  And the sweet peppers are not sweet.  They have no flavor whatsoever.  The bread was good.  And I had the cheddar cheese fries.  They were decent.  However, their Gargonzola/Blue Cheese Fries are better.   I do like their fries.  And I will say the reason they get two stars is that the staff is fast and friendly and the place is immaculate.  They do an incredible job cleaning the place.  However, there were only three other customers with me in the place at 5:30pm.  I worry about the longevity of this place.  They definitely need to contact the mothership in Chicago to learn what they are doing wrong to the gravy.  Don't see me going back here again."}
{"text":"Just got home from Al's and all I can say is awesome? My wife and myself each had a Big Al dipped with provolone and shared a large fry. We could have shared one Big Al as it was huge and full of meat. The fries are very good and hand cut. I am glad I live in Henderson because I would be eating at Al's all of the time. We took home a Big Al dry for my son and it was still juicy and not dry. This place is great and worth the drive. Only thing I didn't like is that they charge for a cup of gravy for those of us who like to dip and the cup is very small not dippable."}
{"text":"Went on the first day and it was super busy. Staff is nice and friendly Food is good....beef sandwich and hot dogs are great....fried were home made fresh cut...cheese fries could use more cheese. Good fast food spot for lunch!"}
{"text":"In the world of chicago dogs, these were deelish!! Loaded fries were yummy too. They have a special, 2 dogs plus fries and a drink for under $10! Added the extras to make them loaded and its more than enough for two people! Awesome bang for your buck. Very friendly staff. Asked for a sample of the beef for maybe next time, and it was pretty good too. Only complaint is the cooking fan was really loud and combine that with the music playing it was a bit too loud."}
{"text":"Have been enjoying the food here for years now only to find that it just closed up last week.  Sure hope it opens up again and soon because the good there was excellent!"}
{"text":"The Italian beef sandwiches were just like the ones i got back in Chicago!  So good!  You've got to get it wet with peppers and cheese!  Its just what we needed after a long night of drinking perfect hang over food!"}
{"text":"The food was great, the service however, terrible. The girl that took my order was great. But as you move down the line to pick up your order, moral gets lower and lower. The girl that took my order asked me if it was my first time visiting them( which it was) and then threw some suggestions my way. I went with the \"big al\" and got it what they call \"wet\" with sweet peppers. The sandwich with a drink came up to almost $12. Not a big deal, but for that price, how about a side of fries? As I walk down the counter to the order pick-up, I noticed smiles turned to frowns and everyone had their heads down. This girl that handed me my order didn't make eye contact, just kinda slid my tray at me and said \"enjoy\".   Now onto the dining area. You can tell the place still needs some work, but not a big deal. I personally would have made sure my store was 100% before opening, but that's just me.   So to wrap this up: Food was expensive for what you actually get, but it was delicious  Appearance is a little rough. But nothing a little tlc can't fix.   Service goes for good to terrible. Which for me is a big turn off considering Las Vegas is a service based town."}
{"text":"As other reviewers have mentioned, the beef dip sandwich is good and it's great quality. There is some seasoning missing though- not sure what it is."}
{"text":"Not as good as the one I used to go to on Taylor Street in Chicago. Maybe they need to import Chicago water.   The service is painfully slow. The guy ordering in front of me only ordered a couple of simple items with no customization, but the cashier spent quite a while, maybe 5 minutes to complete the order."}
{"text":"I'm so sorry I didn't take a picture of my \"Big\" Beef.  It was pathetic.  I asked for it WET, and having been born and raised in Chicago, I knew what I was talking about.  The sandwich was dry and the amount of Italian beef on this sandwich was minuscule.  I am giving an overall rating of 3 stars because the Chicago Hot Dog was about a 4 star.  Everything about it was great except for the dry stale hot dog bun.  Chicago buns are steamed and NEVER dry and crumbly like the ends of THIS hot dog bun.  Back to the BEEF!  By the way, the only reason I know how good the hot dog was is because I was still hungry after eating/finishing the \"Big\" Beef.  The amount of Italian beef on this sandwich would be an embarrassment to the Chicago location on Adams street.  The french fries were very good, 4 stars for the fries.  Did I mention how disappointed we were in the beef sandwich?  You would think that if the name of the restaurant included No. 1 Beef, they would pay a bit more attention to how the sandwich was put together.  The flavor was the only saving grace for this sandwich.  I live on the east side of town, so it will be quite awhile before I travel back to the west side to see if this AL's listens to the reviews of their customers and pays more attention to the NAME of the restaurant.  AL's No. 1 Beef!!!!  I submitted \"comments\" on the website and rec'd a reply today from someone who would forward my comments to the owner, let's see where this gets us!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend was craving for some dip sandwiches and we kind of stumbled along this place. I give them the two stars because of the amazing service and the sheer fact that my boyfriend liked it. I got the beef dipped with hot peppers and a small loaded fries. I expected the sandwich to be wet and messy, so I prepared myself with lots of napkins, a fork and knife. I looked at it, and it looked like a slop of goodness. When I took the first bite, I wasn't impressed. It lacked flavor with an overwhelming amount of grease. My experience with au jus sauce is suppose to be flavorful, since it is coming from the drippings of the meat and a taste of herbs. If the meat is not flavorful, the au jus will not be either. So, there you go, the meat was bland on top of the au jus sauce. The only flavorful thing was the hot peppers. I couldn't finish the sandwich and ended up throwing the other half away.   The loaded potatoes were not that great. The bacon on top was overly salty and the cheese seemed like it was from the frito can. The bacon seemed like the artifical bacon in the bag that has been preserved for years (the salad toppings one). I felt gross after eating the food and I felt like grease was coming out of my pores. I just felt like they hyped it up with the food network, man vs food etc, but never lived up to the hype. They were the hype men and never got the party started. On the other hand, my boyfriend liked it and he said it tastes good. So, to each their own."}
{"text":"This is the place to go in Scottsdale for an Italian beef.  When I visit Chicago I usually go to Al's or Portillo's for Italian beef and having Al's here saves me the trip to the Windy City.  The decor here is nice with several motorcycles displayed throughout the restaurant for some reason.  It's neat and clean and plenty of helpful employees provide relatively quick service.  I ordered the regular Al's beef with sweet peppers.  I usually don't order my sandwiches \"wet\" because they come with plenty of juice already.  Good flavor and just the right size.  The fries were thick but a little greasy for my taste.  All in all, a good lunch and a place to keep in mind when I'm feeling like a taste of Chicago."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a really good Italian beef sandwich, you will find it here. Hubby and I stopped here for dinner and left full and satisfied. The inside is clean and there are plenty of tables. The employees were friendly and went over some of the menu items with us. They have Italian sausage, wraps, char-grilled burgers, hot dogs, salads, chili, tamales and fries, but my first time I had to try what they are famous for.  So, I ordered an \"Italian Beef Sandwich\" (regular Al) priced at $6.35 and added provolone and hot peppers for 50 cents each topping as well asked for the sandwich to be dipped. The bread really held up everything in it very well. Napkins are required when eating this sandwich dipped! The beef was tender and had good flavor and the peppers added a nice flavor to the sandwich. I also ordered a small \"Cheddar Cheese Fries\" priced at $3.85 and just thought they were average. Next time I am going to try them with different toppings. I liked that my food was made fresh in front of me. There isn't a drive-thru here, but if you are on a time crunch you can phone in your order for pick-up."}
{"text":"No complaints. Food is good. Menu is simple. I've been a few times. It's better than going to McDonald's. If you want good food if it a try."}
{"text":"I remember being blown away by the Al's Beef I had in Chicago.  This not so much.   Service was quick and friendly and I thought there was a fair amount of meat on the sandwich but there was nothing special about it.  I ordered it with everything and they skimped on the cheese.  I don't see myself going back any time soon."}
{"text":"O. M. F'ing. Gee!   It was so good, and delivery was so fast...like faster than freaky fast...it was like Roadrunner fast...or Speedy Gonzales 'ANDALE ANDALE ARRIBA ARRIBA YEE HAW YEE HAW' rapido, or like 'Chip, I'm gonna come at you like a spider monkey!' fast...and just as quickly, it was gone.  To be honest, I don't even think the italian beef sandwich, drenched and then smothered in sweet and hot peppers with provolone cheese, even knew what hit it. One moment, it's all safe, warm & cozy in its pot, skillet, oven...wherever italian beef comes from, then BAM! it's whisked off on a whirlwind adventure, delivered and not even 10 minutes later swimming in tummy acid. Happy tummy acid.   To be frank (because I guess I already used 'To Be Honest'), I have enjoyed other tamales w/ chili and cheese a *skosh* better (not bad, but not the best ever), but the italian beef sandwich today has me hooked (plus they have pink lemonade AND deliver, and that ALWAYS makes working Tygers happy).   Lots of delicious sounding stuff on the menu, I'm looking forward to trying the chicago dog and the buffalo bleu fries.   One note to the delivery driver/to-go order specialists/management:   When delivering a giant mess of a sandwich, make sure to also include napkins, fork and knife. Maybe even some of those moist towelettes they give to bbq revelers. While Clinton and Lewinski may think it's cute to have a little mess on a dress, the people I work with do not appreciate it. *  *Just kidding, no dresses were harmed during the scarfing down of this meal.*"}
{"text":"Italian beef had no taste at all,large sandwich was over priced...Portillo's in Buena Park by knotts berry farm was much more authentic, had a larger cheaper sandwich....both are tourists trap's"}
{"text":"I used to fly all the way to Chicago for these beefs....NO MORE!!! they're in Las Vegas now! They are oMG good!"}
{"text":"Love it! Love it! Love it!  It reminds me of home (Chicago) and I am soooooo happy to have one here in Phoenix.   I recommend  getting an Italian beef dipped with hot and sweet peppers. And, NO, the hot peppers really aren't all that hot. The peppers, both hot and sweet, are an essential part of the sandwich. They add so much delectable flavor to an already delicious sandwich.   Don't forget the dip. Yes, it's messy. But when it tastes this good...who really cares?"}
{"text":"I grew up in Chicago, and the last meal that I ate there before leaving Chicago for basic training in the 1970's was at Max's on Western Avenue.  I ordered Max's Italian Combo dipped with home made Giardinara. In the 70's there weren't McDonalds on every corner, and normal fast food was a loaded dog with sports peppers at Flukey's or Wolfies.  Max's was considered on par with Al's, but closer to where I lived.  Going out for an Italian Beef was one step above fast food.  Although I've passed Al's on Sahara several times, I didn't realize that it was a \"Beef Joint\" until today.  The building looks more like a \"Tommy Rockers\" than a beef shack.  I ordered a large Beef, dipped, with giardinara.   After taking one bite, it took me back to my early days in Chicago.    Al uses a bread that takes a dip well, and although it's not quite the same as what I remembered, it actually is better suited to the beef than Max's.  The beef was tender and fell apart in your mouth, unlike the slightly hardier meat that Max used.  The giardinara that Al uses is more like a relish than the traditional marinated larger pieces, but the giardinara relish held better to the sandwich and didn't lack in flavor.  The star of the beef was the juice.  It was tasty and well dipped. (The price of the large beef with peppers was $9.00.  Not inexpensive but not exorbitant.)   I proudly wore the beef's drippings on my t-shirt as I savored the meal.  I noticed that Al's also offers \"Chicago style hotdogs\" on its menu.  Although the Chicago store didn't serve dogs, I'll have to try one next time I'm in the area.  Let's face it, a beef sandwich is not gourmet food (hence the 4 stars), but it is a good quality beef.  If you enjoy a good beef sandwich give Al's a try, but please get it dipped, eating it dry is simply unpatriotic."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, after the first bite of the beef sandwich I wish I had gone to Windy City Beefs on Buffalo and Lake Mead. Al's is definitely not the best beef in town. Not even close. It was just OK. The beef was tough and if they call the pepper mixture giardiniera they have no clue what giardiniera really is. Wow. Who makes Italian beef sandwiches and doesn't understand giardiniera??  Anyway. If you are starving you could eat here but I won't waste my money here again."}
{"text":"Thanks to Groupon, we've dined at this place several times.  Each time, I've had the Beef Sandwich....here's how I order it:  - Dry w/Gravy on the side (Choices are Dry, Dipped, Wet)  - Hot Giardiniera Peppers (Choices are Hot or Sweet Peppers) - Provolone Cheese (Choices are Provolone, Cheddar, Cheese Whiz) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/als-beef-scottsdale?select=jzfT8qobYwYp5wxuFxOF4g#jzfT8qobYwYp5wxuFxOF4g  Let me tell you that the Beef is legit here!  This is an authentic Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich!  The Beef is moist, full of flavor, and the Bread holds it all together perfectly.  The Giardiniera is hot and spicy and makes the Sandwich even better.  I like to get the Gravy on the side so I can add more flavor as needed while I'm devouring the Sandwich.  The French Fries here are awesome too.  They remind me of the Fries at 5 Guys except they don't have the spice options that they offer there.  Doesn't matter, the Fries here are excellent....and addicting.    The rest of the family loves this place too.  We're very happy to have it so close to our neighborhood.  Return Factor - 97%"}
{"text":"I'm not sure where I went wrong here. Maybe ordering incorrectly or not tying the sausage. They didn't even have enough beef for the three sandwiches I ordered; we had to wait. Overall, the food was just not that good. Service was \"meh\". It was a pickup and we took it to work.   The beef was just bland - entirely unseasoned and so insanely dry despite the sauce. Asked for the \"gravy\" on the side, ended up with a sopping bun, leaking bag, and an extra charge for a side gravy instead. The other bun was hard and soaked in grease (not gravy - actual grease). The peppers were very tasty, but they tore up my co-workers stomach. She's not really a lightweight with her spicy foods, and even then she only asked for sweet peppers, not hot. I came out unscathed, luckily.   I'm not sure how this is considered Chicago beef. It's not at all juicy, flavorful, or spicy. It's just bland, messy, soggy, and rather unappealing. Perhaps I'm just spoiled after our little discovery during San Gennaro? A little booth at the fair called \"Gina's Italian Beef\". Amazing. I only wish she had an actual location, not just a seasonal booth."}
{"text":"We visited Al's last summer, excited that they opened a place nearby. I have had Italian Beef in Chicago at several places and locally, too. I'm not a connoisseur, per se, but I am a foodie and I've tasted enough Italian Beef to know what's fresh and what isn't.   The beef sandwich at this location was just really not that tasty and the fries were very limp and greasy! I was so disappointed. Maybe I will try it again, but with Joey's of Chicago near my home, I'll likely just stick with their more reliably fresh food."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times . Typical fast food nothing to brag about. If I'm starving and in the area I would pop in. Sure beats McDonald and BK."}
{"text":"Delicious! They do it just like it's done in Chicago....the Italian beef sandwich is really good- the beef is shaved and seasoned perfectly.  The Original Polish is served up with all the fixings on a steamed poppy seed bun. Perfection! I can't wait to bring my mom here."}
{"text":"Packed full of people and had to walk a bit for a parking space. Friendly and fast service. Had the regular Al's wet style. Not a big fan of soggy bread, so I didn't like that! Fries was the best part. Next time I am getting a burger!"}
{"text":"Heard a lot about Al's. ... Pretty Dam good sandwich. ..regular beef..wet..With sweet peppers. .. Look forward to trying other items"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the Italian beef and of course everyone is going to have their favorite places and tastes. But this seemed like a place to satisfy a lot of different tastes. There are several sizes, extra meat is available and if you are getting it to go, I'd say go for it! Only order it regular if you are a fan of super dry sandwiches. I'd say go for wet if you are like lightly moist but if you are a big au ju fan like I am, definitely hook it up with the dipped!! They have american, cheddar and provolone cheese (pretty sad they didn't have the mozzarella). They giardiniera was pretty good as were the sweet peppers. It wasn't too greasy or hard to eat while driving. They did have a variety of other things to eat so definitely check those out if you aren't up for a beef...but thats what they are known for!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a Big Al combo with sweet peppers and provolone and made it a combo with fries and drink.  $14.  The place was clean, the service was prompt, the food?  Mediocre.  The sandwich, which was expected to be the star was simply lackluster but the fries were tasty.    I would probably not come again as I feel for the price I could do much better at other nearby places"}
{"text":"The worst beef ever! This is the Mcbeef of Italian beef sandwiches I now need jack on the box to get the taste out of my mouth I'm joking about jack on the box but it's a terrible sandwich"}
{"text":"I've heard co-workers rave about this place all week, so I knew I had to get myself here today on my lunch break.  Maybe I've seen the Travel Channel feature of this chain. Maybe not. But for sure I've seen the Italian beef sandwich on a couple food shows. And now that these guys are popping up on the West Coast (yeah, I know Vegas isn't on the coast, bear with me), you don't even have to go all the way to Chicago to try it.  Business was brisk at peak lunch hour, but it wasn't overwhelmingly crowded even though they'd just opened a few days ago. I went for the Big Al, a 8 inch hunk of meat that all the ladies (and guys) are sure to love. The beef was awesome! It was ridiculously tender but still had lovely flavor and meaty texture. The sweet peppers were a nice complement and the bread definitely soaked up some of the au jus from the beef.  Yeah, the sandwich is a little on the pricey side at $7.90 (and the Regular Al is $6.35). But I was browsing through some of the other locations' menus on their web site, including Chicago franchises, and I saw that they were not all that much cheaper than this place.  I also had a small order of Homemade Fries (read: plain) for $2.55. I haven't bothered to look up who voted it top 10 in the U.S., but I could buy that argument since they had a balanced saltiness as well as both a soft inside and some crunch on the outside. The fries do complement the beef, so check them out at least once if you're not starch-averse or anti-spending.  I'm excited to go back and try a full helping of hot peppers (probably medium-ish even for my sensitive taste buds), as well as get some of the extra au jus that would probably take the sandwich to the next level. That's right, I didn't even ask to get a dipped sandwich or to get extra au jus on the side. The sandwich was still that good.  UPDATE: Went back a day latter, got a dipped Big Al with hot and sweet peppers and provolone. Even better. Can I give 6 stars, please?"}
{"text":"First time to Al's. Very good food and great prices. I had the beef and Italian sausage with hot and sweet peppers and blue cheese fries. Yummmmm"}
{"text":"Chicago's #1 Italian Beef since 1938 (in the old Prickly Pear).  It was actually quite yummy!  Just make sure you order your sandwich wet or dipped, do NOT go plain!  And, don't forget the sweet peppers (loved 'em) or the hot giardiniera.  Also, don't waste your time on Little Al!   The sandwich was really good, it wasn't too heavy or greasy.  Though, the fries were soggy, not a fan, maybe better next time?    Looking forward to going back and trying everything else!"}
{"text":"I went in last night, about 8PM and I was the only customer in there.  It was so hot, 99 degrees, and the girl who took my order told me it was that hot inside all day.  When I paid for my order there was a sign posted stating that this business will close forever at the end of July.  With 3 employees working that I saw, it took about 15 minutes to get my 1 pound of beef, bread and peppers.  Beef alone was very bland.  Lacked seasoning.  Gravy was so full of fat, that when I went to make a sandwich for lunch today, the quart of gravy was more than 1/2 fat, which I tossed.   With that said, I warmed the beef in the gravy which I removed the fat from.  I put some provolone on the bread, then a healthy serving of beef and topped it with the jardinaire.  It was very good and spicy.  Based on my experience, I would try it again.  Sad, because I have seen Al's so many times on TV but apparently Las Vegas has not been kind to this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome!  This is what I would expect out of Chi Beef. It was lean and had lots of flavor.  Will be going back and maybe tonight!"}
{"text":"Al's Beef lived up to its billing.  I've been a Luke's fan while living here - it's the closest beef sandwich experience I've had to get close to my Chicago growin' up days. But Al's was super perfect today - my first visit and everything was right.  I only had a regular beef and small fries, but the beef was tasty and juicy. It also had a bit of a spice thing happening that I don;t remember tasting in beef sandwiches before.  The fries were awesome. Literally awesome. Next time a medium Fries.  Hungry? Hit Al's next time up near 101 and Raintree."}
{"text":"I went to Al's today. The place is clean and the seating is good. The soda fountain is in a weird spot though. I ordered the Nacho fries and a Chicago dog with fries.   Chicago dog. I liked how it was made. There wasn't so much stuff in it that it all fell out every time you take a bite. I hate that when dogs are served that way. Also, I liked that the fries were stuffed in the dog bun along with some onions sport peppers and mustard. I didn't like they dog itself so much, It tasted alright but had a chewiness to it. I might have to try a couple more just to make sure. I give it a 4.   The Nacho fries. A lot of places make custom fries like this but I never had fries that had such a good taste to them. I don't know if my taste buds were playing tricks on me, but I could of sworn near the end of my nacho fries I tasted a sweet Bavarian cream donut taste. Kinda weird huh. I don't know how it got there but I want it again and again.  I give it a 5.   Tomorrow I'm going back to try the beef and maybe the Buffalo bleu fries. If the Beef turns out right I'll have to up the stars.  Ok I've been back like 30 times and have had 30 beefs. I thinks that about sums it up. I even like the smell it puts in my mustache. Sometimes I'll leave it in so a few hours later I can remember just how good lunch was today."}
{"text":"We order here all the time at work. Sometimes it takes us a little longer to get there and the little old lady always makes the order over because the food has gotten cold and always has a smile on her face! I go just because of her!"}
{"text":"I kept hearing about how great Al's beef was so I knew I had to try it for myself. I looked over the menu and ordered the regular Al (6\") and an order of the buffalo blue fries (Real potatoes drizzled with chunky blue cheese and tangy hot sauce. I would say the Italian beef had a unique taste not sure if that was a good thing. The fries on the other hand kicked ass I would order them again for sure."}
{"text":"Went to this location on a Friday evening. Shanice was so helpful and hooked it up! I had the combo, Italian beef and sausage. Man, it was so good! Big and beefy, very satisfying. I will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Al's now has a $20 for $10 coupon on local dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).  A good deal that makes it worth checking out."}
{"text":"Placed my order early & still had to wait Asked for a double dip on my beef & didn't get 1 - asked again while I was there but they don't know what they're doing so I get home & my whole beef was dry as a bone. Screwed my entire order up - asked for balsamic dressing got blue cheese Asked for NO Parm cheese but still on there $30 for food I wouldn't feed to my dog?! Shame on you Al's!"}
{"text":"I should have known better that since the Cubs have spring training in Arizona, there must be a Chicago eatery around.  And there is one- one that I actually saw on tv once!  Thankfully it was Al's beef.  Go up, order, and they call your order when it's ready.  I got a Big Al, w/cheese and hot peppers- dipped.  Also got a side of chili-chese fries.  The place was big and clean, and of course, had the classic \"Welcome to Chicago\" slogan on the front door.  I couldn't imagine it any other way.  The sandwich was literally the best I have had.  The bread was soaked but still held up as I chomped it.  The peppers were finely chopped and gave it a great flavor that I cannot compare it too.  The only thing that prevented me from giving this place 5 stars was the huge Pepsi machine they had...  I think too for the price, you get a great deal.  The place isn't limited to beef, so keep that in mind if you are looking for something else to chomp on!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on opening day because of the freebies on behalf of my father. We have always gone to Luke's (yes, the 16th Street location too) and needless to say, I was disappointed. Had I not been to Luke's before, I'm sure my experience would have been better. Too commercialized, mid range tasting food. I won't be back on my own that's for sure."}
{"text":"I went 5:30 PM on Wednesday July 30, 2014. I had the number 1 Al's Beef with fries and a drink. I have heard mixed reviews and was glad to find out for myself. I really am not a huge beef eater these days but wanted to try their specialty. I was sold I thought the portions was really good for the price, everything was warm and tasty and you can refill your drink as much as you like. My # 1 was right at $10 with tax. My friend had a salad and gave it rave reviews it was both good and filling. In fact they took a good portion home. Its a casual place with a friendly staff and the lady at the register is so motherly with her smile how can I not come back? They have quite a few things I want to try! The fries were excellent and somebody who did not order their own kept reaching for mine and there were plenty.. So stop by and say hello to Mom.."}
{"text":"Oh man these guys are the real deal.  I had a Big Al combo beef n sausage w/ hot peppers.  Heaven in every bite!  One of my new favorite places in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Big Al Wet with Hot Peppers and Provolone Cheese.Cost was about $11.75 with a drink. The sandwich was made promptly, no problems ordering The sandwich was barely warm, the cheese wasn't melted,the hot peppers weren't even close to being hot. The meat was tender and lean, but the Gravy and meat had little flavor. It might as well been made in warm water. There has got to be a better place for a  Italian beef sandwich than this place. I was very disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is great. The staff is great. A ton of stuff to choose from. Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I heard there was an Al's Italian Beef place that opened in Vegas, so I had to try it. I have not been to Chicago for a while, so I was looking forward to getting a real Italian Beef from Al's.  I ordered the Italian Beef sandwich with sweet peppers, provolone cheese, and submerged in the beef gravy. It was just as I expected, very tasty. I did notice one thing different about the Vegas Al's. They barley put any beef on the sandwich. It was all bread, unlike the Chicago Al's. They need to make it just as they do in Chicago.  The lady that had taken my order was very pleasant, as was the rest of the staff. The store looked to be very clean. I would recommend trying Al's, especially if you have never tried Al's Italian Beef."}
{"text":"As you may have guessed, I am not Italian, nor am I from Chicago... having said that, I have been to Chicago & I do love a good Roast Beef sandwich with Giardineira. I was so excited to try Al's. I ordered the Dipped \"Big Al\" with extra Beef &  large Buffalo Bleu Fries. I was disappointed.   The Big Al, even with extra beef, is not huge. The quality of the roast beef, is better than most bars, but cooked close to medium/well. The Buffalo Bleu Fries, were soggy & the flavors do not blend well together.... it tastes just like it sounds.... it is French Fries with Buffalo wing sauce & a thin Bleu Cheese dressing, poured randomly over them. They tasted like something a drunk bachelor or high school student would make..... not something to be sold at a real restaurant. On the good side, I loved the flavor of their home made Giardineira, spicy peppers & the staff was very helpful & friendly.   My idea of a Italian Beef sandwich, is a fat, butter grilled roll, tons of medium rare Roast Beef, tasty Giardineira peppers & a big cup of Au Jus on the side. The Buffalo Bleu Fries could have been made better by just topping the Fries with a decent Buffalo Wing sauce & Bleu Cheese crumbles..... I also think they should use a higher fryer temperature, so the fries are crispy on the outside.  Al's Chicago Italian Beef, is just a okay restaurant, not a great one. They have a huge menu & I have only tried those 2 items. I think, I will give them another chance after they have been opened longer.....because, a friendly staff goes a long way in my book."}
{"text":"I was planning a luncheon for my office and they had a menu for Al's Beef on hand so I gave them a call to see if they fit into our budget. Rich and Barry were very nice and helped me figure out what would be enough to order to feed our group and stay within budget. We exchanged a few phone calls over a few days, decided on a menu, and they delivered it right on time just before our event started. Everyone in the office loved it and I got a ton of questions about where the food was from and how they had heard such great things about Al's Beef. Based on my experience I give them 5-stars but since I didn't get a chance to try the food, I'll have to go in and taste it for myself :)"}
{"text":"The Italian beef was OK... I do like their bread though. Giardinara could have been better. Service was good. I've had Al's in Chicago and it does not compare. There are better Chicago Italian beef joints in town. Little bit on the pricey  side too."}
{"text":"Ugghhhh....if you have ever lived in Chicago or even visited then you know that my review is real.  They have made a mockery of the real Al's Beef and all the food in Chicago, I tried the beef and the sausage,  the food was terrible the peppers were mushy, I would not ever return, not even for a cup of water and this is the desert where it gets over 115 degrees in the summer. I still can't get that taste out of my mouth.  I will stick with Hot Dog Heaven  in Henderson when I want to eat a close  to Chicago beef sandwich or sausage or hotdog."}
{"text":"My boyfriend's family is from Chicago and coincidentally his name is also Al, short for Alex. We spotted this place yesterday coming back from shopping and put it on our to do list. It just so happened we had to drive near the area again earlier today and he wanted to stop in for a sandwich. We ordered the Big Al dipped, with both types of peppers. I took one bite and almost had to go order a drink! I can handle spicy but this jolted my taste buds into a frenzy. I enjoyed the decor inside and they have plenty of places to sit.   Major points for having Orange Crush in the soda fountain! The prices were also very customer friendly. We will be back again soon to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Food was okay, portions were lacking.  If I am going to be charged $12 for a sausage and very little meat, there better be meat.  $1 sausage and 4oz meat does not add up.  I paid extra for cheese and peppers..one pepper, one.. really, bro your picture shows tons of peppers and cheese everywhere.  I can eat an 8 oz Outback special for $20 or a small sub with fries and drink for $15.  FYI instead of having the girl cleaning and mopping half the restraunt to close that side at 6pm, have her outside spinning a sign to get business."}
{"text":"07/16/16 DUNCH  Actually, it doesn't close until July 28.   http://vegas.eater.com/2016/7/12/12157462/holy-cow-al-s-beef-from-chicago-is-outta-here  And I wish we had gone here more than this one time. Fantastic french fries. Not the super crisp kind (my fave) but delicious nonetheless. And the beef sandwiches are great. We took some tamales home (cuz don't think we've ever had Chicago tamales before). Sad it's closing."}
{"text":"Once again, Groupon led me to a great place to grab a quick, delicious dinner!  My wife and I really enjoyed the signature sandwich...which indeed is the main attraction.  The hot dog and burger were also tasty, and our order didn't take long.   I've already recommended this place to friends, and I have no doubt that I may see myself there again soon."}
{"text":"I was up here today hanging out and was hungry for something different.  I cruised past this place, slammed on my brakes, and whipped into the parking lot at a high rate of speed.  After throwing the car in park, I made a fast dash for the inside.  Something you should know about me:I love a good hot dog, and this place has em!    They have a great menu selection of Hot Dogs (ALL beef too....tasty!) sandwiches and burgers...AND the prices are AWESOME!  I got an all beef hot dog, with fries and a coke.  Grand total?  $5.34!   Plus, you can get booze here if you like.  They also have TV screens in here, and at the time, they had on some football games, which was nice.  It's a nice place because I feel like its relaxed enough to enjoy a nice meal with a friend here, yet not to barish or uptight that you can't relax and have a decent meal.  Plus, the prices are great too!  What a great way to spend a saturday afternon.  I would gladly return to this place...prices are awesome, food is great, and the place is not typical pretentious Scottsdale!  wooohoooo!"}
{"text":"All the authentic taste that a franchisee can offer!  If you like soggy, limp, GREASY fries cooked in oil that is well under temperature, hot Giardinera that is barely mild, and dry beefs that still horribly dry even when \"dipped\", then Al's is for you!  If you like great Chicago food, then go to Windy City. THIS is the best in Chicago? Bull. BULL. I simply cannot believe that anyone who adores this place has ever eaten in Chicago based in the food we ate.  I've never been to Chicago. That's a good thing because if I did, I would be as big as a Superfan.  I absolutely love Chicago style food. Pizza, beefs, dogs, oh, and pizza. We try every Chicago oriented place that we can find.  Three sandwiches, two large fries, and a drink: $35.  Meh. That's all I can say. The \"large\" fries and the \"large\" cheddar fries were not the same size. They were limp and soggy. We didn't know how \"dipped\" they serve their sandwiches compared to other places, so I ordered two of them with gravy on the side and mine dipped.  (I don't care how soggy the bread gets, my wife and son do.) When she showed us the size of the gravy cup, I asked for another two because that wasn't nearly enough to replicate dipped at home.  I was then invited to buy two more if I wanted more.  Really? I just spent thirty five dollars on food, but that wasn't enough to warrant two extra cups of something that literally costs you nothing. There is no way that amount of au jus could make a dipped sandwich. I find it incredibly hard to believe that what I had last night would fly in Chicago and would be considered \"the best in Chicago\". It was good, not great. I can totally believe that everyone behind the counter had been to Chicago the same number of times that I have.   To sum up, those people need to be retrained on how to cook fries and they need to appreciate the words that will keep the doors open: \"customer service\".   The mom and pop places like Windy City Beefs and Dogs sure do."}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service. Great burger. The chese fries were good. A tad too much cheese for me. Next time I'll see if I can have the cheese on the side. Overall a good meal. More than you'll pay at a mcking in the box type joint, but better flavour and quality."}
{"text":"Service was fast and food was hot. Messy eating. Fries weren't good, they were greasy. The beef and sausage lacked flavor and the hot peppers weren't. My expectations weren't met. Pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch. There's a reason this place is famous. Really fantastic sandwich. I had the same sandwich that won best sandwich on that Man vs Food show - absolutely delicious.   The owners are awesome family franchisees who were friendly and accommodating. The restaurant was gorgeous and immaculate as well. For a fast-casual restaurant, this place seemed pretty upscale and professional. The truth is, this is a very small chain based out of Chicago with only a few locations outside of IL... and only one in Arizona so far.   You can't go into this thinking \"Cheesesteak\" (not that you would)... it's a really flavorful italian beef. You also have to expect that the bread is going to get a little soggy from the meat juices. The bread they use is great and even though I let my sandwich sit for a bit, it didn't get too soggy at all. Just soaked up the flavors a bit - only the last bit of bread at the end was a little wet.   The fries were hand cut (the owner was proud of this - as he should be), and delicious. Know that you can order your fries however you like them - regular, crispy, no salt or extra salty.   I hope they open more locations - this one delivers around the area, so that's rad. Makes me wish I lived closer. I'm definitely going back to try a dog - haven't had one in awhile. I just got back from a trip to Chicago too, so it will be fun to compare. So far, it's spot-on. The closest thing to this I can think of is Luke's which is different. Both are good.  I really don't understand some of the negative reviews here... this place is immaculate, everyone is nice, and the food is awesome. Italian beef might not be for everyone, but there's something for everyone here."}
{"text":"Did I taste a tomato base in the au jus?  Totally missed the mark on proper flavor here at Al's. Not sure who could possibly give positive reviews on their Beef."}
{"text":"The name carries a bit of weight so before I even glanced at a review I decided to make a special trip to the infamously famous Al's Beef.  I wasn't dissatisfied with the service, the store was packed for lunch always a healthy sign for a restaurant, but the soda machine counter was dirty with splashes of other peoples drinks on it, the tables were as well, not mad but cleanliness has to be a passion for a new restaurant in this town.  As for the food it was painful to read the reviews and know the history the name takes on and while I was sat there I expected a signature taste or combination with flavors, and I tasted nothing but dry vegetables, and bread.  The beef hot dogs were super tasty, I would be happy eating them anywhere from Chicago to Portland I was happy with the beef.  I gave it a 3 stars, I will definitely be seeing them again soon, cause its located in a wonderful business park.  By the way the fries weren't bad."}
{"text":"The first night I went here I had an Italian beef sandwich.  I thought there was something wrong with it because it had a strange flavor, but then I heard from  other people that went there that their sandwich also had a strange flavor.  The beef was also powdery.  Not sure what is going on with this, but it is not good.  We also ordered Chicago style hot dogs.  They are not Chicago style which is what I would expect from a company that is from Chicago.  It did not have a poppy seed bun.  It did not have a pickle spear.  It did not have tomatoes."}
{"text":"My MIL and I drive by this spot quite a bit and one day we were hungry and trying to find something to eat, she suggested we try someone new and go here.   I have had Italian beef sandwiches before, but it's been a long time. I decided to do a italian beef with cheese and hot giardinera (extra) combo which came with a fountain drink and a small fry. I ordered my sandwich \"dry\" with the \"gravy\" (au jus) on the side and for a sammie that was supposed to not be dipped in the beef jus, it came fairly wet that as I was unraveling the paper, it was dripping. It made it messy to eat. I wish there was a paper plate option. The flavor of the beef and giardinera was good though. I would skip adding cheese next time as it was a thin layer that didn't add any thing to it at all.   My MIL got a combo as well, but with Italian sausage and sweet peppers. She liked this. The sweet pepper was more like a roasted pepper so I may get a sandwich one of these days with both.   The fries are one of  my favorite kinds - natural cut with skin on. Whats unfortunate is they didn't fry it hot enough and it was just tasting of fryer oil as it sucked it up. My MIL ordered cheese fries but they didn't give her that as the order was entered wrong for another small fry. I love fries and never really leave any behind, but we tossed a majority of ours away.   I might try it again as my MIL likes American food and we pass this often. Hopefully the fries would be better next time and they can keep a dry sandwich dry."}
{"text":"Everyone is definitely right on their reviews, the flavor is ok at best. The meat didn't have a lot of flavor/seasoning to it. The fries were mushy. We ordered a sausage sandwich and I swear to god it was just a dry sausage link in a bun. No sauce, no peppers, no NOTHING. Who the hell serves it like this!!!!  I don't know why I'm giving it 2 stars, maybe because the employees were nice when we ordered.   This place is a joke!  Pops on Decatur is far better than this place."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  The beefs here are not great like they claim.  Quality of bread was stale and the beef was tasteless.  Better off going to Windy City Beefs N Dogs than come here.  Won't be returning for sure."}
{"text":"There's a sign inside of Al's that reads, \"The Best Sandwiches in America.\" That title must have been self proclaimed. The BEST sandwiches in America? Hardly!  I work in North Scottsdale and know that the area is saturated with restaurants, particularly sandwich shops. I have my pick of the litter, so to speak, but on this day I dropped in on Al's, which I'd heard was new to the area. Someone in my office had tried the place so I figured I'd give it a go. The restaurant itself is nice, afterall, it's North Scottsdale and everything there is just a little bit nicer than everywhere else. I have no qualms with the decor. It's the food and the service I take issue with.   Now, I used to work in the food industry, albeit, fast food, but food nonetheless. I know what it's like to serve people since I was a cashier. A cashier should reflect the face of the business, and a positive one at that, if they hope to make any money. The cashier who greeted me at Al's was anything but friendly. She was cordial but bordering on being annoyed, either at me directly or over the fact that she had to work that day. Regardless of her reason, she made me feel like I was a burden to her, instead of feeling welcome.   I'd taken a quick look at the menu, which was pretty basic. There were french fries in various states of being drowned in either bleu cheese or nacho sauce. No thanks, I passed on those. There were hot dogs, sausage and beef sandwiches, their signature dish. I, however, decided to take a healthier route and went with the char-grilled, grilled onion chicken sandwich for around six bucks. Everything is a la carte there, as there are no \"value meals.\" Fine. I paid my $6 and got a glass of water. I sat down and waited for my order to come up....and I waited, and waited. Finally, after 15 minutes, (which to me, seems like a long time for one chicken sandwich) it came up. This better be a darned good chicken sandwich, I thought to myself.  I unwrapped the foil wrapper and dug in. The roll was light and fluffy but that's where the good stuff ends. The onions were cut in such a way that they all fell out of the sandwich. Had they been able to stay on the sandwich they may have lended some flavor to it.The chicken itself was dry and tasteless. If it wasn't for the fact that it was drowned in ketchup and mustard (dripping down my arm) there would be no flavor at all. What really bothered me the most was the dry texture of the chicken coupled with the dryness of the roll. I had to take sips of water to keep my mouth from drying out.   Overall, my experience at Al's was not so good. The service was mediocre and the food was even worse. Even though I only tried one thing on the menu I am not tempted to go back to try anything else. I have to believe that if this sandwich was of bad quality then the rest of their food will be the same. I'm sorry to say, but there were no redeeming qualities about the sandwich shop that claims to have \"The Best Sandwich In America.\""}
{"text":"This place certainly is hyped and is well worth the trip if what you seek is italian beef which is done fairly well and is one of the best that I've had.   However if you're looking for real Chicago style hot-dogs, this place is a big disappointment.    The droopy, slightly cold monstrosity they put in front of me on a bun would never pass must in Chicago, nor anywhere else for that matter.  Want Italian Beef?   This is your joint.    Chicago-style hot-dogs?   Luke's down the street does them far better!"}
{"text":"I promise this will be my final review on Al's.  My last review commended them on their Beef sandwich....ok...so heres the thing... If you get there at the right time of the day (when they open when everything is fresh and the beef hasent been sitting in hot water all day) you get a good beef sandwich(as long as you add the peppers for taste..which btw they charge you for),     however if you get there around 5pm the beef is soggy and tasteless.... sorry michelle and Burt but I gotta tell it how it is.  Now for a simple thing like a hot dog.... ok, so the dog is small, taste is everything....theres the key word....taste....  So heres the thing....if you order a hot dog, tell them exactly how you want the condiments, otherwise you will end up with a hot dog saturated in relish or other ingredients....now some people might like a little hot dog with their relish, but not me.  Now, lets get to Al's redeeming quality....the fries......  So heres the thing..... if you want overly salted well done fries then dont say anything, but if you want golden fries with salt to your liking(like the picture they show), then ask them to not cook them as long and NO SALT!  I have had several friends go to Al's and unfortunately have not had good reviews from them so I will let people read the reviews and decide for themselves.  Overall, if you want to stop at a hot dog joynt and have to dictate exactly how to prepare your food, then Al's is the place for you.  I wish I could suggest a good hot dog place but I just havent found one yet so if anyone has any VALID suggestions..... please share.  I will be moving from Scottsdale in a few months and when I do chances are I wont be back to Al's because it simply is not worth going out of the way for.  Al's is simply not consistent and I hate spending good money on bad food.  The owners (btw) are very nice, but nice doesnt bring the customers back  The decision is yours.....try it or dont try it but until then.......  Bon Appetite'"}
{"text":"So glad to find Al's in Las Vegas! Great service. Best. Sandwich. Ever. Order it dipped. Original Al's can be proud of this location!"}
{"text":"Hello Italian beef aficionados...this is your Fatman reporting back on my Al's Beef Restaurant experience. I thought it was good! not great, but they are just getting here! My sandwich was the Big Al Italian beef sandwich with both sweet AND hot peppers that was dipped, dropped briefly bread and all, in their signature gravy. Verdict: DELICIOUS! The staff seemed somewhat discombobulated but there were pleasant folk there too. My sandwich was just how I remembered it in Chicago. flavorful, filling and MESSY! Beef and roll were very good. The peppers rocked. The girl at the counter seemed dumbfounded when I reiterated that I didn't want a drink or the fries but oh well."}
{"text":"The parking to this place is a bit funky since it's shared with China buffet. I ordered the regular I'll be in debt and it was good.. I drove across town for this place, I wouldn't make the drive again but if I was in the area I would definitely try their hot dogs next time."}
{"text":"Can I give them ten stars?  I would if I could. My husband and I have been here every single week since they opened. Sometimes he cheats and goes without me through the week and then tries to hide all evidence because he knows how much I love it!  Absolutely great customer service, very clean and OMG of course the food is the reason we come back over and over again. No matter what you order you will not be disappointed. We talk about how lucky we are to live so close to our favorite place to eat. They now recognize us and even know what I'm going to order and what I do want or don't want."}
{"text":"This is a solid economical choice for lunch and a great Italian Beef sandwich. Get yours \"dipped\" if you don't mind a little mess and want more flavor. The interior is also much nicer than you would ever expect from the facade. I will be back again soon...  UPDATE: I went back again this weekend - the Chicago Dog is wonderful."}
{"text":"Glad I used Groupon because this was a very poor excuse of an Italian Beef sandwich. The sandwich should be more appropriately named an Italian Bread Sandwich. If you are used to a quality Italian Beef sandwich like from Portillos you will be dissatisfied with Al's Italian Bread Sandwich. I literally am watching an employee eat as I type and their sandwich is overflowing with meat. I guess their 4.5 ounces of beef the lady told me they put on each sandwich doesn't apply to her!  If you are desperate for a beef I would recommend paying the extra couple of bucks for extra meat. The food is good, they just need to serve it like a real Chicago Italian Beef!"}
{"text":"This place is as far from a Chicago Beef than I've seen here in Las Vegas. Starting out the beef here is packaged and shipped in from Arizona. When I asked one of the girls at the counter about the prepackaged beef she replied \" even the Al's Beef in Chicago gets there beef from Arizona\" hahaaa, are you kidding me? Shes obviously not from Chicago! If you're from Chicago or know Chicago beef sandwiches then you know the beef is cooked fresh daily. The next thing I was disappointed about was the ridiculous prices. I'm not paying over $11 for a beef sandwich. And finally the customer service, the girl at the ordering register was extremely nice and outgoing. The staff you receive your food from are absolutely miserable and unprofessional. In my opinion this place won't last, unless it is supported buy a bunch of people who like overpriced prepackaged beef sandwiches. Sad to hear the word Chicago affiliated with this place :("}
{"text":"Al's Beef is a much needed \"Taste of Chicago,\" according to my husband, who is a native of Chicago.   The dining room is filled with Chicago memorabilia. As someone from San Francisco, it's a bit nauseating to look at, but I digress. It's extremely clean and very casual. Their staff is always friendly and courteous.  The all-beef Vienna Hot dogs have a ridiculous snap when you bite into this world of goodness. Not to be missed is the star of the show--the Italian beef, complete with grilled onions and sweet peppers. My all time favorite item on the menu are the cheese fries--I believe the cheese comes from Wisconsin. The chargrilled burgers are amongst some of the best in town.  If calories did not matter, I would eat here on everyday that ends with 'Y.'"}
{"text":"As anther reviewer mentioned... its not the traditional Chicago Italian beef I'm used too. Its very peppery and I don't even notice the oregano. Was still good and had a great beef flavor... still waiting on portillos to open shop in vegas."}
{"text":"Al's Beef has moved into the the silver diner (as I affectionately call it, the Cyndi Lauper Trailer) on the NE corner of Sahara and Rainbow.   I was blown away by the menu. Not only do they have beef sandwiches, they also have burgers, chicken sandwiches, wraps, a variety of fries, salads, soup, chili (no bean) and TAMALES. Yes, tamales. Since this was my maiden voyage (and this place is literally in my back yard), I may have to give the tamales a go at a future visit.  This is how Al's breaks down if you go with a beef sandwich: Dry. Wet. Dipped. What does it all mean? Thankfully, there is a huge board to the left of the register (and now this review) to explain it all to you. Dry means that it's just the cooked meat without the gravy to the bread (this option comes with a side of gravy). Gravy: yummy juices that drip off the meat, like an au jus. (Al's states: This ain't yo' mama's gravy! and it ain't.) Wet means that the beef goes from the gravy, straight to the bread. Dipped means, wet meat to the bread, then they dip that WHOLE sandwich into the gravy. Next up is cheese, which is a surcharge (trust me, it doesn't need it). Then, you can add on peppers: Homemade Sweet Peppers or Home Spicy Giadineria (also for a small up-charge).  So, how did I order my Al's? I ordered a Regular Beef, DOUBLE-DIPPED with Spicy Peppers. Mama likes it extra soggy, fork & knife ready (still ate it with my fingers and probably used a whole tree's worth of napkins in the process). My mama got a Large Beef, Wet, with Sweet Peppers. The sandwiches were stuffed with meat (and double meat is an option - be legit hungry or plan to enjoy your sandwich a second time if you go that route) and the gravy was dynamite! Peppery, garlicky, not too salty perfection. So good! The meat was obviously moist, thinly sliced, and flavorful. They claim that this is one of the best sandwiches in America and it stacks up there, it's probably the second best beef sandwich I've had on the left (West) coast (2nd to Philippe the Original). East coast sammies, especially in New York and Philly are the business.  Since it was our first visit we order their fries, another add claimed that they are among the Top 10 Fries in the nation. There is a difference is size between regular plain fries and their specialty fries. My mama made the mistake of ordering a LARGE loaded fry and they were big enough to share with three/four people easily. I ordered the Cheese fries. Best FRIES in all of Vegas! My cheese fries were fresh and fried to perfection! They don't go skimpy on the toppings. Every fry got some cheesy lovin'! My mama's fries were loaded with cheese, sour cream, bacon, and onions.   Al's made for a perfect cheat meal! The staff was super friendly. We were greeted as soon as we walked through the doors, the staff explained the ordering process to every person in front of us with a smile, and we were thanked when our to-go order was ready. You can also order ahead of time via phone and they cater as well. Definitely a fan and will be back."}
{"text":"I guess we felt like a hotdog...hahaha. Saw the hot dog man on the corner of the street earlier in the week and needed to grab a quick bite before heading out for errands. I guess this place is known for the beef sandwiches. We will try that next time. Decent vienna beefs.  A little thin, but we scarfed them down. The dogs come with a hand full of fries in the hotdog wrapper.  We ordered fries anyway, because we did not know this. Fries are good.  They remind me of old school steak fries in a steamy kind of way.  They are not crunchy, they are kinda 'limpy' but tasty!"}
{"text":"We were excited to come try Al's Beef Italian sandwich but were not impressed. Menu was hard to read and food was below average with very little flavor."}
{"text":"In the world of Italian beef sandwiches, I am sorry to say that Al's is not the winner...my favourite is still Portillo's....which wins in overall taste, quality, speed and value.   I went there for lunch with my dad after shopping the nearby Home Depot....there was not a soul in there...and overall,  must say that my sandwich was nothing but a greasy mess where I wish my mouth had been double in size to wrestle with this monster...and the fries were nothing to rave about either..."}
{"text":"One thing I will never forget about my childhood, is how I seemed to be the only Vegas kid from Chicago. Teachers would go around asking students where they were born. California, Utah and Arizona seemed to be the most common answers, followed by Hawaii, Mississippi and Louisiana, and coming in third place was foreign countries (particularly Mexico and the Philippines). I was always the unicorn in these scenarios, I even remember a couple of times where students would look at me like \"Chicago? What's that?\" Nowadays, I seem to run into people from Chicago EVERYWHERE around this city. It kinda warms my heart up inside.   Okay, I know everyone is wondering what I was getting at with all of that. Well, a large community of migrants inevitably leads to them bringing the culture of their former locale with them. For many years now, a wide variety of Chicago-related businesses have been popping up all over the place, mostly food related. Just a year or two ago Garrett's Popcorn opened up a location here, and there was even a location of Harold's Chicken a while back (which has since closed) and now, we have Al's.  One thing I would always anticipate whenever a family member came back from a visit to Chicago (they rarely ever took me, but that's a different story entirely) was an Italian Beef from Al's. In all it's dripping wet, sweet and spicy glory. And while I have found good replications of Chicago style pizza, hot dogs and popcorn all around Vegas, I've had yet to find a good replication of an Italian Beef. As much as people praise Amore, I was disappointed with their version of it. Too dry and not even close to enough beef. Chicago Brewing Co. doesn't even have it last I checked. I had figured it was time to give up, until Al's opened.   It's in a building that's had many past lives (once upon a time it was a 50s style diner, and before Al's it was the Bollywood Grill, which holds the distinction as the first place I've ever had Indian food). The ambiance is bright, airy and with a lot of space (which is more than one can say for the original Al's Beef in Chicago) and Chicago sports memorabilia all over the walls. The prices may be steep to some, but with the way the meal fills you up, it's totally worth it.   I got a combo sandwich with italian sausage, provolone cheese and sweet and hot peppers. With a fries and a drink, it came out to be $11.00. Now, I was a bit confused with the \"Dry, Regular, Wet or Dipped\" thing. The last time I went to Chicago, all I remember was them asking me if I wanted it dry or dipped. Apparently, Dry means no juice at all (which is blasphemy), Regular means a little juice (must be for cowards), Wet means a lot of juice and Dipped means dipped in the gravy. I decided to just go on ahead and get mine Dipped. My mother on the other hand got hers wet. Upon receiving the sandwiches, we realized they both had the same amount of gravy. Makes the distinction seem even more pointless.  Now me personally, I LOVED the sandwich. It was just like how I remembered it. And the excess gravy went great with the fries. As for my mom, while she still enjoyed it, she kept on talking about how something was \"off\" about it. I personally didn't comprehend what she meant, but then again I didn't grow up down the street from the original Al's Beef like she did so what do I know?  The Final Verdict  Pros: Delicious, filling and flavorful sandwich. Friendly service. Brings a little slice of \"home\" closer to home  Cons: Confusing designation on the level of gravy Could possibly be underwhelming to those who were born and raised in the Chi (I was just born there so I guess that could be why I don't entirely see where they're coming from)  Return Factor: 10/10. I'm always down for a good Italian Beef."}
{"text":"Got the Regular Al, hot peppers, provolone, dipped.  My tastebuds were doing the truffle shuffle!"}
{"text":"I got 2 Beefs.  I got one double dipped with sweet peppers and 1 double dipped with sweet and hot peppers.  The one with just sweet peppers was kind of bland but the one with Giardinare was very flavorful. It seems to me that the Giardinare has all the flavor and if the gravy had a little bit of that flavor they will be much better.  I've had Italian beefs in Chicago at Johnny's and a few other places and nothing tops Johnny's to me, but this beef with hot peppers came close."}
{"text":"I'm a Chicago North Sider so I was not familiar with Al's from back in my Chicago days.  I have always been a huge fan of Portillos however I had to give Al's a shot.  HAPPY DAY!  Had a beef, dipped, sweet and an order of Cheese fries.  It was the best beef I have had in years.  Hot, juicy and just enough spice to give it a kick without going over the top.  Needless to say I will be back to Al's on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Had the chipotle chicken sand with fries and my hubby had combo beef and sausage....ALL GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"The staff here is very friendly, they greet you when you walk in and they are very helpful when asked about the menu. I ordered the Big Al with sweet peppers and provolone. I planned to take at least half home.. And my fiancé ordered a polish sausage with bacon and cheese. As it always goes, his looked better than mine so I side eyed him till he let me try it! The polish sausage was great, bacon was crispy and flavorful. The Big Al on the other hand... Not so flavorful.. The meat was in terrible need of flavor and salt. I smothered it in ketchup which helped a little, I shouldn't even have had to. I did take home over half of the sandwich, because if nothing else, it was Big. But Al ended up sitting in the fridge for a couple days before I threw him away..."}
{"text":"Nathaniel & the ENTIRE staff were amazing! I spilled my whole tray of food, 3 people cleaned it up for me, insisted that i didnt clean it up, they made me all new food & the food was incredible! Best hot dogs in town & the kindest, friendliest staff ive met here in Vegas! Check them out, you WILL NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Allrighty then...  It's time to poke the pig I like to call \"Controversy\"!  I know it's going to sound like heresy, but I'm just going to come out with it...I like Italian Beef Sandwiches better than Philly Cheesesteaks!  I'll give you a minute to clean up the spit on your screen...there you go...there's still a little to your right...no, right...good, all bright and shiny again!  It's true, I really do!  Not that I don't like cheesesteaks, I just like the full dip Italian Beef (made the right way...the Chicago, stand up at the counter and lean over to keep from getting the drippings on your shoes way), better!  And Al's delivers on the better Italian Beef!  Huge sandwiches, made in every conceivable manner (maybe too many options on the menu, but I suppose someone likes some the of the more esoteric choices), but really, there is only one way to make this sandwich for me...Full Dip, Provolone and hot Giardiniera...chock full of beefy, cheesy, spicy, peppery goodness!  The kind of goodness that mere napkins can't remove...oh sure, they can soak up some of the greasy drips...smear things around on your hands and face a little bit, that sort of thing...but you're going to need a shower after lunch at Al's Beef.  And that's how it should be!  My buddy and I met for lunch last week and we tried the new Al's franchise for the first time.   For first time franchisers (from Chicago, BTW, so they know how these things are supposed to look and taste), they do a nice job...And I should note how nice everyone is at Al's...so...noted!  The service was reasonably good, and while they did forget to put Giardiniera on my sandwich, they were quick to give me a couple of cups of their house blend to fork over onto my sandwich...you just aren't getting the entire experience without the pickled peppers!  My buddy and I sat and talked and the sandwiches quickly disappeared, along with a pretty decently made, tasty side of fries...I know, I know...I can't eat that way every day (or really, every week) if I want to live to a ripe old age of 149...but I'm not sure that I want to live that long if I can't get my Italian Beef sandwich from time to time!  So my new strategy is to extend my life by forgoing  the cheesesteaks and replacing them with Italian Beef, now that we have a couple of decent places in town (sorry DeFalco's...you know I love you, but, for the love of Jebus, dip my sandwich...don't just give me a little plastic \"sample cup\" of au jus).  Of course, that life extension strategy will only work if the mob doesn't come after me with torches and pitchforks for writing that a good Chicago Italian Beef Sandwich is better than a Philly Cheesesteak!"}
{"text":"Wasn't big on Al's in Chicago, but figured I owe it to myself to try it out here.  First, the place was busy at lunch, which isn't too much of a surprise since the only recently opened.  My order was placed and ready really quick though.  I had the regular (6 inch) beef w/ fries.  My bill was over $10.  I get the price due to supply & demand out here, and maybe even distribution cost from Chicago; but I know I can get a better price elsewhere out here.  The beef itself was just good.  It could've used more flavor, and there just want enough meat.  Even after the fries (which were very good), I almost feel like I could eat a snack; that shouldn't happen after eating a beef.  In all honesty, I've had better out here (and as I said, a cheaper price).  A decent option if you're dying for a beef in that area; but if you're willing to drive a few miles, you can find better.  I'll stick to my current spot in Vegas to get my beef."}
{"text":"Looks like they didn't listen and closed shop.  Too bad because I love the food, whomever was in charge of the hiring shouldn't be allowed anywhere near any business."}
{"text":"I grew up knowing this sandwich as a french dip, but regardless of what Big Al calls it, it is amazing. The beef is incredibly seasoned and tasty and tender. The bun is out of this world. Apparently in Chicago, they're really into au jus -- poured all over it. Even totally dipped in it. For me, just ordering it \"dry\" was way juicy enough. Priced fairly too -- and a regular is LARGE. All in all a terrific sandwich. Service is top notch too. P.S. For those of you from L.A., you may know of Phillipe's, downtown by Union Station. Al's puts Phillipe's to shame. P.S. There are some very negative reviews here. Disregard them. Those folks are not from Earth."}
{"text":"Genuine Chicago food in the middle of the desert.  The girlfriend, a Chi-town native, ordered hers wet and it was dripping with au jus goodness. I, the neophyte, got mine regular and was pleased with the taste of Italian beef and just enough gravy to keep it respectable.   Of course, we couldn't resist a genuine Chicago dog for the road. Many places say they make them, but very few do it right. Steamed poppy seed bun, tomato, sport peppers, kosher dill spear, celery salt... this is the real deal.  The fries are forgettable, but who in the world goes to a Chicago beef joint looking for great fries? This ain't Five Guys, y'all.  Great service on our visit, too. The guy behind the counter took his time to make sure I was placing an order that would bring maximum satisfaction."}
{"text":"I went on Friday the 4/18/16 with a couple of friends for the first time.. I ordered a regular grilled chicken sandwich and some fries. Thinking it would be like any other chicken sandwich it was actually good idk if it was because I was hungry but hey why not try it for selves...there fries are natural cut. The service was good and can't complain. Hope the get more business sucks they have to be behind another restaurant...if your not looking you will miss it..."}
{"text":"Had lunch at this place Sept 19 wanted to see if the hype is really true bought 2  Italian beef combos, 1 with hot peppers the other with sweet peppers, small fry and drinks. I asked for wet since I'm used to Portillo's beef sandwich wet with au jus. These beef sandwiches were not fit for man or beast, it was extremely salty and the pepper looked like a mix of sports pepper and sriracha and the texture of the beef looked like reconstituted beef jerky. I took 2 bites to make sure it wasn't a fluke but the entire filling and gravy tasted like it was made with salt brine. The fries were soggy and greasy. I took the order back to the pick up counter and asked for a manager to tell them the food was inedible but all I got was a counter person taking my food and dumping it in trash can no one bothered to make things right so I took the other sandwich and tossed in the trash where it belongs!!!!!!!! CUSTOMER SERVICE AFTER YOU PAY FOR YOUR FOOD IS NON-EXISTENT. Definitely will not return to this choke & puke"}
{"text":"This place was just OK. I was excited to go because my boyfriend and I love Portillos and Windy City Dogs. But, unfortunately it did not compare.   We both got small Italian beef sandwiches with spicy peppers. My boyfriend liked it but I thought it was just OK. The pickled vegetables inside weren't the flavor I was used to and they overwhelmed the taste of the beef. The bread was pretty good.   We also got a tamale which was pretty much a joke, it was microwaved and served directly in the plastic wrapper like it was bought in the frozen food section at the grocery store.  The chili fries were pretty good, I liked that the chili did not have beans. My boyfriend also liked his chili dog."}
{"text":"From the looks of the outside, I thought this place was a diner. It was more of a fast food joint unlike others.  Original beef sandwich for me after the cashier generously took the time to explain to me about the sandwiches and a brief about the Al's restaurant chain.  I've never been to Chicago or had a Chicago-style sandwich like this so I had no frame of reference to determine if they were good or not. On it's own, nothing special - bread, meat, peppers, & au jus. I think there's an option to have the wich soaked in the au jus; I'll have it next time.   Fries were good too, by the way. Fresh cut like In-N-Out, but bigger and tastier.   3 stars because I like french dips and for the really polite staff."}
{"text":"Well OK, this was a complete surprise! Didn't even know a place like this existed in Las Vegas. Corner of Sahara and Rainbow. My man, who is a native of Chicago mentioned after the gym to go grab some sandwiches at Al's Beef.   What a treat! Authentic as it can get in Vegas!  I ordered the Italian sausage dog with fries and he got the Vienna  hot dog combo. Oh my goodness, what a tasty sausage! Fresh cut fries...and the famous dipping sauce was a piece of heaven in my mouth! Love the bread too.  The diner was very clean, courteous staff and a 'killer' Tin Ceiling! Love the ceiling!! Quite sexy for a diner.  But Im not sure why it was empty? You all need to go grab some lunch here and the authentic taste of Chicago. I promise you will leave with a satisfied full belly."}
{"text":"Transplanted Chicago area native here. In my 60+ years, I've had beef sandwiches all over Chicagoland, where it was the original take-out fast food long before McD's.  I never even heard of Al's until it was on that Travel Channel show with the slob who goes around the USA gorging on local dishes until he pukes.  I learned about their Scottsdale AZ place so I went 20 miles out of my way for a beef sandwich there last time in Phoenix. The reddish juice was the first red flag; it isn't the norm for IB.  First bite...the flavor was very weak...Strike 1.  It was very greasy; highly undesireable in a beef sandwich...Strike 2.  Then there was the tough, almost stale, bread  Strike 3.  Sorry, Al's...you're \"out\".  In a blind test of Chicago IB fans,  Al's probably wouldn't even be ID'd as Italian beef.  Of all the beef I've ever had, I rate Al's as mediocre to poor.  So its no surprise the place has wall-to-wall, in-your face \"World's Best Italian Beef\" decor and life-sized \"The Italian Stance\" posters. If it lived up to the hype, that would be unnecessary.  I'll guess stick with Portillo's; a decent IB for factory-made, also in Scottsdale, and pine for the day that Buona's Beef; the best chain store IB I've had, someday expands outside the Chicago area.  Or sample some of the other places in Phoenix that claim to serve Chicago-style Italian beef."}
{"text":"My roommate and I decided to give this a try. He likes Italian beef more than I do. It wasn't that busy at 530pm, compared to the traffic going into the Asia Buffet next door. Ordered the beef, dipped, with cheese only (I\"m not a pepper fan). With drink it was $9.44. Order up in about 5 minutes, and it looked pretty good, a little small for the price. Flavor was just OK, nothing too exciting. Couldn't tell if there was even cheese on it.  My roommate said the same thing as me.....it was ok but not worth coming back for. He likes the sandwiches at Parma."}
{"text":"As much as i love als.  The food and service is going downhill totally in this location.  I was the first customer in line when they opened the doors 2.5yrs ago.  The staff has no sense of urgency at all.  We waited 28 minutes for our order on a monday night.  It was dead 3 other people in the place.  4 workers.  The food came out, my wifes sandwich Ice cold and barely any meat on it.  I waited for them to remake hers another 6 min so mine got cold as well.   Our fries hard as a brick ice cold.  $43 for 2 beefs with peppers 1 drink and a hot dog.  We upgraded our combo fries to chili cheese and its not an upgrade u pay full price it was a .40 cent discount lol.  Im not cheap for food EVER.   Anyone who knows me will tell u that.  But your prices are ridiculous for the small portions u are serving.  I think you should take a trip to chicago and try MR BEEFS on harlem and irving.  Or any other location. I love chicago beef and ur ruining als name.  Sincerely."}
{"text":"I got a beef with sweet peppers and provalone, wet style. I also got fries. The fries were sadly the best part of the meal. While i must say that the service was superb and very friendly, the sammy was flavorless and soggy. I know how to order these, and it was too soggy. Idk that I will set out to come here again, but if someone wanted to eat here, I could live with it"}
{"text":"Without doubt this is the best Italian beef in Arizona. Get it dipped with sweet and hot and you will be in heaven!"}
{"text":"Once again, my fellow lunch partners and I were looking for something different and then we came across this place. Staff was very helpful since it was a our first time. I had their beef sammie dry with hot peppers. They recommended to get it wet, but I am not a fan of soggy bread and the mess. Also tried their loaded fries and their bleu cheese fries. Loaded fries are pretty tasty,but I think I'm going to ask for them to go easy on the green onions. The Bleu Cheese Fries were pretty good,but I think next time, I may request some bacon bits on them. Bacon does make everything better.   Overall, everything was good. However, one of my lunch buddies did order which seemed to take a while, not quite sure what the delay was since they were not busy when we arrived. This place is fairly new so I'm gonna give the staff the benefit of the doubt and that they're still learning the ropes. This location has had different food venues and I hope that Al's is here to stay."}
{"text":"Better get here while the going is still good, for, lamentably, according to signs posted throughout the restaurant, due to a lack of customers, this bastion of finest Italian beef is set to close after July 28th.  And, while the air conditioning was either off or not functioning well on my latest visit, and no forks were available again--and this time not able to be replenished--the food was just as great tasting as before.  Every bite of a dipped 8-inch Big Beef with cooked Sweet Green Peppers and Provolone Cheese that had been soaked with well-seasoned Au Jus Gravy, was divine, while skinny Skin-On French Fries were fresh and delectable bathed in Cheese Sauce and also as part of a conglomeration of ingredients, including beef and Giardiniera, that graced an order of Gypsy Fries, which appears on the not so \"Secret Menu\" that can be accessed on the business's website.  Even downed cuts of a Half Boat of a Tamale that was covered with smooth Chili and White Onions greeted my taste buds with a burst of unexpected yet exciting flavors.    Service was again friendly, and seating comfortable enough.  The food is worth it, folks.  Come on in to sample it before it soon leaves town."}
{"text":"Wow! What a sandwich!  I've been wanting to try a Chicago style beef sandwich for a while now and Al's did not disappoint.  Ordered the big al dipped, with giardiniera and a small chili cheese fries. The bread kept a good chew even with it being dipped in gravy. The beef was full of flavor and the giardiniera just put it over the top. The chili cheese fries were bomb! Will be back even though I live on the other side of town."}
{"text":"On our road trip across America we had made it a point to stop by the original Al's in Chicago. Man was this a foodie experience for the ages! Hands down one of the best sandwiches that I have ever eaten.  Thank God that we no longer have to travel to the windy city to enjoy a real italian beef!!  Straight up the only way to eat one of these bad boys is with hot peppers, provolone cheese and dipped. Sloppy goodness! (My mouth is watering as I write about this!) I Make sure that you say you want it dipped! For all my west coast people it's the same thought process as ordering a dipped roast beef at Phillips in LA but 1000x better!   It's just like I remember it when we ate at the original Al's in Chicago.   On another note: You don't have to assume the \"position\" in Vegas (as seen on the food network) since they don't have high counters like the ones in Chicago.   I can't talk about anything else on the menu as all we eat here is the aforementioned messy monstrosity of a sandwich that is a dipped big Al's Italian beef sub..   Al's is a mandatory must eat for every red blooded American and is a shoe in for being one of the top 10 sandwiches in the country..."}
{"text":"Great to have Al's Beef in my neck of the woods. Greeted with a welcome from behind the counter....nice touch! Ordered 4 big beef with hot giardinara, dipped and 2 Chicago Style Dogs....to go. Needless to say....the sandwiches were the best Italian Beef in Las Vegas!!!!! Although, I did have to add extra hot giardinara (Vienna Brand) to my sandwiches at home.  My wife loved the Chicago Style Dogs....the only style hot dog she will eat.  Yes...I did eat the 4 beef sandwiches in one day....when I'm jonesing....I don't fool around."}
{"text":"What to say?  Meh!  Although it might be 2.5 stars, but it's for sure not 3.  One more place that I can add to my list of things that don't live up to the hype.  Had the Italian Beef and Chicago Dog.  First the beef.  You could tell the beef was pretty good quality and to my surprise there was more than enough of it for my tastes.  We ordered the sandwich dipped so the good news is that it made the bread edible.  Had it not been that way I expect the clearly stale bread would have been on the inedible side.  As for flavor about the only thing you could taste was the dip.  The beef had no discernible flavor on it's own.  Having said that I found the dip to be high on the pepper side and as such I got to taste it for several hours later.  Now the hot dog.  I don't claim to be an expert on Chicago cuisine, but I'm pretty sure a Chicago dog includes  celery salt.  None here...nada, zip, zero.  Oddly enough that little missing ingredient makes a lot of difference.  The dog also comes with fries.  Now most places on the planet the fries come on a separate plate/bag/cup/whatever.  Not here.  Fries come wrapped in the paper that contains the dog.  I wasn't digging this little innovation.  There are all kinds of signs/posters in the place telling you about how good the sandwich is and who says so.  Also on one of those TV food/travel channel competitions the beef sandwich was named the winner for the midwest region as the best sandwich in America.  As of this writing the overall winner hasn't been named but if the beef sandwich comes even remotely close to winning, I'm going to throw my TV out the window.    This place isn't even remotely close to where I live, but since I was in the neighborhood we stopped in.  I wouldn't make a special trip, but I might give it a try again (just to see if I can \"get it\") if I'm ever back in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Much improved beef sandwich from my last visit.  Still prefer Windy City but I would stop here if I was in the neighborhood"}
