{"text":"Most of Montreal's Jewish community black market money is spent here. $10 and up for a sandwich is quite excessive for a fast-food Israeli restaurant. The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because they prepare the best Shawarma in town. Why must we always get gouged for average kosher food??  Oh, and you have to try their 'Amba' (tangy mango sauce) and get loaded on the free spare pita corners."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, and great food! It has a nice modern updated look, kind of like a modern diner. Also has a terrasse and televisions with trending live sports. As a kosher restaurant, it is comparitively cheap but some items are somewhat pricey, like their asian dishes. Overall the portions are generous, and the quality is good. Service can take some time, but it is worth the wait in the end. If I could recommend some of their dishes, it would be the mergez baguette, shish taouk laffa or a classic shawarma pita. As for their sauces, I like their creamy and tangy burger sauce, and their insanely spicy sauce if you're up to it."}
{"text":"Great kosher restaurant. I really love their new menu with all the Chinese food options. Great for a quick bite or to sit down. I would definitely recommend the general tao chicken and the won ton soup! Yum!"}
{"text":"Good was very good.  I had the General Tao Chicken with Won Ton Soup.  My wife had the Shwarma Plate was pretty good.  Service is HORRIBLE.  You need to order and pay at register than go back to individual stations depending on what you order.  Chinese station, Shwarma Station and Sandwich section.  Very disorganized and frustrating getting soup than need to wait for rest of meal.  Would come back, but not first choice."}
{"text":"Good kosher food is hard to find in Canada. It's near impossible in Toronto, let alone Ontario.

I've found one can find good Kosher food in Ottawa, but Montreal is a whole different ball game.

Last time I was at Chez Benny was about 6 years ago and I'm still thinking about their Shawarma in a Laffa. I couldn't finish it and I sure as hell wanted to. Mind you, I did have a fantastic lunch for the next day. I'd put it on par with Doctor Laffa in Toronto. But it is delightful to know that there is a great option the next time I travel to Montreal (which I am severely due for).

It seems from their website that they have upgraded since I have been there. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I was dragged here by a friends with dietary restrictions. I was pretty excited to get some falafel but was unfortunately let down. The highlight was the falafel itself. It was tasty and made with green chickpeas which was nice for a change. Everything else was underwhelming. The pitas come straight from a bag without being warmed up. The salads were put in first and the falafel on top so after a few bites, all you have left is salad. Some of the salads were so salty that I couldn't eat it. Compared to other falafel I've had, it was pretty bad.
It is overpriced for what it is but I was explained that this is the norm for kosher restaurants. I would not return to this restaurant."}
