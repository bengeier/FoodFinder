{"text":"Gorgeous new eatery with very friendly staff! Super cute decor, and their portions are really large.

Awesome variety in their menu as well, and deeeeeeelicious coffee."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Lovely interior design and very cozy atmosphere and ambience. The food is fantastic- I loved the french onion soup and the tartines! I also got a lavender creme brulee for desert, that was hands down the best creme brulee I've ever had! I'll be definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered the croq with potatoes and they were excellent. Dining area is full of natural light. Our waitress was attentive and we did not wait long for our meal. I highly recommend and look forward to returning soon to try their dinner entrees."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service! Came here for lunch with my family and tried a special with a crepe and a Florentine tartine, all of which tasted fantastic."}
{"text":"Such a great place! Very good interior design and the food is so tasty! I lived in Paris for a long time and this restaurant really brings me back to the best French food I had over there! I particularly recommend the \"soupe a l oignon\" and the \"crepe parisienne\"!"}
{"text":"Love the food here! Have been here maybe 8 times since they opened. The lavender creme brûlée is my favorite. The lemon curd crepe is also very good.  My husband likes the croq with the egg on top. The only criticism I have is the coffee isn't great. Which is very unusual for a French cafe. Normally French cafes have very strong good coffee. I wish they would switch to a high quality roaster and offer French press coffee."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go here - it looks cute from the outside,  reading all the reviews it sounded great, and I love small intimate restaurants. But it was underwhelming.

The decor is a cute but the ambiance seems to be lacking something. Perhaps some candlelight would help. But the decor wasn't enough to overlook the so-so food.

We came for dinner and had the Boeuf Bourguignon and the Cassoulet. the boef bourguinon was good, not exceptional, but good and yet I was still hungry. My husband's reaction to the cassoulet was \"I just paid $28 for canned beans.\" It needed a lot of help in the seasoning, perhaps some thyme and more onion would have helped.

I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Loved this place the minute I first stepped inside and was even more in love once I experienced the quality and presentation of the food! Charming atmosphere and friendly service. I will definitely be back. Pro tip: do what I wasn't smart enough to do and eat some of the toppings off your tartine with a fork before trying to pick it up with your fingers. (The sandwich is fairly large and the wooden board, while lovely, is quite small, so it won't catch any of your droppings.)"}
{"text":"This restaurant was perfect for a date night! Quaint, unique spot with a charming atmosphere. They offer a special menu including two entrees, a bottle of wine, and two desserts for under $50. The server was attentive and very helpful with menu suggestions. I took all of his recommendations and was incredibly satisfied with the entire experience. I would definitely recommend checking out this spot if you find yourself in the area, or make the trip down to Willy street if you live further away, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food and great, very friendly service. Ordering at the counter is a nice change that helps speed things up, particularly for those with limited lunch time. I will be back often."}
{"text":"Cute cafe with a somewhat limited number of traditional French options. I ordered a dish which was essentially avocado toast, and the croque monsieur sandwich my BF got was decent but I would mostly go for the cute atmosphere, and not the food."}
{"text":"Came here Sunday for brunch. It has been on my list for awhile now. I had the bacon and goat cheese, spinach crepes. They were $10 and they were good. I would not say this place compares to my Madison favorites and i am not in a hurry to come back. Would i suggest it for some home-style cooking? Yes. The portions are also very correct. Pricing is super fair. My boyfriend really liked his omelette. We will be back. 

The place is super cute and cozy. Lot's of interesting things to look at inside. I found their trendy looking silverware fun, but not that use-able."}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot for what I want. And what I want is perfectly made crepe with savory and fresh ingredients, warm arrive, and a glass of lovely French wine. Unassuming, intimate atmosphere and lovely menu and food."}
{"text":"Incroyable!

I have experienced Chez Nanou and La Kitchenette...magnifique! BOTH venues are nearly identical to one another and I hope both provide \"un petit peu\" of a true French dining experience!

I have only enjoyed brunch in my two visits...and dinner is going to happen someday. SOON I HOPE! It must! However, brunch is scrumptious. Whether Johnson Brothers Coffee (JBC), a cappucino, or tea, it's all brewed , crafted, and steeped wonderfully and tastes marvelously. I dined on apple french toast and a special vegetarian mushroom combination quiche in my visits. I had a friend come along the second visit who devoured an anchovie and black olive quiche, and they RAVED! The food easily deserves all 5 stars! Simple, but divine! I easily would have dined on a second serving of the mushroom quiche.

Staff service is perfect as well! Weekend brunches are sparsely attended, so you have an intimate dining experience as most tables seat 2-3, and some 4. I should dine solo sometime, as I could easily see myself sitting for a while, sipping on a coffee, dining, and reading my book...ah 'la perfection'! In my second visit, our host took extremely good care of us, made sure we always had enough water and coffee in our glasses and cups, and was keen enough to tantalize my guest and I with a dessert suggestion. Considering it was Bastille \"weekend\", we savored three tasty macaroons, humorously referred to as \"Macrons\", in the French flag colors. 

Prices are also reasonable for brunch. $9-14ish per plate will see me returning soon! Not many of my friends enjoy such carefully crafted food experiences, and so many people are not aware of LK, but La Kitchenette is an establishment I highly, highly recommend!

Allons-y!"}
{"text":"This place felt like a lunch spot from the ambiance and the menu that only contains a few true entrees, but don't let that fool you. The entrees are plentiful and delicious, at least the two we had were! 

We tried a couple of the wines. A white from Bordeaux and a red that I can't remember specifically. They were good. 

The French onion soup was nice to start with. Lots of cheese!

The entrees we had were the Chicken (Poulet a la Normande) and beef stew (Boeuf Bourguignon). At $15, the chicken is a great deal--big leg, large serving of potatoes, and a small salad. Everything was delicious. 

For the beef stew ($21), you get a little less. What you do get is absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked. 

The spot is very cozy--not much space between tables and chairs. Got bumped a few times and people's coats were being knocked off chairs here and there, but it kind of added to the charm in a weird way. 

The server was a bit odd and quite slow when it came to drinks. We were discussing how they got that right in terms of French service--reminded us of when we were in cafes there trying to get another glass of wine! 

Overall a charming and relatively inexpensive dinner. Food was great! Don't come to dinner if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in town and that's saying a LOT in Madison. 

If I could rent a space inside and live there I would. Authentic great tasting French cuisine at a great price. Love it love it love it, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly service, and a cozy atmosphere. We were the only people there one evening during a recent cold snap, so I hope they are usually busier because they're wonderful."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and am always pleased with whatever I've chosen. The menu is on the intimate side with fewer choices than you might get at a larger restaurant but it fits the place and I haven't hit any duds after having tried over half the items on offer.

If you are there for brunch and not sure where to start, why not try the buckwheat crêpes with spinach, bacon, shallots, and goat cheese?"}
{"text":"Came here on a week night. The space is small but very cozy. We sat at one of the tables with the bench seating along the wall. The amount of decorative pillows was a bit overwhelming, and they kept on falling on the floor (oops :-/). The menu is small but had a good variety that everyone can find something to eat. The wine selection is also good and the staff is also quite good at recommendations. We ordered the charcuterie plate, the chicken with rice, the duck confit, and a savory crepe special. The chacuterie plate had a nice variety of cuts. The chicken with rice was fantastic. The rice was creamy and rich with chunks of chicken. Very hearty, perfect for a chilly night. The simple salad on the side also gave it some nice refreshing acidity. The duck confit was under seasoned and I really really wish it was a whole leg confit instead of having the meat pulled and shaped into a ring mold. Overall, still decent. The crepe special reminded me so much of the crepes I would get from a street vendor in Paris. It was nice and thin, with cheese, thin sliced seasonal veggies and proscuitto. Overall, this is a great find for French food in town. Definitely will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Downgrading purely based on service. I came in here for brunch again with my sister and we were not served after being seated. The servers paid more attention to cleaning up an empty table before we had water or menus. After tending to the empty table, servers went back to check how guests were doing that were already eating. We left after 15 minutes of waiting for water."}
{"text":"Our first dining experience there and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  Quaint place with friendly staff.  I appreciated our server asking us if it was our first time dining with them. I feel he was very appreciative of our visit and was very thorough in his explanations of the specials. We shared a delicious appetizer before moving on to savory crepes. The Parisienne was filled with ham, mushrooms and a cream sauce. It was served with a bed of greens. I do wish the greens were dressed with a vinaigrette and goat cheese. The other crepe was filled with spinach, bacon and a sweet goat cheese. Delicious!  We ended our meal with the special dessert of the day. A smooth caramel cream with s slotting meringue  center.  A nice end to a delicious and relaxing meal.  A visit for brunch is in the plans."}
{"text":"This is a lovely small restaurant on Willy Street.

We made dinner reservations for a Friday night, which was good because the restaurant was full when we came in. The decor of the place is really warm and welcoming. There's good lighting and nice touches with plants and notes from previous guests. The place is really made for a dinner for two.

We had a French onion soup for our appetizer, and it was excellent. I ordered the poulet a la normande. Our waiter offered some solid wine pairings for our dishes. The best of my dish were the potatoes, just the perfect flavoring touch. The chicken was also very good and paired nicely with the savory potatoes. The chicken had a very fruity flavoring and just slid off the bone. For dessert we had the creme brulee. The candied portion was nice and firm while the custard was light and airy. Overall a fairly delicious meal."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The food is authentic and DELICIOUS.  Also, the environment in adorable."}
{"text":"Very good brunch. Got the smoked salmon omlette with dill. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Wonderful French coffee house. Great brunch. The soup was great. The green french toast was delicious and the sweet french crepe was wonderful!
The atmosphere was really nice and remided us of small coffee house in Paris."}
{"text":"Wow authenic French cuisine! The staff is friendly, and  multi talented! My server said she is usually in the kitchen! Get the chicken entree ( I don't speak French and I forgot the name)  because wow. Not a dry piece of chicken on that bone, and the sauce was amazing. 
Crepes in the morning too! Comfy cozy lil spot. I'm with it."}
{"text":"A fabulous place to start our weekend! Had the spinach, bacon, goat cheese scramble and LOVED it. Kids devoured the lemon curd crepes. Service was fast and friendly. We will absolutely be going back."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today and left feeling extremely refreshed! Adorable space, nice servers and fresh filling French food. I got the crepe with Brie, prosciutto and an egg and my dining partner got one of the breakfast omelettes. Both came with a delicious salad. The crepe was as good as ones I've eaten in Brittany. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is very close to downtown and very cozy, and great for dates. Staff was friendly and food was excellent. We tried an appetizer, entrees and desserts and all of them are amazing. Food came a little slow but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is in the old Chez Nanou location and has pretty much the same menu as before of homey French classics: crepes, salads, croques, plus a couple of simple dishes. They added some tartines and a couple of more modern takes on the classics. And they kept the delicious French onion soup (which is still delicious) and the creme brûlé.

The location also got a bit of a makeover and now feels brighter and more modern.

Service is attentive. If you liked chez Nanou, you are going to enjoy LA Kitchenette very much!"}
{"text":"Absolutely darling space and even more delightful cuisine!  What a special addition to the Willy Street scene."}
{"text":"We came here on a Wednesday night for dinner and really enjoyed everything about this place. The dinner, service, quality and atmosphere was fantastic. I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a super cute, intimate little restaurant and a great addition to Willy Street's already amazing restaurant scene. The ambience of this place is cozy and just casual enough to be a perfect first date spot. I've been here for dinner and for brunch, both were fantastic. I especially recommend the croque madame on the brunch menu and the chèvre tartine on the dinner menu. Both were fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I went to La Kitchenette for the first time today for breakfast, and it was great! I ordered the basque croq and my boyfriend got the brioche French toast. Our food was delicious and the service was great. We hadn't really heard about the place before today, so we were unexpectedly delighted."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to La Kitchenette without a reservation on a Sunday morning around 9:30. We were seated right away in the cute and comfortable atmosphere. Our server was very sweet and came to check in with us at exactly the right times.The coffee, cappuccino and crepes were delicious. We were definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Brioche French Toast and Americano. Visiting from out of state and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This little place is so cute and the food is amazing. Perfect for lunch or dinner. Excellent for a romantic first date."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch here. The food was tasty and it had a casual but tasteful atmosphere. The space is very, very small, though. I'm not sure I'd even bother trying to eat here at a busy time (weekend brunch, for example) or bring a group larger than two or three."}
{"text":"First time doing brunch at a place, I like to test out the staples to get a good read on how they do things. Today I had scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, bacon, greens, baguette, and split a Nutella crepe. Every. Single. Item. Was. Perfect. The place is also tastefully cute and perfectly decorated to the point that it nearly made me forget about the pain of my Ex making out with some French guys while she was in Paris.

Prices not bad either. I'll be back to try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Such a cute restaurant! I'd never heard of La Kitchenette before dining here, but now I'm a huge fan! It's a very small and cozy space, so I definitely recommend making reservations beforehand. We dined for brunch, and several parties were turned away as the restaurant only fits about 10 tables. It's always a nice sign when the staff is actually from where the cuisine is! I ordered the smoked salmon and dill crepe and felt like I was back in France. Great place for brunch, especially if you're looking for a cozy and quaint dinning experience and want to get away from the craziness of downtown restaurants."}
{"text":"Short menu but everything was yummy!  Great selection of wines. The mini drawings left by customers were cute."}
{"text":"Great dining experience.  Very small place-would def recommend making reservations.  We had the appetizer special: mushroom pie type thing, vegetables with pesto and Swiss cheese baked, fennel soup and toast with tomato and mozzarella.  It was great at $16.  My BFF has a savory crepe with Brie and prosciutto.  I had the croq with ham.  We both agreed mine was much better than his.  For dessert we had the special as well-layer chocolate and hazelnut middle with lady fingers in the outside.  It was really good and a nice portion-a little speedy at $10.  Total dinner(no drinks) was $54 before tip."}
{"text":"I was so sad when Chez Nanou closed, but so happy to see La Kitchenette open in the same space.

The decor is adorable and makes you feel at home (if your home is in the countryside of France and you have a grandmere named Nanick) and the service is very friendly.

I didn't love the croque basque I ordered. It came on just regular-ish wheat bread, was a bit on the soggy side and the flavor combo didn't really meld very well for my taste. But the side salad was really nice with a fresh vinaigrette.

Not a homerun on the first visit, but I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Really cute place on Willy street. We came here for brunch on a weekend morning and it wasn't too crowded. We maybe waited for about 10-15 minutes. The servers are all very nice. Their menu is pretty simple and reminds me of a small French bistro (which I think is what they were going for). They have nice creations for brunch but I wasn't blown away by the food they had. It was good but it wasn't mind-blowing. Overall a decent place to go for brunch, but not outstanding compared to other places."}
{"text":"This is now my go-to place. I love the atmosphere, good service, and out of this world good food. The lemon curd crepe is a must-have for every meal. The potatoes served with their breakfast are to die for. Authentic cappuccinos as well as their plane coffee or superb. The wait staff is courteous and prompt but not pushy if you want to chat a little bit. I hope you enjoy this place as much as I do."}
{"text":"I don't have much in the way of French food to compare this with, except for Chez Nanou, the predecessor to La Kitchenette. Nanou's crepes were heavenly, and the lemon curd like sunshine in a dish. This, sadly, did not come close to the experience. We were prompt at 11 on a Thursday am. and had to call to see if they were open, as the 'Closed' sign was left up. They were. We had our choice of seats, but basically all are 2 or 4 top small kitchenette tables with wooden chairs. There's a long bench seat against the wall. The waiter brought out water without asking, but it was a room temperature water, served in an oversized bottle that my dining companion and I shared. It was uninspiring, particularly in an era where doctors' offices (UW TAC) and my hair salon all have fresh infused water available free for clients. A small detail, but telling. 

Service was decent, unlike other reviews. Of course, we were the only ones there. I think if people are expecting a more conventional 'restaurant' they will be disappointed; this feels a bit more like eating at a friend's house. I get the feeling the kitchen is likely small, with an appropriately small staff (you can hardly have 4 waitstaff sitting around in a place this small) so if a number of people arrive at once, it might be a wait.

The buckwheat crepes were kind of ... meh. Flat and folded like a heavy quesadilla. The filling was nice, a bechamel sauce, potatoes, green onions and bacon. I knew all the ingredients were there. But literally--I think that's all that was there. I suppose one could kindly say, 'it lets the components shine,' because it didn't taste like much was added in the way of seasoning. It was surprisingly filling. A giant, very lightly dressed mixed-greens accompanied it (can one call it salad with just lettuce and a bare vinaigrette?) and provided a nice contrast to the heavy crepe.

My companion had the salmon crepe, where they used a 'cold-smoked' salmon (the menu does not say this). It made for a tepid result between the warm crepe and the cold salmon. Flavor was nice; it just didn't work for me as a combination, but that's because I likely eat too much poached salmon with dill-cream sauce.

My companion loves creme brulee and enjoyed it, but I found the crust on it unpleasant. It turned into a crisp later that shattered in hard chunks and reminded me unpleasantly of slightly burned marshmallows. The custard underneath was light and lovely.

Price is fair for the quality, about $12 for a crepe. 

Overall, pretty underwhelming. Might be tempted to try again, but nothing that said, 'must return.'"}
{"text":"Excellent French Comfort food. Our table of four shared the charcuterie platter which had very fresh and flavorful prosciutto and duck. I had the poulet with mustard and fried potato and salad greens with vinegarette for entree. I'd recommend reservations since this place is tiny. Attentive but not rushed service. We will be back."}
{"text":"La Kitchenette did a great job transforming this small space to a very cozy eatery. It is one of the few eateries in Madison that has great window-view seat to relax with your coffee and Basque Croque while enjoying Wisconsin's rainy/snowy mood.

The food in general has a hearty portion with flavor that is never too intense nor too mild. The team truly keeps the French cuisine homey and upholds the authenticity Chez Nanou once had. La Kitchenette's staff are also one of the friendliest and most accommodating, which I truly believe is the secret behind their success.

p.s. never forget to try their desserts! The lavender creme brulee is a must."}
{"text":"Cozy, chic and comfortable for brunch; romantic for dinner. What a nice, unique spot. And delicious food. I ordered the green French toast for brunch (I can't remember exactly what it was called). But it sounded like a unique specialty, and I wanted to try something new. Clearly the chef put some thought into this one - I've never tasted anything like it and it was so good! A little savory/sweet. I had to order the sunny side up egg over-hard because I'm pregnant (they were happy to accommodate). I know it would have been even better with the runny egg. YUM. I also tasted my friend's goat cheese and tomato crepes, which were beautiful and so tasty. No air conditioning, so hot afternoons during the summer might not be the best if you struggle with heat. They take reservations on open table - it's such a sweet, little spot, so I recommend reservations if you can. Will be returning for dinner for sure."}
{"text":"It's strange to find super authentic ethnic places in Madison, Wisconsin, but here is a PERFECT example. I went for dinner, which might not be as good as brunch, given the rest of these reviews...but it was still really enjoyable and a good experience!

It is a little pricey for dinner, but SO authentic! Cute little place (good for instagram pictures) with interesting seating. Definitely meant for an intimate lunch/dinner, I don't think it fits any more than 20 people inside. The waitress was super knowledgeable about the menu and the dishes were very unique.

If you're trying to find some authentic French food in Madison, this is DEFINITELY the place to go!"}
{"text":"Yes. You want to eat here.

La Kitchenette - I am absolutely in love with this spot for brunch - little without feeling crowded, a wide-ranging menu that is not overwhelming, but has AMPLE gluten free options. Also fresh orange juice.

The last two times I've eaten here, I've had the crepe with smoked salmon and dill - amazing, and the perfect size for brunch. The coffee is super good too, and the wait staff is quick to offer a refill. The experience is very European, down to being warned about the \"very large\" portion size for an entree that would count as a half order in most other places.

We've never had difficulty grabbing a table for three or four - and I can imagine we'll be back often!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, such a good find! The food is very fresh. With limited space and less seating it is a very intimate restaurant.

Fiancé and I went here for date night. We both got the French onion soup, some of the best we both had. 

I had the chicken special that came with salad and rice. The chicken itself was cooking in a white wine sauce making it very juicy and tender.

Overall it was a great experience!"}
{"text":"Shared a Friday lunch at La Kitchenette with a friend. Its dining room is bright, friendly, and inviting. We lingered for awhile and enjoyed coffee and tea.

The lunch menu is simple; we went with croque monsieur and a salad with lavender creme brûlée for dessert. Next time I want to try the French onion soup.

I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"The place is pretty small, but it has a good ambience with the cushions and the wall decorations. The food is really delicious and of a comfortable portion. I ordered the French onion soup and it has a good amount of cheese in it! For entrée, I had the Basque Croq, which is a sandwich with roasted tomatoes, spinach and Swiss cheese. I added ham and potatoes to it, and that was really delicious! The best was the dessert: lavender crème burlee. So good. Both the custard and caramelized layer were perfect.

Highly recommended for those looking for good a meal with cozy environment."}
{"text":"This is a neat place for a coffee, dessert, or meal. I loved the decor. The walls of this cozy space include a Polaroid wall for guests, a chalkboard wall illustrating France and the food options, plus a large window to watch the snow and people/cars passing by. 

Try ordering off the specials board hanging right over the counter! The waitress was patient with explaining what the options meant and saying them in French for us. The food was fresh and fulfilling, and I have to go back to try all the other options!"}
{"text":"What an adorable dining space with excellent food!  I've had the pleasure of visiting twice-once as a twosome and the second time as a foursome.  Everyone I dined with enjoyed their meals and I was also pleased with my choices each time.  It won't take long for you to review the menu but each item has a touch beyond the basic when one thinks about crepes.  The vibe is casual but modern and welcoming and the service is good and efficient.   Diners need to be prepared to close to one another as well as giving up some personal bubble space as the space is somewhat tight but they make it work.  There is even a fun wall where guests can post a photo or note on the way or or in and gives a larger sense of community that Eastside restaurants are so good at creating.  Great fit for the neighborhood and an affordable place to visit on the regular."}
{"text":"Very high quality brunch. Very savory omelettes, delicious breakfast potatoes in butter and garlic. Small place with a quaint decor and friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"So cute and so delicious! I went in for a light early lunch. I sat by the window. The chalkboard walk is so cute! And their silverware. So chic! I studied abroad in France and this little cafe truly took me back to that summer there. My lovely server even wished me Bon Appetit! :)

I had a cappuccino (delicious), a side salad (that vinaigrette!) and classic French Onion Soup. The soup was amazing! Perfect for a chilly morning. The broiled, browned, chewy cheese on top was perfect. Can't wait to come back and try dinner!"}
{"text":"We enjoy visiting this small and quaint French restaurant for breakfast. The choices are varied, yet simple and rather delicious. I'm looking forward to experiencing the lunch and dinner options."}
{"text":"What a lovely spot. Although I am usually opposed to getting the same thing as someone else, my friend and I couldn't say no to the avocado toast. And for good reason, it was delicious! I have already recommended this place to several friends. Would love to come back."}
{"text":"Cute place , quick and friendly service and delicious food! Went here last Sunday for breakfast. 
Very small so should call for reservation. When we came in , most of the tables were already reserved."}
{"text":"La Kitchenette, je t'aime. I love how you make me feel... like I'm in the French countryside. I love your adorable utensils, rustic interior, friendly servers, and, most importantly, your food.

I came here for brunch one Saturday and ordered the Montagnarde, a Brittany-style savory crepe made of buckwheat (galette) with Brie, prosciutto, and sunny-side egg. My boyfriend got their brioche french toast topped with apple, pecan, whipped cream, and maple syrup. To end, our party ordered the lemon curd crepe for dessert. Everything was tres tres bon! Truly a gem--I highly recommend this spot, and I look forward to many more meals here in the future.

Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"I went to La Kitchenette for brunch after hearing a couple recommendations. I would give it 5 stars if it weren't for the poor service. We were seated and then had other people get seated after us and all of them were served before us. Also our waitress had initially not written down something we ordered, so we had to make sure twice that it was correct. Despite the slow/confusing service though, the food was very good. I loved the French onion soup and the croq' Monsieur I ordered. My boyfriend got a scrambler with spinach, goat cheese, and bacon that was also very tasty.  Would definitely come back for the food, but with the questionable service and also the very crowded space, it might be better to come back during the week instead of a weekend."}
{"text":"Really cute place. Feels authentically French. Had they small cafe feel. Menu was short, but they seem like they do a good job on everything. Would visit again!"}
