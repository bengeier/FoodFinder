{"text":"Ate the Jerk chicken for lunch. Good food at a great price. The beef patty appetizer was awesome."}
{"text":"I tried jerk pasta which was pretty good. It was not over cooked unlike most of the Italian restaurants in America. I think it was a bit pricy for lunch though. Waitress was friendly though I had hard time understanding her accent."}
{"text":"I'm a normal girl with an adventurous palate. I ordered delivery of curried goat, geen beans with bacon, beef patty, saltfish and akee pastry, plantains,  and coconut rum cake. Yes, a lot of food, but a good selection to save for leftovers! The Curry Goat is delicious,  bone in though,  so slows down a very hungry person. The beef patty is good, the saltfish and akee was also good! The real star of the show was the coconut rum cake. To-die-for! Moist and perfect and simple!"}
{"text":"Jerk chicken is super dry and grainy. Rice was great though! Conch fritters were delicious but they skimp the coconut sauce, so ask for extra! To go order was ready 15 minutes past the quoted time. No big deal, one must expect these folks to operate on \"island time\"."}
{"text":"We ordered salads, with dressing on the side. What we received seemed more like wilted, almost steamed and left out lettuce, drenched in dressing. Since it was take out, we assumed some sort of mistake had been made, as the staff seemed distracted, but very friendly when we went pick it up. We were told that was what we had ordered and no attempt was made to rectify the situation. We will not return."}
{"text":"Jerk pasta was spicy and delicious! Love this hidden gem. This is our go to now. Another awesome dish for fettuccine lovers is the Cajun fettuccine."}
{"text":"We arrived at 1:50 pm today and waited until 2:15 p.m. to eat at this recommend Carribean hotspot. Hours on Yelp, their menu and the door states Sunday hours 2:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. No one was there, no lights and no note on the door. We were highly disappointed. We left to eat elsewhere.  I recommend for future you open your establishment on time or leave a note for patrons.  We've had take out from here and it's good. We'll come back, but will call first to make sure your open."}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants caribbean food in Phoenix. The portions are large and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This is a nice clean restaurant, in a low key mall. The food was very good, and the lunch menus was very reasonable. Near the Phx zoo and Botanical gardens, it's a great place for a nice (and spicy) meal. I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Oxtail and the jerk chicken are the best dishes. My wife loves the patties. Feels like home...the only thing missing is the sand.  Tun up!!!"}
{"text":"Restaurateur Rashene and nephew Eli of Caribbean Palm with dishes Braised Ox Tails (Thank you God), Cole Slaw, and Fried Plantains; Ackee Fish with Red Beans and Rice, w/Fried Plantains; and a side of Curry Goat. Yes!!!  This establishment is NOT for those wanting to simply \"taste\"  food. You come here to \"eat\" food - ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT IN FLAVOR, SERVICE AND ENVIRONMENT!   The meats were succulent and tender. The vegetables were crisp, fresh, and seasoned. We fought over the plantains...simply the best. Perfect spot for both casual and romantic dining. Winner hands down on the Island Flair!"}
{"text":"I really hate writing a bad review, but im going to.life is a learning lesson and this is how buisnesses get better, the waitress was very nice, there was nobody in there just  my wife and I, we ordered the appetizer first it was shrimp and soup together with onions in some sort of butter sauce, very bland only 6 shrimp and they were small.terrible appetizer...forgot what it was called??? Then I ordered the chicken parmasian it was better but not much the chicken was overcooked and not fresh, my vegtables tasted like they were out of a can, I will never go back to this place again and I seriously doubt they will be around very long, gordon ramsey would have field day in this place!!!dont go this place sucks!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great. Our first time here and I got the jerk chicken with a side of mashed potatoes and plantains. The chicken was flavorful with just enough spice. I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Every single time the service and the quality of food is exceptional. I love the meat patties, oxtails, rice and peas, the cabbage, and of course the plantains. The curry goat and the conch is as close to authentic Jamaican as you can get in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. I have Caribbean roots and I always find it hard finding great and authentic tasting Caribbean food in Arizona. This place is so delicious. I even took a plate to go.  would definitely come back here"}
{"text":"This place is inconspicuous, and truly the best Carribean food we have ever eaten in the Valley."}
{"text":"We used to live in Jamaica and I LOVE this restaurant!! The Jerk chicken is the real thing /the ackee is wonderful along with the fried plantain/ and Curry goat,etc.!!  that and a Ting or Red Stripe, it doesn't get any better other than unless you're in JA!!!! Thanks"}
{"text":"Such a hidden gem! The food was tasty and fresh! Had the jerk chicken and pork, salt fish strudel, and the fried plantains! Amazing we were the only people dining there."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this amazing Jamaican food! The BEST Jerk Chicken and Jerk Curry we have ever had hands down. Super high quality, moist and delicious, not fatty, complex sauces full of flavor, red beans and rice are moist and tasty and the plantains are perfectly caramelized. Been here three times so far and its become one of our favorite places. This chef is amazing! Very nice ambiance in restaurant as well."}
{"text":"Just tried their Jerked Chicken lunch combo and it was delicious!  The chicken was fresh, well cooked and nicely seasoned with enough heat to make your thirsty, but not so much you couldn't gobble all of the chicken.  The rice and veggies were tasty as well and it was a substantial lunch for a good price.  I'll be coming back to try their dinner and signature dishes (Ackee and Saltfish strudel and Curry Goat)!"}
{"text":"Wow! The jerk chicken is something serious!! It's really, really good. There's a dine in area, as well as, and a carry out area. I ordered from the take out side. I ordered a jerk chicken plate (with rice and peas and cabbage), 1 beef patty, 1 cocoa bread ... total $21.50. Normal price for Caribbean food.  Again the jerk chicken was scrumptious, fresh and hot. The cocoa bread however was stale ... stale as hell actually. I took one bite and said can't do it. I knew it was stale from the way it smelled in the small brown paper back. My grandmother taught me how to smell old bread .. if you know you know   So ... yes to the jerk chicken, hell yes to the beef patty. It came out piping hot and tasted pretty fresh. The bread ... pass on it! There was. One in the restaurant except for myself ?. Service was quick and the food was good ... I'd definitely visit again!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Jamaica, but I have been to much of the Caribbean and hail from NYC, so I do have an appreciation for authentic Caribbean food, and this place has got it!  Spicy dishes are quite spicy (got my nose running) and sweet ones are just that.  The lady taking my order is very nice.  They play a great selection of reggae music.  In a desert of mediocre food, Caribbean Palm is an oasis."}
{"text":"We ordered melt in your mouth braised oxtail and awesome jerk pasta. Took home 12 more beef patties. We love this place. We will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. Love the music. Curried Goat was amazing. Plate portions are good and decently priced. $12 for the curried goat. Extra gravy please!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've had the Shrimp Rundown and it's presented beautifully! Red pea soup is amazing and the Ox Tail is my favorite! Staff is always super sweet and attentive when I come in."}
{"text":"First time eater at this restaurant.  Ordered the Curried Goat for lunch and an Ice Tea.  Iced tea didn't taste quite right, not bad, but not what I was accustomed to.   I enjoy goat and I LOVE curries... the curry sauce had a curry taste was wasn't quite ... you guessed it... right.  I spent a lot of time picking bones/cartilage out...  goat was way more gamey than I am used to. The pile of bones/inedibles looked bigger than what I started with.  Rice and beans and cabbage were the best parts of the meal. Disappointed.  I suspect that this was a good authentic Caribbean curry goat meal, but just not to my own tastes...  oh well."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem.  Was in the area looking for lunch and came across Caribbean Palm on Yelp.  We decided to give it a try.  The menu has a variety of choices, all looked very good and it was hard to decide. We decided  on the Jerk Chicken with the vegetables. Yum, it was GOOD.  I also want to say a word about the service.  The young lady who helped us was so nice.  This was a great experience and I will be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered the oxtails with rice and plantains for takeout. Great portions, flavorful and fulfilling.  Would definitely order here again ! I ordered on uber eats and it was delivered in about 20-30 minutes"}
{"text":"I've never dined in only have had delivery. I love their pasta plates! Every time I have it I love it more and more. My Husband likes the jerk chicken with plantains."}
{"text":"The food is tasty, the atmosphere is gloomy. I will definitely eat it again but would suggest takeout."}
{"text":"Just stumbled upon this place. At lunch here with hubby and two kids under 10. I got curry goat great!! My hubby got chicken .. loved it. Kids got the chicken strips. They were clearly made by hand here.. fresh .. you don't find that in kids menu food often. Staff was nice and very friendly."}
{"text":"The place might not look like much, but give it a chance- the food was really good! Had fried plantains the and the jerk chicken- SO GOOD! Authentic Jamaican food served by super friendly, happy people. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I ordered and after 40 minutes I get a text that they are closed!!! My credit card was charged and nod I'm out of almost $50.00!!! I hope this is settled PROMPTLY!!!"}
{"text":"Great food friendly people and it gives you that island vibe. They have beef patties, Curry chicken, Ackee and salt fish, plantains, and jerk chicken. The rice and peas  oxtail, and curry goat is on point too."}
{"text":"Very authentic Jamaican food. Loved my patty, jerk chicken and Red Stripe. Didn't try the curried goat (in Jamaica or at Caribbean Palm) but it added to the feeling of authenticity. Just wish they had more pink Ting."}
{"text":"First time here and I ordered the Ackee Strudel, and the Conch Fritters for an appetizer, and the jerk fish tacos for the main entree. I've never had Jamaican food before so I was surprised at the flavors used, but that's a good thing!  I'll be back to try out more of the menu for sure.   I also grabbed a Pineapple and Pineapple Ginger soda. Both were really good ! Not much carbonation, but lots of flavor and sugar lol."}
{"text":"If I could give this restaurant less than one star, I would.  I ordered the Cajun Fettuccini, the spinach salad, a *fountain Coke, and some sweet potato pudding.  Immediately, I got a call from the restaurant saying that they were out of sweet potato pudding.  I asked what else they had.  Cheesecake.  That was it.  None of their other desserts.  Hard to believe that, just before a dinner service, a restaurant has no other dessert to serve besides a cheesecakes, especially when the sweet potato pudding is their signature dessert, right?  So, I ate the $.50 difference, and took the cheesecake.  When I ordered the pasta, there was an option to add bleu cheese and bacon for an additional$3.50.  I'd never had Caribbean food before so I figured that might be good and I added it to my pasta.  I got the order fairly fast, however, what I got was ripped off.  The salad was good.  I ate that first.  Then came the Pasta.  No bleu cheese crumbles or bacon, though.  What it came with, was a side of bleu cheese dressing, as in salad dressing.  No bacon.  The next thing I noticed, was the can of Coke.  They charged me $2.75 for a 12-ounce can of Coke.  No fountain drink.  Just a can of Coke.  Okay..  Well, I'll give them the credit for the portion size of the pasta.  It was huge.. And, in general, it was good.  It would have been better had I not poured the bleu cheese dressing on it.  I gave up on eating it after about six or so bites.  Then I moved to the cheesecake.  Absolutely not worth $5.50.  It was room temperature, if not warmer, and mushy.  I'm not sure it was even safe to eat, but I was hungry and couldn't eat my pasta so, I ate it.  When I called the restaurant, they tried to tell me it was \"liquid\" bleu cheese, something I'm unfamiliar with.  I googled it, and all I found was bleu cheese dressing with crumbles in it..  No evidence of a \"liquid\" bleu cheese.  About an hour after I called, I got a phone call from the owner.  He left a message, but I was unable to access my phone to respond because I was at work.  I called the next day, and left a message.  When I returned the owner's call, what I basically got was that I shouldn't be upset that a restaurant that I live 2.7 miles from, charged me a $4.50 delivery fee on top of the %15 tip I already paid to the driver.  He kept reiterating that, because I was a nurse, I shouldn't be upset about paying that amount of money for delivery.  I explained to him that nobody else on grub-hub's site charges that much, and that gas was only a little over two dollars a gallon, meaning that my delivery fee actually bought his driver about two gallons of gas.  He continued to chastise me throughout he conversation, even after I told him I didn't want anything from him, but that I just wasn't going to ever spend almost fifty dollars ordering from his restaurant again.  Seriously.. I paid well over twelve dollars for taxes, tip, and delivery fees.  Never again!  He told me he called back becaus he'd never had a complaint before.  I told him he wasn't being truthful because I'd read the reviews.  So much wrong here.. Just so much wrong."}
{"text":"Me and my wife have ate there several times. We recently moved here from Toronto, Canada, and we have a big Caribbean community back home. Caribbean Palm is hands down the best Caribbean food in the valley, next to grandmas house. I have tried almost everything on their menu. I recommend their Curry Chicken dinner, it is phenomenal. They also have the best beef, and chicken patties. That's enough about the food now let's move on to the service. They are by far the friendliest people I have ever met in the industry, They do have thick Caribbean accents but that's to be expected if you want the real deal. Would defiantly recommend for everyone to stop by at least once and explore something new."}
{"text":"Came here with a bunch of coworkers for lunch and thought it was just okayish. The service for an eleven-person group was pretty slow (we ended up needing an 1 hr + 45 min to order, wait, eat, and get the checks). Other smaller groups came, were served, and left during the time during the time we waiting for our food.  I ordered the jerk chicken w/ fries and was pleasantly surprised by the flavor of the chicken (wasn't too spicy, as I feared it might be), but there was zero salt on my fries. They would have been A+ fries if there had been salt (just skinny enough, crisp but soft and not too greasy)."}
{"text":"I have been here more than a few times. Only bad I can say is that the broccoli she's needs to be more consisting on flavor. Everything else taste great. The jerk chicken is different than I'm use too. Compared to other places but it taste great. Like I said I come here often and will continue. BTW I am a chef."}
{"text":"Had Jerk chicken delivered.  Arrived quickly. Lots of food for the price. The chicken was great,  just spicy enough.  The plantains were good (i prefer them a bit riper and sweeter). The carrot rum cake was the perfect finish. Highly recommend checking them out."}
{"text":"Nice decent Jamaican restaurant. Most convenient of a location. Great tasting food and I am very much appreciative of the staff members. They are very good people with delicious West Indian and Caribbean cuisine. I will recommend all to stop by and try out the roti, oxtail stew, jerk chicken, festivals. Thanks for this good food"}
{"text":"The location is in the old British Open pub. Same layout and bar but they elevated it with nice table settings. I am not Jamaican. I did however live in the CariCom community in Guyana and there are multiple carryovers from Jamaica. I knew it would be exciting when I saw selfish, ackee, and plantains on the menu. Ordering online is super easy and then it's ready when you want for pickup. We ordered the conch fritters. With the delicious curry dipping sauce, the flavor has a nice spring to it. It's a light fritter and comes in 6 pieces, pan fried. Our entree of saltfish and ackee was delightful. The creamy texture of the ackee and the slight chewy and saltiness of the fish is such a great combo. The side of red beans and rice and steamed cabbage took me back to my village in Guyana. But the Rasta Pasta was just so incredibly top notch.  The fettuccini was cooked perfectly and the earthy mushrooms with the tart sundried tomatoes just made this dish so delicious. We took this order to go bit when I arrived to pick up, the lady who brought out the order...maybe she was the owner...was so darn friendly. And the portions are enough for next day lunch and dinner! I really hope we get to try more of this fantastic establishment."}
{"text":"I ordered takeout jerk chicken lunch size. Pretty nice portion. Super spicy and hit the spot!  It came out steaming and fresh. Heads up, they moved locations. Same plaza but south of Dutch bro coffee."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the oxtail meal.  I really wanted to like it, but was quite disappointed.  The peas in the rice and peas were scarce,  the rice lacked seasoning (no salt) and the oxtail was also missing seasoning.  I tasted pepper and garlic but no seasoning salt.  The spinners were miniscule, there was very little gravy over the oxtail; none at all on the rice, and no butter beans!  On a positive note, the meat was tender and the plantains were sweet and tasty.  The cost ($16 including tax) was significantly higher than what I'm used to paying in New York.  After visiting another establishment that sells oxtail for $16 (excluding tax), I've come to the conclusion that this is the average price for oxtail.  The woman who served me was very nice and I may return to try something else off the menu to give them a second chance.  Hopefully I'll have a better experience."}
{"text":"Maybe this isn't 100% accurate as we had this delivered... but this was not the authentic jerk flavor I was hoping for / expecting.  Nothing wow'ed me and I won't be trying them again sadly - the spice level was fine for me but my girl couldn't finish her plate as it was too much for her palate.  Can't recommend this one although I may give them another shot for dine-in in the future."}
{"text":"Thought this place would be good but was sadly disappointed. My plaintains were not fresh and tasted like they had been rewarmed in the microwave. They were dry. The food is over priced! Will not be returning back."}
{"text":"Authentic jammacian!!  The owner and chef and all the staff give true island hospitality. I will be bringing all my friends and family here. Order the Salt fish conch fritters, beef patty, cocobread, Akee......and don't forget your Rum drinks, not to mention dessert"}
{"text":"We were referred to Palm after commiserating with a food truck vendor at a wine festival about the lack of Jamaican restaurants in Phoenix and absolutely none in North Phoenix where we live.  Two weeks later here we are.   The four of us ordered three entrees all of which were well above average.  I'm an east coast person and used to high quality ethnic food which is sometimes hit or miss in Phoenix, not just Caribbean food but ethnic food in general, mostly due to supply and demand I guess.  But on to our meals, we decided on three meals which are part of the 5 or 6 standards in Jamaican food based on my knowledge of Jamaican (Jerk (poultry, pork or fish), brown stew (chicken or fish), Curry (goat or chicken), escovitch fish, Oxtail, salt fish (cod fish and ackee) all usually accompanied by a side of rice and peas, cabbage and carrots or potatoes and fried plantain.  We had:  The Jerk chicken was very good and came with generous portions.  Jerk is best when cooked with bone in and skin on.  Not the healthiest which is why especially in more upscale Jamaican restaurants they have a boneless chicken breast option.  Ours was with bone which came as a quarter chicken (either leg/thigh or wing/breast).  Another key to jerk is that it also needs a little sauce along with the rub that its cooked in which adds flavor for the rice and peas.  This one was the perfect combination.   Next we had escovitch fish.  I always worry about this one.  Escovitch fish is essentially grilled red snapper cooked in a vinegar/citrus marinade along with julienned red and yellow bell peppers and red onions and a whole scotch bonnet to give a little kick.  Ours was excellent except for the heat which the scotch bonnet imparts (about equivalent to a habanero).  That much spice does not appeal to a wide range of people so I understand the lack of spice.  It was excellent and my wife and daughter finished it in its entirety... which rarely happens.   Finally I had the oxtail which is essentially braised oxtail then stewed with Jamaican herbs and seasonings, sometimes with just a slight hint of that ever present pepper flavor.  Mine were very tender coming off the bone very easily as I pulled it off.  The oxtail had great flavor with no hint of hot pepper (scotch bonnet) but with oxtail this is completely okay (not okay with jerk chicken and escovitch fish).  Excellent size portion.   Sides were all very well prepared.  In the past some Jamaican restaurants have left the cabbage fairly leafy which I believe works only when you're boiling the hell out of the cabbage.  Here Palm shaved the cabbage and slightly boiled or steamed the cabbage (notice the color) which is great.  Also they added the standard carrots as well but what I didn't expect was a few well placed Jamaican dumplings. It's a small thing but it was a great addition.  Not too many just a few.   The rice and peas were done great with just the right amount of seasoning, yes rice and peas are seasoned typically with scallion, allspice, coconut milk.  Caribbean Palm is great but menu needs a little trimming.  They have a fusion menu that is not the reason anyone would visit such as the chicken parm, chicken marsala and chicken piccatta.  Just unnecessary in my opinion.   Finally, this place is in a dying strip mall on the border of Tempe and Scottsdale so you likely wouldn't notice it if you're looking for a restaurant the really old fashioned way like stopping at a place that catches your eye.  But if you like good Jamaican, and you're reading a Yelp review you should be running to Palm."}
{"text":"Great flavor and service! Food had an authentic taste, will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I think Caribbean Palm has potential.  The menu has a lot of interesting variety, the kind of stuff I'd like to try over a series of visits.  Food was reasonably priced and quite tasty. I think with a few minor changes they could significantly improve the customer experience.   The area for ordering takeout looked kind of like a convenience store, with some mini fridges stocked with some obscure energy drink.  If they tidied that up a little bit, and added a little background music (maybe some reggae?), it would be a nicer place to hang while you waited for your meal.   I got the sauteed spinach side, which while very delicious, also included a lot of onions and peppers. I don't have any problem with that (I love onions and peppers), but someone that didn't like those extra ingredients wouldn't appreciate the fact that the menu and delivered product didn't coincide.   The jerk chicken, which I'm assuming is a typical flagship dish for a Caribbean restaurant, had a rich, spicy and sweet flavor.  Because it was so good, I was more than a little disappointed with the amount of meat that was on the bones.  When I was done, there were way too many bones left on my plate and my stomach wanted more chicken!     The hostess was friendly, but she didn't do a great job of explaining the menu to a newcomer, so I was a little confused at first.  Regardless of the faults, I would return to try a few other dishes and check out their progress as a new restaurant."}
{"text":"Spring Training in Scottsdale AZ, where do you go when you have three baseball players from The Dominican Republic? Caribbean Palm looked like a good place. Well, I was half right. One glance at the customers told me that, at least, the food was from the right part of the world. The wrong side was the expectation that someone working at the restaurant could speak enough Spanish to communicate the menu to the baseball players. They speak about as much English as I do Spanish. Thank the gods for Google Translate. It took awhile but we worked through the menu and ordered food. We ordered what we know as empanadas, beef and chicken. I liked both but the consensus was that most of us liked the beef over the chicken. That left me to enjoy a couple of chicken empanadas. Fried plantains were liked by everyone. The menu is filled with food that you do not find in many places around Scottsdale, like Jerk Goat and Ox Tail. This was a great opportunity to try something new. I ordered Curry Chicken. This is much different from Thai Curry Chicken. First impression was that this is a lot of food. Much more than I could eat after all the appetizers. Second impression, wow this is good food. I am not even going to try to explain it here. This is food that must be experienced and enjoyed. Go, eat, and enjoy the favors of the Caribbean. By the way, the baseball plays carried bags of food back to their hotel."}
{"text":"The jerk chicken and red beans and rice is to die for. I've come back to this place many times. The coconut rum cake is to die for me. Definitely worth the pricey menu."}
{"text":"Terrible first experience!   I drive all the way there only to find this place closed despite yelp, google and the sign saying it's open WTF!?"}
{"text":"Delicious food, the portions were huge. The customer service was great also. It was quiet could have used a little soft Jamaican music. They didn't turn it on until the end."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch.  They have a sign out showing jerk wings lunch special.  We were given a dinner menu, which is probably the only menu they have.  The waitress didn't mention the lunch special, but I wanted to try something else anyways.  I got the ox tail which was good.  Not the greatest or the worst.  Would I get it again?  Probably not.  Not enough flavor especially for the price and portion.  My friend Alf got the jerk chicken which was also lacking much of that strong flavor thats expected of jerk.  The sided all sound good but are very basic when brought out.  Only great thing was the fresh cooked plantains which were delicious and crispy."}
{"text":"Went there with a group of 8 people and we ordered take out! The person who took our order was really nice....The wait time for our order was about 30 minutes. I ordered the Curry Goat. It was good but, it was kinda dry. They didn't put enough stew. If you like a lot of stew you'll have to ask for it when placing your order!   The restaurant is in a plaza so there is plenty of parking!  Overall great experience! Would for sure come back!"}
{"text":"I'll do the same as the guy below and say I don't want to be mean because they're new and I hope they get a little better. I love Caribbean food, and Jamaican in particular is something there's very little of in Phoenix. I had the jerk chicken as well and it was very much on the jerk and very small on the chicken...it seemed well priced but there were too many bones and too few pieces (which may have compensated for the lack of meat on the pieces that were there.) my wife loves plantains, as do I, bit we both thought something was off...maybe just not ripe enough. I'll review again after I try again...which I'll try to do because  it is family owned and the menu did have a lot of depth."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed! This restaurant is one of my favorites in Arizona. Best Jamaican food I've had here!"}
{"text":"Authentic Caribbean food! Wait isn't long, food fresh and delicious and the main hostess is great with customer service. My husband and I have dined here twice and will continue to come back! I had the jerk chicken pasta, my husband had the jerk chicken, and for his birthday pineapple rum cake. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delicious. I ordered the veggie patty,  fried plantains, and jerk pasta. Everything came out super fresh and amazingly seasoned. Going in I expected everything to be sweet with a tiny bit of spice as most Jamaican places I went to are, but this place is much more than that.  The wait time for the food is a little extensive. I waited about 20-30 minutes, but it was absolutely worth it. I couldn't even identify all the spices in my pasta. They used coconut milk as the base for the sauce and it was delicious. Carribean palm is to carribean food as curry corner is to Indian food. Do not be fooled by the outside. It's a must try."}
{"text":"I went there in hopes of a salad and was told they couldn't make a salad today because the salad lady wasn't there..had a quesadilla instead."}
{"text":"I was excited when I saw the menu for this Caribbean restaurant. I hadn't had conch since I was in the Bahamas years and years ago. I also loved that there was ackee and saltfish on the menu as well.   I had the ackee and saltfish strudel and had the curry conch as a main dish. The strudel top layer was crispy, but the successive layers were gummy tasting. The saltfish and ackee itself tasted good though. The ackee had the typical creamy, egg-like taste juxtaposed against the concentrated flavor of the cod. As for the main dish, I liked the tropical flavor of the curry and it was a generous portion of curry, cabbage, and red beans with rice. However, the conch was overcooked and had a very rubbery tough texture.   Other dishes I tried were a lot better, such as the jerk chicken and meat patty.   Service was good and drinks were refilled as needed. They have an interesting selection of Caribbean sodas including Ting, which is similar to the taste of Squirt.  I didn't really enjoy my appetizer and main dish too much, but service was good, dishes other people ordered were better and the other options on the menu looked tempting so I'll give them another try. Overall 3.5/5."}
{"text":"I have ordered from them multiple times because I enjoyed the food when it is prepared/delivered properly, the problem is I have had multiple times in which the delivery process was poor.  They have forgotten certain items and still charged me in full, the other day that situation occurred once again.  Again I like the food so I have looked passed it before, but when the food took an hour and 1/2 to get here, food was cold and items were forgotten, I felt like I had to speak up."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. We stopped here on our way to visit the botanical gardens. They had Carribean jerk chicken advertised as a special, which is what drew us in. As soon as we walked in, it seemed incredibly strange. At 12:30p, we were the only customers. The host, seemed surprised that we want to be seated. There are only about 15 tables in the restaurant and it seems very nice with white table clothes and cloth napkins, but then there are crepe paper streamers hanging over the side door. Back in the corner, there are odds and ends just gathered. Off to the side and out of the way, but still in plain view. After watching Breaking Bad, this struck me as some sort of money laundering operation. The server didn't seem to know how to act, almost as if she had never served customers before.  She didn't mention the special and we had to ask. I asked if there we onions in the dish I ordered. She said no, but when she served my order it was covered in onions.  The portions were tiny. The overall vibe and atmosphere was uncomfortable. They had no background music, complete silence. I would not recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"OMG.  This is NOT a fast food restaurant. It's also not a place where the aromas won't tempt you to try any number of things you might never have had before.  Orders are made to order.  Be prepared to wait, but it'll be worth it! We had the app called Shrimp Rundown, made of delectable shrimp in a luscious, herbed coconut and vegetable sauce.  I had the goat curry (yum!) and husband had a vegetarian pasta dish with coconut sauce that he couldn't possibly finish, despite my continuing to dig in.   Highly recommended.  The address is 1443 n scottsdale road, which is close to the McDowell address shown on Yelp, but not quite.   Try it.  You'll like it.  Promise."}
{"text":"Do you know what \"Festivals\" is & ain't Jamaican?! The lunch special being advertised outside caught my attention so I stopped by. I asked the no personality lady in the bar area what was Festival & she said, \"just festivals like a brand\". I said whatever, Ill try it. Festivals is a form of bread! I didn't know that!! She told me they only been at this location for 4 months & her personality could careless to have more customers than myself come back because she lacked personality & anytime someone asks about a menu item you would think you would want to explain!. The jerk was OK but I have def have had better & the festivals were good too but everyone know some customer service won't bring customers back & I aint going back."}
{"text":"I ordered food from here and it was mediocre at best. Service was also mediocre. I love Caribbean cuisine but this missed the mark."}
{"text":"The order delivered one hour and 15 minutes after the order placement.. The food delivered was cold and missing some items requested.!"}
{"text":"I Tried a local Caribbean Restaurant located at Papago Plaza South West Corner of Scottsdale and McDowell Rd. They took over the old British Pub. There is plenty of seating. I was by myself so I sat at the bar. I wish that I wasn't driving. I would have had a cocktail! Broad menu Caribbean, curry, pasta, salads, appetizers, kids, lunch and dessert. (Exotic Choices Ox, Fish etc) I ordered Jerk Chicken served with rice and cabbage. I also ordered a side of my favorites plantain. Everything was delicious. Jerk chicken had a couple random tiny bones. Just be careful when chewing. Jerk is little spicy if you have no problem with spice it's great!!    I thought it was good and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow - maybe try this place in person but do not get their delivery.  45 minutes late from their confirmed delivery of an hour, I called.   The lady was Very rude.  I wasn't hostile - I just asked if the driver might have gotten lost.    The food was ice cold.  When I called back to explain, I was treated terribly."}
{"text":"Ok... My wife is 100% Jamaican born. She is picky about food, but VERY picky about Jamaican food. Well...she LOVED the Curry Goat. Best Jamaican food we have tried in AZ and yes we tried a bunch. One thing, the cooks are Jamaican so go figure that helps. If you want to taste REAL JAMAICAN FOOD, for real,  trust me you, have to eat something here.    One thing, we discussed Joe if Americans go to Jamaica and only eat resort food.. They would NEVER get the chance to taste authentic Jamaican cuisine. This is the real deal Jamaican."}
{"text":"Drove by recognized the Caribbean restaurant  after entering and not being greeted. I had to asked for a menu and quietly mention is Roti on it, she abruptly told me this was a Jamaican restaurant . A menu was handed To me, I ordered jerk chicken as I was waiting for my dish to come out and enjoy a spicy Jamaican dish I was handed a Styrofoam box in a bag and offered a plastic fork to go ,it was absolutely the worst experience I've ever had at any Caribbean restaurant that only serves Jamaican food . now let's start with the dish that I had to eat at home two pieces of chicken with spice jerk seasoning and a half  box \"RICE\" I will finish with this if your restaurant says Caribbean don't only provide Jamaican food ... And last but not least why is everything with french fries I mean french fries lol what a joke ..."}
{"text":"My husband and I were pleasantly surprised by our lunch this afternoon! We had cut through the papago plaza and the lunch special sign caught our eye, so we gave it a shot. There was a cooking class in the main dining area when we arrived, so the place smelled great! We ordered the fritters for a starter which were delicious with the curry sauce. We decided to share the jerk chicken and curry chicken. The jerk chicken was very flavorful and spicy. Chicken curry was equally delicious and flavorful with the veggies. Both plates came with a sizeable portion of rice and beans. I literally left nothing on my plate and can't wait to try more items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the authentic Caribbean food this place cooks up in the middle of the desert! The spices and amazing sauces they use are to die for. I also LOVE that I can get such great quality food DELIVERED to my house!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really good, better than some I had in the valley. Ordered jerk chicken, cabbage and plantains, very fresh and authentic. Chicken is mildly spicy and soft. I would order here again."}
