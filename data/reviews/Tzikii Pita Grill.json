{"text":"Compared to Hummus Express this place is a joke.  You get twice the amount of food with a much greater selection at Hummus Express. If you are on a diet eat here.  If you are hungry go to Hummus Express."}
{"text":"This place treats their employees like crap. They pay under the table and don't even pay minimun wage, even though their employees work 10-16 hour shifts. They don't even get their meals for free or at any kind of a discount. And they wonder why they have such a high turnover."}
{"text":"Excellent experience!  Delicious marinated chicken and fresh ingredients in the chicken bowl. Prices are very reasonable for fresh high-quality food. Service was prompt and friendly. We will definitely be back!  Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Small and unassuming in a fairly empty lot, Tziiki is a local spot with great gyros, shwarma, and falafel. Cheap, fast and friendly service make this a Perfect lunch spot, especially when you are sick of sandwiches and burgers."}
{"text":"First time here and when I am back in the area I will be sure to visit again for the Cilantro Jalapeño Hummus!! Oh my goodness it is soooo delicious!
I ordered with falafel plate with salad and 2 dipping sauces, one of which I already named, and did I mention it was freaking fantastic? It is! I also got the regular baba ganoush, they didn't have the spicy today :( so only 4 stars.  The regular was still good and had a hint of a smoky flavor. 
The rest of the plate consisted of 3 falafel patties sitting on a fresh chopped garden salad. They were average sized, crispy and flavorful. The salad was a little heavy on the red onions but I prolly should've request easy onions. Still very fresh  and tasty. 
The service was great and prompt. Thumbs up and I'll see you all again soon!!"}
{"text":"Had a chance to try Tziki Pita Grill. Ordered the Chicken Shawarma pita and it was good until I bit into a BONE!!!! I showed the manager and all he did was say sorry. Didn't offer something else or even check to see if I was ok! I threw the rest of my lunch out and will never be back. Not Cool!"}
{"text":"Nice little place. I had the Koshari (had to) I grew up on that stuff in Egypt. I have to say it's very close. It lacks lentil. I suggest ordering the onions and sauce on the side.

Very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Holy delicious Gyros and Schwarma!!!!  And the nicest people in the world working there.  Don't miss this hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"They have a vegan menu !!!
Everything is made in house...
Ordered the original hummus, cilantro and jalapeno hummus...even though they say the cilantro hummus was more popular, I still like the original!  We had the spicy baba ganoush and the original ~ both were YUMMY ! Also ordered the falafel plate....very good. Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. We also ordered the bowl, it looks very simple ( noodles, rice, garbanzo beans, carmalized onions and sauce ) but the flavors were VERY delicious! ! Met the owner and he was super nice....definitely will return again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for this place, because I like to try new places. There food is excellent and the guys who own this place are as nice as can be. This is one place I would definitely go back to again and again."}
{"text":"Just found this awesome place today.  The vegan Koshari bowl was delicious!   Can't wait to go back.  I did take-out but really liked the authentic vibe."}
{"text":"Excellent authentic Greek food- not a chain! Welcoming customer service.  Beef Schwarma (sp?) and Gyro combos.  Really good dips (so good we took more takeout for home).   We had homemade \"Cucumber Lemonade\".  Great choice!!  They are in small shopping strip mall near Terri's Consignment."}
{"text":"Got the gyro and beef pitas and they were delish,  but I really can't stand that their system automatically asks for a tip when you use a card to pay!  And the tip starts at 18%! I felt too guilty to tap \"no tip\"  so there went my dessert.  If you have my problem,  pay in cash.  I doubt they will ask you for a tip then... Or will they?"}
{"text":"This place has decent food but messes up the orders too often. We go there quite a bit (getting used to the messed up orders) and a lot of the time they're out of certain sodas. When you pay $2 for a drink I hope they have a supply of it. Anyways it's not too bad of a place but can use some fixing up."}
{"text":"Among the best cooked gyro meat I've ever had. Also accommodated gluten free request by providing veggie sticks instead of pita bread served with hummus."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for years. From the awesome customer service to the delicious foods they make, it is simply the best. I have tried almost everything on their menu and it never fails on how fresh the food always is. I've told all my friends, coworkers, and family about this place and they love it as well. Would definitely not stop coming here!"}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma salad was huge and tasted great. The scoop of hummus dip was an add on."}
{"text":"Good food. Had the bowl so I could use the coupon. Would come back to try the pita! Get the yellow rice, it's healthier and super good. :)"}
{"text":"Tried the food there recently and was pleasantly surprised at the quality!  Everything tasted delicious, the portions were good, the staff was friendly and the prices fair.  If you're in the neighborhood there, stop by and give them a try yourselves :)."}
{"text":"For the first time in 2 years I ended up with major food poisening. The hummus tasted old and Also when we entered the staff didn't seem welcoming at all, Not one smile from anyone."}
{"text":"We hat the Tempe Chamber ribbon cutting last night and Mo and his team were right on point, being a Greek Egyptian fusion place the flavors were wonderful.  Mo let me try the \"Koshari\" was fantastic for a vegan dish and I cant wait to get a full order.  The Chicken Schwarma I hear was the bomb.  with 26 people attending we all come out with smiles. To wash it all down with a big cup of Cucumber Lemonade pushed this meal over the top.

My office is 1 block from this place it has now become one of my hangouts.

If you need a group setting they own Nara Hookah Lounge right next door, very clean and great Turkish coffee."}
{"text":"What a delightful find!  Stopped by for a quick bite; had the falafel pita which was very good, made to order and fresh. I was given a sample of their spicy dip and chips; quite tasty. And the best baklava (with nutella) that I ever had in my life...this sweet melt in your mouth experience was wonderful. Worth going back to !!"}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma was very flavorful and they have a variety of hummus flavors!! The cilantro jalapeño hummus is tasty! :)"}
{"text":"This place is excellent.. The food is fantastic, fresh made and you can tell they take pride in their food.  All I can say is this is a do-over for us!!! My kids are super picky when it come to stuff being made fresh. Didn't have to worry about that here!!"}
{"text":"Not really impressed. Got the chicken shawarma plate and it tasted really salty and dry.  It's all precooked and sitting in front of you at the counter like a cafeteria. 

For the price (over ten dollars for a plate) you can get better tasting Mediterranean that is cooked to order. Try MedFresh Grill on mill ave north of university and you'll see what I mean.

Maybe the gyros are better? There are a lot of 5 star reviews, not sure what I'm missing here."}
{"text":"From the Mediterranean Sea to the Deserts of Arizona, Tzikii Pita Grill is definitely the best place to eat!!!  I drive from North Scottsdale, and it is WORTH the extra 35 minute drive for food this GREAT!!! The menu has great choices, has its own unique flavor that no other Mediterranean/ Greek restaurant can measure up to in Phoenix. One of my favorite is the chicken salad topped with TZIKII sauce A-mazing!!!  The owner Mino runs this place, he has amazing culinary skills and his dishes prove it!!!
And if you want to smoke hookah visit right next door Nara Lounge, Mino owns that as well!! :)

ENJOY!!!"}
{"text":"I work close by so a coworker and I tried the place today. I had the reg gyro sandwhich and she had the gyro salad. 

My gyro was basically lettuce only. There was hardly any meat. Plus, the gyro was greasy, which made the pita soggy.. I have never had a greasy gyro before today so I was surprised...

My friend told me that her salad barely had any meat, as well. Her salad was $9 and was basically lettuce...

We both agree that we will not be going back"}
{"text":"Their food taste like shit!! My gyro pita had hair in it!! And the noodles were overlooked in the meal. And the gyro was dry.. I was highly unsatisfied and their slow service was annoying. I DO NOT recommend this place!! Unless u lyk eating overlooked, hair infested.. And not to mention their salad was gross looking! It obviously wasn't fresh"}
{"text":"We had falafel, hummus and koshari. 

The falafel and hummus were solid, fresh and tasty. 

The koshari was interesting, but the onions on top were cooked beyond caramelization and were burned, giving it a bitter, burnt taste. However, I will try the koshari again as it has a lot of promise.
I will update next time I try it."}
{"text":"I was looking for a Greek place that were actually serving rice and came across this hidden gem! 

I've been here a few times and never been disappointed, the plate with salad and rice is a great amount of food with a fountain drink and a pita. If I could eat here everyday I would!"}
{"text":"Wow!  The first time i came to find out about this place was through my sibling.  She one day came to the office, opened a take away box and the aroma of the food she had, made the whole office say\" That smells amazing delicious,  what is that!? \".lol.    That's when she had mentioned Tzikiis. A place located on priest,  just a little off the 1-10. It's a small place but the good food is what makes it BIG.
This definitely a go to place for Mediterranean gyros and salads."}
{"text":"I had a gyro and my husband the gyro salad. Food was very tasty. After finishing I went to wash my hands and was definitely turned off by the filthy sink and mirror. Do not know when cleaned last. Came out of the bathroom and looked around noticing how grimy the place was. This was on a non busy Sunday afternoon. The 2 workers had plenty of time to do some cleaning. It's really too bad because we thought the food was good."}
{"text":"My kiddos are kinda picky and one had already eaten, so one had a frozen yogurt and the other one a pizza slice to eat while we were HOPING to enjoy some delish Greek food (have visited here before with my son having a pizza slice to eat along with us). As soon as we walked in, the lady almost shouted to us that no outside food was allowed. This was NOT stated on the window, and, like stated, we had done it before. Please post on window, and make sure all employees are following the same policy."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma pita was pretty good but it was definitely overpriced as I had a 25% off for a first-time customer from Yelp and my total was still a dollar more than what I consider to be slightly better Mediterranean food and that is Princess Market on Broadway.

I encourage the owners here to look online at the menu for princess Market and readjust your menu prices when compared to comprable restaurants in the area.

Tzikii price $6.49
Princess Market price $4.50"}
{"text":"This place is yummy. I get the vegan Falafel and it's so delicious. It's great because it's not all greasy like some Falafel can be. Also, it's not dripping with sauce that I have to scrape off which is nice."}
{"text":"I think the 4 stars are a bit deceiving.  I also think those that believe this is the best Mediterranean food or the best Gyro in AZ simply don't know any better. This wasn't the worse Mediterranean food I've had in AZ but most certainly not the best.  I found this place compliments of Yelp of course :)  It's a short 7 minute drive from my job so I decided to try it.

I ordered the original gyro.  The price on the menu was $7.49 but with using my 25% check it offer, the price was only $6.08 - SCORE!  Immediately I noticed I didn't see the gyro meat roasting (if that's what it does) out in the open on that rolling thingy I'm used to seeing in Gyro shops.  When I placed my ordered, he heated my pita then scooped the meat out of the heating container/tray.  I watched him drain the grease before he placed the meat on my pita.  I wondered, why is there anything to drain.  I quickly found out once I picked the bag up out of my passenger seat.  Grease - right there in the seat.  The grease leaked through the bag.  I've never had a greasy gyro before ... that was a turn off for me.  The gyro itself taste good, the meat was nicely seasoned but I would not order it again because of the grease. 

I told the guy this was my first time coming here. He suggested I take a few menus with me for next time.  The menu features a buy one get one half off on chicken bowls.  I'll probably take advantage of that offer if a co-worker want to order something and only if I can get my meal half off.  Besides that, I wouldn't return."}
{"text":"What Beef Sharma is supposed to taste like. Yum! Been twice this week and so happy I discovered it. Simple place but good. Kinda wish there were more options like hummus w sharma or something but I'll be back again and again"}
{"text":"*drool* The vegan koshari bowl is delicious! Crispy onions, perfectly flavored garbanzo beans, lentils, rice and macaroni. Really appreciate that they have a vegan menu right up on the wall. Keeping my fingers crossed that eventually they'll do vegan baklava some day. Perfect lunch spot. Very nice people who work there and fast service."}
{"text":"I was from out of town in the area looking for somewhere to eat lunch, and all I saw were chain restaurants everywhere. Luckily I stumbled upon this restaurant and was so glad I did. The food was really good and the folks behind the counter were super nice. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This section of Tempe has received a glut of Greek restaurants in the past year. Within a 2 mile radius there's  Niro's, Mika's, Café Greco and one other I can't remember the name of. This place is clean and the staff is friendly but all of their food is already precooked and waiting for you in hotel pans. Which is great if you're on the go, but if you like the taste of gyro cut right off of the spit as you wait then this isn't your place. I'll go back and try and try some of items before I make any final decisions.  This place is a little hard to find so look next to the T-Mobile behind the gas station."}
{"text":"Wow, really impressed! Decided to go after reading all of the positive reviews. The chicken shawarma was amazing topped off with the babaganoosh dip. YUM! Convenient, fast, friendly, and high quality."}
{"text":"Great place. Lot's of variety  Excellent food!!!"}
{"text":"I've gotten both the gyro pita and bowl and they are both delicious. Meat tastes fresh and tzikii sauce is great. I would recommend take out, as restaurant is a bit hot inside with the weather and obviously all that cooking. Take note that you should specify that you want the $6.99 pita or bowl special, as the one on the regular menu is different price."}
{"text":"Have to say I was not impressed at all.. Had a gyro and it was lukewarm at best. Not enough tziki sauce on it and only like 2 small strands of onion. I love a good gyro, and this is not the place to go for one. I also didn't find it to be very clean either."}
{"text":"Is this place even open anymore?   Website link here and in the LocalFlavor website comes back with a 404 error.   Has been for at least the 2 days I've been trying to look at it.  Not going to buy the LocalFlavor coupon deal until I can be sure it's not closed."}
{"text":"Yet another highly rated review of a Greek/Mediterranean restaurant establishment I am composing, and I'm fearful of the loss of credibility this may ignite. 

HOWEVER, the stars bestowed here are not in vain or exaggerated. I hope a few specific examples may help me show this. 

Do you like seeing your food made in front of you? I most surely do, and you can expect that here. :)

Do you want your food fresh and made to order? What? A rhetorical question you say with an obvious response? Yes-guilty as charged. Fresh food and quality can be expected too, so let me just come right out and say it. 

Now, going back to something I touched on earlier -because I'm ADD and love to jump around paragraphs at random-I must address something about this type of restaurant. It is true that I have  really been enjoying a lot of gyros and pitas lately, but HOOOOLD UP! STOP! Take a walk outside this place, turn around, and look to your right. Is that a hookah lounge?!!

YES. :) So what makes this place even better, is that there is a hookah lounge (same owners) next door that is a supplemental concept to the great food at the restaurant, and you can eat the food here and more! More as in enjoying the plush seats and relaxing atmosphere after a stressful week, and the comfort of the other neighborly, friendly patrons. 

I'm really not doing this place justice. You just have to go. It's very unique, and I drive all over Arizona for work daily, and this is like nothing I've seen out in our beautiful state. Support a great local business please, and give this place a shot. 

Did I mention a lot of the food selections are healthy? Yep. These folks know what they are done are doing :)"}
{"text":"Decent lunch spot. The prices seem a bit high but the food tastes good. I usually get a gyro in either size or the gyro salad. The one big thing I've noticed lately is that the place isn't super clean which is always a turn off for me ... I don't like dirty fingerprints everywhere or sticky tables. The staff is friendly and haven't made any mistakes on my orders."}
{"text":"Try the chicken shwerma bowl! It's absolutely delicious. I had a salad with it which was great perfect portion size. The cucumber lemonade was freshly made and so good- a drink unique to tzikii. If you're hungry for a Greek meal I highly recommend this spot. Don't forget to have done baklava for dessert!!"}
{"text":"Decent meal at a decent price.  Not sure it was the best Mediterranean food, but it wasn't bad"}
{"text":"Projectile vomit! Ate here tonight, had the lamb and everyone is sick. What else is there to say besides Food Poisoning deluxe."}
{"text":"The food was so good and fresh! You can see the cooks chopping up the fresh meat in the kitchen. They wait to cook your food -- not just prepare/assemble, actually cook it -- until you order it. This may seem normal to people who have not worked in the restaurant industry. However, many restaurants, including the ones with price points in the $20 - $30 a plate range, have a lot of their foods premade in a warehouse, and all they have to do is open a bag and heat. So this is rather exceptional in my opinion, since the price point is about $12 a person for a tasty, filling meal with sides and a drink.

As we watched the fire flash in the frying pan, I sipped on my cucumber lemonade. Perfect for a warm day. Very refreshing and light. As the cook piled my boyfriend's beef schwarma into the gyro bread, we saw the hot, crispy fries arise. Normally, I don't like beef very well (too greasy and heavy); but this was *delicious*. It reminded be of a tangy barbecue, but without the heavy taste. It mingled just right with the fresh cucumbers, lettuce, and tzatziki. I ordered the chicken schwarma bowl which has rice, chicken, all of those veggies, and fries or pita chips. It was yummy, as well.

By the way, the dining room is small. I think it had about six tables which would seat two people, one which would seat about three, and a couple of tables outside. So plan accordingly (and maybe call ahead?) for large families or groups wishing to dine in.

We went here for lunch with an Entertainment coupon. I like that we received 100% of the service and portions. (Some places sigh a bit when you use coupons. They were happy to have us.) We will definitely return, even though it's a few miles from home."}
{"text":"Didn't like the place at all. 
The food wasn't fresh. The person taking the order mixed up my simple order of one Chicken Shawarma plate and one falafel plate. 
Price not worth the taste. There are many better places around."}
{"text":"Sub par chicken shawarma. Food didn't taste fresh and the chicken was bad. koshari was good. Overall, this place is a 3/5"}
{"text":"Hair on gyro meat. Enough said. Lost my appetite, but I wanted a bowl thinking it came with veggies and all of the fixins but it was just rice and meat I would rather have gone to Chipotle ...never again"}
{"text":"Great Gyros! 1st time here and food was delicious and plentiful. Fries were even good :-)  Will return for sure"}
{"text":"Great spot for hummus and pita chips and much more! They make everything fresh and the choices are really good. Love it when the have the cilantro hummus,  yum!"}
{"text":"Tried to eat dinner here on a Sunday night.  All Yelp info and store signs read normal Sunday hour open until 7pm.  Was very disappointed to find the restaurant closed at 6:10pm."}
{"text":"Not a fan, I was thinking of just going over to Pita Jungle for a salad but saw this place on my yelp. Decided to try it out. Right after I seen him making the salad I knew that I probably was not going to be a big fan. Their chicken was so salty, didn't enjoy the flavor, and the salad did not even include much of the greens, total joke for almost a $10 salad. Do yourself the favor and avoid this place and all the salt."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a quick lunch with my husband.  He had previously purchased a coupon for Tzikii Pita Grill and we decided to use it.  He ordered the gyro pita and I ordered the beef shawarma bowl with rice.  I was impressed with how good it was."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma pita at Tzikii grill is one of the best I have had. The pita was packed full of savory chicken with just the right amount of added fillings and delicious tzikii sauce. 

We also got a side order of hummus which was very tasty and a good thick consistency. 

To top it off the staff was exceedingly friendly.  All of this added up to quite an unexpected lunch experience."}
{"text":"The staff was extremely negative, it wasn't a place I would stay and eat. I ordered my food (to go), and it tasted okay, but the hummus was Not okay, it left a bad taste, and smelt a little funky. Sadly i threw it away as soon as I got home  I think it was old."}
{"text":"I just had a pita here and am not going to lie it was very good. I would recommend this place. On the down side the place needs a lot of love. It is beat up and needs a good thorough cleaning top to bottom"}
{"text":"pls dont go ! chicken is undercook and smelling weird . a very bland food without no taste."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. I come here for lunch multiple times a week. The shawarmas are great whether you get the beef or the chicken or even the vegan option. The dolmas are an excellent healthy option and the tzikii sauce that comes with it is very flavorful."}
{"text":"Not a huge Greek food fan, but I went here with a coworker and had the chicken plate it was so good. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Stopped by to try them out and glad I did. I got the Greek plate and salad. Both made to order fresh and so delicious! Give them a try!"}
{"text":"OMG Great food. Loved the Koshari  Vegan dish very Authentic  as well as the Gyro salad. The location is very convenient, and easy to find."}
{"text":"This place was \"fair, at best\". On a 10 point scale, I'd give it a 5.  Why? Read on....

Atmosphere = 5 out of 10 - cold, hard, not warm, no abmience, old stereo in corner with wires everywhere, things stapled to walls, felt dirty. Not great.

Food quality/taste = 6 out of 10 - this was not great Mediterranean food, had some strange textures and bland sauces. All food served on paper/plastic/Styrofoam throw away plates

Food portion size = 6 out of 10 - not great, fair at best, kind of small, particularly for the price

Service = 7 of 10, people were okay, seemed like a \"job\", the apparent manager (?) seemed nicest

Price/value = 6 out of 10. Really not great. The taste was not great, the portions were not great, the atmosphere was not great, and the price was at least $8-$11 per person for bland/poor food served on throw away paper-goods. 

-- Would I go back? No, I honestly would not go back. This was altogether not a good combination. Terrible? No. Good? No.

I'd try any other place close by. I've had much, much better Mediterranean food. 3 places come to mind that are not far away and are stellar. I believe I've reviewed each of them before; Pita Bistro, Haji-Baba and Byblos. The first 2 are the same price as this Tzikii Pita Grill, or less, and much, much better in every way. The last, Byblos, is more of a sit down, traditional old school recipes, run by the grandparents and sooo good!"}
{"text":"Delicious food here. My favorite thing to order is vegan falafel with spicy baba ganoush! It is so nice that they have a vegan menu. I am comfortable ordering without worrying about my meal being fully vegan. The owners are very friendly and make sure you have a good experience at their restaurant. I have even brought a few friends in to try it out and they all loved it! -Kelly"}
{"text":"The pics that they have on here make everything look so good but it's not. I got the vegan kosher bowl and it was mostly rice with probably one very small scoop of lentils and a half cup of macaroni noodles which looked like they had been over cooked. The taste was decent, but would never go back here ever again! I paid $8 for my bowl, which made me more upset about the food. (Forgot to take pic bc I was hungry, as I chose this place for lunch, during my lunch time. So yes, I ate some of it) but would not recommend this place to ANYONE! EVER!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant!!! The food is fantastic and so yummy!!!  I'm recommend this place to everyone and anyone"}
{"text":"The food here was fantastic.... not expensive and totally full of flavor.

Cost:  Really inexpensive.  Lunch for two was $16.

Food:  Some of the best Mediterranean I've had.  Only Princess is better from what I've had.  Extremely flavorful... especially the spicy babaganoush sauce.

Service:  People that worked there were nice enough and checked to make sure the food was acceptable for us, which is pretty unusual for a fast-food style restaurant.

Ambiance: a bit on the plain/utilitarian side...  about what you'd expect for a non-chain fast-food type of establishment.

Overall:  A bit of a drive for me but I'll be back for sure.  The atmosphere is lacking, but as expected for the type of restaurant that it is."}
{"text":"this is not real Mediterranean food not even close I'm not sure what other people have had before but this is nowhere near authentic Mediterranean food. The vegetables were old and wilted and bland and just over priced.... terrible! continuing the trend that Phoenicians have no idea real food is."}
{"text":"It is not often I get to try something new. Veg options across the board are a bit more limited, but the Koshari bowl was a great new experience. On paper it may sound confusing, rice,lentils,pasta?, garbanzo beans and tomato sauce topped with onions. But they real keys are tomato sauce which is full of flavor in both mild and spicy form and the fried onions. What don't friend onions make wonderful? And for 5.99 it is a good deal, but I was a bit hungry after so next time I will try the plate which I assume incluides a dip and pita."}
{"text":"Ok so I have a very good handle on mediterranean food and to keep this short and sweet this food is only good when your so hungry and there is not a place to eat open. If your are looking for authentic this place is far off."}
{"text":"I had the gyro and shawarma over rice pilaf, with a Greek salad, tzaziki and hummus, AND a fresh hot pita on the side. Every element of the meal was great. I ate everything on my plate (minus the olives. Devils fruit it is). 

I recommend this place so hard. It's homemade style, not mass produced flavor like some other places in the area. 

The staff is also friendly and accommodating. Say \"Hi\" to Mino, the owner, if he's in!"}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon for this place since it's close by to my office and it's safe to say I won't be back again. Just to be able to use the Groupon I had to sit there by myself (no one in the building besides cook) and they would not give me a to-go lid for my food since I had used a Groupon. ALSO, there were nats flying around in the dining area which is exactly where they keep the food to serve. The food isn't covered at all so it's sitting there collecting dust, germs, nats. I will not be back; nasty."}
{"text":"Went in at noon today, that's when they open nothing was ready yet that's not an issue I didnt mind waiting. The lady working the register seemed to have an attitude, didn't smile once just didn't feel welcome. Ordered beef shawarma and chicken gyro to go, after paying and waiting about 10 minutes the lady informed me there wasn't any meat for the shawarma, i changed to beef gyro. When i got home and we sat down to eat the order was wrong received two beef gyros instead of one chicken, one beef."}
{"text":"I definitely like the two types of rice you get with the Gyro salads! Fun, fast, super friendly. Good Greek food for sure."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and each time I've gotten the Gyro, which is really good... But this time I got the Falafel Pita... YES!  Delicious! Great crunchy exterior, moist inside. Just wonderful!  So far, I've never had anything I didn't love here."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean food for a low price! Most things are over $20 but not here. I ordered chicken pita, greek fries, Baklava, and delicious cucumber drink. Staff were friendly and quick taking about 5-7minutes to cook pita and fries. Pita was delicious (especially with seasoned chicken) Fries were alright but not groundbreaking. Baklava was tasty and Cucumber drink was my favorite thing at Tziki.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I came here before heading to IKEA one day because we were so hungry and this was one of the places that was rated well on Yelp and was close by. I should have read the previous reviews before coming here because several people have mentioned that their food was salty. Well I didn't realize until only after I have ordered my food and sat down waiting, reading the reviews on their food thinking \"oh great, our food is going to be salty!\" 
I ordered the chicken swarma plate with rice, salad, cilantro hummus and pita bread and my fiance ordered the gyro plate with rice, salad, pita chips and some other sauce (forgot the name). Well, I took a bite out of a small piece of chicken by itself and OMG that thing is loaded with salt! I tried a piece of gyro which was not as bad as the chicken but still it's pretty salty if you ask me. I had to make sure I was balancing it out with more hummus and salad when I was eating the salty chicken so it would be more tolerable. Everything else that came with the plate wasn't so bad but it's just the meat that kinda gets at you. Anyways  the first 10 minutes of walking around at IKEA and through the whole night, we were pretty much dehydrated and dying of thirst. I would only recommend this place if you really really really really really enjoy salty foods."}
{"text":"the koshari bowl is my favorite! , the only place in town that makes it the traditional way,"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Greek restaurant when at work in Tempe! Quick service and excellent veggie meal!"}
{"text":"Decent and quick Mediterranean food. Very reasonably priced for the portion size, especially with the 25% Yelp discount. Good gyro salad and hummus, although the chicken shawarma wasn't as good."}
{"text":"The food was decent but not the best. I went in to order something to go. The guy at the register seemed like he didn't know how to put orders in, which was fine. I asked him 3 times about the side of hummus I ordered, with extra pita. He assured me it was on there, it was on the receipt as well. Waited for the food and took it home. What a shocker... I was charged for the large side of hummus and extra pita, and they didn't give us either! Then there were 2 bones in my chicken plate. Seriously disappointed for many reasons. I don't recommend going there and will not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Good solid gyro plate or sandwich.  The chicken Shawerma looked great to.  I just wish the had chicken kebab too."}
{"text":"Nice place for a quick meal. Always get their bowls and the staff is always amazing to us"}
{"text":"No complaints. The chicken schwarma was pretty average. The cashier and chef was a very friendly guy. It's a quaint little spot, and good enough to stop by again for some fast Mediterranean if I happen to be in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Very surprised on the presentation of the food! Very inviting to where it looks great and taste great! The Beef Shawarma was the bomb!!!

Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Ran into this place by coincidence, glad I did the food was nice and fresh the taste was good. I believe the portions should be bigger.Red pepper hummus was delicious, the salad needed more taste more dressing or something. Place is nice and clean, employed were patient and answered all
our questions I will come again"}
{"text":"Best gyro in town I've ever had also my friend took chicken shawera and told me it was amazing. Also the employees are very careful to satisfy the customers"}
{"text":"i love gyros, never ones with crunchy water, but it was  bomb n a little change from you normal gyro spots, fries were good too and the salad was also fresh n tasty, you can use verizon local deals or entertainment or citi deals and score a bogo. its fresh clean food that taste good! i will be back again!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to grab some quick Greek food! I had the gyro pita and it was delicious. They also gave us a sample of the cucumber lemonade which was just as good (we ordered a full glass after we tried it). I'll be back here soon. I've heard good things about their Greek fries so that's next on my list. The owner also owns the hookah bar next door which is the best hookah bar in town, hands down."}
{"text":"Fast food style flavors. Way better choices a few streets north and south of this location."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and really great tasting food. They have some great vegan options too, can't beat it!"}
{"text":"My awesome wife and I decided to try this place. She got the chicken Schwarma salad. I decided to get the Gyro plate.  I'll admit I was a little bit hesitant. I wasn't sure if I wanted to risk a bad meal at a small restaurant I had never heard of. No problems here! Both of us got great food.

The portion sizes were really good. My wife is very picky with the quality of chicken and she loved it. They even gave her a sample to make sure she liked it and they even have diet Dr. Pepper, her favorite. 

The value was excellent. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Small, warm place (by warm I mean that the staff is friendly and I got quite sweaty sitting there--the A/C must have been set on 80). 

Yummy vegan bowl (elbow mac, lentils, rice, some sort of smoky hot marinara sauce, and carmelized onions. DELISH. Generous portions for a reasonable price--much too much food for me for one sitting.

Mr. P. got the chicken shwarma bowl and he said it was also very good. 

We both agree the baba ganoush was TO DIE FOR. And Mr. P. doesn't like eggplant!"}
{"text":"This is normally my go to for fast Greek food.  I was so disappointed when I walked into the restaurant and no one was behind the counter.  I waited for a while after calling out to see if anyone was in the store.  After another customer came in and waited for awhile we both left in search of a restaurant that was staffed."}
{"text":"First time. Got the gyro salad, extra feta, extra tzatziki. Highly recommend.  

Not many seats, but no problem this sat afternoon."}
{"text":"We had an interesting experience... we went here because we had a Groupon and traveled from Mesa. We walked in and were told they didn't have any chicken, which is what we would of ordered. Just as she got done saying that, they dropped the Gyro in the back. We didn't want beef so we ended up getting the Gyro... I'm hoping they cleaned it before they served it. We got our food and our Gyro bowls were delicious however, the hummus was unseasoned and they only gave us one pita for the two of us... our salad was awful, the dressing they used was too sweet and didn't taste like a Greek dressing. Overall, the place gave a weird vibe but if I was able to get a bowl delivered, I might be inclined to order just a bowl."}
{"text":"I love the quick service and the authentic taste. Love the cilantro hummus and chicken shawarma bowl. 
 I wish they give pita chips or pita bread free with hummus. They charge extra for that (don't understand if they expect to eat hummus alone without any pita)."}
{"text":"The shawerma was amazing,  and the cucumber lemonade was so delicious!  I was skeptical about the lemonade but tried it and was sooo glad I did.  New favorite pita spot"}
{"text":"Traditional Mediterranean fare, but with their own special twist! I stopped here after reading some great reviews on Yelp - and was not disappointed! 

Food:
The menu has so many choices! I've been here several times, and everything I've tried has been great. The vegan Koshari was flavorful, although with lots of rice and macaroni it has a lot of carbs. But the taste was amazing! I also enjoyed the Chicken Shawrma Plate and the Greek Salad with Gyro Meat. Many of their selections come with a side of hummus, and I love love the Cilantro Jalapeño Hummus! Last time an employee gave me a sample of the Spicy Babaganoush and it was outstanding, too. I'll be getting that next time.

Cost:
Very reasonable, especially considering the portion sizes.

Service: 
The staff is very helpful, and you can sample things to help decide what to order.

Atmosphere:
It's a small shop tucked into a nondescript strip mall. The place is clean, but don't come here for the atmosphere, come for the food! 

Overall:
So ya, I like this place for the service and the food. When you visit, tell Meeno the owner that Jim said hi!  :-) 

Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was good, big portion!!   Service was poor.  Tables were all dirty, the girl behind the counter seemed more interested in her boyfriend working who was working with her."}
{"text":"Everytime I'm in the area, I stop here for some delicious middle eastern food. They have gluten free options as well as vegetarian plates. The spicy tahini sauce is crazy delicious...as well as theoir tzaziki dip (spelling?)..."}
{"text":"This is my kinda place. Healthy, explosion of fresh flavors served by happy & cool employees at a great price! Being 1 mile away means I'll be coming back to try several other menu items. 
The usual 1st time item is the chicken shawarma and baklava. Grrrrreat! I went for the chipotle hummus which was spicy & smooth. Only tab bit of complaint, add another pita or two. I'll finish this hummus w chips that I've got.
I'll eventually try everything"}
{"text":"Had this at the Arab American festival for the first time yesterday. It was amazing. So many delicious flavors. Had the chicken gyro it's unbelievably tasty. The owner and staffs are very friendly. The cucumber lemonade was amazing as well."}
{"text":"When this place opened a few years ago it was awesome. I stopped in today and I'm so disappointed in the lack of customer service. 
The counter person was chewing gum and indifferent. The coke machines don't work and they didn't have much of a choice for canned drinks. 
There were 3 people before us and we've been waiting 25 minutes to get our food.
My onions on kurshari were not caramelized. I asked for hot sauce but they put it out on the food instead of giving it on the side. I wanted to taste my food. 
Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This little shop has a grubby feel to it but they have quick and tasty Mediterranean food. I was excited to see koshari on the menu since I've only seen it on TV. I had heard that this Egyptian dish is a popular street food since it's fast, cheap, and filling. I wanted a little variety so I got the plate which includes a small side salad and one side dish with pita chips or bread. I had the spicy baba ganoush with pita bread. You get your spice preference on the koshari sauce too (Mild, medium, hot). I had the hot sauce.

The koshari was indeed quite hearty, filled with macaroni, rice, lentils, topped with a delicious tomato based sauce and caramelized onions. I liked the mixture of textures and flavors from the slightly crispy, sweet onions to the soft pasta. The heat level was just right for me. Although this was a vegan dish I didn't miss the dairy or meat at all.

The salad was crisp and refreshing, filled with romaine lettuce, feta, cucumber, tomato and dressing (I opted for no raw onion). The spicy baba ganoush wasn't as spicy as the sauce in the koshari and had too much of an overpowering acidic flavor to me. I did enjoy the smokiness of the eggplant though. The pita bread it was served with was fresh and hot but super oily.

My total for the koshari plate with tax was a little over $8.

If I'm in the area I'd come back to try more off the menu."}
{"text":"Omly place in town to serve Koshari bowl.  Super spicy, super tasty! Just like you'd find in Egypt.  Great mint lime-aide too"}
{"text":"An Oasis in sea of fast food along I-10. Falafel crusted with sesame seeds. Vegan friendly."}
{"text":"I had the gyro bowl. It was quick, but the guy at the register didn't bother to help me or say anything when I said it was my first time in. The food was good. Would go back here again"}
{"text":"We came here on a whim because we had no idea what else we wanted for lunch. The gyros were, I think, better than Niros Gyros. Their portions are huge and everything is really tasty. I liked trying the different hummus's and the baba ganoush. The owner was really cool. He let us try a sample of the cucumber lemonade. Wow that stuff is amazing!! The only disappointing things were my boyfriend wanted fries and they were out and the prices were very high for a fast food type joint. We'd come back for sure next time we're in the area but I hope they would lower their prices a bit. That would be the only reason we might pass on them if we didn't feel like spending that much."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch based on Yelp reviews. It was a good lunch spot. Plenty of food, tasty and good customer service. It was just too hot in there without AC to really enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Either my thirst is real or they accidentally spilled the salt container on the shawarma container before placing it in the heating dish. The spicy baba ganoush was good but the overly salty chicken forced me to ask for a side of regular hummus to balance the flavor. It wasn't too bad but the fact that I paid over $10 for a medium sized lunch and a pathetic salad makes me not want to come back, even with the yelp check in offer."}
{"text":"Very good food and at a very good realistic price. I dropped in to get lunch and got the gyro wrap. The food was very good given that it was cooked by a guy who isn't from the Mediterranean area. I got the combo and it was worth it for the portions of the food. The fries were very good as well. Yes I am reviewing the fries, they were that good and they were packaged. so who ever he's ordering his stuff from, he should keep going to them."}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner after a busy day of walking.. we were starving.. 

We ordered the large hummus.. the staff was nice enough to get it to us before the rest of our food was ready.. the jalapeño cilantro hummus with pita bread was fresh and flavorful.. yum.. but the large size only comes with one pita.. it should come with at least two if not three at no extra charge 

I had the chicken shawarma with fries on the side.. plenty of meat, fresh veggies and taziki.. decent size order, flavors were on point.. my bf had the gyro and fries.. he said it was delicious .. we used our fries to finish up the rest of the hummus since we ran out of pita bread even though we bought an extra one

Small dining area.. tucked in the shopping center by floors & decor across the street from Walmart.."}
{"text":"Yum! I had cucumber lemonade & a GREAT vegan koshari plate w/ salad, hummus,& a pita! 
All for Only $10!!! 
It was super Delicious with good portions! I'm definitely coming here more often."}
{"text":"Love their beek shawarma rice bowls! Not crazy expensive. Rice bowl can be made into a combo. They have flavored humms. Really good."}
{"text":"Food was great, and the staff was patient while we asked lots of questions about the menu. I'll definitely be back! You must try the cucumber lemonade!"}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for years whenever we venture this way from the west valley because the food was always good. So tonight we stopped by with our two kids after going to ikea.Tonight, however, we were disappointed by the fact that they were out of the beef schwarma which my husband loves and to top it off, when we ordered a soda and some cups for  water. The lady at the counter told us, \" just so you know, the soda only comes with 1 refill, so if you're thinking of sharing the soda, you can't\" I find that really rude to assume that we would all share the 1 soda. Especially we each ordered a separate dinner, even my 10 year old ordered an adult portion., not kid's. Our bill came out to over $38.... so why so misery about soda refills? Especially since they gave us a tiny cup for the soda.It's ridiculous, since there's endless other restaurants throughout the valley that doesn't  assume their customers are out to \"cheat\" them. This is the first time I've eaten here and didn't leave a tip, even though it's not a full service restaurant, I always usually leave a tip as a courtesy. I doubt I will ever come back again, they just lost us as customers over some sad soda refills, I hope it was worth it."}
{"text":"Very tasty. A little pricey, use a yelp first timer discount but with sides and drinks about $11-12/person. Small eatery, friendly staff. Close to shopping."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've already eaten here twice in the two weeks it's been open. Everything they offer on their menu is fresh and authentic. I had the chicken shawarma plate with a Greek salad, tzikii and baba ghanoush. It was outstanding! They had delicious fresh cucumber lemonade on hand to wash it down too. Mmmmm! Their cream and jello dessert is amazing too so be sure and save room. The service at Tzikii is just as wonderful as the food and the restaurant is clean and inviting. Seriously, you've got to give Tzikii a try. You will be happy you did! :)"}
{"text":"The gyro's are amazing and you do get your money's worth on the meat portions. The french fries are great I think it's because they deep fry in the same fryer as the falafel so it seasons it. The Tzikii sauce isn't too thick or too watery or heavy on the dill weed either. I'm Catholic and during Lent this place has been a good  \"go to\" for Meatless Friday's for the falafel and koshari bowl."}
{"text":"The gyro meat is good very wish I just got the gyro instead of plate.  The rice was bland / has no taste.  And the pita side was hard to chew.  The salad was good and the hummus is better than sabra.  I'll be back but will get the gyro sandwich.  The staff is friendly and very helpful"}
{"text":"Amazing tasty fresh food! If anyone tells you anything different?? I have been eating here for more than a year, they always customize my order the way i want it. This restaurant is mainly middle eastern Egyptian cuisine. Koshari is a great vegan dish, you can get it mild or spicy, i am not vegan i always ask them to mix it with chicken shawarma meat and tzikii sauce, SOOO GOOD . 
Some of the negative reviews here! Seriously out of ignorance. You need to know what you want and ask for it thats part of being an adult, lol. You can't expect them to know how you like it exactly. Part of it is you understanding what middle eastern authentic food is, and what is actually considered real middle eastern food. There are ALOT of places in AZ claim being middle eastern, being one myself, mcdonalds sometimes is more authentic than them, but Tzikii is definitely authentic middle eastern fresh food, Give it a try"}
{"text":"I had the chicken shawarma bowl, it was pretty decent, good flavors and quick service. This place is close to work and while it is not my favorite Mediterranean place, I will revisit."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! I've tried the Koshari and the chicken shawarma plate, and they are both delicious. The hummus is very tasty, especially the jalapeño hummus. The chicken is cooked perfectly and not dry! (and I hate dry chicken). I also LOVE their baklava, I could eat it every day! It's not overly sweet but hits the spot. Also, their cucumber lemonade is very refreshing. The location is a bit hidden, in the same plaza as Starbucks and Floor & Decor."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE the food here! From the hummus (jalapeño/cilantro, chipotle both very flavorful and user friendly heatwise), cucumber slices and pita to the gyro and chicken shwarma. Nothing is dull for your mouth. Cucumber lemonade also should not be missed. Surprise, all you nutella fans: it's in the baklava :) Stellar service every time even if they are rushed. Guys: for real... You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"I am updating my review from 5 stars to 3. I have been coming here once a week for lunch about 3 months now. I get something different every time.

I noticed recently that they are getting a bit lazy with how they make and prepare their food. Recently I've been getting very little sauce in the chicken shawarma bowl, sometimes it's very little rice and today I got a salad with no dressing. Needless to say, when I figured that out after getting back to work - I didn't eat the salad. Waste of $7.

Hopefully these guys get their act back together."}
{"text":"Omg, I have to tell you, the gyro here is the best in the Phoenix area. I come from Los Angeles where we are exposed to all international cuisines.. and although, gyro may seem like the McDonald's of ethnic cuisines, it's still a hit or miss.. and this place hits it. Not to mention the smell of warm pita and different meats that are intoxicating when you are pulling up. I highly recommend this place. The service is top notch and it can't be beat. Drooollll..."}
{"text":"Pretty typical Mediterranean grill - I had a lunch plate with hummus and beef, and the staff hilariously forgot to put beef on it. It wasn't even busy lol. But they hopped right to it when I pointed it out, and meat and pita were tasty, though the accompanying rice and salad a little bland."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few months now, several times a month (sometimes twice a week since they are so close!). I love the small, cozy seating and the food is always so good. Depending on who made the food that day though, it could be different, but it's always good. Sometimes they don't have the coconut chicken I love, but they accommodate by making a batch for me. Great for a quick lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant one afternoon for lunch
I had seeing the salad advertised on the menu 
and on Yelp
The chicken Schworm a salad 
so I decided to go ahead and try that there was a great quantity of rubbish lettuce the meat quality was not so great


Thanks for your response 
It happens
It could have been just That One Day 
I went in the meat was Just medium quality 
Thanks"}
{"text":"went to Tzikii Pita Grill a few weekends ago and I must stay this little spot in Tempe is definitely the place to go for Greek / Mediterranean cuisine. this place is great for a quick lunch or dinner meal with nice service. I had the vegan dish koshari it had lentils, garbanzo beans, cut cucumbers and it was a good portion. I also had some hummus and a warmed pita. when I am in the Tempe area again, I will for sure, make my way there again."}
{"text":"Haven't had a great tasting Gyro in a long time. This restaurant sure did fulfill every aspect in serving a meaty Gyro just the way I like it . Eight Ounces of meat balanced with Tzikii sauce, lettuce and cucumbers rolled up in pita bread. I had a basket of fries as a side nothing spectacular about them. 

Welcoming service starting with greeting to checking on you of how the food taste. Suitable for children, families and small groups."}
{"text":"Beef shawarma is packed with flavor. Falafel is crunchy and tasty. Baba ghanoush is phenomenal with the perfect amount of tang! Greek fries are crunchy and the Greek vinaigrette is full of flavor. Lastly,  don't leave here without getting a cucumber lemonade!"}
