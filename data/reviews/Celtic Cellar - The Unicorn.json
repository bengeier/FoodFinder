{"text":"Do not go here for their $8 sirloin burgers, they almost gave me a heart attack! Even my gf had stomach problems the next morning :( They are store bought processed burgers, probably no name brand, cause I've ate a lot of the good name brand and i know what processed burger is all about. It was so bad we couldn't even finish the processed burger. When I went to pay the bill, I gave the guy a small tip but I was really considering not giving a tip at all because of the false advertisement and he gave me attitude about the tip like there was some justification on his side."}
{"text":"I've only had wings and beer here.  Thursday is wings for 19Â¢ each.  I think it's orders of 10 for wings.  It's a basement location, the Celtic Cellar that is, formerly called Below Deck but now part of the Unicorn \"superpub\".   I've been coming here occasionally for few years, mostly with co-workers.  I'm mostly a casual guy, but like micro-brews, they don't seem to have any of those here.    They have different specials depending on the evening of the week.  I haven't tried any except for the wings.    Atmosphere is a basement with rustic stone walls.  I think it's a bit cooler down here in a hot day.  They sometimes have some live music, which I think is pretty great.  The music they play is a bit older and more in the range of classic rock, 80's, 90's, generally.  I like what they play here.  I've been here perhaps 8 times over the last 4 years.  I like the casual nature off the place and the music."}
{"text":"Terrible, we went on Sunday, February 19th.  When we  walked in (top floor) we saw at least 5 tables that were full of dirty dishes and glasses, so unable to find a more convenient table we had to find a place nearer to the back. We were not greeted once and we waited about 7 minutes before we decided to leave. 7 Minutes may not seem like a terribly long time, but with only three people seated at the bar and one other table of 5 people, it did not seem too busy enough to fail at an acknowledgement in all that time. The toilets were disgusting, in fact one bathroom had a womens \"used\" feminine product floating in the toilet in addition to the hair all over the sinks and toilet paper strewn all over the floor. We will never go back again, I am glad we didn't see the kitchen."}
