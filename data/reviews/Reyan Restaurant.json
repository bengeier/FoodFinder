{"text":"Fantastic food. Tastes as if you went to a restaurant in Damascus. The freekeh with lamb is always a good choice. The lamb falls off the bone, the freekeh (smoked wheate grains) is flavoured with spices and is super delicious.

I've also tried the shawarma, hummus, fatoush, and kabseh. All hits. It's great to see a restaurant pumping out food this authentic tasting in the GTA."}
{"text":"I read the article about the lovely owner in the Toronto Star and visited. The shawarma was moist and flavorful and very tasty. I will be back to see the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Reyan since they were at their old location, and over time, their shawarmas have become smaller as their price went up. They have a deal for 2 shawarmas for 7.99 which is decent, but they put as little condiments on it as possible. When I asked for more garlic sauce and pickled turnips, the guy said I'll need to pay full price for the shawarma if I wanted a bit more toppings on it. I didn't want to make a big deal out of it at the time, but after that incident I've stopped going to Reyans and started going to the shawarma place right across it (in the plaza the other side of dundas). 

Reyan still makes a decent shawarma, but considering that it's so easily found, they should remain more competitive; they aren't the only shawarma store in Mississauga. Shrinking the size and reducing the quality of shawarmas while raising the price of it doesn't help. 

The shawarma place across the street is a bit more expensive than Reyans but literally twice the size of Reyans. If you want a real quality shawarma check out Aladin's nearby, they're MUCH better than Reyans"}
{"text":"I have ordered five different meals today for take out, all of them were super delicious, it's the best middle eastern food I have ever had, the owner is very friendly, I'd definitely order from here again.. Thanks Reyan"}
{"text":"One of the best Middle Eastern food in Canada I have ever tried. Very authentic. High quality. Really really delicious."}
{"text":"Although I'm not a big fan of the area, this place serves the best authentic Arabian food in town. Dishes here are not found in homes and they are made as good as the ones we make in our homes. I wish to see this restaurant scaling out in better neighbourhoods."}
{"text":"In my opinion, the three most important criteria to evaluate a restaurant are:
1. cleanliness of the place and the food
2. deliciousness of the food
3. Politeness of staff

Reyan Restaurant scores 5/5 on all three. That's why I'm giving the restaurant 5 stars. For someone who cares about the ambiance a lot, one would probably have to subtract between 1 and 1.5 stars, but I always leave this restaurant so happy and pleased, the ambiance doesn't matter to me.

1. The gentleman who runs this place respects his customers in two ways: keeping the place clean for them and choosing the best ingredients in preparing their food. If you go to the washrooms, for example, you might be able to find some areas of chipped off paint on the walls, but you will not find a speck of dirt. They are always cleaned so thoroughly as if an honoured guest is about to come to use them. With regards to the food, I'll use the shawarma to make my point. I've ordered both Arabic chicken shawarma and Arabic beef shawarma in the past from Reyan, with a preference for the latter, and I ate the little gourmet sandwiches with confidence and without unwrapping them to check the ingredients. In most restaurants that serve shawarma, I order it on a plate rather than on a sandwich because their shawarma involves disgusting bits of skin and chunks of fat, which I consider a sign of great disrespect for customers. At Reyan restaurant, that is not the case. You get served the best cuts of meat and your food is made with premium ingredients.
2. At Reyan, I've learned that you don't have to order shawarma every time you go to a middle eastern restaurant, but instead open your horizon and try the non-fast food items! Whatever I've tried, I've been so happy and pleased with. The lamb here is spectacular, so delicious and tender. I've tried Lamb with Freekeh, Lamb with Rice, and Mansaf Jamid. I love them all, but I'll mention that the Mansaf Jamid is served with Jamid, which tastes like a derivative of yogurt, so if you're not a fan of yogurt, you'll want to go for the first two instead. Otherwise, try  the Mansaf and explore new flavours! I've also ordered Yabrak (stuffed grape leaves with a few other sides) and Malfoof (stuffed cabbage leaves). These are the best stuffed grape leaves I've had in a restaurant. I like them both, but have a slight preference for the cabbage ones. Another favourite of mine is Basmashkat. It consists of a tender thin slice of beef stuffed with rice and ground beef and is served with mashed potatoes and a flavourful tomato-based stew. At serving time, the chef comes to remove the thread that held the beef while cooking so you don't have to worry about eating it! I have also tried a few other items and have been pleasantly surprised, but hope to get the courage to try more new meals. The food is so clean and delicious and makes you feel comfy you're eating it!
3. Lastly, the gentleman who runs this place is extremely polite and courteous, which adds to the enjoyment of the food!


UPDATE (6/2/2018):

Their shawarma sandwiches were one of my favourites because of deliciousness and lack of yucky skin and fat bits. The second last time I ordered the chicken shawarma sandwich, I discovered skin/fat bits in it. I was shocked. The last time I ordered shawarma from them, I ordered the beef shawarma plate to give me the opportunity to analyze the meat. By the end of the meal, I had a pile of skin/fat that I would not serve any guest of mine. I hope this is an unusual occurrence and not a change of the recipes to emulate the low quality shawarma restaurants all across the GTA.

For now, the only other restaurant I know that serves clean (no skin/fat bits) in both their chicken and beef shawarma dishes is Tarboosh restaurant in Mississauga.

I hope Reyan Restaurant fixes this issue and reverts to its past high standards."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for new foods and Reyan serves a few dishes that you won't find elsewhere in the GTA. You can get shawarma and kebobs anywhere so I went for the more exotic Monsaf Jamid and the lamb freeka. 

For $20 each, my verdict is just an \"ok\". The lamb was fairly tender but the flavor wasn't anything to go crazy for. I mean...it was delicious but not anything mind blowing. Portion wise it's decent. It's not a very nice dine-in places but then again, most middle eastern places are the same.

I would recommend you try it once at least. It's quite hard to find true Arabic restaurants in the GTA besides your usual Shawarma/Kebob places."}
{"text":"I went there after a recommendation by my friend , I wasn't disappointed at all ...the menu is very diverse many dishes to try from i definitely will come back for more I tried a Jordanian traditional dish Mansaf and it was tasty ! only comment was that the yogurt or (jameed) was a bit small for the portion, aside from that it's an excellent place , super friendly owner I'm assuming and very clean and fast service 
can't wait to try the other dishes"}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided to stop by for an \"Authentic\" Shawarma.  Located in a busy little strip plaza on the north side of Dundas W.  Free parking.  6buck for one Chicken Shawarma.  No more special two for 7buck deal anymore.   The service was fast seeing that I was the only person in the place.  The interior is old and drab but clean.  As for the food, the Chicken Shawarma was a tad bit on the dry side but had some nice flavour.   Sadly, I have had better elsewhere.   It was also very thin and left me hungry for more."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place. I really really wanted to rave about it because of all the great reviews I read. However, that is sadly not the case. 

I ordered the lamb freekah, despite the high price of $23 (yes, they have increased the price of all their menu items). The portion size, while not small, is not worth the high price. I was excited to see large chunks of lamb in my dish, but was soon disappointed to find that half of it (no exaggeration) was either fat or bone. Thankfully, the meat was very tender, but that's about the only good thing about the dish. The freekah was okay. Definitely not as flavourful as other dishes I've had, and the small sprigs of parsley did nothing to elevate the flavour. 

Overall, a huge disappointment and a loss of $23 ($25 after tax). I really don't understand how a restaurant can charge that much and yet serve meat that is half fat and bone."}
{"text":"Halal meat is served here per signs on the window. Went here recently for late lunch.  Owner is friendly, but the service is slow (I guess cuz its a one man show).  The food was average and a bit pricey.  Servings were a little on the small size as well, considering the cost.  Had the lamb shawerma plate (good), the mixed BBQ kebab plate (OK), and the Cordon Bleu (disappointing).  A lot of the meat was tough and the Cordon Bleu was semi-burnt and tough.  Food took a long time to prepare, so I would suggest you call ahead and pick-up the food instead of ordering in."}
{"text":"My brother had read an article about this place several months back and we were both intrigued and excited to try authentic Syrian cuisine. (Turns out it's very similar to most Middle Eastern food.)

I decided to order the Chicken Shawarma, even though the displayed menu is a little confusing in terms of finding things. Anyway, I placed my order and was told to have a seat by the owner.

A little while later, I was asked what I wanted in my shawarma (everything, obviously) and the finished wrap was then placed in a press for several minutes.

When I received it, it was piping hot (always a good sign). The wrap had been rendered almost flat by the press and the exterior was crispy without being burnt or hard. Honestly, this was delicious. One of the best chicken shawarmas I've had in a while. My only complaint would be the relative sparseness of the chicken; the chicken pieces were so good I was desperate for more."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but any place that is rude and inconsiderate enough to post NO hours on their door, or online...gets a bad review from me. The only thing I'm offered is wasted time and gas."}
{"text":"Amazing food at a very reasonable price. At one point I thought nothing could beat the taste at Osmows, but this place does. Given the quantity isn't what it used to be as before, the taste is still good and the owner has started running specials which is why he may have cut down on the size of the shawarmas."}
{"text":"Came here for a late but light meal, so I had the shawarma salad. 
It was really good, very flavorful, no fatty meat pieces and it was beautifully presented (I was pleasantly surprised)
The owner is very friendly and inviting

A hidden gem....new fave! 
will definitely return"}
