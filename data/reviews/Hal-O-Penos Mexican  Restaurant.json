{"text":"Nice little divey type place, but I liked it!  Great service, and quickly greeted with very good Chips and Salsa.  I went for the Green Carnitas and it was everything I could ask for. Tender meat, great flavor, not too salty. Grilled veggies mixed in were great!  Tortillas were nice and soft.  Try this place out if you're on the West Side."}
{"text":"Good but they use lard. So anyone watching their fat and cholesterol needs to watch out. You can taste it in the beans. Most Mexican restaurants in this area have stopped using that stuff."}
{"text":"I have loved this place for a long time.We used to go there when they were at 35th & Northern.Great food and NO they are not expensive.Their salsa is wonderful."}
{"text":"Let me start off with: THE NAME IS HILARIOUS! Haha  The decor is kind of run down. Chipped paint. Old tables. They need a paint job.   Food- Good. I got the sampler. It had tostadas, a tamale, chicken chimichangas, beef chimichangas, beef tacos, beans, and rice.  -The green tamale had too much manteca (lard), not enough flavor. -The tostadas were okay.  -the beef tacos were good.  -the rice was good.  -the beans: blegh. Flavorless.  -the best thing on that plate were the chimichangas! Yummers!  They give you endless chips and salsa and that's great! I just wish the salsa was spicier and wasn't pure tomato.   Service was good, but they kind of took a long time. I love the music! Affordable prices. Cute place but not my first choice."}
{"text":"Very good food, but prices are high for what you get. Decent interior, nice decor for smaller sized mexican restaurant. They serve the typical beers. Service was solid."}
{"text":"This place is magic! Their salsa is out of this world, and their margaritas are stellar! The service is awesome as well. We love Tony, he is always on top of refilling our drinks, and refreshing our chip basket! Try their cheese enchilada comb, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times how ever tonight was not the best. I ordered a bean burrito and the beans tasted spoiled sour."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Jack-in-the-Box for a quick coffee and what did I see???  HAL'S HAS REOPENED in the old Lai Lai space. YEAH!"}
{"text":"Just as wonderful as ever. All the familiar smiling faces. Same great food  Looks like Hal's is moving back to the old neighborhood. I see a sign at 35th and Northern where the Mongollian Grill used to be."}
{"text":"I'm giving four stars. This restaurant has been around for a long time. I absolutely love their mini chimis. Tha jalepono cream cheese dip and mini chimi are very good. The only reason I don't give five was went there just last night, and the service was terrible. One refill on my drink, had to ask other waitresses for more chips, and more drink, while our waitress stood at the other end of the place a gabbed away...after looking again the bad experience was at the 35th Ave and northern location."}
{"text":"Glad they found a new home and close to mine. Great lunch specials and love the chips and salsa. Very friendly staff. This is my local neighborhood spot to go for lunch or dinner when I am too tired to cook."}
