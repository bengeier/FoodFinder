{"text":"First, I'd like to say that Jade's really does have good Chinese food.  They have a spicy flat rice noodle dish that I absolutely love and the prices are comparable to other Chinese food places in the area.

Unfortunately Jade's has succumbed to horrible service over the last little while.  They used to have a very polite and attentive girl looking after phones and service but they seemed to have canned her about a year ago.  Without her, I dread ordering.  It takes forever for anyone to pick up the phone and when someone does answer they're not very polite.

If you can tolerate phoning multiple times and unfriendly service, I would probably recommend trying it out.  However, I've spent far too long trying to place orders and I've decided that after a long day at work I don't want something as simple as ordering food to be my last hurdle before I can relax for the night.  For this reason, I doubt I'm ever going back."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite place for Chinese food in town.  The last couple of times we tried it was AWFUL!!!

Very little flavor.   Chicken balls are all batter with very little chicken inside.  Battered shrimp...same thing...no flavour. Cantonese Chow Men had 2 shrimp in it and was dripping in oil.

We used to order fairly regularly but won't be going back.  It's time to find another place."}
{"text":"Jade's is obviously a take-out joint but, not being from Stouffville, and having worked up an appetite from strawberry picking, we wanted to eat right away, so we knowingly made the error of dining-in. We did search in vain for an outdoor bench in the plaza or nearby park while waiting nearly 30mins for our food but to no avail. It's a shame because it was a beautiful summer day.

The service was slow at Jade's and their english was bad making ordering for special dietary needs difficult. The food was a pretty standard North American chinese take-out fare, nothing special, produce less than fresh. The vegetables were cut fairly sloppily and chunky with some visible browning around the edges of the carrots. It came loaded with globs of MSG, which probably could have been expected. 

They had a rough looking table and set of chairs that we pieced together to eat at. The table was dirty which added to the unpleasantness of the experience. I think they probably keep it this way to discourage people from dining-in. 

I've eaten at quite a few, run-of-the-mill, Chinese, take-out joints in strip malls in Florida and New York, and can say that they all had better seating situations than Jade's and actually provide table service at a few of them. I think one of the gentlemen behind the counter took pity on us because he offered us some styrofoam plates when he saw us eating  directly out of the containers.

There were plenty of vegetarian(so they say) options on the menu but I felt pretty ill after having my mixed vegetables and tofu. We were there mid-afternoon and they didn't have any white rice prepared so we had to wait a bit longer after the food arrived for the rice to be ready. No discount was offered for the delayed rice but they did give me a heaping portion.

It's pretty clear that Jade's operates its business of a take-out only basis serving clientele with low-standards for Chinese food. They might not have any competition in Stouffville. If you have the time, you're better off driving to Markham or Richmond Hill to eat Chinese. I recommend Gourmet Vegetarian.

The next time I go strawberry picking, I'm definitely going to bring a picnic lunch."}
{"text":"I like this tiny take out place. The lady is very friendly and the food really taste of 0 msg. We go get our take out once a week."}
{"text":"It used to be good but since they hired a new cook 6 mnths ago IT IS GARBAGE!  2 pieces of chicken in our so called chicken dish  all carrots! DO NOT WASTE Your TIME!"}
