{"text":"I've been here twice and both times food and service have been great.  Sashimi was fresh, and they have some different stuff from what's on the regular ayce menu of other restaurants.  Some stuff I feel are stand outs are the noodle soups, which has a nice drinkable soup base and other things like enoki mushrooms.  They also serve black sesame ice cream (NOT the white stuff with black seeds), and the best banana tempura I've had in any ayce resto."}
{"text":"Try it last weekend. Just like any other AYCE. Service was good. Fish was fresh. The only thing I don't like was the squid - both cook/raw."}
{"text":"FOOD : quick served, doesn't have to wait too long (even we came on Friday evening).  Size per dish is a bit small but it's even better : U can choose and enjoy different type from ALL U CAN EAT menu. Nice serving plate (and clean).   Recommend : small dish of various types of salad (I love Mango ones, comes with color pepers). Salmon Sashimi. Beef rolled with Mashroom.  Good desserts (than others' ALL U CAN EAT which their desserts is so watery)  SERVICE : Nice and tips is already included when paid (besides taxes).  DECOR : Nice and quite romantic. And, quite comfoy seating. (the table we sat is just across the hall behind the cash counter).  TIP : Cut coupon from Chinese' Sing Tao Saturday' Magazine, which they had 15% off if you pay by CASH. (But they still accept Credit Cards)   p.s. I think I will go back again !!!"}
{"text":"I thought it was newly opened, it should be quite decent.  However, when I poured the soya sauce out to the dish, I saw a little fly there (those very tiny ones) .... ok, asked the waitress to change a new one, and the service seemed ok.   The sashimi is OK, but the Sushi pizza is really really bad, it's cold and harden (the pizza part) . I was very disappointed for that..   I also ordered fried noodles , disappointed, it's not professionally seasoned and cooked, it's more like a CHinese fried noodles.  Terriyaki beef, can't chew it, it's even worse than a bubble gum!  And do I have to mention about the flies again??  I totally saw three flies in my soya sauce dish... it's crazy! How come there were so many flies flying in the restaurant? Now you can judge the cleanness of the environment.  Sorry, I won't go back again!!"}
{"text":"the atmosphere is great but saw the waitress picking her nose across our table, will not go back anymore"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today. Aside from its decor, there's not much memorable moments to comment about.   The decor was nice and modern with dark ambient lighting.  The dining room is clean, streamlined, and easy on the eyes. They even have a special party booth decorated like a traditional japanese dining table set at floor level with little pillows where chairs would normally be.  Now to the food.  The food was mediocre with nothing too special about it whether it be looks or taste. The staple AYCE items are there but I think other places make the same things better.    The only dish that I can comment on is the fried bananas under the desserts category. Those little suckers were delicious!  Covered with a super crispy batter (that's not tempura like most other AYCE places) a perfectly ripe banana and drizzled with honey, this dish was just divine. The banana was not mushy, had a good girth, and did not give way after just one bite. Even after all the sushi, sashimi, etc., I still downed a plate of those bananas.  Even if I wouldn't go back for the main food items, I would definitely go back just to eat those bananas!  All in all, the food wasn't good or bad, but the decor made it comfortable to eat in.  The highlight of the night was the fried bananas for sure."}
{"text":"Apparently changed owners/names since the last time I was in the area.  They have an all you care to eat lunch with penalty phase for unfinished Whig I found interesting.  What I didn't find interesting was both the soy sauce and wasabi were quite tasteless. What usually would have burnt my nose hairs out quantity of wasabi I tasted nothing and the salty tang of soy sauce was missing.  I'm not sure if we got a bad bottle or what but it was flavorless for both of us.  The rolls we ordered came out quite fast and the chicken noodle soup I had was good, but the low flavor from the spy sauce and wasabi was a let down.  We hit it after the lunch rush and service was a bit I attentive and we had to hunt someone down to pay the bill"}
{"text":"Been here twice, the first time it was not bad. Had a huge group of 15 people and they gave us the VIP room.  It is very quiet for the AYCE Japanese as there was only 3-4 other table.  The Service is terrible here as the servers are very rude and likes to hide behind the counter and not come assist you.  The second time I went it was even worst that I will never come back.  First we had 10 people and it wasn't even busy, we asked for the room and the server just ignored us.  So I asked another server and she gave me this ugly look and said in broken English \"No, not available.\" So we got stuck in the main room with another table.  The seating was so uncomfortable especially if you didn't get the bench, the seating didn't have back support and it was kind of small. I am not a big guy and it was bad, I don't know how bigger people going to sit there.    So at Osechi you write your own orders on paper but only 1/4 of your food actually came.  And the sashimi pieces keeps getting smaller and smaller - quality getting worst.  I asked for 25 piece of salmon sashimi only 10 came so I put in a few more orders.  By the 5th order all the servers saw us calling for them and all disappeared I can clearly see them peaking out.  This is before they spoke to the sushi bar (he might be the manager or owner) and told them most likely not to take any more orders from us; we did order a lot but we finished everything and was still hungry.  I got so sick of hunting these servers just to put a order in that only 1/4 came in so we just gave up and asked for dessert.  Only thing good is that the have black sesame ice cream, mango pudding and deep fried banana.    I would not return for such lousy service and okay food quality with so much competition for AYCE sushi out there for around the same price.  I wouldn't be surprise if this place be gone within the end of the year as well as this location keep changing every time I go to this plaza.

{"text":"Being less than a year old, we gave this place a try as an alternative to Ten-Ichi as recommended by a family friend. We made a reservation for 8 and upon arrival the place was quite packed (New Year's Eve). The atmosphere was nice and gave the place a light purple ambiance. Decor is quite well done. Seating was decent, unlike the compact Ten-Ichi, which has us elbow to elbow with one another.  Service was terrible. The waiters/waitresses were unresponsive to our orders (of which we think only 60% made its way to the kitchen) and consequently, customer service was terrible. There were only 5 servers visible, and food came in between ridiculously long intervals. Sometimes a single dish would arrive (the salmon belly had a large dish to itself... though it was only the size of my thumb...) and other times large dishes would flood the table.  AYCE sushi is often easily judged by the quality of its sashimi. In this case, the sashimi was served at a good temperature (cold but not frozen), though the texture was a bit on the soft side. 8/10 for me.  We ordered a ton of teriyaki/stir fries... all though they were good, they all tasted the same - we think they used the same sauce for everything, but just changed up the ingredients (i.e. broccoli in one, none in the other)  The tempura was a bit on the chewy side, though the food was all served fresh - hot off the stove you could tell.  Gotta give them points for having creative rolls though - they had mango rolls, asian rolls (avec \"special sauce\"), and used cream cheese in a lot of it.   The worst part about this place is definitely the dropping of our orders and inconsistent food-serving.   Best part was probably the Black Sesame Ice Cream - to die for. The Deep fried Bananas were tasteless... the bananas themselves we suspect were not ripe enough...  I would definitely come here again, but not deliberately. For AYCE sushi, Ten-Ichi is still my #1."}
{"text":"In a word: \"Bland\". Everything about this place is one step below average. The service; impersonal. The food; somewhat tasteless. The atmosphere; certainly not Japanese! In fact...everything is Chinese; employees, music and lack of customer service attitude (shares parking lot with the Bank of China office building, so go figure). But then again, what do you expect from an all you can eat place - something I didn't know until it was too late to run. Also, doesn't take AMEX."}
{"text":"The black sesame ice cream on the AYCE menu is a pleasant surprise. The rest is a big pile of meh. The rice is pretty terrible. We went for a second round and included the ice cream (red bean and sesame) on the tick sheet. Oddly the ice cream came first before the sushi items. Hmmm. Lots of AYCE sushi places don't have the most brilliant ability to get ordered items to your actual table. We weren't sure if our second round of sushi choices ended up in AYCE purgatory so we started in on the sesame ice cream. It's a bit of an odd taste at the start but smooths out in a creamy delight as it melts in your mouth."}
{"text":"Had dinner here and it wasn't bad at all. All you can eat for less than $25 is very good and you get 10% off if you pay cash! Sushi was fresh and well prepared. Service was a bit slow but the food made up for it.  A nice find in a out of the way place."}
{"text":"Completely unimpressed: food was average, some things less so, and the service was typical of most Asian restaurants (i.e. lacking) There are definitely better AYCE sushi places out there. Not worth your money."}
{"text":"This review is for their lunch specials which range from $7.95-10.95.   Service \"was\" good before 12 pm when the restaurant was empty. But when people started coming in, it went crazy. I asked for utensils and it did not arrive until after I ate my meal. With my hands. (haha it was ribs, and no I'm usually not barbaric :P haha especially when I'm with company). I noticed other people trying to wave down the wait staff and then waiting for a long time too. I actually made eye contact with some of them awkwardly, I guess wondering which one of us would get the attention of the waitstaff first. haha  The lunch specials come with a miso tofu soup (ok), two fried dumplings (small, and oily), california rolls (tiny and sad looking but taste ok), two salmon sushi, and salad loaded with dressing. The salad was just a small bed of lettuce which was very watery but it was masked by a mount of the orange topping / dressing. I got the kalbi special so there was four pieces of kalbi. It was pretty good but I noticed they put the tiny pieces on the bottom and the larger two pieces on the top. Sneaky!   Anyways I guess if you're working in this area, this might be a good lunch option but it's really nothing special."}
{"text":"I just went there tonight and I think it was pretty good !   But there are some things to improve on: - restaurant is too dark so it needs to be brighter - sashimi (salmon esp) shouldnt be sliced too thick. It should be cut as thin as possible.    The good things at Osechi: - service was good :) - other food was great - delicious - green tea ice-cream is strong but not too bitter"}
{"text":"Thought we were coming in to DOZO but instead we found out they had closed !!!! :( So sad... it was one of my favourites places.  This place has now turned into AYCE...Jen K's favourite lol You don't have to order AYCE but if u intend on eating more... that's the way to go.  Portions were a little small imho esp the sushi pizza! But it sure was tasty. I especially loved the eel avocado roll , arctic... ^^ Not a bit sashimi fan but I did have one and it was fresh. However it was on the small side...guess you just have to order more :) Service was good.  Adult 13.95 (lunch), 22.95 (dinner) Senior (65+) 11.95 (lunch), 19.95 (dinner) Kids (5-12 ) 9.95 (lunch), 15.95 dinner 4  years under 2.95 (lunch & dinner)  might cost $1-2 more on special weekends.  I don't mind coming back but I might go for lunch instead.  The decor is still the same as Dozo...quite nice :) I'm gonna miss Dozo!"}
{"text":"Black Sesame Ice Cream Overdosed!  Osechi Japanese Cuisine is just like DOZO everything is the same, aside from the menu, the staffs and the name of the restaurant.  Grand Opening Special 15% off is sweet... Rana L doesn't realizes that I will go for AYCE as long as I get a discount?!   Rolls, Sushi, More hand rolls made me overdosed with rice... carb high... The sushi itself are not bad at all... but as usual for all AYCE restaurants, rice and rice and more rice.  The hot items were disappointing though... most of them were not cooked fresh as they were served lukewarm.... Tempura Shrimps that have been under a heated lamp for awhile are not good. Most of the dishes were drowned in this teriyaki like starchy sauce.... that's definitely not Japanese.  But if you are like my Yelp Friend thinks highlight of an AYCE is the ice cream, then you won't be disappointed. 6 different ones to choose from, or just ask them to bring you 2 of each??  Services here was fast, efficient, indifferent.... We got food that we didn't order and everything we ordered fast.   Black Sesame Ice Cream.... Black Sesame Ice Cream.....Black Sesame Ice Cream........"}
