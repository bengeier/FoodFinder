{"text":"I can only comment on the breakfast because, so far, that's all I've had.  But, we went twice this past week!  We had a different server each time and both of them were very friendly and attentive.  Food came out both times very quickly.  This will be our go-to place now for breakfast.  More food and half the price of Bob Evans (our usual place).  $4.99 got me 3 eggs cooked perfectly medium, home fries, bacon (more than a couple of pieces), and toast.  Servings were very large!  Breakfast is available all day."}
{"text":"The food is quite good ,they always give you your money's worth ,the staff is always friendly to you , some times they can get a bit over rush when they are short staff but they do their best to treat you like you are special"}
{"text":"Best falafel in town
Hummus & Baba ganoch were okay but can be better with less garlic
Tabouleh was old and definitely not freshly made as it should be
We also got lamp pita sandwich and meat shawarma pita sandwich which both were good but we asked to take back and warm/toast the bread
Good place to eat if you are just looking for a neighborhood diner with middle eastern choices on the menu"}
{"text":"Will never go back. Stopped in at 8:15 pm. Asked if it was okay to eat, waitresses said yes, they close at 9 pm. I ordered something easy, grilled cheese and soup. My date ordered Spinach salad, waitress said they didn't have it because spinach spoiled all the time before they could use it. Date ordered Caesar salad. Soup was served cold, waitress ignored us talking on cell phone in kitchen, could see her though doors with cell phone to her ear. 8:50 waitress told us we had to pay bill and leave. Paid bill, waitress again told us to leave, and if we didn't she would call the police on us. We didn't cause any trouble, were quite and she threatened to call the police to throw us out. Who does that?  I will continue to tell people to never go there, never."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner again tonight. He had he same Mediterranean combo as last time and said it was cooked even better. I had the roast beef dinner with mashed potatoes and gravy. The beef to our surprise was thin slices, like what would be used for sandwiches, but after adding some salt and pepper it was pretty good. The serving was quite large. The potatoes and gravy were not note worthy, but weren't bad either. Overall a better dinner than our last time."}
{"text":"Friendly service, great food and large portions at good prices. Their soups are especially excellent. We enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Grecian stuffed potato pancakes are INCREDIBLE!   And my wife thought the sweet & salty waffle was very good, also."}
{"text":"Love their breakfasts, but DO NOT go for all you can eat wings.  They were undercooked to the point that I ate 2 and sent the plate back.  She brought out another plate but they were still red inside and in total I could only stomach 4 wings for the all you can eat price; I was very polite about it, but the waitress seemed to be in a bad mood and didn't seem to even consider taking it off my bill.  Shouldn't have even eaten that many - nauseous all night."}
{"text":"So first off,  I saw a comment about how huge their sides of bacon are.  This is no joke.  That's a lot of bacon. 

The servers were super nice and the breakfast was fantastic,  service was fast,  too. 

I've lived in the falls for a few months now,  and hadn't gotten around to trying the place until today, because on the outside of doesn't look the best. Well,  looks can be deceiving. It's nice and clean and spacious inside. 

I will be returning soon to try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"A nice addition to the area . A family owned place with an incredible choice of options on their menu.
I have tried their breakfast and it was perfect , tonight I tried their stir fry and they aced it !!! Friendly staff , if the 4 page menu overwhelms you ask your server I heard them offer suggestions to many of the patrons there were there when I was. 
Worth looking into if you want a good meal at a reasonable price and do not care to spend your money at a chain."}
{"text":"Cool little comfort food place. Always something on the broad menu to match your mood, and good daily specials. Soup is great, Reubens are yummy, fried cod special is good -- can't miss. Friendly staff and cozy booths, but not fancy. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is great!  Only complaint you get sooo much food - so that's really not a complaint. Our waitress was so friendly. We are just visiting and we might be back tomorrow for breakfast. The menu is vast and there is something for everyone. The sweet and salty waffle was buried in crisp bacon, the stuffed potato pancake was amazing, and the eggs with gyro meat was also great. I didn't eat everything but luckily I got to taste the things others ordered. 

I just wish they had real maple syrup as a choice. 

We will be back when we're in town"}
{"text":"Not too bad, this place is okay. I usually get the chicken cordon blue I've had some of their Mediterranean stuff. Pretty good too, service is pretty good. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Absolutely worst experience. Went in for breakfast was kinda busy. Hostess /server? Greets us looks like she just got out of bed without showering or anything. Gives response oh u guess I will get you started with drinks
 We sit another 15 minutes at least I have to ask about server she replies oh no one's came back?? I guess I can take your order what do u want?? Really??? Later the original server comes over to apologize once again we don't see anyone again. Food comes out cold ordered side of gravy for 1.99 and was charged for biscuits and gravy not what I ordered 
 Meanwhile it's slow and all servers are just standing around?? No refills offered nothing??? Price value good but doesn't really matter if it's cold and service is awfuk"}
{"text":"I ordered the pot roast and my wife ordered the meatloaf.  The portion sizes were moderate but filling.  The pot roast appeared to be shaved roast beef with gravy.  My wife thought the meatloaf was mediocre.  The staff was friendly and we were seated promptly.  Our waitress was attentive but I just didn't think the food was that memorable."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a late breakfast here today. \"Lylas Breakfast Slam\" at $7.99 was good, especially the potato pancakes, and generous in portion, so that I brought half of it home with me. One complaint would be the lack of handicapped parking...only one spot in front of the restaurant...although the place wasn't at all busy although it was noon. Another would be that although the menu is quite extensive, I think that business would be better if they served wine and/or beer. Also, it might help for them to have a website, so that patrons can check out menu items ahead of time."}
{"text":"when i ate their it was slow yet the service was slow. the food was completely sub par and the whole experience was awful. i had better food at mcdonalds."}
{"text":"Lyla's is right down the street from our house - it's located in the old French Coffee Shop space in Cuyahoga Falls.  I loved the old downtrodden cozy Paris-themed decor of the French Coffee Shop, but the new theme is brighter and somehow colder.  As a fellow reviewer hinted at, it is more suited towards the older breakfast crowd.   

Gone is the carpet, the natural light from the windows, rum/sugar crepes, and liquor license.  Usher in the tile floor, fluorescent lights, white polished ceiling tiles, and nothing stronger to drink than caffeine.  We held no preconceived notions about Lyla's when we had breakfast there last Sunday.  We had read about Lyla's online.

My husband and I - having found ourselves alone on a rare frigid Sunday morning - walked to Lyla's for breakfast.  We were greeted by friendly staff and were seated in a warm,roomy booth.  

The menu was overwhelming!  My husband and I ordered decaf coffees and waters with lemon.  Our server, Renee was friendly and attentive.  Ray had a meat-lover's scrambled egg skillet with sausage gravy over the top (seriously?) and I had scrambled eggs with corned beef hash, a side of ham (not a literal side of ham), and hash browns (sliced fried potatoes).  Our breakfast was delicious and we took much of it home with us.

My biggest concern is the ambitious menu.  This menu is huge (4 pages)!  I'm afraid that a restaurant of this size cannot supply the fresh ingredients that are listed daily based on the location/clientele.  There were senior citizens sitting next to us complaining about the fact that they hadn't received glasses of (free) water on a Sunday morning!  This type of diner sadly doesn't help to pay the bills.

We enjoyed our breakfast at Lyla's and plan to eat dinner there soon!"}
{"text":"Took my mother to lunch today and it was fantastic. We each had a bowl of matzo ball soup and we split a Reuben sandwich. Always looking for a local place and not a chain Service was outstanding and the place was very clean."}
{"text":"Menu was way too large and varied too much, in my opinion. The hummus was really garlicky, too much for me. Falafel seemed frozen with dry herbs. The tahini seemed tart and caught me off guard. I will go back to try something else as I'd love to see this place stay around. I'll be keeping my eye out for recommendations..."}
{"text":"First trip here Tuesday for lunch with a group. Not impressed. That was surprising since I've had their food at catered events. I had the chicken fingers with rice pilaf and brussel sprouts. Rice ok, brussel sprouts I didn't eat. I also had a bowl of chicken noodle soup, DON'T!  It was worst I've had at a restaurant. Chicken fingers harder than usual, but edible. Will I be back? Not in this lifetime."}
{"text":"A nice menu with plenty of vegetarian selections. The falafel sandwich was great! My companion got the veggie stuffed potato pancake, which was awesome!"}
{"text":"So far food has been good and prices aren't too bad. Staff has been great also. Many items on the menu to choose from."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  We haven't had a bad meal there and have been there 4 times.  The chicken fingers appetizers was large and tasty.  The soups are good as well.  I ordered the Corned Beef sandwich and it was piled high with corned beef and very good.  My daughter had the cheeseburger and was good.  My wife had something from the Mediterranean side and said it was very good.  The place is clean and kind of plain, but the food is good.  They take the Belly app also and you can get good coupons from them."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good. Nice small restaurant with a good atmosphere. Potatoes were a little burnt but overall good food"}
{"text":"The food was excellent; everything else was only mediocre.

There seems to have been a lot of excitement over the opening of Lyla's Family Restaurant in Cuyahoga Falls so I figured I should give it a try. Everything about it looks and feels like your average neighborhood diner so I wasn't expecting too much. The differentiating factor about Lyla's is that they identify as a Mediterranean restaurant. 

When I walked in the doors I immediately felt like I was in a diner akin to your typical Denny's or Bob Evans (complete with the bendable straws and jelly packets on every table), but with less character. The décor was very uninspired. It felt a little gloomy and there was no cohesion between the random artwork atop the pastel color scheme on the walls that clashed with the old and bold colored booths and tables.

The service was exactly what one would expect from from a stereotypical diner; depressing. While watching the servers help the various patrons I saw some smiles and helpfulness but I did not notice any excitement from the servers about anything. When I asked my server if there was anything she would recommend, rather than bragging about a couple dishes or telling me about her favorite meal she pointed to the Mediterranean page on the menu and simply told me that a lot of people order from that page.

Now before I arrived I had planned on trying their Mediterranean food so I went ahead and ordered the Mediterranean Appetizer Combo and the Combination Platter so I could get a good feel for their various items. I felt a little like a glutton after she questioned if I really wanted \"Both?\" so I told her I planned on taking half of it home for later.

Both the appetizer and the entrée came out at the same time and it was definitely a lot of food. Their hummus and their baba ganoush were probably the best I have had in this area. They had a lot more flavor and spices in them than at Aladdin's. The pitas were a little hard and the falafel was a little over-fried but overall I enjoyed the Appetizer Combo. 

The Combination Platter was very good as well. The vegetables and all of the meat options were seasoned and cooked perfectly. They did not overcook their lamb like most places so that was a nice bonus. Their rice pilaf was fantastic as well. I do not think their kafta was as good as the other options but it was not bad at all.

I am a little bit torn on my rating. If they had not been so proud of their renovations and updated décor on their Facebook posts, I would not have been so harsh about that aspect. I think I will definitely get food again from here but I will most certainly order it to-go and not eat inside. I give the food 4 stars and the overall combination of the food and experience 3 stars."}
{"text":"We came for lunch; started off with foole as an appetizer, and it tasted... weird? I've eaten a lot of foole. It tasted off. And lava hot, which was a recurring theme in all the food. Microwaved. 

Dining companion's sausage and even pancakes tasted old and reheated, and my potato pancake was pretty inedible. I grew up on garbage diner food so I had low expectations and I was still unhappy. Servers were both very nice and checked up often, but I wasn't gonna be like, \"Yeah, can you change the entire nature of how the business prepares food? Thanks boo.\" 

I still feel bloated."}
{"text":"Visited Lyla's for the first time this evening. It is likely we will be returning.  The food was very good. Portions were big enough that we both have lunch for tomorrow too. :).  Prices were reasonable especially considering the amount of food you receive.  We are hoping a second trip will turn out just as favorable but as for our first... we were pleased."}
