{"text":"Yuuuuuuuum!  Stopped in here one weekend for a late brunch with pals, and I think that it was my favourite brunch experience in Toronto so far. I ordered the benny with spinach, which comes on a HOMEMADE SCONE. Why don't all bennies come on homemade scones? That was the question that I had after eating at Cafe Neon.  Bearnaise  sauce was nice and light, and breakfast came with the option of homefries, salad, or half and half. The homefries were herb-y lemon-y perfection. L-O-V-E-D them.  Brunch portions are on the large side, so come here prepared to eat.   I should also mention that our server was an absolute delight. He was friendly, and helpful, and also hilarious.   PS. If you're a fan, they also have vegetarian baked beans on the menu. Not sure what they're like, but based on everything else that I tried, I'm betting they're top notch."}
{"text":"A bit on the pricy side for what I ordered; got the bagel with smoked tuna & it was the smallest bagel I've ever laid eyes on served with a slice of grapefruit which I didn't eat because, well, still haven't got a taste for that.  I tried eating that bad boy so slowly but ended up hungrier after I ate than before I began eating. Ah well. I liked the decor, the music (Beach House! Radiohead!), and the overall vibe of the place. My friend and I stayed for a while just talking and I didn't feel rushed to leave which is always pleasant."}
{"text":"Are you going to the west end of the city? If you are, you have to check out this lovely coffee shop. The coffee is great, the food is prepared with detail and care. The bathroom is spotless and the atmosphere is great. This is one of my favourite places on the west side. Love it!"}
{"text":"I stopped here about an hour before close to snag a drink with my indie coffee passport. Cafe Neon has a variety of tea and coffee drinks (including a drink that mixes coke and espresso. what!?), break-fasty cocktails, and a selection of brunch dishes like breakfast wraps, yogurt, oatmeal, and bagels. I stuck with a tea, which was fine. The big communal table at the window was a great, well-lit place to relax. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great new place in increasingly gentrified area of town:)  good sandwiches and great coffees...  A bit pricey for what it is ..but is too be expected when a neighbourhood becomes hipsterfied :P  deff reccommend !!"}
{"text":"This is one of my fave's. I work near Cafe Neon & I'm so glad they have excellent food. Their brunch is delicious, the wedges are amazing! The staff are fun & friendly with an attitude that carries Neon. Their Gluten Free Quiche is an excellent choice for anytime of the day."}
{"text":"If I could give them 0 for service and 5 for food, I would. The food was excellent, the service was both surly and inept. The server we had did a huge disservice to the talented chef.  Actual conversation with the waiter: Me: What is butterbean sausage? Him: It is a type of sausage. Me: .... Him: Sausage.  This is not nearly as helpful as he might think it was.  The soup came *after* the main course. Like 10 minutes after, not even together with the main course by any stretch.  The coffee came without a spoon, even after I asked for cream. I was drinking decaf and asked for a refill - and got non-decaf.   I had to ask for a saucer for used tea bags, and then I had to justify asking for it.   Again, excellent food. The potatoes are great, and I absolutely love the salad. When people care that much about the side dishes, you know the mains are top notch. But the service was almost hilariously bad. \"Sausage,\" really?"}
{"text":"UPDATE: I was at Neon for another try for Saturday brunch with friends. The place was packed, but we snagged the last table. It was even noisier than before with the extra crowd.  I had salad nicoise and the soup of the day: butternut squash and sweet potato. Both were excellent. The salad may have had bit too much lettuce and beet greens, but it was nicely dressed. The soup, again, was tasty. Just the thing for a cool winter day.  My friends had more traditional fare: eggs various ways (benedict, over easy, scrambled) with toast (gluten-free toast is available, so Neon got extra points from my boyfriend), salad and home fries. My friends were very impressed with their meals.  Service was even friendlier than before, although slower because of the crowd.  I give them an extra star, although the noise will still generally keep me away.  PREVIOUS REVIEW:  Neon has taken over the space that used to be occupied by the old neighbourhood lunch standby Café Bernate. Neon has updated and brightened the décor (no more vintage kitchen tables and chairs) but the basic layout remains the same: order/coffee counter and small tables up front, larger tables in the back. They've bumped up the sound system so the place is louder than before. Don't expect a relaxing lunch.  I dropped in for lunch this week to check it out for soup and a sandwich. The cream of celery soup with tarragon and olive oil was quite good - tasty, flavourful, with nice bits of still crunchy celery - and the portion was quite sizeable. The chicken club sandwich, however, was disappointing. The only thing that had any flavour was the sweet challah bread. The breaded chicken breast was tasteless and seemed overcooked and I couldn't taste any garlic in the mayo.  Service was friendly and speedy.  I'll give them another try, but between the noise and the spotty food it's not looking like this'll be a new neighbourhood haunt for me right now."}
{"text":"Ordered their quiche. It was alright. A bit cold and needed a little more flavor. Husband got a sandwich and was satisfied but thought it was a small portion. Our guest also got a sandwich and enjoyed it. Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Good food, good coffee and nice space. However,  service abit inconsistent, constant pricing changes and now with more upcharge. Value vs. Quality?"}
{"text":"So delicious. My coworker and I came at around 2:30, there were a few people around. Great vibe and the menu made me happy because of the all day breakfast.  I had the Caesar salad and my coworker enjoyed the Niçoise salad. Both were awesome and came in enormous bowls - filled to the brim!  We also shared a bowl of the frites which were delicious. Fresh and hot, came with rosemary on top and garlic mayo. HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch. One of the best in the city, even. Sat at the bar and enjoyed some salt cod fish cakes and eggs Benedict. The Bernaise sauce comes on the side, which is a great touch if you'd like to not smother your food in it (or if you like to dunk your bacon). Perfect portion size and great coffee. So much positivity! Also, they were playing a lot of Pearl Jam, which I obvioously enjoyed."}
{"text":"Neon is a great little hidden gem. I have been there several times and they have consistently delivered fresh and tasty food. Mind you I do tend to order the same sandwich every time - the chicken waldorf sandwich. Made on a super fresh bun. Crispy on the out and nice and moist inside. The filling is equally as good with a well balanced yet full of flavour chicken salad. For variety I have checked out the side salads which are also great.. The atmosphere is warm and current... Great background music and friendly service..."}
{"text":"Great food and addition to the neighborhood. The food is original and different and the vibe is really down to earth. Will be back over and over!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered the grilled cheese lunch combo which gives you fries for an extra $3. Also ordered a fresh squeezed juice. Sandwich was the size of my hand, finished it in 6 bites. Fries were delicious but no sign of the advertised rosemary and the coleslaw was old and tasted rotten. No one asked me how my lunch was so I didn't bother sharing my opinion, decided to share it here instead. For $20, make your own damn grilled cheese."}
{"text":"I've been to their other location and it was so delicious but out of reach for my normal weekend hanger. I was so thrilled to notice this new location a few weeks ago. I went today and can report that it is as delicious as the original!  I had the smoked trout bagel sandwich. It was delicious as fresh. We shared an order of pancakes and they were massive, fluffy and flavorful! I legitimately do not have a single complaint about this place and I almost always find something to complain about. The coffee was decent and the service was pleasant. I can't wait to go back and I'm so glad they moved into our hood! I'm looking forward to trying all the things!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars  I walked by during my lunch break and saw soup of the day sign. I love soups so I went in to ask what the soup special was. It was a tomato with chick peas and lentils topped off with some sort of sour cream. I didn't wait long and paid $6.25 for a container to go. It came with crustinis if you like to dip some sort of bread into your soup and I thought the soup was delicious! There were crunchy pieces of chick peas and flavourful. I would definetly love to come back and try more"}
{"text":"Food here is a-ok. I only had the fishcakes and sprout salad as they seemed to stand out from mediocre looking brunch options of eggs bennie or breakfast sandwiches. I was not about to go to brunch just to eat an oatmeal cup. That's too healthy.  The fishcakes were a bit bland inside. They weren't dry, but resembled a mix of pressed shredded haddock and salmon with fine, crumb breading on the outside. IMO they could really use some lemon juice, hot sauce or salt. Their service is attentive.  Horrible post-brunch music. It's like the customers deliberately talked louder to overtake the soundtrack. Did anyone get the memo that post-punk and post-hardcore died in 2008? Definitely don't appreciate the 30 seconds from Mars style vocals. Is this that eat-and-gtfo note?"}
{"text":"I come here to do work when before my physiotherapy appointments. I've only had a lattes here and it's good. The people are very nice as well. I like that it doesn't have that typical cafe feel - rather resembles more like a mechanic's garage turned into cafe. Must be the loft like high ceilings and the grey/brick wall interior. Gives it some personality.   When you're not here during the lunch rush, finding a seat is pretty easy."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot on the weekends!   Food is delicious - particularly the home fries. Service is always pleasant. Space is open and bright. You can usually get a table when you arrive, although there is limited seating.  It really is a unique spot and also somewhat secluded location. You will need to plan to come here as it's a bit out of the way."}
{"text":"Extremely long wait time. Came here on a Thursday lunch and the place is half empty but the line up is to the door. The employee told me the food is usually prepared quickly so I decided to stay for lunch. The line up to pay and order was 20 minutes. It took another 15 minutes of standing there with the receipt in my hand until I got my takeout. There was only 2 employees working inside.   If you're thinking to come here for lunch, keep in mind that it will take minimum 30-35 minutes before you can get your food.   Probably won't come back again. The food is not even worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Appallingly horrible. $25 for a sandwich that takes 45 minutes to come out, and then disintegrates mid-pickup from the unbelievable amount of mayo slathered all over. I really can't understand how someone can care this little about their service and food. I go in a few times a week for coffee, and every single time I walk in, they act like they've never seen me before. This is how they treat a regular, so if you're just another customer, I can guarantee they won't give a shit about you."}
{"text":"Love this place. A bit pricey for the food they serve but wifi is good, coffee is great and vibes are chill with awesome art."}
{"text":"Food was better than I was expecting. Ordered a chicken club sandwich on one occasion and it was delicious and the tropical oatmeal on another which was fine for $4.00. A great spot if you just need something casual to tie you over or are looking to grab a quick bite with friends."}
{"text":"This is our second day in a row coming for breakfast. Finally a morning restaurant that opens before the rest of Queen street!   I like the service (but hard to say what it's like when it gets busy).   The music is upbeat and not too loud.  I love the back room area. The decor is clean and well designed. More spacious than it looks at the front.   We ordered oatmeal with goji and almonds. It was a little heavy off the milk (you can get reg. or almond) so I'll be sure to ask for less milk (personal preference). But our son enjoyed it thoroughly."}
{"text":"Went in here the other day in search of a coffee and muffin but was pleasantly surprised when I found out they served sit down meals as well. Brunch time yas!  First off- This place is so aesthetically pleasing. From the menus to the art on the wall- it's all just so pretty! I ended up getting the breakfast wrap and \" brunchifying\" my meal. Pretty much you're just adding salad and home fries to your breakfast sammy but it's totally worth it if you're hungry.   I can for sure see my self coming here a lot , especially in the summer. Must go back to try their lunch menu out!"}
{"text":"This is a somewhat interesting area for a cafe as there isn't much else here other than some offices.  I had the cortado as part of the Indie Coffee passport (ICP) as they didn't have the Cappuccino. My friend went for a latte here is the verdict My friend had a chai latte and commented it was quite good.  Espresso: Medium Crema': Decent Milk: Frothed well with nice microfoam. Latte Art: decent. I would say check out this place if you are in the area. Their food items look interesting so are worth a look. I ordered a macaroon. The macaroon was so chewy I think I hurt my jaw (inherent problem when this dessert is made a full size) 3 Stars for the espresso drinks."}
{"text":"Yeah, this place works. Like the neighbourhood and post-industrial vibe. Great brunch, simple, fresh ingredients and good coffee. Eggs were fresh and we'll prepared, pancakes nice and fluffy. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"There's a roomy and bright dining room at the back. I had lunch here with a friend on a Thursday. Service was friendly and prompt, and the food arrived quickly. They weren't too busy and they let my friend and I stay and chat.   I had the veggie quiche which was quite small, it came with arugala. I added the lunch combo #1 - $3 for rosemary fries; they came with a mayo based dip and were on the salty side but tasty. My friend got the chickpea salad and rosemary fries (not counted as combo-able)."}
{"text":"Really tasty brunch and great drinks! Got the fish cakes and poached eggs and a side of potatoes. So delicious!  The potatoes are herbed and have a citrus taste to them- super crispy as well. Definitely worth getting and the fish cake was made of trout- truly unique flavour.   My table mates got the Benedict and pancakes. Both were also super tasty- the pancakes came with bacon and the Benedict cake on a scone, super good.   If you're in the area and want brunch, do recommend."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere here. I love the wall art which is by a local artist. The space is quite big for queen street and is a variety of booths in the bar to sit at by the coffee bar. Very good ALL day breakfast selection. All breads and biscuits are made in house ! And the prices are great. Duely note it is cash only right now but the debit machine is coming soon! Lovely staff who are are very friendly snd welcoming who make u feel like an automatic regular. There's choices of big tables of your coming with a group or side tables of your coming with a friend or so. It has a very homey vibe- I can see this becoming my regular break my spot fast. Speciality coffee drinks here are quality and great prices. Side note- I really like the music playlist they have here.. Super mellow and fun- all round great breakfast experience. Plus u can come come all day for it since they're open till 8pm serving it! Shout out to the chicken sausage it os DEELICIOUS and I really like the salad dressing they use its fresh and flavourful."}
{"text":"I LOVE Cafe Neon! I'm from Texas but make a point to visit at least once each visit to Toronto. The drinks are good, but the real appeal is the food. It's an extra $4.75 to \"brunchify\" a breakfast sandwich and get fresh greens and DELICIOUS breakfast potatoes - probably the best breakfast/brunch side I've ever had anywhere, ever - and it's well worth it. I'll keep coming back until those Rosemary potatoes are taken off the menu. Yum!"}
{"text":"Great little cafe in an upcoming neighborhood. Great coffee, tea, salads and soup. A bit on the pricey side with the food for what you get, but the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. Kind of makes up for it."}
{"text":"Cafe Neon, is probably one of the busiest coffee shops around the Bloor/Lansdowne area.  I often come here for a simple Americano or Coffee, and the beans they use are high end.  I have also purchased food here a few times and their sandwiches are great, although on the pricey side compared to other places around the area.  The vibe and decor inside of very interesting and it has a nice coffee house vibe inside.  There are always plenty of seats available, so there is no need to scramble to get out of there like a Starbucks or other busy mainstream coffee shops.  Staff is fairly friendly and I have had catered food from here and the catering staff are very polite and knowledgeable about the food they are serving.  The catering food is also great, considering the quantity of food they must make sometimes.  The ingredients are usually fresh and healthy as well.  Overall a great local coffee shop around an area that typically doesn't get these kinds of establishments.  I have yet to try everything on the drink menu, but I have my eye on the Devil's Nectar next!  I always drop by for a quick Coffee when I have the time, and I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"3.5 - I've been here about 5 times now. The location is great, and the reno to the space is amazing. Love the big back room. The service is really good too. The food is FINE, but I find the meals very inconsistent. One day you'll get a great full plate, the next day the chicken sausage is dry and thin or the home fries feel like they've been re-cooked a few times. Se I'd say the lunch is better than the breakfast in taste and value."}
{"text":"So good! Came here on a whim with my mom for a pre Mother's Day brunch and definitely was not disappointed. I had the Eggs Benny with pulled pork - amazing (the dressing on the salad was bomb). Mom had the Pancakes with Bacon - also amazing. Both dishes were good portions and tasted super fresh. We sat in a communal bench table area which wasn't bad since we aren't really picky with seating  (Suggestion: come a bit earlier than you normally would to get seating you want or expect to wait as the seating area is not huge & filled up quickly). A lady beside us had one of their lunch bowls and it looked so yummy. Definitely getting that next time I'm at Cafe Neon since I definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"I love cafe neon :) place is nice and quiet, service is great, coffee is delicious, and everything I have ordered tastes great. Will definitely become a recurring client."}
{"text":"Wonderful little place. Had a great brunch, so delicious, fresh and homemade. Quick service and very friendly staff. The coffee was good. I loved the atmosphere and glad I stumbled on this gem!"}
{"text":"2.5 Stars.  As some have mentioned already this is a very interesting place to have a cafe, but I love it. Off the beaten path and doing well. This means they are offering something for the clientele here.  The vibe is as expected, artsy with great music. They have some live plants which add something nice I think. The coffee was maybe just a bit above average. It could even be the vibe in here made my latte better than it could have been.  Filled with people with MACs and mothers chatting, it seems as though it is a place attracting all people from the neighborhood, which I can really appreciate.  The only knock against the place, and one I have talked about before after going to some other places, is what do you want to be known for? Coffee? Food? Alcohol? There is a lot going on here and it doesn't seem to have an identity. I know I could be way off and I accept it if I am, but this is what I noticed.  I would say its worth a visit because it is alright, but I have been to better cafés out there.  That's it!"}
{"text":"quaint.  delicious.  affordable.    That about says it all.  Nothing glamorous or extraordinary here, just great coffee and good food.  It was rather funny that our coffee was served in Starbucks cup."}
{"text":"Best place for a good cup of coffe! The food is exceptionel! Friendly staff generus portion! No wonder why i go there all the time :)  Love everything about this place!"}
{"text":"Come here all the time! Great coffee and a cozy neighborhood spot for brunch and lunch. The Neon breakfast and Niçoise salad are my go too dishes. They play great music here and have incredibly friendly and caring staff."}
{"text":"Just popped in for a meeting and grabbed two croissants and Vanilla tea.   Pros: Large, bright space with ample seating. Free wifi.   Cons: Kitchen closes at 3. They are open until 5. No biggie except they still sell food until close with no way to warm it up... A toaster oven or even microwave would be an excellent investment.   2 croissants and tea came in around $9. They take credit and cash.   Plain croissant was pretty tasty, all the food in the display looked fresh and tasty. Chocolate croissant was a disappointment. The vanilla tea is DELICIOUS.   Girl behind the counter was checking her phone as I was asking questions/ordering - big no no!"}
{"text":"I have been a long time customer at Cafe Neon. The food is always delicious! I also find that the staff are friendly!  I also like that Cafe Neon is kid friendly. I am always happy to take my 3 year old and 1 year old there for a treat or brunch!"}
{"text":"A Friend of mine recommended we go here for brunch while I was visiting her end of town.  SO Glad we did.  For those that find themselves on Toronto's west end, this is definitely a place you'll want to try.  I had a really hard time deciding what to get, Im a sucker for poached eggs so I got the simple breakfast, wish sausage, toast, potatoes. it was so good. so much flavour, and different from the usual greesy spoon breakfast plate. My friend had the french toast special with apple butter. It was Amazing. Really great quality food, with a lot of thought put into the menu.  I was tempted to buy a bottle of their own signature olive oil. Next time!   Other points for cafe neon: great atmosphere (music, decor, bright beautiful light pouring in the windows)  free wifi, Almond milk as an option for your coffee. Its truly a little hidden Gem."}
{"text":"Decent place for brunch. Got the sausage sandwich ($6) and brunchied it, i.e. side of salad and home fries (+$4.25).   I liked how the sausage sandwich came in an onion bun. That was a nice touch. Added a bunch of hot sauce to the sandwich. Fries were crispy on out and soft inside.  I wouldn't say the food here blew me away, but it was good nonetheless!"}
{"text":"The pulled pork sandwich is amazing and believe it or not the House salad with their special vinaigrette is... awesome!  Hillary is absolutely an amazing waitress! Wonderful customer service and has just a warm spirit!"}
{"text":"This place gets a 4 automatically from just walking in! I love the atmosphere and the art decor. It reminds me of my university cafe. The food was simple and delicious. I recommend this place for sure! I got the pancakes, a bagel with an egg, and bacon. The bagels are really soft which I love!!! I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Lovely brunch. Above average food, I had the chicken sausage breakfast sandwich with greens and roasted potatoes. My bf had the quiche Lorraine and fish cakes with Bernaise. We split each.  The service is happy, helpful and a pleasure to interact with.  The breakfast sandwich was absolutely one of the best ones I've had. A croissant like bun, slightly more dense, a sharp aged cheddar, the whole thing just melts in your mouth. Roasted potatoes are not my thing and I didn't want these to end! So savory and light. The bfs quiche was light, flakey crust and just set. The flavoring was rich and gentle. Excellent and varied tea and coffee selection. This is a absolute must try brunch spot.  The fish cakes are very subtle."}
{"text":"Originally thought this place was a computer store because of their minimalistic signage.   Really delicious sandwiches, my favourite is the Mediterranean tuna. But I like going there best for their healthy breakfast options- granola on  greek yogurt, bagels, OJ like my mom used to make, and the best thing ever- a bowl of steaming hot oatmeal with cardamom and raisins. It's cozy and I feel like I'm right at home. Lot of seating in the back, contrary to what you see when you walk right in. I haven't tried their espresso yet but I have hear it is decent as well!"}
{"text":"Not bad! We stopped by for a Saturday breakfast around 9:30 AM and found it pretty empty (although it did pick up by the time we left around 11:00 AM). Overall, pretty good - not excellent, but good enough that you wouldn't regret stopping by if you're in the area. The food *looks* great, tastes decent, and the vibe is super relaxed (think industrial yet chic with a hint of cozy). There were definitely several group brunch dates going on the morning we visited - so it's a good casual spot to meet up with friends, and with the space to accommodate it.  We ordered the a) Eggs Benny (poached eggs with smoked pulled pork on a scone with salad and home fries ($15), b) Stacked Pancakes with Bacon ($13), c) a coffee and a tea. The flavours were fine, but the textures were a little off to us (i.e. the pancakes weren't very fluffy), but the eggs benny was decent, and the greens were nice and fresh. Overall - the food is alright. Nothing overly special, but tastes good enough to warrant a second visit!  With tax and tip, we paid a little over $45. There is free street parking in the area, and they also have a variety of drinks and pastries available."}
{"text":"I was in the office building across the street when the fire bell began to ring and we all had to stand outside. It was pretty sunny this afternoon and I didn't have my shades or a hat so decided to find shelter indoors. When I turned around, I found Cafe Neon !  My first impression of this place was that it was really, really cute. The food and aroma of the coffee were so nice. I bought myself an iced latte (strong and perfect for a day when you're tired) and marshmallow bar (with brown sugar and salt - amaaazing). The sandwiches and pizza of the day looked delicious; unfortunately, I wasn't hungry so I didn't buy lunch here. I wouldn't travel for coffee, but would love to check out the brunch and lunch here.  Good for: getting work done, your hit of java, lunch"}
{"text":"Love this place. Egg sandwich unusual. Sliced egg on bread that tastes like something! Beautiful garnishes. Strong coffee. Ginger muffin crunchy on top, choc chai muffin really good. Habitually late as I am, I make a point of getting to physio early so I can have lunch or a snack at Cafe Neon."}
{"text":"TLDR; average breakfast, decent service, expensive price tag. Would not return.  We came here for breakfast yesterday. My first impression is that the menu is terribly confusing. There are identical items listed in different places with different names, optional add-ins for items on separate pages, etc.   The food was mediocre. We both ordered the standard breakfast (2 eggs, turkey sausage, potatoes, toast, salad). Eggs were cooked fine, turkey sausage had too much rosemary, potatoes were average, salad greens had slimy/mushy bits, toast was toast..  Boyfriend payed $4 for fresh orange juice that tasted like it was from concentrate.   Overall, our breakfast was $40 which I thought was incredibly expensive for the quality."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a lunch with my fiance during a weekday.  Bae opted for their fried chicken sandwich and I ordered their breakfast, food was very good.  Have to agree with the other reviewers that the service was super super slow. Would not recommend coming here if you are in a rush at all.  Coffees were also good, just wished our server was a bit more attentive.  Pro tip : if you want to get out of here a bit faster, pay with cash. If you are using a card, you have to line up at the cash to pay your bill."}
{"text":"Dropped into Cafe Neon for a quick bite after a 'gallery run' on Queen West. I had the Winter bowl salad - a mix of arugula, beets, chickpeas, humus and other stuff. It was delicious and not over 'dressed' in oil like some places. We split an order of rosemary fries. Nice flavour though I would have liked it a bit more 'crispy'.   Service friendly, establishment clean. Menu is reasonably priced as is the portions. Worth a try when you're in the area.   A solid 3 1/2 stars, maybe 4 if it maintains consistency over time."}
{"text":"Ate lunch here today, surprisingly big menu, tons of vegan and gluten-free options. People who think it's pricey must not be used to eating vegan and/or gluten-free food at cafes because I thought the prices were super affordable and the food was more than worth it. I had the super bowl salad with goat cheese and it was $14.50 for so much food!"}
{"text":"Came here specifically for my coffee for the ICP. Gotta say I probably would not have found this place if not for the ICP.  But people in this neighbourhood must know this gem cause there was plenty of people inside enjoying their brunch.  On first arrival and going on, I was thrilled to see the decor. It felt like my kind of place. I ordered a Cappuccino which on it's own was at a good hot temperature, good espresso flavor but was a bit small actually.  I love the way they used this space and from the pictures I think it would be great for brunch. Thus I only came for the coffee and didn't have a chance to stay. This place I think could be a 4star for me, just gotta get me back for brunch!"}
{"text":"This little cafe is a little off the beaten path in an unexpected office/industrial building. The coffee is good, brunch and salads are great and the atmosphere is very chill. Many of us from the local area want neon Cafe to be successful but worry about it being discovered by the masses   A couple of my favourite items include the eggs Benny and chicken patties as a side.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I wish Cafe Neon was a little closer, I'd make many frequent trips here.   Though they only accept cash, the free wifi and decent hours are a catch. The espresso drinks are around $4 and extra for almond milk, soy milk, etc. and I was really pleased to see almond milk on the menu. Though the drinks are slightly more expensive than the average, they're fresh, strong and well worth it.   I ordered a breakfast sandwich (Neon, $6.75 with Spinach, tomato, mozarella, bacon, egg in a flatbread bun) and it came with a few blueberries on the side, all of which were crisp and fresh. I feel the hatred for mushy blueberries, and it doesn't go unwarranted.   The service is great and and the overall ambiance is very relaxing and welcoming.  There are about 10 tables of two and a huge communal table at back with plenty of outlets. This cafe is definitely work and laptop-friendly."}
{"text":"I love this cafe for brunch on the weekends!  They have a good selection of breakfast staples.  The pancakes are great!  Coffee and teas are on point as well. One of the most surprising things is how great their pastries are! The croissants are delicious, as good if not better than Nadège.  Staff is friendly and quick.  Lots of seating in the back."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and had eggs benny and omelette. The food was decent and the prices were good. Great atmosphere and very friendly staff. I wouldn't come out of the way to eat here but if you want a decent brunch place in the neighbourhood, it's definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Great little brunch spot in my neighbourhood. It's a little off the beaten path (west of Lansdowne on Wallace) so you sort of have to know about it to track it down. It always seems to be nice and sunny, thanks to a giant front window. It's busy but not noisy. The staff are nice and pleasant.  Food is the usual brunch fare like eggs, sausage, omelettes, with lots of specials. Sometimes the food is amazing, and sometimes it's just good. But it's certainly never bad and always satisfies my early-day hunger pains.  Coffee is bottomless, which should be standard for all places, but certainly something I like for the morning. And you can even get one last cup to go if you need to jet. Lots of desserts if you want to take it up a notch, and they have booze for later in the day.  Really like the atmosphere: clean and simple. Such a nice spot. Definitely recommended for any day of the week, but they close at 5pm on weekdays."}
{"text":"Cafe Neon  Yet another spot on my list I finally got to. On the perfect sunny Sunday too.   There's a large seating space in the back so don't be fooled by the mini area in the front.  The menu for brunch is pretty standard: a big breakfast, omelettes and bennies. I opted for the standard breakfast with chicken sausage. I always worry about ordering sausages because you know that can be so hit and miss. This was surprisingly delicious and not what I expected. Definitely in house or at least not the norm.  The customer service is a little all over the place. I wasn't sure at one point where our server had gone.  Food is solid!"}
{"text":"My friends and I were seated promptly, although we were lucky to have just missed the lunch rush when more people started piling in and a line quickly formed.  For drink, I had the London Fog, which was absolutely delicious. However, I ordered the Winter bowl, which consisted of chickpeas, hummus, wheatberries, kale, raisins, among many other things. It wasn't very good, and the bottom of the bowl got quite dry as it lacked dressing. I was in fact quite disappointed with the bowl overall."}
{"text":"I just walked in for saturday brunch. The cafe was Very nice. Great food quality, nice and friendly staff. I will definitely come back next time."}
{"text":"Good, tasty food. It's just a pity that each time I have eaten here, the staff give off such a blasé vibe, acting like they could care less about having your business. I don't care if this is Toronto. How about- \"Hi. How are you? Thanks for coming.\""}
{"text":"I loved the variety of the menu. The space is interesting, modern and comfortable. The prices were perfectly reasonable!"}
{"text":"Good food, limited/tight seating, mediocre service, a bit overpriced.  Would order the egg salad sandwich again, although not aesthetically attractive/easy to eat, the taste was a great combination"}
{"text":"Cafe and restaurant serving very good breakfast and brunch on the border of Bloordale and the Junction Triangle. Tucked away across from Ubisoft Toronto and a storage facility, part of a strip of new-ish businesses in a repurposed brick industrial building. An array of well salted and well priced breakfast sandwiches, equally compelling at the table and packed up for take-out. Enormously better for brunch than the Starving Artist around the corner on Lansdowne -- better food and coffee, no marauding wasps and a less hectic atmosphere. Everything we have eaten there has been really good if not stand-out excellent. A sure bet."}
{"text":"I often go here for brunch and if I wanna do some work on my laptop. There are two main areas: the front is nice and bright but limited seating, and the back is where most people stay. The food is good, especially the croissants! Some of the best in the city! Food is a little pricy but portions are fair sized. The area is great and there's a lot to do!"}
{"text":"Holy moly they weren't kidding about the burger! Go for that and the rosemary frites (with a chocolate chip cookie to go!)  *half burger pictured, as we split my usual tuna salad :)"}
{"text":"Well this is my third try so i guess it's fair to pass judgement at this point.  They claim to have breakfast until noon but i've never managed to get breakfast after 11:30 a.m. They don't have lactose free milk but they do have almond and soy milk.  Strange.  Watch out for the breakfast sandwich that bears their name if you don't like your bacon and greasy and soft and limp.  The salads are amazing.   Friendliness of the staff will vary depending on how early in the morning it is so be prepared for a bit of grumpy service at times."}
{"text":"Café Neon is literally right in front of my office soo i admit it, I go almost every day. I love the coffee (there's no Starbucks around) and the quiches. The crust is actually made of Quinoa sooo that means extra protein.  My ultimate fav is the nicoise! A little pricey but great food."}
{"text":"Gord and I had brunch at Cafe Neon, in our 'hood.  Our neighbours said it was good so we thought we'd check it out.  I thought it was just a coffee shop but if you go down the long hallway, there's lots more seating area.  Gord ordered Eggs Benny with the Ontario rainbow trout.  He said it was good but he wasn't crazy about the scone.  I tried a couple of his potatoes and they were good!  Unfortunately Gord liked them too and didn't leave any behind (as he usually does).  I ordered the Stacked Pancakes (I like pancakes but rarely have them).  The meal was good and I'd get it again.  I'd never tried real Greek yoghurt before and I was surprised at how firm it was.  I discovered I wasn't all that fussy for it so would ask them to hold it next time.  The servers were friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Went to this spot for brunch the morning before leaving Toronto as a tourist. I wish I had found it sooner! The prislces were reasonable and the staff was friendly- best of all, the food was good! Nothing out of the ordinary on their menu, I really liked the chicken sausage."}
{"text":"A cute and trendy cafe with friendly service. It looks tiny at first but there is plenty of seating in the back. They did not have any vegan options, so I ordered the vegetarian breakfast wrap. When the food arrived it was so hot I couldn't eat for about ten minutes. It looked like the wrap was pre made and then microwaved right before serving. The wrap also tasted quite bland and I wasn't very impressed. I wish I had ordered a different item since the bagel sandwiches looked really good (which my friends had)."}
{"text":"Nice little cafe on queen west and Ossington. Ordered the burger and soup of the day. Burger was good, although on the small side. Soup was a potato mush soup, which is like someone took mash potatoes, and liquidfy it. It was quite bland, and need way more salt and seasoning. Overall no too impressed."}
{"text":"Service: when we came in, one of the staff told us to go to the back for dining area. We got seated, but nobody came nor gave us the menu for a short while, so I had to grab the menu from an empty table near us. Other than that, service was friendly and good after that point.  Food: we ordered the Eggs Benny, and Neon Breakfast  Eggs Benny - Eggs Benny with pulled pork came with a side of salad and home fries, everything in the dish was good, but nothing amazing  Neon Breakfast- I asked for my eggs poached hard (don't judge me), and the choice of baked beans. However, my eggs came poached soft (maybe they forgot, OR the chef just didn't allow my savage choice lol), and the baked beans was very blend, with a lot of excess oil :(... should have gotten the bacon.  Overall: it's a cute place for coffee and breakfast, but can't say much for the taste of food"}
{"text":"Adorable cafe with great atmosphere and a good vibe. Coffee was great - they have both drip and espresso based drinks. A good assortment of teas and other beverages. Lovely treats, including a vegan and sugar free earl grey oat bar (YES!!!). they serve breakfast and lunch and the menu has sandwiches, salads, quiche etc. Lots of sitting room, a large window for people watching a really sweet staff! What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"It's easy to miss Cafe Neon given it's understated store front, but you shouldn't! And you'll be forgiven to think it is just a coffee shop when you walk in, but the secret here is that it is actually a great brunch spot with a decent amount of seats at the back that are not visible when you walk in.  I really appreciate the fact that the restaurant do a lot of stuff in-house, such as the greek yogurt, and the smoked trout that is used in the fish cakes and in the smoked trout eggs benny. The blueberry buttermilk pakcakes though, are definitely my favorite.  I find the pricing reasonable given the quality of the food. The lattes could benefit if it were made just a tad stronger, but it could just be my taste."}
{"text":"The cafe is bright and roomy, with simple and artsy decor.  I've had their catering food a few times, it's delicious but quite pricy for the small portion.  I've tried the matcha latte at the cafe, and it was a bit watery.  Would like to come back to try their brunch some other time."}
{"text":"This restaurant was in the neighborhood where we stayed while visiting Toronto.  We arrived around noon on a Saturday and told there was a 20 minute wait.  We sat down and flipped through magazines.  We noticed about 6 people left and 2 went in ahead of us and we were quite surprised to see about 6 or so empty tables.  It took forever to order our food.  It took forever for it to arrive at the table.  It took forever for us to get our check.  I hope they were short staffed on that day. Otherwise they don't know what they are doing.  The food was fine."}
{"text":"Casual hipster vibes at this cafe. Offered various standard brunch options but nothing spectacular. Service was friendly, however."}
{"text":"Great place to have brunch and great location as well! Pretty good service. Lastly, the food was delish! Go for the Eggs Benny ... even better with spinach and trout. Nothing negative to say. Just a happy costumer :)"}
{"text":"Cafe Neon is a cafe in Wallace Emerson that has a fun and urban vibe. I am a complete sucker for pretty interiors and something about Cafe Neon captures my attention. They provide breakfast during the weekdays and brunch on the weekends. Their sandwiches are made in-house with vegan options available. One of their specialty drinks is the Devil's Nectar, which contains two espresso shots and Coca-Cola! Not exactly sure how that would taste but it sounds pretty crazy!  The employees told me that they have a great work culture at Cafe Neon. They are always asked for their input when the cafe wants to launch new food items or what sort of changes should be made. One of their barista is an artist who draws out all the menu boards. Another barista is a wedding photographer! Honestly, he has some of the most gorgeous wedding photography in Toronto I have seen. You can check his site out at: www.nivshon.com. Trust me, you want to click it. I wished I am getting married so I can get some photos done!  Cafe Neon is simply a cute place that I recommend checking out if you are in the area for coffee or brunch."}
{"text":"My friends and I walked here because it was the closest restaurant, and we're so glad we did. The food is good, and our server Hillary was amazing. Made these Jersey girls feel like we were home. The burger and pulled pork sandwich are"}
{"text":"3.5 stars ... solid lunch and lots of decent items at reasonable prices.    Cafe Neon is popular... even on a weekday lunch, you can find this spot quite filled up and on a weekend, I've been told that the wait is easily 30+ minutes. Though it is not a big spot, you can find a table of 4 still works in the back.  Another plus of this spot is that the front does coffees to go... I didnt give it a shot (I had a great flat white further west at Major Treat), it's a spot I can try out next time.  Most of the seating is behind in another room and the coffee take out area is in front.  I got lucky and was seated quickly in a super cozy spot.  I think most people would not like it as it was just stool seating in the front window.  For me, it works as I got to dog and people watch while eating my lunch.  The place is really low key and casual... its not hipsterish but I could easily see other people suggest it is.  I would say it's more of a casual local and low key spot.  The service here is a bit ... scattered and not because they didnt care but because all tables were super filled and they were trying to move the tables quickly.  They're nice but just really busy.  We got our order in but we did wait a bit long seeing how we ordered the vegetarian seasonal salad bowl and a soup & sandwich.  I would say the kitchen was probably just trying to push so many orders out.  Seasonal Bowl (Vegetarian) - I saw another person said this was flavourless so I was worried ordering this.  I think my bowl was far better than theirs then.  Mine was nicely dressed with a light vinaigrette and there was a ton of variety of vegetables.  Sprouted grains, rocket, green sprouts, beets, kale, sweet potato, almonds ... the list goes on.  It was a BIG and brightly coloured salad... Loved the variety and did I say it was BIG?  HUGE.  Great portion for the costs... one of the better ones for this side of Toronto.  Did I like it more than Veghed or The Goods which is nearby?  No... not quite.  It was just missing a flavour wow compared to the other 2.  THOUGH I would have no problems ordering this any time.  3.5/5  Pulled Pork Sandwich - This one was far more smokier than I was expecting out of a little cafe... and that's not a bad thing.  It was tender pork that had a good smokey flavour.  How do they do it without a smoker?  I dunno but it was a good sandwich especially with the onion bread, chipotle mayo, slaw, and coffee bbq sauce.  The sandwich bun seemed a bit smaller but it's under $10.  Can't really complain for Toronto.   4/5  Mushroom Soup - A really nice bowl who's flavour looks far better than looks. It looks more like a murkish grey puddle. With a lot of chopped mushrooms in it, it was very savoury and had tons of bold flavour.  I felt the chef probably was heavy handed with the black pepper so it was probably a bit too much spice to it than I would have liked.  Still an enjoyable soup.  3.5/5  Overall, this is a great spot to try if you're in the area and looking for a solid and affordable meal.  There's a decent amount of options for vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores so you can always find something.  Just be a bit patient for the food and all would be fine."}
{"text":"Decent coffee and the staff are fun. Food is pretty good but soups are a bit hit and miss. The chicken club sandwich is great as is the kale salad. Neon makes a mean croissant and I am super picky - flaky and buttery very good! Service can be a bit slow so have patience."}
{"text":"So lucky to live nearby! Every Sunday would take a stroll before I start my errands for their Americano!"}
{"text":"The sausage sandwich is the big bomb. Great service, great coffee. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Had such good food and service that we came back every morning of our trip.  Food was great, had a pulled pork  sandwich with an onion bun and a burger with bacon which I thoroughly enjoyed. What really brought us back though was Hillary. She has a very warm genuine demeanor and personality. If we had a issue it was resolved and within minutes.  Hillary made us feel very welcome and at home and by the second day we felt like regulars. Will definitely  stop by next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"I stopped into Cafe Neon yesterday for lunch with a friend. On break from her job nearby, she picked this place knowing it was quick and tasty. And I have to agree.   We grabbed a booth in the back room, were poured water, ordered, and received our food in under 15 mins. She had a falafel wrap and I had their winter bowl. I can't even remember all of the things that came stuffed into this massive bowl but let me try: kale, quinoa, raisins, jicama carrot slaw, sweet potato, chick peas, pea shoots, hummus, beets...and I added goat cheese because goat cheese makes almost everything better. It was delicious but I could not finish it all so got it boxed up for a snack later.   The space itself is lovely. They have this tropical, kind of high contrast, hyper pigmented wall art, which is complemented well by the light coloured wood benches and chairs and the translucent back wall. It makes our visit feel pretty chill especially since, if I recall correctly, no music was playing. If there was, I didn't notice it. This is probably my one complaint. I always like a soundtrack to my dining experience and I left sort of craving some tropical house or yacht rock."}
{"text":"Great food! Would give 6 stars if I could but the chairs are a bit uncomfortable. Great drinks, service, and the breakfast and brunch is fantastic. Brunchify all your meals!!"}
{"text":"A cozy cute place to eat a quick bite! My friend and I were here for a quick lunch and we were the only ones in the cafe. They have unique and healthy options. Service was pretty slow on a weekday afternoon. Food was filling and tasty! If you want a quick bite but nothing expensive, this is a good place to go! They have quick take out in the front of the cafe, and dining seating at the back!"}
{"text":"My friends are troopers. We had brunch plans last Saturday, and they were going to bed as I was waking up... and they still got it together to meet their preggo friend for bacon by noon. Tip of the tiny hat to my buddies.   To make their hungover lives easier, we picked a brunch spot up in the Junction near their respective homes, and I'm sure glad we did. Cafe Neon is an adorable spot for brunch. Lots of healthy options, but not so healthy that it's not delicious. I loved my eggs, chicken sausage and beans. A very reasonably priced start to my Saturday!"}
{"text":"Situated near Queen/Ossington this casual eatery is great for brunch and lunch. I've gone several times for brunch and coffee during the weekends and have found the food (and coffee) to be on point. The atmosphere is inviting and laid back, staff are attentive and service is great. The coffee is made using a local Toronto roaster (Cut Coffee) and the americanos and cappuccinos are well made. All the brunch dishes I've tried are delicious and filling (especially love the omelette!). Will be back for more when I'm around the area!"}
{"text":"Although we only stopped in for organic, fresh pressed orange juice and a latte, we'd come back if we were in the area. It's in a fun part of town and the prices are affordable. If you like organic cafes, this one is for you!"}
{"text":"I tried cafe neon last weekend for brunch with a friend. Prices are really cheap which intrigued me. We had to wait but it was only for like 10 minutes so we grabbed drinks at Starbucks beforehand.  Service was friendly. I got the neon breakfast which came with eggs, home fries, your choice of meat and salad. I love when breakfasts include salad. The portion size was perfect but I wish I liked the turkey sausage more!! Oh well.  I'll have to come back and try something else :)"}
