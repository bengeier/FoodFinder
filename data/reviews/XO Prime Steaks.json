{"text":"Definitely a place to go on a special occasion. The service was great! Made reservations but didn't really need them since there was a blizzard outside and not too many people were out. The steaks were cooked perfectly. The sides could really be split between 2 people. Everything we got was amazing!"}
{"text":"I had the bone in ribeye, ol girl had the tuna and we both loved every bite. Cant wait to go back and try other selections !!!"}
{"text":"37$ for a seven ounce filet is the cheapest thing on the menu.  Includes nothing.  Sides such as a potato is 9$. Soup 8$. Salad 10$.  So dinner and one drink is 75$.  Stupid."}
{"text":"The food was very good and everything was done just as requested.

My issue with the experience was when the waiter's attendant asked if he could clear our plates and we asked for a box. He openly mocked us for wanting to take the remainder of our meal home. Even if there are only a couple or so bites left on each of our plates, when you are spending $300 on a meal asking for a box shouldn't be accompanied by mockery from the wait staff. 

In addition, we hardly touched our sides because we filled up on the other great courses. We also had the sides boxed for us which included the lobster mac and cheese. When we got home we saw our two sides had been combined together into one small carry out box and food was definitely missing from our sides! We hadn't touched half of the lobster mac and cheese side dish but somehow only came home with a spoonful in our box and not a single piece of the lobster made it home! 

We would not go back based on this experience. I expect much more from a fine dining restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is really good and the atmosphere is very laid back. I spent New Year's here with a group and we had a ball. Also, came here for a birthday and the wait staff was very sweet and accommodating."}
{"text":"Loved the food! Loved the waiter - Johnny!  My friend and I just saw the Jersey Boys and decided to try XO after the show. We tried everything from the appetizers to desserts. when our waiter brought out my creme brulee he wrote in chocolate across my plate \"Jersey Boys\"."}
{"text":"I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks this place is only ok. People seem to talk about it like it's Peter Luger's or something, but I don't think it is. I don't remember exactly what I ordered, but it was something like a tuna tartare that was all right, the filet, and a couple glasses of red wine, but I don't remember what kind exactly, and 3 sides for the two of us to share. I do remember feeling like everything was fine, but not special, and that the waiter seemed to have no interest in us when we stayed with glasses of wine instead of buying a bottle, even though I was drinking red and my friend preferred white. We even had a difficult time getting service to order our second glass, and would have ordered a third if we had been able to summon our waiter. The service was very disappointing most of all. I would go back again if someone else invited me, but I would never suggest this place again."}
{"text":"Went here for a post Valentine Day celebration after a bad restaurant experience elsewhere. Food was awesome and the service was on point. Expensive but worth it."}
{"text":"This was a great place and the scallops were so great! I took my fiancé here for her birthday! It was very delicious and they even gave us free dessert because it was her birthday."}
{"text":"Really amazing food.  Steaks are prime and amazing...seafood is fresh, waiters are on the ball and its downtown.   They always have valet for $10 and we have a blast!  Short walk to Jack casino and the night is a great one!  Love our XO Steakhouse!"}
{"text":"Nice but over priced for what you get. Pressure sales on high end dishes.
I felt like I was at a used car lot with a high pressure salesman. The waiter was not very friendly and very unhappy that we did not buy the $110 bottle of wine, the $75 appetizer and the $40 Mac and cheese. Steak was over cooked to top it all off!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and experience.  Ate here during Restaurant Week.  We tried the filet and the salmon options ... .both were some of the best I had ever tasted!  The service was impeccable with perfect timing, server with great personality and overall wonderful time.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever.   Do not go here if you actually want to be served.  The. Then the manager  said she checked on us and unless we were dead we missed her. 

Totally crappy service and the server blames the bartender for slow drinks that sat at the bar for about ten minutes.   

I see them out of business if this continues"}
{"text":"After hearing that this was the place to go, we settled upon XO Prime Steaks for dinner. 
The restaurant is beautiful and very classy. We made reservations and were seated immediately. Only downside was our table was quite cramped with four diners. 
We started our meal with wine, cocktails and the sushi roll. For dinner, I went with the twin filet medallions and it was beyond delicious. The medallions themselves were cooked perfectly and the sides were a great compliment to the main meal. For the dessert, I couldn't pass on the hazelnut creme brûlée and it lived up to all my expectations."}
{"text":"I went during Restaurant Week for dinner with a few friends from work.  My first impression was that the prices were a bit steep.  But, because we were doing the restaurant week deal (app, entree, dessert for $30) I wasn't too worried.  Until I ordered a martini, although delicious...it was $12 and did not have much alcohol in it.

Here is a link to the restaurant week prix fixe menu: http://www.downtowncleveland.com/media/82206/xo_2013.pdf

I chose the beef short rib wellington.  The beef was rolled into a ball and surrounded with puff pastry and the risotto tasted like beef strogonoff.  While this was good...I could have made it at home.
For my entree I got the Surf and Turf.  On the menu is said \"Petite Surf and Turk with Filet Mignon Medallion and Sauteed Shrimp.  This took petite to a whole new level.  The steak was delicious, even though I ordered medium rare and it came out medium.  It was very small, which would've been find except the surf part of this meal was two tail on shrimp sitting on top of the steak.  This was not much of a meal.
For dessert I went with the trio of mini desserts.  It was a long plate with very small portions of four different things; strawberries with whipped cream, lemon raspberry bar, eclairs and coconut truffle.  None of the desserts were very good.  The lemon bar was extremely lemony and I didn't taste any raspberry.  The \"eclairs\" were stale and tasted like they had been sitting out all day, I took one bite and did not eat the rest.  The coconut truffle was extremely bland.

I would expect this level of food from somewhere where the whole meal was $20 including drinks, but after a $12 martini and a glass of wine with dinner I spent $70 and was unimpressed.

I will not be back to XOs unless I'm eating for free and even then I will know that I should only get filet mignon."}
{"text":"I visited your XO restaurant on Saturday with my husband for date night, and we both were very disappointed. The sevice was good, although the up sell was over the top. I felt the pricing is out of bound for Cleveland. I have had better meals with better pricing in NY and Florida's high end establishments. My lobster was very tough, and when I expressed that to my waiter, Stefan, simply said that he would let the chef know. He didn't even take the charge off of our bill. You can't have a chef in that kitchen, because a chef would care that his reputation was on the line. Your establishments is beautiful, but let's face it, it's all about that food, bout that food! Even my drink was terrible. I had a drink called the lipstick and it was soon bitter. You need to find a real chef, and you need to reduce your prices for the demographic, or you will be out of business in a few years. I am embarrassed to post that I visited your restaurants. For the amount of our bill, we should have been having organisms on our way out the door."}
{"text":"The food was awesome, the only thing keeping me from giving XO 5 stars was the fact that my waiter messed up our order and then our checks.  Overall, a great steak!"}
{"text":"We go the night before spend $1,500 and all is good, next day we get reservations and ask about taking our own wine but the \"very\" rude gentleman is yelling on the phone and has a attitude because we ask about bringing our own wine. Serious man? With this kind of attitude don't hope for repeat business. This is supposed to be a fine food establishment not a place to yell at the customers. Don't waste your time...go to Reds way better service!!!"}
{"text":"Had a very nice meal here. You get a steak in a place that isn't some stuffy old guy steak house. I got the sea bass and my guests had steak and lamb. All of the meals were excellent. Drinks were great and so were all of the sides. The service was excellent as well. Very attentive, but not overbearing staff. Totally recommend this place"}
{"text":"I come here quite often with friends. The food is good, cooked perfectly and the drinks are awesome. I usually get the Holy water.  Service by the bar can be a little slow but overall the food  and experience has been great!"}
{"text":"We had a really horrible experience. A long wait to be greeted at door. Appetizers were good then over one hour wait for entrees. My steak was over cooked and tough, Brussel sprouts and risotto were undercooked. Way overpriced!!!!"}
{"text":"A high quality steakhouse with a comfortable and ambient atmosphere. Portions are small but flavorfull, desserts in particular being just the right amount of richness. Drink service is above standard, but the wine variety and quality is a bit below par. Encouraged for larger groups you want to impress, for the check if nothing else."}
{"text":"My wife and had had an incredible meal there last night. The only reason my review did not receive 5 stars was that another patron to the restaurant sitting next to us was incredibly drunk and and very loud and vulgar. It was disappointing the manager did not ask him to tone it down. 

We had the filet and bone in filet both were amazing. The calamari was one of the best we had ever had. I would strongly recommend the three cheese macaroni r with prosciutto.

Lastly the service received was second to none."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I have been to XO several times over the years, and it has always been excellent.  I have not been there is several years, and wow did we have a terrible experience.  We showed up exactly on time for our reservation and we were seated promptly, which was fine.  Our drinks arrived in a timely manner and the server was ok.  The trouble started after we ordered our food, it took almost 1:30 hours to get our appetizers!  We ordered a cold seafood app that was very underwhelming.  it was $40 and had 2 shrimp, 2 oysters and 4 pieces of $5.99/pound crab leg knuckles that I could not even get the meat out of.  Then it got worse, at 2 hours in, our steaks arrived and they were all cold and well done!!  How do you screw up 4 steaks at the same time without checking them?????  That is unforgivable!  This is a STEAK HOUSE.  We were on track to pay almost $500 for this meal and they send out well done steaks, wow.  Needless to say, we walked out and will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I dined at XO for the first time this past Saturday, and I'm left feeling bittersweet about my experience.

 First of all I would like to say that the decor was chic; I loved the chandeliers, color scheme, and overall ambiance that the restaurant exudes.

 Next, I must mention the menu. The selection of entrees was excellent, there was something for everyone (not just steak). I was not in the mood for a red meat that evening and ordered the Bell and Evan's Chicken. This dish had everything, a delicious herbed cream sauce, fingerling potatoes, but also a ton of salt (mostly on the chicken). Despite that, I did not request to have my dish re-made, so I could keep up with my fellow guests. I also ordered a side listed under \"Potatoes\", which was not a potato, they were Risotto cakes stuffed with mozzarella and served in a  tomato basil sauce. The Risotto cakes were delightful and my favorite part of the meal. Lastly, In the beginning of the meal, a friend shared their Wedge salad with me since it was a hefty portion. It had cherry tomatoes, pecans, and a delightfully rich blue cheese dressing.

 I will definitely recommend, the Risotto cakes, and Wedge salad to anyone, but the Bell and Evans chicken only for someone who enjoys salty foods.

We had a male server, in his 30's (he was african-american), I could not hear his name. And is responsible for why I'm giving this a 3 star rating. 

Our waiter was rude, and made inappropriate jokes. Our meals were so expensive on their own that most of us decided to forgo alcoholic drinks, and our waiter kept pressing us to order them. A friend ordered an iced tea and he responded, \"a long island one?\", which was interesting at first but he kept it up for everyone throughout the meal, which we found extremely rude.

 Also as he presented my dish, he thought to be \"funny\" and say, \"here is the pork chop that you ordered\", and I must of made a face of horror, because I hate eating pork. Then he tells me that he's \"joking\" it is the correct dish, the chicken. THIS WAS NOT FUNNY.

 He wouldn't refill our waters without asking first (it was like he didn't want to, and it's not like we were drinking like fish), He wouldn't get refills for coffee until we were leaving. 

 I didn't go to XO to have a waiter try to be a comedian, alienate me from the table, and either rush our service or neglect it (which he did both). I may never go back because of the rude service. Our table spent over $250 on our meal not including tip, and our server didn't deserve it. I've had better service at a pizza shop that costs FAR-less. 

To end on a funny note, I heard a server at the table behind us describe the appetizer portions, \"Our appetizers are appetizing\". lol."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. I now currently live in Dallas Texas and can't find a steak this good. The filet Oscar is simply wonderful. We make it a point to eat here when we are town. Great food, cool bar and great atmosphere. I highly recommend XO!"}
{"text":"Despite the comment by the owner that My review posted several months ago was fake, I did actually get food poisoning about 30 minutes after eating at prime XO steaks this past January.

I'm a medical doctor, and food poisoning typically occurs up to several hours after consuming undercooked meats. While I was fine at the time I told the owner the food was good, I threw up 30 minutes later. I did go to Cleveland Clinic's ER and was treated for food poisoning.

Do not eat here."}
{"text":"I had dinner with three friends here on Tuesday, 3/24/2015.  The restaurant was not very busy, although it was almost 9 pm and a little late for dinner.  The atmosphere was impressive.  We were greeted as soon as we walked in by the host who offered to take our coats.  The bar looked like a fun place for happy hour or to gather with friends.  Our waiter was very good and very attentive.  I ordered the 12 oz NY strip medium rare with roasted garlic and herb butter with a side of XO fries.  Additionally, I had a couple glasses of the Sawbuck Cabernet. The steak could not have been better and was probably one of the best I've had.  It was cooked to perfection and the butter complimented the steak extremely well.  The meal was a little pricey with a final tally of about $78.00, although I will say that I expected a slightly higher bill with a couple glasses of wine and a prime steak.  This is a fun place to go and a MUST if you visit Cleveland.  I will go back again.

Overall call:
Service:  Outstanding
Atmosphere:  Outstanding
Drinks:  Excellent
Food:  Outstanding"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and another couple went there Saturday for my birthday. For our first time being there it was a fantastic experience. We all ordered steaks and they were cooked perfectly. The drinks and service were on point! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I knew it was expensive when I went, so I expected great food.  Wow was I disappointed.   I was there with 4 people including myself.  First, the crab bisque was luke warm, the lobster mac & cheese was good but quite greasy.  The asparagus were overcooked and way too salty.  I ordered the twin filet medallions.  1 was ok.  The other was tough. Sauce was just ok.

I was there on a Friday (last night) and there weren't many people there.  No alcohol.  With tip, the bill was over $400.

Worse than all was that the place was dirty and run down looking.  There was a light bulb missing in the light fixture (they cost less than  $2, are they desperate). The toilet paper dispenser in the ladies room was hung with duct tape, plus the sign for the ladies room wasn't legible.  The door to exit the restaurant was filthy.  I didn't even want to touch it.  

Stay away"}
{"text":"Server was very knowledgeable and friendly about the menu. And my wife at the 8-ounce filet which is very good with scallops. I had the porterhouse medium rare which was cooked perfect."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided not to have our anniversary this year at Mortons. So many people told us about XO but we had to see for oursevles. So on our 9 year anniversary we decided to go, we have never had a better steak. The customer service was amazing, from the server to the hostess, 5 STARS. The owner even checked on us and cleaned our table. If you are looking for the best steak in the Northeast. You have to try XO. 5 Stars to our waiter Bradley. This guy knew everything about the menu and made great recommendations, Great job.We will be back."}
{"text":"Firstly, the food was divine. Steak was perfect for me and the truffle mac & cheese is a must have side. I would have reviewed higher but for my colleague got his rare steak medium at the table. It took 15 minutes for another (just flip it!) and they still charged in full. Not exactly how I would have handled that situation Mr Server!"}
{"text":"An old high school friend of mine was in Cleveland for a govt conference of sorts, so I decided to take my first trip up to the area to meet up with her.

XO is one of the few places open late-ish on a weeknight in the area.  Part of the 5-star rating, admittedly, is the fact that we got turned down by maybe 7 other places prior to finding this one and we had already walked a mile or more in heels.  Not cool!

Anywho, XO welcomed us with open arms.  We both ordered a salmon entree which came with fingerling potatoes, which was fantastic.

Our server was either ADD or on some sort of drugs, but he just added to the ambiance, as far was we were concerned.  When we were ready to leave, we inquired upon taxi service and he immediately (no exaggerating) said \"hold on\" and ran outside and stopped a cab driving by. 

Now...THAT is service!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour Review

These are the best $5 martinis you will ever sip. This happy hour was excellent, from the atmosphere to the bartenders and the food items; we couldn't have chosen a better place to welcome the weekend. I am not sure if you can get the happy hour on the sitting area around the bar and the bar only has so many chairs so don't get there too late. This is on the list for my next dinner. I hope it meets the expectations of their excellent happy hour choices. Tacos and ribs were my favorites! This is one of my favorite happy hours in Cleveland so far."}
{"text":"They do have a pretty good happy hour that features $5 cocktails/wine and $6 apps, but I definitely ordered wrong!  I got the hummus and first off they were out of bread (naan) so they gave me veggies instead.  It seemed pretty good at first, but I quickly realized it was VERY garlicky. Don't get me wrong, I like garlic but it was so bad that I was actually nauseated the next morning because of how bad my mouth tasted even after brushing my teeth three times!!"}
{"text":"Went here and had a bacon wrapped filet with scampi on top i believe over the mushroom risotto and it was absolutely excellent."}
{"text":"Came here on Saint Patty's day. Deliciousness was oozed into my mouth at this place. 

The sea bass was cooked into a smoldering perfection and basked in a glorious tangy and zesty sauce. Fluffy and buttery Yukon mashed potatoes mixed with brussels sprouts was piled underneath the main dish. 

I actually got to try my coworker's steak, it was good, but I prefer my steak drowning in its blood. 

We also shared a side, the deep fried risotto. Anything deep fried is automatically delicious. Plus it was topped with tomato sauce. Yum. 

Decor is swanky and dark. Service is superb. Why not 5 stars? I know I shouldn't base it on their clientele, but there was one really annoying customer that we could not stand, and the rest of the restaurant for that matter. I didn't understand why the manager would not come out and tell this awful woman to simmer down. She was so loud and obnoxious. Manager = sucky."}
{"text":"Where did I treat myself to after recieving my Christmas bonus? Xo's, of course. We sat at the bar, ordered a stiff one and prepared ourselves for a special night out. I went with the wedge salad and a filet mignon, cooked medium. I am not kidding when I say they have the best steak, ever. The salad went so well as my only side. In the end, I wasn't overstuffed, so important when you are going out after. The drinks were flowing and let me tell you, the scenery was on point. The best bartender in Cleveland award goes to Guillermo, aka 'G'. I'm not kidding, he's the man!"}
{"text":"I was so impressed upon dining at XO the last time I visited my boyfriend in Cleveland. We'd heard good things about the restaurant and were very excited to try it. Happily, we weren't disappointed. 

The location was very grand - kind of like a mansion (we went to the Pepper Pike location). The inside itself was small and intimate. When you enter, there is a bar where we were asked to sit for a drink while they finished preparing our table. I was really impressed at the bartender's knowledge of the wine list...especially since I was feeling adventurous and when I explained what I was looking for, she picked something that EXACTLY fit the bill.

Our server, Jerry, was phenomenal. XO has a Delmonico steak on the menu - basically a boneless ribeye - and she actually brought one out for me to look at so I'd know exactly what I was getting. We skipped apps and went straight to dinner: Delmonico for me, NY Strip for my boyfriend. They were cooked to a perfect medium rare. And I mean perfect. We both loved the roasted garlic, too. I'm Persian so garlic is never simply a garnish. For sides, we tried the brussel sprouts which were a bit of a let-down...a little undercooked and greasy. The potatoes au gratin were very, very good - cheesy and creamy (whereas I found the potatoes au gratin at RED to be hard and bland). We both had leftovers and Jerry packaged them with an extra head of garlic, thereby earning major points with us. For dessert, I'd seen pictures of a banana cheesecake on TripAdvisor but unfortunately it wasn't on the menu. I did, however, notice they had a plain cheesecake and a banana foster cake - so I asked with they could somehow recreate the dessert I'd seen online. Imagine my surprise and jubilation when the chef said it wouldn't be a problem. It was as good as I imagined with fresh vanilla bean flecks throughout the cheesecake and yummy banana caramel sauce drizzled over top. 

It meant so much to us to have that time together since we see each other once every 2 months, so thank you, XO, for an excellent meal. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"XO steak is ok.. The quality of food used too be good but it seems the owner had a change of heart with his Chef.. We dined after a Cleveland Browns game a service was poor... be aware..maybe on a different night of the week might be better.. quality on steak ok.. best wedge salad.."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY! Have lived down the street for 6 years so I've been here enough to know the quality. Used to be decent 3+ years ago but, now needs to be burned down. Worst food, worst service, and dirtiest steakhouse in Cleveland. Food was room temp, wine was skunked, service nothing short of laughable. Bathroom was a disgusting sticky mess. Got a glimpse of the kitchen and would have left right then had we not been with friends. Also, after 11pm they start playing rap and it turns into some kind of sad club thing. I give it 9 months. The owner should be ashamed."}
{"text":"I rate this place 3stars. The service is top notch, the decor is great! The food ok. I got the bone in rib-eye topped with crab Oscar and the truffle Mac and cheese. The steak was cooked perfectly, the crab Oscar was way to fishy, did not taste like it was cooked correctly. The Mac and Cheese was just ok as we'll. I love the inside just over all feel of this place, just I expected more for the price. I most likely will not return for dinner, maybe to go to the bar though."}
{"text":"Went here for a dinner for business. The service was slow and it took forever to get my beer. The appetizers were out before I got my Christmas ale from the Great Lakes brewery. The appetizer was a mushroom pasta dish which was okay. The main course for me was a very small piece of steak with an equally small piece of lobster. The dessert was creme brulee which is OK. The steak was the best part. However for the price I was expecting more"}
{"text":"I came here for a business dinner, and I must say, I did have a pretty nice experience. This was my first visit to Cleveland, but from the looks of the reviews, this place seemed like a good place to grab some steak. XO Prime Steaks is located right on the corner in downtown Cleveland. The restaurant itself seems to be pretty popular for companies to hold events at. While I was there at dinner, the area next to us was rented out, with what looked like a PowerPoint presentation. Luckily, it did not intrude in out section. 

XO also has a pretty nice looking bar section, however, I did not partake in venturing to that area. Nonetheless, I was at least able to get the full dining experience. For dinner, I had a 4-course meal:

- Wild Mushroom Ravioli
- Caesar Salad
- 8oz Filet
- Vanilla Bean Creme Brûlée 

Oddly enough, my favorite dish that I had all night was the wild mushroom ravioli. This thing was just amazing. As an appetizer, you are given around 4 pieces of ravioli, which are all stuffed with leeks. This is topped off with a plethora of mushrooms lathered with a white mushroom truffle cream sauce. The dish has tons of flavor, and by the time I was done with it, I was left wanting more. This is a dish that is a must. My caesar salad, well, was a caesar salad. Pretty standard. Now, onto the steak. The prime filet is what I ended up ordering. This comes in an 8oz and 12oz size, but with a 4-course meal, I opted for the 8oz. Directly below my steak, was a fried hash brown sort of thing, topped with some spinach. The steak itself was nice and tender. There was flavor in the steak, but it wasn't distinct and memorable. Even so, I really didn't have many complaints. With desert, I decided to finish it off with the vanilla bean creme brûlée. On the side were a bunch of berries, and when mixed with the creme brûlée, it made a nice combo. 

All in all, I can't say that I was displeased with my meal. I came in here not knowing what to expect, but left extremely satisfied. If I end up coming back to Cleveland, I know exactly where I will be coming back to get some steak. It might not be like a Morton's, Smith & Wollensky, or Ruth's Chris, but XO Prime Steaks definitely gives downtown Cleveland it's own gem."}
{"text":"One of the best filets in Cleveland! Roasted garlic. Truffle creamed corn. Ba-nan-as!"}
{"text":"First off the menu has no prices. But if you have ever been to a top of the line steakhouse (which this is) you would know this is usually the norm. 

I went here for my fathers birthday. He was here visiting and he loves to hit a steakhouse in each city that he goes to. Everthing here was great and top notch and we loved it. The service was on point where they weren't trying to rush you out of the place but also not leave you hanging. He had the porterhouse and I had the double fillets. You could cut both with a butter knife. My father has been to some of the best steakhouses around the country and he said this one ranks right up there with them. There is nothing bad that I can really say about the place!"}
{"text":"Superb quality steaks. Great ambience but slightly noisy for a steak place. Great service. Awesome desserts."}
{"text":"This place is an upscale/professional casual restaurant that I came to because it was restaurant week, which meant a way cheaper dinner than if you came and paid for their other steaks.  Our server even tried to tell us about a 64 ounce steak of kobe beef that we could have instead of doing the pre fixe dinner.  The appetizer was okay, but had a mushroom taste that overwhelmed the dish.  My steak was cooked unequally....some places were medium some places were well-done, but it did satisfy me.  Their dessert was good and refreshing with mango sorbet with fruits.  Overall, the decor may make you fancy but the food will simply satisfy your hunger and leave you feeling duped into paying so much for the food.  Maybe you're paying for the service, which was prompt and pleasant."}
{"text":"I don't normally do steakhouses but when I do I come to XO on New Years Eve and wait 2 hours because Joe Haden's there  I tried to order the risotto as an appetizer but the wait staff refused since it wasn't an option. When I finally received it as my side, I complained about receiving rice, not realizing these things were synonymous, who knew? A friend, received a pile of Brussel sprouts and I don't believe he installed (good verbiage) such an order. 

I would like everyone to have a great New Year. If you haven't set up a New Years resolution, you can go ahead and use mine. (My New Years resolution is to be more tough in certain situations). 

I do believe everyone I had dined with was pleased with their food. Oh by the way, I was dining with a total of 14 people and that isn't even everybody that I know. One fellow did receive his steak overdone and the restaurant felt over easy (I mean uneasy) about it and provided the table with a round of drink. Unfortunately I don't remember what the drink was nor do I remember any of the conversation that was had at this event. I was pleased with my Ribeye and my date. Yelp."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited XO again this past week for our anniversary dinner before heading out to a concert.  I didn't remember eating there before (guess that says something, but I am not sure what) but after we sat down I definitely remembered eating there.

Let's start with the staff.  Our server, Liam, was awesome.  He kept our time constraints in mind and was very attentive.  He even called us a cab toward the end of our meal to get where we needed to be.  He made the meal much more enjoyable with his great service.

The food was really delicious.  I got the blackened fish tacos to start which were out of this world.  My wife got the crab cake which was delicious as well.  We ordered steaks which came out at the exact temperature (which is hard for me, I eat it charred rare plus, which is a difficult temp to hit).  The loaded potato was great as well.  The garlic spinach had just wayyyyyyyyy too much garlic.  Tone it down and it would be great.

The only thing I didn't like was the manager.  We saw him flitting around the restaurant as some managers do.  When we were waiting for our cab, he came over and just took the salt and pepper off our table, never asking us how our meal was.  Give me a break- grow a set and talk to your customers.  This dude is just an uncomfortable looking guy, so I guess I shouldn't have been surprised.  Little man syndrome or something.

For a good experience, check out this restaurant.  Ask for Liam if he's working that night."}
{"text":"While the food was good, everything was over priced and the server up charged our table of 8 and our bill was over 1000 dollars! We will never go back on moral premise"}
{"text":"The food was good but like some of the other reviews the service was lacking. It almost feels like the wait staff is untrained for the restaurant's delivery. I thought the food was decent. To start we had lobster bisque which almost had a little bit of a lemon flavor. Not terribly strong, but enough to cut what can easily be a too thick soup. It isn't my favorite, but I have definitely had much worse in the area and would have this again. The main dish was salmon on crab risotto. The portion didn't seem large, but I was full after this dish and thought it was well done. Some of the better risotto I have had. Dessert was fried bananas which weren't quite what I was expecting. I thought it would be something more long the lines of bananas foster, but instead was deep fried. The breading overpowered the banana flavor.

All in all I would give the food a 4 out of 5. The service though is difficult to overlook and I struggle giving a 2 out of 5. It took a long time to get drink orders. After about ten minutes we had drinks and put in our order. There was substantial time between appetizers, main course, and the dessert which got a bit frustrating. It didn't seem overly busy, but the service seemed like it should have been packed. A few drink orders and food orders also came out incomplete and incorrect. There were also the awkward moments when wait staff were reaching across a plate to refill glasses with water. Going back to my initial comment I think XO could make great progress by training the staff on etiquette and delivery of food in a timely fashion. We were there for 2.5 hours for appetizers, main dish and dessert. That is a long wait time for three dishes of food.

With that said I think it would be worth another shot. However, I am not a major fan of steam houses so probably would not do this one again. In a city that is having a pretty large explosion of farm to table food the service really needs to improve as a compromise."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place for steak.  I have been there 15 times in the last 2 years and I have yet to be disappointed.  I even saw Kevin Costner coming out of the bathroom here...  but I digress.  The steaks are fantastic.  I love the rubs, and shareable sides.  Not to mention the glorious vodkas... kudos to you again XO"}
{"text":"We were invited back to XO by the manager and we had a couple join us who were with us during our previous experience. Every aspect of our meal was far more superb than our previous visit. The server was very attentive. The manager was present and checked in with us numerous times. I've never received such good customer service. The food, once again, was delicious. The scallops and shrimp were the largest I've seen. The French onion soup and the crab bisque were both amazing. The amount of crab in the bisque was impressive. Our friend had a side of corn and I was blown away by how fresh it was. Our water glasses were never empty. I would go back in a heartbeat and I would wholeheartedly recommend XO to anyone who is looking for a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"I went a few years back. But have never had a steak better then this, I been to Mastro's , Ruth chris &  many more steakhouses this so far the best. In Cali Ruth chris is the best"}
{"text":"This was the worst service I've received in my entire life. We made a reservation at 7 pm for a 9pm Cavs game. We ended up leaving at 8:30, without eating our steaks. The waitress was atrocious and did not even check on us once during this entire time. We asked several other staff for straws, lemon, bread, etc and didn't get any of it. They were not even busy! Upon asking for the manager (who I think is the owner), he finally talked to me after spending at least 10 minutes talking to his friends fist bumping and shaking hands and he was less then apologetic and blamed it on big tables coming in late. The food was good, but for the price I expect quality service. I could get a more attentive wait staff at an Applebees. I have no intention of returning and will instead spend my money Red or Morton's if I want a steak."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my food and the wine list was good... like others I had an uber cheesy waiter (used car salesman) but we kind of had fun laughing at his \"sales\" skills. And, it may be a bit pricey, but I'm okay with that, if the food and service is good.

My issue, was that when I later compared my receipt with my CC statement, I found that my cheeseball waiter had charged an extra $10 above his 20% tip!!! You don't expect to go into a nice place like that and get ripped off for $10, especially after dropping over $500. Crazy! 

I have left a message for the manager, but have yet to hear back from him - disappointing and total crap that it happened. BEWARE!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since they opened in 2003. Now I'm afraid it was my last visit. They used to have the MOST tender steaks. Even the NY Strip Steak, which got ordered by mistake, was almost as tender as the best steak I've had there. The sides used to be HUGE and were decadent. Now the Garlic Mashed potatoes are dry and over-garliced (and I eat garlic all the time). The macaroni and cheese is a giant bowl of salt with some peas thrown in. We ordered two Delmonico steaks and the Ribeye. One Delmonico came back as expected. The other was tough, and the Ribeye was like buying a Select grade - tough to cut through, the entire steak! Their sides are about half the size they were just a few years ago. Sadly, profit levels seem to have over-ridden their quality. It was a Thursday night, so maybe it was a new steak chef they were training?"}
{"text":"This is a great late-night destination. Service is always attentive and food is spectacular. Only problem is that food takes a long time to arrive, in which case I suggest you order appetizers as soon as the server greets you. Decent wine list."}
{"text":"We went to this steakhouse around 8:30 pm on a weekday.  There was no valet service available, so we had to park someplace across the street.  Considering this restaurant to be a 'prime' steak house were 'famous' people come, I would think there would have been a red carpet service beginning from the door.  But apparently not.

The host seated us by the window, obviously that means cold air blowing in from the old windows.  Need to improve on that a bit.  And I also noticed the TV wiring was plated super ugly, and the decor was next to 'boring'.

The manners of the waiter was close to the ones at a 2 star steakhouse.  DId not have much knowledge about the menu nor had any clue what the '2% USDA' meant on the menu.  I would expect the waiter to know everything about the menu...especially when the prices for the items on the menu are pretty high...customer should know what he is paying for.

We started off with the calamari and a seafood sushi/ceviche platter.  The calamari was a bit oily for my liking and the seafood platter was next to nothing...very overly priced with very little serving portion.

Everyone on our table ordered either a filet steak or a porterhouse.  
The sides were decent, especially the garlic mashed potatoes.

I was not too impressed with the dessert selection and the chocolate molten cake I had was pretty dry and the canned cherry's that came with the dish were...pretty canned.

Room for improvement - decor, serving portion size for appetizers, better dessert selection"}
{"text":"I have eaten at many steak houses all across the US and thought this was the best steak I have ever eaten hands down. The service was upscale as well as the restaurant. But they still state my co-worker and I even with Jeans. My co-worker got the steak and lobster special. He could have eaten for 3 weeks on that portion size, it was huge and cooked perfectly. I got the Filet Mignon and it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. We both shared a side of mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. They both were very good.
Overall my favorite steak house in the country, hand down!
Price was a little high even for an upscale steak house. But was well worth it for the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"One of my favorite steak houses. Interestingly they have an excellent sushi appetizer and the steaks are of course delicious. It's a fun and hip place to enjoy some great martinis and eat one of the better meals you'll get in the warehouse district."}
{"text":"i am not a meat eater, but the bf says the steaks are real good!

this is a real fancy place in downtown cleveland...  what was i doing in cleveland?  well the bf happened to be working out there for a while, and when he works on the road he sends for the lonely cali gf.

anyhow...  we started w/the fondue.  yummm...  we bought a bottle of wine, which i don't remember what.. we had a couple scotches, either before or after the meal.. don't remember hah.  not that much veggie options for me...  but the waiter was kind enough to accommodate the appetizer ravioli into an entree by adding a couple more raviolis...  like i said bf had the steak and loved it..  we ended w/the chocolate molten cake... mmmmmmmmm to die for!

we had a nice romantic dinner here.. the place is decorated very pretty and classy.

around this time was the playoffs where the caveliers were playing.. i don't know if this was the spot after the basketball games, or what, otherwise there were just some tall ass guys -- a bunch  of them -- eating dinner.   along side were the decked out groupie bball girls, and if those weren't bball players, i take back the groupie bball comment.  hah."}
{"text":"XO's Happy Hour is perfection!!! XO is already my favorite  downtown steakhouse, so naturally I came as soon as I heard about the new, long awaited, happy hour. Divine!! I had the crab cake slider and tuna tar tar. Both delicious, but the tuna, with flavors of avocado and pineapple, was absolutely amazing. A must have!! The happy hour drink choices provide an option for every preference, including my favorite, the Holy Water.  Happy hour starts at 5:00 and ends at 6:30 so get there quick or you'll miss it.  Happy hour party next Friday, May 23. See you there! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed my experience at XO. This was probably the best steak I've ever had. Great atmosphere and great service. The manager came to make sure all was well with our table and was great! Thanks for the great night XO!"}
{"text":"We went to the place for it's restaurant week special. But when we got there they told us it was for last year! They can definitely update their website more often.
We got an appetizer and an entry for each person. Can't remember what we ordered, but it was pretty decent. The meal wasn't cheap but since it was steak, and we liked it, it was pretty good. Try it if you are looking for a nice place to have steak!"}
{"text":"Bartender was slow, didn't speak English and didn't pay attention. They allowed two punk kids to sit at the bar that were wearing jogging suits. I'm not sure why but it appears as though \"proper attire required\" is meaningless here. They were entirely out of place and made our entire party of 6 feel uncomfortable. It was so hot inside it felt like they didn't even have the AC turned on and it was 81 outside. Slow valets added to the frustration overall so I'm going to say pass on this place."}
{"text":"Thursday night dinner at 6. So so. Made reservations and told them was husbands birthday and no surf with his turf and no cake. Kinda bummer. Maybe red next time."}
{"text":"The food was prepared great!  The vibe was very calm.  The waiter was awesome!  The wine list was spectacular.  I could not have asked for a better experience at a steak house.  XO you have out done yourself."}
{"text":"Had 10pm dinner reservations. Was seated promptly when I arrived with my dinner party. Would recommend the filet, lobster mac n cheese, calamari, and the New York strip are all excellent choices. The waiter was top notch and the drinks were made to perfection. Overall this is one of the better steak houses in Cleveland that I have been. The decor is superb."}
{"text":"Excellent bone-in ribeye. with a la carte with-its served family style.  A bit pricey, but reasonable for the quality.  Waitstaff is very attentive."}
{"text":"Cool decor, good customer service, and tasty food. My steak was cooked at ideal temperature with a generous portion as a side. I'm coming back"}
{"text":"The food was really good and the customer service as well. The waiter gave the specials of the day and explained them well. My husband had the strip steak and he stated he loved it. I had the surf and turf and the butter tasted a little old. It was great he gave us a free dessert."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Even with a party of 61 in front of us, our service was phenomenal, orders came out exactly as placed, food was prepared to perfection, and our waitress was wonderful. These guys know how to run a steak house!"}
{"text":"This steakhouse was everything I could ask for. Attentive staff, good drinks and better food with great company (I provided that not the restaurant). We didn't have a reservation but they were able to accomdate all 8 of us. Husband had the Kobe Burger and it was AMAZZZZING!!!! I wished I ordered it for myself (Im sure the hubby did too). I had the lamb and it was delicious. It was tender and season very well. I had a piece of my cousin's steak was the season to perfection. I cant wait until my next trip to Cleveland just to go here...."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for a romantic night out. Almost too formal at times though. The server was very good, but she could have had a little more fun with us since we are younger and were there for a night out. Great food, we had the XO Tempura Sushi Roll and loved it. We both had steaks as well, she had the filet and I had the strip. Both were cooked perfectly. The sides are huge, which I am not saying is a good thing necessarily, but they are good. The drinks were great as well. Good selection of signature martinis and they also make a great Hendricks with a splash of St. Germain which is my favorite."}
{"text":"4.5 stars  I love an upscale Happy Hour and the new Happy Hour at XO fits the bill.  I arrived at 5:00 Happy Hour last from 5-6:30).  There was no one else at the bar.  I was immediately greeted by the bartender and then proceeded to review the HH menu.  There are 5 cocktails ($5 each) to include a Margarita, Black Walnut Manhattan, and classic martini, cucumber jalapeno cocktail, and 1 other.  I opted for the Margarita, which was expertly made, delicious and a deal at $5.  The food on the HH menu consisted of 6 appetizers for $6 and included BBQ ribs, grouper tacos, tuna tartare, chickpea & spinach salad, crabcake slider and a mushroom risotto.  I had a hard time choosing but settled on the sald and crabcake slider.  I would have preferred that the salad come out first, but all was delivered at the same time.  The salad was generously portioned and consisted of spinach and an assortment of mixed greens tossed with chickpeas, parmesan cheese and dressed with EVOO and lemon juice and then molded into a bowl shape on the plate.  Nice combination of ingredients, but a little bit heavily dressed, more lemon juice and less EVOO would have brightened the salad and made it a little less oily.  Also there was a generous amount of parmesan cheese mixed into the salad and ended up kinda clumpy when mixed with the oil, so it tasted more like coarse bread crumbs than cheese.  I would suggest mixing the greens, chickpeas, and dressing and then molding the salad on the plate and then sprinkling with the cheese.  It was still a very good salad and I would order it again (and again:-)   The crab cake slider was also nicely portioned, probably 4\" in diameter, nice thickness, served on a toasted brioche bun with a side of handcut fries.  The crabcake was seasoned well (a little bit too much salt), but was very good, along with the fries.   There were also bowls of homemade BBQ dusted potato chips on the bar to munch on while waiting for my food.   This was a very good Happy Hour meal, I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I just had the best steak ever at a steakhouse in Chicago 2 weeks before, a 55 day old dry aged steak cooked to perfection.  Or this place just isn't that good.

I went with co-workers who have dined there before and have admitted it wasn't as good as they remember.

I had their kobe beef tomahawk rib eye, cooked medium rare.  We also ordered pretty much every side they had too.  Started with their caesar salad and chorizo stuffed calamari.

The good, the chorizo calamari and the truffle oil jalepeno mac and cheese.  Everything else was just ehh.........ok"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner. Place was very nice, nice ambiance and decor. The food is excellent, can't go wrong if you're looking for a prime steak dinner. Sides are huge to share."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here for an early valentines we did the full tour drinks salads apps entree sides and dessert. All was deliciously prepared our server was  polite. The tomahawk ribeye was outstanding! And my wife loved her scallops. Would definitely return.  Our only complaint would be the size of the chilled appetizer, for the price would have liked a bit more but it all was of good quality and very tasty."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try XO and decided to select it for my birthday dinner. Phenomenal choice, if I do say so myself! I couldn't have asked for a better birthday dinner or service. My parents were here from out of town, too so I know I had to make it good. Sure, it is on the pricey side but as many other reviews have stated previously, you get what you pay for. XO is ideal for a special occasion or celebration. All 4 of us got some type of steak. I personally had the petite filet and lobster tail and all of it was perfection- down to the last bite. I can't even remember when I had a steak so good. 

The sides do not come with the meal but are big enough to share with 2-3 people. We got the fries which were delicious and the mac & cheese which was orgasmic! The service was top notch. It is obvious they are trained very well and do not cut any corners on any part of the dining experience! A+++"}
{"text":"marginally better than average steakhouse. Believe me! I have been a few in few different cities/countries."}
{"text":"Holy Crap.

I had no idea what I was missing. This is possibly the best restaurant experience I have had in Cleveland. Maybe ever.

I took my mom there for our birthdays, as she is in town for a week or so, up from the Tampa Bay Area, near the famous Bern's Steakhouse. I say this only because she is not a Longhorn/Applebees person as many of our parents are (and many of the folks that gave XO bad reviews, I'd imagine).

Order which steak you want, then a couple sides...they will easily feed 2-3 people. Most everything there is \"create your own\", so any rubs or jus you'd like to add to your plate is up to you, although they all cost extra. In other words, your steak comes just as itself. You can eat it that way (highly recommended) or dress it up to your dream expectations (also highly recommended). 

Mom got the Filet, and I got the NY Strip. The server did not wince at her when she ordered her temperature of steak...she is always indecicive with her ordering, and makes a strange face when telling the server about her steak. He didn't bat an eyelash, and offered some great suggestions. Speaking of the waiter, he was extremely pleasant, not condecending at all, no \"forced\" behavior or friendliness. He seemed to enjoy his job, and knew the menu. He even talked with my mom about Bern's, when she mentioned it!

I am trying to be nice lately, so I am fighting hard not to address the few bad reviews below, where people ordered sushi and felt the need to give a low grade based on that sushi (...at a steakhouse...). I just had to delete a whole rant section I wrote in regards to one of them in particular.

XO Prime Steaks is simply one of the best restaurants in Cleveland, if not the best. I have no idea why it took me so long to try it. I will be back there, within the month. I can't wait."}
{"text":"Punchline: don't recommend coming here. 

Their bread and butter were just okay. Well maybe not good. The dish for the steak was just room temperature which was totally not right and unprofessional. Given that, the steak was overcooked, surprisingly. 

I ordered a piece of medium-rare porterhouse but it's more like medium-well, which was kinda amazing too. I'd like to ask for a new one but the sever came to me too slow. The manager finally noticed something wrong and came to me but by then I'd done half of the steak. I was too disappointed and wouldn't want to have another one since i knew I couldn't finish it at the end. 

However, they did take the red wine off my check but still will not come here again and not recommend to come here either."}
{"text":"Steakhouses are not normally my first dinner choice given my feelings that their above-average prices usually only buy you an upscale dining ambiance, but not so much a higher quality meal. However, I can be convinced once every blue moon to try a new steak house and I have to say that XO Prime exceeded my expectations, but perhaps not that of my friends. I ordered off of a restaurant week menu and found my petite steak cooked exactly how I wanted it, and it came with a delicious side of shrimp and risotto. The creme brulee was intended to be decadent and was excellent for the first few bites before it became too heavy to finish. One of my friends had an issue where his steak was overcooked, but the staff was very friendly and apologetic about the issue and made up for the mistake with some comp'd items. Overall, if I were to choose to dine at a Cleveland steakhouse again, the excellent service, great atmosphere, and food quality would place XO at the top of my list."}
{"text":"After reading our reviews of our first visit, the manager at X/O contacted myself and the person who booked our group dinner and invited us back to provide his team the opportunity to show their service could match the outstanding food. I have to apologize as it appears the re-review was never posted. So the delay was mine -- not XO's manager.

The manager (Austin) and his staff were outstanding and attentive. We were served an amuse by the chef and had all of the dining choices professionally explained to us. 

I enjoyed the bone in filet -- the meat was perfectly cooked and the bone just added to the flavor and moistness of this already decadent cut. The sides were all fantastic - I was excited about the Creamy Corn -- and it was as delicious as I expected it to be. While it's called 'truffled' the truffle flavor was not overwhelming - which I prefer. The Brussels sprouts and garlic potatoes were also rich, hot and delightful. The wedge salad was cold, huge and piled with bacon and knobs of blue cheese. I admired it, but got none as the hubs made a point of telling me how great it was. 

The hubs also had a split of a recommended red wine -- which completely made up for the odd wine service on our first visit. The recommendation was offered based on some questions about his preferences as well as his entrée choice. The pairing was excellent, the service professional and knowledgeable.

It was a meal and service that one would expect from a restaurant that leads with those strengths. The outreach by Austin was handled very professionally and he and his staff really showed what X/O does so well. While I would not judge their core business based on Restaurant Week - our first experience did have aspects that should never happen - or, if they cannot be avoided due to RW traffic/pricing, maybe X/O should not participate in RW. They are a fine steakhouse, their staff and food definitely lived up to that promise on our second visit. We appreciated the opportunity to revise our review and I am happy to recommend X/O and Austin (the Manager). 

Again - the delay in the second review is my fault - I thought it posted and just saw it was still a draft. Yikes!"}
{"text":"After eating predominantly eating ballpark food at Progressive Field, I was due to a change of pace. So I went to a steakhouse: XO. Clearly not a healthier change of pace, but a change of pace nonetheless. My friend brought me here; she knows I'm a carnivore and raved this was the best steakhouse in Cleveland. I trust her. She didn't lead me wrong. Delicious appetizers, particularly the lobster and shrimp. I ordered the New York Strip and it was delicious. Tender, juicy, and full of flavor. I'm a fan. The only way this dinner could have been better is if my friend paid for it. But that's not XO's fault."}
{"text":"The waiter was excellent. The prices were high and they charged you for everything.  Have to valet your car, coat check, veggies, salads, potatoes, etc. 

But it was the ambiance that disappointed us. Tables were very close together and with the tall ceilings sounds echoed.
We were only half way through the salad and they had our dinner at the table. Talk about being rushed. 
Just expected more."}
{"text":"I recently went to XO for the first time...Our waiter James gave us excellent service and was very personable...I had the surf and turf and my lady had the filet...we both enjoyed our meal and the steaks were cooked to perfection...The great food, the atmosphere, and our waiter James will most definitely draw us back for a dinner date at XO in downtown C-town..."}
{"text":"Overall, XO Prime was alright. I got the crab bisque ($10.95) and the Delmonico steak ($39.95) with some Red Wine Reduction sauce ($3.00). The crab bisque was REALLY good, but the steak was just okay. The worst part of the experience was the service. Our server was really nice, but he was really bad too. Any time he left, regardless for what reason, it would take him at least 15 to 20 minutes to come back. A friend ordered a jack and coke, took 20 minutes. We asked for the checks, too 20 minutes. There was an error on the check, took 20 minutes to fix. Gave him our credit card IMMEDIATELY because we didn't want to have to wait 20 minutes for him to come back and get them, took 20 minutes for him to bring the credit cards back. A friend ordered the Caesar salad with chicken, but he forgot the chicken. He took it back and got my friend the chicken, and comped the salad, but again that whole process took 20 minutes (I was long done with the bisque before he got his new salad. Lastly, the sides came out after our steaks (i.e. baked potato ($8.95) & truffle creamy sweet corn). Again, he comped the sides, which was nice, but it was still annoying. Overall, we (4 of us) were there for just under 3 hours! And I don't think we really did anything to make that happen, it was largely the service's fault. I don't frequent downtown Cleveland that often, so I would try something else next time."}
{"text":"Best steaks in town! Great staff!! I had the filet and tipped even more than usual for the exceptional customer service!!"}
{"text":"We arrived and were promptly seated.  From our very first interaction with the server I was concerned on how this meal would turn out.  Our server knew nothing of the menu, he didn't know the cocktail menu, wine list, or anything about the food.  Every question we asked was answered with \"I don't know\" or \"let me ask someone\".  When the server finally took our order he then had to return TWICE to confirm specific aspects of it.  When our bottle of wine arrived we were poured two glasses and then the server took away the bottle.  This greatly concerned me and I asked why that was the server informed me \"that's our restaurant policy\".  When I then pointed out several other tables with wine bottles on them he had a blank look on his face.
The food was mediocre at best; the cajun lobster was pretty good, the filets were horrible.  They were over cooked, I would have sent them back but service had been so horrific that I was afraid of what else might happen."}
{"text":"So I shared my saga with some Cleveland's finest patrons.

Oh yeah the responded, X/o is arrogant for the rich and famous so they put up with this type of BS so long as the food remains good.

Oh well, stuff happens and Karma's a bitch!

Yum yum my steak lovers!"}
{"text":"We headed to XO for my husband's birthday dinner. Overall, a nice evening out, good place for a romantic dinner...but I stop short of five stars due to a small snag, though our server was amazing.

Food was good. Hubs picked a filet/scallop surf and turf and I got a strip. Perfectly cooked to medium...I spread some of the roasted garlic head that comes with it on top along with the garlic butter I added. 

Dessert for me was an apple turnover and they brought out a complimentary molten cake for him - a nice added touch. (It wasn't molten, by the way, just moist). Both tasted very delicious.

So the snafu was the salad. Our dinner showed up and we realized our split wedge hadn't come out. We asked the food runner to cancel it. A few minutes later, our main server shows up with our salads. We explained that we no longer wanted them since our dinner had already come. That is the reason for my four stars. The server did however remove it from the bill, and box it up to go home which I think is awesome. I just believe that for a high-quality restaurant, you shouldn't have that kind of mistake. (I know, everyone makes mistakes, and our server seemed to be spread a bit thin, but I'm paying for them to do it better than everyone else, right?)

Otherwise, it was a 5-star experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I love XO. The sheer elegance of this place, along with the great tasting Collard Green Eggrolls, Asparagus, Bone-in Filet and excellent rack of lamb! If you are a more frugal diner, save up for this place and use it for a special occasion or date night."}
{"text":"I've been here before a few years ago and had an excellent experience. Decided to try out their happy hour here on a Tuesday night. This experience was not a good one. They didn't have any happy hour menus even printed. Once we ordered everything the bartender barely checked on us and treated us like an inconvenience. One of her friends stopped in (looked like she used to work there) and she spent the entire time talking to her. Didn't even say goodbye or thank us as we left even though I shouted \"thank you.\" We both work in the service industry and I still over-tipped her, but I know that she put no effort into our service and I just expected more out of a nice restaurant like xo. Was considering ordering steak dinners after a couple happy hour drinks but soon changed our minds after we felt like such a bother."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service /customer service aspect of this restaurant. I have reached out to them 3 times in regards to my experience and not once has a manager contacted me . I came there as a celebration dinner with my husband , long story short we both ordered steaks and a couple sides , after waiting 45+ Minutes for our food our waiter apologized for the wait he had forgot us because he had a larger table , finally our food comes out to my steak being completely raw . The waiter quickly took it back and I waited another 15-20 minutes for that steak, (this point my husband was almost done ) sides getting cold , I cut into a RAW steak again! Two times in a row , to the 3rd steak they just threw back on and it was so dry and tasteless . I wouldn't recommend this place . Please save yourself head ache."}
{"text":"Wanted to give this place more then 3 stars, I might have had to high of expectations when I went. I also went on Valentine's Day and they were slammed so maybe that was the reason I wasn't impressed with the food. The service was good and nice dining atmosphere just wasn't feeling the food, nothing really wowed me about the food."}
{"text":"Visited XO for lunch.  Much like when I visted La Strada (in a different review) the place was nearly empty.  When we walked in, there were two diners already seated, and when we walked out another two had taken a table to round out a lunch total of six.  I suppose that's a pretty accurate reflection of how things in Cleveland have been, unfortunately.

Fortunately for me, however, XO served up a very good steak.  To be sure, I'm not saying XO is up there with the venerable Peter Lugar's in Brooklyn, NY, but it certainly makes a strong case for the best steak I've had in Cleveland--though I'm quite partial towards Cabin Club in Westlake.  The bone-in Ribeye was perfectly cooked.  As for sides, the Truffled Creamy Sweet Corn was a solid dish, but the Smoked Bacon and Bleu Cheese Fritters were a disaster.  Definitely stay away from the latter.

Service was very attentive, but, then again...six people..."}
{"text":"Expensive, but delicious.  Service is impeccable.  The house mixed green salad is delicious to start.  You can't go wrong with a steak.   The salmon might have been the best I have ever had.  And you can't go wrong with a restaurant that has great bread."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit to XO, per my friends desire (says its the best steak house in cleveland). 

This is what I observed for an alleged 4 Star Restaurant (not really a ranked 4 Star but people refer to it as such). 

The tables were sticky. Sticky like you'd expect a table from Cedar Park. Which means they've not regularly sanded, resealed and varnished the tables. Nor do they do a great job cleaning them. For this sort of premium they're asking, white or black linens should be on ALL tables. 

The tall guy wearing the striped suit coat and white jeans- not sure if an owner or General Manager- but he was greeting guests while eating food (would go back and forth to a small table with a woman and child) and eat/ drink. - UNACCEPTABE for $$ they're asking. 

When I went to the restroom, I thought I was in the restroom from barfly- from accross the street. Hot, smelled of urine, not very clean, fit and finish of towel rack looked as if someone from wood shop threw it together, not even properly ventiliated. Again, disgusting for the $$ they're asking. 

Food- nothing short of unmemorable. Okay so you throw some roasted garlic with a twig of tyme on the plate as a garnish. That's amusing. This trick must work wonders for so many who have no clue what a real 4 star is like. There was nothing served that would demand such a price point- what so ever. 

Service? Not poor. Waiting did a so so job; remembered peoples meals, apps and drinks and fairly decent with promptness- but again, nothing wow'd me. 

When I spend $48/per plate, I'm not just paying for the food. I'm paying for the LEVEL of service and environment that I wouldn't get at Outback Steak House, or even Champps. I'm expecting on the same level as Mortons. Always VERY professional, prompt, curtious- clean, welcoming. Every detail - is looked over on a minute to minute basis. 

Or one better, Chez Francois- a REAL 4 Star;unbelieveable service with impeccible execution. This place is a MUST GO TO Restaurant. 

To the owners of XO- close down for 2 weeks, renovate, revamp your attitude and service and menu. Bring the level of game to that of a world class city. And then watch the waiting list, and profits soar beyond what you're doing now. 

Exceed Peoples expecations for people from OTHER cities, not just Cleveland. Help us put Cleveland ON THE MAP for 'must see places to go and see'. 

When you do that, I'll be back, and will personally take an ad out in the Plain Dealer for you. On my dime. 

Balls in your court."}
{"text":"XO used to be one of my favorite spots in Cleveland but I won't be back after how my party of 14 were treated on NYE. I made the appointment weeks in advance and when we arrived on time they told me they cancelled my reservation since I didn't answer my phone the day before. There I was with a party of 14 at 8pm on NYE completely caught off guard. I never saw the missed call and no voicemail was left. I didn't think to follow up with the restaurant since they had emailed me around 10am on the day of the reservation confirming the party and time."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I was treated to a complimentary dinner here as part of an interview with the Cleveland clinic and thus can't comment on the prices. I imagine it's not a cheap place but you can't be surprised by that.

While waiting for your party, they'll invite you to hang out at the center bar. It's kinda posh and trendy inside. You'll see some wealthy regulars and also some who are just looking to celebrate a good time. The custom cocktails looked pretty nice but i didn't have any. Service here is pretty excellent-- as it should be at any restaurant of this caliber. Everyone was friendly and extremely polite; you get the five star treatment here that makes you feel like quite the VIP. We were seated promptly with our rather large party when everyone arrived. 

The wine pouring was generous. I chose the red to complement the steak I would be eating later.  

I started the night off with the crab bisque. It practically inspired this review-- let me say that was far and above the most amazing bisque I have ever tasted. Salty, creamy and the right amount of spice, with bits of tasty juicy crab. I could have easily finished several more bowls.

I chose the sirloin cooked medium upon being reassured by the waitress that it would maintain an even pink throughout. In hindsight, I think I would have opted for medium rare as I usually order but it still came out to my linking. A hunk of sirloin is never going to taste like a rib eye or new york, but they seasoned it more than adequately. I was very impressed with the mushrooms and garlic mashed potatoes that came on the side. Again...I could have easily eaten much more of them because they were phenomenal.

The creme brulee was my selection for desert. It came with a side of fudge with mint cream and a small berry salad. Both were exquisite. The creme brulee was done just right with that crispy shell of carmelized, fire glazed goodness above a juicy interior. Yeah...it was proper.

They do things right here and if you need to impress a client over a business dinner or celebrate an anniversary, I daresay the prices at this place are well worth it."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for their restaurant week. We ordered off the special menu for that week which was a 3 course meal. I ordered the beet salad, salmon entree and Nutella Creme Brule for dessert. I was blown away by how great everything was! The salmon was prepared in a BBQ sauce and it was just incredible. I'm not normally a dessert person, but I ate the entire dessert. This is a place that I would not normally visit since it is on the pricier side, but the restaurant week menu made it affordable. If I visit again it would be for a special occasion. The only slight disappointment was the staff. I didn't think they were as attentive, but the food made up for it."}
{"text":"Visited XO on Sat night and was welcomed very well.  Had to wait about 45 min because we added two extras to our res at the last min.  NBD they have a great bar! Hand stuffed blue cheese olives, can't go wrong.

Steaks were excellent.  Having been to numerous steakhouses in my hometown Chicago and around the US, I know what is Good, Great, and Bad.  XO did a tremendous job and everything was top notch.  Great service good ambiance and vibe.  Will definately go back next time in town"}
{"text":"We chose an off rush time to dine, 4pm on a Sunday. After reading the reviews we didn't want to become ensnared in service issues. Even though it wasn't on the menu we ordered oysters. Nice and cold, however the cocktail sauce was mere tomato paste and not hot sauce or crackers (crackers delivered after finishing oysters). I ordered the 8oz filet rare and my companion ordered the surf and turf. My steak was almost room temperature and a little more on the medium than rare side. The lobster tail was okay, nothing to get excited about. For desert we ordered cheesecake. Not sure why but it tastes slightly salty. Overall the food was okay, not over the top as you would expect with a high end steakhouse. Nice decor, he service, to my surprise was fantastic. It's a nice place for an evening out."}
{"text":"This seriously was one of the best bone-in rib eyes I have had EVER! Our waiter, James, was very attentive (all the staff were) and had excellent recommendations and knowledge of the food. The meat melted in my mouth, the sides were absolutely delicious and the mushroom ravioli appetizers were to-die-for!!!! I highly recommend eating there and make sure you go on an empty stomach!! Every time I visit Cleveland, I will def be eating there!!"}
{"text":"So I took advantage of the Restaurant Week menu offered for dinner this week, and I was pretty happy with the result!  The menu offered 3 courses.  For the appetizer, I picked the Mini short rib Wellingtons, which were served over a wild mushroom risotto.  The mini Wellington's were fantastic, with tender rib meat stuffed inside their soft puff pastry shells.  And the risotto was flavorful, matching well with the Wellingtons.  I ordered the twin filet for the entree, which was served with a potato cake and spinach.  The filets were thin, but tender, and the potato cake was a nice crunchy addition to the dish.  Perhaps not the best steak I've ever head, but quite good and worthy of the restaurant week price.  For dessert, I had the molten chocolate cake served with cherries and kirsch whipped cream.  The cake was incredibly rich, working well with the warm chocolate center, the cherries, and the light whipped cream.  It was like a cake version of a cordial cherry, except better!  

Regarding other aspects of the dining experience, the atmosphere was fairly fitting for an upscale restaurant, and the waitstaff were courteous.  No complaints from that front.

Overall, a good dining experience and definitely worth the $30 paid for my restaurant week experience!  I would be curious to see what their other steaks have to offer."}
{"text":"I had the Bone in filet supposed to be medium rare plus but came out medium rare. I was hungry so didn't send it back. My bad but it was still pretty tasty with the herb butter and 7 pepper blend. Everyone else liked there steaks. All in it was above average and I would say the 4 stars is spot on."}
{"text":"I literally have not one complaint from this place.

Always such a lovely time whenever i am dining here & i adore the vibe/decor! I came in this past weekend for a bday dinner and i made the mistake of filling up with yucky ballpark food at the tribe game so i wasn't very hungry. 
I opted for the crab cake, which i've never had here before, and it was delish! Honestly probably the best cc i've had in Ohio. The mac n cheese is to die for (a fav of mine) and they serve the sides \"family style\" which i like. 
The food is always presented very nicely and the service has always been excellent.

It's a steak house so i recommend the fillet, super juicy and you literally can cut it with a butter knife! Also the lobster or surf/turf is a fan favorite as well.
Save some room for their crembrule! I seriously was not a fan of this type of desert, but after trying the mocha crembrule this weekend i was in LOVE!

Bring your appetite, you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! OMG, the best steak I've ever eaten. Loved the modern look of the place, especially the chain \"curtain\" behind the bar. Stopped at the bar for a cocktail.. wonderful martini, but a little disapointed that the bar didn't carry Noilly-Pratt vermouth. We were seated for dinner and I must admit, I cheated a little bit and looked at the menu online. The wine list was great and not overly priced. We started with the Wild Mushroom Ravioli which were two huge squares of loveliness. The sauce was divine. Next we shared a wedge salad (boys and girls you need to share the wedge.. it's huge). Bit of a twist on the wedge.. it's made with butter lettuce instead of iceberg and the tasty bits of bacon added a great crunch. When it came to steaks, both my husband and  I ordered NY Steak (10 oz). I requested medium rare plus and he requested charred medium. We didn't want any rub or sauces that are available, as we both wanted to taste the steak. Good selection of sides and we opted for Au Gratin Potatoes (very cheesy) and Sauteed Wild Mushrooms. The steaks arrived and were cooked to perfection!!!  They serve a roasted garlic head with the steak... so save some bread and you can use the garlic as butter. Yum!  We had to have dessert and opted for the Bananas Foster Cheescake. It was wonderful.. the cheesecake was not too sweet and the bananas foster sauce was wonderful. I'm definitely coming back to XO Prime Steaks, whenever I visit Cleveland."}
{"text":"sweet, warm hostess.  mediocre waitress (we ate in the bar, we were the only table and the bar was slow, so no excuses.)  the service was dry and i wasn't even expecting that much.  the martini antipasto was yummy so i had two.  the ravioli appetizer was perfect but the ribeye had no flavor and the spinach was overcooked.  the pumpkin cheesecake was delicious if you are into all crust and it being burnt at that.

let's just say the only reason i'll come back to this steak house won't be for the steak... it will be for the martini antipasto."}
{"text":"Group of 10 many different cuts ordered 8 out of 10 all happy with everything. 18oz strip superior cut and quality vs 12 oz. all sides great. One rare porterhouse steak order was disliked over seasoning application and loin toughness. Everyone full for about 85 bucks a head with several beers.  Excellent waite staff.  Manager allowed our group in with blue jeans.  I am going for tomahawk ribeye next time."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to grab a steak! Excellent customer service from everyone and the bartender \"Danielle\" makes amazing drinks. I recommend XO to anyone looking for a great atmosphere and delicious food."}
{"text":"Nice location, cute decor, but so not impressed with the drinks and Tuna Tartar. Waitress was a bit spacey, but ordered the Tuna Tartar; it was bland and for the price was definitely sooo not worth it! Ordered a specialty drink with bourbon (can't remember name and when I went online to their cocktail menu, it was blank - figures), but was watery and not worth the price. Not sure if I will go back seeing the two things I ordered was nothing special and could have gotten anywhere else downtown."}
{"text":"Yet another restaurant in downtown Cleveland with overpriced average tasting dishes. It's like these places have a stranglehold on this city because every other option downtown offers the same boring experience. 

The service was... a little less than what you would expect from a \"fine dining\" experience. Either that or we just got stuck with a trainee. She tried hard and we tipped her well but WOW it was pretty shaky and we felt bad for her.

For this kind of money and location I expected more especially after reading previous reviews. Of all the other fine dining I've done in Cleveland this place had the most drab interior by far. So not only will the food depress you but so will the decor. Then the $100+ check comes in to seal the deal. Nothing but bad memories from this place PASS!"}
{"text":"Gotta love garlic!

What a fantastic meal. We got the strip steak with the garlic sauce cooked medium rare. It was perfect. The sauce made every bite even better! And also the 8oz fillet, along with the potatoes au gratin and some garlicky green beens. Each steak was also accompanied by a whole roasted garlic clove. The server was very nice and unobtrusive. The food is by no means cheap, but if you want an outstanding steak, this is the place."}
{"text":"Have been eating here for two years, once a month when I travel to Cleveland on business.  I am a huge fan.  The owner is friendly, the service is great (although to be fair, I've only ever eaten at the bar), The food has always been fantastic.

I typically have the prime bone in rib eye - always cooked to perfection (med rare).  The sides are terrific - usually truffle corn, but have tried several others as well.  Sweet potato spears have some great sweet and heat.

Had the Kobe once.  To me it wasn't worth the \"upgrade\".

Had a prime rib there once as a special.  Was prime.. and it was, I believe, the best prime rib I've ever had."}
{"text":"SO delicious! I've been three times and it's wonderful each time.  Good Service. Terrific atmosphere.  Steak is flavorful and tender. Salads are tasty and the apple pie is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Memorable but for all the wrong reasons. Poor management sets a tone for Horrible Service. Good food but surely you can do better. 

I get to eat out at great restaurants around the country. So let me help you if you are trying to decide if this is where you want to host your next meal in Cleveland. 
If you enjoy watching other people who were seated well after you were seated get their check before your entree has come out, this is your place. 
If you like not seeing your waiter for long, extended periods of time and have to go on a safari in the restaurant to find him, this is your place.
If you like your entrees being served intermittently at your table over the course of 15 minutes with lots of awkward \"please go ahead and eat\" comments, this is your place. 
If you want to complain to a manager who argues with you and tells you that you are wrong and doesn't really care what you think, this is your place. 

The food was good. But for the money we paid, the hassle we had, and the ridiculous amount of time we spent in there (almost 4 hours and no dessert nor coffee), I really can't recommend this place to anyone except the most extremely patient of patrons."}
{"text":"One thing that stays fresh in my mind when somebody mentions XO Prime Steaks, phenomenal filet mignon that were cooked and seasoned perfectly. The waitress and service were exceptional and friendly. Love the trendy and modern decor along with vibrant bar scene

Other items on the menu that I tried was Mini Short Rib Wellington for appetizer and molten chocolate cake for dessert. They were both excellent although the dessert could probably be toned down in term of  its richness. The whole experience was wonderful. It may or may not justify the price you pay for food and services, depend on how you look at it. However, it is a standard price you will see elsewhere for fine dining establishment. Highly recommended for special occasion. Also, it is ideal place for a romantic date with that \"special\" someone but clearly not for the 1st or 2nd date unless you can justify spending the money."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Nice atmosphere, good service but the food was sub par.  Ordered the Tempura Sushi Roll to start & should've known when I asked if there could be a change - they were pre-made earlier.  They were OK.  The real issue was the filet.  Ordered med-rare & there was no juice coming out of it at all.  Gave it a try but would not return for dinner.  Seems like a nice bar area for a cocktail though."}
{"text":"First time at XO last evening and I would definitely recommend it as a place to get a very good steak. Chic, stylish, and very very good. An evening well spent"}
{"text":"4.5 stars

My husband and I went here for our 1 year anniversary and I was very happy with everything, which was a tough job for them to do since I expected a lot on my anniversary. First, we got here a couple hours before our reservation and decided to hang out at the bar and drink. We noticed that the bartender seemed like a pro. She was very nice and probably the heaviest pours in Cleveland. Try had some free chips out on the bar as well which I thought was nice touch. 

So at our reservation time we went and sat at a table. We ordered the calamari and the spicy lobster roll and both were very tasty. A great start to the meal and very fresh and cooked very well. Next, my husband got a steak, the delmonico I believe and I got the sea bass. Both were phenomenal. If you want a quality meal, you will get it here. I also got a side of brussel sprouts were tasty but nothing special and my husband got a baked potato which was as big as my head and about as good as a baked potato can get. So for dessert we got the seasonal cheesecake and it was sooo decadent and tasty. We were so full by the end of meal we were miserable. 

The service was good, although we got a newby I think so you could tell he was nervous, which wasn't a terrible thing. He did a very good job and they really take care of every detail for you.

This is an exceptional place and the price shows that as well. This is not a place for an every day meal, at least not for me. It's pricy but with the level of quality you get I thought it was worth it. There is probably only one better steak in the world that I have had and that was at Hyde Park, which is extremely hard to beat."}
{"text":"IN THE FORM OF GREATNESS
Twice in one weeks leads me to believe this place is a pretty darn good choice.  The Striped Sea Bass was absolutely perfect from the double side of brussels sprouts (no carbs) to the finger licking sauce.  The decor is elegant yet nontraditional which I absolutely love.  High five to the cow hide seating!

MIXED FEELINGS
Other than the Tuna Tartar the rest of the Trio of Tuna appetizer is fit for flinging across the room.  During my second visit that week I opted for the Five Pepper Seared Ahi Tuna simply because I got nervous aka tipsy after the three glasses of Continuum I downed.  From what I can remember and I'm digging deep here, it was good but not great (insert cough, Dante's in Tremont has the best ahi tuna by far).    

BAD TO THE BONE
Closes at 9pm on Sunday.  Yikes, where is the after-hours spot now that I'm all sauced up after a two hour dinner, a bottle of wine and a gin & tonic.

peace, blessing, salad dressing

{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse in Cleveland.  My girlfriend and I come here for special celebrations - i.e, my birthday.  The three times we've gone here, she's gotten the filet mignon medium well and I've gotten the bone-in ribeye medium.  Two out of three times, they've cooked the steaks perfectly - once though, the filet mignon was cooked too well done and the bone-in ribeye was medium rare to me.  They also have a variety of sauces for a fee, but the steaks really don't need sauce to taste good.

For appetizers, I would recommend the southern-style crab bisque - it's creamy, smooth and fantastic.  Sometimes, though, they replace the crab stock with lobster stock, which is a pity because my girlfriend is allergic to lobster.  I've also tried the mushroom ravioli appetizer, but it has too much ravioli and too little filling.

Either way, this is where we go when we want to celebrate something with steak.  Their service is great too.  Last time I came here for my birthday, they gave me a free dessert!"}
{"text":"XO is ok.  The location is cool, the space is nice, the service was good, the bar was really cool, but the food lacks, especially given the cost. Xo tries to be a very high end steak house.  On the night we visited, the steaks were just not good enough.  Nowhere near.   The bone-in ribeye steaks we had should have been tender and incredibly flavorful.  They weren't.  They were fairly tough and in need of seasoning. Too bad.  Even though I kinda liked the place, I won't go back.  Not for a mediocre steak dinner for about $75 pp."}
{"text":"If you want quite possibly the best burger ever, try the kobe burger.  Full of flavor, and satisfying.

I, unfortunately though, did not order this.  I'm not sure what compelled me to get sushi at a steak house, but yes, this is what I did exactly.  I had a selection of different tuna sushi, and it ranged from \"bleh this is disgusting!\" to \"yeah it's just ok.\"  I had some XO fries too, which would have been quite tasty to finish off my meal had the waiter not taken them away before I was actually done with them.  I guess he assumed we were already done eating but he had not actually asked us if we were done.  By the time I had realized that he had taken away the fries, he was already gone to get the check and the fries were off in no man's land..."}
{"text":"arrived at 8 pm, had a reservation in for over a month, had to wait at the bar for about a half an hour, no big deal, had a couple of cocktails.....
menus had different prices between them, asked server about it, said that it's what is in the computer is the price, so BE CAREFUL, what you think you're going to pay, may not be what you're going to pay......despite that little glitch, food was delicious, as usual......foie gras sliders for an appetizer is a must!!! all the steaks are properly prepared to order, huge and well seasoned! the side of au gratin potatoes is enough for two, wedge salad was huge, as well, but i couldn't stop myself from eating the whole thing.......service is friendly, polite and professional. our server, jackie, is one i would ask for again. key things to remember.....BIG PORTIONS, for BIG APPETITES!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our wedding anniversary since we had gone there early on in our relationship and loved it. Well this time I can't say the same. First of all we waited about 10 minutes for our waiter to come around, no water or anything. Finally he shows up and is not the kind of waiter you expect at a \"nice\" steak restaurant, maybe Applebee's? My husband ordered the Wagu, which was awful. I tasted it and instantly felt bad for him! I've had better steaks out of the value pack at Giant Eagle. My steak was good, not great, but not terrible like his $120 disaster of a cut of beef. There was a bug in my drink which I didn't discover immediately, disgusting!!!! He brought me a new one but probably poured it from the same bottle that fruit fly was stewing in. Still charged me for it. Also couldn't even recommend a red wine to have with my filet! Really?! The side dishes were also just eh. There was also a couple sitting at a table practically dry humping all night, making out non stop!! Which was not what I wanted to look at while I watched my husband eat his sad steak. The waiter didn't even ask if we were celebrating anything special, I'm pretty sure they even ask you that at Red Robin. At least there we coulda got a balloon with our mediocre food. Maybe a free sundae. Thanks for making our wedding anniversary memorably awful!!"}
{"text":"The best steak I've ever eaten was at this restaurant.  I'm now a regular, and to give you an idea how spoiled I am, I can't even eat at Morton's anymore - it tastes like salty, dried out cheap steak compared to XO.

The least expensive steak is the tastiest - the Bone-In Rib eye ($37).

The house-made dressings are fantastic, as are the scalloped potatoes.

The service is great, and nearly every time I'm there I bump into someone famous.  2 weeks ago: Samuel L. Jackson.  That was cool!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate there Sunday. Amazing. His tomahawk was great cooked to perfection. I had the filet and lobster tail. Cook excellent was very delicious. Banana creme Brule outstanding. The best part of the evening was the manager. I've never seen such an excellent manager. The waiter was very good. Next time I'm in Cleveland I will be there for dinner."}
{"text":"Came here for a business dinner. Had the NY strip and beet salad to start. The steak had a good crust/sear and was cooked to my preference of medium rare. Would say the steak is probably above average, but not mind blowing. 

Service was decent and is open late in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Short version: Food was AMAZING. Service was REALLY lacking.

I came with my husband for a date night. We had heard this place had great food, but poor service, so I was basically anticipating the same. We first ordered champagne, but we were brought the wrong initially, which is no big deal. Then my husband orders a Sazerac, which is one of their specialty cocktails. The waitress had no idea about what that was, and after waiting a significant amount of time, brought him out a clear, green drink in a Martini glass. Sazerac is normally dark and in a lowball glass. We asked her if she made a mistake, and she (albeit politely) told us that this was a Sazerac. Hubby sent it back because he KNEW it was an apple martini. She comes back later to admit her mistake and that she was wrong. She did bring the right drink eventually, after another wait.

Now for the good: We ordered the Kobe steak, Rack of Lamb and Crab Cake. ABSOLUTELY divine. We both lived in NY and this is pretty on par for some of the better steakhouses out there. This and the ambience was what saved this place.

Back to the bad: Before we were done, we saw the couple next to us leave in a huff. Apparently, they had lost their ticket in the Kitchen and had been waiting a very long time. I can forgive one mistake, even two, but it seems like this is the status quo. We were at dinner for over 2 hours, and this was not our choosing. I became antsy at the end, especially when noticing that our waitress was tied up talking to manager for a long time about the above event. 

Despite the service, we will go back for the food, but will sit at the bar. I don't understand how a nice place like this can be so consistently known for bad service, but they need to fix it."}
{"text":"I've been to both locations and had an amazing experience both times. 
At this location I had the sea bass; the first time I had ever had it, and it was one of the best things I had ever eaten. It can with a lobster ravioli, which was also excellent I just with it came with two or three instead of one. 
The downtown location is small and the guests at the bar were a little loud, but that isn't XO's fault."}
{"text":"Awesome food!  My husband got the surf and turf special and the portion was huge! Perfectly cooked steak and lobster.  

I had the scallops and a wedge salad.  The salad was a half head of iceberg lettuce with grape tomatoes, walnuts, bleu cheese and bacon.  It was sooooo good!  The scallops were perfectly cooked as well.

Great dinner, great service!  We loved it!"}
{"text":"Food was good overall. Appetizers were kind of small. The Steak was cooked well but the meat was tougher than it should have been."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. The hostess and server (Andrew?) made us feel at home right away and were very attentive to our needs. The food was top notch, had the Kobe sliders and the fillet cut 9oz! they also had a great selection of Red wines and some cellar selections for a more impressive choice. American Kobe was on the menu, but I opted for something different this night. I also earned united dining points that night, total bonus when I can earn loyalty points! Great job XO!"}
{"text":"Third time at XO. Unfortunately it was a disaster. I ordered the 18 oz New York Strip medium rare. The first steak was medium well to well done. The assistant manager told me he would prepare another steak. The new steak came out rare. The manager took the steak back again to have it cooked longer to medium rare. When he brought the steak back again it was more charred on the outside but was still rare in the middle. At that point, I told the assistant manager to forget it and to make sure I was not charged for the steak. I was with a party of four and the restaurant did not offer any compensation for the poor preparation, not even free deserts for the party. Highly unusual for a \"fine dining \" establishment. I'm not a picky restaurant patron and this is the first time I have ever posted a negative review on yelp or anywhere. I eat out often so I understand every experience is not perfect, but at a place such as XO that wants to be classified as a top steak house, this was inexcusable. How can a \"fine\" steakhouse not even cook a New York Strip correctly. If you want a great steak there are other excellent steak house restaurants in Cleveland."}
{"text":"By far one of the best steaks I have ever eaten in Cleveland. If not the best steak ever. Great place to take the lady for a romantic meal. Servers, hostesses are kind and very knowledgeable about the menu. Highly recommend this downtown steakhouse."}
{"text":"I consistantly get the best steak over at XO!  I frequently go to Chicago and Manhattan for business trips but I still can not get a better steak than XO.  The service is great - wine selection is supurb.  Such a treat to live by such a great steakhouse."}
{"text":"For my birthday this year, my parents, my girlfriend and I went to XO and had an absolutely delightful dining experience. We made reservations for 8pm but it didn't matter, as when we showed up, the place was curiously empty (maybe because of the Lil Wayne concert going on at the Q?). Either way, that boded well for us as we were waited on hand and foot by our main server, Keith, and an incredibly attentive and unobtrusive staff who kept our water and wine glasses full and dishes circulating quickly.

I started with the caesar salad, and I'm not kidding when I say it was the best caesar I've ever eaten. I know it sounds silly, because how good can a caesar really be, but the dressing was tangy and had zip, the flaked parmesan cheese was strong and tasty and the lettuce had just the right amount of crunch. Delicious.

I had the bone-in ribeye for my entree with a seven-pepper rub and garlic & herb butter (my dad had the exact same thing, too). Honestly, Keith upsold us on the garlic butter, as it wasn't exactly necessary, but it was good. However, the pepper rub was PHENOMENAL. Really something else. My steak was cooked to a perfect med rare, just as I ordered (and Keith made sure to verbally confirm before taking our order in--once again, perfect service). Between the four of us, we split two macaroni and cheese sides as well as a side of mushroom risotto, both of which were damn near perfect.

For dessert, my girlfriend and I shared the chocolate lava cake, which was moist, rich and oozed all over the plate. No complaints there. The assorted fresh fruit that was also on the plate really added to the dish's overall composition, too.

For wine, we polished off two bottles of a pinot noir from Oregon, the name of which I forget but it was quite tasty, too.

Before we knew it, it was nearly 11pm, and the restaurant had finally started to fill in. We left with our bellies full (and leftovers in hand) and hearts warmed from an absolutely top-notch dining experience. Once again, I can't recommend this place highly enough. Yes, it can get pricey, so don't go unless you expect your bill to be in the triple digits, but it was legitimately worth every penny."}
{"text":"So you're also a vegetarian going to a steakhouse? Don't worry XO is pretty friendly to our kind.

I ordered the beet salad and mushroom risotto. The beet salad was delicious - it was rich and filling because of the (goat?) cheese and avocado. However the star of the night was the mushroom risotto. I wasn't even full after eating the salad, but I had to finish the risotto because of how good it was."}
{"text":"Everything you could ask for in a steakhouse! This was the first time I've been to Cleveland and XO Prime Steaks lived up to is name. 

We made a reservation for 5:30 on a Sunday evening because there was an event at the nearby arena. The bar instantly caught my eye with beautiful decor and we were seated quickly at a cozy table. Our waiter was actively present for any requests we had and was the nicest we've had this year. 

The fried calamari was cooked to perfection and the wine selection was extensive but manageable. I ordered the petite surf and turf; a 4 oz filet mignon with a grilled prawn. It was the best meal I've had at a steakhouse, hands down. I can't wait to visit Cleveland and XO Prime Steaks again!"}
{"text":"We weren't allowed to be seated until our whole party of 6 had arrived. The food was excellent but there must have been something going on with their kitchen. Everything came out mixed up. Our server was good but the bar service was slow. It took us about 15-20 minutes to get our first round of drinks. Probably won't return."}
{"text":"Thank you Farren for a wonderful experience!!!!! Everything exceeded our expectations. The food and service was amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"One thing about me, I love high class restaurants. We came here for my sisters 30th birthday. We drove all the way from Erie, PA. So, to drive that in the cold, this food better be fantastic. We pulled into valet and the gentlemen that were working were very pleasant and respectful. They didn't whip your cars around fast , etc. like most folk who work valet! so I appreciated that since we drove my car. As soon as I walked in you could see the bar area, and another den area towards the back for like private parties. This establishment had a historic feel to it but it was very rustic as well. We were seated to our table of 5 and we were kind of in the middle of the room. The dining area was very small, but some how they made it work. 

Service: Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the steaks they served and expressed the different style that they can cook it, etc. - He was very attentive to our table and made sure that our waters were always filled and kept our libations flowing. I loved his personality and you could tell that he loved what he does. 

Food: I am not a huge steak person! so I went with my seafood. I ordered the Pan Seared Diver Sea Scallops ( Asparagus, Fresh Corn and Smoked Bacon Risotto, Wasabi Cream Sauce) HUNNNY - My food was amazing. Each bite that I took I had to close my eyes and savor the taste. One thing about me, I love a good seasoned scallop. Although the serving was not that big, but it was fulfilling. They gave you complimentary bread as well. I was extremely satisfied with my plate. 

Before we left out, we asked if I could leave my car in valet as we wanted to venture to a couple of other bars. They told us yes, but we would have to come back by 11pm when the valet goes off duty. I was very pleased with that. 

I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"That was a juicy steak and some impeccable service.  The staff was completely accommodating to our party that did not belong in that restaurant on a busy Friday.  We shared many of the apps offered and enjoyed them all thoroughly.  They were very good with the timing of the meals as all 10 came out together magically.  I was apprehensive of just steak for my dinner, so I ordered some garlic mashed potaters which was plenty to share.  I love the atmosphere and with all the windows, it makes for nice people watching."}
{"text":"This is the best steakhouse I have been to yet, here in CLE... We ordered the calamari as an appetizer (best i've had thus far). I ordered the 8oz fillet which was cooked to perfection and we shared the garlic mashed potatoes and the creamed sweet corn. Everything was delicious! We'll definitely be going back there!!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to cleavand. We were looking for a nice place to go for our anniversary. We were not disappointed. Our server Richard was very welcoming and made us feel very comfortable. He did a great job explaing the menu and was very helpful to make suggestions. The meal did not disappoint and to our suprise at the end Richard brought us a amazing dessert on the house. Highly recommended the best steak in cleavand and service is top notch. Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Wife & I had a drink in the bar first before dinner; bartender kinda quiet (was a Friday night prime time 7pm).  Had Restaurant Row week promotion, $30 for app, entree, & dessert. 
Apps were decent (braised short rib and SW clam bisque), and desserts were really good (berry crumble and molton choc lava cake).  But entrees missed their mark.  
Wife's stuffed salmon was dry she said, and my twin beef filets seemed medium-well more than medium but taste was ok.  Some type of hashbrown risotto was fine, and I had asparagus instead of creamed spinach, but only got 2 spears.  Warm bread basket was good too.  
Ambiance and matre'd were very good, but wait staff and overall experience was better at Lola's.  Parking across street for $2 promotion was conventient."}
{"text":"The oysters were just average and they only had one type. Hyde Park had better oysters. 

The asparagus was great. Mashed potatoes were EH, but they forgot the truffle Mac and cheese! Was our server stoned???

The steaks were cooked to perfection however a the filet was a bit dry for my liking. (I am not s picky diner.) Tried the sea bass and it was delightful. 

Finally, I had to ask for steak knives. When you're paying this much for steak in an 'upscale' restaurant you expect better service. Probably will opt for RED, Hyde, or any of the plethora of other steakhouses before returning here."}
{"text":"This establishment was a major disappointment. It looks good from the outside, but it is not good.
The food was overall mediocre. I had the lamb rack which was tuff and tasteless, Brussel sprouts very bad. For some reason the chef crusted the lamb in hazelnut and mustard sauce. It didn't work.
Very very poor meal and for the cost was expensive especially for what you received"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go in Downtown Cleveland. I'm not a huge steak fan, but my friends are. I am a huge fan of their Salmon.

Wonderful wine list and service has made this one of my favorite spots.  Definitely make reservations if you are going for dinner.

A lot of the basketball players and many other high rollers in Cleveland go there, however it is open to all and the service is amazing."}
{"text":"This was an above average steakhouse and a good start to a saturday night.  The bar is plenty big with lots of seats it's located within walking distance to plenty of bars.  I was here with about 8 folks on Saturday night.  We started at the bar with some reasonably priced wine.  I think under $10 and they had some really good homemade potato chips with this great curry and cinammon seasoning I think.  We were seated promptly at a table in the main dining room.  There was lots of warm moodlight and the service was prompt.  They had no problem breaking our checks up into many seperate bills.  I ordered a bottle of conundrum that was reasonably priced at $52.  I started with a tuna trio, which was a tartare, sashimi, and a sushi roll.  It was okay, but I thought the tuna was not as fresh as I'd like.  The bread service was good.  I ordered the crab legs, which were pre-cracked and cooked perfectly served simply with some butter and I ordered a large order of asparagus.  The asparagus were good and large.  I also tried a friends ribeye, which was cooked well and served medium.  Others had the surf and turf, which looked good and they also had a nice cioppino.  I felt a bit rushed at the end, with the waitress asking a few times quickly if I was done.  She also didn't offer any dessert options.  This is a good spot with decent service and reasonable prices for the quality. It's worth checking out if you are staying in the city."}
{"text":"Decor: loved it!
Food: tasted great, steak cooked perfectly.   Mushroom ravioli app delicious.
Server:  room for improvement.  Needs some polishing/professionalism, considering the price and atmosphere.  More attention to diners. Was disappointed that someone else brought the food out.  This is the server's time to shine to the diner.
Bathrooms: need some detailing, fix the doors to the stalls clean them up, paper towels and Kleenex were cattywampus

Will go back again but hoping to see the above improvements!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite steak house in Cleveland! The steaks are always done perfectly, cooked with your choice of various rubs or butter. My favorite is the 10oz filet cooked with garlic butter. We were most recently here for Valentine's Day, so I splurged on the surf and turf - generous portions of each (we took home an entire meal for the next day). Wine by the glass won't break the bank, and you really can't go wrong with anything you order. For a nice steak dinner in Cleveland, this is always my recommendation."}
{"text":"Came here again with some girlfriends for my birthday celebration. I am never disappointed when I come here. Fabulous atmosphere, friendly staff, and great food! I had the 12 oz. double cut filet with a side of sautéed garlic spinach. It was plenty to share with a friend. Food was fantastic! Love this place and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Update: love this location for cav's game after parties and private events. Definitely the place to be with a nice combination of familiar and new faces. Order the calamari, crab cakes, and Hennessy Sidecar. 

Nov 2014: Excellent service and atmosphere! The crab cake was amazing! The best I'd ever had! Tried both sushi options, the tempura and the spicy lobster. Both were ok, but considering I'm a sushi snob I'd never get it again. My friend's steak looked well prepared and he orders it regularly. Next time I'll come with an appetite and get steak. Over all, an excellent high end restaurant for the young professional."}
{"text":"It took me months of eating here to figure out how they make their steaks so flavorful. I'm guessing after making my own at home one of the key ingredients is parmigiano-reggiano cheese over the steak while it cooks. It made my steak I cooked at home tonight mouth watering. I'll still eat at xo but now I'm on my adventure to find out how something else is made."}
{"text":"great steaks and the filet mignon is just like butter, mmmm I love the atmosphere makes u feel welcomed and catered too, I miss the heirloom tomato salad :)"}
{"text":"The service was the only good thing about this place. The steak was overly salty and nothing special.  The sides were alright. I expect much much more out of a highly priced a la carte steakhouse. This place is not in the same class as Mortons or Flemings. I feel they are lacking a true chef using instead a cook. That is unacceptable. I will not be back. The place was pretty empty so I doubt it will last much longer. The place across the street was full. I wish had gone there instead. What a shame."}
{"text":"Pretty much the BEST steak in Cleveland. Hands Down. Maybe the best steak I've ever had.

After moving cross country, I have not found any other steak that can compare. The Filet has a perfect crispy exterior and tender interior. Always perfectly cooked. I recommend the mushroom side as well.

Although some what pricey, its totally worth it. My boyfriend and I have already planned our visit for when we visit over the holidays."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for a bachlorette dinner.  I reserved the table for 8. Some off the party didn't show, it happens.  So we got a bottle of wine and had small convo while we waited to fetch dinner menu. At this time a server that wasn't our server tried moving us because we didn't have all 8 parties. We asked why did we have to move since we reserved the table. He said because it's Saturday and they might get busy.  Then our serve asked us if we just wanted to pay for drinks and leave.  Say no more,  we paid and left to another restaurant. Xo doesn't have to worry about getting my money! For a luxury steakhouse the service does not meet expectations. I wish i didn't have to leave a star because that's how bad the service was."}
