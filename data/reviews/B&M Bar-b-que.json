{"text":"Fresh ribs and chicken anyone? Slather on some of that \"slap yo mamma\" BBQ sauce, a side of that crab potato salad and you're good to go... Did i mention it's reasonably priced? Friendly service? Can watch them smoke those ribs outside? Yep, it's all there.... Don't let the bullet proof glass scare you off,  good eatins' within"}
{"text":"This is the most ratchet, ghetto business in the hood.  Call at 8:10pm and told we have to come in because they close at 9.  Get there, stand in line for 10 min, no help. Another customer for whatever reason lets us know it's cash only.  Good to know since we only had cards, I mean it's 2016.  Can't wait for this disgusting place to close. Great first impression.  Bye Felicia !"}
{"text":"The food was great!! Had a polish boy and a rib/wing combo. Wings were awesome and the sauce too. No need to ask for extra sauce, when they put the sauce on everything it's more than enough. Service is slow but worth the wait."}
{"text":"When you want some good 'ol 'down home' bar-b-que, then you need to head on in to B&M!  I go to the  E. 105th,  E. 152nd, and the one Bellaire on the westside.  This is probably the best bar-b-que and soul food in Cleveland!  The customer service is excellent on the westside.  My favorite dinner is the chicken wings.  Can't get enough! They are seasoned, battered fried to perfection, and the sauce is good.  Try 'em you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Cleveland...But I haven't lived there for 20+ years that being said I know good barbeque:) I was in town for Thanksgiving had to have some...my family picked it up the taste was wonderful and brought back memories I will visit again...I wonder if they can ship it......T"}
{"text":"Place is very run down and the food is mediocre at best. Staff looks like relatives of the owner and the have a boot leg man in the lobby and a single ripped bench in the hall to sit while you wait for your food. Definitely wouldnt go back."}
{"text":"It very hard to find good ribs in Cleveland. BM Barbeque new location on miles is terrible. Ribs tough and old tasting. Ribs should be excellent without sauce. Bathroom nasty customer service lazy clueless. Side dishes OK. There no love in there food. They were good other locations first open up but now they old and tired and no class about themselves. There restaurants dark and depressing and not clean."}
{"text":"Don't know a lot about the Waterloo neighborhood but I was starving and wanted to stop someplace in the area.  My trusty Yelp app pointed out this place and I'm glad it did Everyone always talks about Hot Sauce Williams and how amazing it is but the ambiance leaves little to be desired.  Being dirty is not charming.  It does not add character. That's why I think B&M is better.  Everything about this place was surprising in the best possible way.  You can see the smoke as your driving down the street beckoning you to the parking lot.  The smokers are always in action.  As you step out the delicious smell of meat greets you.   You walk in the doors and the place is immaculate.  I mean spotless.  There's no place to sit but it's designed so you can see what's going on in the kitchen through the bulletproof glass.   I tried the chicken wings and the shoulder sandwich.  For about 5 bucks you get a generous portion of deliciously tender shoulder slathered in homemade BBQ sauce and covered in slaw.  The BBQ sauce was tangy and light and the slaw was the perfect compliment to the shoulder.  The fried chicken wings were big, crispy and full of meat.  Definitely better than wings from actual wing places. This was a great experience and I would definitely go out of my way to go here again."}
{"text":"Was excited to find BBQ near one of my clients. I was spoiled down in Columbus by Ray Ray's Hog Pit where I ate nearly every single day they were open (Fri-Sun).   This place is cleaner than Hot Sauce, but the same low grade Cleveland 'hood slop.   Shoulder sandwich was a uniform and uninspiring grey with no smoke ring or ANY visual evidence of being smoked. I requested sauce on the side, but had my sandwich covered in cold BBQ sauce and as is customary in Cleveland, served on flimsy sliced bread.   I don't understand how people think places like this and Hot Sauce Williams are any good...."}
{"text":"Would you like B.M.?  awesome bar-b-que behind  bulletproof glass waits.   Having passed this joint up in the past, this joint got my curiosity up enough to stop in and fulfill my munchie desires. Big ghetto grills were smoking away in the parking lot. Always a good sign. Not a trace of litter in the parking lot - another good sign. The walk from the car to the takeout window (no eating in) was a walk through an oh-so-heady wood and meat scented fog. Heavenly. It could be made into a men's cologne. You look straight into the kitchen which appears to be big and super clean. No Ramsey Kitchen Nightmares here folks.  Simple menu.  RIBS: long, short, half slabs, by-the-bone...  RIB TIPS: 4-8-12 oz size, spicy/sweet Yankee style BBQ sauce.  SHOULDER: Pork shoulder superbly smoked and pulled with a vinegary southern style BBQ sauce. Sandwich or dinner option.  WINGS: with or without sauce. I am not sure if they have regular fried chicken, but I hope so, as these wings were full size, battered and fried to perfection.   There were a few sides, and a peach cobbler as well.   The pork shoulder dinner $8.75, was out of this world good. Super moist, deep smokey flavor.   The fried chicken was superb. By far the best I have had in Cleveland.   Rib tips were a tad tough at times, but I'd do it again in a heart beat. Or heart attack.   Real homemade coleslaw was a bonus!   All in all, clean, cool, and the real deal. -Don't be in a hurry, service is slow, but I'll be back B&M!  Carry on."}
