{"text":"Ordered stuffed peppers and had it for lunch the next day. Didn't realize it until the next day but the meat was raw! Called to complain about being sold raw stuffed peppers and the waitress decided that she was the manager and told me that it's the chef's fault and did not apologize or even tried to accommodate me. Luckily, I was able to reach the owner in regards of the issue and he was willing to be responsible for any issues I may have due to eating the raw sausage and was willing to refund my money back. Sadly, I don't think I will be returning."}
{"text":"Really ridiculously good, and I have to laugh at the pricey comment below because I spent $20 here and have leftovers for two meals, while also having fed two for dinner..Their pizza is fantastic, salads are great, and pasta is super yummy too. Also got something called pepperoni chips which are basically fried crispy pepperoni with Parmesan cheese which were great too. The atmosphere is definitely local and low key, more of a bar after dark, but who cares?! I'll chat with the people having a good time while I casually and happily munch on my pizza."}
{"text":"I think I have a problem, I've been here four times in the last two weeks. I won't go anywhere else for pizza now. The atmosphere is \"mom and pop\" with a quieter bar around the other side. The staff is also very nice.  Reasonably priced drinks, $5 pizza on Monday's and $4 pasta on Wednesdays. I wasn't particularly impressed with the chicken parm (hence the 4 stars) but the lasagna is pretty good. Their fish sandwich is hand battered to order and takes a few minutes so heads up. It's also HUGE. Go for the pizza if nothing else, then go back for more pizza.  Did I mention the pizza is good?"}
{"text":"Great value!  Good food and good service at very reasonable price.  Nothing fancy but a nice dinner of eggplant parm, salad and angel hair pasta.  Look forward to coming back for pizza"}
{"text":"Been here many times for lunch and always prompt sevice when I'm in a rush. Just close your eyes and point to the menu it's all good"}
{"text":"Great little Italian restaurant and food at reasonable prices. Service very good.  Specialties everyday."}
{"text":"Epic and amazing authentic Italian food... I particularly enjoy the pizza here. If you want amazing food inexpensive with great service than this is for you"}
{"text":"Can't believe I waited this long to try this place in Eastlake! We ordered a half sheet 1 topping and 12 wings, hot well done with a coupon. Great deal and great food. My daughter is always saying how pizza cheese never strings like on t.v....we ordered pick up and got home, I was getting drinks and my daughter was yelling how the cheese strings lol...plenty of cheese and for sausage pieces they were nice pieces of sausage cut up, not pellets! Wing sauce was hot, very good and saucy which we love with well done wings. Will definitely go back! And as leaving parking lot we looked at the little lounge area...all I can say is we plan to go back for adult beverage and one of those Margarita pizzas like in the photos here. Thanks for a great meal and deal! Wish they were located closer to lakeshore, we really need a good pizza place this way."}
{"text":"We had dinner here, my son,  husband and I was pretty disappointed.  It's kind of an odd atmosphere with very limited seating.  My husband ordered fettuccine Alfredo with chichen however he received linguini Alfredo with chicken which was really pricey for the quality of food.  I ordered chicken parm and received a dark,  burnt, piece of breaded chicken covered in sauce.  Neither had a good taste.  My son ordered wedding soup and salad which he was happy with.  Our salads we received at the best art of our meal was in tiny bamboo type bowls.  The lettuce tasted as though it hadn't been washed and had the biggest piece of lettuce I had ever seen.  I was pretty disappointed to say the least.  The cook could be heard dropping F bombs after clearly hurting himself."}
