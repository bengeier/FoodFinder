{"text":"The food is authentic Lebanese fare but is the most delicious I've had in Montreal. Prices are very reasonable and staff are very nice. When you sit down and order a meal ( I suggest the platter for two with taouk, kafta, filet mignon and haloubie - out of this world), they bring you free cold tapas. They aren't big on advertising or fancy decor but they don't need to be. Regulars will always go back and once you go there, you'll go back too."}
{"text":"Nice sandwiches. Nice hummus with beetroot. Great service. Not a fancy place but good enough for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Super authentic and good quality food! And the service is very friendly. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"You don't come here to see a forest scene like in the mountains of Lebanon.  You don't come here to see the rich and famous.   You come here for the FOOD!   I have enjoyed Lebanese food all over the world and have dropped many hundred dollars for a meal    But guess what?  If you are looking for lovely food for next to nothing and if you do not mind sitting in a relaxed but not luxurious dining area, this is the place for you!  There are so many empty tables!   There is no reason for that.  Trust me.  I wish the owners well, they make and cook their food very well!  I am going agAin on Monday."}
{"text":"A good casual Lebanese restaurant across from \"Marché Central\". I came here for a group lunch for the holidays at noon on a Saturday and the place was empty with our reserved table the only one setup (we were a group of 15). The place is big enough and could accommodate much larger groups.  The place is actually a very good choice for groups since the prices are reasonable and they offer large mixed plates of brochettes for sharing. The place is equally good if you are by yourself as it is really a simple place where you can get a quick byte or take your time and enjoy the good quality food.  Everything was excellent form the appetizers (pita bread, olives, hummus, salad), mixed grilled (kebab, chicken, kafta) to the dessert and turkish coffee. Notable is a appetizer of spiced raw beef (a version of tartare, could not find it on the menu however so you should ask).  Service was affable and attentive. They have wine, beer and Arak."}
{"text":"The food was OK The bread was not too fresh and the shish taouk is really small. I know much better than that. And it's more expensive then other places"}
