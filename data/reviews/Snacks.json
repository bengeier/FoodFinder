{"text":"We came here for lunch a few weeks ago before heading over to the Picasso exhibit. I like the decor of the place and the fact that it's a great place for lunch that won't break the bank at the Bellagio. I had the tuna sandwich with wasabi mayo and my boyfriend had the foraged mushroom pesto pizza. I loved the tuna sandwich. My boyfriend liked the foraged mushroom pizza but thought they could have added a variety of fancy mushrooms to warrant the word \"foraged\" in the name and to make it taste better. There was only one type of mushroom in the pizza originally.  He brought up his suggestion to the manager there and she then had him speak to the chef.  We weren't sure if anything was going to be done about it but we found out today that they now have a variety of mushrooms in their foraged mushroom pesto pizza! It's good to know that the management really takes the patrons' suggestions to heart. Thus, the 5 star rating. We also appreciate the great customer service and the nice, clean environment of Snacks."}
{"text":"Katsu burger makes this restaurant a 5! Delicious! Garlic sweet potato fries- great pair with the katsu burger!"}
{"text":"The chicken caesar wrap was good!!

I'd recommend double checking the leaves in the salad before eating..."}
{"text":"Good spot for quick fast food style food (burgers, pizzas nachos etc) if you're not looking for buffet style at Bellagio. Overpriced but that's to be expected for where it's located."}
{"text":"Takes for forever!!! Do not go here, 30 minutes for breakfest sandwich, just go to a buffet"}
{"text":"Ordered wings and a pretzel. Could barely hear the cashiers as they took our order.

It wasn't busy, but our food took forever to show, 15 minutes or more. My wings sat on the counter a good five minutes before they realized my order was up. She pulled a pre-made pretzel out of a bin and passed it back to have it heated up...

Wings were like jerky, driest wings I've ever had, and not spicy (they were supposed to be). Pretzel tasted like bread shaped like a pretzel. It didn't even taste like a pretzel, just bread."}
{"text":"To save money.. This is your best option at the Bellagio, try the salmon sandwich it I'd the best.. Don't add any drink.. You always want to come to this place with your drink.."}
{"text":"Snacks! Exactly that. Adult dinner price for kids meal sized burgers. Ordered a Salad which was more filling than the burger."}
{"text":"I loved their cheese and ham breakfast sandwich - but the bacon one broke my heart.  They add a weird flavor to their bacon so instead of the usual heavenly smoky taste you get this unrecognizable rude awakening with every bite.  Dude, it's bacon: delicious enough as it is - leave it the hell alone! 

I also loved the fruit bowl - every single piece of fruit was ripe and tasty.  Coffee also exceptionally good - then again Bellagio coffee is generally great - so it's not exclusive to this one outlet.  Prices could be lower but when you see their to-go containers you'll understand where your money is going!  It's like they're packing a takeout meal for the White House.   

Their burger was absolutely horrible: completely burned the first time and on the second attempt they forgot half the ingredients I'd requested.  The unburned version didn't taste that much better either!  Their fries are really delicious though. 

The place is too small for the traffic it seems to have, and AC is too high for my liking, but it is SUPER convenient and a great option if you want to grab a quick bite, whether it's breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Go in with low expectations and save yourself a bank breaking and belly aching trip to the buffet!  

Okay, rant over."}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken sandwich I have ever had! Every time I am in Vegas I go to this restaurant at least once to get my chicken sandwich fix. Service can be a little slow and seats can be limited but for the chicken sandwich it's worth the wait. Prices are also great for the strip and the Bellagio."}
{"text":"For being in Bellagio this place is horrible. I highly don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"The line at the buffet was a little long and I didn't wanna spend $27.99 for breakfast so I came here to save some gambling money. Big mistake. First, I hate it when a restaurant that doesn't have waiter service has a \"tip\" section on their receipts. What am I tipping for? I crossed out the section and I always feel like I'm getting poorer service because of it.. maybe it's me...
I ordered a berry bowl and something called a \"so cal\" - which is basically eggs and kale. The berry bowl was full of u washed berries and leaves. The \"so cal\" took 20 minutes to make. Won't make this mistake again."}
{"text":"This is a great place for family and kids, great variety in food and different drinks. Having the hours they stay open and being able to have breakfast lunch and dinner at anytime is a great thing!"}
{"text":"Do not eat here. Waited for 15-20 minutes for a slice of pizza. 13 people working and most are standing around."}
{"text":"We were running late for a show and wanted to get something quick so we popped in here.  We were able to get in and out very quickly - having had two top notch cheeseburgers in the midst of it.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's ok. Greasy food. Good when it's late and nothing else is open, but don't make it a destination."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Tomato soup is fantastic and they have a really rich chocolate shake."}
{"text":"Ugh...

Maybe i'm bias because by the 1390489301th meal at vegas, this place just did not come up to par.  My asian salad was terrible, and the Margherita pizzas were terrible.  Was not impressed whatsoever."}
{"text":"So. . 5 out of 5 times I have gone here. . I have had bad service,  but this last time takes the cake.. so,  I ordered a pepperoni pizza to go for my son ($30) at 10:30pm.. 30+ minutes later, I see the cook taking the pizza out of the oven,  then I see the pizza box sitting at the pass through and one of the counter guys grabs it,  heads to the counter area where the single slices are kept warm,  tosses some slices into the box, then my buzzer buzzes and I pick up the pizza. . Curious,  I open the box and discover that. . I wasnt given a whole pepperoni pizza.. somewhere between the pizza oven and the window,  1/3 of my pizza disappeared. .and the counter guy decided to slop in  random pizza slices to fill the gap. . Who does that? ? I'm paying $30 for a pizza and this guy not only doesn't give a crap,  but figures he can get away with it. . I asked to (once again) speak to the manager,  and she (once again) refunds my money.. my only conclusion is that since this place is right next to a night club full of drunk, hungry people,  they can get away with sleazy maneuvers, and nobody will notice. .. but. . FYI Snacks.. not everyone ordering is drunk and. .if I pay $30 for a WHOLE PIZZA.  I expect to get a WHOLE PIZZA"}
{"text":"Charged $100 for $20 worth of food. Chicken wings were over cooked and you get six for $11 or $12. Nachos were just as bad and were more. Coke was $6. I wasn't expecting anything great but I would expect a little better for the price."}
{"text":"Staff is kind of rude and ignorant. Eating here is definitely a last resort at the Bellagio but I just needed to grab a quick sandwich to go. I ordered a tuna sandwich and it actually was pretty good and I got it quickly so I did achieve my ultimate goal of healthy food to go in a hurry!"}
{"text":"Newly remodeled and reopened a few weeks ago with the addition of a brick oven & updated menu. You order on tablets when you go in. It prints a ticket that you bring to the counter to pay & get your order. Only tried a couple of slices today... Margarita & carne. Although it was a big improvement from previous pizza they still need some work. The menu described the margarita pizza as having buffalo mozzarella & San Marzano sauce. None of that was on it. Not even traditional basil that's always on a margarita pizza. Basically plain mozzarella cheese. The carne was as described but nothing special. Both slices were overcooked..very crunchy... Seemed like if done right the crust would have been light & airy.  Slices are reasonable $6/$7. Whole pizzas around $30....which if I would have got the margarita liked they served, I would have sent it back. I will give it another chance after they're open a couple months."}
{"text":"Wrote this review in the old listing & decided to add to this one. Have tried it a few times since first opening & my thoughts are still the same.

{"text":"Two words... Hot-Dog!  Hot diggity dog that is surprisingly amazing! The toasted bun pushes this ordinary dog over the top. Perfect ending to a long, late night poker session.

Looking forward to trying other items and hoping they don't get rid of the hot dog the way they did my previous go to item for a light bite to eat."}
{"text":"For a small quick bite this place is a gem! Considering it is in the Bellagio prices are actually reasonable $5 for a slice of white pizza (was actually super bomb no lie) and $11 for a tasty and actually pretty healthy grilled chicken sandwich. There is a variety of interesting burgers that I could see people losing their minds over in the early A.M. after tossing back a few. I'm eyeing the katsu burger myself personally. The funny thing is it's the French fries that are actually kind of pricey. $4.50 for a bowl of fresh cut fries I say skip it and get another slice of white pizza!"}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant right next to the main casino area.  It has a nice feel but can get crowded.  It is set up like a fast food type establishment but has some high tech equipment for ordering.  The wait staff were polite and had a good since of humor.  

M Life Military members: For those of us that served in the military almost every restaurant in the Bellagio gave us a 10% discount (it shows Military/Veteran on the M Life Card)

The food was good, we had a double burger with cheese wrapped in lettuce, a regular burger, and to drink one tea and an Adult Chata Shake.  Both burgers were good, I loved the Chata Shake, it was very convenient, and there was no need to make a reservation (it was just under $50 for 2 people).

We would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Las Vegas for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Glad to have found a place that makes fresh food and isn't too heavily priced. We still ended up paying $32.xx for the snack fries with egg and buffalo wings and a soda (refillable), which is pricey in my book. But still its more reasonable than the other restaurants around.

The only reason why I'm giving them 4 stars and not 5 is how salty the wings and fries were. I found myself parched before I even ate and as I was eating, even more desperate for a gallon of water to balance my salt levels. Lol. 

But, flavor was absolutely delicious. They REALLY NEED TO CUT DOWN the SALT. 

OVERALL. convenient, friendly, fast, semi fresh, cheaper than the other expensive restaurants around. Just tell them to ease up on the sodium...enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's a quick and easy way to get a bite to eat at the Bellagio. The food used to be much better.  It's not great and it''s not terrible. It seems that they have cut back on quality.  The price is good for the fact that it is inside the Bellagio.  The operating hours should be longer.  Some nights they close at 11PM, that's way too early for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Pretty tight space with a diner feel.  

Ordered a salted caramel shake.  Was pretty good, but not fantastic.  $7.50 + .62 tax = $8.12.  Expensive, but as expected at a nice hotel."}
{"text":"Cute lil eatery right at the entrance of the lobby at Bellagio. We went here because we needed a quick bite before the O Cirque show, which was conveniently located right around the corner. The food was delicious! I had the philly cheesesteak , which came with a side of chips and a juicy pickle! The cheesesteak was awesome! Tender, juicy and huge. I only finished half of it. It was about $10 total. Can't beat that at The Bellagio. 

It's quick, it's decently priced, has a great variety,  filling food, and tastes great!"}
{"text":"Hard to find, as it is tucked away on the north end of the casino, this is a great place for a quick meal on the go.  I especially like the Cuban sandwich, which contains the holy trinity of pork, ham and pickles."}
{"text":"I was pleased with the speed & choices offered for a quick meal.  Almost everything in the hotel requires sit down dinners and we didn't have time for that so it was nice to find this place.  The menu had nice variety, the food was fast and tasty.  It's not fast food fast but quick enough for a pre-show bite or quick sit down.  I had the quesadilla and my husband had a burger with fries.  I actually would have liked to try a few other things!"}
{"text":"Food was very good and met expectations, but the ordering and queuing system can be a little stressful and confusing when placing and picking up orders.  Stay away from the pretzels because they are horrible."}
{"text":"So, I've been here plenty of times, and it never ceases to please! The latest time being just yesterday! So here goes the review!

So I used to live in Vegas, and this spot was one of my favorites, it's good, fast, and it's at the Bellagio! We were in Vegas over this last weekend, and as I'm trying to nurse my hangover yesterday morning, I see \"SNACKS\" whoohooo! I ordered the BLT with cole slaw, freakin delicious! Perfectly toasted sourdough bread with bacon lettuce and tomato. I love their BLT, I'd go back just for this alone! 

The place is small, and it's usually busy, you order at the counter and wait for your food. It's a pretty spot, not a lot of seating. It's next to the sports book section so you can grab your food to go and watch it in the sports book section. They've got mainly sandwiches with pretty sides, they also have chicken wings, which I haven't yet tried.

In a hotel where most of the meals are 5 stars, this post is nice to just pop in and grab a quick bite. I love coming here!"}
{"text":"I was actually pretty surprised with this place. Consider it's on the strip, at the Bellagio, and you're looking for something quick to eat and that won't cost an arm and a leg.  At snacks, it's not just candy bars and potato chip bags.  You have creative burger and pizza items alongside some pretty awesome french fry variations.

First, to save time, the menu selection is a touchable screen before you approach the cashier.  It gives you your options of what you would like to have included or removed from your item.  For example, a lot of the burgers come with it's specific ingredients to make for a pretty good burger.  For the socal burger, don't forget to include the kale which is part of the burger.  The combination of the chile and the kale with a unique bun make it a treat, a good treat.  The pizza is not your all time greatest pizza but it's much much better pizza than what you find at those mall pizza spots.  Ugh, I can't stand those!

Pricing? Much more affordable than stopping at any of the restaurants off the strip, especially among any of the other food spots at the Bellagio.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND, if you're at the Bellagio and you can't wait to go anywhere else or walk another half mile anywhere for food, and you want to save some money and make it quick so you can catch up with your spouse, friend, group, whatever, definitely stop by Snacks.  You can find it when facing the Bellagio, it's on the north side near Flamingo road and the valet by the casino and the fancy jewelry windows.  Keep an eye out, you'll find it."}
{"text":"This food reminds me of stuff from the cafe at my local zoo.  I expected more from the Bellagio, even if it's just a quick bite, given the higher prices.  Better options are available at other casinos.  

The only reason why we ate here was because we would have been late to \"O\"."}
{"text":"Since I was craving fries and a snack.  It's the only thing open 24/7 in the Bellagio.
We ordered the Korean chicken wings, salt and pepper fries, and the pork belly fries.

I loved the Korean chicken wings and fries.  Not a big fan of the pork belly fries, though.

I liked the ordering process the most! Touchscreen monitors to order what you wanted before you proceed to the cashier. It's fool proof."}
{"text":"BBQ Pulled Pork sliders with a side of slaw.  OMG - so good.  Not too tangy.  Perfect with not too creamy cole slaw.  Hubby had an amazing chicken wrap.  I should have ordered that. 

Snacks is a perfect little stop for a 'cheaper' meal in Vegas, or just a, well, snack.  Soups, chili, burgers, salads - lots of business goes to the folks stopping by for a little something before heading back to the Sports Book next door.

Great little place."}
{"text":"Had the chicken pita with cheese fries and that was pretty good. The philly cheese steak is also a great pick since its big. The soups weren't too great though, but overall to have something quick is a good place to go."}
{"text":"Love Snacks!

The selection of food is impressive. The quality is great. Yes, the price seems a little high, but it's in a convenient location in the casino and you don't have to go out to the strip to get it. Definitely worth it.

My go-to is the all beef hot dog. They also have some street type tacos that are to die for.

There's usually plenty of seating, and it's kept fairly clean."}
{"text":"Great place to go for a quick bite! Although its a bit overpriced, its a no frills kind of place. I always get the fruit bowls to go!"}
{"text":"Apparently the most affordable meal in Bellagio, yet totally overpriced, mediocre fast food. The burger was OK. The fries were lukewarm and stale; they'd obviously been sitting under a heat lamp. Portions were NOT generous at all. The McDonald's down the street probably has better food for a third the price."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick meal. We liked being able to order exactly what we wanted off the touch screen. My boyfriend got a burger and I got a slice a pizza. Not the largest selection of food choices but the food was good. Staff Zach was great!! Very friendly and helpful! We sat next to a few other people and actually had a good conversation with them while waiting on our food. Glad we stopped in!"}
{"text":"With little or no time left before I had to head to see \"O\", I grabbed a quick bite at Snack Bar. I got a bit nervous at first because the line was so so so long, but it move very quickly. They must have it down to a science. You are in and out (ordering your food that is) within ten minutes. Pretty good for a non-fast-food eatery. The only down size of it being so packed, was that there was really no place to sit. Thankfully, I got my order just as a couple was leaving, so I was able to sit for five minutes to scarf down my food. Speaking of the food. It was decent. Not the worst, but defiantly not the best (especially in this town). I had a simple grilled chicken with salsa and guacamole. The chicken was a bit dry and spicy and the guacamole was average."}
{"text":"We were supposed to eat at the Bellagio Buffet, but we weren't hungry enough to forfeit $30/person. Plus, we weren't compelled to stuff $30 worth of food down to our stomach, and didn't want the extra million calories of kobe beef, sushi and carb galore. Around the corner we bumped into this cute \"snack bar.\" The menu is small so it was easy to pick. Anyways, we ordered the pulled bbq sandwich, club sandwich and an order of chef salad to split between us. three words - TOO MUCH food. Our bill came out to $30 (thank goodness we didn't eat at the buffet). We assumed the proportion would be small, hence 3 plates for 2 people. We were wrong, the pulled bbq sandwich is a plate of 3 huge stuffed pork sliders, the sandwich was about a foot long and the salad (looked like a side salad) had a lot of fixings and was overflowing The salad was topped with tomato dressing, which sounds weird and looks like pizza sauce, but it complimented the chef salad really well. First time trying tomato dressing and it was good. The cole slaw was good. The sandwich/burger came with a slice of pickle (yes!), and my potato chips looked like it was from the bottom of a large potato chip bag (small and crumble-y) which was okay b/c i wouldn't have been able to finish 'em. 

Anyways, check out this place, and it is Vegas so don't expect a $6.00 sandwich, minimum was $9.00 a plate. I cant complain about the price of drinks, b/c i ordered a cup of water (free). 

Their cookies looked tempting but we were way too full to even think about dessert. 

We got here before the crowd. So, it took about 5 minutes for our food to arrive, and didn't have to hunt down a table. Small eatery, so not a lot of seating.

If you're going to complain about pricing in Vegas, go down the street and hit up McDonald's or In-n-Out. :)

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"This wasn't my best eating experience while in Vegas. Not everything was listed on their men, so if you want a plain bagel, just ask and they can make it for you. I found it to be a little over priced for what it was, though, which was a little frustrating since they didn't have everything on their menu, meaning they didn't have all of their prices listed on the menu. 
The location is nice. It's towards the middle of the casino, which is in the middle of the strip. If you're passing by and need a quick bite to eat,this could be a good place. 
The line was long, but it did move quickly. I went on a Wednesday during a pretty crowded time, and seating was scarce. Though we did find a place to eat eventually. 
The workers were nice and it was a pretty snack bar-type place, so I would try it again if I was at the Bellagio and wanted a quick snack or breakfast to take with me somewhere, however I would not go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"Super solid short-order choice, just try not to go late-night when the line can get long.
Very delicious lentil soup, Chicken gyro, and salad options.
You think it might be the same food as the buffet / room service, but it's actually slightly better.

Take a look at other people's food as you walk in, and you will be sure to see something appealing. IF you end up here late-night, it's a pretty fun people-watching spot. Just realize that it may be 30-40 minutes between walking-in and taking your first bite (as opposed to 5-10 minutes in the middle of the day.)

Need hot sauce? Just ask for it - they've got different kinds in to-go packets under the counter."}
{"text":"When I first got to Vegas this was the first place I ate at. I wasnt in the mood for sit down and fancy dining. I was more on the grab and go type food. A little pricey but the food was great. I had a Philly Cheesesteak and a Chicken Gyro. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"I felt compelled to do this review as I feel the current rate definitely doesn't do it justice. I have walked by here more times than I can count and finally I'm glad to have found a gem that is right near my favorite slot with some actually great food.

I decided on the BLT which I took to go and ate in my room. The bacon was amazing and partnered with the rest of the sandwich just really made me feel elite when the last bite was consumed. The portion size was a lot more than I expected and the bacon was actually quite thick and not your rinky dinky slice of pig.

I'm certainly curious to see what more they have to offer and definitely bestowed my faith again in Bellagio dining establishments!"}
{"text":"We wanted to get something quick before the O show; and since Bellagio really has no options for that we settled for Snacks. We ordered the burger, sweet potatoes fries and pork belly nachos. Do NOT get the pork belly nachos. Very tasteless and the chips are stale. It's a nice place but not worth the wait and the price. I would put your walking shoes on and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"There's something going to the beach and gambling have in common: they both get you famished!

In need of some sustinance, STAT, we headed to the nearest food spot, which happened to be very close to the Bellagio craps tables - Bellagio Snacks. 

Leave it to the Bellagio to bring a snack shack type place up a notch. We decided to share a pizza and an order of the cheese fries. I don't know what it was about them, but those cheese fries were amazing. Truly! Yes I was starving (and likely hung over), but the salty, melty, hot cheese they used was special. 

The refillable soda option was also nice, since we could take our cups to-go as we milled around the casino floor. 

A solid choice for some quick, unhealthy eats. I'll be back for the cheese fries - that's for sure."}
{"text":"If all you want is a burger and/or pizza, for the love of all that's holy, get out of this hotel and go anywhere else! The burger was no better than a Big Mac but here at the Bellagio, it costs $9.50!!!"}
{"text":"came through in a pinch with healthy fresh fruit. Nuff said"}
{"text":"My friend and I ended up at the Bellagio (we were staying at the Imperial Palace - helloooo, culture shock!) because he'd read that Olives had a decent vegetarian selection, which they most certainly did not.  Unwilling to throw down serious money but still wanting late lunch, we stumbled upon Snacks.

I would like to note that this is not really a snack bar.  Grilled veggie sandwiches and caramel hazelnut brownies are not snacks, especially when the brownie is SIX DOLLARS.  The veggie sandwich, though, is darn good, and big.  A side of fries was pretty cheap, and the portion was generous.  The plates are plastic and if you need to take half your sandwich with you, they give you a lid that fits right over the plate.  I was extremely impressed.  We also got cookies to eat later.  The peanut butter one was decent, but the oatmeal raisin was great.  Shoulda bought one for the ride home..."}
{"text":"Something to grab pass midnight. The the spicy wings, pepperoni pizza and a pork nachos. Wings had a good spice, lack of flavor in the pizza (dipped pizza in wing sauce). Pork nachos were too creamy... can't complain much at 3am though."}
{"text":"Really great burgers and pizza. I was shocked a round the clock little place like this could crank out such great food. Service was also awesome. Definitely recommend it for a quick bite.Bonus... drinks are free refills."}
{"text":"Pork Nachos were delicious. Mild wings had a bit of a kick to them. Also delicious.  Classic burger was okay and the chicken burger was good.  Both burgers were very small.  Took very little time to get our food.   Which was great since we needed to get to a show."}
{"text":"Almost ordered everything on the menu already. The price is OK for Bellagio. I think ordering food here is slow. So I always call ahead of time to order food & go and pick it up. At times they have messed up my order or not even put it in. Grr =T They daily specials are sometimes good but it's cheaper then the regular stuff by a dollar or so. They just mix the meat and sauce up hehee. 

Favor is the salmon stuff, like the salmon wrap or salmon burger etc."}
{"text":"YUM!!! I know it's just grab and go fast food but Snacks is a winner in my book! My boyfriend and I visit Vegas yearly and are always looking for new food spots. One day we were at the Bellagio playing poker and someone had mentioned getting Snacks for lunch when I decided to give it a try. I was able to pay for the food with points I had earned playing and they delivered it right to the table for me. During my time in Vegas, I tried the steak quesadilla and the chicken quesadilla and both were delicious. I also tried the Asian chicken salad which was the best! The food was very good and the customer service was great! I will return on my next visit!!"}
{"text":"So my girlfriend a day I were in Vegas for a conference. We were looking for a quick place to eat and heard about this place.. Oops wrong choice .

We ordered 3 pizzas between the two of us and a sweet potatoe fries. The pizza was served cold and tasted stale. We couldn't take it so the third pizza we sent back and requested it to be heated. They did and they gave us a new hot piece.. So we were happier, but the pizza was still a solid OK.  The fries were super greasy and we couldn't finish them. 


Blah"}
{"text":"We love to watch games and gamble at the Bellagio Sportsbook, so we have enjoyed several meals over the years at Snacks.  The chicken wrap is my favorite thing---yumm!  Served with chips or coleslaw and a pickle.  It is sooooo good!  We have also enjoyed the clam chowder, cheesesteak, and onion rings (although, not as good last Sunday).  

Give it a Pass-The breakfast sandwich- Boring.  The wait for the food can be a bit long.  Not sure why when there is not always a crowd!

I love this place-  good food, affordable, and easy!"}
{"text":"Their margherita pizza is excellent 4.5/5
Burger was ok 4/5
Fries did not like. 2.5/5
Drinks way too expensive"}
{"text":"We didn't have enough time for a sit-down dinner before catching a show at the Bellagio and stopped in at Snacks.  My friends ordered the sliders and cuban pork sandwich.  The sliders were delicious and though the sandwich wasn't made traditional-style, it was still pretty good.  You have your choice of cole slaw or potato chips.  I ordered the steak tacos - they took a while to arrive, but were very light and flavorful.

If you're looking for a quick eat, I highly recommend Snacks.  Most of the menu items were around $10, with hearty portions."}
{"text":"We needed a quick bit before we went for O the snack fries with braised beef were unreal! Bit expensive but hey it Vegas!"}
{"text":"Everything here is good. Nothing here is inexpensive. I frequent this place since I like the Bellagio sportsbook. My favorite here is the cheeseburger. It is over 10 bucks and I think it comes with chips and a pickle. One of the best burgers I have had and the value is not bad when come to think of it. They cook it to your liking. It does take awhile to come out. Service here is slow but I don't mind. Even the clam chowder takes awhile. From what i remember it is 4 bucks.

I am pretty wasted from the free drinks( which are high quality) to even worry about the wait. Gambling booze and good food what more can I ask for when I am in Vegas"}
{"text":"The fruit cup was DELISH!
Well priced for a lot of fruit. 

This little place is the perfect idea. Not really hungry for a meal but you want something.
Step right in and take a seat at the big bar. Soup, sandwiches, pizzas, fruit, or pastries. Affordable and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is really delicious and is the perfect place for a quick lunch or a random snack.  The salmon sandwich is flavorful and cooked perfectly, the iced tea is brewed to perfection, and  the chips are crunchy, salty, and delicious.  I went here after I got to the hotel and was waiting for my room to be ready (we checked in early).  It didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Are you expecting reasonable prices inside the Bellagio? No? Good...

Now that that is out of the way, the food here is decent. I have had the longhorn chili which was decent. It's a no-bean chili, good spice. Cornbread that comes with it is bland. Seriously? How do you mess up cornbread? I've also had the steak soft tacos. They are the typical 4\" diameter tortilla with enough filling to belong on a 6\" tortilla. So you inevitably look like a moron trying to eat them and having meat and avocado bits splattering all over.

Pricing is ridiculous. But it frankly isn't Bellagiodiculous. So if you have had three meals at Circo and Noodles and Yellowtail, then Snacks is going to seem positively cheap. You will feel like you're ordering off the dollar menu.

Just don't expect your grandma's cornbread..."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but the service is terrible and the food takes at least 20 minutes to come out..  When the restaurant is slow... I ordered some soup which sat at the window as a mislabeled to go order, until I came and asked if they forgot my order. There's three people eating here... Come on."}
{"text":"I'm just trying to save you from a terrible mistake. We thought this would be a good place for a quick bite. The pizza doesn't even taste like food, the burger was terrible. The loaded fries were the only palatable menu item we tried. Fast service but terrible food."}
{"text":"this snack bar and earl of sandwich have become my go-to restaurants in vegas. casual, non-pretentious, and very tasty. the pressed sandwiches are excellent. i highly recommend trying the pastrami or cuban. you won't be disappointed!! 5 stars if the sandwiches came with fries."}
{"text":"While in Vegas I try to find affordable options for lunch dining. This was a small place with a very simple menu. The food is moderately priced for what it is but it's definitely somewhere I will return."}
{"text":"We paid $22 for a tiny sparkling water, a raspberry iced tea, and 6 non-crispy wings with way too spicy of sauce. 

The pre-order line was a nice idea, but still very slow. When we first walked over, a bunch of the tables were dirty and stacked with dishes. The tables were cleaned before we sat down, but still only felt moderately clean. 

We would not come back here."}
{"text":"Came here to eat after everything else was closed. I ordered the wings and they seemed to be way too spicy! The double burger was very good and so is their pizza! Prices aren't that bad considering it's the Bellagio. Food isn't all that healthy but when nothing else is open it's better than nothing!"}
{"text":"Food: 3/5
Wait: 1/5
Price: $$
Presentation of food: 3/5
Presentation of joint: 3/5
Overall: 3/5

I was craving tacos that night, so I ordered their steak tacos. Boy did they ruin it for me, it was spicy to the point where I did not enjoy eating it anymore. Thank goodness I also ordered their clam chowder soup so I wouldn't be starving, the soup was ok, i drenched it with my oyster crackers. Hubs and I had shared an order of fries (which we did not finish) that was enough to feed three people! He had their club sandwich that had cranberry sauce in it, wasn't really what he was looking for. Overall I would've enjoyed the tacos (came in three btw) much more if they wouldn't drench it with hot salsa. Or at least warn your customer that it's spicy."}
{"text":"The worst establishment I've stepped into in a \"good\" Vegas atmosphere. Extremely disappointed in the service,food, and EVERYTHING. The young man at the counter not only acted arrogant but when told he got the order wrong (my wife is allergic to dairy which was mentioned multiple times) he adamantly stood by what he believed was correct. 20 min later the correct order came out but he decided to put it on the \"heating test\" while I sat at the counter as if a show of defiance. As an end result the meats were not cooked fully, chicken wings as well, and the fries has particles of cheese on them even AFTER taking the order back to correct. Margherita pizza was amazing tho  (I can eat dairy). Will never purchase from establishment again will
Always recommend other places to eat in the future."}
{"text":"This was incredibly convenient and hit the spot. With a name like Snacks, I assumed healthy options would be at a minimum, but I was wrong. There is a new kale quinoa salmon salad available (in fact it's so new that it isn't even listed on the touch screen menu as of yet). It is pre-made, but if you're hungry for something healthy and you can't wait for a sit down meal, this is perfect.

The salmon wasn't the best I've ever had, but the salad itself more than makes up for it. The sun dried tomatoes gave the salad a nice flavor, as did the crushed red pepper and Parmesan cheese available in individual packets at the condiment station.

The staff is friendly, too. I would consider coming back here. I left pleasantly surprised and with a full tummy."}
{"text":"I just needed something cold to drink and Alonso told me about free refills.  This allowed me to chill in the nearby sports book."}
{"text":"Two words: Chicken wrap!!  Crispy pieces of chicken and oh so delicious! 

My bf ordered the club sandwich; I thought it was pretty good.  He didn't like it cause it had a cranberry sweet spread in the sandwich.  It kind of reminded me of a thanksgiving feast in a sandwich!

What more can be said:  its mediocre food for a mediocre price. 
Oh and tip: skip out on the coleslaw, it's nasty.  Opt for the chips instead.  And no substituting French fries (even if you're willing to pay an extra price!!! -2 stars for that)."}
{"text":"The BLT is amazing. (They only have a BELT on the menu, which includes egg. Just ask for a BLT instead.) Four stars for that alone."}
{"text":"Food should be better in a 5 star resort. Pizza was not good and more expensive than 50/50 Pizza next door at Aria."}
{"text":"uhm i get that im in vegas and things cost more...but ROFL WOW. theres a reasonable point in paying for something. 

to be dramatic...its like paying 10$ for a piece of gum."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to grab a quick bite.  Bellagio is nice, and I thought they held everything to a high standard, but Snacks definitely disappointed.  I ended up paying $24 for a salad and some wings.  The salad was wilted, and the wings were premade so they had lost all of their crispiness already.  Definitely come here only if you have some MLife comp points to spare.  Hate to sound like a degenerate gambler but the only advantage is that its quick so you can get back to the tables ASAP.  Besides that, it is incredibly overpriced, and falls way short in quality."}
{"text":"I only recently started coming here to Snacks religiously in the past year when I've been staying here at the Bellagio.  It's a hidden gem right next to The Bank and the sports book and it's a great place to get great food.  The food is relatively affordable (for Vegas) as well.  Great alternative for those that are looking for a quick bite.

Once you get in there are 3 tablets on your right where you can order.  Those that are less tech savvy might take a little longer to navigate through the system but also finding where certain dishes are might take some time as well.  Once you have completed your order a receipt prints out with a bar code that they scan later on at the register.  After you pay they give you a pager and then in about 5-10 minutes later you'll get your food ready to go.  There aren't many tables in the restaurant area itself but it also depends on how busy it is.

The sandwiches are really good here.  I've tried the Big Tuna Burger as well as the Katsu (Chicken covered in panko) sandwich.  Can't go wrong with either.  The Snack Fries with Egg is something that's worth trying, it's fries with gravy and meat and also with an egg on top."}
{"text":"I have tried this convenient spot a couple of times while play poker over at Bellagio. 

The corn chowder was good.

The pork belly nachos were great! 

For just something to just have a great light dinner inside of Bellagio it is very well worth it."}
{"text":"Typical bellagio restaurant. Over priced n below average foods.  Custard milk shake was good but not for 8 bucks b4 tax"}
{"text":"Very cool ordering system. You order from a screen and pay and bring the ticket to the counter where they make the food. Too bad the food itself was a bit lackluster. The pizza was dry, the fries a bit stale, and not much to rave about. It's probably the cheapest option you have at Bellagio though so that itself could be worth consideration. Probably wouldn't come back unless I need a quick bite."}
{"text":"Good wings. Perfect after clubbing definitely hit the spot. Service was good and fast despite its huge crowd from the other people from clubbing. Dankkkk"}
{"text":"Perfect spot if you are hungry and do not feel like walking anymore in search of food.  
Really enjoyed the BLT, very filling.  
Felt like the place is frequented by actual employees of the Bellagio, so that is a good sign.
Should of tried the fries, they looked good. Maybe next time."}
{"text":"This my second time visiting because of convenience and time constraint. However a good choice for a quick bite prior to a business meeting, show or hitting the night clubs at Bellagio. The Snack Fries was quite good and the mushroom pizza slice was okay. However the few times I have been here the service was on point. 

Just a reminder this place can get busy because it's near high traffic areas like the Race and Sport Book, Poker Room, Bank Nightclub and O show theater."}
{"text":"Great spot if your need a quick service meal. Pizza slices are pretty descent but their snack fries is great just right amount of crunch and savory topping. Most times their customer service is on point. However it can get busy depending if there is a large convention in town or patrons for The Bank Night Club next door."}
{"text":"40+ minute wait for a slice of cheese pizza and fries. There was no line when I ordered which means something is seriously wrong in the kitchen"}
{"text":"Pretty solid place option for a quick bite if you are not feeling like going outta the hotel.   You order at the counter and they call your name. The food portion is pretty good. I ordered steak tacos $12 which came with a choice of cole slaw(very generous portion). There were 3 tacos which had generous amount of meat (to my surprise), a slice of avo per taco and salsa tomatoes and some goat cheese. Nommmm

Btw you can upgrade coleslaw or chips to French fries for $3 more but i think it'd be smart not to to save calories for the booze."}
{"text":"Just stayed at the Bellagio this weekend and ate the chef prepared food ... this is not your regular quick food pickup joint. The classic burger with the \"homemade\" Hawaiian bun is ridiculous. The bun is soft and sweet and the combination of meet and toppings makes this burger one of the best burgers on the strip at a great price. You have to get the sweet potato waffle fries. The pizza is awesome as well. This is a great place to eat."}
{"text":"To say that this place is a cluster f&$k is an understatement. To begin with their ordering system is the dumbest thing ever. You order from a computer screen prior to getting to the register to pay. Once you make it to the register the cluster f&$kness only gets worst. There is total chaos in this place. I think a cue ball has more personality than this bunch of winners working here. There people all over waiting to get their food, because of the way you order the food. Once I managed to get to the register and pay, the guy helping me was the least friendly person ever, anywhere in the world. I wasn't that hungry, but because the group I was with wanted something of substance, since we were getting ready to go out in town and explore the true Vegas experience(get white girl wasted), we decided to get some quick food here. The only thing I ordered was a lemon danish, since again I wasn't that hungry. As I am about to pay the guy at the register looked at order and said \"I have to refund you your money, since we ran out of danishes this morning after breakfast\".  The classy piece of work never even tried to apologize. Here is one of my issues here. If you were out of danishes since breakfast, why didn't anyone take the time to take it off the ordering menu? You have to order from basically an iPad. So I just simply said out loud to myself \" man that sucks I don't even get to eat anything\". The choad at the register looked at me and fought not to laugh at me. Stay away this place is garbage."}
{"text":"Yeah. Everything was cold. Cold pizza, cold \"warm\" cookie. Lame pre made salad, at least that's supposed to be cold.

I don't do a lot of bad reviews, but this just turned out to be so bad I had to put it out there as soon as I got up to my room."}
{"text":"First and last of all you can not sell pastorized
Orange juice as fresh squized orange juice when you busted you can not say that's what we have
Your menu clearly says fresh squized orange juice not pastorized so clearly sucked for sure"}
{"text":"We hit up this place for a late lunch while waiting to head to the airport. I ordered the philly cheesesteak sandwich and bf got the steak soft tacos. Add some onion rings and 2 beers for a side.

I thought the cheesesteak was ok. It was fairly large and everything tasted fresh. My boyfriend said the steak soft tacos were good. They came topped with pico and had a side of guacamole.

The onion rings were the best part of the meal....mmmmm is all I have to say about them.

About $40 all together. They have a decent size for a \"snack\" type place, so I will definitely have to go back to try something new next time."}
{"text":"A good option if you find yourself stuck mid strip with Pangs of Hunger.  Wedged in between the new Bank nightclub and the elaborately ceilinged Fix restaurant is a lil' snackbar, mostly frequented by the poker players and sportsbook players around the corner.  The key numbers are $4 for a big pile of awesome onion rings if you just need a little somethin somethin and $12 for a nice hefty Colorado beef burger if you're really hungry.  

The other key numbers are it closes at 11 Su-W, 12 Th F, and 1 Sat.  

So eat first then go do naughty things.  

Oh I saw Mike Tyson here last night.  Big smile on his face.  The guy's huge now, at least 250, he must be lovin those beef burgers five at a time."}
{"text":"In hotel restaurant. You walk through and order or a kiosk and then pay. We had a group of about 12 and somehow about 5 of our orders just got completely skipped. Groups after us started getting their food and even once we asked about it, it still took over 30 min to get our food. We all just ordered breakfast sandwiches so they weren't even cooking anything. No excuse for that poor service."}
{"text":"My ex-g/f takes forever to get ready, I take moments to get drunk.  Combination of the two leaves us hungry before a 10:30 show of \"O\" at the Bellagio.  We ask the nice ticket counter worker where we should eat.  He suggested \"snacks\".  

I admit, I was pretty drunk so I almost balked at his suggestion.  We arrived to find a long line.  The food must be good!  Then again, the line at the local soup kitchen isn't short..............

The g/f had a Cuban Sandwich and I had Buffalo Fingers and Fries. Mine was delicious, hers was awesome.  Then again, I was very drunk so maybe my mind lied about how great her sandwich is.  Next time I roll through the Bellagio I'll have to be sober and give it a try......but I think it was good.

Good prices (Inside the Bellagio mind you) and good food. [boston accent] FOUAH STAHS! [/boston accent]."}
{"text":"Really fast service and great food. A little pricey for burgers and onion rings but you have to realize what hotel you're in. Highly recommend! Will be coming back again for sure"}
{"text":"The best Pita sandwich i have had so far and my friend's say its the best pizza and salmon sandwich they've had so far. Well,they were slightly tipsy(OK!it was vegas),but i bet they were 100% right.
  This place is located right next to The Bank club,and we were starving, as soon as we stepped out,we stepped into this place.The pita sandwich was filled with melted mozzarella cheese,mushrooms, and bell peppers,and it was amazing!!the onion rings were huge but delicious again.All of us ate non-stop because we were starving and the food was addictive.And the result??
 FOOD COMA!!and we had to get back into the club right after eating. We had developed food babies and it was kind of hilarious but painful.We managed to get in the club and dance a bit,but we did get out after an hour.:D It is impossible to dance when you are pregnant with food!!
  This is what happens when you get to eat the best pita sandwich.Do not attempt this act,but do eat here. :) 
  And i have no clue why this place is called snacks when they give a dish which is equal to 2 meals.But it's worth it.So i take back my complaint.

-Smriti"}
{"text":"The pizza here is really good, but what I really like and crave right now is the tropical parfait. It gets busy here, but the line moves quick. The employee here are really friendly. It is right next to the bank night club I believe is what it's call."}
{"text":"This place is great. For a snack bar this might be one of the best anywhere. Everything on the menu is good but the pressed Cuban sandwich is amazing. The chicken wings are also phenomenal. If you are at the poker room, sports book, or the bank nightclub, this is the best fast-food around."}
{"text":"By farrrrrr the best deli or quick eating place in any hotel in Las Vegas. The food is always fresh and fast. The portions are a good size for the price you pay. I had the Colorado Beef Burger and a Roasted Red Pepper soup (special of the day). The soup was great and the burger was very filling and a healthy size for $12. I have had many other of the menu items. The salmon burger and Cuban are highly recommended. I would rather eat at Snacks then the Cafe at Bellagio any time."}
{"text":"My son and I had their burger and then my husband an. I had their wings and both were very good and fresh. It took a while to get but I guess it's because they are making them fresh. I just wished the burger came with fries not potato chips. 
Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"I don't like to give 1 stars but I must in order for this place to improve and others won't come here until it's better. 
We ordered 3 slices of pizza, 2 drinks and small fries, a total of $42 dollars. The pizza was extremely stale, cold to say the least and just ok. The sweet potato fries were dropping in oil. 

The ladies in the front not very customer service oriented. Maybe they were having a bad day...... 

Point here, do not recommend and will not come back."}
{"text":"We wanted to grab a quick to-go meal and found this little gem inside the Bellagio Hotel.  How genius is this place. Orders are automated, using a touchpad you can order just about anything on the menu. I was craving a burger, so that's what I got. I kinda went crazy and started clicking all kinds of options and upgrades just like a kid in a candy store. So after you place your order, all you do is go to the cashier and everything is rung up already, they are there just waiting to take your money. Our wait wasn't long at all, very efficient and packaged well. The self seating area isn't that big, so you may have to wait to swoop in. You gotta have a fast eye though, as soon as seats vacate, there are people ready to pounce. We got to our room and the burger was to die for. Very juicy, but not overly to where the bun gets soaked. Fries were crispy and the onion rings were huge. Definitely a pit stop on my next visit."}
{"text":"Chicken wings were crunchy, but a bit bland. 
Chili cheese fries were okay. 
Clam chowder was okay. 
Margarita and pepperoni pizza was also just okay. 

About $33. Not too bad, considering the generous portions and that we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ok.  But from slow for a place that you order the counter.  Even with just a few people the service at the counter was slow.  And then another wait.  I couldn't help and notice that some people didn't like their food.   Frankly I expected more from the Bellagio."}
{"text":"We were going to see \"O\" at Bellagio and the buffet line was extremely long so we decided to go with a quick bite.  We expected it would be pricey due to Vegas strip prices.  The burger was a bit dried but not too salty.  It's passable.  Pizza was surprisingly better than we thought.  We had some ones where it feels like ketchup smothered on dough.  The kids ate decent enough to hold them over the show."}
{"text":"The best part of waking up is coffee in the cup. During my staycation at the Bellagio, this was the cafe that served coffee in my cup. With the name Bellagio on the paper cup the coffee ought to be good and it was. I could tell that the coffee is truly quality when I am enjoying it without a flavoref syrup. The coffee is $4 plus change. Refills are complimentary. 

  Bellagio Snacks is one of a few cafes inside the beautiful Bellagio. It is near the area where the Esplenade merges with the casino. It shares the same area with the sports book and The Bank.

 The cafe is relatively small. There is a long table with some individual tables. It is a self serve cafe where people order and pick up their food and beverages at the counter. I would like to mention that the employees are friendly.

  Bellagio Snacks serves beverages from coffee to beer. They also serve the coffee shop food that includes soup, sandwiches,  bagels, and cookies. The food was far overpriced and did not look appealing. When I write that the food is overpriced, here are some examples. Soup is $6. Bagels that look like the Starbucks kind are $3.95 plus $1 for cream cheese. And a burger is $10.50. No wonder why a few minutes later, I was checking-in to Johnny Rockets.

  The best part of waking up in the Bellagio is Bellagio Snacks serving me coffee in my cup. Based on high prices, they most likely won't be serving food on my plate.

Yelp 100 Challenge Review 53 of 100."}
{"text":"Everyone's a winner!! 
I stopped for a quick breakfast \"snack\" and was absolutely delighted with \"the #1 Classic\" breakfast sandwich. This was really a breakfast burger with Nueske's bacon substituted for a beef patty. I gotta say, I never missed it. If you are from Wisconsin like I am, you know about Nueske's legendary bacon!Tons of melted cheese paired with a scrambled egg gave me all the protein I will need to lose my ass in the casinos later today. This might have been the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had, and I've had plenty. Prices are about what you would expect for the Bellagio: $10.49 for the sandwich and $4.49 for coffee. This is a nice little casual spot in. High end casino. They specialize in craft burgers here and it really shows in their breakfast sandwich!"}
{"text":"My buddies and I stayed at the Bellagio one weekend and we literally went to Snacks for all of our meals. It started out with us simply just wanting to grab a quick bite to eat before we start drinking. We stumbled upon this place and decided to try it out since it was close to our room. What a game-changing decision that was for us. 

The food was amazing. We had the Double Cheese Burger, Katsu Burger, Wings, Pork Belly Nachos, Onion Rings, and Snack Fries. I highly recommend the Katsu Burger. For only $12-$13, you get four healthy slices of chicken katsu that were perfectly fried between two toasted Brioche buns. I think I had about three of them in one weekend. The Snack Fries were a little too soggy for my taste with the all the gravy, melted cheese, and meat they put on there, but my buddies all enjoyed it very much. 

Definitely stop by here for a quick late night snack to fulfill your drunchies before heading up to your room. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"The food is not good but it is convenient and open late. The pizza was a little better than I thought based on how it looked but so greasy and not worth $6.50 per slice. Yikes!  We also ordered wings and they were so yucky. They were dry and very poor quality. If you want great pizza close by, head over to the Aria and check out Five50 pizza. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Tasty food...but holy moly expensive for the amount that you get. I know it's Vegas, and inside the Bellagio, but the Cafe Bellagio is way fancy schmancier and its the same price as this Snack place, if not cheaper. You don't even get a server or nice napkins for the price that you pay here, lol.
  
The food it good, it does the trick if you are hungry or have the munchies, just get ready to drop some coin here for some quick snacks before hitting the bars/clubs/slot machines or wherever else your night in Vegas will take you."}
{"text":"I finished watching my show and was heading my way back to Aria at 11:00PM. Almost everything was closed and I was really hungry so I divided to grab a quick bite.

I stopped by this store thinking it might be good since there are roughly 10 people in line. And to be honest, there aren't much places open at this time. I tried to order a burger but the guy told me it's gonna be about 25 mins. Well, I understand it might take a while for good burger, so I ordered a slice of pizza because I don't want my significant half to wait to long. 

I waited 15 mins before I was able to order. I told them I don't mind a cold pizza (because I'm walking to my hotel). It took another 20 mins to finally get my pizza, heated. 

By the time I got back to my room, the pizza was still warm. Thank you. But it was the driest pizza I've ever ate you can cut someone with it..."}
{"text":"Great banana chocolate chip muffin period!!! Oh is NOT fresh squeeze but acceptable.this place is clean and service is good. Several tables and a central table for many..."}
{"text":"This llace is ok for a quick bite in the morining... I would have hoped the oj to be fresh, but it isn't!!! They have a pretty good muffin... This is one I always have before leaving Vegas.. Service is ok, the place is clean and they do have several choices for snacks, breakfast... 
Enjoy"}
{"text":"Pulled Pork sliders were so bland I had to add tobasco sauce for flavor. The philly steak was also meh. Too bad we had such limited selections since we had to get a quick bite to eat before the show."}
{"text":"Good food, good quality and fast service, always open late. But way overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Some hearty, fatty, late night snacks before heading up to our room for the night after the plane ride. But way overpriced for very mediocre quality food. $45 for a burger, hot dog, wings, and two slices of pizza Especially the pizza slices -- very small, thin, and lacked sauce and cheese. If the $9.50 burger came with fries, it would have been a slightly better deal, as well as the pizza being a little bigger/thicker and more decadent with more sauce/cheese. Paying for food is never a problem, but not for dinky little items. I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the hot dog. A thicker hot dog, personally reminded me of the 1/4 lb. beef hot dogs from Wawa's, and a sturdy, toasted bun. 

Extremely nice workers, very pleasant and helpful. Have plenty of condiments available (mayo, ketchup, mustard), packets of relish, salt/peppers, napkins, and plastic utensils. 

Also love that you can order at the self- kiosks and pay for it at the register. 

Around 11:30 PM, it was pretty empty in there, so it was peaceful and quiet waiting for our food. A steady flow of people came to get food/dine- in, as it's the only 24 hour option I believe within the hotel (?) Cute lighting, lots of wooden tables, a wall of faux chalkboard writing, a bar seating that looks out into the casino, 

Definitely worth coming here for a quick late night snack, but I would personally only stick to a hot dog and maybe a chocolate shake."}
{"text":"As others have said I was looking for a quick meal at the Bellagio. Very happy that I found it. The KFC (Korean fried wings) were delicious! Had a piece of the Carne pizza as well and was quite please. Less than $20 for dinner at the Bellagio....didn't know that was possible!"}
{"text":"If you want something quick late at night, this is your only option at the Bellagio without leaving the property.  Unfortunately, they always seem to have a good line and are not super fast at preparing your food.  It's not a very easy grab and go.

That being said, the food is pretty good.  Get it to and take it back your room if you don't want to eat in the small dining room.  

If you don't want to wait, or want more options, take the tram to the Monte Carlo where they have a 24 hour food court with know fast food joints.  It might actually be quicker, have more options, and be less expensive."}
{"text":"This is a surprisingly good snack bar near the poker room and sportsbook at Bellagio.  First of all, it is not cheap for your typical short order/burger/sandwich joint.  But, you're at Bellagio, which isn't known for it's specials.  Also, the food is good, so even though it's a casual setting, you'll get better than average food.

I've had more than one soup du jour, and been pleased every time.  On my last visit, I had the Cuban sandwich.  It's a classic pressed Cuban with ham, roasted pork, cheese, mustard, and pickles.  It comes with a side of chips, or you can upgrade to French fries.  The best thing about this sandwich was the roasted pork.  It was tender, juicy, and delicious.  They ought to make a sandwich solely out of this pork.  The potato chips are kettle style, which is the best style.

As other yelpers note, this place can get crowded at night.  So, be advised.  But, Bellagio doesn't have a ton of quick bite options, so Snacks is bound to be popular because it's the only place that fills this need.  The bonus is you get good food as well."}
{"text":"They had the worst personal pizza ever. This place is a straight rip off, you're better just going to grand lux and have a decent, nice meal than this place while spending just $3-5 extra."}
{"text":"Wanted to get out of Caesars for a bit. After walking a short distance in the awesome summer heat Vegas has to offer, we decided to go into the first place we saw to eat. 

So glad we did! Don't let the \"snacks\" part of the name degrade what they serve here. We got the Salmon sandwiches with a side order of fries. Totally fairly priced (for strip standards) and best salmon sandwich I've ever had... EVER. Fries were also perfect but cole slaw was a little peppery for my taste. 

If you're nearby, I would suggest stopping here; you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"They make good food but the burgers a little intense on the onion. A little lame that when buzzed you need to go get your food after dropping $20 on fries and burger. Very clean establishment."}
{"text":"I honestly thought the food was good. The pork belly nachos were a good twist and very original! Wings were hot and crispy! Definitely a good place for snacks. I tried the adult spiked shakes with Jack and I'm so in love! Thank goodness it's in Bellagio!"}
{"text":"this place is good for a quick bite that will will satisfy your hunger. They have a portobello sandwich that is good and the cheese fries are also wonderful. The prices are reasonable for the Bellagio, I think almost everything is under 12 bucks."}
{"text":"It's getting three stars because of the PRICES!

A water doesn't need to be 6.50! This company needs to be embarrassed. Water comes from the earth, not from a huge company making processed beverages, so prices for alcoholic drinks need to be 6.50 not A WATER! Calm down on prices!! It's getting really pathetic.

My hot dog was 9.00, and it comes with chips (and you get no choice of chips) and some chili sauce. Was the food good? Yeah but not worth these prices. A meal like this should have only cost 9.00 dollars, water included. 

This small meal was 16.00! They are taking advance of people and their money."}
{"text":"This should be a 3.5 star review, but I don't think it's quite a 4 - hence the 3. I went here the day that my wife and I got married (4/23/12) while I was wasting some time waiting for her to get through at the salon. I ordered the Cuban sandwich and a coke. It was $14 - a little expensive for a sandwich and a fountain drink - but it IS the Bellagio, after all. The Cuban sandwich was pretty good; not the best I've ever had, but definitely not the worst either."}
{"text":"The ordering system here is less to be desired.  The touch screens are barely responsive and resulted in multiple errors in our order.  The staff quickly rectified the issue and apologize multiple times.  Front line employees should not have to take the brunt for someone's bad decision to cut corners with implementing the touch screen order system.  Thank you to the employees, assistant manager and manager for quickly resolving the issue."}
{"text":"21 minute ticket time for 2 slices of pizza and French fries(all of which were already made) not sure what took so long because they weren't warm when we got them. Reminded me of a college cafeteria. If you want food, you will get it. Just cold and it'll take a little while. Not spectacular"}
{"text":"Ugh... This was one of those meals that I'd like to forget ever happened. After a night out in Vegas, I stopped at Snacks to grab some food before heading to bed. It's a quick option that's open all night in the Bellagio.

I got an order of wings and fries, which was ready in about five minutes. After the first bite I had to drink almost a whole bottle of water from how salty it was. I literally only took two more bites before just forgoing the entire dish. They literally must have dipped these wings in salt three times before serving it. I can't even tell you if the sauce was good because it was so salty I couldn't taste anything else.

I see no benefits of coming here unfortunately, unless it's the middle of the night, you're starving and need something quick to eat. If that's the case, grab a slice a pizza instead, which is also served here."}
{"text":"Worst pepperoni pizza ever. Ever.

Hot food, served very hot.  That's the end of the good news.

Crust was almost spongy, not crisp.  Cheese was certainly hot and melted, but tasteless.  The too few pepperoni slices were very thin and lack good pepperoni flavor.

Almost any frozen pizza from a grocery store would be a substantive step up."}
{"text":"This cute cafe is tucked away in the Bellagio Casino between Fix and the Sports Book and straight across is the Bellagio Esplanade."}
{"text":"Cute cafe, seemed like a good lunch idea until it took 20 minutes to get our food. Seems like everyone in the hotel uses this place for takeout, so plan to wait a while for your food."}
{"text":"I really ENJOYED my veggie sandwich from here.  Its no frills and straight up.  You order at the counter, sit down, and then wait for your number to get called and then get your GRUB on.  it was hearty and delicous.  Accompanied with a dill pickle!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Came out fast. But of course had Vegas strip prices. $18 for a chicken sandwich and fries"}
{"text":"Some of the worst food I have had, EVER! For two we paid $30 for a measly sandwich and chips. My husband didn't like his pastrami sandwich. No flavor. I had the turkey sandwich with chips. The chips were great, the only good thing in that place. The turkey although fresh was dry, tasteless and not worth the price. I had to drown my food in mayo and mustard. The pickle on the side was a baby pickle. Wont go here again."}
{"text":"Great for a quick bite to eat. Good pizzas and sandwiches. Prices are fair. Not much else to say."}
{"text":"The food is GOOD
The price is a little high.
Quality is good though, sandwiches were tasty big pieces of smoked bacon.
Had some onion rings, they were not sloppy and greasy,they were light and golden.
Salads were good.
Its like a mini cafe inside Bellagio. 
I give 3 stars only cause of the price. Its basic food, but of course its inside a casino so its gonna cost."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my chicken philly pita.  It was not the best but not the worst.  Was one of the only places around where you could get a quick sandwich."}
{"text":"The by the slice pizza was some of the best I have had on the strip. Customer service was great and it was quick."}
{"text":"Really busy but cheaper to get a burger here than at the cafe and its the same quality, worth it. Their coleslaw was not sweet though, nor was their orange juice, unlike the OJ at the Buffet. Clam chowder is cheap and Onion Rings are huge."}
{"text":"The worst food I had during my stay. Incredibly over priced, slow, and the photos are not even close to what your food will look like. Better off going to McDonald's, seriously."}
{"text":"Great place for a burger or pizza. Ordering on the touch screen then having to go to the register anyway doesn't seem to save time. It's still kinda slow."}
{"text":"Above avg quick cafe. We usually stay at the Bellagio and end up eating here twice a trip. I haven't had anything that I absolutely love and never had anything that I hated. What you see is what you get. Nothing great, everything avg and above. Take a look at the menu before you go in."}
