{"text":"Every time we come out to spring training we like to try new places. We wanted a quick bite and this places sure hit the spot! I got a carne asada quesadilla and it was big with lots of meat. Pico, guacamole, and sour cream were on the side. Delicious! Chips and salsa were great too!"}
{"text":"I went in on a weekday evening around 5. It was empty and I ordered a beef chimichanga meal to go with a side of chips and salsa. They clearly made it fresh because it took a few minutes. The chimichanga was perfect, the rice and beans were very authentic (surprisingly difficult to find) and I used the salsa for days afterward. The lady was very nice and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great food. Owner is wonderful. She made sure we were happy. Quality of food is excellent. Prices very fair for what you get. Definately  recommend. I had the special hot burrito. Steak was so tender!"}
{"text":"Must say. I just read the review by Rob and completely disagree. Food was hot and fresh and lots of flavor. I got the two Carnitas combo with rice and beans. Beans were not watery but thick and fresh. Not greasy. If you \"eat in\" they give complimentary chips and salsa. I will be back. Keep it fresh. Keep it local."}
{"text":"Outstanding mexican food. Been here 4 times this week for lunch."}
{"text":"I am picky when it comes to burritos as good ones are hard to find in the East Valley.  I started off with the free chips and salsa which will usually set the tone for how the food will taste.  Chips were good and salsa was home made and tasty.    Burrito came which I ordered the carne asada with rice, beans, cheese, sour cream.  The tortilla was done perfect and the burrito was tasty.  I will definitely go back but round one was good.  You never know if a different cook alerts the taste.  To be continued......"}
{"text":"Small nice restaurant! it is a shame was kinda empty. I was the only one inside other than the restaurant staff. Delicious food, though! Carne assada burrito rocks! I also had some chips (for free if you dine in) and guacamole, which were great as well! Definitely will come back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I won't be going back. When I order a carne asada burrito that costs in the $6 range I expect something at least slightly substantial. What I received was a burrito the size of a .50 cent microwave burrito. I literally thought they'd made a mistake when they handed me my bag, it was so light I thought they'd put salsa and napkins in the bag and forgotten the burrito. I took it anyway. What a fool. I figured, \"well, this will hold me over for a little while at least, hopefully it's good.\" Hahaha! What a joke this burrito was! It was a bean and rice burrito with maybe 1/2 an ounce of meat sprinkled on! I instantly started wishing I'd gone to Wendy's, and the last thing that I wanted at that point was fast food but anything would have been better than this place!"}
{"text":"I come to here from Tucson i was starving I stopped here for lunch I was very pleased with my lunch i have the best burrito al pastor they have the best red salsa mmmmm yummy they also bring chips and salsa to your table  I definitely will came back money very well spend"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Mexican food this is not the place!  My rice and beans were cold, my kids fries were warm, the taco shells appeared to be store bought and the meat for the chimichangas looked like they were from a can.  I won't be back again.  The Agua de horchata was good."}
{"text":"On my way back from leaving Home Depot and I saw this Burrito place and decided to stop. It was a little after noon on a Monday and there was literally one other person in there. I ordered the combination burrito for $6 and was immediately disappointed on its size, in addition to the flavor.. VERY BLAND!! Half way through my burrito I decided to order a side of beans and rice. When they arrived at my table the beans were EXTREMELY watery, and rice very bland and dry. I tried to force myself to eat them but I couldn't! I had to get my money back.. So, in conclusion, if you're really graving Mexican food I would not recommend this place.. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, generous portions and great service! I recommend the carnitas tacos! The side of guac is huge!"}
{"text":"Not the hours I like, but delicious food nonetheless. After many bad experience with \"breakfast burritos\" dh and I ventured in one day and ordered one to share. Not taking chances. We had a wait a little bit to get our made to order breakfast burrito, which was still quick considering the lady took the order, cooked it, and delivered it!   Dh took the first bite. He liked it, but that was not good enough for me. I took the next bite. Not too bad! The red chile sauce was spicy but not hot. After the 2nd bite I was impressed. The potatoes were cubed and cooked. Yum. This is a detail I look for and have not found very often. Anyone can cook hash brown potatoes, but it takes greater care and skill to cube cut the potato and cook it. The ratio of potato to egg was perfect as well. There was cheese added, but again just the right amount.   We went back for dinner. The store was empty. We had the choice to sit wherever we wanted. We sat by the window. This time there was a young girl helping. Food came out quickly and hot. Looked great. Tasted delicious. The beans, which we opted out of in the breakfast burrito, were spectacular! Normally when we are out, I give dh the beans, because they don't appeal to me, but there was no sharing these beans. The rice was moist and good as well.   We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Great new place. Breakfast burrito with bacon was great. The hard taco she'll was soggy and a little weird but the beef inside it was good. They have menudo on the weekends.  Gonna try that soon"}
{"text":"Tried to go here today and they are Permanently Closed. Their suite is empty. Very sad, was great Mexican food.      Ate lunch here today. Had the carne asada burrito and a chorizo taco. My co-worker had the cheese enchilada. Food was pretty good and fairly cheap. If you eat there they bring out chips and salsa to your table. The drink station is right next to the register, makes it a pain to get a refill if even one person is ordering. No unsweetened tea, only sweet tea and raspberry tea. The carne asada burrito had refried beans, rice and guacamole in it. Many more things on the menu I would like to try. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food and right now this place is #1 in my book I always come here while I'm out working if I can. from their burritos to the tacos everything is delicious and never disappoints the ladies that work here are awesome and always greet me with a smile I will always make time here to support the restaurant and spread the word about this awesome little place"}
{"text":"This is probably the closest to homemade that you can get in these style restaurants, best burritos hands down."}
{"text":"They make a mean Carne Asada Burrito with delicious green sauce. And they give you chips and salsa. That's all the reason I need right there."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the price is worth paying. The chicken rolled taquitos are my favorite."}
{"text":"I thought I'd give this place a try for lunch. It's a family owned restaurant with great food. I ordered the special burrito with asada, guacamole, poblanos, and beans. It was delicious!  It reminded me of the food back home. Most Mexican food places make their food Sonoran style but based on the style of food and the owners' accent I could tell they were from central Mexico. I was in and out in less than 10 minutes. I would highly recommend this place. My only suggestion to the owners is to not have family hanging out in the restaurant. It didn't bother me but I could see it scaring away other people. This is Chandler after all."}
{"text":"I thought this was authentic Mexican food. What a disappointment. I see why the place was empty when I walked in.   I asked for a burrito with rice, beans, lettuce and tomato. The blandest most tasteless $7 burrito I've ever had. $7 !!! For this!   Will never visit this place again."}
{"text":"I miss your rolled tacos.  I miss laughing when my wife would ask for the Hot Burrito without the hot pepper (doesn't that just make it a Burrito?).  I wish I could have one more plate of your huevos divorciados.  Your friendly, family-style service will not be replaced.  I miss uttering your name, wondering how many other burrito spots were working to make themselves \"hot\" like you.  I miss you, Hot Burrito.  Please come back."}
{"text":"Place is terrible, 12:30 Saturday afternoon, place was empty, now I know why.  The only good thing was the salsa.  The guac came out of a can, my wife repeated her order 3x and they still got it wrong.  Too many other Mexican joints to choose from, don't waste your time on this one."}
{"text":"I saw a review that said this place was typical Mexican food and so I had to pipe in.  This is not typical.  The menu items look typical, but what is different is the quality and flavor.  You can taste the authentic recipes, generous spices and home made tortillas.  And I really appreciate the fact that the red and green sauce they give you are real.  Lots of places like this will give you a watery concoction with you taco that is supposed to be some kind of house hot sauce, but at Hot Burrito you can see the chunks of tomatillo in the green (the one I always go with) and the flavor is so real!  I think the gal at the register may be the owner since she's always there, but either way, everyone there seems to genuinely care about the service and quality.  Great lunch or dinner spot.  Not fine dining, obviously it is what it is, but it is as good as it gets for a good quality and fast Mexican food strip mall type of place.  I'm getting hungry just typing about it."}
{"text":"The food is great. The service was prompt and courteous.  The interior is beautiful. I would definitely recommend it to a friend. Great for lunch. The owners clearly put in some work to make this a beautiful spot."}
{"text":"Bacon breakfast burrito was so good. Had tons of flavor. For sure will eat here again!"}
{"text":"That was awesome, I couldn't control myself again and I ordered two burritos. I got the special, which is an altered carne asada burrito with guac and green pepper. The other hand was a red chili burrito which was actually orange, and was spicy. I loved them both along with the service. I will be back for carne asada fries and those tortas that sounded great. It's not about the quantity, but the quality. Besides, if you eat there they give you chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Love it. Everything we've eaten here is delicious. They're always friendly and accommodating as well. Definitely recommend it to others. The prices are extremely reasonable as well, so we continue to return. It's one of our go-to spots for breakfast and sometimes lunch. I like that you can order breakfast burritos and lunch in the same order."}
{"text":"Tacos are a part of my heritage and always looking for fresh flavorful tacos as it is a staple of my diet, not to mention if you keep dairy off they are actually a healthier choice. Gluten free corn tortillas, lean meat and veggies with fat free salsa for a kick. The tacos here are perfect, almost as excellent as mine  Great service and people. Great prices and authentic!"}
{"text":"What a cute little restaurant. Although the size of this place is more geared towards a quickie to-go eatery the interior is nicely decorated with a warm sunny feel.  The menu has all your standard selections of burritos, tacos, and tortas. They also have caramelos for more of a Tucson flair. I went with the hot burrito special ($5.99), a carne asada burrito with refried beans, cheese, poblano pepper, and guacamole. I also tried some green chile burrito. Both burritos only took a few minutes to make.   The burrito itself was a decent size, filled with a lot of meat and refried beans. I enjoyed the addition of the pepper and it had good flavor. The cheese was well integrated within the burrito but there wasn't a lot of guacamole in it. The meat itself was slightly tough and chewy with gristle and fat. I had to spit out of few bites because there was so much fat in it. I had a bite of the green chile burrito too and it was tasty and flavorful.  I probably won't get a carne asada meal from here again but I will be back to try more from the menu. Overall 3.5/5."}
{"text":"I have lived in this city for over 2 years and I'm sad that I have JUST NOW found this place, as I am moving at the end of the month  This is by far the best burrito I have had in the entire valley! I ordered the red chili burrito, and while I can't speak for the rest of the menu, if it's anything even remotely close then it's fantastic. When I asked what the best things on their menu were, the red chili burrito was NOT one of the ones recommended, so I can only imaging how good some of their other food must be I can't say enough good things about this place, you just have to try it for yourselves!"}
{"text":"Omg so damn good. I'm surprised and impressed. Seldom do hole in the wall Mexican places warrant any kind of recommendation but this place is amazeballs!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Love small, independent joints.  Love supporting them.  Was hoping to love this place but I can't give it a stellar review, just an average one.  I'll start with the major plus - if you eat in, you get free chips and salsa.  The salsa is mild and fine, the chips are nice and thick.  I ordered the Hot burrito special burrito (beans, cheese, guacamole, carne asada, poblano peppers) and a cabeza taco.  The cabeza taco was fine.  Served street-style, it was pretty one-dimensional considering all the parts there are on head meat.  It tasted fine, the one tortilla it came on was torn, and I think they grill it after they braise it (just a guess).  It might order it again, I'm on the fence.  I was pinning my hopes on the burrito.  Size and value are just fine.  It was just OK in terms of taste.  Some ingredients in it were very cold so I got half a warm, half chilled burrito.  It got better near the end of the burrito when the warm elements heated up the cold ones.  The best part about this burrito is the chopped poblanos.  The beans, guacamole, and carne asada were just average.  As a whole, it'f filling and a decent value, but all in all, an average burrito.  Choices of sauce include a green tomatillo and a salsa roja for the burrito.  Go with the red."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident. It wAs ten minutes before they closed so we asked if we could come in and order.  The owner was very kind. We ordered tacos and while waiting they brought us chips. The salsa was home made and delicious. I gave it five stars because of the friendly owner!!! Super clean and cute decor.  Have I eaten better tacos? Yes, but sometimes an around the corner mom and pop establishment is nice. The food was very good and fresh. Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"This spot is nothing special.  Went based on the 4.5 stars it received on Yelp.  I ordered the number 14 which is a burrito of your choice with rice and beans.  It was average at best.  Minimal carne Asada in mine and it was fatty in several places.  Also had lots of fillers (rice and beans) that made it even more boring.  Wouldn't necessarily recommend this place unless you are starving.  There are way better options across the valley."}
{"text":"Great new place. My burrito was at least a pound or two. I got the carnitas and they gave me free chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times and haven't been disappointed yet. Their red / green hot sauce is what I'm always wanting more of. Recently got their chorizo breakfast burrito and finished it like a competitive eater (like I was in a race to finish it)"}
{"text":"Finally, authentic Mexican food with fresh ingredients. Great variety, friendly staff, fantastic value, and awesome flavor. Love to dine local!"}
