{"text":"The only thing I remember from this restaurant is that the bathroom smells waft pervasively into the dining room. I can't even remember what the food tasted like, because I was trying to overcome the smell of sewage and urinal cakes throughout my meal.  The other thing I remember is the server being extremely impatient and cranky with us because we were the last table remaining (although official closing time had not yet passed).  The only reason this place received more than one star is because I can only imagine the food wasn't inedible...although I don't remember it."}

{"text":"Their app was amazing. Entree was not bad, could use a bit more seasoning. Nice atmosphere and worth it's price"}
{"text":"My partner and I were given a gift certificate redeemable at this restaurant for a dinner for 2. It included 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and 2 desserts. We had not gone out in a while so we were quite excited to have a nice evening together, which we did! That being said it had nothing to do with our visit to this establishment which was entirely disappointing.  We went in around 6PM. The moment we walked through the door a man asked us if we had a certificate and we told him yes. He was rather snooty and not very welcoming. We were seated in a nice corner and we ordered some wine. That was the last time the man came to help us.  About 10 minutes later a young woman came with the wine and to take our orders. We ordered some calamari and a shrimp/scallop app to start. We didn't recieve our appetizers until about 710pm. We were in no rush but we thought it strange that no one had come to check on us during that whole 45ish minutes.  There was no lemon wedge with the calamari so we asked if we could get one. The server acted like it was a huge problem for her to get us some lemon. The grilled calamari was dry and tasted like charcoal. On the other had the shrimp and scallop tasted great...although it was just that, a single small scallop and a single shrimp in a pool of butter and spice. We were glad we weren't actually paying as it was a 12-14$ app.  We were finished with the apps within 20 minutes or so but no one came back until they served our entrees at about 810. By a server we hadn't seen yet. A whole 2 hours after we arrived. I had a pasta dish with smoked salmon and my partner had linguine Alfredo with spinach (Which was apparently a hassle to substitute the meat for spinach when we ordered) Both dishes were inedible. I am a huge fan of all types of fish, I eat sashimi like its nobody's business. But this dish tasted like old rotten fish. I gave it a second taste but I pushed the dish to the center of the table. My partners entree looked like noodle soup. It had the consistency of warm milk and cheese. My partner tried to eat it but pushed it away after a few bites.  So then we continued to play the waiting game, betting on how long it would be until someone would come back. Well neither of us won that game because no one ever did come back. Not even the original man who served us , not even after he walked near us, looked at our table with the dishes pushed away...he just turned around. Anyways I got up after 45 MINUTES of waiting and asked a young woman if she could help us. She was very polite and helped us pack up our food (hoping someone at home might like it. Even our bravest friend wouldn't eat it) we ordered our desserts to go and we were out of there just after 9PM. Nearly 3 hours after we arrived. Without the certificate we would have been looking at a 100$ bill.  Very disappointed and I will steer anyone away from this place.  Service - 1/5 Food - 1.5/5 Atmosphere 4/5 Value - 1/5  Overall - 1.5/5"}

{"text":"The appetizers were good, got the fried calamari and shrimp with scallops. But the entree was... good but could be tastier, we got the grilled lamb chop and veal. We got a cheesecake and tiramisu for dessert and disappointingly the tiramisu wasn't good considering it's an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"friendly staff.  great dishes (although a little big of portions for my tummy).  recommend the. lasagna and eggplant Parmesan. love the chocolate raspberry ice cream for desert."}
{"text":"Used a groupon. $110 for for 3 course meal for 4 ppl. So many choices.   Appetizers: calamari (so tender and crisp and huge portion), coconut shrimp (delicious, but smallest appetizer out of the four. there were 6 shrimp), spaghetti carbonara (huge portion and really good), spaghetti with seafood (mussels, 3 really big shrimp, octopus and calamari. also really good...and huge portion). I ordered the spaghetti with seafood. If I had eaten it all, I would have had no room for the entree. Did I mention they have complimentary garlic bread?   Entrees: 2 AAA ribeyes, 1 veal chop, 1 branzino. Ribeye cooked perfectly. Asked for medium rare. It came medium rare! Veal chop was incredibly tender and for lack of better words, subtly sweet-savory. Branzino was creamy and skin was crisp. All entrees came with a giant piece of fresh broccoli, string beans and baby carrots. All veggies were really fresh too. Portions were also huge (I'm sensing a trend here).  Dessert: 1 lemon cake (not too sweet), light, not sour. 1 puff pastry with cream and chocolate (for all you chocolate mousse fans out there, this one is for you), not too rich, 1 field-berry cheesecake (can't comment on this one, didn't try it), 1 chocolate, raspberry tartufo, beautiful, not too sweet, refreshing.  Service: Amazing. Clean. They clear off your cutlery with each course. They constantly refill your water. They warm the plates so your food doesn't get cold. They asked at least three times during our meal whether we were enjoying everything (we were).  Good stuff! I'm keeping my eye out for more groupons for Sabatino's!"}
{"text":"We went there with the groupon. The service are excellent. The environment is good. We have to choose our food from their special menus but not the regular menus. The portion is great. They gave us one more dessert for four of us to try. I would say it is worth the price."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that I am the first to review Sabatino's!  I happened to find this hidden gem from their coupon in the entertainment book. I am always looking for a new Italian restaurant.  As soon as you walk in you are friendly greeted. We were offered whether we wanted to sit at a square or round table. We picked the round table since there was three of us and was very comfortable.  Sabatino's Ristorante is a lovely cozy little restaurant with very courteous staff who are very professional and attentive. They are constantly filling up your water glass without having to ask for a refill. They offer a house garlic bread which is free of charge and was delicious but don't fill up before your meal arrives because the portions are enormous!   We all decided on the veal parmigiana, one with veggies and the other two with fettuccini in Alfredo sauce. The fettucini was excellent, I would go back just to get that again! I am very glad that I decided to get it with the veal which was also good but not as good as the pasta! What can I say I am a pasta kind of girl (:  What I really liked which must places do not seem to do right anymore is that they waited until everyone was finished before they cleared the table. Why is that so hard to do? I hate when people try taking away your plate and you are not even finished yet!  We all finished our meals and there was no room left to try some dessert but I am sure I will have another chance to try the dessert as I plan on coming back soon!  Also there are more coupons you can print out online for the entertainment book and there was a coupon on their website but it expired last year. It was 15% off, the coupon in the entertainment book is for $20.00 off. The prices are very reasonable too.   I would recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing experience! Purchased a voucher for two. The restaurant is very nice and cozy. Our waitress was the best I ever met. She was very friendly and helpful. Would highly recommend to go to the restaurant if you want to try very tasty food, good wine (and not expensive for such a restaurant) and have  a wonderful romantic evening!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for the first time last night with a group on coupon. I wasn't sure what to expect. But I was very impressed. The staff are friendly. The menu had lots of variety and the food tasted excellent. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Tried this place with a Living Social voucher. Upon arriving and confirming we had a voucher, we were seated in the back corner at a table that was not even prepared. It was fairly empty we sat down and waited for about 10 mins to be asked about drinks and the voucher deal. The waiting got worse as the night went on. Each course took forever and not one person asked how we liked any of the dishes.  It seemed that we waited long stretches of time all night to see either the guy who greeted us or the one waitress working. In a nutshell, service 1, food 2.5, would I go back?  Not even with a bigger discount.   Food was average for the high price they were asking. Spend the extra $20 in LS voucher and go 1 block to Il Mulino, amazing food and excellent service. Sabatino's could learn something from them."}
{"text":"First off I want to say that that staff was patient and friendly and pretty much amazing. The lasagna was great, the coconut shrimp was tasty, and all the desserts were delicious.   That being said, they tried to hide a very fat filled steak to me which I did not appreciate. The steak was rather thin and there was an excess of juice on top like there were hiding something and sure enough, it was the fact there was not much meat on my \"AAA\" steak. The others seemed fine, I just seemed to be the lucky one. The others didn't have much juice on theirs either to prove they did it on purpose.   Side note, we got this place off of a groupon and were expecting whatever we wanted for that price but that is not what we were offered. We got a 'special' menu that had a subsection of items you could order. I understand why they did that but why have the entire menu on the site when that is not what you can order from. Sure you can instead convert your groupon to cash but what is the point then? Shady practice there. Just say it at the beginning and we probably would have been fine with it. I'll just quote it down here in case they change it later;  Basically it does give you a small list of items on the site and in fact when you go there you have more options but still, you can't order anything you want. And it is not straightforward in that regards.   After all is said and done. I did enjoy myself, just also felt a bit taken advantage of as well which I was not happy with. I guess I could have told the waiter about the steak but since there went out of their way to hide it, I saw no point."}
{"text":"Sabatino's is alright. Nothing bad that stands out, and nothing good that stands out either.   We called ahead for a reservation for two people. They said they were booked until 7pm. We would have preferred 6pm, but not a big deal. When we arrived, the restaurant was partially filled, but not crowded. I suppose it was a cold Saturday night to head out for dinner.   The service was professional, polite and pleasant albeit a little absent-minded. Our server was friendly, but she failed to take notice and to refill our waters. We asked for pepper, but were forgotten for our secondi. Our dishes were cleared away at a reasonable speed. That said, we stayed 30 minutes past closing time, and they never indicated (or pressured) us in any way to leave.   We had a Dealfind coupon for a four-course prix fixe dinner. The portions are large, but as someone else mentioned, it is mostly filler. We choose the fried calamari as our appetizer. Out of the four courses, the calamari was most memorable. Not overcooked or undercooked, and fried just right with a side of lemon. The secondi was simply \"oodles of noodles\" with four shrimps. The sauce was alright, and did not taste much better than what I could make at home.    Our main course was steak served with broccoli and mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were not very good. I'm not sure what it was, but it tasted like milk-powdered mix with a terrible aftertaste. Neither my friend and I touched the potatoes beyond a simple sampling. The steak was good, but it was difficult to tell because the sauce that covered the steak had a deluge of whole peppercorns (and at the same time, appeared to be placed within the steak). With each bite of steak, there was the crunch of pepper exploding into your mouth. I like pepper, but not whole peppercorns.  Finally, for dessert, we both opted for the tiramisu, which was okay. It was not prepared with Amaretto, but rather rum or brandy (I'm not sure). The taste of the liqueur was rather strong and there was minimal coffee flavour. Perhaps this is a personal preference. I like my tiramisu with Amaretto and strong coffee.   Overall, the service was quite well, and, in my opinion, better than the food. The food was alright for the amount we paid for it, but I did not care for it too much.  Parking is paid street parking / around the neighbourhood."}
