{"text":"Beautiful inside.  Great food.  Great atmosphere and I have to say this over and over and over again.  THIS IS NOT A CHAIN!!!!
Next time you are out and you need to entertain for business, rethink the corporate usuals and give this place a go.  

Well worth the short trip out of uptown."}

Dear Friends of McIntosh's,
 
It is with great sadness that I have closed our restaurant after 13 years of business.  The increased competition and economy was the driving factor in this business decision.
 
I want you to know how much I appreciated your patronage and support through the years.  I know many of you celebrated life's great milestones at our restaurant.  For that we are grateful.  I know McIntosh's will live on forever through those memories.  They were special times for us as well.  I could not have made it through these years without our amazing staff.  I owe our success to them.
 
So, let's raise a glass to the future.  I hope our paths will cross again.
 
Very tuly yours,

Greg McIntosh and the entire staff of McIntosh's Steaks & Seafood
