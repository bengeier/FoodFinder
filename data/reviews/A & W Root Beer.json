{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on our way back to Vegas, and the food was great. We both had a bacon cheeseburger. The food was hot and tasted really good. 

The service was great. The woman at the drive thru was really nice and friendly, and made sure she had gotten our order right. 

Nice little restaurant in Boulder City!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with the family for root beer floats. My 3 boys and wife loved them. Did try the food so I can't comment on that but the old school (but clean) feel and the float made me feel like a kid again."}
{"text":"This A&W is cool because it is so old.  However, I very much dislike eating in a hot restaurant.  This place is hot and uncomfortable.  Turn the AC on!!!"}
{"text":"Super nice workers and good old A&W hot dog fries and a root beer float. So skip the other chains and stop in here instead."}
{"text":"We wanted to stop her and grab a chili dog and a root beer. We have one of these back home, and was hoping for something even close to what we've had. Well, it wasn't- not even close. The employees were nice, and the root beer was good,but seriously the worst chili dog ever. The hot dog itself was grossly old and the chili tasted terrible. To top it off (literally),the cheese on the hot dog was a slice of American cheese cut into two strips. We didn't even realize until after that one and only bite. Total disappointment."}
{"text":"I have a huge shout out for the employees here! So professional at the end of the night and to the cook all I can say is amazing! I will always come back to enjoy the perfectly cooked classic burgers!"}
{"text":"We always stop to get a mug and burger when in Boulder city. Frost mug provided with root beer. Building is  vintage 1950's or 60's and is unchanged. Stop in!"}
{"text":"This place is like a step back ino the 80s. It is how I remembered A&W when I was a little guy. This place has the best root beer floats and freezes, but the food is like your average bowling alley... Always greesy but  has that familiar delicious taste. Overall a classy establishment, but old school (which gives it it's charm)."}
{"text":"Err.... I wouldn't stop here again.  It's a classic joint but this location was not the best of A & W's.  At least it's on Route 66"}
{"text":"Needed a quick bite and haven't eaten here for a long time. We won't be going back anytime soon. My daughter ordered a kids meal. The crayons were just thrown into the bag and melted into her fries. Seriously she has colored french fries. I ordered the chicken wings, which were alright, but a lot to greasy. The sodas only had about 5 pcs of ice each, we went and asked for a refill and had to ask for ice, because they were just going to put the warm soda I the cup without it."}
{"text":"They closed our local A&W, so it's a treat when we come across one during our travels. Ordered the Papa Burger as always, and a root beer. The Papa Burger had to be the largest I've ever received. The root beer was perfect, as it should be. The counter staff even brought a pitcher out to give us refills. Great service, great food."}
{"text":"On our way to Las Vegas when we started to get hungry rolling through Boulder City. We were going to wait until the outskirts of Las Vegas, maybe Henderson, for lunch but saw this . . . an A&W !! Haven't had an old style burger and good ol' A&W root beer in ages. We stopped . . . Just as I remember it ! Good ol' flat top burger with all the trimmings and root beer refills !! One of the staff came around with a pitcher of root beer and filled up our mugs . . . loved it ! Great spot for lunch - glad we stopped - brought back memories from the 1960's !!"}
{"text":"I had never been to A&W before (even though they have them in TN) and my boyfriend and I were on our way back to Vegas from Hoover Dam when we decided to stop here for some food. You have to get the root beer float in one of the frosty mugs, that's a given. It's delish.

The food is pretty much just the standard fast food fare. Cheese curds and the mini corn dogs are pretty damn good choices. When we first pulled up, I told my boyfriend that this particular location looked like an original A&W restaurant (the ones back home are obviously new - in the last 10 years). And everything inside is super retro and looks original. From previous reviews, it looks like they've kept pretty much everything the same. The only bad thing is the bathrooms. They're small and kinda gross, so avoid those if you can. Otherwise, pretty damn good!"}
{"text":"Now it has been just about 60 days, I called again with the manager promising to get back to me within 48 hours and guess what???? No call. I am thoroughly disgusted with their attitude towards customers. The sad part is their food is pretty decent. I however am done with this establishment, hopefully I get my money back before Christmas. That would be a true miracle!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but place was dirty. Don't go in the bathroom if you get grossed out easily.  Root beer was great!"}
{"text":"Waiting 19 minutes and counting for food. Drive thru getting food but not diners. Received food after 20 minutes.  One counter person friendly the other was not. Out of frosted mugs as well. How do you let your freezer not be stocked when customers are counting on the frosty mug root beer.  Will not come back."}
{"text":"I would highly highly highly recommend this place if your looking to go to an A & W Restaraunt. All the associates were so nice, respectful and made me feel welcomed. The food was fast and honestly quite delicious. We got the root beer right after the barrel was changed and oh my goodness was it delicious!! The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars was due to the fact almost every table was dirty when we went to sit and wait for our food. Other than that- everything was great. They even delivered our food to us when it was ready and grabbed our mugs to refill when they saw they were empty. Very pleased with our visit here."}
{"text":"Saddest bacon cheeseburger! The top part of my bread was hard. I couldn't eat it and removed it from my sandwich. The slices of onion were too thick and overpowered the beef patty which was meh. I am usually a fan of A&W and was bragging to my kids on how it was going to be a treat. I was sorely mistaken.

The onion rings and the root beer was okay. They did have their classic infamous root beer served in a frosty mug (5 stars for that). However, I was appalled by the soggy fries, the sad burger buns, the overpowering onions and the meh service that we received.

A&W Boulder City, you let me down this time."}
{"text":"This little place is wonderful! The food is great and the workers are nice. Every time I go in, I get a #5- a bacon cheeseburger meal and it's delicious with piles of bacon on it. I've been to other A&W's and this one is the best by far. It's the best fast-food place in the valley. It's way cheap- 2 meals for $12."}
{"text":"I stopped in here today and had lunch. It is friendly, reasonably priced and the food was delish. I had the double bacon cheese burger, fries and a frosty mug of root beer, served up in the old school heavy glass frosty mug. ( My doctor is out of town :-D ) The decor is old school which I appreciated. 

During the time I was there, someone was cleaning inside and out, the place is inviting. 

I particularly enjoyed my frosty mug of root beer, and refills were free!! 

No squeeze packets for Ketchup or mustard either, they have the real deal.

I am a fan and will be going back."}
{"text":"I paid for a double burger and got a single patty.  The thing was gross anyway so I am glad I didn't complain and ask for another patty of gray meat.

But yay for the fried cheese curds.  Good luck finding that item on most menus no matter where you are.  They were like hot little mozzarella bites.

Good fries, too.

But if you want a double burger, better order three patties just in case they forget one."}
{"text":"Really? You should have more respect. Told you no pickles (husband is allergic) and you put them on the burger under the cheese! Glad I took a bite before he ate it. Not cool at all!!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst experience EVER !! Wish I could rate this excuse of a fast food place a Minus 10. 
Remember the movie Fast Times at Ridgemont High?  Yeah, well remember the druggie played by Sean Penn... Picolli? Yeah the space case socially inept clueless wonder lives and breathes. And they don't make him work the grill! He's right out front being about as unaware of customer service, respect or maturity as a human could possibly be. 

Was it just our misfortune to stop by on his first and hopefully last day? I would like to offer some suggestions. But it's not worth it.  No I refuse to believe it! Everyone deserves a chance. But not everyone has common sense or needs to be unsupervised! Kudos to the person who hired him trying to give him a chance. Have him shadow your best Employee silently for a week ..., then evaluate his first fledgling interactions with your customers. Give immediate feedback. Repeat!lastly.... Don't be afraid to assign him to tasks behind the grill!! 

I shudder thinking back on our visit there! Moving in! I wish ya'll the best!"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places to stop on the way out of Vegas but I think it's time to find somewhere new. It's not being kept up and has deteriorated to the point of being gross. The staff seems well suited to unpleasant dive this place has become. Management  is happy to stand there and yell at people in Spanish and do little else. Time to let go of the memories, because this isn't the place you remember, that place was good."}
{"text":"This place is nice! Awesome customer service, very friendly staff. The food is okay. The fries dont taste like they're soaked in oil all night. The root beer float is a must try! The place is clean and cozy. Will come back again."}
{"text":"Run- Run for the hills or the mountains in this case! 

I was headed to Laughlin and needed to eat something before the road trip so I thought hmm, A&W- different from my normal food routine, lets ch-ch-check it out!  Well I wish i would ra-ra-ran the other way!!

I can honestly say that I have never felt like I was not wanted in a fast food restaurant before, but alas, I finally found one!  I went to order my food and the guy literally acted like someone ran over his dog and I was the cause of it all!  I understand people have bad days, and I understand that serving food may just not be the most fun thing in the whole wide world, HOWEVER--- Do not take that out on your customers, I mean get a clue duuuuuude!  

So, I ordered something, then said wait no just kidding, my mistake, make that chicken instead of a burger.  \"Sir, are you going to make a final decision\"  EXCUSE ME?! Oh lawd child I know he did just not! Eeeek! 

I said no I'm done, check please.....

I ate the food, which was decent and did my hail marys for all the bad things I was thinking about that middle aged fella behind the cash register.  

Tip: Avoid if you're feeling slightly groggy, irritated, or possibly like you're in THAT mood- because you might just act on what I was thinking of saying to that guy!"}
{"text":"Typical A&W food, excellent service, I love finding these little places!"}
{"text":"Forgot the cheeseburger we ordered, politely asked for it and showed receipt, took a second for them to throw it together and then forgot the cheese anyways. Realized when I got all the way home so had to add my own cheese. Chili cheese fries were so full of salt I couldn't eat it. My moms chicken sandwich was chicken tenders on a bun instead of a patty like the menu shows. Waste of $20. Wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"Love this place forecer, even if the building looks old and obviously needs some work. Service is kind of slow bit I think it's cause they are under- staffed. However, with all the aside my root beer floats was absolutely delicious and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Don't get too excited about some floats and fried cheese curds- they close when they want, so food at (gasp) 7:30 may not be happening, even though their hours say open 'till 8."}
{"text":"Don't come here for the savory food.. cuz there isn't any. But if you like rootbeer floats I think this is the best place to come to, especially after a long day on the lake. They come in two sizes and they will refill your mugs with rootbeer for free. So when you get yours.. don't eat the ice cream first.. drink the root beer cream.. then get your refill.. yum"}
{"text":"This place is a little shabby. It is showing its age and needs some work. It looks as though it was a cool retro place at one time and now is surrounded by newer businesses that seem busier. I stopped in after visiting the hoover dam and was greeted by a long haired guy with a baseball cap just slapped on his head. He should at least put his hair in a ponytail as it looks unprofessional and the family in front of us was really put off by it as they commented about it once seated.
I ordered a burger a specific way and it came out wrong. Got another and it was overcooked.

The root beer and onion rings were good and there was a cool mural on the wall ( added photo of that) 

Maybe try the drive thru instead."}
{"text":"Decided to grab some Floats because I haven't had one in a while. We ordered 3 floats, onion rings and cheese curds. 

Cheese curds were good. Didn't need sauce. The floats were good. Hard to mess this up. Onion rings were meh. Needed sauce and didn't come with any.

Staff was horrible. 3 guys today behind the counter at 2:30 on 12/9 were cursing at each other behind the counter in front of guests. This is completely unprofessional. It made two guests leave and the rest really uncomfortable. We were all awkwardly staring at each other like \"can they see us?\"

Restaurant for how old and the staff was pretty clean. No table was dirty. Restaurant bathrooms were gross. I rather go at a truck stop. Couldn't even see yourself In the mirror...gross"}
{"text":"Dropped down 3 stars! 
SAD to say the years are taking its toll here.
Cheese burger wasn't the same, you can tell it was made carelessly.
French fries were a mix of good, the bad and the soggy.
Root beer in a not so frosty mug and kind of flat.

The theme \"All American Food\" is a disgrace to the USA.

The clincher is the \"B\" grade posted on the wall by the health department.

Someone rescue this place!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way back from the Hoover dam expecting to have a  root beer float. The draft for the root beer was broken had to get fountain diet root beer instead, she forgot to give me my military discount what she said was only 10% which on the door is clearly States 20%.
And I didn't get either on of them... Asked for a ice tea and was given raspberry iced tea because she forgot to mention  They don't even have plain ice tea.  For this being the last AW in Nevada I would figure they would be a bit more pride and service and in the food they give oh well..."}
{"text":"This place is obviously older and a bit run down by the appearance on the inside. The bathroom needs a complete gut because i felt like i was in a rest stop restroom. It wasn't clean and i just felt diseased coming out of there. The cashier is another story. He was one of those nice but rude through sarcasm people. I could tell he was definitely trying to be a decent person but fighting his hate of customers on the inside! E for effort though. He got into a little argument with someone behind him when he asked him for help with how to give a military discount. The food was excellent on the upside! Everything was fresh. So fresh that when I bit into my chicken strip the juice inside was so hot it squirted out and burnt my face and my sons arm who was sitting next to me and also got squirted! He was not happy! It seemed a bit pricey but it was good. At one point someone who I assumed was either the manager or owner asked if everything was good and asked if we needed anything and my son mentioned napkins. Him asking implied to me he would grab them for us but he said that he could go ask the front counter for them. I thought that was kinda awkward. Like don't ask if we need anything. Anyways they do offer military discount and the food was good so that's y I give them 4 stars, I would go back if in the area."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my RootBeer float.. Mom had the coke float.. U can have any type of float they have on the soda tap..  Hot day.. Great cool off. Looks like I stepped back into the 80's with there diner decor. But nice friendly staff... They Aldo give u free refills on the sodas..."}
{"text":"Great place brings back old memories from childhood. They have great service the food is still excellent definitely worth the drive from vegas.  Definitely will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Went out to Boulder City. Monday at 4:30pm this place was closed. I believe permanently. It is reported on FB to be permanently closed."}
{"text":"I am reliving my High School lunches. Root Beer Freezes and burgers. I wish I could eat all of the chili dogs I used to consume back during HS lunch half hours. Always great to go inside and get those frosty cold A&W mugs of root beer. Why Car Clubs do not have meetings here is beyond a shame. THIS is a true American Classic!!!"}
{"text":"I love old fashioned American dining.  A & W root beer is by far the best root beer on the planet.  This place could use an update and facelift on some much needed rennovations, but the food is excellent.  I always try to stop by here on my visits to Boulder City.  I can't help myself even if it's just for a root beer float.  Refills are free too.  :)"}
{"text":"I met a friend for lunch at this A&W in Boulder City which is supposed to be the only free standing A&W in Nevada.

I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries and a regular size root beer float.  I took the float and my receipt and went to a table.  They call out your receipt number when the person is delivering your tray.

The burger was well done and was topped with some fresh onions and the cheese.  It was  a fairly standard burger.  The fries were good.  The star of lunch was the root beer float--a mug of cold root beer with soft serve added to the 2/3 full mug to bring the liquid up.

Plastic ware, napkins, and some condiments are at the end of the counter to the left of where you order although there are extra napkins brought with the order.

I have wanted to try this spot for some time.  It's an OK place for fast food."}
{"text":"Sign and website says open tell 8 there where people inside wouldn't  tell us why it was closed just locked doors... we had looked forward all day to going there as we where heading to the the cemetery for an anniversary.  Drove an hour from other side of vegas and didn't grab anything to eat just so my daughter could get a root beer float. It's not even 7."}
{"text":"Childhood memories to be found in Boulder City, NV at this A&W!  Step back in time to experience getting a burger and a root beer float!  The kinda ice cream floats that brought a smile to a child's face!"}
{"text":"The Good:  Who doesn't like A&W root beer.  Hey if you are anywhere near this joint there are not many food options so this might be a good choice.  Basic fast food, blah blah blah.  I went with a crispy chicken sandwich, okay, nothing fancy.  They do have a root beer tap and serve you your root beer in a frosted mug, this alone is worth going here.  Oh yeah, grab a root beer float too, you'll take me later :D

The Bad:  Slim pickings here.  If you don't go to a mom and pop place around here then I would say go here.

The Ben:  Sure the refills are free, just make sure you are close to a restroom.  Same rules apply here as to real beer, once you break the seal it's game over."}
{"text":"This place has great food but they need to keep it clean inside and out. Lots of people come in and out of here. The place seems to be pretty busy. Maybe the people working r just to busy w/business to keep up on the cleaning in the eating area and bathrooms. I will still keep coming to eat here when we come into Boulder city BC its one of my favorite places to eat at."}
{"text":"What can I say, I love root beer floats!  There are no A&Ws near where I live, so I always jump at the opportunity to get a float when I come across one.  

We saw this A&W as we were headed back from visiting the Hoover Dam.  It was hot as heck outside, and a float from here was a perfect way to cool down.  I also ordered a hamburger and some fries.  The hamburger was good, and I have always thought A&W has had decent burgers.  The fries, on the other hand, were not so good.  They lacked flavor, and were dry and way too hard.

I was still hungry after eating, mainly because I couldn't eat one more nasty fry, so I decided I wanted to get something else.  I saw the 'Freeze' on the menu, and wanted to give it a shot because it looked like a perfect treat for a hot day.  It was fantastic!!!!!  It is a blended root beer float consisting of ice cream and soda, and the texture and taste of it was amazing.  Although it has the same ingredients as a root beer float, I liked it even more.

I am always down to go to A&W to get a float.  I have a new found love of their Freezes as well.  If I ever find myself going to the Hoover Damn again, I will be sure to stop by on a hot day."}
{"text":"Ordered two diet sodas, which he poured, and when I got out my card to pay I was told that they couldn't complete my transaction because the boss was on the phone and they only had dial-up. So I asked if I could just have the sodas that he had already poured for me, to which I just got a shrug. No soda for you!"}
{"text":"A frosty mug of draft root beer really hits the spot. Also the best root beer float around. Burgers and fries are also pretty good by fast food standards."}
{"text":"I love a&w but this restaurant is in desperate need of some tlc. It's very run down. I've been to this location three times over the past few months and it just makes me sad whenever I'm in there. The last time I was there it was raining and I could see water dripping from the ceiling behind the counter and onto the top of their menu. You can see where there are other leaks by the damage.

The food, service, and root beer have always been good though. I feel like a renovation would make this location much more appealing to tourists."}
{"text":"Used to eat at A&W in California in the 70's so had to stop by.  The PROS:  two employees I interacted with were very nice, A grade on the wall, the papa burger was excellent, the root beer was the best I've ever had.  Kinda MEH:  The building has a \"built in the 50's and nothing's been changed since then\" which is fine with me but the bathroom could use a little sprucing up."}
{"text":"This vintage old-school style A&W joint in Boulder City is a must-stop for an old fashioned root beer float, served on a frosty cold mug!! I love that they have diet root beer (2 stars earned) which is my version of the perfect float...not too sweet!! If your'e hungry, they offer great eats of juicy burgers & crispy French fries!! Great all American food!! A true dive place, fast-food establishment, where one can only care about the food and not the service or the ambience...Lol!! ;)"}
{"text":"Stopped at this vintage A&W restaurant on the way back from Las Vegas last weekend for a nice cool refreshing treat.  We both had the classic rootbeer float.  It was delicious and brough back such great memories as a child.  Only used the drive-through so cannot comment on anything else."}
{"text":"The burgers were dry and just not good.   I applaud the establishment for hiring the seemingly mentally handicapped teens behind the counter, but perhaps you give a little more training to them.  The speed of service was fine, if you had nothing to do the rest of the day.   The only thing that gets us there is that stupid root beer float.   Nothing has that flavor.  It is especially good on a 116 degree day."}
{"text":"I would LOVE to buy this place. I've been here 4 times and if the burgers and root beer weren't here, neither would I be! Our food was great! Staff speaks Spanish to each other. Disgusting ceiling fans!!!! Restrooms needed attention. And NO air condition. Today was 80 degrees. It has such potential. So sad  great location large place, good parking, but apparently a owner/management problem."}
{"text":"Horrible service waited 21 minutes before I asked for a refund...
Norma, the manager thinks the drive thru is a priority, 4 cars went by and we still had nothing.
Even skipped our number!
What a waste of time.
A bunch of people not knowing what to do!
Nincompoops!

Turns out they were to busy giving a bunch of free food to their people."}
{"text":"We stopped by this place on our way back to the strip after Hoover Dam. We noticed it on our way to Hoover Dam but was to full from breakfast to get anything. My husband was adamant that we make this stop. Hawaii closed the one and only A&W, a few years back, and he misses it. This restaurant was nice and spacious. It was also very clean.

The only thing that we got was the infamous A&W root beer float. The float was good with the soft serve vanilla ice cream in their root beer. They put too much ice cream and not enough soda. We were left just eating the soft serve ice cream.

I'd rather just buy the A&W root beer and make my own float at home."}
{"text":"I have enjoyed this establishment for many years and NEVER been disappointed You can spend twice as much for a hamburger and it probably won't be as tasty. Brings back a lot goid memories of the good old days of burgers, fries and shakes.  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Nice and clean,  yummy food. Friendly employees too. We come here all the time during sports season"}
{"text":"A&W Rootbeer is amazing in a frosted mug! 'Nuff said. I didn't try the food."}
{"text":"When I saw there was an A&W in Boulder City, I got really excited. I grew up in NE Ohio, and there was an A&W near my grandma's house. Going here totally brought back childhood memories! Everything from the signage to the hot dogs to the root beer floats in glass mugs. 

I ordered a cheese dog, fries, and naturally, a root beer float. Everything was so good! Exactly how I remembered it. The floats are so yummy! My boyfriend got a float, papa burger, and fries. He loved everything. 

 I asked for an unsalted meat patty for my dog, and they were very cool about it. Archie really liked it! 

I recommend A&W if you're in Boulder City!"}
{"text":"I have never been to an A & W that wasn't attached to a Long John Silvers so this was surprising to me. The inside was nice and clean. The staff was great and polite. Great customer service skills. AND the food was delicious! Can't go wrong with chili cheese fries."}
{"text":"Food is typical A& W food, but don't expect any sort of Customer service from this group. They got my husbands order completely wrong, and they were hesitant to correct it. When it did come out correct nearly ten minutes later, the girl slid the tray onto the table and walked away, not a word or a smile or even a hint of service or hospitality."}
{"text":"A&Ws are few are far between in Cali and always stuck with a KFC wherever I've seen them. So a free standing A&W was cool as I haven't been in once of those since I was a kid. 

Beyond that they are just your typical American fast food place with a few unique items. Like A&W Root Beer Floats! Which is all we stopped 

The staff here were friendly though and the fries weren't overcooked or over salted. You'd been surprised at how many fast food places overcook their fries."}
{"text":"I love A&W!  Great food, super great root beer on tap!  Good value, good food, what's not to like."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times. The food is good. But the service not so much. 

I've seen them close as early as 7pm. 

I also find it really weird that they run a garden hose out of the drive through window and wash they own cars in the parking lot as they are closing......"}
