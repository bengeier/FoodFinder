{"text":"Don't be fooled by the modest appearance. We entered to be greeted by the most enthusiastic restaurateur I have as of yet encountered. This guy was the host, server, and cook. An all around spirit guide on this culinary adventure. Everything is made fresh, with heart, and with spirit.

We split the cold noodles and soup dumplings.  The soup dumplings were excellent. I don't live anywhere near this place, but I really want to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Unreal dumpling place! Great every time!
Try the fried!!

Really good for take away as well"}
{"text":"My new favourite restaurant in MTL. A bit out of the way, on St-Laurent just below the 40, but well worth the trip. Soup dumplings (Zhao long bao) are not easy to come by in this town, but this place serves up 10 per order, and they are soupy and delicious. They have vinegar and chili oil waiting on each table. The egg and scallion pancake is also not to be missed. The cucumber salad is refreshing and has a nice kick. Get here early, as the place begins filling up by noon. I will be back to try other dumplings and the cold noodles with scallions."}
{"text":"Nice little find. Hole in the wall straight from #china. Amazing dumplings, soup esp. The egg pancake. Can't wait to come back for that."}
