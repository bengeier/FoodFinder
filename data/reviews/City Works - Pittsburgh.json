{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place out during our first visit to Pittsburgh. We were initially attracted Because looked really nice from the outside.  The decor inside was nice. The host seated is promptly. Our server was over quite promptly as well and was very nice. My husband ordered the chicken wings and the fries pickles. I ordered the ribs. Our food was out in a reasonable time. My husband enjoyed his choices. Unfortunately, my ribs were way over done and I was barely able to cut them. It took a little while before our server was back so that I could mention the issue. Once I mentioned it he was very apologetic and offered to have it remade which was nice. I decided against it. Shortly thereafter the manager came over and asked what the problem was and I explained to him as well. He was very courteous. In the end, they removed the food from the bill without hesitation. Overall our experience wasn't terrible here but the food was not stellar. If you are just going for drinks it is definitely a nice place with a nice atmosphere and good customer service. The three stars is strictly due to the food experience."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great, food is delicious and staff is on point! Have been there many times and plan on returning!"}
{"text":"First time in the city and trust this will not be on my list of places to return to.  I ordered salmon and it was so overdone that it actually crumbled on the plate. When I sent it back all I received in return was I'm sorry from the waitress. Don't ask how I want it prepared if you don't know how to prepare it. I drank my lemonade while my friends ate overcooked burgers. I should of had fast food. At least it's consistent. Also this place is so entirely loud. I think they are attempting to be a sports bar. But the prices being as high as they are and the food being subpar I would have to disagree with the efforts. Two days left in the city. I hope I can find some good food. Because this isn't it"}
{"text":"What a joke! I'd do ZERO stars if it were option.

The long and short of it is a coworker and I arrived at City Works at 5:40 PM on a Wednesday hoping to grab a beer and dinner. We were promptly seated by the hostess and there we sat...and sat more, and sat some more. This went on for 30 whole minutes. Not one server ever approached us or offered the slightest bit of eye contact. We finally decided to get up and go to another restaurant in the Square. As luck would have it, on the way out the door, we happened to cross paths with one of the the managers and he asked if everything was alright. We told him no, we've been sitting for 30 minutes and not one server has acknowledged our presence, we missed any chance of happy hour and we were now very hungry.  He attempted to retain our business by offering us something, but never said what. The offer honestly could have been free dinner and beers, but I still would have walked out. 

As far I as I'm concerned, City Works' opportunity to serve me dinner came and went and it will not come again. I will not return.

I see many positive Yelp reviews, so it may be a great place, but until management figures out how to manage their restaurant, it won't achieve its full potential."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Server was on point.  Went for an away pens game and they let way too many people in the bar.  Their bar staff couldn't handle the customers.  The space got way too crowded and as a result my table waited over 30 minutes on multiple occasions for a beer, simply a beer. Only open a short time but you really need to get your act together for the customers or you'll lose them."}
{"text":"If you like craft beer on draft this is a good place to stop. I'd guess around 80 beers on draft. Don't think they have bottled beer but they do have liquor. Food was ok. Had the chicken sandwich liked the fries better. Large place, clean and modern. Good for families or friends. Nice place."}
{"text":"Had drinks and flatbread on a Saturday afternoon. Great atmosphere with skylights and open patio. Beers a little pricy but worth it for the selection of 80+ drafts"}
{"text":"This place is a total cluster fuck. It's like everyone is in la-la land. 
First, it took FOREVER to get a drink order in, then they totally forgot one person all together. Then drinks were brought, one person still hadn't even got to order. Once ordered, brought wrong drink.
Suddenly food started coming but they hadn't even taken half the tables orders. Forgot foods, forgot sides. When asked, they'd say they would return with correct food, then would forget. Completely forgot one entire order and when asked \"oh, I forgot to tell you, we were out of it\". Seriously, come on! We were more than patient and more than kind. Left decent tips regardless of this shitty service and food, but we definitely won't return and will definitely let others know how much they are lacking."}
{"text":"Slow service. Went for lunch on a Wednesday. Waited 40 minutes for 4 identical salads and 2 sandwiches. CityWorks salad was OK - chicken was a bit dry and under seasoned. Fried chicken sandwich and filet sliders were good. 

Even though our server acknowledged the food took a long time and was aware of our time crunch, she was slow in getting and processing our checks."}
{"text":"Pretty good selection of beer to choose from. Came here for dinner and had no problem getting a table. Large indoor seating, as well as tables out on their patio area.

I consider myself very picky when it comes to fries, but these were delicious--I prefer soft over crunchy fries.  Will definitely come back often."}
{"text":"Charged for double shot of liquor when ordered a single.

Third visit here. Always seated fast but takes a long time for waitress to come to table. Based on the menu listing liquor is served by ounces, your typical single or double shot. Ordered a single shot neat. Other drink order at the table was the same but on the rocks. After a long wait both drinks came on the rocks. No biggie so I believed plus drinks took too long to come. When received total bill all drinks were charged at the double shot/ounce rate of $12. When I asked why,  the waitress explained that because the drinks were on the rocks that they had to make it a double. When I explained that I never ordered ice, and that this should've been explained, as the menu makes no reference to the price being based on ice with the drink or not, she agreed that she should've explained when I ordered and offered to have a manager speak with me. The manager explained that the price I was charged was not based on the ice but instead that I did not order a mixer with the drink. He explained that if you order a drink straight you have to get a double. If order a drink with a mixer you have to get a single shot. When I asked him to explain why that is not specified on the menu he agreed that it should be. When I asked if it's not then why aren't servers mandated to explain to customers he acknowledged that they should. At this point I asked if I could be charged the lesser rate for each drink and he stated no. When I explained that their charges on my bill were deceptive and unfair he simply informed me that nothing could be done. I also explained that I ordered the same drink on a previous visit and was charged the single shot rate. He stated he could not change the bill. I had not yet started to drink my last drink so I then asked if he could take it back as I was unwilling to pay for it. He informed me that he could not because it was already poured and now contaminated and they could do nothing with it. At this point I told him that he either had to remove my last drink that I had not started to drink or call the police as I was not going to pay any portion of the bill unless it was removed. He agreed to remove it. I paid the double ounce price  for all other drinks even though when I ordered that is not what I ordered. The waitress then asked me if he helped and I explained to her that he did not. She informed me that the next time I came that she would provide fantastic service. I informed her that unfortunately I would not be returning."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly underwhelmed by my lunch experience at City Works. Service was slow, and the salad I ordered (City Works salad) was small and unsatisfying, especially considering the price tag. Hopefully they get their menu and service kinks worked out, because the space itself is very nice and has potential. Until then, I'll be skipping this spot and heading to one of the other many, better restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Repeatedly the slowest food service I've ever experienced! Have dined here several times both week day and weekends. Always under staffed and food service is extremely poor. Visited on Saturday and waited 55 minutes to have lunch brought to the table. I can't blame their server. She did the best she could with the tools provided to her . She was very apologetic.

Management needs to manage the kitchen and hire more servers."}
{"text":"I'll keep it simple. Great beer menu. Terrible food. We had two beers, an appetizer, a burger and a sandwich. $65. The burger was the perfectly shaped patty that screamed premade/frozen. The buffalo chicken dip was barely warm. Probably awesome for happy hour but don't stay for dinner."}
{"text":"We tried this place out last Sunday night and it was great! There was a Penguins game on and you could follow the game from anywhere in the building! Our server Evin, was awesome! We tried the buffalo shrimp and cheese curds as suggested and were very happy. I had the duck reuben and my boyfriend had the ribs...the ribs were out of this world!  We are very excited to have this place so close to home (we live downtown) and can't wait to enjoy the outside patio all summer long for baseball games! Go check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is brand new in Market Sq and it's already one of my favorites for happy hour! Big open spaces with ample natural light streaming through the windows make for a delightful & cheery experience. Plus their happy hour specials are the best in the square-- something like $4 craft drafts & half off wine and then there's some type of app special. It gets really crowded but it's energetic in a fun way and service is pretty good and attentive (especially considering the quantity of guests in there at any given moment.) I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great experience at a great new spot! We came during happy hour and had half off appetizers so we got the buffalo chicken dip and pretzels with beer cheese. Both were pretty good for restaurant quality food but then I was blown away by the filet mignon sliders. They were cooked exactly the way I ordered and had a lot of flavor. The horseradish sauce was a little light, but too much might have overpowered the flavor of the meat. The fries were also good and complemented the meal well. Very trendy vibe in the restaurant and the decor was very classy. There were lots of great options on the menu and it was so hard to decide but our waitress was very helpful in recommending several dishes! Throughout the meal she was also very attentive and made sure that we had a great experience! Can't wait to return soon and try something new!!"}
{"text":"The kind of large, soulless box I expect to find in the suburbs or the new Bldgs on the north shore. Very sad. 10 video monitors per patron, zero personality cavern. There may be a time and place for such an establishment but for it to be allowed to take a large prime spot is Market Square, which is characterized by charm and unique establishments, is a disappointing at best. If all you want is mediocre food and beer with 3,000 video screens to distract you from your human company and an environment with no warmth or character, you found it. Downtown Pittsburgh rapid growth - slow down - you can do much better.  This one is a shame."}
{"text":"I hate to even grade this a one star, however the system requires me to. This place was absolutely horrible!!! The people were rude from the servers to the front desk to the management. I would never ever go here again and advise you not to! Unbelievable the way they treat their customers!!"}
{"text":"I was booking a 10 person reservation for a casual work event and thought location to the hotels for out of towners and the beer selection ideal.  Called and the phone rang forever then put on hold forever. Luckily this gave me time to read the reviews.... not going to give them the opportunity to mess up our orders or give bad service. Once the reviews turn around I'll consider giving them a shot."}
{"text":"So I made a reservation with city works via email NOT open table for a Saturday night for my birthday. I arrive and I'm told open table shouldn't have let me reserve on a weekend. I never went though open table I contacted city works directly and showed them the email. The manager talked to me and honestly by his demeanor I felt like he could care less, he was rude and cold and a times like it wasn't on him to accommodate! However the host and hostess were great and accommodating they got a us a table made us first priority. The manager did comp our first drinks and some appetizers. The food and service were great. If it wasn't for the great host , hostess and waiter. This would've been a 1 star review based on a manger who acted like I didn't book directly with the restaurant and blames on an employee who happened to be off when we were there."}
{"text":"The smoked wings are KILLER! Can't recommend them enough!

Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"}
{"text":"Recommended by the Hotel we stayed at. Known for their craft beer selection. Over 90 on tap. I just wanted a Heineken. No luck. Coors light, bud light, corona, but seriously no Heineken. 

The menu looked light they were trying hard to be trendy. That requires flawless execution which we did not experience. Rosemary fries with a blah blah blah. None of it matters if the fries are cold. I had filet mignonette sliders also cold. They were tasty. 

The best item we had was the appetizer: fried dill pickle slices. Not so trendy but executed. They were a 10 with a beer batter that's awesome. Service was good. 

All in all if you miss this place you shouldn't regret it."}
{"text":"Just enjoyed a terrific graduation dinner celebration with a few other families at City Works.  Brandon set us up with a semi-private room off of the bar area that was perfect for our group of 12 (could have even fit a few more).  We were able to pre-order appetizers, ate, drank and mingled, then sat to order our dinners.  Dana, our server was attentive and fun! For any group looking for a way to celebrate their graduate, friends and family, this place was perfect!  The staff could not have been more accommodating and helped us to have a really enjoyable evening.  City Works is within walking distance of Duquesne University and we even had a welcome sign with the school logo!"}
{"text":"We could not wait to hit City Works! I love how open/spacious this establishment is.. this was on a Saturday night.. perfect night to watch the basketball game. . so intense (NC/Orgeon)
There are so many tv screens.. all different sizes that I even got caught up in the excitement if the game! We had no problems getting drinks and seats at the bar. 

I definitely want to go back and check out the food.. 

valet parking nearby made it a breeze too $10.00 .. sure why not!"}
{"text":"Definitely for sports fans! Such a great place to watch all those wonderful games with friends. The food there, well, we only tried two of the snacks. They were not so nice. But wine was good. I picked strawberry margarita, and it tasted wonderful. I just started my first day of exploration of the pubs, and this did make my night beautiful."}
{"text":"AWESOME place I was here on St.Patties day even on a day like that we still had great food and service. I have yet to make it back, however Im thinking it would be a great spot for game as they have SOOOOO many Tvs truely not a bad seat in the house. Plus they have a huge selections of beers too. I will be back in the near future for a late lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"Our experience got off to a bad start when we waited 15 minutes for a server to stop at our table after we had been seated. No drinks or any attention. Once we finally were waited on, our server didn't know much about the food on the menu, describing the entrees in very general terms when we asked questions. He described one entrees as a lettuce wrap with a tortilla on a bun. Once we finally received our food, our meals were very disappointing.  I could have gotten a better burger at any major chain.  

I can't see why anyone would choose to eat this food when there are so many great options for fantastic meals within walking distance from this place. 

Once we were finished, our server went missing and we had to wait another 15 minutes to get the attention of a different server for our check. 

The environment looks like a really cool sports bar when you walk in, but if you're looking for good food in Pittsburgh, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"A nice restaurant in a pretty good Market Square location. I've heard many things about this place being very pricey, but it was about what I had expected. The food was great, and the beer selection was insane! I think the wings were a big standout. Such a good smokey flavor, you don't find ones like that often. I ordered the Smokehouse Burger, and oh man it was excellent. Cooked perfectly, and so much flavor. Seems like City Works would be a great happy hour spot."}
{"text":"After about a year of my friend wanting to check this spot out, we decided to check it out and used Open Table to make a reservation since there were events going on in the city. We arrived on time and we're seated right away. Our service was good, with a waitress who was  helpful and attentive but not checking in too often. 

We had three people in our group. We started with drinks and shared the short rib poutine. With a huge list of beers on tap, we all found something to like. I don't care for most beers or ciders but they had some unique craft ciders to suit my picky taste. The poutine was delicious but the serving seemed a bit on the smaller side and all the ingredients were mixed together which seemed a bit out of the ordinary from what I usually expect poutine to look like (however I am not a poutine expert so this may be more common than I realize). 

For entrees, my friends chose burgers and I chose the beet salad which is listed as a \"starter\" salad since I wasn't too hungry. The friends ate up the fries which came with their burgers and had leftovers on the burgers. The fries were very nice, and I tasted a few and can agree they have some nice fries complete with a little sprinkle of herbs. I enjoyed the beet salad, which was very fresh, fairly large (especially considering it was listed as a starter), and had lots of beets. However, they list it has pecans but I barely had one pecan in my whole salad which was a little disappointing.

Overall, I enjoyed my time at City Works but it seems a little expensive for what it is offered. I would come back, most likely for happy hour which is listed from 4-6pm on weekdays."}
{"text":"This place is deceptively small from the outside. It's very large and spacious- the whole place is one big room. They had nice big horseshoe booths to sit at which was great for our group. Pretty reasonable in cost as well. 

The beer menu and drink menu was expansive, you shouldn't have trouble finding something you like or want to try; there is literally a drink for everyone! 

I liked the food menu as well. I could have gotten a number of things and probably been really happy. I settled on the fish tacos. Delicious! Warning: they do have a kick to them so if you are intolerant of spicy food then I'd check out on if the other choices. 

Waiter was attentive and chatty. The inky thing I didn't like was that he stood at the table and watched us tip him and he asked how much change I wanted back.  I'm a good tipper but I like my privacy when tipping hahaha"}
{"text":"Great food. 90 beers on tap. The service is quick. Try the ribs they are a full slab of perfection."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner and drinks with friends last night. The host was very friendly and welcoming. Our waiter Paul was FANTASTIC! He was personable, funny, attentive and offered great recommendations. We had the fried cheese curds as an appetizer which were delicious. They were very light and crispy. I had the filet mignon sliders which were cooked perfectly and the fries were perfectly flavored. I'm glad we ended up here on our one night in the city."}
{"text":"We stopped into City Works on a whim to escape the cold this past weekend. It was a Saturday afternoon which was the perfect time to go. They had a huge selection of beer on tap (they also offer wine on tap as well), a lot of big screen tv's (great for watching football, hockey, etc.) and a great looking menu. Since it was the middle of the afternoon we didn't order any entrees. But I did order the soft pretzels bites as an app and they were yummy. The order was a bit small so not ideal for sharing with a lot of people. But the beer and atmosphere was great. 
I deducted a star only because our service was a little slow but other than that I really enjoyed this place and I'm sure I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"1st time here and I liked it. In the heart of busy Market Square. We're getting kinda old so finding a good place to meet friends gets a little harder as time goes on :) There were families with kids, bachelorette parties, couples, small groups. Plenty of seating inside and out. The place is bright and just a little loud, but not so much that you can't talk. 
The beer list was extensive but has short descriptions of all the beers including alcohol content - a lot of interesting local brews. Also was nice that they offer a 6oz pour for all beers, so you can try some different ones without committing to a full glass. 
Food was nothing amazing, but it was good. Service was excellent- our server as well as other waitstaff were all very friendly and interacted well with customers. 
Overall we all enjoyed this place a lot. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Preface: I am in the service industry myself. If you give me even average service, I will at least tip 25-30%. 

City Works is a fantastic place IF you like to play hide and seek with your waitress. If you want food, or even a beer in less than 30 minutes, you should look else where.

We sat down in the outside area on a Sunday. Including us, there were probably 20 people total in the entire restaurant. After 10 minutes, a waitress appeared. We asked a simple question about an appetizer, which overwhelmed her. We gave her the benefit of the doubt, and just ordered a beer. A simple draft beer. 

Twenty five min passed.

I walked indoors, asking if anyone could get us water, beer, whatever. Embarrassed, the hostess said she'll send her right back out.

Five more minutes passed (we were her only table).

We calmly got up, and left. 

Summary? Maybe this place has good food? Possible, but we never got past getting poured a glass of water, much less a beer. 

We went across to diamond grill, ate, drank, and paid my bill before that waitress ever came back lol. ::Facepalm:: 

Just don't even come here. Don't."}
{"text":"The food is okay. It was tasty but everything we had was extremely salty! And I like salt..They have a decent beer selection and the ambience is nice. The service was pretty slow though. Given your options for happy hour downtown this is one of the better places, but still not worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"City Works is a very sub par within Pittsburgh. It is incredibly mismanaged. I have worked in ppg place for 10 years and was excited for a new happy hour and event location. Every time I have gone here which has been about 10 times, I have been disappointed. It is so close to my work I continue to give it a chance. I scheduled a team event with 25 people and they called two days before and said they couldn't accommodate us and had to fire their event manager...unprofessional. We made it work by going very early but come on. I went to happy hour at 3:45 and the hostess asked us if we were staying for happy hour which started at 4. Also asked if we all needed seats. The place was absolutely empty. They have a great location and beautiful facility. They need to get it together."}
{"text":"What a great addition to downtown! Came here for several happy hours with some coworkers. Once, we were lucky to score the private dining room and it made our experience a great and intimate one. Another time, we were able to get a table and it was equally as nice of an experience. Very attentive service both times!

I've tried a few of their appetizers and each were pretty good! I particularly enjoyed the duck confit nachos. You also can't go wrong with the giant pretzel. The large selection of drinks makes it versatile and accommodating to any drink preference. However, the largest selection is that for the beer so definitely stop here if you're particularly a beer drinker! Unfortunately, the happy hour specials for beer are only for a handful of those beers, so make sure you ask which ones are on special. For the wine drinkers, the wine specials during happy hour are half off any of the wines! Great deal, right?

This will probably be the new regular hang out place for my group of coworkers!"}
{"text":"This place is probably my favorite downtown after work Happy Hour spot. With a massive selection of beers on tap, phenomenal drink and food specials, and a massive set up of tvs, tables, and amenities its no wonder this place is as popular as it is. As I said before this place has a massive drink selection, from stouts to lagers to liquors this place has everything as well as a few beers you'd only be able to find here (due to agreements with breweries/special editions). That being said though, as phenomenal as the drink and food menu specials are my only gripe is with the food itself. Although not inherently bad, it basically is just the food you would get at Fridays except with better presentation to make it seem like its higher quality than it is. That being said though, I still recommend going here, like I said you wont be unhappy and you will certainly find something to drink as well as something to snack on."}
{"text":"Trendy, hip, super crowded and oh so slow!! 30 minute wait was expected on Saturday evening, but good service was excruciatingly slow. Hunter was sweet and the experience was promising. Amazing soft pretzel appetizer! Took about 15 minutes from order to receiving. Cheese sauce is incredible. She put in our fish tacos and steak sliders and we waited. And we waited. 45 minutes later, our orders arrived. Tea refills were super slow as well. His sliders were well seasoned and although just barely warm, fries were hot. The fish in the tacos was cold. No ketchup for fries and it seems understaffed. Hunter was super sweet but 2 hours for 2 people?!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food.  Highly recommend going here before or after a baseball game."}
{"text":"We came here before the pirate game on Sunday with a party of 10. The drink selections are great and they even have wine on tap! We had the firecracker rolls, spicy and unique and the calamari fried to perfection!! Our server was perfect, definitely be patient because your bar drinks will take some extra time."}
{"text":"Beer is expensive, along with food. Stopped in for a beer a few times to check it out. Last time I was going to try the food out but couldn't get over CNN on half of the TVs. Most people don't go to bars to have politics shoved down there throat. You are supposed to be a sports bar, show sports channels."}
{"text":"I went to City Works with a few friends for a late lunch over the holidays. It wasn't hard for us to get a seat - it's honestly so spacious inside! The menu and beer list had something for everyone, which was great for our group! 

I had a Carolina fried chicken sandwich. It was ok, but it wasn't anything to write home about. It also kind of tasted like it was sitting in the window for a little longer than it should have. Everyone else got burgers and seemed to enjoy their meal, so next time I would probably go that route. 

Our server was very friendly and helpful when we had questions, and really took the time to chat. There was an awkward exchange where he counted the money at our table to make change, and I felt weird about it. I said that I felt weird out loud, and he responded really well to it and we all laughed. Which was kind of nice. hahaha 

All in all, this place has a sweet beer list, and it's a great location if you are downtown exploring the city. The food was only decent, so that made my rating drop. I wouldn't write this place off though!"}
{"text":"PROS: Big space with lots of tables that would probably be good for large groups. There are a ton of TVs above the bar as well as scattered throughout the restaurant, so you won't miss any of the local games. Huge beer selection. Decent (if overpriced) appetizers. Service was pretty attentive except for when our waitress stepped out for a smoke.

CONS: Watch out for the prices. A friend was in town and we both had a tulip glass of Arsenal Picket Bone Dry cider, which is a local cider. They were $13 each, so we'd spent $26 on our first two drinks, which is more than the fancy cocktails cost. In their defense, the price was listed on the menu, but the since this is a local cider that retails for (~$6/glass at the Arsenal Cider House less than 3miles away, I was shocked at the price-gouging). The appetizer that I'd ordered (jalepeño poppers) were good if slightly overpriced. I also had a salad entree which was abundant and tasty. All told, I received a bill for $70 for the aforementioned cider, 3 beers, one appetizer, and one entree salad. 

SUMMARY: I'd recommend this place if you've got a large group and someone else is footing the bill, but smaller groups might be inclined to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great burgers but super expensive beer - $8 for 10 oz snifter of Ballast Point. Happy hour beers were for \"selected taps\" of which none were selected."}
{"text":"This is a fun place for anyone looking for a new location in Market Square (and a lot of beer!) With lots of TVs and a partial sky roof, the atmosphere is fun and inviting. Our service was mediocre and somewhat slow, but it was a very busy Friday night. The prices are expensive for what you get, but I really enjoyed my barbecue chicken salad. Additionally, the crab fondue shareable was incredible!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for happy hour. It's from 4-6 with $4 beers and 1/2 off wines. They have a huge drink menu with over 90 beers on tap. I am not a beer fan and I still enjoyed my time here. I had the Bottleneck Cosmo and a glass of Riesling. Our server was so great! He made the experience great. Be aware the music is loud. Ask for Abdul!"}
{"text":"For some odd reason, I couldn't remember why I was so \"eh\" about this place. At first glance, a place that touts itself as being a sports bar with a large craft beer menu always calls my name. As soon as I clicked to go to the business page, I found my friend's review that flipped the lightbulb immediately on why I feel the way I do about City Works.

My friend and I arrived about an hour and a half before the game to grab a drink and a light snack. While there were no seats at the bar, we were sat immediately at the end of a long table in the bar area. Our server came around and quickly grabbed our drink orders. We wanted to split an app, and she recommended the goat cheese flatbread. Our beers came quick and the flatbread followed soon after. It was fabulous!

After we received our flatbread, our waitress was nowhere to be found. We wanted another round before we headed off to the game, and although we placed the drink order quickly, it took nearly a half hour for the drinks to arrive. The time spent made us late to the game, and we couldn't even find our server within that time period to tell her never mind. The drinks are also on the expensive side. I purposely chose an 11% beer so I would feel like I was getting my money's worth. (Side note: bad idea.) They did hold onto my credit card, which I greatly appreciate.

I probably would have given 4 stars if my server was a little more present. Maybe I just received the short end of the stick. The food I received was delicious. If asked, I wouldn't rule out trying here again, but with Pittsburgh being a growing food & alcohol scene, they didn't wow me enough to prioritize going there again before trying somewhere new."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal here on Labor Day! Attentive service, great drink selection, and one of the best burgers I've had in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"City Works was much better than I expected. Went for happy hour on a Friday. Although it was packed there were still plenty of tables to sit. There are over 90 beers on tap, so a ton to choose from and they are $4 during happy hour. 
I found the food to be a bit pricey. I paid $15 for shrimp tacos. If they weren't so good I would complain more about the price.
Our waitress was super friendly and quick. We did not all arrive at once so every time another person in our party came she came right over. 
There are parking garages all around. Next time I will park a bit closer. I was in a garage on the blvd of the allies. My other friends parked at Golds gym. 
I will be back."}
{"text":"Good location, we loved the windows that completely opened to the outside.  The service was friendly, but the food was average."}
{"text":"There was a wait at the Harris Grill, so we settled on this place.  We got seated outside right away. It was still happy hour, so we got $4 cheese curds.  They came out pretty quickly and it was a big portion of fried cheese.  It was definitely cooked perfectly and the side of smoky tomato sauce was a tasty combination.  Our entrees were a little more on the average side.  We got the CIty Works Chopped Salad, The BBQ Chicken Salad and the Duck Reuben.  The City Works salad seemed small and insubstantial for the price, however, the taste of it was good.  The BBQ Chicken Salad was better, but still not the best combination. I could have done without the BBQ sauce, can just had regular seasoned chicken breast with all the other ingredients.  My friend liked the Duck Reuben, but thought there was too much cheese (his personal preference).  He prefers to taste the duck more than all the extras on it.   Overall the food is pretty tasty, but not exceptional.  We're not big drinkers, so we didn't try any of the beers or wines.  We would probably come back, but mostly for the fact that we can sit outside at Market Square and if other places are super busy and we can sit down quicker here."}
{"text":"Beautiful venue, strong beer selection and quality food. But 13oz craft beer pours?!?  C'mon.  You don't discount the beer by 15-20% but you pour 15-20% less liquid.  That's just dirty."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Market Square, City Works is a great hang out spot and restaurant that has something called the beer Bible, over 98 beers on tap as well as wine on tap. Yes, you read that correctly - wine on tap. It's delicious. Of course, I had to try for myself. It would only be fair to my Yelp followers :-). I arrived ari 6 o'clock on a Thursday evening, I was with a colleague and we were able to walk right in. We were seated right away, but nobody came up to us for about 10 minutes. It seemed as though they were a little bit understaffed. A lovely girl named Rachel helped us and she was wonderful. Both the hostess & server asked if it was our first time and they explained the entire menu. We also got there during happy hour. Happy hour is during the week from 4 to 6 PM. They have discounted drink prices as well as four dollar appetizers on the happy hour menu. We decided to get pretzel bites to start out with & we each got a drink. My colleague ordered the salmon as I ordered the seared ahi tuna salad. We waited for quite a bit, and our pretzel bites came out with our food. Truly not the order we wanted. We wanted this pretzel bites to come out as an appetizer because it is-followed by our meals. When my salad got there I no longer wanted the pretzel bites. The salad was delicious. Heavy on the lettuce, but had a decent amount of tuna. They also put crispy strips on it which I wasn't a fan of and if I went back for that salad I would have them hold the crispy's. There was a good mix of almonds, cabbage, avocado, and lettuce in there. My colleagues salmon looked delicious and he said it was great. Overall, it was a good experience. We were there for less than an hour and a half. The prices are really reasonable. Our bill was $60 before tip. It took a while to get our check, but I think it's because our server was busy with other tables. I'm sure it would be a better experience if they weren't so understaffed, but the food wasn't bad. The environment was fun, the place was busy and the wine on tap was delicious and plentiful. Everything was super affordable. I am not sure about the parking situation because we walked, but it is nestled in Market Square so you might have to find public parking."}
{"text":"Great selection beers. The Kentucky Bourbon Ale has a perfect hint of bourbon flavor. The buffalo chicken eggs rolls weren't so great. Has a lot of TVs to watch the games."}
{"text":"I had the buffalo shrimp app and the salmon entree. The shrimp was fried and dipped in a buffalo sauce. The sauce was not to spicy.  The salmon was very buttery. The whole dish was extremely buttery. Wayyy to much butter. Whoever was cooking thought they were Paula Deen lol"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place for viewing sports events, with many large screens behind the bar, so if you're lucky to get a seat at the bar you will have a good view of the screens. 

The beer selection is fairly large, with many craft beers to choose from. The one thing I missed in the beer list was an indication of how many ounces they pour for the different beers. I wasn't sure with the IPAs that I ordered whether they were 12 or 16. This made it a little hard to price compare. 

They have some interesting selections on their food menu, and I ordered the Carolina fries chicken sandwich, one of their specialties. I was a little underwhelmed. For $13, it was a little on the small side, and the fried chicken breast was maybe two thirds of the size of the bun, so after I got a little ways through eating the sandwich I was left with just eating pure bun (or leaving it uneaten). The bun also wasn't heated. 

I came during happy hour and their specials are not quite as extensive as you see at some other places. They had $4 drafts on a select list of beers (not across the board). The bartender will list the beers for you that are on special but it was a little hard to remember them. It would have been nice to have them listed."}
{"text":"This was my first visit at City Works and the layout is great. We had a party of 12 so they provided us with a private dining room in the front of the restaurant. Ryan our server was great with the exception of he disappeared for some time and we had to request that someone got him for us. The food was okay. I had the firecracker rolls and fish tacos. If you don't like spicy stay away from both. The slaw on the tacos were way to spicy for me and I found myself digging the filling out f the rolls and eating the shell with the wonderful avocado sauce. I would go back again and try some other food. The fries were great"}
{"text":"I really really liked City Works! We came here over Memorial Day weekend on a whim and it turned out to be a great place! Since it was so nice out, we sat on the patio which is a great location for people watching in Market Square. The inside of the restaurant also looked really nice and spacious. 

For drinks, I started with the basil lemonade. It was so pretty when she served it to me with a huge basil leaf! The taste of it was just OK for me- I couldn't really even taste the basil! We also ordered an app off the \"Bar Bites\" section of the menu- which I think just means they are smaller. Both Chris and I were swooning over the firecracker rolls! They were in an egg roll wrapper with spicy chicken and veggies inside and topped off with an avocado cream sauce. Seriously amazing! For our entrees, we both ended up ordering the fish tacos. It came with 3 breaded mahi-mahi fish tacos and chips and salsa. These were also amazing! I typically order grilled fish tacos so it was a nice change from my usual order. 

The only reason City Works didn't receive a 5 star for me is because of service. Our waitress wasn't very attentive to us so we didn't even end up ordering a second drink! Hopefully on our next visit (which there will be one!) we will receive better service."}
{"text":"Big space with a ton of t.v's and a ton of beer options. Great place to have a happy hour or watch the game. 

Not to be petty buttttt, we ordered shrimp tacos about 10 minutes before the couple next to us and their tacos came out about 10 minutes before us. So, a slight mix up. No biggy. Then as we were eating our tacos, a second order of tacos came out by mistake. So they are still working some kinks out.

That said, tacos were good.  Menu was a lot of just fried type bar foods mostly.  So overall, a good spot for a drink and some apps but I wouldn't suggest going here for a dinner.  If I could give 3.5 stars, that's what I'd do."}
{"text":"Was at City Works a few weeks ago and I was gonna give them 3 stars despite the shitty service nasty sliders and watered down beer but I seen a full fist fight break out between a server and customer. Is this the kind of restaurant that Bottleneck Management wants in their business? They need to re-evaluate the staff and quality of food or the people who cook it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good food this is not the place you want to go to. The food was very subpar and the service was horrible. My burger wasn't cooked and my friends chicken sandwich was taken back three times. Our waitress also gave attitude when we complained about the cold chicken. Only come here for drinks."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is cool and space is very hip but unless you want to taste all 90 beers on tap don't waste your time or money. Food has no flavor, portions are average prices are high and service is well below what you would expect in Market Square."}
{"text":"HUGE beer selection! Killer vibe. Staff and service on point.  Every food item I tasted was fantastic. Great for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Was here for March madness last weekend.... crazy!   Big ol tvs with the games on and music and funny you tube videos playing in the background.   I got a flight of sweet baby Jesus,  banana bread beer, Neapolitan stout,  and bumble berry....soooooo good.  Pretty big flight too, I was feeling it.    Anyhow,  I ate before I got there so I didn't really eat but i did try the pretzel bite things with beer cheese of course.   They have 90 beers there,  all different.... You can see I made my own little categorized flight.... which was bomb.   But the place is just fun... oh... and I had a wing,  which was amazing,  smoky and yummy. 
Anyhow,  market square needed some spot like this...check it out, you'll dig it."}
{"text":"So we arrive on a Saturday evening and get a table right away. The place is half full and we are greeted by a very friendly waitress. She gives us a short background of the place and we order an appetizer and drinks. My wife orders a blue moon with an orange   The waitress offers us waters along with our drinks and we accepted. The Blue Moon arrives without the orange and she apologizes for forgetting our waters. Well a few minutes later she arrives and still does have the waters. Then my wife asks for the orange that she never received and the waitress replies \"you're going to have to give me a few minutes for that\". Okay. So then I see two waters headed our way and she gives them to the table next to us. By the way, that table arrived AFTER us. So we decide that we are leaving due to the bad service and start to walk to the front of the restaurant to pay for our blue moon.  The waitress begins to chase us saying we can't walk out on the bill. Really.  So we ask for a manager and she says she's going to get one. We run into a guy who said he was a manager. I told him what happened and he says \"maybe she was overwhelmed\". As I mentioned earlier the place was not that busy. So I asked the manager for the bill and he says don't worry about and I said \"I won't\". Needless to say I won't be back."}
{"text":"The place has nothing special, on the other hand, it takes them a life time to serve food. We waited for over more than one and a half our to get our burgers... unacceptable"}
{"text":"Made reservations for 5:30 on a Saturday.  Probably didn't need to, but trying to cash in on my Open Table account.  Bar was pretty full for the PSU game, but restaurant section was sparse. I would imagine this places gets wild for a Steelers game

 Let me go back, there is really no distinct difference between bar and seating, just a small divider about 4 feet high.   You can see TVs from everywhere. This is an all around high end sports bar, with high end beer and their take on bar food.  Menu is high end bar food with some regular bar items.  Burgers, fried items and then some more \"mature\"entrees for your more high end bar goers.  Our burgers were cooked to order with fresh buns and toppings.  Lotsa smoky flavor on the City Works Burger.   Service was a little spotty, but nothing to complain about.

Extra baby star for short pour prices on beers.  I like the fact that I could just get a short and I wasn't being a pain or asking a favor."}
{"text":"Four stars because it's good, the happy hour is decent, but you never know what you're going to get service wise. Is your server having a bad day and can't be bothered to give a shit about their customers? Or do you get a seasoned professional? Literally you don't know until you sit down. But it's a fun atmosphere, especially on game days and their chicken firecracker rolls are dope."}
{"text":"I'm  not typically a fan of chains, but this is a fairly small one (for now) and we thourougly enjoyed our experience here. 90 beers  on tap?? what?  I'm a craft beer lover and work for Brew: The Museum of Beer, so I think I know a bit about craft beer. I was impressed by the selection, especially the fact that they have a decent  amount of local breweries' brews and will  continue to do so.  Alexis was our waitress and she was friendly attentive and upbeat.  We also met  Tyler the bar manager who took the time to talk  to us for a while.  I had the mahi mahi tacos.  They were great. I must admit they came out cold the first time and  I  had to send them back, but I got the replacement meal in a flash. My cousin had the pork  chop and said it was pretty darn good! I'll  be back!"}
{"text":"Our server Hunter was amazing. The beer selection is great and the food was pretty good. If you go, sit in Hunters  section. She rocks. Plus she smoking HOT too."}
{"text":"I've always been kind of a fan of city works but after tonight's mishap I think they have lost a customer for life. Knowing that it was a busy night in the city I figured I'd call ahead and make a reservation. I was told by the person on the phone that there was no wait and when there was no wait they would not take reservations. I then hop in an Uber and get down to city works no more than 25 minutes later. I walk in and was told that there was an hour wait. I explain to the guy how I just got (for a lack of better terms) screwed because I tried to make a reservation but was refused due to me wanting a reservation for 30 minutes in advance. I was then told to leave after telling him my displeasure with what just happened. Overpriced food and their BBQ sauce underwhelms, which is what they pride themselves on. We just wanted to go for the atmosphere and beer selection, not their subpar food. If you like poor customer service this is your place, enjoy."}
{"text":"Stopped into this place for some quick apps. We got the duck nachos, cheese curds, and firecracker rolls. The nachos were spot on and the highlight of the meal. The cheese curds were lack luster but we had high expectations being from Wisconsin. The firecracker rolls were pretty good and filling too. We thought it was pretty fair prices but nothing exceptional. This place was recently opened so they have some service issues to figure out but they were really attentive and tried to make up for it."}
{"text":"I met up with an old friend for lunch, and specifically requested we go here specifically because the website stated that they had Stone's Xocoveza (that delicious Mexican Hot Chocolate inspired Stout!), but alas, they said they had JUST run out.
Fortunately, I was turned on to Southern Tier's Imperial Cinnamon Roll Ale during my visit. That's probably the highlight of my visit.
It's not that the food wasn't delicious. It was!... however, I feel like I can easily find comparable quality food and similar beers for much more reasonable prices.
The Firecracker Rolls we ordered were good, but almost TOO spicy to eat. I'm a spicy food lover too. For reference, I usually order a Spice Level of 7 or 8 at Thai Restaurants. We went through a glass of water and part of a refill each while tackling these, and there was not enough avocado cream to help manage them. While eating these, both of us voiced regret at having ordered spice-based drinks.
The Thai Chicken wrap was very good too, but again, it wasn't outstanding. My favorite thing I ate was the Sesame Ginger dressing that I chose for my side salad. The flavors in it were exquisite!
I tried a bite of my friend's Carolina Fried Chicken Sandwich too. It was good, but... missing something. I'm not sure what would have made this better. I even tried a bite with one of the pickles that come with it. Hmmm...
Conclusion: This place does have pretty good food, but I'd go elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Great location and beer selection!  Food was above average, but a little pricey.  Great meeting place"}
{"text":"Downtown definitely needed a place like this- tons of huge televisions make it perfect to watch a sports game and they had over 50 beers on tap! We visited on a Wednesday for some late night drinks and snacks. Most of their beers are written on the menu and on their large drink board, however there were some seasonals that were not listed. I had to ask two servers what the seasonal beers were and neither of them knew without having to go to the bar to ask. I hate to be picky, but I do think that a place that wants to specialize in beer should ensure their servers at least have the seasonal beers written down somewhere so they can ask simple questions like that. Otherwise, the servers were pleasant and provided great service. I ended up choosing Space Dust by Elysian Brewing, which is always a good choice. For snacks, we went with the buffalo chicken dip and bier cheese and pretzels off of the late night menu. They were both very good, although some chicken pieces in the dip were much too big to eat with a chip. I guess that proves it's house made though, which is a good thing. The bathrooms were pretty gross, as a side note. Overall, I would return for a game and to check out their dinner menu. Hoping I am more impressed when I come back!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both times it was disappointing to say the least.  Both time they messed up the orders of people in our party and those that did get the correct order were not pleased with the quailty."}
{"text":"Seated us quickly. Waiter was very swift and friendly. Huge craft beer selection for the guys, but also a wide selection of cocktails. I had the strawberry margarita and it was very good. A bit loud but what else would you expect with large crowds"}
{"text":"I went here on a Sunday evening on a recommendation from a friend who told me to go when it's not crowded because their service wasn't the best. I walked in and there were several open tables and many open seats at the bar. There was no one on either side of me, yet it took them 10 minutes just to ask if I wanted a drink. After that, it took them 12 minutes to pour a cider. When I ordered the Carolina Fried Chicken sandwich, it took 33 minutes for me to get it. On a Sunday evening when it wasn't crowded. I never give a bad reviews, but this was ridiculous. Two stars because the sandwich was delicious."}
{"text":"It gets 2 stars because the workers at the hostess stand were very helpful and accommodating. That, the beer selection, and sports on TVs keep this from being 1 star.

We were visiting Pittsburgh and were looking for a place to watch a sporting event. City Works came up in my search so we decided to try it. We were just going to sit at the bar and have some beers and watch TV, unfortunately the bar was full. Went back to hostess stand and asked for a table in the bar area. They sat us outside the bar, but we were fine with that. When they put us at a table where not both of us could see the TV we wanted we were moved, and they changed a TV closer to us to what we were watching. Great. And that is the great ended.

Our service, in a word, was horrendous. In more than a word... We waited like 15 minutes for our server to first come to our table. Okay, we weren't in a hurry, so not a huge deal. But our server actually never came back to our table on his own. We always had to flag him down. When he brought our drinks and food he said nothing. No, here. No, do you need anything. Just, nothing. Just set it down. We'd say thank you every time and get nothing in return. No response whatsoever.

All my servers start at 15 percent, then depending on the service that goes up or down. This was one of maybe 3 times in my life that it got down to 10. I'll take into account if a server is busy and things take a while, but this server was barely at any of his tables. And the lack of any kind of hospitality on his part just couldn't redeem the place for me. 

Oh, the server that filled our water glasses was great... smiling, joking with us, so kudos to her."}
{"text":"Food isn't that great, overpriced. Excellent wait staff and choice of adult beverages. Carolina chicken was so so, too much dressing I the salad, stuffed peppers were too rich and not that tasty"}
{"text":"I've been here several times for lunch and after-work drinks with friends, and I usually suggest it for the latter because it's the earliest starting Happy Hour of any downtown restaurant/bar that I know of.  (4pm as of the time of this writing.)  It's spacious, well lit by the skylights above, and has a decent patio with a direct view of Market Square.  Service has always fine to me, and if you enjoy beer, this is the place for you because at any given time they have several dozen on tap.  Most of the good craft brews aren't on the HH special, though, so be sure to ask your server before you make any assumptions.  The fried pickle appetizer is a crowd-pleaser. It's a solid up-level sports bar."}
{"text":"City Works has superb service and absolutely fantastic service.

The venue itself is uncomfortable. I feel like I'm in a hotel lobby. There is just something about it that feels disconcerting.

The beer selection is huge. Plenty of beer options.

The food selection is standard bar food. Think Cheesecake Factory. They make good food, it just lacks soul.

This is a safe and reliable choice for someone picky or a large group. Not for foodies or hipsters."}
{"text":"Where should I start.  Probably the worst restaurant experience I have had in the city of Pittsburgh.  First of all our soup,  salad,  appetizer,  and entree all came out at the same time.  Then my girlfriends salad was supposed to be a BBQ chicken salad and was far from it.  So they took that same exact salad into the back and added onion rings in an attempt to make it the salad she wanted.  It was still the wrong salad.  Now it was the wrong salad with onion rings on top.  So the bartender took it into the back again and we waited for drink refills for 10 min.  It turns out our drink service was lousy for 10 minutes because he decided to stay in the back and  eat the salad. It gets better, he then walked out from the back with salad plate in hand just chomping away while STILL not refilling our beverages. It was hard to believe our eyes.   Next I got a sub par Thai chicken wrap.  It came with stale tortilla chips instead of the fries.  And when we commented on their lousy service and overall experience,  the bartender ignored us for refills,  again.  Like we did something wrong.  The manager didn't take care of anything and actually hid from us as we left.  Thanks Allen,  for the help.  So we went to 5 guys for burgers after wasting $64.00 of my hard earned money.  Do yourself a favor and pick a different restaurant at market square Unless you feel like paying to eat a second dinner. However,  since they get one star I will mention a positive.  They have a great beer selection and lots of TVs.  That's about it."}
{"text":"Only came here for drinks around 9 Pm on a Thursday. Impressive bar and great service. Also the bartender knew what tf she was talking about with every suggestion and she let us know what was out of stock and good comparisons. 

We didn't come for food so can't give any reviews on that.

But as an out of towner, I am so happy to stumble upon this."}
{"text":"It is a great happy hour! The drinks were good I had the Dutch mule and the summer storm, both were delicious but not on the happy hour menu. I got fried pickles that were ok but had salt on them that they didn't need. Server was awesome and talked to us for awhile!"}
{"text":"Parking is not convenient, he restaurant has a Really cool atmosphere, but the food wasn't very high quality. More than likely, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Very very large bar located in Market Square. My boyfriend and I stopped by after Light Up Night so it was extremely crowded! Since the venue was so large, we were still able to make it to the bar and find some standing room. The drinks were okay, although not the best cocktails we've had. We also tried a few of the brews - there were many to choose from! A little more expensive, but given the location it is understandable. Lots of screens inside as well playing a variety of things like music videos, sports, etc. The food looked like it was presented pretty nicely, although we didn't try any while we were there. They have a nice section outside with plenty of heat lamps as well."}
{"text":"FABULOUS! From the cranberry mojito to the 90 different beers ON TAP! Had the pork chop with the potato purée and chipotle maple glaze w/ cinnamon spiced apples and buttermilk onion strings. After recently visiting Michael Simon's Lola in Cleveland, this is far superior and half the price. Service was just a good!"}
{"text":"Right around the corner from my workplace, Cityworks fits the bill for that team lunch or work happy hour that really isn't much about the food or drinks but a checkbox that mandates your attendance despite that. I can't see myself picking it for any other reason besides proximity to work! It's not that I've had a terrible experience but nothing really stood out for me. I don't particularly like being squashed into their awkward semicircular booths. Somehow our party of 6 always finds itself in one of these semicircular booths. Their cocktails are ok - nothing memorable. They've limited vegetarian options so I usually get their wild mushroom bread which has been wildly inconsistent in terms of flavor. I liked it the first time but the last time it was a bit burnt and almost crunchy tostada like. Service is polite but on the past two occasions I was there, they mixed up orders. So all in all - Meh!"}
{"text":"We had the smokehouse burger and the fried chicken sandwich. The food was great. Beer selection was huge! Over 90 beers on tap.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Nice upscale new sports bar in Pittsburgh's always electric Market Square. The building is huge with a lot of seating both indoors and out. Great spot to watch a game as there are massive tv's everywhere. The menu wasn't as large as I expected so I was kind of limited on options. I got a bacon cheeseburger which was cooked to my liking and overall pretty good. My buddy got an order of the smoked wings and they were outstanding. The wings come with 2 different BBQ sauces, 1 spicy and 1 sweet, both are ridiculously good. Another member of our party got buffalo shrimp and raved about it. City Works has a huge beer selection that we were all pleased with. The service left a lot to be desired (slow, forgot drinks) but I can't really hold that against them as it's only been open a month or so and it was a Pens playoff game. All in all, pretty good spot with decent food and beer."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is sleek and classy, but the food is subpar. I got the shrimp tacos and the tortillas were soggy and cold. However, we did order the Buffalo chicken dip as an appetizer and that was great! Nice place, but the food is expensive for the quality you receive."}
{"text":"I struggle with finding places that are safe for me to eat because I am allergic to so much so I easily get nervous when trying new restaurants. I had gone ahead and made a reservation for my group. While waiting on my party to arrive, we ordered pretzel bites along with a few drinks. The pretzel bites were fantastic along with the selection of drinks. I ordered fish and chips & absolutely loved it. I highly suggest this place!"}
{"text":"Food is acceptable, my experience with the service has been good, but the dozens of draft crafts and devotion to local craft promotion is the big draw."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today, a Saturday afternoon. Very pleased with the service and everyone was pleased with their meals. The actual space is awesome. There really are no other restaurants like this downtown - simple, modern, open, airy. It was a very enjoyable experience. Will return."}
{"text":"5 yes, 5 average size shrimp for $15......server was indifferent, not attentive (as reflected in my tip).....Experiences here are inconsistent"}
{"text":"I'm confused by CityWorks as it seems to be in the throes of an identity crisis. While marketed as a sports bar with 90 or so beers on tap and multiple large screen TVs... the menu doesn't match... nor does the occasional DJ spinning giving it more of a nightclub feel. 

I understand the modern day sports (wo)man may have a more sophisticated palate... I'm not sure they're interested in duck confit as they're watching the Steelers and chugging beers. Aside from my opinion of the menu vs atmosphere, the menu lacks uniformity and consistency - it feels like a weird mix of items.  Also the three or so times I've been there, the food has come out long after we ordered. 

The plus side is the food is good and there is a lot of space."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre.  Service was ok.  One positive note is that they had a great beer selection.  Would only come again for a happy hour, not for dinner."}
{"text":"They have a decent beer list....that's about it! They do serve food but it takes ages to get it & it's subpar food. If you're lookin for a dining experience skip it, if ya just need a good beer & to watch a game, you'll be fine. Really, awfully slow service. No lime in a vodka tonic, wtf."}
{"text":"This place had a lot of promise, or so we thought when we walked through the square and were drawn in by how open this place was. Everything about the place was pretty cool as we entered and was seated, we even got some recommendations from the greeter. 

Once we got in and placed our order things changed a little. 

I asked for a beer in a pint glass rather than a snifter. Personally I prefer not a snifter and tulip, but would take anything else. I was told that I would not be served my beverage so I then pruned back my order to just an entree rather than getting an app. 

I ordered the cracked pepper burger or whatever and asked for medium, it came out well done. NOT EVEN CLOSE. 

On top of that our server was a little rough, not very pleasant. I will say the other servers around us were really nice. I would have rather had anyone else. 

Try some other place in the square first, not this place that is too snobby to serve a customer.

Update!- they keep reaching out months later with no plan nor reparations. They've logged the issue which the manager clearly doesn't understand. Maybe new managers would help the place out since carina and Lee can't figure it out. It's a shame I can't rate lower because they don't deserve one star"}
{"text":"Overall the experience was good, massive space with lots of TV's. 90 craft draft beers to try with about a quarter of them being local/ regional but a few fake craft national beers. Food selection was decent and everyone enjoyed what they ordered. Prices were what you'd expect for downtown but I still have a hard time with a $15 hamburger!"}
{"text":"Great burgers beers and drinks. I recommend the salmon. Mom got a good chicken salad Jeff got a good bacon burger."}
{"text":"Stopped in for drinks and to watch football. The beer was cold and a great selection.   We had the best server ever named Jill.  She was hilarious and had our entire table laughing.  We all agreed that she was the best server we have ever had any where.  Give this girl a raise, she is very deserving and an asset to your establishment.  Steelers fans from Montana and Idaho!!"}
{"text":"There aren't many great places to watch a game downtown, and City Works offers just that. They have a ton of TV's and they're huge! I work downtown, and stopped here prior to a Pirates game for Happy Hour. They have $4 select drafts as well as $4 select apps. Given that it's downtown, I thought it was a pretty good Happy Hour price. I think it'd be a perfect place for an after work group Happy Hour, so I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour here. They have both drink and food specials. We had the fried pickles which were great! I would definitely go back here for their happy hour."}
{"text":"Had lunch and the service was very slow the food took a long time Hunter my server was all over the place couldn't get it together and seemed very rude I would not be going back again unfortunately this is a new place but they're not going to be doing very well I would suggest not going there. Long waits for service long waits for food very high prices"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. The service, not so much. If you come here for happy hour, expect a long wait to be seated, served & to close out your tab."}
{"text":"We went there twice, once new years eve and once tonight. Cocktails are not good. This was true at both events. The city work burger is mediocre, the rib on the appetizer is good. The fried calamary and the duck nachos are great. The plates over all are small so don't think that you are going to be full by them (note that those low prices are because of the size).

Their service is fast, the place and restrooms are very clean."}
{"text":"Went to City Works on their opening day, definitely will return! Great beer selection and enjoyed the food, although the menu was limited because it was St. Patrick's Day Saturday. Thought the staff did an amazing job despite the huge crowd and it was their opening day. I think our server's name was Alan, he did an exceptional job. Hope to return soon and see what the rest of the menu looks like."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER THE FILET MIGNON SLIDERS.  While they sound and even look appetizing, they are terrible especially considering the price.  The meat is chewy and dry.  Really wish this place would get consistent with their food because the atmosphere is so fun."}
{"text":"Watched the Pens game here. The atmosphere was awesome!!!! It was super packed and slightly hard to get served.  I don't know that I would really recommend coming for any other occasion though."}
{"text":"GET THE PRETZELS AND BEER CHEESE. AND THEN GET MORE BEER CHEESE. 

Ok...now that's out of the way... I've had lunch here a few times and would definitely recommend it! It's a HUGE place in Market Square, so I imagine there are not many times throughout the day that you'd have much of a wait to get seated.

I've had a few dishes here. For the apps, I'd definitely recommend the pretzels and beer cheese, as previously stated, as well as the friend pickles. I've had the Peppercorn burger and the Fried Chicken sandwich and was very happy with both. You can easily get a great lunch for around $15.

During my latest visit, our server was Demond and he was an absolute joy! We were seated in one of the private rooms near the bar and he was extremely attentive throughout our entire meal. The manager, Bobby, even came out to check on us and make sure everything was OK. Our service was marvelous, especially for it being such a busy place. Thanks, Demond & Bobby!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink with a family member. We waited forever for a drink, $11 a piece, which tasted watered down. One sip, and already having been waiting for a long time, decided we didn't want to stay. The food may be spectacular, but for somewhere not busy and with such an expansive bar you expect better drinks and faster service. Especially in Pittsburgh. A lot of employees stood around due to not being busy. Paid for the one drink, cancelled our appetizer, and left. Totally disappointing. Worst $11 I've ever spent, honestly.

Also, tried to order a drink and they were out of the liquor on a Friday... don't recommend a drink if you don't have it! Also, who doesn't stock their bar in time for Friday?"}
{"text":"Tried a couple of office happy hours here. Used to bring clients from out of town here. Always had a bad experience. I actually had a waiter put his hands on me, attempting to escort me back to my table. All because you can't order a drink from the bar if your seated at a table. Put his hands on me!"}
{"text":"I love a good beer selection so I was excited to check this place out. Plus it's in market square! 

The beer selection was nice but not super unique. It had a nice variety to appeal to most beer drinkers but if you are looking for something new, this might not be the place. 

We stopped in for lunch but I wasn't very hungry so I ordered the chopped salad. When it came out, I was a little underwhelmed with how it looked but it was delicious! I actually thought about it for the next week. 

Everyone else in my group seemed to really enjoy their food. I would definitely stop back in the next time I'm in market square."}
{"text":"Update: Down to one star, which is what it needed all along. This place just has problems. Below is the old review. 


I give two stars only because of management's positive response to a service disaster. I doubt we will return, all the same. 
We have been to City Works three times. 
The first time was for drinks outside and it was fine. The prices are a little high, even for Market Square. 
The second time was for a light meal and though service was slow, everything went generally well. The food is average. 
We went for a light meal, our third visit. The place wasn't busy. 
The three of us were seated quickly, then waited. We placed a drink order, then waited a long time. 
We placed a food order. The appetizer, fried pickles, arrived quickly and was good. A little expensive at $7 for the size, but good. 
The food order apparently went into limbo and the waitress was in the witness-protection program. 
After a long wait, I tried to find her. No luck. 
I asked a hostess to help. A host came over, then the manager. 
The food order finally arrived. The macaroni and cheese was good, the shrimp tacos were greasy and left unfinished, and the third order was so fouled up by the waitress that I ended up having French fries as dinner and sent the rest back. 
The manager returned, erased our bill and gave us a gift card for a future visit. 
He and the hostess and host did all they could but it was a lousy night. 
If you go: make it clear up front that you can't wait forever. This wasn't European-style relaxed dining. 
We endured a service disaster on the night before we took our son to college and it ruined the night. 
I'm not one to complain, stuff happens, but the waitress basically showed contempt for the customers and that's not acceptable.

P.S. They were out of the beer I ordered so I then ordered the house beer. They were out of the house beer too! On a MONDAY!"}
{"text":"Awesome sports bar and great food. We were able to be seated at a nice two person booth for dinner and also watch the basketball games. Great selection of food and beers and loved the space in general. Server and staff was attentive and friendly. Will be back!"}
{"text":"My waiter Ryan was great and provided quality customer service during my client meeting today! We ordered the Tuna and City Works Salad and both were great options. The atmosphere of this place is very nice."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Expensive for small pours. Bartenders with horrible social skills."}
{"text":"City Works is by far my favorite place to go for a drink with friends. They have a great beer menu and there are TVs everywhere so it's good place to watch sports games. The overall atmosphere is awesome. 

The only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because the service isn't very good. Almost every time I've been here service is really slow, even after ordering it takes way to long to get the drink. But I love the atmosphere and beer variety so much I don't mind the wait."}
{"text":"I had a really delicious salad here for luch.  Since it was early in the day and very slow inside, it came out quickly.  I got the steak salad which was really good. The meat had a little fat that I needed to trim off which I feel like, in a salad, I shouldn't have to do, and it looked a little mangled, but it was still delicious. 

They have a really amazing beer menu, and if I hadn't been going back to work, I probably would have tried a couple.  

The reason I'm giving only 3 stars is because it's REALLY pricey for bar food.  I had a salad and water and after an average tip and taxes, my total was over $22.  Not sure I'd do that regularly."}
{"text":"The space is really nice. The TVS would be great for watching any event! The beer list is sorted by type which I personally loved! The food was hit and miss. Hence the 4 stars. We didn't love everything but some items were great. Absolutely loved the Pork Chop! Delicious maple flavor. The real highlight was our server, Evin. He was very attentive and friendly! Also very knowledgeable and great with suggestions! Angelica at the bar was also great! Would come back for the great staff and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Came into town for business and this place was across from my hotel. For being a chain, the food was amazing and the beer on tap selection was incredible. Would absolutely recommend."}
{"text":"I only popped in here for some quick beers and they were closing soon so I didn't stay long.   Solid beer selection, prices were a little higher than other places. The bartender was very helpful with suggesting other places that were open later."}
{"text":"I first saw all the big screens one day driving bye prior to them opening. It looked impressive from the outside. I wanted to grab a bite to eat and didn't know what I wanted so we came here. Walked in and was impressed at first by how many tables there were inside in a downtown restaurant setting. It was nice and big and TVs everywhere. We were sat quickly and our waiter was friendly. We ordered Caesar salads when had a nice presentation when they came out. By the time we finished those our food was coming out. Great timing. They have an extensive drink menus as well with several beer selections. We ordered the fish and Chips and the Carolina chicken sandwich which were both very good. We have nothing to complain about with this place. Can't wait to visit again to try the ribs."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday evening.   Not really busy, but not deadsville either.     Staff was very friendly and helpful.    I had the BBQ chicken flatbread and was pleased.   The other half had the tuna salad and was heard praising how awesome it was numerous times.

Oh, and 90 beers on tap?    We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Have visited City Works several times. Love the bar atmosphere and numerous beers on tap! Fun place to catch a football game with all the big screen TVs. In my experience, the service is not always the fastest or friendliest, but I thoroughly enjoy their bar menu and all of their appetizers are delicious- we really enjoy the pretzel bites & buffalo shrimp."}
{"text":"I have been to City Works several times and have had excellent service, beer and food each time. The beer list is simply amazing with at least 20% of the beers from local breweries. 

This is a great place to watch sports as there are giant TVs above the bar and the bar area is huge. Above the bar area is a huge skylight which is beautiful during the day. I'll have to visit at night. The PPG Castle should be visible, I think.

The place has been well staffed with friendly bar tenders, wait staff and even bussers!  Even when the place is quite busy, my service has been stellar. 

I have had primarily appetizers here and they have all been delicious!

I highly recommend this spot right in Market Square."}
{"text":"great for game and happy hour! lots of TV's, lousy food so eat before you go!"}
{"text":"My bacon cheeseburger was good, but 2 of my coworkers for the ribs and they were way over cooked, so much that the butter knife would barely cut through them. The others like the fish and chips."}
{"text":"I have to be honest- I went here last night and as soon as I walked in it was packed and the ambiance was great. It was high energy and looked like a great sports bar. I was so excited to try this place for the first time as it's in my favorite area of town, market square.  I found my friends and realized they had wine on tap- love it.  I ordered a Cabernet and couldn't wait to catch up with friends. When the waitress brought over my Cabernet, I took a sip and it was cold....yes, the RED Cabernet was COLD. I asked the server why it was cold and she said because it's on tap. WHAT?! That makes no sense. I'm a wine snob and have had wine on tap in numerous cities around the country and NEVER have I EVER had cold red Cabernet before. You can change the temperature on the tap settings. Most red wine should be room temperature. It changed the taste of the wine completely.  The food was mediocre. I got the Duck Ruben and had to switch it for the chicken Caesar salad which was much better.  Other than that, the service was great. Couldn't complain about our server because she was very accommodating and very nice. Hope this place makes some little changes cause I think it could be a hot spot since it's in the perfect area."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink on a Friday night after I noticed that this place was new to market square. The wall behind the bar was lined with flat screens. They also have a huge selection of beers. A girl walking in with me said 90 but I wasn't going to count them. They also have flights or you can make your own. There's a extensive menu for cocktails and wines also. 

I could see this place being a popular spot when the steelers play. I'd definitely come back to try the food next time."}
{"text":"What a great place - awesome service, great beer selection.  Happy hour giant pretzel is amazing.  Great looking inside and tons of tv's.  service was on point both times I was there.  Quick for lunch and then happy hour."}
{"text":"Horrible Service, went on a Friday for happy hour.  Waited for a waitress, plenty standing around talking.  Had a couple just stare at us wondering if they should take the table or not.  Finally had one come up to the table and she said she wasn't sure if it was her table or not and it was confusing because there was a shift change, even though I saw her talking to the table next to us and pointing at us 15 mins earlier.  I was excited to try this place even after another co worker told me when he went he sat and waited for a half hour and no one ever came to his table.  When he walked out, the hostess shrugged her shoulders and said \"sorry\" I guess telling the waitress \"you have a table\" was too difficult.  I guess everyone that was hired there, it's there first job in the service industry?  Not sure, but the manager should really read all the reviews on here."}
{"text":"A peculiar eating experience that would yield two stars instead of three if my salmon hadn't been cooked exactly the way I like it (medium-rare). Service was average. Neither good nor bad. The weird part was the presentation of my order. The food runner brought out a wooden plank with salmon, cipollini onion quarters, tomatoes, potatoes, and asparagus. Sounds fine, right? And that salmon was cooked perfectly. So what's not to love?

For whatever reason, the wooden plank was absolutely dripping in this white, watery stuff, and there was so much of it, it was dripping on the floor, and maybe even on the guy who brought it out. I had to use paper napkins to dry off the platter and the table so this white watery stuff didn't get on my shirt or pants. Not what you go out to eat for.

I've never had such an experience before.

Use a plate, City Works. Please."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food portion was average, service was good.  Would recommend for dinner / drinks."}
{"text":"We were seated promptly, but after 15 minutes still had not even had a waiter come get a drink order. Half the tables were open, so it wasn't like it was crazy busy. Even with a free burger coupon (and the burgers seemed over priced) , it's not worth the hassle. You have much better options like diamond market, emporio, tako, and soon brgr all close by."}
{"text":"My friend and I went there for some drinks on the patio and thoroughly enjoyed it. The staff there was pleasant and the drinks were delicious."}
{"text":"We popped in after a bike ride and to escape from the rain. Really lovely and comfortable seating inside and was super impressed with the appetizers we got. We got the fried cheese curds and fried pickles. Was surprised at how much I liked the fried pickles as the breading was unique to what I had but it made it lighter and less greasy. The red coulis that came with the curds was amazing as well. Our friends got wraps which looked like a great choice. Next time I would have gotten a wrap and the Hazedelic Beer but it had run out. Great place to eat and watch the game!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late lunch early dinner today after all the festivities downtown.   I had been here before but this time we were actually seated.  Like before there were empty tables but still a wait.  Not sure what their system is.  Lots of great tvs to watch a game and plenty to drink.  We ordered a ruby's red and a margarita...both were delicious and refreshing.  We also odered from the Shareable section...smoked wings with 2 fantastic dipping sauces and a BBQ chicken flatbread...so good!  It was a bit of a splurge as 2 drinks and 2 appetizers came to almost $50 but very good quality food and drink."}
{"text":"It was my first there. The service was great and the food was delicious! Only wish I had a bigger stomach!"}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh visiting my cousin and going to the Pirates game, so our big group came to City Works to drink and eat before. We were not disappointed! The beer list alone is a great reason to stop here as they have over 70 beers on tap. The buffalo chicken dip and crab dip were outstanding as were the cheese curds. I had a wedge which was good, your standard wedge salad. Other people said that the burgers they had were amazing as was the fried chicken sandwich. Service was above and beyond great as well. The only complaint is that we asked to keep three separate checks in our big group and the waitress didn't accommodate that. It created a bit of mayhem (mostly because some in our party are cheapskates). Otherwise, great meal and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Excellent wait staff with a big variety of beers to choose from. Came her for a lunch with a friend.  Started with fire cracker chicken rolls. It was a little too spicy the avocado sauce did cool it down. Also the plate came out greasy.
 I had the southern fried chicken sandwich, with side salad with the ginger and seaseme dressing. Side salad was a small, the dressing made that salad good. It was decent, kind of nothing special. I could get that sanwhich anywhere. Like a chick fil a .

The beer selection is the only thing that stands out."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I visited City Works on a Saturday night around 7:30. We were sat right away and the first thing we noticed and commented on was how it was the strangest mix of guests in a restaurant. We were seated next to a family with babies and children, a separate group of four 30-something year old women, and also noticed couples of all ages. The penguins were playing so they had that in all of the TVs. The dress was casual for most and the atmosphere seemed a little more upscale sports-bar-y. 

We ordered a flight of beers bc we didn't know what we really wanted to drink and then after the flight ended up both getting separate beers not from the flight. I wish I would have just ordered the banana wheat beer first bc I much preferred it over any of the flight options. 

We got an appetizer of buffalo chicken dip and then my fiancé got a burger and I got the fried chicken sandwich that was recommended by both the server and the menu itself. (Designated by a little \"CW\" symbol next to it.) my fiancé liked his burger and I really liked the sandwich. Nothing to write home about but definitely good. 

We ended up taking half of everything but the chicken dip home and our bill was around $75. 

Overall, I'm glad we checked this place out bc it has a unique and cool look to it and the service was good but I'm not sure I would seek it out specifically for another night."}
{"text":"This spot is a great place to schedule a meet up with friends, which is exactly what I did. Nice drink selection and they have plenty of space. We stayed a while and we weren't rushed whatsoever. Parking of course is not that great because it's in downtown. Worth the visit if you want a laid back in house extensive food and drink selection. Service was wonderful as well."}
{"text":"It's nice to have a new addition to Market Square since most of the establishments there have been in place for quite some time. That being said, I think City Works offers something a little different, always a plus, but is clearly still needing to work out some kinks. My parents, brother, fiance, and I arrived a little after 12:15 on Memorial Day. The patio was entirely filled since it was such a nice day. Also, we were told they have no patio tables that fit more than 4 people. If that's true, I think that's quite a detriment since Diamond Market across the square can fit large parties on their patio. We were  sat closer to the open windows which was a nice mix of both indoor and outdoor dining. Our server was a bit slow to greet us, and when she did she said she had a party before us and would be back shortly. About 5 minutes later she came back, explained the menu a bit, and brought us all waters. After the waters were brought, she didn't come back over for over 10 minutes. In fact, I noticed at least 2 tables walk out since she had yet to wait on them. Clearly, from watching her, she was responsible for far too many tables and was very overwhelmed. We ordered all of our drinks (iced tea, diet coke, a Kentucky Mule, and a Fire Over the Hill) plus our meals at the same time. About 5 minutes later, she brings the iced tea. Another 5 minutes pass and out comes the mule. At this time we ask for the diet soda and the beer, which admittedly, she forgot. At that time she said they didn't have the Fire on the Hill so I went with Flower Power. About 5 minutes later, the missing drinks appeared.

Our food took about an hour to be delivered to the table. The food runner told us several staff called off that day so they were having a lot of issues. Our food orders came out correctly for the most part. What was ordered:
1. Grilled chicken sandwich:grilled chicken breast, applewood smoked bacon, french fry aioli, shredded iceberg, vine-ripened tomato, red onion, avocado jalapeño sauce, kaiser roll. It was ordered and served with no tomato or onion. My brother said it was pretty good, and he also liked the seasoned fries it came with. 

2. Pulled pork sandwich: hand-pulled house smoked pork shoulder, housemade BBQ sauce, cider mustard, coriander coleslaw, kaiser roll. My mom really enjoyed the flavor of the pork. I had the chance to try it and it was very, very smoky! The pork was tender enough, and the housemade BBQ sauce added a nice kick. She chose a side salad as her side and it was nicely prepared with tomatoes, cucumbers, carrots, and onions.

3. Shrimp tacos: crispy shrimp, Asian slaw, ginger sesame vinaigrette, black sesame seeds, Sriracha, chili aioli, white corn tortillas. My fiance really enjoyed the flavors and found them to combine for a nice spice. Three come to a portion and he was filled afterwards. Salsa was supposed to come with the tacos but was not on the plate. He was able to tell a hostess who kindly brought out the missing salsa.

4. Smokehouse burger: house smoked BBQ pulled pork shoulder, smoked mozzarella, BBQ bacon onion relish, crispy buttermilk onion strings, toasted Hawaiian bun. My dad said this was a 5 star burger! It was huge on his plate and came with a side Caesar salad. 

5. Filet Mignon Sliders: two grilled filet medallions, caramelized onions, horseradish cream, pretzel roll. I asked our server what she preferred between the pulled pork and the sliders and she emphatically said she loves the sliders. She did not steer me wrong as these were delicious, and the portion size was filling enough for lunch but did not leave me overstuffed. They came out prepared perfectly medium rare as requested. I loved the horseradish sauce (I should have asked for more on the side), and the onions added a sweet contrast. The pretzel rolls seemed freshly baked and were sturdy enough to hold the medallions. The side salad was good and I really liked the white balsamic vinaigrette. 

Our server was good about refilling waters and soft drinks, and also checked on us a few times after our food was delivered. There are lots of TVs so I'm sure the space gets packed during sporting events! I also like the fact they have 90 beers on tap and many of them are local to Pittsburgh! Besides the long wait for the food, the other negative was that we were charged for the beer never received in addition to the Flower Power. My dad should have checked the bill closer so he could have had that corrected at the table. Overall, the meal was enjoyable, once received, and the prices are incredibly reasonable (all of our meals were between $12-15!). If they can work out the service kinks, I think City Works will be a solid place  to visit in the future!"}
{"text":"I'd say this place is mediocre.  Chopped salad.. eh, it was ok.  BF enjoyed his filet sliders.  Fried pickles were amazing - served fresh out of the fryer.    Wasn't wowed, but wouldn't oppose to going back if meeting a group of friends out."}
{"text":"Awful experience both times I've been there. Overcrowded, horrible service. Unless you enjoy waiting twenty minutes to get a beer, go to one of the other bars in market square."}
{"text":"This review is based strictly on atmosphere & beverages. Unfortunately, we were unable to eat while we were here but I wished we could have! The menu looked delicious & diverse.

The atmosphere is very modern, clean  and a large open space. It would be ideal for a happy hour with a group of friends! As soon as we walked in I was like \"wow!\".
They have a HUGE selection of beers. Literally something for everyone. It was hard to decide which to try with so many options, I wish I could have tried one of everything!

Our server was super friendly and easy to chat with. My only reason for 4 stars rather than 5 is because I have never been to City Works. So when I went to the bar when I first got there I asked the bartender \"what IPAs do you have?\" (At this point I was unaware they had so many choices). Instead of nicely saying that, the bartender worked rolled his eyes and pretty much threw the beer menu at me. Not very welcoming :) other than that it was a great experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Downtown for the Three Rivers Arts Festival and we were looking for a place to eat. Surprised to see Poros on Market Square is closed, but we decided to try the sports bar, City Works, nearby. I'm pretty easy to please so my filet mignon sliders were fine, although they seemed more medium than medium-well...but still tasty. Only complaints are one slider seemed to be thin on the horseradish cream, and the fry portion is anything but generous.

Unfortunately the better half's shrimp salad was a disappointment to her. The shrimp were fine, large and tasty, but the bed of kale was a bit chewy and didn't seem to go with the rest of the salad. 

I'd say I'm between a 3 and 4 stars on this but drinks were good and service was fine, so I'll go 4 stars."}
{"text":"Guys, I am so torn. The location is perfect, the vibe is just right, the presentation is great. You know what isn't as awesome? The food. Mediocre at best, Id say. I've had the salads and a few the the appetizers. For instance the chicken is bland, the fried pickles aren't battered and breaded before frying, the cheese for the pretzel bites is watery. 
The draft selection is vast but I am not a beer drinker so it does not appeal to me. The drinks are pretty good but I wouldn't order anything twice. Hoping the potential only soars from here and the food is more thoughtfully crafted."}
{"text":"Timing is everything.  Stopped in on a Sunday a couple weeks ago and had a great meal.  Stopped in on Good Friday before theatre.  Was not allowed to make reservations because of happy hour.  We took our chances.  BIG MISTAKE!  Pens fans, Fun Home and Stomp in town.  Even though there we empty tables, we could not be seated.  I saw the server we had out last visit and was told their kitchen was backed up.  Guess this place is too new to plan ahead or call staff in.  After standing in the bar area for over 30 minutes we left and went to Pizuvio down on Forbes. We were in and out in 30 minutes. They have great pizza and salad. Not the beer selection but quick and good.   Hope CityWorks get their act together and perhaps accept reservations at least in the restaurant side for those of us going the the cultural events and not sporting events.  We want in/Out in 60-90 minutes"}
{"text":"I liked City Works. 

Whenever I go to a restaurant I judge it, basically, on 3 things. 

1. Food: 3 stars. I got one of the \"house favorite\" items, the smokehouse. It was decent, but it didn't blow me away. I don't think I'll ever stand in the center of Market Square and say, \"I'm really craving some City Works food right now...\" The smokehouse was a creative menu item, and it sounded good. It was good...it just was average. Portion was also meh (but I like to eat a lot). Price point is what you would expect for downtown with my burger being $16. No doubt overpriced, but I was willing to shell out a little extra (well, I had no choice anyway) because the atmosphere was incredible. 

2. Atmosphere: screaming, screaming 5 stars. Honestly, I love the look and feel of this place. It would be a great place to meet up with friends in the city, and it's conducive for that. Seems like you can hang around in there for a while, if you'd like. The design is open and open to the outside too with various doors and skylights. You can appreciate the city while being in a very updated space. If you like watching sports... there are TVs everywhere. Trying to think of a way to clear it all out and just live in there...

3. Service: 3 stars. Our waiter was nice. I liked him. But a huge annoyance to me is that end of the meal time when you're ready to pay and no one is around to bring you your check. My friends and I were contemplating just leaving. Maybe I'm being selfish. Maybe this was this guy's first night, and maybe he was struck with the nerves and found himself stuck on the pot. Who knows. All I know, is we were trapped. We did get out eventually, though (don't worry). And we did see the waiter (so he made it through his deal too). 

*Notable 1 star, crappy moment (no pun intended): The table next to us...screamed in my ear for the entire duration of my City experience. This is not the restaurant's fault, and I don't hold it against them. But let this be a reminder to all of us to never be THAT table. No one likes that table. 

If you can do simple math, I'll save you the calculator time that I endured, my restaurant experience was an averaged 3 star experience. BUT if you go to just socialize and meet with friends, you're sure to have the 5 star experience. Give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food!  Great atmosphere! My favorite menu item is the chicken sandwich and I love the deserts!"}
{"text":"Best burger ever. Cityworks burger beat them all. It was short rib meat made into a patty. So delicious. Our table was by the sidewalk which offered great people-watching and the service was excellent. I'll remember that burger for a long time."}
{"text":"Visited from California. Was highly recommended. Saturday evening but not overly packed. Waited 15 minutes for a table which was good. After ordering, waited over an hour for food. Friend's sandwich bread was hard. My ribs were perfect. Ordered asparagus in place of cole slaw. Recieved 6 tiny asparagus (very tasty but cold). Fries were cold. Later found an increase of $4 on bill without a description. Was told was aspagus. I explained that wasn't an extra item but a switch and that a price increase was never mentioned. Was told it was an expensive green veggie. Had to ask fur manager to remove. Server was upset & non-communicative after that. Left a small tip with explanation of dissatisfaction."}
{"text":"I'm glad for a new option in Market Square.  According to our host, they've been open about 2 1/2 months now.

The inside is graced with tvs everywhere -- a good spot to watch sports.  

We opted to sit outside facing Market Square -- good for people watching.

I ordered the fish tacos; my husband ordered the duck Reuben sandwich.  He said the Reuben was lacking in the sauerkraut department, kinda the reason you order this sandwich.  My tacos?  Meh.  They were ok but I'm pretty picky about fish tacos.  Guess I didn't read (again).  They come with fried fish which I would rather they weren't.  There were 3 of them and they definitely didn't skimp on portions of fish.  They tasted ok (for fried fish) but not enough sauce or cabbage.  It also came with chips and salsa -- green not red.  All in all, it was ok, but not my fav fish tacos by a long shot.

I'd come back but order something else, as would my husband.

Oh, and all the beers are on tap, per our server, no bottles. My husband was happy about that."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and ambiance to watch sports. The beer selection is so extensive it was a bit overwhelming to choose! I got a basic salad because we ordered a bunch of apps. The eggs rolls are very spicy but good. My favorite was the BBQ chicken flatbread. Service was slow and inattentive. This place is best with big groups."}
{"text":"This is where I wish we could put .5 stars because I would give this a 3.5.  I decided to round up because the service was a 4 and location was a 4. The food was unfortunately a 3...

My family and I were trying this restaurant out to see if we wanted to host our family reunion luncheon event here. The location is great in the middle of market square and there are other activities after we would be eating close by. So, the location is perfect for our reunion. They have outdoor seating for the summertime on the patio. The only thing is, unless you want to do a buyout it's not ideal for a large group of 30 plus we are expecting for a private space.

The service was great and our waiter was very attentive. He made suggestions and was personable so this was a plus as well. 

The food however was not a 4. The food isn't bad but it isn't great either. It's just OK. They have a lot of different options like the duck Ruben and the southern fried chicken sandwich. But the taste wasn't there for me. I had the chicken sandwich with the pickles and the sauce. I have had similar sandwiches from living in Florida and the flavor wasn't even close to that. I tasted my mothers duck Ruben it's was okay but not very flavorful. Seems like they were missing something. My aunt said the same for her city burger that she got. No flavor. The fries were the frozen type, so if I eat here again I will swap sides."}
{"text":"The bar service was wonderful, however when we got to our table it wasn't quite the same. As I've been reading the food seems pretty good, which we were excited for, but we never received ours. When we talked to our server he didn't even realize or care that he had forgotten our order. A few of the drinks were not delivered correctly either. My friends and I would love to come back and give this place another try, but the service and attitude we received definitely left us with a sour feeling."}
{"text":"The good things to start with. One of the few places still open after 9pm on a Sunday. The patio is great - as well as the location right in the Market Square. The beer selection is great too. Service was ok nothing special. One of the guest went in with a dog - and a waitress was touching the dog every-time passing by - but I haven't seen her washing or disinfecting her hands. 
To start with we ordered the Mac&Cheese with black truffles to share. It was ok but it had not really a truffle taste (not even from a truffle oil) and I could not find any black truffles. I had a fish taco - this was ok and quite big. My wife ordered the mushrooms risotto - which was really catastrophic (sorry) - but you couldn't eat the stuff it was sooooooooo salty - I think the whole salt dispenser got into that risotto by accident. We let the server know - with no immediate reaction. But surprisingly he had taken the risotto off the check. So location 3 stars food not more than 2 stars - I'm ending up giving 3 stars because the server took the risotto off the check without saying."}
{"text":"Great ambience and beer list, but mediocre food. I got the chicken sandwich with fries and the meal was very salty. Food is definitely an improvement area!"}
{"text":"You cannot get a drink at this place! I was excited that the weather finally broke and was looking forward to sit outside here. We got a booth outside, the server came over right away and took our drink order, 20 minutes later and we still did not have our drinks so we left! This is a cool spot but I don't think I'll give it another chance."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. The service was the worst I've had in years. The server was literally organizing her checks on my table and spinning around in circles right next to me. The food was okay but nothing special. I'll come back for beers. Nothing else."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Annapolis and chose to come here for dinner. We were not disappointed. Jill was or waitress and even though the place was packed we received great customer service. I had the fish and chips and my husband had the fish tacos. Both dishes were great. 

Would be a great place to come with a group of people to watch a game, drink and have some tasty food."}
{"text":"Fun ambiance and great service. However I had one of their burgers with fries. The burgers are not only frozen but probably come with fake grill marks. It tasted as though it was just heated and then placed on a bun. Makes little sense considering how much they've invested in the location, decor, and service. They need to transition to real burgers (hand-formed) and actually grill the raw meat. Aside from the burgers I would go back."}
{"text":"Great location if you're trying to watch a game with friends.  Their beer list is extensive and they offer well priced flights as well as make your own flights.   I'll add that the samples you get with each flight are bigger than other breweries I've visited which is nice.   As a beer/ sports fan this place is a 5/5 given the location and selection of drinks.  

As a foodie this place is a 3/5. As most people have said the food is good but nothing to write home about.  That being said the vibe of this place isn't the sit down restaurant you take your parents to. So again if your going for a good time with friends for a game, highly recommended, going for a nice dinner out....maybe not the best choice."}
{"text":"I've eaten at City Works twice for lunch during the week, and had great experiences both times. The first was with a large group, and the staff were friendly and helpful with accommodating us. We had our own little room! Each time, the food was delicious. I had the mac and cheese with chicken and bacon the first time, and the salmon the second. The mac and cheese was a huge portion, so I was hoping the pricier salmon would include enough for leftovers, but it did not. It was a delicious and healthy lunch portion. This is a great place for a large group during the day!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite for happy hours or relaxed drinks in a nice place where the atmosphere is relaxed and you can still talk with lots of tv's and music that isn't to loud. Their beer list is big and you can ask for samples."}
{"text":"Break down of my experience here: 
90+ beers on tap! 
Huge televisions! 
Ridiculously good and strangely enough evenly \"topping-ed\" duck nachos!! 
Superb location in the middle of Market Square.

This place was absolutely great! I have found my new go-to bar for sporting events and a delicious meal with great beer! Good thing they have a rewards program too, bc I am already a frequent flier and it has only been open for 1 month!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, great spot in Market Square. I had lunch there for the first time this past Sunday. I liked the outside seating option and the cheese curds were delicious! Drinks were very good all around-basil lemonade, cranberry mojito and a London mule were the picks at our table. My burger was cooked perfectly and the side salad with house dressing was delicious. The only thing that would've upped my score was providing valet parking on the weekends and not just The weekdays. All in all a great place to dine and drink!"}
{"text":"It's almost there.  That's what I felt when I recently visited this restaurant.  The décor is right, the atmosphere is right and the location is right.  Just a few more tweaks to their food and the restaurant will be all the way there.

I just recently went to lunch at City Works with my usual lunch suspects and we ordered a boatload of food.  I ordered the Carolina Fried Chicken which was buttermilk breaded with house-made spicy bread and butter pickles, mustard BBQ sauce and iceberg lettuce served on a brioche bun for $13.00.  The dudes ordered the Duck Reuben with sliced duck leg, citrus tarragon apple sauerkraut, Gruyere and Russian dressing served on marble rye for $14.00.  All three of us had the Olive Oil Parsley Fries.  Therein lied one of the problems.  I'm a stickler for fresh cut fries.  Why spend all of that time developing interesting and tasty sandwiches (or \"Handhelds\", as they are called at the restaurant) only to serve them with frozen fries?  And the fries were served only a little above room temperature.  That's one of my personal pet peeves...frozen fries!  Yech!

It was lunch time and I know that time can be incredibly busy, but our server took our order, disappeared until our food was ready, delivered our food and had to be waved down for additional fixings.  No follow-up!  Too busy!  We had to do another wave down for our check.  Again, I know that you're busy during lunch time, but dang!  Can we at least have them ask us one time if we needed anything?  Geez!

So, that's why I said that they are almost there.  It's the attention that is paid to little details that sets good restaurants apart from great restaurants.  Like I said, City Works has some good ideas with regards to so many things...I just them to refine their service and several menu items."}
{"text":"Great location and decor. Found the food to be very decent but not outstanding...a little over-priced for the quality. The craft beer selection is impressive but the marketing folks of this chain obviously don't want you to know the size of glass they use for each of the 60 or so beers on tap. There's plenty of room in the description of each beer to note the pour size. The ABVs are all noted plainly. Most bars with good craft selections plainly state the size of glass used for each. Go figure why City Works doesn't print it on their menu. $$$$$"}
{"text":"I finally made it to City Works to actually try the food. We settled on city works because we could not validate being inside on such a beautiful evening. 

Atmosphere and setting: City Works is a 5. It's a great place to sit outside and enjoy the great weather. It was 8 pm on a Thursday so there was a decent amount of people that had the same idea but it was not overly crowded.  As long as you are not in a rush, this is a great space to be on a nice day. 

Food and drinks: Our waiter recommended we try the veggie burger and man was he spot on. Their veggie burger does not taste like a veggie burger, it does not have the texture of a veggie burger. It was so good (once it actually came out from the kitchen). I understand why they trademarked this burger. Highly suggest trying this, even if you are not a vegetarian.  It is worth it and quite interesting. Also, there is a crazy amount of beers and wines on tap to choose from. However, we were \"those people\" that opted for markers manhattan's because it was just a liquor night over beer. 

Service: This is where City Works just drops the ball. Our waiter was so nice and enjoyable to speak with and we felt very welcomed in the beginning. However, we had to have waited at least 30 min+ for our food and I realize that is not his fault, but in that time we also finished our first round of Manhattans and as our drinks were getting low we were never asked if we wanted another round etc. When our food did come, we actually had to get up and go grab napkins and utensils from another table.  We also were waiting around for quite a while for our waiter to come back to give the bill. It seems this is a trend at City Works and that's kind of a bummer because the atmosphere and drinks are there. . . just get on top of a kitchen and staff's attentiveness and I think you will see an increase in the ratings."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my lunch.   The salad I got as a side was a bit small.  The burger looked like a pre made burger, but tasted good enough."}
{"text":"The restaurant was beautiful. Excellent waitress and the food was really good. They have an extensive amount of beers on tap."}
{"text":"When you first walk in, it seems to be AWESOME! The beer selection has a nice variety and flavors for everyone. The food doesn't look very appetizing, that's why I have never tried it. The service is pretty flakey and I'm really just not impressed with this place at all."}
{"text":"Honestly, I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars but if I have to pick between a 3 and a 4 I will go with a 4. It's definitely a great spot to go for Happy Hour, you can get some cheaper drinks and order a few cheap appetizers and be totally happy! And I will say it is one of the few places downtown, particularly in the Market Square area that is accommodating for a large group for Happy Hour. I also went during the Friday of restaurant week however and I was a bit disappointed. We made reservations a week in advance specifically because we wanted to try out their Restaurant Week menu and when we arrived they told us they were already all out of everything. It is hard not to be a bit upset that they ran out with 3 days left of Restaurant Week. We ended up getting the Firecracker Rolls and Buffalo Chicken Dip appetizers. I then ordered the Fish and Chips for dinner. Everything was good - but not amazing. A solid place for dinner if you're looking for a fun environment, drinks, and decent American style food."}
{"text":"Decent food and lots of happy hour space! Although the food is just OK and the happy hour specials aren't out of this world, my coworkers and I like this spot for after work because it's huge and can accommodate big groups. Typically they have a handful of craft beers for $5 during happy hour, and wines on special as well. This is a good spot to catch any game that's on - always a full crowd!"}
{"text":"It took them 15 minutes to get me a simple soda! Another hour for my burger. Needless to say they didn't even recognized us at the table until another 15 minutes have passed by. Service it's horrendous and wait times for drinks and or foods it's even worse! What a horrible first impression this place leaves you with!"}
{"text":"The service was good at the start of the visit, but after we ordered our first round of drinks she was missing for a very long while. Our drinks were empty for at least 15 minutes and It wasn't crazy busy. We were trying to get to the penguins game earlier but ended up being late. The mushroom flatbread is to DIE for and the drinks are strong, their specialty cocktails are a little pricey but I get why. Interested in giving them another shot though, my friend left her credit card on accident but they kept It in a safe for her which we appreciated."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday night during the Final Four. Needless to say it was packed. Didn't have reservations so we waited about 90 minutes for a table. We were able to get drinks and stand away from the bar. As big as the bar is it was 4 or 5 people deep. For as busy and new as it is the service was excellent. Food came promptly. The ribs are outstanding. Probably some of the best that I've had. Had to wait for drinks a couple of times but overall we were impressed with how well the place operated. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped at City Works for an early dinner over Memorial Day Weekend. This is a great new addition to Market Square!

Atmosphere: This may be the largest restaurant in downtown Pittsburgh. Plenty of seating indoor and outdoor. There are several very large TVs inside for sports enthusiasts. The outdoor seating, however, is much better for people watching.

Food: The food was incredible! Definitely 5 star worthy. (I'm not a snob that only gives 5 stars to high end or gourmet restaurants.) for what City Works is, a bar/restaurant, the food was perfection. Do yourself a favor and get the Firecracker Roll! There's a perfect amount of spice in this Asian inspired chicken egg roll, and the avocado sauce was sooo good. The only thing that would make this better is more avocado sauce. For the main course I had Fish Tacos. The mahi mahi was cooked to perfection! Crispy outside with a light, flakey inside. The sauces on here were creamy and delicious. The salsa with the chips was also very tasty. I can't wait to try more food from here!

Service: The only minor downfall was the service. Our waitress walked by us several times without asking if we needed anything else. All I wanted was a beer! 

All in all, this place is excellent! I highly recommend City Works to local Pittsburghers. For tourists, there's plenty of other more unique food options in this city. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Wonder around looking for a place to eat. First two places we stopped Hannover an hour wait on a Tuesday evening, no thanks.  Walked in here to immediate seating.  Place was pretty full on a hockey night.  Host and hostess were very friendly and promptly seated us. Our food was out quick too. Wife had wedge salad and I had a bowl of clam chowder.  We split fish tacos.  The wife reports the salad was very good. My chowder was loaded with clams and was also very good. We would both order respective things again.  The fish tacos were good I especially like the pico, and would order it again.  Pico was a little bit for the wife and she would not order it again.   Our waitress Ester Le was great. Knowledgeable on the menu great personality and attentive to our table on a busy night.  Our drinks never went empty.  She is a very good waitress.   Deserts may bring us back as they sounded great.  They have a big beer selection but neither of us drinks beer.  Worth a visit"}
{"text":"This is the second time I ate here. I won't count the first one as it was opening weekend and places usually need time to figure things out. 
However this time was not much better. The staff was nice enough however the food leaves much to be desired. I ordered the Grilled Chicken sandwich. With my first bite I realized it was cold. I asked the server if it was supposed to be cold and she said no. It wasn't warm at all. I opened the sandwich and it is clear that the chicken is not actually grilled, but was precooked and just thrown on the grill to get some dirty grill marks. I will post the pic if I can. Anyone who has ever grilled a piece of chicken knows what it should look like. The server offered to have the kitchen prepare a new sandwich for me but I did not have time to wait because I had to get back to work. Fortunately they took it off if the bill, but still...
I did not try my girlfriend's burger, but she was not impressed with it. 
Overall a disappointing meal with overpriced drinks. It's sad that this is what is happening all over Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Two hours to get our food.  I realize we were there after a Steelers game but really this was too much.  Our waitress did her best but I would not recommend."}
{"text":"I had seen this place a few times in Market Square and finally got the chance to stop. I got the Chicago Punch and summer storm. The drinks are strong and very good, presentation is beautiful as well. My friend got an order of fried pickles and said they weren't very good and the music is loud if you are just trying to get a nice dinner. Our server was awesome though! So friendly and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Came in for some beers and snacks at happy hour and are looking forward to going back. 

The draft list is impressive to say the least. 90 beers on tap with a large percentage of local and PA drafts. (East End, Church, Drai Laag, Grist House, etc) with every style pretty well represented. 

We had the cheese curds (happy hour special) and the duck confit nachos. Both were excellent with generous portions. The nachos were on fried wontons which was a unique presentation that worked very well. 

The restaurant was not busy while we were there but the service was incredible. The host was attentive and sat us quickly, our server was friendly and knowledgeable, and as soon as a plate or glass was empty the next employee to walk by asked if they could clear it. 

Cannot wait to go back and try more of the menu and the silly awesome beer list."}
{"text":"If you like the theme of tapped beer of great selection - this is a good stop. Location is at base of glass castle of PPG Headquarters. Menu selection for food was lacking selection depth - but food delivered was good. Service was on top of it as well."}
{"text":"Visited Pittsburgh last year (2017) and loved this place.  Tonight, 4/30/2018, the service and food were mediocre at best.  It doesn't take a lot to please me, but the dinner chopped chicken salad was a very small portion with tough chicken that was not fit to eat.  The staff had a better time socializing than working.  Sorry City Works, you lost me forever!  (Get new management ASAP!!  Hurry!!)"}
{"text":"This place is new, so give it time. Today for the Steeler game, the hostess kept giving long wait times with open tables EVERYWHERE. Finally, ready to leave to get food somewhere else, the hostess mentioned we could sit on the porch without a wait.  we waited 1 hour for hummas app (waitress said they delivered it to another table). When it came, it was cold hard old pitas, the beer select ion is great, but delivered to the table WARM!! WARM BEER?!?! How do you get that wrong? The filet sliders were cold and rubbery. The turkey burger (peppercorn) must have been bad because I wasn't even home before I got sick. What a terrible choice for the game. Bad move. Great space, they put a lot of money into the space.  just paying attention to the wrong key elementS for success."}
{"text":"I've come here a couple times for drinks and watch sports games. This place is definitely a sports bar. I can't speak to their food but they have an awesome selection of beer. Dozens of beers on tap. Dozens of TVs to watch on. My fiancé really wanted to watch the World Cup soccer game with sound and the hostess was very accommodating and allowed us to watch the game with the sound on in a separate room. I'll definitely continue coming here for drinks/games."}
{"text":"City Works is the definition of go big or go home. The bar/restaurant is HUGE - probably the most spacious of any bar I've been to downtown. The walls are lined with flat screens so you can catch all your games here while downing one of their 90 beers on tap. 

I stopped in for lunch one afternoon with a group of others. You could still smell the fresh wood! Our server greeted us quickly and was very friendly throughout the visit. I could not say that all the servers were having as good of a day because I heard multiple plates or glasses being dropped and shattered.The training squad has some work to do, I guess. 

We started our meal with some calamari and cheese curds for appetizers. Fried cheese really isn't my thing, so although I wasn't a fan, that's probably a purely an issue of preference.They offer multiple vegetarian options and it is clearly labeled on the menu. I tweaked the salad order a bit to make it vegetarian and add in the veggie patty as protein. It took a couple tries for our server to get it right, but they were very friendly and prompt when I had to send it back, so that was greatly appreciated. The salad was delicious! The veggie patty initially threw me off with its vibrant red color, however, it tastes a LOT better than it looks. Super crispy on the outside, but when you cut into it, there's that that soft bean texture in the center. It paired really well with the salad. The portion was also very hearty, so you will not leave hungry.

Everyone in my party was enjoying their food, until one person actually bit down on a plastic spear in his food. You know, one of those spears that should be going THROUGH your burger and not placed INSIDE of it. Don't people usually sue for this? Either way, it was pretty dangerous and definitely a choking hazard. I understand they're a new restaurant and working out some kinks, buuuut this should be unacceptable. Chew carefully, everyone!"}
{"text":"I was there lastnight/evening my friend got a jack and coke ($10) and after drinking it we noticed something odd in the glass we dumped it out and it was someone's fake FINGERNAIL!! We mentioned it to the bartender and she kinda laughed about it and offers free drink!! We also told the manager on duty and he said \"sorry there's nothing I can do\"  DRINKERS BEWARE  bottles only for me if I ever go back"}
{"text":"Glorified food court vibe. 
Expensive apps and shareables that are hardly for sharing with a group. Food was lackluster. Only 1 of the 4 of us at my table were pleased. Only saving grace is the extensive draft list, though overall value considered, you'd be much better off heading to a local brewery and getting food elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's well on its way of becoming one of the best sports watching bars in the city, with an abundance of large screen TVs mounted above the vast, copper-topped bar area and ~90 beers (and wine!) on tap. It's positioned nicely for a downtown happy hour with its bright, modern space that draws a diverse mix of working class folk. The 4-6PM window is go time for $4 apps + (select) taps. The cheese curds were hot 'n fresh, but the smoked tomato based dipping sauce was curious. The better dipping sauce is the IPA gouda cheese that accompanies the pretzel bites. Feelin' spicy? Then go with the firecracker rolls. The happy hour prices are what they should be charging all day err day, but their service game needs work -- you should never have to flag a server down, especially one that doesn't even work the area you're sitting in! We'll likely give it another whirl just because, but there's better quality food elsewhere for the same prices."}
{"text":"Had the duck rueben before and it was great. This time I ordered the duck nachos and I was amazed at the flavors! The duck actually tasted as though it was smoked. My buddy had the duck rueben and he was amazed. Service was great!"}
