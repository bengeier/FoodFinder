{"text":"A great little Italian eatery with some very good food.  Very small dining area around the back of the building (less than 10 tables I believe).  But they have recently expanded to include a patio for more dining in the warmer months.

Great daily specials to help you pick from the menu, and just the price / portion size to make Campola's a regular stop for me.  (Not too little, not too much, like some other Italian places)."}
{"text":"The food at Campola's is pretty good. They have a philly cheesesteak that is fantastic, but is not on the menu, so you need to ask for it. The pizza bones are good too, definitely a good appetizer. 

However, I was not happy with the service. They recently changed their website and their menu. When I called for takeout, they asked me if I wanted fries or chips with my sandwich. I assumed that the fries or chips were included, but when I arrived, they were an additional $2. It's not the $2 that is the issue. I didn't want them in the first place, so don't ask me which one I want, as if they are included. Poor form. Then, when I got there, it was a $12 minimum for credit card. Not many people carry cash anymore, which makes this an issue. However, the guy who gave me the bill understood and let me use the card. Campola's is one of the better food establishments in Mentor, but that is not saying much."}
{"text":"Good food and the waitress is fun. Very intimate setting. Order the pizza bones.

However, once the owner comes back, she's all about the get-the-people-out-and-get-new-people-in attitude.  It made our dinner feel rushed.  She even mentioned to the other table, \"We were trying to get them to leave\", while seating them.   We were still on dessert and were maybe there for an hour.We would go again, but we we go earlier instead of later to avoid"}
{"text":"The food is in fact pretty good but the service and staff attitude are dreadful. We want with a buy one meal get one free. It was very evident that using a coupon makes you a second rate customer. Intentionally smaller portions were given compared to the table next to us. We asked for a few more dinner rolls only to find out when the bill arrived they charged us for each extra one! When I pointed this out to her she rudely replied \"we can't give things away\". I have never been to an Italian restaurant where bread or rolls are not included. If in fact they need to charge....fine but she should have at least mentioned that prior to bringing them. My husband ordered spaghetti with oil instead of red sauce and she arbitrarily charged $2 more for that as well. Needless to say we will not be going back. Evidently that is why there was only one other table there as well."}
{"text":"I driven  past this restaurant dozens of times but I never stop by.
From the outside it was like this with somebody's house that was converted into a restaurant.
There looks to be a nice back patio to have something to drink in the dining room is little but not bad. However I'm not for sure exactly how good the food is. I had the eggplant Parm the other evening.

It was not good at all. I could tell that it wasn't the frozen breaded eggplant cutlets  for lot of restaurants use. 

You could tell this was hand cut lightly breaded not fried or baked very well. I think the reason why there was so much sauce and cheese on it was to the hide the fact that I wasn't prepared very well.
The pizza sauce that was on the eggplant and the spaghetti was very spicy and had a little bits of ground beef or sausage in it. It didn't taste very good and if I were them I would change my sauce recipe.

Needless to say I won't be dining at this establishment in the future very disappointed."}
{"text":"excellent service and staff. we sat outside in the patio had a few drinks and ordered food. my gf ordered a salad with chicken and I got ravioli. excellent food and the homemade sauce is the bomb! must try it if your in the area! great place to unwind after a hard days work. they have live music on the weekends most of the time. over all I would highly recommend this little kept secret in Mentor!.... since my first posting of this place we have been stopping here weekly to have drinks and also have had a few pizza's as well.. the food is excellent and Nikki will make sure you are completely happy with what ever you order. Great people at this place the owners are great people and the clientele is also very nice."}
{"text":"Fantastic little restaurant. Been there twice now, though others in my family are regulars. It has quickly become my favorite place to eat in Mentor. The wait staff is very friendly and accommodating. They even gave us some free desert and soup this time just because they like my mother so much. 

The first time I went I had the chicken parmesan, which was delicious (a staple and test of mine when trying new Italian places). This time I had the aglio olio and it was equally delicious. Others in my family tried some of their pizzas, which were also fantastic, and tonight my mother had the prime rib, which was one of their specials. In her words it was \"some of the best she'd had in a long time.\" Their appetizers and desserts are also extremely delicious. 

If you haven't tried this place yet you need to. Some of the best food in town and it's nice and local, not big box."}
{"text":"My daughter talked me into going here as she had been there before and loved it. I'm glad I listened to her. The food was amazing. Good dinner salad with delicious Italian dressing. I ordered the baked ziti and it was phenomenal. Totally stuffed but I couldn't stop eating. My girl ordered spaghetti and meatballs and she loved it. We saw the dessert tray being shown to another table and despite being super full ordered a triple chocolate cake. Also super delicious. We enjoyed the service. She was fast and very personable. We'll definitely be putting this on our regular rotation."}
{"text":"Bad enough to be thrown out of a restaurant -- but to be thrown out because the owner/chef screwed up both our entrees and threw a fit when we pointed it out? Wow.

We got there around 7 on a Tuesday. There was no one there. No one at all. As we walked in, we passed a board that listed about a half-dozen specials -- but with no descriptions, and the writing wasn't completely legible. At least, I don't think Chicken Przysmyszl is a thing. So when the waitress came to take our order, we asked her to list the specials.

She couldn't, apologizing that it was her first day ever as a waitress. Fair enough. She went away and came back to tell us the specials were tilapia and stuffed shells. Period. We asked for details. She had to go back and ask again. (Note: We don't blame her. Why wouldn't the owner prepare her?) All that brought was that the tilapia was pan-seared in garlic oil. Nothing about sides, nothing about the shells. The waitress was obviously getting no help at all.

My wife ordered the penne florentine; I ordered the \"ten breaded shrimp.\" Both came with salads, which were nothing special, and one roll each. Oddly, the rolls were slicked down with something wet but tasteless all over the soft crust.

The waitress came out to ask my wife if she wanted meatballs with her penne. No, she said, puzzled; she wanted the sausage listed on the menu.

Then the entrees come out. My wife's? A cup or so of penne and a splash of red sauce forming an atoll around an empty middle of the plate. Mine? Rice pilaf, fine; the \"mixed vegetables\" was broccoli and broccoli; and ... eight shrimp.

My wife asked about her sausage -- and for another look at the menu. Sure enough, penne florentine was supposed to be penne with Italian sausage, spinach, pine nuts and a garlic wine sauce -- nothing at all like what she got. And, yes, the menu clearly said \"Ten\" shrimp. The waitress went off to the kitchen.

Out comes the chef. He glares at my wife's plate -- she's eaten a couple of noodles while waiting -- and says \"Oh, so you decided to eat that.\" No, she says, she wants the penne florentine she ordered. Then he turns to me. It's supposed to be eight shrimp, he says. The menu says \"ten,\" I reply.

\"That's a typo,\" he says.

(Side note: Typo? \"Eghit\" is a typo for \"eight.\" \"Ten?\" Not.)

My wife, joking, says that's not a typo, that's bait-and-switch. (She was smiling when she said it. But, I must also point out, she was technically correct.)

The chef grabs both our plates off the table and starts shouting about how it's not bait and switch and we don't want to eat there. He keeps yelling that it's a typo. I say something like \"who are you to yell at us because you got our orders wrong?\"

\"I'm the owner,\" he says.

\"Not for long, at this rate,\" I say.

As we walk out, he's still yelling. \"We don't want you in here!\"

As it happens, the half a shrimp I got to eat before he ripped my plate away was tasty, and my wife says the tomato sauce that shouldn't have been on her plate was pleasantly spicy. But, no, I don't think we'll be going back."}
