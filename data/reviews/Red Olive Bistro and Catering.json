{"text":"Chef Nash (Avinash's) baklava is delicious. Every time when I go there to have his food I cant leave without baklava. This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place. They have good food and good service. The man at the till is super sweet but I have to warn you DO NOT. EVER. go to this place if you are in a hurry. They have got no hustle whatsoever. None. By the time you line up, pay, have a 10 min conversation about god knows what at the till (they are really nice), figure out the till, count your change etc. it could very well take you over 20 mins to walk out the door with a sandwich. Gotta work on your hustle, Red Olive. I have had some success calling ahead to let them know I will be coming so they have my order ready but then the till process is still pretty time consuming."}

{"text":"Used a Groupon to try this place out for lunch.  Diverse menu (possibly too diverse?), tried the special beef stroganoff which was good and meaty.  Portion was a little smaller than I would've liked, but I have a large appetite.  Owner came by to check on everything and dropped off some free dessert for us to try.   Overall, food was solid.  Will have to return to try the flatbreads/wraps which seem like better values."}
{"text":"This little bistro is right near my office, so we decided to give it a try the other day.  I got the fish wrap with apple slaw, and it was really good - the portion was huge, i couldn't finish it. My coworker got the shrimp butter chicken and said it was great.  We saw a sign on the wall that said they have Arepas, (little Venezuelan sandwich things) so we will definitely go back for those. Service was off the hook - the man working was so nice, and he brought us over two little slices of carrot cake (so good!) to snack on while we waited. The food took a little longer than most cafes, but was well worth the wait."}
