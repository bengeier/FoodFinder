{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever experienced!!!!! I don't even know where to begin...Ordered 2 pizzas which took probably over 20 minutes to do, least of my problems with this place.The Mediterrean pizza came and it was a super sloppy hot mess of total disgustingness! Called back asking for a refund and the girl apologized and said she couldn't give a refund but we could order another pizza...ok we did and it was passable and delivered faster than the first one. 

Now is when the absolutely horrendous custom service starts. My husband and I are in the process of moving to this town so I didn't get a chance to check my bank records for a few extra days when I do I'd been double charged for the pizzas. So I look up online and call....4x's before anyone answers. Online AND on their OWN answering machine it states their hours are 10:30... When I do finally get through I' m asked to call back AGAIN because the manager is out. 

the manager, KIM, is completely rude, unprofessional and unapologetic and basically is annoyed that it's been a whole week since I ordered the pizza but only 2 days since it went through my bank account. Her whole attitude was just horrendous and then she hung up on me as I was asking for the owners name. I called back and asked again for the owners name and was out on hold given back to speak with Kim who said she didn't need to listen to someone yelling at her, which I wasn't by any means yelling but yes I was upset because she acted like this was all my fault and I was bothering them....c.mon people there are a million other pizza shops around this style of service and down right unprofessional behavior is simply uncalled for. I actually tried calling back again because I would really like to speak tin the owner and HA they let the call go to voicemail.....

Thinking i' m going to have to just go up their in person and demand to speak with the owner. All I really wanted was an apology and my money back..... 

Would never...ever recommend this place not even to my worst enemy!"}
{"text":"I'd love to be able to review the food here, but sadly, I've never actually be able to order anything!  I've tried AT LEAST 3 times to call and place an order to pick up.  The first two times I got the answering machine repeatedly saying that they were assisting other customers or closed.  I just called again again today to try to order a pizza because I got a coupon in the mail....I was THRILLED when someone actually answered the phone, but she immediately put me on hold...for SIX MINUTES!!!  Ridiculous.  So I hung up and tried calling back right away--I GOT THE ANSWERING MACHINE AGAIN!  I tried over and over, probably 7 times and got the machine each time.  So I called the pizza place that's just across the plaza and ALWAYS answers their phone.

Absolutely pathetic service...they should be ashamed."}
{"text":"Great pizza!! Cheese is so good. Sausage is the best. Perfect pizza everytime. I just got my reward card and plan on going here for pizza from now on. And I may check out barking bullfrog one weekend soon. Instead of just Sunday."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Cleveland. As of summer, 2014, kitchen is under new ownership. Everything is cooked with fresh ingredients, from lasagna to broasted chicken.  The place really took a step in the positive under the new cooks, formerly with the Park Tavern. 

If 10 minutes is too long to wait for your pizza, walk next door to the Barking Bullfrog for a drink!  

They also have NTN Buzztime trivia."}
{"text":"We found this place after a visit to Hinckley Lake. Super convenient. I was hesitant to go there after such few ordinary reviews but we were taken fully by surprise. We sat at the bar next door, where you can be served the pizza. An amazing variety of cheap beer. On a Sunday evening, it was $2-3. Being Vegetarians, we ordered the Veggie Supreme 11\". The smallest pizza size available. It was amazing. Huge quantity of toppings and just for $5. Amazing pizza, amazing cheese and amazing veggies for $5. We also ordered homemade chips and spinach and artichoke dip. So yumm. I've already bookmarked it for my next visit to Hinckley :)"}
