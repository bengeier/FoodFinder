{"text":"The bartenders are nice. Everyone is friendly.  A smaller bar but a whole lot of fun.  Karaoke all night. They also play some songs in between. Great place to go with friends."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my first visit to NoDa101 last night for karaoke and drinks for a friend's birthday.  I don't think I've ever been to a karaoke joint where a majority of the patrons had some serious talent...really entertaining and the stage area was inviting.  Christy behind the bar was attentive and super friendly!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service we went there on 1/17 and expected just to be acknowledged but they were too busy with others and didn't care . No acknowledgement and don't know the food wantity"}
{"text":"The bartender scoops the ice out of the bin with the glass she is making your drink in. No wonder my glass was chipped. Hopefully I didn't drink the shard of glass."}
{"text":"It's just gross here.  Not to mention my card gets declined every time I go here (plenty of money and no problems elsewhere)."}
{"text":"Get little joint to get a good drink!  Friendly staff and entertainment is like a box of chocolates."}
{"text":"I've been here three times now, brunette bartender was super nice so thats why the 2 stars. However, the karaoke dj shows favoritism loo which makes the list extra long. One guy went up like 4-5 times to my 2 and I was there since opening and the guy's name was never on the list. A regular, i'm ok with that. But if you're going to skip people for that reason, then dont be \"holier than thou\" and refuse a tip to move people up the list. you're still skipping people for someone's regular business (still money), we learned how to get in line in pre-k. Jokes on me I didnt get a gold star. Also he'll change the speed of your song and embarass people on the mic that may be a little drunk. Some of us are sober to drive for our drunk friends/family."}
{"text":"This place is like a 3.5 but I rounded up cuz I'm feeling nice. Came here on a Saturday night during our bar hop while I was in town. It was crowded and seems to be pop with the locals. They had karaoke and people seemed really into it. I don't care for that stuff but it can be fun watching drunk people yell loudly.   Well drinks were just 5 bucks and were super strong, so that was the best part obvz. They seem to have a good selection of beers as well. The atmosphere was kinda grimey... think King of the Hill meets Buckwild (different from the rest of the bars in NoDa). There are definitely some creeps here so watch your back, ladies.   The night I went, the girls' toilet in the bathroom would not flush. Barf. They also randomly charged my card a dollar like days after I had gone. It's not a big deal and it was one dollar but like... why.   Good bar service even though it was busy. The bartenders were fast and attentive and the guy who made our drinks was pretty cute too haha. I'll prob never find myself in NC again, but would definitely come back here if I did."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great hole-in-the-wall type bar, Noda 101 is one of a few in the local Noda area. Merely a room with a full bar occupying about 50% of the total available space of the building, it is very close-quartered and a great place to have a low-key hangout over a few drinks. A party of 5 is probably pushing your luck getting face time with everyone.  Although unfamiliar with the weekly drink specials and entertainment, I can tell you that on a Tuesday night you are likely to find all three- drafts on special, a PA system with radio-play, and intermittent live music by a local artist. They will usually set up their gear and play in the front corner of the bar. The volume is usually pretty average and you won't have a hard time hearing a conversation.  The crowd is pretty low key during the week, and may not be the case on a weekend. Bartenders are generally pretty friendly, and sometimes partake in conversing.  Overall, it's a pretty solid hangout joint."}
{"text":"Fun spot to stop in and grab a drink. Usually we hop in while waiting on places like Cabo or Haberdish. Overall the bar is chill, the drinks are cheap, and you are entertained (or take your turn entertaining) at karaoke. Don't forget to jump into the prop bucket to step up your karaoke game - or in my case, as a distraction from my lack of talent. Either way, always a fun time and easy stop in NODA."}
{"text":"Upon arriving to NoDa 101 tonight, we immediately were stared at and treated poorly by the bartender, who later told(yelled) at me that he was the manager. All night long, we received poorly made drinks, and it took several tries before I could get any type of service, bad or otherwise. Upon telling the bartender that his tequila shot was 'cloudy,' he continued to tell me that this is how he makes his tequila shots and that the short pour was because of the excess of ice cubes. When I didn't receive service, I walked out of the bar, went to Jack Beagles and was finally able to have a drink in a timely fashion. When returning, the attitude continued. I order a couple of more shots, and again, his shots were cloudy, my guess is that is was from dirty shaker cups. When we told him that we order two shots of tequila, and not the cloudy mess he gave us, he proceeded to say that this is how we make our tequila shots and that that's what it is. In asking him who the manager is, he quickly snapped at me and said that he WAS the manager. In asking for two new shots, or my money back, he said that he doesn't do that. I have not ever had this poor of an experience at any bar. Discrimination against homosexuals is not the right thing to do. He should have treated everyone equally, and the clear display of DISCRIMINATION against myself and my party is completely unacceptable.  I shall not be stepping back into your establishment until something is done about it."}
{"text":"Super fun,  especially on Fridays when Sam's the DJ, and Morgan and Kristy (bartenders) are there.  Kristy makes this delicious drink for the ladies that like it sweet but strong,  request rasberry sex on the beach,  it is bliss. Cool place to let loose and be yourself."}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss most nights. Half the time the bartenders and DJ are really rude, depending on the day. It use to be a really great place to come but it has gone down hill within the past year. I'd recommend some of the other new karaoke bars."}
{"text":"When my friend tried closing out last night the bartender claimed my friend must have dropped her card on the ground because she didn't have one under her name. They went back and forth for a few minutes and the bartender then tried giving my friend someone else's card. After my friend refused it because it wasn't her freaking card the bartender (thinking we couldn't see) eventually went into her purse and pulled out my friends card. Home girl thought she was so slick. Good try. Maybe next time. Be wary of this place people. Mad sketch."}
{"text":"They are doing karaoke 7 nights a week now! Not much wait to sing on the slower nights; Mon, Tues and Wednesday."}
{"text":"Came in with a large group just days after Christmas and Trish, the bar back and the karaoke DJ were welcoming and festive! We had a post Christmas gathering with friends and sang our fannies off. Trish and staff went ABOVE AND BEYOND pushing tables together and taking time to talk one-on-one. The night would not have been as memorable if it weren't for this stop! Thank you to \"St Louis\" as I forgot his name (the DJ) for getting us pumped to sing and also allowing group songs. Truly a memorable time with superb staff! Thanks again guys!"}
{"text":"How to describe this place? I think the most accurate description would be a dive bar with really good food. There's not much space to sit, unless you're sitting at the bar. If that's your goal however then hop right on in here, just don't come here on a date trying to have a conversation cause you'll regret it (the music is really really loud)!  They've got local beers, domestic drafts, IPAs you name it they probably have a good selection for your excellent tastes. Check in here on foursquare or yelp and get a free draft as well! I've got to give it to their service for being new they are the friendliest nicest people around. Though maybe they might want to tone it down on the checkins to see if everything is alright. I asked about how a cider tasted and our server described it to me and then he came back with a glass full of it for me to try out. Wow I wasn't expecting that! I ended up ordering a Loco Coco which I did not like so I'm thankful that he brought me some cider on the house that I could enjoy.  Food here is banging, get the Rueben. Trust me gorgeous rye bread toasted nicely with mounds of sauerkraut and corned beef piled inside served with your choice of side. I liked the salt and pepper chips I have no idea where they got them from or if they made them, all I know is that one moment it was there and the next it was all gone. Magic chips I tell you! Somehow they vanished into my mouth.  Great food, friendly people, super chill. Go here to unwind and listen to the cool music or watch a game."}
{"text":"I was really excited to sing a karaoke song...I put my name in at 11pm and stayed until close to wait for my turn to find out that the DJ cancelled my song insisting that it had been played several times since I'd been there...my sober self knew that it had not been played once since I'd been there..I stayed at this sketchy bar for hours for no reason...not coming back"}
{"text":"This is a cool little spot to grab a few beers.  There is a decent draft selection with some local flair and pretty standard prices.  There are TVs set up all around the u-shaped bar so it's good for watching games.  There are also some round high top tables around so you can sit away from the bar as well.  For a pretty small place, they have a really good setup!  They also have a little space for live music.  No food here.  I repeat, no food here.  Just booze.  So plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"This is one of my boyfriend's favorite bars and it's grown on me considerably since I've started going.  I'm not big on karaoke and I have yet to muster up the courage to participate, but my friends love it and this is definitely a great spot for it. If you're looking to do karaoke, get your name on the list early as it tends to fill up.   Ophelia (I'm 80% sure that's her name) has quickly become my favorite bartender. If you get a chance, ask her for a white russian. She proudly claims it's one of her specialties and does NOT disappoint. I've only been to NoDa 101 once when she wasn't working-sadly the bartender who WAS working that night made some pretty bad watered down drinks. Nevertheless, it hasn't ruined my perception of the place or stopped me from going back.  Pros: Great drinks (Seriously, order a white russian) Reasonable prices Very social atmosphere Karaoke if you're into it Great Location  Cons: You have to get there early if you want a seat That one bartender"}
{"text":"My friends and I come to know the 101 at least once a week now! We went there for the first time about a month ago and had a blast. Now we go out there once every weekend in always meet new interesting people. The doorman even watched my coat for me in the bartenders are very nice and efficient, as it is hard to stay professional when you always have that one or two people who are belligerent or rude to them.I haven't done karaoke in almost 8 years and now I sing at least two or three songs every time! Absolute best spot in Noda hands down!"}
{"text":"Nice cozy bar to chill watch multiple large screens & drink!!! The drinks specials are great & cheap!!! Atmosphere is laid back & people are friendly!! The service is great and NoDa 101 is in the center of NoDa!! Cool spot to chill..."}
{"text":"Great place to stop in for a drink during the week, and a fun stop on the weekend to sing some karaoke or watch the game.  The service is always quick and I always have a blast when I'm here.  It draws a fun and mostly local crowd, and the drink specials are hard to beat.  If you're in NoDa, stop in and check it out."}
{"text":"NoDa 101 is your spot if you're into karaoke. While the name lack any creativity at all, this is a pretty fratty bar. It's relatively small with a centralized bar and a stage at the end of the bar where the karaoke goes down. Since the bar is pretty narrow, moving around was pretty tough on a Saturday night. Bros and white girl wasted ladies were singing their hearts out as music blared from the speakers. Holding a conversation is pretty tough but if you're trying to rock out and love karaoke, you'll have a good time."}
{"text":"Although I went to Noda 101 at 9:30 on a Monday night, perhaps the saddest time to go to a karaoke bar, aside from a scenario in which you're alone singing \"Total Eclipse of the Heart,\" I had a wonderful time. The atmosphere is fresh and funky enough and dare I say gay as hell. Although gay people might be the only people sad enough to sing karaoke on a Monday night. Nevertheless, I was very comfortable with getting up on stage and embarrassing myself. Of course that could have been because the bartender kept me L.I.T. all night long with her potent-but-no-trace-of-alcohol beverages."}
{"text":"Excellent karaoke bar.  DJ kept the action going.  Drink prices reasonable.   Becky is an awesome bartender!"}
{"text":"I am not going to write two pages for this review: this place does not need fluff.  Good food, nice bar with lots of TVs and friendly people all around.  Blah blah blah come get a beer."}
{"text":"Great bar, great neighborhood, cold beer and good food.  Not a bad combination for a quick beer and bite in NoDa.  If you haven't been, swing in.  It's much better pricing than you'll find in town and it's relaxing."}
{"text":"Of all the places in NoDa, this place is one of my favorites!  It's quaint, small, quirky and frankly.. what better idea is it than to have a Karaoke Bar open 7 days a week until 2-freakin'-am?! I mean.. Just imagine the type of people who stumble in and out of here.. so it has to be awesome!   It's a great place to either: (a) start your night or  (b) end your night  if you are bar hopping in the area or (c) spend your evening people-watching as they liquid courage their way up to the stage  Come here enough and you'll start to get familiar with the regs such as the older gentleman who karaokes with his trumpet! It's pretty phenomenal if you ask me.   Drinks are not expensive here. Bartenders are pretty great, even on busier nights. Song Book is huge. (Will have no problem picking a song from any random genre your heart desires) Guy checking IDs is hilarious."}
{"text":"Terrible place. Went on 8/1/17. Decided to stop by with a friend for a last round of drinks. We went to the bathroom and one of our bottles accidentally fell on the toilet. I went to let the male barback know and he immediately snapped at me and made remarks. I apologized to him and even then he kept treating me and my friend terrible. We just left our drinks and decided to leave as he just kept shouting things."}
{"text":"Well, I never visited Sin City but I dig the space at NoDa 101.   I popped in for a beer and was happily surprised by the number of local beers they offer. The space itself is fairly small with the bar taking up a majority of the area. Thus, until they make structural changes, be prepared to sit around the bar. If you're a sports fanatic, there's a variety of memorabilia and such amongst the TVs.   But the part that will keep me coming back to NoDa 101 is the really friendly and jovial service. Even though it was my first time at NoDa 101 both the bartender and owner were incredibly friendly. I'm looking forward to heading back here when they add items to their menu and change up the seating options just a bit."}
{"text":"A perfect marriage of two of my favorite things: a dive bar and karaoke.  I love to go out in NoDa and this is a definite stop when I'm in the hood. It's nothing fancy. They do karaoke four nights a week, Thursday-Sunday. There are wacky props and costume like things to play with so you can really take your performance to the next level. Sidenote, I had to upload what may be the best karaoke photo ever of my friend Chris S belting out Benny and Jets, while Joe Joe plays a Guitar Hero guitar. Tremendous.   Street signs decorate the walls along with a deer head that hangs in the middle of the stage area. There's also a pop a shot basketball game and they do have TVs. Drinks are reasonably priced. Ladies please note, the bathroom is a single. Be a pal and don't drag four of your friends inside so you can't bitch about your boyfriend. He'll still be an asshole when you walk out, so don't hold up the line. Hell hath no fury like a drunk woman who needs to pee."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with some coworkers for a couple drinks. They boast a decent selection of beers, bottles and taps, with an ample assortment of NC offerings. From my visit, I couldn't tell if they still serve the food everyone is raving about (though, it was later in the evening).  It's fairly small inside, with most seating at the bar. We didn't stay too long, but I got the impression this is a great hang out in the area. The staff that night was incredibly friendly and did a great job taking care of us. Certainly going to stop in again!"}
{"text":"Only reason I'm giving this place a 5 star review is because I experienced the most magical moment last night. Some dude sang his heart out to \"Circle of Life.\"  It literally brought tears to my eyes. Poor guys credit card kept getting declined so I bought him a beer. He was a nice young man. Hope to enjoy more moments like this here again."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for end of night karaoke if I'm tipsy enough for it. Great place to people watch. The crowd is always friendly when I've gone... Which always happens to be the end of the night... So it could just be the alcohol. Nonetheless it's one of Noda's best spots for me"}
{"text":"Wonderful service...noda brewery on tap...karaoke rockin...have a hop drop and make friends."}
{"text":"This is the best karaoke bar in Charlotte! They have the best bartenders and the DJ's are always friendly even when it gets super crowded on Fridays and Saturdays. This is a bar and there are not so good (drunk) singers but, every now and then some of Charlotte's best talent shows up and it turns into a night you wont forget. During the week is the best time to go if you really like to sing. The list gets very long on the weekends and you may only get to sing once or twice."}
{"text":"My husband is a huge bangles/buckeye fan so you can't beat this place. Good food and cheap beer. Ask for Alex as he'll always take care of you at the bar. This place generally has about 7 customers max but as soon as football season starts back up I'm certain that will change!! If you decide to stop by look for the guy sitting at the bar in the Boomer Esiason and tell him his wife sent you. ;-)  Oh and definitely swing by on For Mexican Mondays for $1.50 tacos that are pretty awesome and $3 margaritas!"}
{"text":"I LOVE NoDa 101. This is one of my favorite places in Charlotte to have a drink and sing karaoke! The crowd is always great. The last time I sung karaoke here.. two girls dragged me on stage to sing \"I'm every woman...\" and WE ALL HAD THE SAME NAME.. wth... where else does this happen... but Noda 101!"}
{"text":"It's a karaoke bar every night.  The drink prices are cheap and the talent is mostly bad but there are always a few diamonds in the rough.  If you like karaoke it's usually got a good crowd, even during the week.  It's exactly what you should expect from a place like this.  ***  I live in the middle of NODA and have been everywhere in the neighborhood many times over the past years. These reviews are a culmination of lots of visits so it's more of a consistency rating than anything.  If you are going out in NODA I've got reviews up of all the places in the neighborhood if you're looking to compare.  ***"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite stops when in NoDa--I always make sure to stop by when I'm in the area.   NoDa 101 is a very small, quirky and unique bar. When you walk in, the room is consumed by the giant bar in the middle. They have a small stage up front for some of the area's best karaoke. There are a couple of arcade games in the bar as well for entertainment...but truly the karaoke is the reason to go!   If you're looking for a bar that's always busy, this is not the place. I've gone in multiple times and been the only person other than the bartender. But at night, especially on the weekends, you can expect a good crowd looking to have fun!"}
{"text":"This is the place to be in Noda! Great staff, karaoke Thursday through Sunday, TV's for sports and great drink specials! I love this bar!"}
{"text":"In the words of rapper Roscoe Dash, \"I had a Good Freakin Night\" at NoDa 101 last night!  As soon as I stepped in the door, I knew I'd found my niche in NoDa. All night long the DJ on duty kept dropping fresh beats and sick mixes that had the peeps in NoDa 101 fist pumping for more! The music playing was a party pleasing mix of techno, dance, top 40's, hip-hop, and a little R & B. So within the music variety there was definitely a little something for everyone to groove to from their bar stool.  Speaking of bar, lets chat about my beverages of choice, and the snazzy bartenders on deck shall we? We shall =) Bee-bopping along with my fellow NoDa 101 bar-mates, the sweet bartender on duty noticed that I was without a beverage, and quickly came to my rescue. After placing my order, I watched as the bartender danced while making my drink. Popping and Locking, snapping and such as he made my Midori Sour and Screwdriver. Amazing drinks, and a show! What-Up!  And he wasn't the only bartender who danced and  attended, in fact the whole staff was in on the jig. Just another thing I love about this place! Perfect drinks, great vibes,sweet beats, and room for rump-shakers like myself!  Taking a seat at the bar, you have your choice of viewing 3 different games plastered across the big screens overhead. Every bar goer's dream, comfy seats and great games! Apparently, NoDa 101 hosts league nights! Sounds like a great future date night for me and my boo! And while tuning into the games, I also plan to dive into the great eats here ! I hear the food is delicious! We'll definitely be partaking in the eats on our next date night,  in addition to our \"shaken, not stirred\" libations ;) See you soon NoDa 101!  =)"}
