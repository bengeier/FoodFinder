{"text":"Used to be nicer it's good now too but they lost the touch..... But it is is always open when you gooo"}
{"text":"Good food, but the delivery waiting time honestly sucks. They need to hire more drivers, seriously! An when I called questioning the whereabouts of my order, I received the poorest, don't care, excuse as to why my orders 2 hours late!? Please guys I'm a big fan, but you have to hire more drivers!"}
{"text":"Took over two hours for food delivery..when we called the woman on the phone made up an excuse about not having my address or phone number when I had given it to her. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Great food and very good sized portions.  This was my first time here and I was impressed. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Went here about a thpusand times and it was always good. The done pita for me is the best in the city. So tender and juicy and very big. Never a bad meal but the inside needs a facelift as it is really old and smells a bit like OLD. But don't be fooled by its looks because the food rocks. The calamari is also excellent and the give a very big portion for the price"}
{"text":"old habits die hard , feeling nostalgic for the hood.  Great memories - food is very good and authentic, Gyros / Doner is the real thing."}
{"text":"BIG plates. My husband couldn't even finish eating my plate after I was full -- usually this is how we share! (He did, however, have room for dessert, a very cinnamony baklava that would have been even better heated up).  YUMMY calamari. The accompanying Greek salad had real vinaigrette, not bottled salad dressing. Next time I'll try the doner.  WARM atmosphere with friendly service. It's not a fancy fancy place but it was clean and quiet and welcoming. We took our time over our early supper and nobody rushed us along. And how many places do you know that have a dental floss dispenser in the bathroom?  Tip:  Directions on the Yelp map said to get off at métro Parc, which was close by (less than 4 blocks). But if you're travelling on the ligne orange and don't want to bother switching lines, it's quite a short walk (10-15 mins) from métro Jean-Talon."}
{"text":"Really delicious greek food, with nice friendly service. Good for vegetarians. They have large portions for good prices. They food quality was really high, with fresh veggies and great donairs."}
{"text":"I always call for delivery when I want a quick fix. They deliver so quick! Their doner meat mix is really great. The greek salad is far from the best thought and the fries are very ordinary. So just go for the doner."}
{"text":"J'ai tellement passé souvent devant ce resto et la devanture ne me donnais pas très envie de rentrer dans ce resto....ET POURTANT...j'aurai dû.  Mes collègues étaient partant pour aller là...et ils étaient 2, alors ils ont gagné la place où il fallait aller dîner. Ils m'ont dit que les portions étaient grosses...j'étais comme oui...comme dans tous les restos grecques...blablabla..tsédodu comme je suis,  je m'en étais capable ERREUR. HEY C'EST UN RESTO POUR LES GENS QUI ONT FAIM!! omg!!! On a tous commander l'assietteS de Gyros....j'ai mis assiettes avec un \"S\", car c'était 2 assiettes et oui.....une moyenne pour le MÉGA GYRO et une hyper grosse avec le riz, salade (avec mega morceau de feta) pis des bonnes frites mmm...   J'ai eu récemment une opération à la bouche....alors le gyro ne rentrait pas...et même si ma bouche avait été en parfaite santé...les bouchées auraient été difficile. La viande était ohhh que délicieuse...des parties tendres, juteuses, \"broils\"...bref délicieux...le tout avec des tranches de tomates...oignon et sûrement de la laitue et le tout garni de sauce  tzatziki aussi gros que le sandwich en tant que tel...   Je souhaite vraiment retourner un jour avec quelqu'un'un pour partager un plat à 2...car le plat est immense et essayer les calmars...!  Je ne met pas 5*, car malgré toutes les célébrités (genre BILL CLINTON OMGGG), et les nombreux merveilleux avis dans les médias...la place n'a pas d'l'air très propre. Par contre j'adore l'effet vieillot... La serveuse est vraiment sympathique et on reçoit un bonbon à la menthe à la fin YESSS Croyez-moi que ça aide beaucoup...car le goût de l'ail reste longtemps dans notre gorge!!! À oui aussi...même si la salade était très fraiche....j'avais l'impression qu'il n'y avait pas de vinaigrette.. :(  BREF MERCI LE VILLAGE JE VOUS AIMES!!"}
{"text":"Recommended to me by my Greek friend who says that Village Grec is as good as it gets in Canada. They deliver which is a great, but should you choose to dine-in you get to watch the amazing Village Grec promo reel in a continuous loop."}
{"text":"The food taste better than what the place looks. This is one of these neighborhood favorites. Part of you wishes that they would renovate something in there... but there's the fear of change, what if the food changed!  Everything they make is pretty good. The chicken gyro salad is my personal favorite. The tzaziki can be toxic at times. Now I love garlic, but I'm talking paint stripper strong!   If you've never been... Go! But keep in mind this is a tshirt place, not a first date option."}
{"text":"The gyro is not what one would expect. They offer very generous portions. It is a  ute little restaurant that has been around for a long time. People are friendly , and I'm sure that other menu items would be tasty , I just wasn't too pleased with my choice."}
{"text":"Tiny hole in the wall Greek diner full of history on Jean Talon with the best food. The walls along one side are hung with framed pictures of visiting notables including Bill and, a little further along, Hillary. The doners are so moist and delicious, and we also love the pikilia plate (taramosalata heaven) the chicken skewers with rice, the calamari, and the lamb chops. It's cozy and family-noisey and fun and even a little romantic to eat in at Village Grec, but the best news on cold and rainy (and/or lazy) days is that they deliver!"}
{"text":"I usually just pop in to get some quick takeout from this place from time to time and it is ALOT of food for the price. Great for when you want no fuss and are hungry like wolf!"}
{"text":"The one and original Village Grec. Ultimate Casse croute Greek junk food. This is what my Greek friends call it. Or you could declare it Greek diner food. A little bit gritty on the inside but not unclean, just old in decor.  However glorious huge portions and inexpensive amazing value! This is a true hidden hole in the wall. I've come here twice in the last few weeks. Firstly how can you go wrong with a loaded gyros of pork/lamb for under $5? Secondly the Calamari is one of the biggest servings I've ever seen in a restaurant. Think family sized portion for Calamari. My usual meal here is a gyros platter. It comes as for mentioned with a heaping g-yro. rice, fries and Greek salad. They only run one Chicken Gyros spinning around on the turntable heat lamp a day.  So of you come late night you will be relegated to grilled chicken kebabs. The pork/lamb meat spinning around is the way to go for me! Super flavourful and moist and delicious. If you are a hungry person or like copious fat-man portions this is your sandbox. It's my go to place and has been an institution in Parc-X for many years. Service has been cordial on my visits and I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by this hole in the wall on my way home some time ago and went with the fabled reviews of their DONER PITAS. So, I ordered some for take-out and headed home.  The DONER Pita was excellent, big, moist, flavorful and well-made... I quickly ravished it. I truly recommend you to try it as well. The side-order of fries was very good as well.  The take-out was done in about 15 minutes and the price-tag was very good with food court prices but restaurant quality food.  I'm a fan, I'd go back."}
{"text":"To be honest, the food was very good. Normally, I'd rate this a 4. However, during our \"adventure\" there were many things that did NOT deserve four stars.  First, while the people seem very nice, they didn't really notice anything (like if you wanted something else, you basically had to hold your hand up for 7 minutes straight), and the food only came after 25 minutes. I don't really mind, as I'm used to waiting for things (especially at restaurants, because come on). But it was kind of annoying.  Second, there was no soap in the bathroom. Again, normally I wouldn't really care (I don't use restaurant bathrooms, I just appreciate a good hand-washing after dinner), but I'm pretty sure they're supposed to have soap anyway.   Third, there was a dead caterpillar in my rice. I didn't SUPER mind it (I mean, it's not like it was a cockroach or anything). But they did NOT apologize, and one person (the boss!) refused to admit that it was a bug (claiming it was a single burnt piece of rice) even though all of us (a party of 3, along with two members of staff) agreed that it was a bug.   Overall, I was not very satisfied. (Although I will note that their cook washed his hands often, which I appreciate)."}
{"text":"I really liked this place... good vibes with great service and food. There food portions are generous. I ordered the Soulvaki chicken plate and finished all of it! Very delicious meals with decent house wine. I was also impressed by their attentive service- the server offered me extra tissues for the baby.  Small gestures like these win me over! Plus point: my 4 month old baby boy loved it too... because their walls were so full of photos and colors :)"}
{"text":"Familiar with the word DONER?  (Yes, with a D, please.)  A) If so, please skip the following and head straight to the Village Grec.  B) No?!  Then read on.    The doner is actually a mixed meats vertical roast, similar to the arab \"shawarma\" or the \"shish taouk\".  Village Grec's roast is made from a mix of pork, lamb and beef.  To that they add some fat to keep the roast super moist as well as slices of tomatoes and onions to add some taste.    (More info on Wikipedia:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyro_(food) & http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doner_kebab)   I discovered Village Grec in the mid 90's when my dad's childhood [Greek] friend talked to him about it and how this was the best place in or around town for gyros (pronounced \"yeeroh\"; another term used for doners).  Ever since then, I've been hooked.  Every once in a while, we'd go eat there or take-out a few pita sandwiches filled with tomatoes, onions, herbs and crispy yet juicy doner meat. Y.U.M.M.Y.  And now, over 15 years later and almost 30, VG's reputation still stands and the food is as delicious as it was when I was a kid!  I still find the owner in the kitchen prepping his clients' favourite platters and sandwiches.  As for the customers per se, you'll find there a variety of different people; from the little groups of youngsters at night, to the workers coming in singles for lunch and the yuppies meeting up for a quick bite after work... without forgetting the Greeks of all ages (always a *good* sign the food and service are great).   If I go with a group of friends, we often order little mezze to nibble on before our pièce de résistance; I would definitely recommend you try the fried calamari (good to share with *at least* 3 other people if you have a full plate of meat/sandwich + salad + fries and/or rice), the pikilia (I believe the word actually means \"a selection of\" or \"a variety of\" and the plate is a selection of mezze - VG serves the most popular, e.g.: olives, tzatziki, taramosalata, feta, tiropita, spanakopita and dolmadakia) and the loukaniko (Greek sausage).    I like to have my gyro with just salad and fries - which I love to dip in the dripping tzatziki and even sometimes put in my sandwich (that's apparently how the Greeks do it!).  While it is an exquisitely delicious, it is quite a heavy meal; if I have it for lunch, then I only eat a very light dinner if I have it for dinner, then... I go for a 5 hour run before going to bed (well, er, no, I really don't... but you know what I mean ;p ).   Kali Orexi ! ;-)   PS Bring cash... as I have never seen the interact or credit card machine work."}
{"text":"super doner gyros. meat is moist and super juicy. very generous on the meat.  one of my favorite souvlakis places in mtl!"}
{"text":"Although I was very disappointed last time I was here , this time was pretty good with a very nice portion. I ordered the yero platter no fries or rice and I got meat meat and meat.....it was great and I can actually taste the lamb. Nice...."}
