{"text":"If you're looking for a place to relax, create, or get inspired. THIS IS IT! Very homie vibes. I've had the maple coconut specialty coffee one of my favorites so far. Plan on coming back to try the rest."}
{"text":"Omg great cappuccino. I added the nutty flavoring they have and it was amazing. I wanted a second. The have a small selection of pastries from the gluten free bakery down the street. Since they are gluten free they are a bit pricey. The shop is really cute. But we were the only people in there and the music was slow jazz so I felt like barista could hear all of our conversation. So it made it a little uncomfortable and we felt like we had to whisper. I'd recommend coming for sure. The flavor of the cappuccino was worth the awkward silence."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the east end of Lakewood. Good coffee with a creative twist if you prefer--house made syrups like cardamom and clove. Great vibe. Gluten free pastries too!"}
{"text":"Stood at the counter reading the selections while the guy was making a coffee and did not acknowledge me.  He delivered a coffee to a table and I overheard that it was what was not what was ordered. He came back around the counter and stood there staring  at me, again nothing out of his mouth. I finally asked, what a spiced Viennese was and he said he didn't know, then stood there staring at me, I was done, walked out.  This guy looked like he just rolled out of bed, look of disinterest and as if I was a bother.  Not only was I disappointed but in awe of how you could employ this person.  There are so many that need jobs and would be grateful, not this moron. I will never return to your business.  1 star because I am forced to rate to post, otherwise no star!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop reminds me of a west side Algebra Teahouse, where the interior was clearly created with warmth and care - featuring handmade wooden tables, a counter recycled with loading pallets and coffee burlap sacks, and murals painted on the walls. Beverage offerings differ than anywhere else, where you can get beverages inspired by the spices of the Middle East, such as Moroccan spiced coffee and Qishr (a fruity coffee tea made from coffee bean husks and spices). This place is also open till 9 pm everyday. Glad to see a shop open up on the east end of Lakewood!!"}
{"text":"This place has everything I need. I usually need good coffee. Lol Amazing ambiance. Warm and gracious small business owners. Homemade syrups (cardamom clove, coconut maple), and fresh pastries! I come here whenever I'm in town. You have to check out Maison Palette!"}
{"text":"This place was a hidden gem i stumbled upon. This place is super authentic with a great atmosphere. The coffee shop owner, Wall, was super friendly and happy to converse about business and life. He made me a great cappuccino presented on a wood coaster with beautiful latte art and all.   On top of that his is a great place to sit and work from my computer, and parking was plentiful in the surrounding are, unlike the neighboring Ohio city coffee shops where parking is an expensive hassle.   Go here and support a great guy and a great place!"}
{"text":"I only had a red eye, but it was very smooth and had great flavor, looking forward to trying other coffees and espressos. The shop is clean and atmosphere is relaxed. A perfect coffee shop."}
{"text":"Not only fantastic coffee but owner is incredibly genuine and friendly!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite coffee spot. The coconut maple is excellent! They also have nitro which I like! After the second time there, they had learned my name. The gentleman in the morning is very personable. A good coffee and a good conversation to start the day!"}
{"text":"This is a great coffee shop addition to the west side! For the size of Lakewood, it's severely lacking in great coffee establishments. La Maison Palette does a great job of filling the need for great coffee in this part of town!  La Maison Palette specializes in coffees with homemade flavorings. The Moroccan Spice coffee is really good. There's also a lavender coffee and maple just to name a few!  The staff was super friendly and attentive too!"}
{"text":"If you are in line for Starbucks on Clifton right now, turn around. Drive up to Detroit and visit La Maison Palette! This place is the definition of a small small local business and they deserve your money. Every time I visit you can just tell how grateful the staff is for your business. They are always incredibly gracious and friendly. One of the things that stands out to me is that they stop to wash their hands before preparing your coffee. They offer an array of international coffees, teas and beverages served in eco-friendly to-go cups. Stop by for local gluten free baked goods and a Moroccan spice coffee."}
{"text":"I just love La Maison Palette. It offers quality coffee drinks that are delicious and complex in flavor. So far, I've had their Nitro coffee, Coconut Maple blend, cappuccino and their mocha. I've loved everything I've had. I will say that their mocha is out of this world. I don't usually order mochas because they tend to be too sweet. The flavor of the chocolate they use stands out from any other mocha I've ever had. This place also has a great atmosphere. It's a great place to hang out with your friends. The owners are super friendly. Overall, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great spot! It's different from other coffee spots in the area and I love that. Lots of room, great tea and wifi."}
{"text":"I just love this place. The Moroccan coffee was wonderful. The barista made it on his first day of work and nailed it. I would definitely go here on the East side of Lakewood."}
{"text":"The best Americano I've had in Cleveland with a unique selection of spiced coffees, in a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Super cute and new coffee/tea spot in Lakewood. They opened in February 2017 and it's now September 2017. The name of the coffee shop is in French and it translates to \"The House of Pallets.\" Read on further to discover why the coffee shop is named this way.  I ordered the Rooibus tea and vegan brownie. The brownie is sourced from the Bouche Bakery. The tea was great but the brownie could have tasted better because it was somewaht hard and not soft/fresh. It probably had just been sitting out the whole day. I think if they served the brownie slightly warm by heating it in a microwave then it would have tasted better. Yet again, I didn't ask because I didn't feel like it...haha. My roommate ordered the Moroccan Spice blend coffee and absolutely loved it.  I came here last weekend with my roommate to do some homework and this was a perfect location for that because it's small and quiet. There were only 3 other people inside when I arrived on a Sunday afternoon and a 4th person appeared later. If you're looking for a quiet spot to study then this is it. If you come on a busy week or weekend then there might not be ample seating because this shop is small but you should be fine.  I moved to the Cleveland almost 5 weeks ago and I'm glad that I've discovered this place. It is owned by husband and wife couple so I was happy to be supporting a local small business.   I love how the coffee shop is decorated in wood (wood tables and walls) - basically, wooden pallets. Hence, the name of the store is \"The House of Pallets\" in English. I read online that Wael, one of the owners, likes wood pallets so that's where the idea for the name came from.   While there, I had a nice chat with the owners Wael Farhan (husband from Belgium) and Kyra Frierson (wife from Cleveland). We chatted about Cleveland, Africa, their business, etc. They seem very passionate about their business. I did notice that they were seating at the last table behind me because other seating was available but I'm sure if a customer came in and asked for a seat then they would have glady given that seat to the customer."}
{"text":"What a lovely little coffee shop. I had a delicious cafe mocha this afternoon and look forward to trying the other menu items soon. The vibe is relaxed and the table/chairs are great for setting up your laptop and papers or having a nice chat with friends. I wish there were some cushioned chairs or a couch that might be more ideal for reading but otherwise this seems to be a neighborhood gem and I look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Very surprised at my experience here after reading all of these reviews. It was definitely a cute shop with lots of character, but I'm disappointed with it. First, there are only 5 tables and one was occupied by the barista. He didn't even say hello or greet me when I walked in, and I honestly thought he was just another customer until he walked behind the counter. I could hardly hear when what he was saying to me and he was certainly not personable. He luckily let me use the table he was at after I asked if there was any additional seating, which I very much appreciated. All in all this place didn't rope me in and I don't feel the need to go back. Average coffee, below average experience."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, friendly staff, delicious coffee & pastries! Very eco-friendly too. This place is a lot quieter and laid back/less crowded than Root Cafe, which I really enjoy."}
