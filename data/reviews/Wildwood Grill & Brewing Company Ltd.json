{"text":"I visited this restaurant for a special occasion. Great fresh and diverse ingredients. W hotel style meets the wild west = Wildwood. If there is another special occasion, I would love to revisit."}
{"text":"Wildwood represents upscale Alberta or Rockies style dining.  The prices are a bit high, but this is a fine restaurant.    The homemade beers are great.  I had a Cherry Ale along with a Duck Confit Pizza, both were rich and flavourful  The decor is nice, service is proffessional, and ambiance is very Canadian - layed back luxury."}
{"text":"Returned to the Wildwood yesterday for the first time in a couple of years.  Food was excellent (I had the lamb burger) and the service was pretty good.  Try the Cherry ale.  Yum!"}
{"text":"If you're in the mood for some expensive, Texan-style food, then Wildwood is the way to go.  If I wasn't dragged here with a work function, then I would certainly be staying away from this place.  I couldn't believe it when I opened the menu and saw the prices of everything.  I make less in an entire week than these people are charging for an appetizer.  I couldn't believe it and immediately thought the food better be made out of gold for those prices.  You know what?  It was gold!  It was so delicious and tasty and mouth-watering good, I immediately knew the prices were worth it - almost.  The table ordered a $145 bottle of wine, which I thought was ridiculous.  I'm no wine connoisseur, but I'm pretty sure that the $19 bottles I usually buy tasted about the same as the one seven times that amount.  Good thing I wasn't paying because I would be in debt after the amount spent at this dinner.  I will say that the food was wonderful and the inside has a nice, authentic Texan feel to it.  I believed that I was down South enjoying some good old barbequed Texas meat and potatoes!"}
