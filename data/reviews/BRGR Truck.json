{"text":"It was nice to see a food truck on the streets (ok, a parking lot) of Pittsburgh. I got an Average Joe and chips, which came out to $10.70. This was more than my normal lunch but it was nice to have something hot, fresh, and most importantly tasty. The chips were to die for. The dip that comes with it is spicy but well rounded. The burger was amazing. Juicy and fresh its much better than the other burger places downtown and even in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I thought the fries were pretty good, but I wanted more from my burger.  I am a real burger lover and I was really hoping for more.  I want a burger that will make me swoon.  I think that's what BRGR is selling, but not what I'm tasting."}
{"text":"So I finally got to visit the BRGR truck. I walked outside at work downtown and followed my nose to right outside of the Oxford Center Building where the truck resides. They offer a slimmed down version of their restaurant menu which includes beef, veggie or turkey burgers(your choice) and various sides. The burgers are $7 and the sides are typically $3. I got the steak burger very pink and it was delicious. It's not as good as the competition's steak house burger(Burgatory) but it still satisfied. The staff are friendly and very quick. I waited less than 5 minutes for my burger. It was as I ordered it, very pink and and presented well with a wooden holder to hold it together. They also offer shakes as well, just like the competition. I still say if you want just a plain cheeseburger that Tessaro's has the best tasting beef in Pittsburgh. But, if you work downtown and you want a delicious burger with multiple options, then this truck is for you. I will be going back again soon as it was pretty good for a food truck."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience at their East Liberty restaurant but being the good Christian that I am I decided to give their food truck a shot.  The truck has a smaller menu compared to the actual restaurant featuring the following five different burgers:  The Average Joe (lettuce, tomato, onion, with or without cheese) Fire In The Hole (guacamole, jalape√±os, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayo, sriracha) Shrooms (forest mushrooms, caramelized onions, brie cheese, mustard aioli) Cease & Assist (American cheese, caramelized onions thousand island dressing) Daily Brgr (The burger of the day)  I had a Average Joe with bacon and fries. It was cooked perfectly and so juicy and full of flavor. It was absolutely delicious! The fries had that perfect snap to them also, crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside.  There was a long line but, it went pretty quickly. It's been a few years so I think I will give the East Liberty spot another try as well."}
{"text":"Was excited to see a food truck downtown.  I parked in the strip, and walked about 15 minutes to get to it.  The pricing was a little high in my opinion.  $8 for a burger.  It was pretty meaty, but still $8 is a lot.  That being said, I don't like massive meat patties on burgers.  All I could taste was the beef, and not the toppings.  I know some people like that, but it's not for me.  I always order a little burger at 5 guys too, because I like to taste toppings in addition to the burger.  Like I said, some people will like that, but it's not for me.  They have interesting burgers of the day.  Mine had pot roast and onion rings on it.  I thought it was pretty unique, and had a good taste.  Overall, I'd say if you like the kind of burgers they serve, it's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"This was a really good, juicy burger! I got the shrooms burger. I got it at the truck at the three rivers arts festival rather than the restaurant. This burger has made me want to check out the actual restaurant and order a milkshake, too!"}
{"text":"I'm talking bout cheese guys.  This girl loves her cheeses, gooey, smokey, tasty cheese and that will lead me into the BRGR food truck fries experience the fries were served covered in Parmesan and herbs and were pipping hot and the portion was gigantic. I was geeked by the portion size because I was only having the fries for lunch. I was so far gone off these fries I ate 'em all.  Food Trucks FTW."}
{"text":"Probably the worst meal of our trip.  Parts of it were inedible. The avocado and bacon. The salmon burger gave me indigestion. When we mentioned it no offer to take the extras off.  The service was friendly enough."}
{"text":"The BRGR truck is now parked at the parking lot across from the courthouse(Forbes & Grant) M-F, 11a-3p. This is a nice addition to the downtown lunch scene, especially in light of Winghart's closing for renovations. The truck has a pared-down menu consisting of about 5 beef/veggie/turkey burgers(All around $8), 3 sides($3), basic shakes($4), and a few daily specials. Interestingly, the truck has brought back BRGR's old 'Add Foie Gras to anything' policy - $12 extra gets you a slice of guilty decadence.   The service on the truck is pretty quick, our burgers were ready in under 10 minutes from ordering, served to us in paper boat trays wrapped in tin foil. There isn't really anywhere to sit in the parking lot of the truck, so you'll need to have somewhere else to eat, especially in the cold. Additionally, we went around 1pm and there was a short line of about 3 people.   For more about the burgers you can read any one of the numerous reviews at the restaurant. The food here is identical, definitely not my favorite burgers in town. My burger tasted like it got an excessive salt rub - big crunchy hunks of salt were charred to the bottom of my burger, and while I like salty food, it was way too much, and overpowered the tiny bit of chipotle mayo.   Moreso than its food though, the BRGR TRCK(ha) is important politically. Pittsburgh's laws on food trucks are arcane and are inhibiting a lot of great businesses that are now operating only at events. You can read more about the effort to get Pittsburgh's laws changed here: http://pghmobilefood.com/ . In the meantime though, BRGR's truck is getting the word out that trucks can provide quick, affordable lunches, and increase the diversity of available food to downtown workers that would be otherwise unaware of these issues.  So, go out and grab a burger and help Pittsburgh catch up to other cities with great and vibrant food truck communities.    Additional note: You can get the truck at your event/business for a minimum food purchase of $500 for the first 2 hours. More info on the website. Cards accepted, too."}
{"text":"I ordered a Veggie burger with no cheese, a couple bites in I realized I got a real burger with cheese, I went back to the truck to get a replacement and got a veggie burger WITH CHEESE.   I wouldn't be as upset but paying $14 for my  lunch and it being wrong twice it just a little annoying.  If you are a vegan be sure to double check everything or else you will just waste your money."}
{"text":"We tried BURGR at Recon Brewing last night. My hubs and I both ordered the Cease and Desist, but I got the veggie burger. We also got 2 sides of fries with \"crack sauce,\" and a cookies and cream shake. The wait wasn't too long for as busy as they were.   My burger was fried and on the hard side. It was a falafel mix patty that was almost identical to what I've had at Pig Iron in Cranberry. It's overly salty. The Cease and desist comes with caramelized onion, cheese, and thousand island. There was barely any dressing on the sandwich and it had soaked into the bun. Also no lettuce or tomato on it which I didn't realize, so sandwich was dry. The whole wheat bun was tasty but I don't think it was warmed up at all.   Fries were tasty, but I didn't like the crack sauce. I guess I thought it would be a mayo based dipping sauce but it was like a chili cheese dip. I mixed my own sauce with mayo, ketchup, and mustard packets they gave me, and also dipped my burger in it, which helped with the dryness. I didn't have a bite of my hubby's sandwich but he said he felt it needed more sauce too. He loved the brioche bun and said the meat tasted like good quality. The shake was really good but suuuuper sweet. My kids loved it, of course!   The total bill came to $39 with tip. Ultimately, for someone who orders a veggie burger I have had better veggie burgers at other Burger places in Pittsburgh. I wish veggie burgers weren't treated as such a throwaway item at restaurants, especially when you're paying $9 for it."}
{"text":"I had a turkey burger with cheese and milkshake that made me want to immediately pack up all my things at my desk and leave work. It was that great! In fact it was the highlight of my eight hour workday. I don't eat beef or pork and was ecstatic that turkey was even an option. It was cooked just right and boy it was juicy. I wanted to finish all of it but my stomach was all \"girl you're full.\" The milkshake wasn't watery it was thick and packed with flavor and I just can't wait to spot this truck again. It gets five stars. I would give it six but for obvious reasons I cannot. I've been to the restaurant BRGR and I'm excited it now comes to you."}
{"text":"This is my first time eating a burger that came off of a food truck and this will probably be my last time.  I got the Average Joe and it was just okay.   I've definitely had better burgers.     It wasn't an awful tasting burger but it was incredibly mediocre and boring.  The reason why I will never eat here again is because I got violently sick immediately after eating this burger.    It has been hours since I've eaten this devil and it is still wreaking havoc on my digestive tract.      Taste - just okay Cleanliness / sanitation - very poor - stay away"}
