{"text":"Thank you to my new friends at IOS. It was my first stop in Charlotte and I had a wonderful experience. Everyone was extremely nice and the food was delicious. Special shout out to my awesome host, Brent and compliments to the chef for an added special touch on the dishes. Hope to see you all again soon."}
{"text":"Food way just okay. Service was painfully slow. It was more of a fast food experience."}
{"text":"If you're considering this establishment in the last hour it's open, reconsider. My friends and I ate here while AA5 was going on one night, and after they sat us we realized the restaurant closed in about 45 minutes. Feeling bad, we tried to order quickly so that we did not keep them any later than they needed to be open. There were at least 3 other tables there when we arrived but the looks the servers gave us made us feel unwelcome.  Once we ordered our server became  overly attentive, to the point we felt uncomfortable. At times we were forced to listen to her 5 minute life stories every time she refilled our waters. It was beyond weird to be listen to someone talking about how excited they were for the baby they are pregnant with to be gone so you can get back to partying and living your life. No customer wants to hear that...  In the end, 5/6 of us ordered food (all different entrees from gyro platter,  burger pita, and lamb skewers) , and 4/5 of us got food poisoning that night. I myself, only had their wedge salad (with no meat) and was immediately sick upon getting home.  I've worked in the food industry for 10+ years and know the unfortunate timing of a customer coming in towards the end of the night. We were not rude, we left before they closed, and still had a poor experience. It would not surprise me if the staff did something intentional to make us sick based on the stares we got.   I would not return, or recommend this restaurant to anyone. There are plenty of other great places here in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Best chicken wings I've had( plain)...OMG!!! And the everyone is so awesome. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Not worth it! I ordered the gyro pita and fries. Wait was too long; gyro was just ok; fries had a hard & chewy taste - Taste Like Cardboard! And I like fries! but I just couldn't bare the cardboard taste any longer so threw over half of them out! On top of everything else the wait was too long. Waited at least about 20 min for this in an uncrowded restaurant where I was the only to go order. Not worth the wait. I feel like I was ripped off and just wasted $10 plus!! OVERPriced. Never again!"}
{"text":"Service was good, food, not good. Calamari was under cooked. Ordered veggie platter bc server said quinoa was good. Quinoa was cold, bland and completely unimaginative. Carrot and hummus dips were good but the portions were paltry, except for the salad (disproportionately large)  which was not good. The lamb skewer was barely warm when it can out and on top of stale pita, tasted okay. It's sad to me how bad food can be in a restaurant when there's so much potential."}
{"text":"If there was a way to give negative stars, I would.   Cons: The service was slow; the wings tasted like fish (we were told it was the garlic they used and that other people had said the same thing); then the checks were wrong.  We asked the server to correct them, and the kid could not do simple math; we had to explain that $9.50 divided by 2 is not $5.25.  Pros: We sent back the wings, and the replacements were better. Neither time did the food take very long. The server was fairly friendly, but what should have been maybe a 45 minute event took over an hour and a half. He did correct the checks after we asked, and he did apologize. It was a Tuesday and not crowded. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I would have given this place 4 stars as the food is actually pretty good, however the service is lacking and could use some improvement. To start, we ordered  the hummus and friends appetizer which was tasty however the pita bread to dip ratio was completely off. Be prepared to ask for extra bread and then wait a long time for it to arrive. When our food finally arrived, my boyfriend was informed by another waitstaff member that our server \"forgot to put the order in\" and that it would take an extra ten minutes to prepare his initial order. Seriously, how do you forget to put an order in? We were told they could whip up an alternate dish in a minute which is what we did given we did not want to wait ten minutes. Go figure, 5 minutes later the alternate dish came out. What left an unpleasant taste is the fact that our server did not acknowledge or apologize for the snafu, nor did he try and comp the forgotten dish, the hummus or even a drink.. Again, tasty food, but not so good service."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  It is nice and open with a nice, chill atmosphere.  The food is amazing, with a fresh, authentic Greek menu.  There is also a bar and the service was prompt and awesome.  Will definitely return.   The chicken souvlaki pita is A+"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend came here before seeing a movie.  Their menu isn't too extensive, but the food is pretty good. Had the gyro platter, and some appetizers. The prices aren't bad either.  I like the whole outdoor/indoor seating and also the bar area. Not too many drinks to choose from, but the drinks we had were really good. Service was alright, no one asked me if I wanted another drink, but that's money lost on their part.  The restaurant itself is small, but it's a really cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped here after attending a club around 1 am. Was like what the hell im hungry and this place is open... Got wings and a Gyro sampler. Awesome! Price point, plus good quantity, and most importantly, flavor! Must stop here!"}
{"text":"We arrived here late and thus were only able to choose from the late-night menu.  We ordered a gyro platter, crispy calamari and a couple of drinks. The calamari was drizzled with a white sauce and very fried so we did not care for that. However, the cocktails and the gyro platter were delicious. Our server was also fantastic. Overall we enjoyed this place."}
{"text":"Brand new greek place that opened.  Came here to celebrate my cousins graduation.  The beers on draft are very flavorful and didn't disappoint.   The staff is very attentive and friendly.   For aps we had the octopus, lamb pops, cheese in a cast iron skillet, greek pizza, and calamari.   All were unique and cooked really well.  I was surprised how well the octopus was cooked.  At the end of our meal the chef came out to ask how we liked the meal.  Give this place a try."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a bite and relax. My favorite menu items are their wings, the chicken souvlaki and the spicy shrimp appetizer. Their location is great due to the huge open bar that faces the center/main floor of the epicenter. They can open or close a huge door to bring the outside in on warm days. The staff are very nice and helpful. The food comes out pretty quick. I've never had a bad experience here. It has become one of my regular spots."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot--love the Greek salad. Prices are fair. Each time I've visited service is awful. Not sure the Greek salad is worth the awful service. May just utilize them for takeout going forward."}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch spot.  First lets talk about the decor. It's amazing, and believe me, I am the LAST person to comment on something like this. Usually I am all about the food and that's all. But the ambiance literally puts me in a better mood, it weird. I feel like I'm in a Mediterranean sea town.  The food is also fantastic don't worry. The falafel pita is fantastic with generous potions, but with light taziki and red spouts. The bread itself is very delicious as well. The French fries are very very very good (that is 3 'very's). Maybe it's just my cup of tea, but I LOVE skinny fries. They are light but gluttonous at the same time.  The service is always great, the food is out timely and the people are nice. Manager stops by to check. Their 'plates' are wooden cutting boards! How cool is that! (not super cool, it's a novelty and not a big deal, but it's just like damn, these people designed a really cool/nice Greek place)  Usually it is pretty empty, but don't let that deter you! It's one of me and my wife's favorite places to eat lunch."}
{"text":"Great location. Waitress a bit slow, but to her defense looked like she was on her own. Food wasn't half bad, a bit salty on the lamb. Overall had fun and would still consider coming back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a delicious lunch this afternoon. Started off with a shrimp garlicky appetizer with green hummus and crispy pita chips.  Recommend the Gyro with the side of the Greek salad instead of the green salad. Atmosphere is very open air and pleasurable to people watch."}
{"text":"The EpiCentre is one of my preferred places to take out of town guests due to the variety of activities, pedestrian friendly layout, and ample parking, but while I enjoy several of the restaurants located there, most of them are loud and chaotic.  IOS is something of a shelter in the storm, with an aesthetically appealing and colorful decor that feels open thanks to the glass façade yet is insulated from all the noise.   It is one of the increasingly rare places where you can sit with a group and comfortably have a conversation, while the warm and vibrant atmosphere makes me reluctant to leave.    I have been there once on a blind date and once following a Hornets game with a group of six, including two toddlers, with both experiences being extremely positive.  Frankly I was surprised that a new dining establishment in that location with such a modern décor would be as inexpensive as it was, yet the portions were filling and the meat in particular was more generous than some other Greek restaurants I frequent.  Although I have yet to try much of the menu, both entrées I had were tasty and filling while the salads were fresh despite the late hour of my most recent trip, and everyone else expressed pleasure with their choices.   On both occasions the service was pleasant and engaging, but our server Andrew deserves particular credit for doing such a good job with the larger group.  I can't speak to any issues of other reviewers, as my experiences were wholly enjoyable, but having been to Greece several times I will note that a traditional Greek salad (horiatiki) has no lettuce at all.  American versions typically do, but a truly traditional one will not.  Be sure to ask the server if you have any questions, as ours were able to explain what is contained in each dish.  IOS is not fast food, so it might not be the best choice if you need to be in and out quickly, but if you have the time to sit and enjoy an inexpensive meal in the company of others then I can't think of a better place in the center of the city."}
{"text":"Nice bar if you can get service from the bartender who keeps flirting with one patron, or the other one who is just doing nothing."}
{"text":"Meh. I love the ambiance of indoor/outdoor eating, but the food is pretty average. The DIP TRIO is strange, with one a fairly flavorless yogurt and another a carrot purée. Served with fried (hard and greasy) pitas, this is not an item I'd try again.   The PITAs are decent.  FALAFEL is fried nicely with a good flavor and texture. The SOUVLAKI CHICKEN is flavorful. But the pitas... Not that great. I've consistently found mine to be hard and almost stale. I typically end up eating only the insides of the pita. The lunch french fries have been hit or miss for me. One time they were pretty good, another they were stale and cold.  The chipotle dipping sauce is great as well as the goddess dressing.  Service is another area that's not quite up to par. Don't expect to be greeted by a hostess right away, and the interior set up is confusing about where to even find a hostess.  I've eaten lunch several times here without any napkins or silverware on the table. One time my husband and I shared silverware that he snagged from a different open table for the entire meal because we couldn't get the attention of any servers.   I will continue to eat here because I like the ambience and the food is an interesting new addition for uptown. But I really hope that some of these problem issues get resolved or I'll be moving onto the next new thing."}
{"text":"This place is new and fantastic.  I got the chicken shwarma and it was delicious! Order it just the way it comes, the grilled zucchini and pickled onions are a great add to the chicken that is marinated nightly. The pita bread was great and ingredients tasted so fresh! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Great spot if you work uptown! I've been here at least 3 times and I normally don't post great/horrible reviews unless I am very impressed by their quality or upset haha. You have got to try this food"}
{"text":"Everything  was perfect ... but 1 thing when you tell me you'll be right back to take my order then go away for ten min then tell me when you come back you'll be right back to take my order its an over promised under delivered position and I would typically deduct a star ...."}
{"text":"Very  small portions for the price . The Greek salad appeared large until you realized it was mostly cheese and onions and very little lettuce . The lamb skewers were pathetic . You get two for 9.50 . It tasted like cheap frozen meat . And they were so small , I could of ordered 4 just to have a filling meal . On the bright side , the chicken gyro was large and flavorful . The Parmesan French fries were good . But not so special . With that said , I cannot recommend . I would look for other options if you are looking for Greek cuisine . I might add the two others in my party agreed . And did not care for their food ."}
{"text":"Outstanding meal and service! Wanted something a little different and tried the trout with lemon butter sauce & capers, also the Greek mac & cheese.  Very delicious and not too heavy. Asha took great care of us and also made excellent recommendations. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food... Great chicken wings, pitas and the baklava is heavenly... This was the best dinner I have had at a Greek place..."}
{"text":"The menu is limited, but I attribute that to the location. The service was great and the wait (for the kitchen) was reasonable. We had the chicken wing appetizer and they were amazing, portion was great and the wings were flavorful. The only disappointment was the Parmesan fries. For the price of $6 on any, I expect real cooked Parmesan fried not just the grated cheese sprinkled on. Other than that I would definitely go back. The falafel was great!"}
{"text":"Brand new Greek THEME restaurant in the Epicenter. We were ALL very excited to learn that a new Greek joynt is opening in the Epicentre!  Great location and vibe. Greeted by a friendly server and he explained the menu.....for those not familiar with Greek food. HE was the one who emphasized the \"theme\" part of Greek. The menu looks Greek but this is NOT authentic Greek food. Not saying it's bad just not true Greek.  So my usual lunch crowd all order different things. Most got some form of Gyro. I asked if it came off the rotating roaster and the Chef said yes but they keep it in the back. I opted for the Gyro Platter which csme with......a....GULP.....bland iceburg salad! Huh? No flavor no taste. Thankfully the lady Manager noticed my horrified look and offered to substitute a real Greek salad, which was FAR better. But really IOS you absolutely need to dump that terrible tasteless iceburg disaster and make the Greek salad standard!  Finally the gyro. The Manager came by and explained that IOS goes thru great pains to flavor the pressed lamb and beef mixture. It was good. But those of us at the table who have lived in Toronto, New York, Chicago, LA, Boston...etc...all said the \"amazing flavor\" wasn't. I must agree. Dont get me wrong it WAS good, just didnt match up to how it supposedly was prepared. Sorry. The kicker was that the serving portions were very small. Our standard sources of comparison are The Mad Greek and The Greek Isles on South Blvd.....both FAR better than IOS.  Overall.....good. Look they JUST opened so I'll give them a mulligan and come back and retry in the near future. But IOS just needs a few adjustments and they'll be a much better restaurant."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Cool bartenders/waitresses. Love to come here for the Greek salad with gyro meat; might be best in town. Would recommend to all."}
{"text":"To be clear, this review isn't about the food, because unfortunately, we didn't have the opportunity to eat here. I visited on March 7, and downtown was hopping! This restaurant, as well as all the others at EpiCenter were packed. We were seated almost immediately and the waitress came to our table about 5 minutes later. She took our drink and water orders and we ordered the calamari. Our waitress wasn't sure if there was any calamari left, but said she'd check and get back to us. Then we didn't hear from her for 10 minutes, when she reconfirmed our drink orders (read: ask for them again). Five minutes later she came back and said she had just placed our drink and appetizer order. After another 10 minutes (30 minutes total after having been seated), when we still didn't even have waters and noticed other disappointed diners ALL around us, we got up and left."}
{"text":"glad they closed... i saw that coming sheesh the food was gross and the menu was a joke i dont know what happened here because it was awesome when they were new, but they fell off drastically."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying I'm Greek and critical when it comes to Greek food. Born and raised in an all Greek family in 2 very Greek cities (Astoria, NY & Tarpon Spring, FL), I have a lot to compare to. The menu is not very traditional, but tried to be open minded. I had the Gyro with salad and both were good. Not the best I ever had, but definitely would stop through here again without hesitation. My girlfriend had the chicken souvlaki with the tzatziki sauce instead of the dressing. Tzatziki was not traditional, but not bad. Enjoyed the IOS Martini (Tito's Vodka, a little dirty, with Feta Cheese stuffed olives) - yum :) Compared to our other Charlotte Greek options, this place gets 3.5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Having been married to a Greek woman and having a number of close, Greek friends I'm partial to this cuisine. The service was a bit slow, the gyros pretty good. Overall decent for a yuppyish-type establishment. Curious enough to return the next time I'm in Charleston."}
{"text":"We stopped by for dinner on a quiet Sunday evening. The entrance was a bit confusing as there is not really a door, just garage doors that open into the center of the Epicentre. The table layout did not hint to the direction of the host stand so we just walked in and noticed the host stand hidden behind a wall.   I liked the interior and the inside/outside bar, gave the place a fun relaxed feel. After watching the calamari pass by my table, I figured I would give it a go. Glad I did, the calamari was fried perfectly with a bright acidic lemon sauce tossed with some red onion and peppers. I made a meal out of it.   I will be back to try the gyros and explore the menu a bit more."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Amazing food. I had the falafel pita and my wife had the lamb. The calamari app was better than I have had at other places in charlotte. Five stars."}
{"text":"I was staying near by and figure I would try IOS to take a break from BBQs.  Ordered their lamb pita with a side of Greek salad.  This I think it's the same as the lunch special mentioned by other reviewers.  The portion size I would say is actually like a normal Greek portion (not the crazy American size meals).  I have no issues with that tho it would seem \"small\" after seeing the standard American portions for so long.  Pita tasted ok, lamb tastes ok.  Did it tasted like what I thought a Greek lamb pita would taste like?  No.    Greek salad side?  Again tasted fine as far as being a salad goes.  Was it a Greek salad?  I would say no.   At least not in a traditional sense (there is lettuce in there, that's not a real Greek salad).    Growing up in Australia, we have a lot of Greek food around us.  This I would say is the Americanized version and not an impressive one either.  The lamb sausage was under seasoned, and the feta used in the salad was also surprisingly mild.  The saltiness of feta and sharp bite of onion that usually combines with sweetness in tomato was all together missing.  Perhaps other items on the menu is better, but I would give the pita combinations a miss.  The restaurant itself is in a very nice location and the open air bar area is nice to sit and drink at.  And service wasn't the fastest but the servers were very friendly and courteous.  Note: I decided to order the Greek crispy chicken wings to go (there were some good reviews on that)  Of the items I tried at IOS, this dish actually has the best flavor.  There is 10 pcs to the serve so for restaurant pricing, this is reasonable (still on the pricey side for wings but given the epicenter location I will let it go.  There was one fundamental flaw here - there are no wings at all!!  All drumlets only.  So incorrectly advertised."}
{"text":"$12+ for a Gyro Platter? Ok. I buy it and it has 3 items. Small Pita bread, a couple strips of Gyro meat, and crappy fries. Oh and a small thing of sauce. No onion, no tomato, no cheese, etc. Definitely the worse Gyro platter I have ever had. Not sure if I can get some authentic good Greek food here in Charlotte but trust me..........this ain't the place. Pass."}
{"text":"While in Charlotte, I checked out this Greek restaurant at the Epicenter. I was craving the calamari appetizer so I ordered it despite the $11 price tag on it. I should have remembered that calamari is often hit or miss. I was disappointed because, while the sauce was good, the actual calamari was so chewy and hard. It was like eating rubber, and for the price I paid, the amount was also a bit frugal. I did enjoy the gyro sandwich I had for $9.5 and it was a good filling size. A silver lining was the $1 PBR 16 oz. cans special that night, and the decor/ambiance isn't terrible for the restaurants price range. However, I wasn't that impressed for the price my husband and I paid -- I don't think I'll be going back again."}
{"text":"GOING OUT OF BUSINESS!  (Just google it) I have had previous experiences here - good food, ok/disappointing service.  Went a few weeks ago for lunch - menu is pretty much 8 items now. Menu isn't handed to you, but sits in table pop-up that typically holds special drinks/deserts or promos.  When asked, the waiter told us that they were 'making some menu changes' - come to find out after a quick google search, that they are on the verge of going out of business.  Then it all made sense - 8 items on the menu, 1 person in the kitchen, 1 waiter, 1 other table of patrons."}
{"text":"Had $1.50 tall boy PBRs, the hummus trio, a Greek salad, and gyro. Not a lot of lettuce in the salad but awesome feta. Delicious trip and gyro! Hip and modern decor that doesn't remind you of a cheesy Greek restaurant!"}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed. Went for lunch with my boss and peer. Entering the restaurant is confusing, you need to walk past tables or the bar to the find the hostess table. There were plenty of empty tables (odd for uptown during the noon hour). After we were seated, we weren't greeted by our waitress for several minutes. After placing both our drink and lunch orders, it took another several minutes to get our drinks. The food was not quick to be served, either. I had the falafel, it came with a salad. Both were fine but not anything I'd have a burning desire to come back for.   If there wasn't a wait for a table, I had ample time to dally and I really wanted (poor) table service, I'd go back if pressed. If I just wanted a good, quick falafel, I'd go to Pita Pit. Not exactly competition but the falafel is way better over there."}
{"text":"Great location!  Great service.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was good.  We ordered the calamari, spanakopita, and the meat sampler.  Everything was delicious!  We will be back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for drinks one afternoon over the holiday weekend.  The drinks from the new cocktail menu were fabulous, and the perch at the open bar was perfect for relaxing and watching the US Open.  Bobby, the manager, stopped to speak to us several times to make sure we were being taken care of.  Great staff and drinks! Can't wait to come back to try the food."}
{"text":"I made reservations a week in advance for a party of 8 for a Saturday night dinner. On the Saturday afternoon, I called to confirm the reservation. When we arrived, there were no other customers and our table wasn't ready! When we finally ordered drinks, it took another 30 minutes to get our cocktails. We asked to speak to the manager, and she was incredibly polite and told us our tab would be 50% off. We were instantly more happy with our sub-par service... until we got our bills. The waitress brought our checks at full price, and we had to tell her the manager was giving us a discount (by this point, there were 4 other customers at best, so there is no excuse for the waitress being out of the loop). Then, the waitress only comped us at 15%, so we had to talk to the manager AGAIN, at which point she told us that they were only going to discount us at 15% (our entire party clearly heard 50% off, so shame on the manager). I am thoroughly displeased with their customer service and would not recommend IOS to anyone."}
{"text":"I've given this place multiple opportunities, but I doubt I'll return at this point. For starters, this isn't \"real\" Greek food, and it's just OK, taste-wise. The atmosphere is nice, especially on a lovely day, and they have a nice liquor selection. However, the service and meal prep is really lacking, and it's overpriced. I recently ordered takeout, while I waited, and they tried to give me the wrong order. My order had apparently already been given to someone else who ordered takeout. On another occasion, I ordered the dip trio. At $8.50, I was surprised to see that I received hummus, carrot dip, and plain greek yogurt. The plain yogurt is obviously not the correct dip! Also, unless you ask for extra pita bread, you'll receive only 6 or so little squares to go with it- and the pita bread is just standard frozen delivery stuff."}
{"text":"This is the first time EVER where I walked out of a restaurant. Also want to say that I worked in a restaurant as a hostess and server for 5 years.   Came in at 2pm on a Sunday for lunch. Ordered a calamari appetizer and two gyros. After 20 mins later we asked for an update on the calamari since calamari really doesn't take that long. Server said it was gonna be another 5-10 mins. After another 15 mins later it was obvious it wasn't even close to being cooked. Kitchen was right in front of us and I can tell it was so chaotic. The expediter looked like he was so stressed out. There were 4 servers including the bartenders all running around. Still no appetizer. I look around and see 5 tables still waiting on food. We were there for 40 minutes and still no calamari and in between that time, only two tables got their food. Ridiculous. Everyone was waiting but they really wasn't that busy. Including the bar and the inside of the restaurant, it was maybe 80% full. Horrible management. We finally told the server that we were leaving and he apologized and said the kitchen was backed up. 40 minutes for an appetizer is crazy. I wanted to talk to the manager but he was so busy. I finally stopped a female server before we left and asked if he was the manager who was expediting and she said he was one of them. And I told her to tell him that it is crazy to wait so long for an appetizer. Her pathetic excuse was \"kitchen was backed up. Where were you sitting?\" That is a horrible excuse and what does it matter where we were sitting? She didn't care and she probably won't even tell the manager. But hopefully he reads it here. Never coming here again. They aren't even worth a second chance!!"}
{"text":"I was wonderfully surprised at 1:20 am that this place was still open AND serving! One of my biggest fears after a night out is that I am going to have to go to bed starving!   We were sat down immediately and told to stay as long as we'd like. Even better! Although they were out of their amazing Parmesan garlic chicken wings (bummer), it forced us to think outside of the box.   We ordered the pita nachos and the gyro sampler. Both were absolutely amazing but I must say the lamb was phenomenal! Very tender and well-seasoned, a must-try!  You're welcome."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink and app. before heading over to Time-Warner for a concert. The bar has sliding glass doors that open to the outside-giving it a relaxed/casual vacation feel. Unique Greek offerings-we had the grilled octopus and it was excellently  cooked.   We were introduced during the Charlotte Eats tour and sampled the gyros, Greek salad, and Greek fries. All were delicious!  Would give it 5 stars but the bartenders were a bit disorganized."}
{"text":"I would have chosen 0-stars if it was an option but 1-star is the lowest you can choose. The service was awful, with the waitress being very slow and incompetent. It is expensive for the quality and quantity of the food. My girlfriend ordered a wrap and I had the 3 meat plate. Both entrees were bland and the flavor that was in the food was not good. I would not eat here again if the meal was free!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with a coworker. Atmosphere is laid back, \"garage\" cool atmosphere. I ordered the lunch meat platter which came w a soda. The platter had grilled chicken, a ground beef kabob, pita, fries, and some salad. First I felt it was a little bit of a reach to call a dish that is more than half non meat a \"meat platter\", but in any case the chicken was tender and flavorful for what it was, and I thought the kabob was juicy and flavorful as well. The salad was very disappointing as it mostly iceberg lettuce and dressing. My coworker upgraded his side salad to a Greek salad and that was even worse - a dollar more for some feta crumbles and one cherry tomato. The fries and pita were unremarkable and did not add much to the dish. Service was friendly and efficient.   Overall the food here has only the faintest resemblance to authentic Greek food. I think this spot is much better utilized for a drink and people watching - it's right in the heart of the epicenter and should be busy on a warm evening."}
{"text":"So, there's some good (food), in a great location (epicenter), with medium to high prices for this kind of Greek food, with some room for growth in service and food offerings. More good that bad though...   I was fortunate enough to have been invited to an event at this new restaurant in epicenter. This is great venue with a terrific layout that made socializing easy! I was so very appreciative to have been invited and was floored that the restaurant closed their doors for us. Thank you Nikki and thank you IOS. Overall, the food was good but I have a little constructive criticism as the restaurant works on continuing to develop.   I really loved their chopped salad with their \"green goddess\" dressing along with a slice of the pita bread. Mouth watering good! I was disappointed to see a few things - the setup was done in a way where they only we're able to put out a little at a time, and it was all in a few small trays on a side table, which meant a very long wait to get to taste their yummy food. The wait could have been greatly alleviated with a larger set up - maybe something to keep in mind for the next time IOS does a large event. I was also sad to see they frequently ran out of dishes - seemingly just as I was about to get to try them (as I was queued up in line.) Additionallu, they \"ran out\" of hummus. Which, was just odd - considering its a staple food in any Mediterranean restaurant. Then, we looked over and noticed they were making to-go orders and had a large tub of what appeared to be hummus.  In their defense, I suspect they allowed a certain amount of food for the event and that amount had been used up. They likely had reserves because they were going to work in the kitchen on to go orders. Still it was disappointing to not get to have any when my 40 min wait was up in line.  Now, I was lucky enough to try a few bites of their main proteins - chicken and lamb for gyros. The chicken was good - clean white (not fatty or poorly trimmed) chicken breast. Now... The lamb, OH MY!!!! The lamb was juicy, moist, and incredibly well seasoned/marinated. It was great - I could really see myself going back for that along with the salad and green goddess dressing.  I would have liked to sample a more diverse menu with a larger offering - but what we tried (salad and proteins with pita) were good.  The general manager and sales manager also greeted our group and told us about IOS.  Here's the scoop:   IOS Is a new trendy Greek restaurant on the lower level of the epicenter. It just opened in May. It has a small footprint, but that still affords plenty of seating. They also have a nice full service bar. I cannot speak to their drinks, I went with diet soda during my visit.   They also offer takeout, delivery if you work or life nearby, ms if you're staying at the ALoft hotel, they bring you their dishes for room service. The epicenter has parking for at least $10, BUT (TIP!!!) if you go across the street it's half price parking.  I thought the food was good - overall. I thought their chopped Greek salad with green goddess dressing, and their lamb was indeed memorable. For the event, I would have liked to see a different layout - one that reduced waiting time, a more consistent flow and volume of food for the number in our group, and was sad when they ran out of meat as well as hummus.   Would I recommend IOS Greek kitchen, yes! I think it's a great new restaurant with a lot of potential.  I sincerely hope my honest review has helped some. And for those who haven't been here yet, give a try... Definitely worth a lunch trip or take out (or delivery if you're local).   Hope this review was useful to some."}
{"text":"Three of us ate here on Valentine's evening while we were on a Convention trip. Had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, but wow was it worth it.  The food was absolutely delicious. Every dish was amazing. Can't recommend this place too highly. A must try."}
{"text":"To avoid the pouring rain, we ran into this place to have a drink.  I got a dirty martini and my friend got some fruity drink.  I was unimpressed.  My martini glass was tiny and it was barely halfway full.  There was literally 2 spoonfuls of liquid in that tiny glass.  That would have been okay for $9 if I were surrounded by hot bodies in tight shirts dancing on white sofas.  In which case the goddamn drink woulda been free.  But this ain't Hollywood honey.  When I pay $9 for a drink I expect more than an eyedropper's worth."}
{"text":"Indoor/outdoor dining experience, with great location in Epicentre. Food was fresh and flavorful. Ordered the Hummus & Friends to start, the carrot purée was delicious and pita bread was so good I needed seconds. Salads with gyro meat were good sized portions for dinners. To top it off the staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"Blech....  The atmosphere of the place is pretty cool.  The drinks appeared to be interesting.  But the food Sucked!    We started out with the calamari. It was decidedly \"Meh\".  It was hard and chewy like it had been way overcooked. And the serving size was pretty small. The preparation sounded interesting but there was nothing interesting about it.  It's not something that I would ever order again.   Next came the Spicy Garlic Shrimp.  I like salty food but this was like unscrewing a salt shaker and putting it in my mouth.  It was inedible.  The \"grilled\" pita appeared to be deep fried and was rock hard.  Not appealing.    The last nausea inducing dish that we ordered was the Skewered Seasoned Lamb.  The description makes it sound like chunks of meat when it is actually ground lamb. Not a big deal.  But it was Way over seasoned like they were trying to cover up the flavor of sub par meat by dousing it with a mishmash of spices.   This is one of the very worst meals that I have had.  I literally felt so sick the rest of the evening that I had to call it an early night and go home.  I will never disrespect my stomach again by consuming this sorry excuse of Greek food."}
{"text":"2 stars seems so stingy.  I feel so bad.  Oh well...I'm over it.  My experience here was truly unimpressive.  The Epicenter is starting to get on my nerves because it just seems like the quality of food/service is suffering but that is just my observation.    We started with the trio dip which consisted of hummus, carrot puree and greek yogurt.  It was decent but both the hummus and carrot puree were bland and tasteless.  I could taste the garlic in the hummus but the portion was so small that I didn't really get a chance to enjoy it.  The fried pita chips were interesting and tasty although I'm actually glad they only gave us 6 because those things could be a hazard to your hips!    I ordered the traditional greek salad and traditional it was not.  There were 3 pieces of lettuce.  Count 'em..I,2,3.  That's right....3 pieces of lettuce in a salad.  It was primarily tomatoes and feta.  There were a few onions and I added chicken.  Parts of the chicken were not cooked through.  The salad was small and it was basically like bruchetta.  Not a fan.    Others ordered the wedge salad which was challenging to eat because of the big wedge of lettuce on the plate and everything else sliding off the plate.  And one person ordered the chicken pita with fries and some other side.  No one was impressed.  We all left unsatisfied and felt that we overpaid.  I was very disappointed.  The food took forever to come out and we were the only ones in the entire restaurant.  The service was fine but the whole experience was just not good.  Sorry IOS...not for me."}
{"text":"Nestled into the bowels of the Epicentre in downtown Charlotte, IOS has created a trendy spot with open air and space for diners with a taste for modern Greek cuisine.  You really gotta love a place where you can sit and eat inside the restaurant, but still be outdoors - so the location and ambiance of this place is on point!  Ate here for lunch and had the spicy lamb pita with fries.  I am a big fan of obscenely salted fries, and let me tell you, these are up there with the best of the options that fit that criteria.  My lamb pita was also pretty good, although I have to say that presentation was a bit unappetizing.  It honestly looked like the lamb had been rolled into a hot dog, making it appear a bit... inappropriate for those of us with the maturity level of a 12 year old.    The big drawback to my experience, unfortunately, was the poor service.  No one greeted me as I walked in.  I sat down after confirming with someone behind the bar that it was okay to do so, and even then, no one acknowledged me.  Waited a good 5 minutes for the server to come around the first time, and then, despite a restaurant I would estimate (based on the empty tables) as being about 20%-30% full, my lunch took over 30 minutes to come out.  The food was good, and I will gladly wait a little longer for good food, but for a pita and fries during a lunch rush on a weekday?  it's a bit of an issue for us busy folks who have to go back and sleep during our afternoon meetings."}
{"text":"My friend and I came and tried this new joint at EpiCentre last Thursday at the end of AA5, and I was pleasantly surprised.   First, I like the set up and the decor. We sat at the bar, which is half inside and half outside (we were at the \"outside\" part of it). It's nice, low key & causal, and that's a breath of fresh air for EpiCentre. We sure do not need another snotty \"lounge.\"  It's funny that we looked out and up and we're bathed in the neon light of CVS Pharmacy & Gold's Gym.   Second, I was happy to see that the prices of the menu weren't too crazy. I ordered a lamb pita sandwich (with a choice of salad or fried) for $9. My friend loves calamari, and her fried calamari was of good size and $11. They had a drink special for $3. We walked out $13 each, which isn't bad for uptown.  Lastly, the food quality was great. My lamb was well seasoned and juicy. The calamari was fried just right, not over done, not too chewy, and has a great seasoning as well.  Service was good, our bartender was attentive, and he interacted with us (gasp, he actually talked to his patrons!).   It was an overall great experience, and now all I ask for is to keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Our waitress really let down the side here in a huge way. While the food was great, it was very apparent when we were waiting 25 minutes between our starter and our mains that she'd forgotten to put in the second part of our order. And then we were waiting and waiting to catch her eye to get a check. It's not that big a restaurant, but she spent at least five minutes with her back to us watching the bartender making drinks and there was no one else we could get for her attention.  We had the parmesan fries to start and they were excellent. Crispy, hot, fresh and lots of parmesan on there. Big portion.  For mains, I had the falafel wrap with a greek salad. Tasty and delicious, the wrap had all the right stuff in there and the salad was much more \"stuff\" and very little lettuce. Very good. My daughter had the crispy chicken wing starter, but as her main. She enjoyed it - they came out very hot and very crispy. Nice.  But wow, the service."}
{"text":"Had lunch here and Gyro was delicious. It was so good that I could have eaten 2 sandwiches. Anyway, I loved it and the side salad was perfect as well.   I ate some of my friends french fries and it was ok - needed more salt and just flavor, but definitely edible.   The decor is nice, fast table service, and friendly. If you are in the mood for Greek food and are in this location, I would definitely recommend trying this place. I was pleasantly surprised and glad we came.   I am still a little hungry so the portion sizes could always get bigger :)"}
