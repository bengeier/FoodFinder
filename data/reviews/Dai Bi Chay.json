{"text":"Great place to get vegan/vegetarian Pho. They also got mock meats which taste exactly like real meat. Kathy the owner is super nice."}
{"text":"Been here many times since it opened, everything is always well made and tasty. Bonus points go to being one of the only veggie Pho places in the GTA. 

They have very reasonable prices, and everything is good that they have on the menu. I have had most of it. Their take out section is nice too.

Owners here are super friendly and care about their craft a lot. Very happy this is in Sauga :)"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious here and they always give more than you think. It's not expensive at all by any means, and you don't feel heavy at all after your meal. The only thing is, it's kind of self serve when it comes to utensils and such things (which doesn't bother me at all), but if your picky you may not like it. You have to write down what you want on a paper pad, and the forks, chopsticks, and spoons are in some sort of holder. The people here are also very nice."}
{"text":"Wow is all I can say. This place is all about the taste, and quality. Agree with other reviews that the pho soup is the best I've ever had. 
Friendly service in a relaxed atmosphere.... did I mention how good the food was?
Excellent"}
{"text":"My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed the platter which had the vegetarian version of bo la lot (grilled beef in betel leaves), chao tom (shrimp sausage grilled on sugar cane), and bo nuong (grilled beef). The chao tom was our fave. Their mock mam nem was exceptional."}
{"text":"I've been trying to convert to being pescetarian so I've discovered this place driving along Mississauga with my mom and aunt. Very peaceful and welcoming atmosphere. Super clean and open. There's a beautiful alter in the corner along with dvds about buddism and donations, great place! The food is just as good. Before even taking a seat, we were given a little snack of sticky rice with mock pork. 


The server was really super nice and very attentive to us.  We ordered a mango salad, chow mein with veggies and I ordered vegetarian bun rieu. My bun rieu had tomatoes, mushrooms, tofu, mock sausage, and a side of bean sprouts and cabbages. When something was wrong with our food, they brought it back with many concern and fixed it for us. Again the food was delicious, would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"I ordered rice with mock pork and chicken, so flavourful! Usually at Vietnamese restaurants, I find myself dipping everything with nuoc mam (fish sauce). This was not the case, for this particular restaurant. The food is so flavourful, that it doesn't need to be paired with sauces! The restaurant is so clean, and the customer service was fantastic. If you're a vegetarian or vegan, and love Vietnamese food, definitely give this restaurant a try! So yummy!"}
{"text":"A great find in an industrial road. Can't beat these prices for delicious vegetarian food! First time here and I was very impressed. The atmosphere and staff were wonderful. Will be coming back very soon!"}
{"text":"What made this visit memorable was the service and people willing to help and answer questions clearly. Which was very reassuring. Even though food was 3.5 or. 4 star, the service earned them extra stars!

You can tell that I am so ignorant - I always assumed the Vietnamese food always had some fish or meat in it and it was impossible to get Vietnamese Vegetarian food. I was made aware of this place and was not sure if I should try even after I glanced through the menu online. 

So on Friday night after a long tiring day, the four of us headed to try DBC out. You are given menus and an order book with a pen. We went through the extensive menu and wrote our choices. Served hot green tea as well. 

We ordered a W01 a plate with salads and mock meats and more salad and surprise a bunch of rice paper rolls (which we failed to notice that it comes with this). More Rice paper was offered if needed for no extra charges. It says that it is for 2 people but 3 people can easily eat it. If you do not know how to wrap rice paper rolls, do not attempt this as it takes some practice to do it. The servers are very helpful and will also teach you if needed. Luckily for me Mrs has made this several times at home and it was breeze for her. For me, not so much. Do get the peanut satay sauce as the standard sauce provided was not as good. 

Ordered a S04 which was fried and rice and stir fried mock beef. Which was standard and and not as flavourful as expected. 

Ordered a N11 which was a vermicelli Soup in a spicy broth. The Soup was spicy and good. Do try to finish as soon as you can as when cool it is not as good. 

Also ordered a steamed rice with stir Fried vegetables and some mock meats. Which was great as well."}
{"text":"I don't like downgrading my reviews and while I still really like this place, a few things have changed since my initial visit last year.  

1.  The food has gotten greasier.  When you order any of the broths, you can see a layer of oil/grease and while that's great for taste, it's not the healthiest.  If you order any of the non-broth dishes, like rice or stir fried noodles, you see the grease at the bottom of the plate.

2. The prices have increased slightly and I'm not upset about that.  In today's economy and the min. wage increasing, I understand businesses have to increase their prices to sustain a living. However, what they also did was cut back on the pieces of \"mock meat\".  Before they would give 5-6 pieces of mock meat in their pho and now it's only two.  

Verdict: I'll still be back since it's on my way home from work but it's not the same value as it was before."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD.  
We took an entire family here for dinner (from 3 month old to 65 year old), and everyone enjoyed the food.  The mock meat was incredible, and full of flavour.
There are lots of options to eat, and this is now my go to spot for a quick fix of vietnamese food...  
Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Finally got over here, on a weekend I was feeling sick = perfect!

Been craving Bun Bo Hue since watching my uncle eat a traditional beef one in SF a few weeks ago. So was excited to see it on the menu, also grabbed some shredded mock pork rolls and the BF got the pad thai with \"beef\". 

Growing up in a Buddhist family, we went for vegetarian food about a dozen times a year so I was versed with the variety of mock meat there is out there. The BF is still getting used to the texture and taste. 

The rolls were good, no sauce was provided though so wasn't as good as it could be.

The Bun Bo Hue was pretty good, the ratio of protein to noodles were great but no veggies. Asked about it after I saw it on another table on the way to paying, they had forgotten it. Good to know for my next time there!

BF's pad thai was meh...way too much noodles and not enough veggies/tofu. He enjoyed the flavor at first but then near the end he said it was too sweet and over powering. 

Grabbed some 'pork belly' on the way out to go, lunches this week have been delicious ^_^

Service was strained, under staffed for sure but nice enough. Will be back to try all their other menu items!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! I am so happy I found this place. The location is very unexpected, looks like a bit of a hole in the wall but as you know that's often where the best food can be found. This is no exception. We came here on a Friday night, it had a few other people, pretty steady business. We were seated quickly and you write your order on the paper, the food came out so quickly. We also ordered one item from the buffet style counter that wasn't on the menu (BBQ mock pork - see photo). We had the wonton soup, crispy veggie noodles, and spring rolls. The wonton soup was the BEST soup I have had in so long, I cannot emphasize this enough! Get. The. Soup! (If you like cilantro) the broth was sweet and so flavourful, the wontons were crispy, ugh spectacular. I even enjoyed the spring rolls and I rarely eat spring rolls. The noodles were super tasty and the mock pork was unreal, seriously how did they do that?!  My non veggie boyfriend even agrees that this place is a must try.

Thank you for bringing me a veggie friendly version of Vietnamese cuisine, I think I am in love!"}
{"text":"This place is so underrated! One of the best vegetarian restaurants I've ever been to. 

The prices are such a deal for the amount of food you're getting.
Furthermore, the food tastes exactly like meat. I was tempted to ask the waitress if the fish cakes were actually vegetarian, it tastes exactly like I remember fish cakes to taste. 
My meat eating friend said this was the best pho that she has ever had!

I recommend getting the bahn mi sandwiches, they were so tasty. 
Definitely will be coming back here again, I will be recommending it to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Family owned vegetarian restaurant located in Mississauga. We went on Chinese New Year and it was not very busy when we arrived for 6:30pm. Their food was delicious. From the fresh spring roll, to mango and papaya salad, everything was fresh and flavoured well. For mains, their noodle soups were very popular. From their clear glass noddles to pad Thai, everything was cooked well. Their mock meats were also seasoned well and grilled. Delicious!
My only feedback would be for their service. There is room to improve on being more attentive. Removing dishes, filling up your tea and asking if everything is okay would be good first steps. However I recognize that it did get more busy closer to 7pm. Overall a great vegetarian option!"}
{"text":"Went to Dai Bi Chay yesterday with my partner after work. Super convenient location for me, as I work around the corner, and we've been meaning to find a plant based, cheap, Vietnamese restaurant! The food was GREAT. I got a noodle soup (number N03 I think) and he got an egg noodle soup with faux meat (N07 I think). We shared a plate of spring rolls and a strawberry shake. It was all awesome! I do have to say that I'm not used to having a non-bone broth in my noodle soups, but this broth was fresh and equally full of flavorful. The spring rolls .... LOVED THEM. Bite size and PACKED with filling. The spicy plum sauce was great too! I have to say, having fake meat in my food was an experience for me, as I haven't had meat in 6-7 years, and it went so nicely with my soup. We are definitely coming back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! 

Kind and quick service, very clean space, and a ton of excellent food options. 

I've tried most of their menu over the past few months, and am obsessed. I lived in Asia for the past four years, and their mock meat fried rice is the only vegan version I've found that is at least as good as the eggy street shack original. The spicy Hue noodle soup is absolutely excellent, and their BBQ pork banh mi is a steal at around $3 (add sriracha!). I would only recommend skipping the mock meat summer rolls. 

This place is also an ideal food stop on the way home. They have a ton of prepared food options at the counter, and prepare their to-go orders quickly.

I wish this place were located in Toronto, because the food quality is so much better than every Asian spot in the city. They aren't super busy and wait times are incredibly reasonable, I really hope they stick around because I would miss this food way too much."}
{"text":"Being a vegetarian pho joint, this could be the best Pho I ever had. Not to mention it not leaving you bloating and disgusting feeling afterwards. The options are not the greatest, and the one thing I really want on the menu they never have...but everything from Pho, to Apps, to Rice Dishes have been more than excellent.

The service is super friendly and fair. When their debit wasn't working they gave me my food for free. And I've tried almost everything on menu and the ONE time I didn't enjoy something, she replaced the dish and went to the chef to figure out why it wasn't right."}
{"text":"I was sorta in the area, previewing a house for a client, when I Yelped a place to eat and came across this Vegetarian Vietnamese restaurant.  It's located on an Industrial strip on Cawthra, just North of the Queensway.

Interior of the restaurant looks renovated and welcoming, despite the weird location.

Atmosphere is casual.  My friend & I literally just helped ourselves to the menu and sat ourselves.  So don't expect a greeting, to be seated or acknowledged right away.  Laidback is how they roll.

5/5 - For uniqueness as I don't know of any other Veg Vietnamese places in the city or even GTA.  Even if you ask for no meat at pho places, the broth itself is still made out of beef bones.

3.5-4/5 - For the dish that I had, N03.  I don't know the name, but it was some kinda pho noodle soup with mock meat.  Soup did taste different from your usual pho place, so keep that in mind.  I don't believe that there was MSG in it, but it was still very tasty.  This is probably an unfair comparison because it's not the same type of cuisine, but the food still wasn't as good as Lotus Tea House, vegetarian as well.  My friend enjoyed her Bun Bo (beef) Hue...without the bo, but I never had a chance to try it.

Prices were on-par/slightly lower than most pho places.  Both noodles dishes that were ordered were $7.50ea, Banh Mi was $3, Rice dishes were around $8, Avocado Shake/Viet Coffee was $4."}
{"text":"Only came here last week for my vegan friend, so my expectations were quite low. Admittedly, I was pretty apprehensive when I heard about the mock meat. 

I'm happy to say that this place went above and beyond what I was expecting. The mock meat was flavored really nicely and had the right texture to ensure it mimics the real thing. 

I had ordered the bun thit nuong. The spring rolls were really crispy and warm. The mock meat seemed to have sear marks to mimic the grilled pork. It was also seasoned well and very flavorful.

I definitely would not mind coming back to try other items on the menu. My only complaint would probably be how unfulfilling some of the dishes that were ordered, such as the pan fried noodles."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Dai Bi Chay. We're not vegetarian, but decided to give it a try because of the great Yelp reviews. 

The decor is fairly standard for a Vietnamese restaurant. It's a medium-sized dining room with 14 tables (some for 8 guests) and seems clean and tidy. 

We ordered the veggie spring rolls, which were tiny compared to usual vietnamese restaurants. There were 5 of them, but they were in a wheat wrapper instead of the traditional rice wrapper. They tasted quite good, but nothing special. They were served with a thick sweet chilli sauce instead of the traditional fish sauce (understandable as it's a vegetarian restaurant). 

We also had the mango salad which wasn't bad. It had some sort of faux meat in it (not needed) and definitely needed some spice. We added sambal oelek which helped. 

Lastly, we had the Hu style soup which had several meat substitutes in a fairly bland broth. It wasn't bad but other than being a bit spicy, there wasn't a ton of flavour. The noodles were cooked well, though. 

The service was quick and friendly. 

All in all, it was a pretty good experience. If you're vegetarian and craving Vietnamese food with mock meat to replace the real thing, this is a good option."}
{"text":"Food was ok but the service was too slow.
I finished eating, went down stair to go washroom and saw their staff making some food right cross to the washroom. It looked not clean and not very nice.... sorry I won't come back!"}
{"text":"I am a fan! If you're looking for Vietnamese food that's fresh, vegan, healthy and tasty, then this place is right for you. There was a wide variety of vegetarian selections (which I liked), place was extremely clean, staff was friendly and accommodating. Overall experience was 10/10. I'd definitely come back again.
Only negative note: it was cash only."}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian food. One of the best in GTA. Fantastic Vietnamese flavour. They have all the Vietnamese dishes I could think of, and have a great hot pot for two. So glad we found this place."}
{"text":"Saw an ad in a newspaper about a vegetarian Vietnamese place and decided to give it a try after seeing the good reviews on Yelp. It was quite a far drive but it was well worth it because I've found a new favourite spot! 

I have dietary preferences so vegetarian food is always a safe choice for me. Having always wanting to try certain Vietnamese dishes but not being able to because of the ingredients was always a challenge. I was excited to try out the different dish options that were all offered with mock meat. We ordered some fried spring rolls along with mock sausage skewers (which were AMAZING. chewy and marinated just right). The spring rolls were also amazing and weren't too oily. 

I ordered the Vegetarian Nam Vang style rice noodle soup which was a clear soup base filled with mock meat of different types. Their portion sizes are pretty big for your average noodle bowl so it was definitely good value. 

I was very impressed with this hole in the wall and as I mentioned earlier, it will be a new go-to place of mine. For those who are not partial to mock meat, I highly recommend giving this place a try because you will not be disappointed. Definitely will be coming back!"}
