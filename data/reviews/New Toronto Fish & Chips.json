{"text":"I have been here about 5 times and it is consistently good. The fries are incredible and the fish is everything you would expect. My only con is the lack of a lemon wedge with your fish. I think that should be mandatory with fish and chips (they may offer it but I always forget to ask) . I often come here just for a small order of chips. They are always good and the price is quite reasonable. The place is quite run down but I think it adds to its charm in a weird kind of way."}
{"text":"Really tasty halibut and chips! Eat in if you can since the crispiness of the meal is key. So the d√©cor isn't modern, get over it! The portion sizes are large but you can halve the fries if it's too much. Their hours didn't have late eaters in mind so go early!"}
{"text":"My visit was for take out at 6:30pm, height of Monday dinner time.    Visit Again?: Yes, but only because of proximity  Party Size: 1  I didn't mind the retro squalor, some might.  It seems halibut is their feature fish, as there are ads for its nutritional value and posters for Alaskan Halibut posted prominently.  Adding to their credibility is a review from the Toronto Star (though from 2004.)  I had the haddock & chips.  I wanted to have the experience suggested in the review from 2004,  but I wasn't that impressed. The chips were sort of warm when I got them home (something I thought about when I saw him ladling them from the chip shelf instead of fresh from the deep fryer...guess he was saving those for someone else.)  The haddock was good, the batter could have coated the fish more consistently, however what was there was crispy. I ate it all, despite disappointing chips.    More on those chips. The chips lost them a star here.  Is there anything less palatable than a tired, not hot enough, greasy chip? And they could have been thicker cut for my preference, in keeping with the English tradition.    I liked how they wrapped the fish & chips.  Not newsprint, but newsprint paper - echoes of England and the fish & chips of my youth.  It wouldn't take much to get this place up to a higher standard, but sorry to say my 1st visit was not great.  Also not impressed by the client coughing on and handling the ketchup packets at the front desk, though not the proprietors fault. Seedy as heck from the outside, but I liked that. Pull your socks up guys, you could be great!"}
{"text":"I got the halibut for take out. When I got home the fries were pretty soggy. The batter on the fish wasn't great, but the fish was excellent. Nice big piece as the batter was very thin on it.  I have no complaints however it didn't blow me away. I had a craving for fish and chips and this place satisfied it."}
{"text":"Definitely an eat in spot unless you like soggy fish n chips. Eat in and get nice fast service at this old school greasy spot.  The decor and seating is really dated but the food is pretty good.  Try the onion rings as they are delish but really heavy."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but there were problems.   Pros- Fish and batter were good. Price was very good.  Cons- Chips were crappy (yes they are hand cut but that doesn't make them good) and customer service was bad bad bad. Granted I did go in 20 minutes to close, HOWEVER, I noticed that that was the case and very politely asked if it was still ok to get take out and he said yes for sure. So, when my food was ready the guy tossed in on the counter and didn't say a word to me, I found it really rude. Lastly, I got home and realized there was no tartar sauce put in the bad nor was I asked if I wanted any... come on! It's fish and chips!  Wish it was good because of the price point but I will not be back."}
{"text":"One of the best Fish & Chip places in Toronto. The interior looks like an old greasy spoon but I always get takeout."}
{"text":"We've been coming here since 2007. It is consistent, well priced, and always friendly. We love their coleslaw. Their fish has always been plump and fresh. The batter is consistently tasty. The fries are sometimes a miss, though when they are a hit - 75% of the time, they are great. I also like their onion rings. I would recommend it. It is a heavy meal - let's be clear, greasy and heavy, though you don't leave like you're carrying bricks in your belly. You just feel full."}
{"text":"The best fish & chips in th area. Melts in the mouth, and a far cry better than the new Halibut House. Wrapped in paper, as it should be."}
{"text":"Best fish & chips in Toronto ! Good service great food - fish is always perfect and the fries are amazing ! My go to in the GTA hands down"}
{"text":"BEST in Toronto...  and New Toronto!!!"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner on Christmas Eve. The halibut had a thin coating of batter (mostly fish)!  The chips were hand cut and very good. Loved the cole slaw.  The retro decor is interesting."}
{"text":"Great fish and very friendly and efficient. Great mom and pop operation. Excellent halibut. My only criticism is the fries. They are a bit soggy and get worse when you get them home (we live 3 blocks away). Otherwise their fish is superb. We have a cat that  NEVER eats people food and he loves it too."}
{"text":"Delicious fish & chips at a very reasonable price! Portions are a good size, especially the amount of chips."}
{"text":"No frills- just juicy fresh fish, deep fried in a crispy batter, served with a heep of fries.   They know what they are good at and stick to it. Went with the haddock, halibut with chips and coleslaw. Halibut was very tasty. Not over cooked, fish was moist but not greasy. Menubis no nonsense.   The ambience is dated, but it has this certain charm to it. Staff are truly a gem here. Greet you with a warm welcome and more then willing to chat you up."}
{"text":"This place couldn't more like what it's called. Feels like the kinda place that's been there forever and 100% fits the vibe of the hood... Like, doesn't even bother trying to be obviously a restaurant when you walk by, hours are odd and unclear, and it may be older than religion.   But it's exactly the fish and chips you imagine. Down to the paper wrapping and the right vinegar and matching slaw. Even my toddler points for it when we walk by now.   So good. Such nice people. Totally worth the calories."}
{"text":"This place is like Penrose in the north end. Authentic British style fish and chips. Great fries and best onion rings anywhere. Run by a really nice family. It's been here since 1973. Eating in is like riding in a time machine."}
{"text":"Ordinarily I'm not big on fish, I need to be in a particular mood to enjoy it and it needs to be cooked a certain way. My fish and chips need to be cooked a certain way too and this place is AMAZING. It is hands down my favourite place in Toronto for fish and chips. The food is always fresh and hot and absolutely delicious.   A bit pricey at times but they have regular deals that you can take advantage of."}
{"text":"Best fish & chips!  I always order the halibut & am never dissappointed.  Fish is always fresh.  Have been coming here for the past three decades.  The decor is ...well, what decor?  But not there for that!  The batter is delicious!  The fries are hand cut & never frozen.  I have recently switched to onion rings from fries and they are hand dipped & fried fresh. Best to eat freshly fried & not as take out.  This is the standard to which all other fish & chips are judged!!!"}
{"text":"Very good fish and chips! We often have them on christmas eve-day because historically they have been open on December 24th. Usually do takeout - it takes some time to wait for everything to be cooked / fried, but it's good."}
