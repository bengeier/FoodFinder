{"text":"Never again.    Much better offerings in the Junction/ High Park vicinity."}
{"text":"I love Indian food for its bold flavours and textures, but that is not something you will find here. If you are looking for an Indian food restaurant that tones it down on flavour, then this is your place ... Easily the most bland Indian food I have ever tasted. Sauces are much to watery/runny too ... never again.  Update: Apparently, someone from the the restaurant has called BS on this review...  See response below this review... Guess one person's opinion is meaningless if ownership disagrees with it. That's fine. But, I assure you, Amar S., I do not work for your competition. I am simply a customer that was very disappointed in your product."}
{"text":"Not what it claims to be. I tried the place for the first time today. I ordered a Biryani, Raita and a Lassi. The biryani was tasty but not biryani by any stretch of the imagination. The chicken was chunks of chicken Tikka and the rice had green peppers, peas and sweet corn in it. The Lassi was watery and yucky. And it's hard to mess up yogurt and cucumber- so the raita was fine. The staff is friendly and the decor is nice, but I prefer the Curry Twist in the Junction Area. However today I found out they do not serve Biryani :("}
{"text":"The onion baji is to die for, especially with the coriander dipping sauce!"}
{"text":"I have to say that this is one Indian Restaurant that does not smell like it's an Indian Restaurant if you all know what I mean by this.......  I loved it from the first time I went for dinner back in 2006 and have gone back over and over again. Reason being there are very consistent and every item on the Menu is VERY GOOD.  The non Indian Service people don't seem too happy to be waiting tables there, however there are good at being waitstaff.   So next time you are in the Junction go & check out North of Bombay and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's a surprise how this place stays open because every time I've been here there barely been 3 tables seated. Regardless, the food is tasty, prices reasonable. Staff can be a little inattentive at times and food service times a little slow sometimes but overall I had a good experience dining here. Again, I was here with a large group and they were happy to accommodate us. The  MULLIGATAWNY LENTIL SOUP for only $3.95 with some naan is actually a great little meal and the MALAI  KOFTA is yumyum."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant. I only ever have them deliver but the food is always amazing and so consistent. Its never had a off day. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Just ordered some delivery through just-eat from here. Food was really good, and the portions were really big! The food took a while to come (1.5 hours after order), but it was piping hot, and delivery guy was really nice. Would order again!"}
{"text":"Excellent and great ambience and service.  The decor was simple and typical of Indian restaurants. The waitstaff was friendly and was happy to explain in details about the dishes and offered recommendations.  I also liked that the food was not overly salty.  The Junction had many great restaurants and this is one of them.  The garlic naan bread and the eggplant stew was so good that I had to remind myself to keep up with my table manners..."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery via justeat app. Arrived on time (45 mins).  Pricing was typical.  Food was below average.  Butter Chicken 5/10 - tastes like watery tomato soup. Curry Chicken 3/10. Curry was very watery and when served there was literally a puddle of water on the plate. Garlic naan 1/10.  Worst naan I've ever had from a Indian restaurant. Tastes like reheated frozen flatbread with some garlic.  Won't be ordering from here again.  Curry Twist which is literally 2 doors down is way better but they don't deliver via justeat.ca."}
{"text":"I went in with great expectation, but it was a big let down . If you are a fan of authentic Indian food avoid this restaurant .I ordered lamb briyani , rice was sticky and it had peas  kidney beans ,tomato . Take risk at your own cost. It is pricy too."}
{"text":"Do NOT order from this restaurant.  Food took an inexcusable 1 hour and 50 minutes to arrive.  That's almost two hours folks! Completely ruined the evening - everyone was beyond starving.  Food was bland and mediocre at best - it has gone seriously downhill since last we ordered.  The final insult:   the manager who delivered the food offered a paltry $10 off a $150 food order that took two hours to deliver.  Never again."}
{"text":"THE BEST Indian restaurant in the Bloor West / Junction area. Period.   Anyone complaining about bland food probably did not understand the question of the waitress (how spicy would you like your food?). One of the many things I like about this restaurant is the fact that they let you customize the spice level (I have my dishes mild, my wife hot/spicy)... the food is prepared FRESH. Otherwise they would not let you customize like many other Indian restaurants (buffets are the worst ...)... Anyone complaining about the fact that this restaurant is not smelling like an Indian restaurant\" has been to too many bad Indian restaurants ... the fact that the owner invested money in a proper ventilation system means I don't have to wash my clothes after visiting (unlike many other Indian restaurants). I have been a frequent visitor of this restaurant for many years and I have tried almost all of their chicken dishes and I can say they are all DELICIOUS !!"}
{"text":"We had to wait over 90 min. for delivery and when we called to complain there was no apology.  Food was good, customer service was not."}
{"text":"I tried this place off just-eat, the butter chicken is sooooooo good with the garlic naan bread. I would definetly order from here again."}
{"text":"If it weren't for a lot of last-minute RSVP's, my friend would've ended up having her birthday dinner over at Curry Twist on Friday night.  But it wasn't meant to be, and I for one, am glad. This place is great!  Appearance-wise, the space is huge! Lots of seating. I'm actually surprised that, for a Friday night, it wasn't busier. It was just our huge group and a couple of women closer to the front of the restaurant.   I ordered the 3-piece Papadum to start. Just the right amount of crispy and salty at once.   The lamb curry that followed was great - but could've been warmer temperature-wise. (That was probably because the curry and papadum arrived at the same time - minor quibble.) And I should've ordered more naan to sop up that yummy sauce. So good, and such a shame to waste it!  Even if you're a non-Junctionite, it's worth the trip - it gets a thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, the food is of good quality, even though it is slightly overpriced. However, I'll have to forgo my favourite Indian in the city, because since I have moved, apparently 3.8 kms is too far for delivery, and out of your delivery area? North of Bombay won't venture to Queen and Brock, Really.... 3.8 kms is too far for DELIVERY? That's ridiculous."}
{"text":"I love coming to this restaurant. I love their food.  Service is great! Warmest you will ever cross! I am referring to their hostess! Sorry lady! I forgot your name.  Food is great! Mostly :P!! I love their Butter chicken Special! Chicken Tikka Masala! Malai Kofta (OMG!!)  But please don't order Biryani ! Its very -very bad!! (I have to be honest here!)  Their decor is simple yet very nice. They generally play light Indian music which is soothing to my ears. Also if you are lucky..try to sit in their semi Patio! You will love it..."}
{"text":"I have to admit, the food here is the best.  Their food is not oily like other Indian restaurants and I find the food very flavorful. I have had the aloo vindaloo, matar paneer, paneer makhani, chappati, chat papri, channa masala, samosas, and the kulfi. All were pretty good. Some of this food I ordered for delivery and the service is friendly and quick. The decor is nice inside. It looks like a place you can bring a date."}
{"text":"Definitely not the best Indian food around. If you like it Canadianized sure but no thnx..."}
{"text":"The food here is decent but nothing to get excited about. It's lucky that there isn't good competition for Indian food in the area so they're ahead in the Junction for now. One thing I will give them, while the butter chicken was a bit bland, it tasted better than most but still not far above average. Their quality of meat, inc beef, is excellent though, very soft and moist. I don't know what's up with the naan, was more like a chapati! we ordered the garlic naan, but still was too \"roti-like\""}
{"text":"We have ordered from North of Bombay at least 5 times. Usually it was okay, maybe a little bland, not complex. Also not expensive and reasonably fast. This time it was dreadful. Every dish was watery. Channa Masala medium was wet. Literally wet, as in when you put it on the flavourless basmatic rice, there was a pool of water. It was also bland and we'd ordered medium.  Beef curry had no vegetables. Usually has some onion or something. Beef was quite dry in the middle and was in a very thin sauce. We picked the beef out and sawed the chunks up with a knife to eat them rather than chewing and chewing. Then threw out the container which as full of a sauce that was soupy and thin. Mr. Patak's sauce would have improved it. Palak paneer was basically pureed spinach, cooked long enough to displace any flavour or texture. Very few cubes of cheese. We counted eight. Threw most of that out too. Could also have used salt. Aloo gobi was a welcome change. It was dry, and tough! Cauliflower not cooked enough and was more rubbed with spice, couldn't distinguish which ones, so also a disappointment. Naan was okay. What can you do to charred bread? Don't know if we blew it by not adding the tip to our debit bill (we tipped in cash later although I always wonder what I'm tipping for on take out since none of the money makes it to back of house where all the work is done), and that earned us bad food. Or if they were just having a terribly off night.  We won't be going back. $65 on virtually inedible food and an unfriendly attitude on the part of staff too."}
{"text":"Never a disappointment.  Food is very good, and service excellent.  We always come with friends and have a good time.  I don't remember what we ordered because they always know what to order.  Four dishes, rice and naan is plenty and take home packages."}
{"text":"Pretty good traditional Indian. Nothing 'wow' though. I have to say I'm now a bigger fan of Curry Twist. But this is my 2nd go-to for Indian in the 'hood."}
{"text":"Very tasty dishes for those who can't take hot spicy foods but still appreciate Indian Food flavours. Friendly service and good ambience (very quiet atmosphere)."}
{"text":"This was our first time ordering here. We really wanted to have some Lamb Biryani, but they didn't have it. They had Beef Biryani, and it was the weirdest biryani we've ever had. They had grape-tomato, corn, and green pepper slices in it. Never had such a Biryani dish and we didn't like it. Their bread and the Lamb Curry was fantastic, though. I don't care for the restaurant layout or the decoration, seems outdated and planned for maximum occupancy. The girl - only one working there - was nice. Their takeout didn't come with any cutlery and/or napkins, and although no one asked, they should have included it. They also deliver, but we wont be ordering their biryani again."}
{"text":"When I walk into an Indian restaurant, I want to spell the pungent odour of fried spices.  However, this place smelled like the inside of an art museum - I'm not kidding!  The decor was nice, a sort of Regency/Indian mix.  The servers were pleasant though none were South Asian.  The menu is fairly short and as per its name, consists of North Indian offerings.  We found the food to be too bland and too \"adopted\" for mainstream tastes, perhaps.  We both ordered chicken.  Vindaloo was okay, but too many potatos in relation to the chicken, sauce too tomatoey and not searing hot and sour as vindaloo should be.  Tikkas masala had more chicken but needed a bit creamier sauce with more distinctive spicing.   A side of raita was well flavoured but too salty.  I'd stick with High Park Spicy house down the street.  Funkier, more genuine, and much better food."}
{"text":"Have been eating NB food for over 15 yrs - eat in/ delivery and have enjoyed it a lot! Their samosas (veggie) are among the best, BUT their garlic naan leaves something to be desired. It reminds me of a dense, whole wheat parantha , which is also on the menu - which is fine if that's what you're craving :("}
{"text":"Many people are commenting on how this restaurant doesn't smell like an Indian restaurant.  This now makes sense...because it doesn't taste like an Indian restaurant either!  We ordered butter chicken and saag paneer, a staple in our household.  It was bland and tasteless.  Seriously - bland.  We will continue our search for good Indian food in High Park...I will not go back to North of Bombay."}
{"text":"We do enjoy the food at this place.  It is a bit pricy but the staff is always friendly. And the food is fresh. Take out is always a problem for us we dont live very far away but they always say 30 min to make the food and they have never been on time.  We have always waited a minimum of an hour at lest.  There is less food given with the take out as well."}
{"text":"My buddy and I walked into North of Bombay and noticed, first, that it smelled clean and airy. Our olfactory organs were not pinched by pungency from frying garam masala, curry leaves and cardamoms. The decor matched the neutral odours - well pressed table cloths, a stained floors, order to the tables and painted walls in dark colours, inviting a mood of relaxation.   An environment well served for a restaurant serving steak, but just completely backwards for Indian food. While some of us in North America might require a certain amount of hospital-like sterilization and well thought out interior design, as a connoisseur of Indian food, I simply cannot handle this juxtaposition.  An Indian restaurant should smell as though the intricate dishes have been cooking since mid morning (because - as Indian dishes, they SHOULD have been cooking since mid morning, or at least mid afternoon).  Much like the region from which the food comes, there SHOULD be at least ordered chaos to the dining hall.  After ordering, it was my hope that the food would be so delicious as to make me forget about this too-domestic-to-be-foreign establishment and allow me to savour a spicy curry that would stick to my ribs for hours to come.    Alas, it was not meant to be.  We began with an order of vegetable samosas, the highlight of the meal.  They were well fried and at least adequately spiced.  They were served with a standard selection of mint chutney, tamarind chutney and Indian salad.  Not amazing, but at least familiar.  My meal selection was an order of saag paneer, EXTRA spicy.  I've been away from Texas now for 5 weeks and long for spice that will make me widen my eyes and carefully consider my next bite.  I would expect that if anyone can service this request, it would be an Indian food restaurant.  But even here, the extra spicy produced at best a curious tingle.  Finally, for dessert, I thought I'd enjoy one of my favorite Indian sweets, a gulab jamun.  Perhaps it was a good choice - had I made it many hours in advance, but this gulab jamun had long sat in a pool of syrup and become a sugar ball only slightly reminiscent of it's once doughy consistency.  The saving grace of the establishment is that the service was prompt, friendly and smiling.  While I might not have enjoyed the product, the service I received was at least pleasant.    I can't suggest another location in the Junction or HIgh Park area for Indian food, but I can assure I'll do my best to find it!"}
{"text":"We live so close to this restaurant but took us 3 years to actually give it a try (It always looked a bit empty and dark inside). It was a quiet night at the restaurant- they have a spacious interior and the seats were cozy and comfortable. We ordered the butter chicken, mutter paneer, meat biriyani and naan. Everything was quite good (not the best Indian food we've had, but good enough). The biriyani was a bit underwhelming and just tasted like they fried a bunch of random veggies and meat together with rice."}
{"text":"There are not too many Indian restaurants in the Junction, so this place is a saviour when you have a hankering for Indian food.  I've only ordered takeout from here - the combos are affordable at $10.95, and hit the spot when needed.  The naan bread is also great, too!"}
