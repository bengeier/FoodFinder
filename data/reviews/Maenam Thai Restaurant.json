{"text":"We don't often write a review, but we felt compelled to write one this time. The food was amazingly delicious! We had the chive dumplings which were light and perfect amount of onion flavor. Our meals were both filling and had a huge hit of many flavors! We were surprised how much fresh flavor in every bite. We eat a lot of Thai food, and this is by far one of the best in Pittsburgh! It is a much recommended and must try restaurant."}
{"text":"Best Thai anywhere near Pittsburgh! Absurdly fresh, colorful, and wonderfully delicious!!! Very good value for astoundingly good food! EAT HERE NOW!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered here a few weeks ago ,, all fresh and delicious, especially loved the chive dumplings .. my boyfriend had the pork dumplings he said he wished he ordered a double order !!! So good authentic and fresh ...going to order again real soon !!!"}
{"text":"Just finished our first meal here and it won't be our last! Everything was great. Tom yum and Tom kha soups both chock full of veggies and delicious. Avocado summer rolls with yummy peanut sauce. Also had green curry and spicy basil but favorite was pad see ew (ours was chicken). Very limited seating but carry out and delivery available too. Nice to support a family business too - husband and wife team. Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"A small, cozy place with some delicious thai staples. We've been here twice now, and we love feeling like we're eating at someone's home. Food has been consistently delicious with accurate spice levels and great flavor. Our favorites are the tom yam, tom kha, red curry, spicy eggplant, and the sticky rice with custard dessert. Seating is limited to about 6-8 people inside and 2 outside, but they seem to do more take out than dine in. We love interacting with the owners and hope that they succeed!"}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh.  We had the chive dumplings and kao soy.  Anxious to try more things on the menu.  Very tasty."}
{"text":"Finally, a quality Thai restaurant in Blawnox. This is under completely new ownership than the previous Thai restaurant that occupied the space. I highly recommend the Kao Soy egg noodle dish with shrimp or chicken, absolutely delicious. We've also tried the Red Curry, Pad Kee Mow, and Pad Peanut. All delicious, and would order again. Everything is fresh, delicious, and authentic. There is some seating both inside and outside, and everyone is very friendly. Highly recommend!"}
