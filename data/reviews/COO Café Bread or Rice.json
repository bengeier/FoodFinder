{"text":"This place is awesome! One of the few restaurants serving up y?shoku and they do it well! The chef uses really good quality meat for all the dishes and service is excellent. The interior is simple, a perfect place for a solo lunch, date, or small group. Gyu don with the onsen-tamago-like egg is a must and make sure to save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and I often walked by and felt bad because this restaurant looked empty. I try to support local places so I brought my husband and a friend there for dinner last night. It was fantastic. I had the special \"Seafood three ways\" - tuna fried rice, wild salmon filet, and smoked salmon salad. It was delicious and a great value. My husband's meal - a dumpling hot pot - was not very filling so he also ordered the fries and fried chicken, which were great. It also seems very family friendly so I will come back with the kids."}
{"text":"Amazing Japanese casual comfort food. Very generous portion sizes, comfy minimalist interior, and very nice staff. My new favourite neighbourhood casual lunch and dinner spot. I've been here a number of times and it hasn't disappointed yet. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious braised beef (Gyu Don). The carrot soup with ginger was bright and zesty. Definitely try the Karaage crispy fried chicken! Happy to return and explore this menu."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Husband had the yakitori and he couldn't say enough good things about it. I had the chicken schnitzel which was also very tasty. Staff were lovely and service was quick. Would definitely recommend and go back again"}
{"text":"The best eggs benedict and chicken karage I ever tried/had in Toronto! Surprised that this place has no line ups!"}
{"text":"Hello delicious, uncomplicated, nurturing comfort food!! Venue is simple and minimalist, service is very friendly and caring (I believe it's a husband & wife team), the menu is simple and approachable, full of classics. We shared several dishes: Chicken yakitori don, chickpea kari, tempura don, beet salad, agedashi tofu, lava cake, and Japanese-style cheesecake. Every item was perfectly crafted, the portion size was just right, and the flavours were pure. I liked the recipes and presentation. It was appealing without being pretentious. Like going to dinner at a foodie-friend's place. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to Bloorcourt. Too many bars! My dining partner got carrot ginger soup, which was smooth and delicious. I got Beer Plus, which might've been a temporary special, which was Edamame + Poutine + Tall Can of Sapporo for $10, which I knew would be an instant success (beer alone was $7.50). The waitress came by with a free salad because a big group at a different table had just ordered and she was worried we would not be happy waiting. We were surprised because it really wasn't a problem, the wait seemed pretty average. My dining mate got Yakitori Don, I got Gyu Don, both of them with an egg. Great prices and really delicious. I'm craving it now just thinking about it. We were so full we got a little take-out container of some Don leftovers, which was adorable in itself for being so small."}
{"text":"My friend and I came for some Japanese cuisine-inspired brunch, surprisingly not a lot of people on a beautiful Sunday morning. We ordered the special of the day - French toast with caramelized bananas, omu-rice, egg & ankake fried rice, the chicken breast schnitzel sandwich, and the croquettes.   The French toast was divine, possibly the best I've ever had. The egg batter they mixed in with French baguette made the toast just the perfect texture of softness and sponginess. The omu-rice regrettably was not exactly an omlette with rice, but a rice with a large sheet of egg on covering it. The egg was still excellently prepared, so fluffy! The ankake of the egg & ankake fried rice was delicious as well. The croquettes were also a great choice to share as sides because some of their brunch dishes are a bit smaller than other restaurants. I would have also liked to have more vegetables with the rice brunch dishes.   Overall, a stellar y?shoku brunch and a welcome addition to Bloorcourt!"}
{"text":"First time here, glad to see a really great restaurant open up in Bloorcourt! The food was fantastic; incredibly quick and attentive service. Highly recommend the Karaage chicken and Gyu Don with rice. Portion sizes seemed perfect, and the ingredients were very fresh and flavourful.  Will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this review because this place deserves to be busy! Go there, Bloordale/Dovercourt Village/Duff Grove! Do it!  We stopped in today because the menu really hooked us (and I wanted to see what had happened to Tokyo Sushi, and I really liked their sign, tbh). We both had the schnitzel sandwich, mostly because it sounded weird enough to pique our interest (tomato sauce, mayo, fried chicken aren't generally three things I'd eat together on a sandwich), and it was SO GOOD.  They gave us karaage chicken as an appetizer promotion, and it was very, very good. The espresso shots they pulled for me were also great. Also great: the price.  The service was outstanding; smiles, hellos, check-ins, refills, even the chef came out to ask how we liked the food.  Will definitely be back to try to pulled beef dog!"}
{"text":"So good!! I'm so glad this little place has opened up in the neighbourhood. The dishes are simple, inexpensive, but also very well made and delicious. We loved everything we tried: karaage (Japanese fried chicken), shrimp croquettes, Japanese pickles, arugula salad, Gyu Don (Japanese rice bowl with pulled beef) and chicken schnitzel sandwich. So excited to go back!"}
{"text":"I have been to this cafe many times so I felt compelled to post. The food and service here are excellent. Some of my favourites include the Karaage chicken and Yakitori don. But pretty much everything here is great. A nice fusion of Japanese and French cooking."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Went here on a dinner with my girl and we had the gyoza and the karrage. It exceeded my expectations and I definitely plan on going here in the future"}
{"text":"Japanese style \"family restaurant\". Everything we ordered were so delicious,  only a little small in portion"}
{"text":"Japanese homestyle food. Real as it gets. Though not quite exactly like anything I've had before.   Friendly service. Charming place.   I was there for a brunch I guess. Omu rice and a hamburger steak special. Hamburger steak was like a divinely seasoned meatloaf. Oh the tenderness and the aroma!  Toronto is starting to really win."}
{"text":"This is my favourite brunch place in Bloorcourt. The food, service and dining area are all very good.  I would suggest the Omu rice or the french bread.   Th staff is very friendly and efficient.  The quality of every dish is very high for the price.  I would suggest this place to anybody who enjoys a calm brunch on the weekends."}
{"text":"4.5  Got seated right away on Sunday afternoon around 2pm and our server hung our coats up for us since it was a wet and rainy day. Gave us menus and took our orders. We ordered green tea and coke to start. For apps we got Dungeness crab miso soup, shrimp croquettes, pulled beef dog and the omurice based on some rave reviews on it.  Service was great except for the fact that she forgot our drinks half way through our meal we reminded her and she brought it right away and apologized. She did bring us plates for us to share our food, the chef even split our soup in 2 separate bowls.  Dungeness crab miso soup (3/5 - flavourful with good amount of crab, corn and peas. A little salty though but still good.  Shrimp croquettes (4/5) - delicious shrimp filling and crispy exterior without being too greasy and sauce was good and had chopped egg in it.   Pulled beef dog (5/5) - my favourite dish today! Beef was full of flavour, tender and had a soft melt in your mouth texture. The sauce was addictive as I ended up wiping the plate clean with the bun. The bun was crispy, chewy and soft all at the same time and the cabbage slaw was complementary to the flavourful meat.   Omurice (3/5) - was just okay not my favourite, I feel like I could make something similar at home.   Chocolate lava cake (4/5) - had an orange flavour to it, wasnt too sweet and fruits helped tone down some of the sweetness of it. Would be perfect if it was paired with vanilla ice cream or something imho  Will definetly come back again! Will try miso cod next time"}
{"text":"Good place for a quick bite.   I really enjoyed the food, the only comment is that the breaded chicken was just ok, everything else was above average.   Food is  tasty and the service is excellent.  I would recommend everyone try this place at least once."}
{"text":"Updating my review to 5 stars because for $11 plus tax and tip the seafood trio was one of the most delicious lunches I've ever had. It was very clear much care was put into each component of this deceptively simple lunch. Everything was prepared to perfection with lovely touches like a braised bok choi and green beans to compliment the flavorful salmon in light, not too sugary glaze sauce and wonderfully pungent tuna fried rice. The shrimp croquette was crispy and the sauce on it creamy and balanced, the salad was not boring which is a feat in itself. For $5.50 extra the chestnut creme brulee was on par with some of the ones I've had in France, bursting with chestnut flavor and a satisfying crack! Service is extremely prompt, genuinely friendly - water always full. Atmosphere homey, rustic and comfortable. Highly recommend, can't wait to try brunch."}
{"text":"I've found my new favourite brunch spot! COO is a quiet, warm and welcoming restaurant with friendly staff and delicious food! My husband and I shared a miso soup, karaage, omurice, veggie don, and homemade cheesecake. Everything was AMAZING. I will definitely be back soon, but with more friends/family!"}
{"text":"Cute new Japanese restaurant on Bloor west. Creamy shrimp croquettes with homemade tartare were delish - very light, fluffy and flavourful. Cod with miso and braised veg was good but a bit rubbery and not enough liquid in my bowl - hardly any. Garlic bread was meh.   I will definitely be back to try the other menu items and the poutine!  Cheesecake to go which I have high expectations for!  All in all a nice new addition to the area!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable. It looks to be a small run cafe. Quaint and simplistic in its design. You can definitely tell that they wanted to maximized their weird shape and by the corner tables in the windowed corners (I wish I took a photo but if you visit you'll see).   The cafe is run by what seems to be a family or small close knit staff of Japanese people. The menu has quite a few options but enough to just fit just a single page and a specialty menu on he side. The menu is highlighted but Japanese staples like a omurice and guydon, but also a pulled beef dog and a schnitzel sandwich.   I got the schnitzel sandwich and my partner went for a cold soba salad with smoked salmon. The sandwich came out still steaming from the frying. The Japanese really know how to fry things. It came out lightly fired and not oily at all. The mustard and the mixed greens found in the sandwich offers an slightly tart and creamy texture with a slight bitterness that fades again. It really highlights the sweetness of the chicken meat. I must say I'm not often impressed by sandwiches but this was like a wow  is this sandwich ever good. Like not in the way that it blew your mind but the wow that you get when something so simple is made so well. Honestly for me it was more or less perfection (minus my excitement to bite into it and burn the roof of my mouth on my first bite).   The soba noodles are very refreshing and sits in this cold broth below a salad. The broth is just barely has a sweet hint. Solid dish but I didn't pay that much attention because of my sandwich.   There food was done so well that I had to check out the menu board of fresh hand made desserts. We got the chestnut creme brûlée. I must say not the highlight of the meal. Not bad but to come back to earth from my sandwich I was slightly disappointed.  The sugar brûlée didn't have that crack and crumble but I think the reason was more about the custard below the brûléed top. The custard was on the softer like a pudding but the flavour tasted of chestnut and over the dessert was pretty good. I would like to try this dessert again and see if the quality remains the same or with a more tempered expectation.   The service was great. You can see the server observing and take give you space just to allow you to explore your menu. She definitely took a step in and then took a step back as we looked to be in conversation and didn't really know what to order yet.   My overall feeling is that this place is a genuine gem in this neighbourhood. Nothing to complain about and looking forward to go out of my way to eat here again."}
{"text":"This is my go to restaurant. I've been here a dozen times and cannot get enough of their food. The flavours are always clean and unique.    The Seafood trio is always changing, but always good. It always comes with salmon rice that would be great as a dish on its own.  The pulled pork is a fusion of western barbecue pulled pork made with Japanese flavours.   I recommend getting the fries at every opportunity. They are crispy and full of flavour."}
{"text":"Nice, quaint family run place - my wife (who's Japanese) especially loves it here. Toronto has an abundance of Japanese restaurants (probably more than any other ethnic cuisine) - mostly Sushi, Izikaya, Ramen, Teppanyaki or Yakitori places. Coo is nothing like any of them - very original - it's almost like you're in Japan and have someone cooking for you in their home. Authentic, yet, original would be the best way to describe it. Mostly Japanese influence, but each dish has some Western type ingredients or twists."}
{"text":"Delicious! Tried the karage, beet salad, croquette and berry sorbet.  Karage had that perfect crispy skin that is so very Japanese. Also the cuts of chicken were inline with what you would expect. They added some curry powder to the batter. Not bad. Came with a lemon wedge and two types of mayo: regular and spicy.  Beet salad was nice. A bit light on the beets. Croquettes were nice as well; crispy and creamy. Very berry sorbet!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood. Omu-rice featured a perfectly done moist omelette, the fried rice with two poached eggs had great ginger-soy flavour, shrimp croquettes came with excellent pickles and salad, and the best part: hot, freshly fried kara-age, crispy outside and juicy inside. Dishes all had a slightly sweet note, which is usually not for me, but I didn't mind. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Such a great spot with wonderful staff and food that is always on-point. I have never had anything here that didn't completely surpass my expectations.   Their tempura coating is light and never dripping in oil. The fries (and especially the sauce served with the fries) are awesome.   Great options for meat-eaters and vegetarians alike."}
{"text":"This place is newly stablished, still searching for it's own fusion identity, with several things they could improve (decoration, sides, and time wise). However, the Mediterranean cod stayed on my mind like a perfect combination of flavours, textures, and looks. I didn't ask for it (damn), but the bites I had were harmonic. The capers gave and interesting contrast to the freshness.  My election was the miso marinated cod. The cod tasted exactly like a solid miso soup!!! It was falling apart in tender-firm flakes. It was accompanied by steamed veggies and a bowl of rice. I liked the flavour of the fish but it's sides didn't help to contrast the saltiness.  The croquettes were creamy, with chunks of fresh shrimps. I enjoyed them a lot.  Don't go when in a hurry."}
{"text":"Love this place. Fresh, deliciously prepared Japanese home cooking. I had the miso marinated cod and fried tofu. Excellent flavor and texture, delicate, not too salty."}
{"text":"The food is really, really good! We had the yakitori don, pulled beef dog and a side of fries. Everything was amazing. The service was friendly and helpful, the portions were satisfying but not overwhelming, and the prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here I was excited to try this place out - but when I got to the café, my initial impression was... Huh? It was a small and simple place, with a fairly small menu and seeing as I didn't really want anything they had to offer, I thought this was one of those places with overinflated reviews. But I made the journey here, so I had to take the plunge - and I'm glad I did.  I ordered the hamburger steak for takeout and every single piece of the meal was individually boxed in containers to avoid a mess. It might not be super friendly for the environment, but I did appreciate it. The salad was whatever, and the ketchup fried rice was bland, but the main part, the hamburger, was delicious - juicy, meaty, and the sauce wasn't too overpowering but really brought out the umami of the meat. I am a big fan of hamburger steaks and this one did not disappoint. I also ordered a chicken karaage, but found it to taste bitter for some reason, I probably wouldn't get it again. My friend ordered the gyu-don and said it was just ok, but I didn't try it myself so I can't properly judge.  The service was friendly and quick, and the hamburger itself was quite good so I would probably make the trip back here again. Their menu selection isn't all that impressive to me, but perhaps I shouldn't judge a restaurant by its menu? Given the high ratings this place received, I should probably give some of the other dishes a try - maybe it'll surprise me like this hamburger steak did. It also looks like they have a better brunch menu so perhaps I should come back for that."}
{"text":"Had no idea this place existed until I randomly walked by. Didn't expect much but thought I'd try it out for lunch takeout. Had the gyu beef don and it was amazing! The beef was moist and soft. The salad was ok, nothing special, just your typical salad. Will definitely come back to try their karaage"}
{"text":"This is an excellent spot for a tasty cheap lunch! Food was absolutely delicious, and you can tell that the owners and staff put a lot of thought and care into the place. The ambiance is warm, inviting, very cozy, very comfortable. The menu leans toward Japanese comfort food, but with hints of flavors from other cultures. I'd stop short of calling it \"fusion\", as that might give you the wrong idea.  I think it's more of a unique, multicultural Canadian Japanese cooking, and its fantastic. Just go!"}
{"text":"The service was really good, and the food that they served was super delicious. The presentation was nice and looked very delicious."}
{"text":"Food was very akin to that in Shinagawa.  Omurice was fluffy and had the right creamy texture over a bed of tomato rice. The rice could have used some flavour, since the chicken was a bit bland. Really wanted some ketchup on top of the egg instead of the bokchoy which was not consumed.  Gyudon had a delicious poached egg on top. The dish was flavourful without too much salt. and slow-cooked to the perfect consistency similar pulled pork texture. Portion was quite large  Shrimp Croquette (korokke) was the best dish! The cream was nice and warm which flowed out of the croquette after one bite. Was so happy that the shrimp was not overcooked.  Meal came to around $37 which is quite decent for a brunch, not to mention that was service was good. Hope they will have more seafood options in the future.   Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Suk and I picked up guy don and karaange for take out.  The karaange is typically made with wheat flour but the chief made it with corn for us.  Although we grabbed take out, the service was lovely while we waited.   The ambiance was pleasant with a good sound track.   I did find it a bit bright though.  They have track lighting and it seems they should be able to dim the lights (hoping) because otherwise, it gives off a slight cafeteria feel, despite the good music.   The 5 stars are well deserved for the food, which is amazing, as well as for their service and for their chief changing his normal recipe to accommodate our eating requirements.   I cannot wait to return and eat their entire menu"}
{"text":"Second time here, but loving the food all over again! I'm a little bias because I love karaage, but they have great, crispy, juicy karaage served that wholesome home made mayonnaise!  This time the soup was a refreshing carrot ginger soup, and I decided to explore the other side of the world with their Pulled Beef Dog option, opposite to the Gyu Don I had last week.  Sumptuous, soft bread giving way to the gyu filling and that ever curious pickles ginger making everything sing a little happier.  Didn't have time for dessert, but I will be back... For that darn good lemon cheesecake.  Its really good Japanese food. Reminds me of home cooking, and the love that's put into it that makes it so addictive."}
{"text":"This place doesn't get enough praise. It's like a hidden gem among a sea of an increasing number of Japanese restaurants in the city. Delicious food, warm family-friendly atmosphere, serving teishoku (western-influenced Japanese dishes). Please check it out!"}
{"text":"Overall excellent service and food! We ordered a soup and wanted to share it. Once the waitress found out that we wanted to share, she served the soup in two separate bowls. Very attentive and considerate!   The brunch menu is pretty much the same as the regular menu except for the price. The main dishes on the brunch menu are a dollar more expensive than the lunch menu. There is no lunch option on weekend . This information is available on their website.   Even though it is a little more expensive than I anticipated and the portion size is a little small, the food is delicious. It is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Miso marinated cod is too salty...couldn't finish it. The omurice is good but maybe less butter would make it better."}
{"text":"This place has smaller portions with lots of home feel. It offers a blend of japanese style western foods and other fusion offerings.   We ordered the burger with rice (kind of like a tomato version of loco moco, i personally prefer the original dish, but to each their own), the beet salad (excellent fresh bite with citrus and mixed greens), the chicken kara'age? (THIS WAS DELICIOUS, SUPER FRESH AND PERFECTLY FRIED), the eggs, fries and toast breakfast (with fluffy eggs and delicious fries), the french toast (a little soft in texture, but amazing taste with fresh whipped cream), and the beef something dish (also delicious with tender beef and perfectly cooked rice).   I would definitely come back here for more comfort style eats. They really have mastered the KeepItSuperSimple model, with their sparse decor and two page menu, it really is all about the food.   The desserts looked amazing, we just didn't have the room...will have to come back for those!"}
{"text":"Toronto, where most Japanese restaurants offer a similar array of items, and are largely centred around sushi, needs more restaurants like COO Cafe.   COO serves up a style of Japanese cuisine called Yoshoku - Japanese-style western food, and a stark contrast to what most Canadians think of as Japanese food.   Remember: almost all cuisines are spectacularly varied, and Japanese is no exception to this.  Japan was one of first major Asian economies to open its borders to trade with Europe, which heavily influenced many elements of their food. Trade introduced ingredients such as meat, curry, and ketchup (all of which are featured on COO's menu).   At COO, I ordered the omurice: a dish that has recently gained in popularity in social media, but was originally developed after WWII, when access to its key ingredients became more widespread.   COO's omurice was solid, if not spectacular.   Overall, definitely worth the visit. I will be back to try more items."}
{"text":"Heard about the place from a friend - tried out the Gyu-don and french fries....  Gyu-don isn't you're traditional Japanese style - similar to a pull pork style... uber awesome!  French fries with a side of their homemade mayonnaise... again best I've had!  Definitely coming back here to try out other stuff on the menu! ????"}
{"text":"Time for another round of Leslie's pros and cons:  Pros:  Cute little café and restaurant Food is not your standard items that everyone else has Clean premises Nice and polite service Lots of meat in the 'Gyudon' (read on...) Attention to detail: even the cherry tomato was peeled and had no skin Juicy and flavourful karaage - well done! The 2 types of mayonnaise served were indeed delicious and original Clean washrooms  Cons: Guydon (beef and rice dish) was not guydon. They serve beef kakunidon and call it gyudon!! Why? Egg on guydon was extra $1 The French Fries were too crispy, almost burnt and tasteless Guydon did not come in a 'don' bowl, but was served on a plate Restaurant does not try to be authentic Japanese, but Westernized fusion (some may see this as a positive)  The couple who run the place have a good thing going and now that their teenagers are growing older have taken the splash and operate their own restaurant in an area that has one too many Tim Hortons and pizza joints... Hope it is a success."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, every time I've tried different meals and appetizers. Omu rice has been the best (life changing!), and I always get the Kara-age (fried chicken). This time they had a French onion soup special, best I've had. The chefs at Coo know how to prepare beautiful and delicious food.  It's still not crazy well known yet, so go treat your tastebuds before the lineups start happening."}
{"text":"Came for lunch/brunch menu on a Sunday. Ordered the yakitori-don, gyu-don, and the daily special which was salmon, tuna fried rice and shrimp croquettes amongst our group of 4. I loved my yakitori-don, which was really flavourful and a step up from the typical donburi type of dishes you would typically find in Toronto. The gyu-don was a delicious upgrade from what I'd normally expect if I ordered gyu-don, which is usually thin slices of beef. The chef's take on this Japanese staple dish, was a very soft and hearty portion of braised beef, with great flavour. The daily special, I only sampled the tuna fried rice, but was told it was delicious. Overall, really enjoyed the food here, and will gladly come back to eat some more awesome Japanese comfort food, with a well thought out western fusion twist to it. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Order everything. I had the French toast. Omurice. Amazing. Dungeonous crab miso chowder. Eggs Benedict. Karaage. Needless to say. I was very full. All were good but hands down the omurice is a must get"}
{"text":"Nice relaxed vibe, great service.  Yakitori Don with Ohitashi, paired with a couple local craft beers, exceptional! Finished it all off with an espresso and a dish of the chef's unbelievably delicious cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and friendly service! The food is very yummy and feels very fresh as well. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We decided to try this place based on its reviews and were very happy we did! They serve some Japanese staples, and Japanese-style Western food (not something everyone can appreciate or \"get\" but it's done well). The food feels home-cooked (with lots of care) and is simple, and is very well priced (especially compared to lots of over-priced joints in the area). We ordered the shrimp croquettes to start, the chicken dumpling hot pot and chicken karaage dinner specials as mains, and then shared a cheesecake for dessert. Everything was great and we will definitely be back to try some other things on the menu. A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"COO Cafe Bread and Rice is an interesting concept. It's a French-Japanese brunch place run by some locals. The ambiance is extremely peaceful, the place is super clean, and the food overall was simple and interesting. The servers were friendly and speedy as well.  What I like most about this cafe is that the brunch options aren't OVERLY heavy. You won't find yourself with a plate of fries/tator tots/toast left over upon completing your meal. Nothing is overly sweet, and every part of the dish is just so simple but tasty, it's kind of hard to leave leftovers (unless you had no appetite to begin with).  We ordered the Omu rice, karaage, and the Eggs & Ankake Fried Rice dish.  Omu Rice - french style omlette  on a chicken fried rice cooked in a tomato-ey base. The tomato flavour is very subtle... it's nothing like ketchup or tomato sauce. The omlette is very fluffy and buttery  Karaage - has a nice crunch. They do a good job of removing excess oil and grease. Paired with a nice sauce. 4 smallish pieces are served.  Eggs & Ankake Fried rice - comes with two poached eggs cooked just the way I like it (runny but not undercooked). The chicken fried rice dish is very smokey with hints of soy sauce undertones. There is also a single bok choy to add some colour (remember to eat your veggies!).   I would really have liked it if the dishes had more bok choy and veggies to go with all the carbs and eggs being consumed. The veggies would pair very nicely with the Asian flavours embodied by the dish.   Overall, french japanese brunch was an interesting experience, and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Super great tasty food, great little fusion restaurant for the area. Friendly staff as well! Had the Vegan Chickpea Curry with Naan bread; great warm fresh bread and tasty red curry will be coming back."}
