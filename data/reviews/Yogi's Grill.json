{"text":"You can expect the quality and service you get from restaurants without paying restaurant prices. Clean and well-managed fast food place! So yummy!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Kyong and her husband run an excellent restaurant and the only thing better than the food is the warm smile and pleasant greeting you receive upon entering.  Try the Arizona bowl - it's fabulous...."}
{"text":"Get the chicken teriyaki bowl and skip everything else. I just got the tempura and teriyaki combo for lunch. The tempura was a carrot and a zucchini i think. Then some long thing with a shrimp tail but I don't think shrimp are pencil size. There was two CA rolls that were marginal but they do not give you ginger or wasabi. Wtf? $10.82 for lunch just not worth it.  They need more lunch specials."}
{"text":"I frequently go here, I only get chicken teriyaki (all white meat) and it's solid. Restaurant always appears to be clean."}
{"text":"Great food but losing a star due to the styrofoam.  Given the price and quality of the food, this is just plain wrong.  Please get some plates for dine in customers!!"}
{"text":"Spicy chicken yakisoba is fantastic; finished with a miso soup... Can't be beaten. Service is fantastic and food is amazing."}
{"text":"I love yogis. Always have ! However , this location falls short every time when it comes to sauce. I know I cant be alone in the notion that if you want a teyeraki bowl, you want teyeraki SAUCE. It is always dry as a bone , and if you ask for extra they are less than generous. It's disapointing because I have been to yogis before in several other locations and it is a completely different bowl here. Still fresh. And lovely people. But not worth the money to get dry rice and some meat."}
{"text":"I love this place and love that they use styrofoam! The Arizona bowl (rice, crab meat, avocado,  cucumber, lemon slice and teriyaki sauce on the side) is amazing and I order it with extra lemon. The staff is so friendly and I can tell they are hard workers."}
{"text":"This is our second time eating at one of these Yogi Grills and first time at this location. NOT HAPPY AT ALL! The cashier Lizabeth was rude she didn't even ask how she could help just walked up to the register than while I start to say my order she picks up the phone and takes somebody else order after she hangs up she just staring all dumb like she is bothered she has to even be doing this. Then before she swipes my card I ask to add avocado she rolls her eyes than starts pushing buttons on her register all mad. While we wait for our order she looks over at us I am assuming  while packing our order looks at us all stupid and ties the bag. When we get home to eat this is what I find in our order this Avocado we paid extra for. I'm not expecting 5 star service but better customer service than this and definitely not happy about paying for something that can't even be touched."}
{"text":"Showed up at 8:40 when they close at 9.  Waited in line, got to the counter and employees said they stop taking new orders at 8:50.  We wanted an order to go.  Went over and spent $50 at Chipotle and 4 other customers ordered at Chipotle that they turned away.  Horrible night manager.  Glad he gets out of there early.  Can't be good for business to turn away hundreds of dollars every night."}
{"text":"We like to eat here for lunch of a quick dinner.  They are always very friendly and the food is nice and hot and always delicious.  The chicken yakisoba is really good and the teriyaki bowls.  We tried the sushi also, it was good."}
{"text":"Hanging out with one of my friends today & got treated to lunch. First time here & never heard of this place before. Had to say my visit was excellent. My friend ordered us both the same beef with rice lunch specials. These specials come with drinks. Drink choices are endless with the touch screen drink dispenser. Meal is brought to your table. Food was hot & meat portions are generous. Music is left playing softly in the background while you eat."}
{"text":"The food at Yogis Grill is pretty good and decently priced.  I like the idea that you can get half of a sushi roll.  The lunch special is nicely priced and, in my opinion, a good value.  However, sometimes the chicken is undercooked (as it was today) or includes a tough, chewy part of the chicken.  I had the same combination bowl lunch special for lunch the other day and with the exception of one piece, the rest of the chicken was cooked appropriately.  So yeah, sometimes hit or miss.  I've had the crunch roll which was tasty and nicely priced for fast sushi.    There is ample seating, but service can be rather slow.  It was a given that the sushi roll I ordered took longer to prepare than the lunch special I ordered.  However, the slow service started at the register.  I visited around noon during a weekday.  The line wasn't that long at the register so I was looking forward to ordering quickly.  After the cashier took the order from the customer in front of me, the cashier answered to phone to take a phone order.  The phone order was a long one and I ended up waiting for a long time as the cashier insisted that the phone order was more important than mine.  I almost got out of line and left, but she must've sensed my annoyance and took my order while she put the phone order on hold.  Service would have been more quick is there was more than one person at the register and taking phone orders, especially during the peak of the lunch hour.    They have a wide variety of food, but I will definitely think twice about ordering here.  The amount of time I have to available to wait for my order and the potential quality of the food (whether I feel like taking a chance on undercooked chicken) will be factors I take into consideration."}
{"text":"I normally don't leave that many negative reviews but my advice is not to go here. during dinner hours.  My husband likes this place so I stopped to get takeout and so far I have waited 30 minutes for two chicken teriyaki bowls.   Keep in mind I have waited less than most as there's probably 15 people in line and they have three people working.   Additionally I don't even think the food is that good. I don't get it"}
{"text":"AMAZING teriyaki and pot stickers.. I could go here for lunch every day!"}
{"text":"Food is really good here. Staff is always quick and friendly. However, I believe there is something wrong with their soda machine because their sodas do not taste right and I have tried a few different sodas on different days."}
{"text":"This place was okay. Maybe I'm not a teriyaki kind of person, but I wasn't impressed.  This being our first time, it took some time for us to decide what to order. The cashier was pleasant and didn't make us feel rushed. I ordered the cucumber salad. My friend ordered a teriyaki bowl along with some dumplings for us to share. The food came out fairly quickly. The salad was brought out first then the other items.   The salad was disappointing. It looked nothing like the picture on the menu board. It was a lot of iceberg lettuce topped with strips of cucumber and a couple small cherry tomatoes. A small plastic container of salad dressing came on the side per my request. The dumplings were good, but a bit greasy for my taste. My friend thought the teriyaki bowl was okay.  There was really nothing about the food that stood out. It was average food that could be found at any Asian cookie cutter franchise.   Not sure why everything is in styrofoam or plastic. No dishes that way, but it didn't add to the experience. I didn't like that dining in meant I ate my salad out of a plastic container with a plastic fork.  Overall, a clean place with average prices, average food and a pleasant cashier.  I would recommend it if you like teriyaki, but don't go expecting anything amazing."}
{"text":"THE Best Yogis Grill of all locations.  Teriyaki bowl is always on point. Fluffy rice, soft tender sweet teriyaki chicken, and perfectly made sushi rolls.  The beef bowl is too tender for me but still pretty decent. All the other bowls/sides are just as good and the customer service is always on point.  This spot does it the best and I can say that without a doubt, i will always come here."}
{"text":"Just had Yogis for the first time. I had the 23 chicken and beef teriyaki plate. The beef was some of the best I have had as far as eating out goes. I will definitely be back for more. Four stars because I don't like Iceberg lettus, but other than that it was really good!"}
{"text":"Well, we have had this a few times and overall it's pretty good. Of course, you can find better but, for our family it has a little something for everyone. Sushi is good, spicy chix bowl had a nice heat, and the kids like the pot stickers. However, egg rolls are small and fair at best.  I'd give at 3.5 stars out of 5."}
{"text":"I love this location. The people here are always so nice! They always greet us so kindly! I normally get the spicy chicken teriyaki bowl. The service is fast and the food is plentiful. The regular bowl is 6.29. This usually fills me up quickly. The spicy sauce is amazing. They even sell it in the bowl. This is truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot! fast, clean, friendly. Everything I've ordered from the menu has been pretty tasty. I personally like their Arizona bowl, which is like a giant California roll -- bowl style. Lots of avocado included too :)   Sometimes the food can take a while to get to you. I've noticed that when you order a roll, sometimes it's the first thing that gets to your table, other times it's the last, when you've already devoured most of your other food (sometimes I'll get 1/2 a roll with a small bowl). But I only get a 30 min lunch and I'm always back in the office on time.  Being from Los Angeles, I haven't run into too many reasonably priced little Japanese restaurants (as opposed to the high priced fancy fusion places) that serve yaki soba and udon so I'm very happy to have found this place."}
{"text":"I'll be honest... I'm a little leery of getting sushi in a \"fast casual\" setting.  I would never order a souffle at Mickey D's and eating sushi out of a fast food container just seems... well... a little uncivilized.    The sushi was better than I expected although it was rather slow to reach our table.  Perhaps the wait time is more in line with a typical sushi restaurant but not what you expect in a place with a soda machine and Judge Judy.  The cashier was super nice. She checked on us after we received our food and called out goodbye as we were leaving.    Each sushi order comes in a styrofoam take-out container with the lid removed.  The table gets crowded quickly and it's a bit difficult to share.  The prices were average but the rolls were a fair bit bigger than your standard fish joint.    I would be willing to return but I probably won't.  Nothing personal Yogi, but I think I prefer getting my raw on in an actual restaurant."}
{"text":"For me this place is perfect for lunch.    Cheap, good food and lunchtime portions of sushi on the side.  Clean, quick and friendly staff.  Can get hot during lunch because of the angle of the glass windows.   They have a steamed vegetable dish with brown rice for very little money which makes a perfect everyday fast meal which is ideal if you want to stay away from fried and burgers.     The fact that they have quick small cheap portions of sushi to go on the side if fantastic.   THANKS FOR ALSO PLAYING KLOVE loud and proud which is unusual for a business these days, extra star cause of that."}
{"text":"Each time I've been here I've received excellent service and amazing food !! Even their sushi is awesome ! And finding a good sushi bar is not easy in Phoenix. Their menu is pretty diverse and has veggie and tofu options for those who are choosing to not eat meat. The kitchen looks very clean and each kitchen employee is wearing a cooking hat. Great place for lunch and dinner ! Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"Very fresh white meat an teriyaki sauce.  It takes a awhile for them to prepare food even when it's not busy so be prepared for good food but a little wait."}
{"text":"Third try at Yogi's. I will say they are very pleasant, very fast and very efficient.  20 guests eating and only two waiting for food.   I ordered the Beef Teriyaki, Gyoza and a drink for $15.89. Last try at that price if it doesn't deliver on taste. After I ordered, I saw the tempura on the menu, which sounded good.   My lunch arrived eight mins later. The beef was plentiful but mostly flavorless. I had to coat it with teriyaki sauce, which made it too sweet. Most of it went uneaten. The salad was good but didn't have much dressing, so half went uneaten. The Gyoza were good, better than the first time.   Unless I'm craving tempura, which I can get at Bento Box, I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good food and reasonably fast service at linch time.  I ordered the Garlic noodles with chicken special. It was good, not too much garlic. The only disappointment was the portion of chicken was not as large as my coworkers servings when they ordered the terry bowls. Not sure if it is as planned but the garlic noodles was at a slightly higher price so I figure it would be equal or a little more. Anyway everything I ordered was hot and tasty. I will just keep trying till I find the perfect meal."}
{"text":"Yogi's Grill is my go to spot for sushi on the go in Norterra. Typically, I go with the Hawaiian Roll which is crab mix with tuna on top - so good but they came out with new menu items that I had to try. I got the Spicy Tuna bowl and let me tell you, it def satisfied the tummy. I am happy they brought the new poke bowl items to the menu! #winning!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend dragged me to this place after a friends recommendation. I'm picky. And I don't like sushi. Reluctantly, I agreed.    I assumed this place would be like Samurai Sam's after seeing the Yelp pictures. I was wrong.   Since I was already wrong, and my boyfriends friend said she always got the chicken/beef teriyaki bowl, I figured I must go with that choice. Let's do it.  Then I see that they have spicy teriyaki sauce. I'm a sucker for anything spicy. Make that shit as spicy as you can.  The super upbeat and friendly staff (order-taker and cook) directed us to the condiment station that had one of those new fancy 100000+ combo coke machines, and told us they had free extra teriyaki sauce in the ketchup-style pump thing. I grabbed one, and didn't even need to use it.  The chicken was nice and crispy, juicy, and flavorful. I was actually shocked at how good it was. This is the best teriyaki chicken I have had at any restaurant.   The beef was good. Wasn't as good as the chicken though. The chicken stole the show. Beef was a little too thin after being spoiled by the perfectly prepared  chicken.   I had egg rolls, they were standard (like panda express type) and delicious. Remember, I'm picky, I like simple things.   My boyfriend had the California rolls and ate every bite. He's as picky as me (if not worse) but grew up in Hawaii so has a slight different preference in taste as I do (an AZ native who doesn't eat any seafood).   I loved this place. I was pleasantly surprised by the food quality, the attitude from the young man taking orders & the woman who seemed to be cooking/delivering your food, and cleanliness of this restaurant. I will be returning. Thank you  PS: They don't serve alcohol, but I wish they did so I could make this a happy hour/weeknight destination to hang out with friends!"}
{"text":"Terrible delivery time. Placed an order at 5pm, received my food at 7pm... it took them 2 hours to prepare the food! I called at 630 (this is after one hour and half), and they said theyre still working on the food, meaning the food was not even sent out yet after 1 hour and half!!!  The taste of the sushi's were good but the Arizona bowl barely had any crabmeat in it, it was just plain rice...   Because of the terrible delivery and since the food was not all that to wait 2 hours for, i will never order with them again!!   Thanks"}
{"text":"Its like a hidden secret, my first time in Yogi's grill was a few nights ago and the food was absolutely amazing. So two days later im back to get some more the spicy chicken and beef teriyaki bowl is insanely good! It is directly across from chipotle but its food is great and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone in the North Phoenix area."}
{"text":"First, I would like to say the customer service is excellent.    Many times I have gone into Yogi's just for a soda, last week was the first time I actually ordered food.  I'm a big fan of their teriyaki rice bowl.  The chicken is very tender and the sauce is perfect, not too sweet like some places.  I tried the spicy sauce and it is yummy.  The spicy sauce is perfect on the side, mixed with the regular sauce.  They have my favorite Coke machine.  I don't drink caffeine, my favorite soda is the ginger ale with vanilla.  After two visits, this is my new go to place for a teriyaki chicken bowl.  Looking forward to trying other selections from the menu."}
{"text":"Although Yogis are found around the valley the first one I went to was the one in Phone on Camelback road and 16th street.  The one on Happy Valley is ok but I wasn't impressed. As a comparison to the one in Phoenix on Camelback I have to say that this one is not as generous with their portions. I think they should be equally as good but did not feel that way. I though this may have been a one off but I returned a second time and they were consistent with their same portions which did not compare to the one on Camelback. I was disappointed with the portion size and the quality of the chicken which I found to be cold and a not dry. I had the chicken teriyaki bowl and ordered the large one at that.  I will keep going to the one on Camelback."}
{"text":"Great service and knowledge from the girl in the front.  Told her I was new to this area and needed two meat bowls and one vegetarian.  She pointed them out quickly and I had many options.  Clean and friendly here.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"If you're craving Teriyaki chicken or beef, this is where you need to go! Seriously. Awesome food and friendly service! Definitely coming back for more :)"}
{"text":"Good food! Great lunch specials also. I like the hummus here. Pita with beef is great too!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love coming here! Always great service and the owner is truly the greatest and even gave me a little gift on Christmas Eve! Never have I seen a business care so much for there customers! We will be back again and again :) great food, we love the katsu plate and teriyaki."}
{"text":"Love this place! Its healthy, fresh delicious food. Its not zippy fast because its fresh made to order so it'll take a few min! Chill out, geez.  Like spicy? Get the spicy teriyaki!"}
{"text":"I loved this place! My only beef is that they use styrofoam! 4 stars for that.  It's 2013 and we know what it does to the planet. It never Leaves! Otherwise , my hubby loves teriyaki and I love sushi and I think it was wonderful. The girl in the front was very nice,all the condiments were available at a all you want bar and the sushi was very fresh. It was a little expensive but it's Sushi! I can't wait to go back and try the noodles and croquettes!"}
{"text":"Suprisingly excellent! The hub and I wanted something different and still on the healthy(ish) side. It's been a super rough week for cooking at home. Decided on Yogi's. We went to the restaurant to order and planned on taking home. They have a good selection and I had to go with what my fellow Yelpers recommended: chicken teriyaki bowl. With two exceptions: I went with the spicy teriyaki sauce and low carb style (and extra 99 cents). I also opted for the regular not large size.  The spicy teriyaki is sweet, tangy, and spicy. Loved it. Chicken had a nice flavor, char marks, and was tender (next time I would opt to thrown down the extra 99 cents for all white meat just to keep it leaner). When you go for the low carb/protein style they give steamed but still crunchy (in a good way) cabbage with carrots and broccoli. They garnish is with green onions and thrown so extra sauces in the bag. I really enjoyed it and I feel so full!  The Hub went for the large chicken teriyaki bowl with rice and no spicy teriyaki. He was really happy with his meal and chided me \"how come you don't let me eat here more often?\" Gah."}
{"text":"Great place to sit down for a quick meal or take food to go. They have everything from teriyaki  bowls, sushi, tempura, and a few sides. You walk up and order and then sit and wait for your food. There is plenty of tables to sit inside. The lady that works the front and takes your order is super nice.   They have tons of options for great prices. Perfect place to satisfy a sushi craving for cheap.   The teriyaki bowls are delicious and a great portion. They have sizes regular and large that has tons of meat and sure to fill you up completely! You can tell they make the chicken to order because it's juicy, fresh, and has that good char flavor from the girl. The rice is soft and there teriyaki sauce is delicious. They even bottle it and it's available to purchase for about $4-$5.   Overall everything tasted really fresh and I would recommend. Looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I don't live in the Phoenix area but I always stop in to Yogi's when I'm in the valley. Okhwa is always so nice and welcoming. I typically order the chicken or beef teriyaki plates and they are always delicious! I highly recommend this Yogi's and always look forward to my next trip in!"}
{"text":"Chicken teriyaki protein style is Delicious!! They have amazing teriyaki sauce that is unlimited!!  It's a little expensive for the portion you receive......!!"}
{"text":"If you love teriyaki and sushi Yogi's Grill is your place to go. Although, their menu is not extensive I will guarantee they will delight you with their food options. They have sushi, beef and chicken among other stuff. I was a little scare to try it but after deciding to give it a shot I was amazed with the taste and quality of their food. What I like the most from this place is that everything is made from scratch, unlike panda express or other Asian restaurant where they have pre-made food sitting in the hot window. However, they are very fast at cooking your dish. Yes, they might take time to cook your chicken or sushi during rushing hours but they will ensure your food is cooked perfectly. In addition, they provide take-out.   After driving a couple minutes throughout the Norterra plaza, I decided to try out Yogi's Grill because I was craving some chicken and rice. This place is not in a strategic area because it is hidden in a corner between Best Buy and Chipotle. After my first visit, this place became my to-go restaurant for a week. I would give them 6 stars if I could. The place is very clean and organized. The bathrooms are shiny clean. They have a Coke soda machine that I have never seen before in my life. It's touch electronic soda machine that provides you a wide variety of coke products.   During my first visit I was a little confused in what to order, the cashier approached me and asked me if I needed any suggestions. She showed me to go menu with all the food options. I finally decided to try the Large Chicken Teriyaki Bowl. I'm not a huge fan of teriyaki sauce, but their sauce is exceptional. The white rice texture was very smooth, it felt like it just came up from the crockpot. The chicken was very tender and juice. The bowl will fill you up because they provide you with large portions, you can even eat for lunch for the next day. I was very pleased with my choice.   The restaurant is a family owned restaurant, they run the business as well. The staff members are very friendly, they are always smiling at you. The cashier takes your order as well as she delivers the food to your table, always with a smile. They meticulously take your food order and ask you if you want all the garnishes they put in.   One thing I would complain about and this is not an issue is the layout of the place. During lunch hours from 11:00 am - 2:00 pm they have lunch specials. Combos from $8-10 including a drink. The place fills up very quickly, so you have to get there early in order to get a table, if not you will be sharing tables with other people, which I don't mind. Also, the place only has TV and the various times I have been there, sometimes is off."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge sushi eater but my husband and I each ordered tuna and salmon sushi and split it. I have no complaints. It was good. I ate my half and enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"great little place to get fresh Asian food , I like the service , I like there prices"}
{"text":"Always fast and delicious! I always get the veggies, teriyaki chicken and rice plate. I recommend it"}
{"text":"This is place has amazing food! I got the the spicy tuna bowl and my fiancé got the shrimp yakisoba. Clean place and very nice staff!"}
{"text":"I always have a great experience here. I love the food and they take care in the presentation. Kyong (I think her name is) is lovely. She even ran my drink out to my car when I forgot it. I'm not sure if every location is nice but the one off happy valley is definitely worth visiting."}
{"text":"I just went here on a whim and was not disappointed, they have great service, the food was good, and the prices great. I was surprised to see sushi available but it was still pretty good. If your looking for healthy stuff,they have that too."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Always good and fresh, I love the soups and bowls! The sauce they use for the bowls is also good, I always take extra lol"}
{"text":"I love yogi's food. The chicken and rice bowls are the go to item for my wife and I when we are going to get fast food. The people who work here are very nice and the place is clean. If you have not tried it yet you should give it a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'll preface this review by stating that I did not sample the sushi at Yogi's Grill.  I dined here twice in the last eight days and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of lunch and dinner fare.   Being a creature of habit, I ordered the Salmon Teriyaki with Vegetables (white rice) on both occasions.  The teriyaki was not syrup-y (for lack of better terminology) and the salmon was cooked quite nicely.  It was a nice cut of fish on both occasions with healthy portions, overall.  The steamed vegetables were mostly bland, but let's face it - they're steamed vegetables.  Not exactly an exciting side to begin with, but it was a fairly healthy meal!    The service was good.  My order was taken promptly.  The food was brought out on both occasions in a timely manner.  The restaurant was clean, overall and I did not have any issues on either occasion.  The price is right considering the portions of food they give you.  I would not hesitate to recommend Yogi's Grill to any of my friends or family."}
{"text":"This is a nice little family place that competes well (blowing them out of the water) with the Chipotle and Smash Burger nearby.  They are always friendly and quick. Once I'd been a few times they greeted me by name and seemed to remember my favorite. (Get a #66, spicy, with extra meat).   The only down side is they have one of those \"one bazillion kinds of Coke\" machines that create a line and make me consider lime/cherry Mr. Pibb (trust me, it is a bad idea).  This place is great for lunch or dinner on their own. But if you are thinking Chipotle or Smash Burger, trust me, you'd prefer Yogi's."}
{"text":"Went here out of convince (shopping in the area and starving)  we had the teriyaki bowls and were very pleased .. Nice clean cut chicken (we upgraded to white meat) just enough sauce to where it didn't make the rice soggy , fresh rice (kinda sticky , just how I like) next time I'll try the same thing with veggies though. To top it off , The lady working was very friendly :) we will def be back!"}
{"text":"I dined at a Yogi's Grill near work several years ago and was not impressed at all. So when I saw this new location near home, nothing pushed me to go right away. But then one evening, I reaaaaaaaally wanted a teriyaki bowl. Since there aren't many options, I decided to give Yogi's another shot. This time, I was impressed! It does sometimes take a little time for your order to be ready, but I'm sure that's because everything is being made fresh, so I don't mind.   The teriyaki chicken is tender and fairly lean, the rice is perfect and the sauce is great. The only thing I don't like is the sliced scallions they garnish with. I usually don't like raw onions of any sort. I'm a quasi sushi fan, and all the rolls I've had have been great. Also made fresh to order."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm addicted to their traditional teriyaki chicken bowl- their sauce is just-sweet enough, and the diced green onion over top is a nice touch. I tend to visit during lunch to take advantage of the special (bowl + drink = $7). I've been to a couple locations and they're mostly always busy around this time of the day. Staff is friendly, place is always clean, etc. My friend likes the california rolls with avocado- looks pretty tasty. If you're in the mood for a good teriyaki bowl (and many other options) then head over to Yogi's. I've noticed the Yelp decal on the front door- love seeing the businesses get involved and proudly display their association with Yelp."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here for a year it so, however, something in the soup made me so sleepy I couldn't sit up up! Almost as though I had been drugged. It was not even 5pm and I had a great nights sleep. Strangely unusual!"}
{"text":"I LOVE their veggie rolls. I like them tempura, which is not on the menu. They are always accommodating and make it just the way I like. Everyone is very friendly, and they remember my order even if it's been a month since my last visit."}
{"text":"This location has been about 5 different Asian food places (probably exaggerating) and none of that have survived. It's about 10 feet away from a chipotle so that makes it tough. The reason why yogis is still here is for a few reasons. For one, the food is high quality and made on the spot. The plates are big enough to fill me up, and the wait for fresh food is short.  The second reason is, it's not as packed as chipotle; and it's clean as heck! Bathrooms are spotless and the dining area is large and clean. The owner is typically working and she keeps the place running. The workers seem a bit intimidate by her and are extremely friendly and helpful because of it.  Overall, love this yogis. Not a fan of other ones I've been to but this one just seems, different."}
{"text":"Great prices, food is always super fresh and yummy! Not a fancy sit down meal but perfect for a quick bite or take out. Service is always quick and friendly!"}
{"text":"As I understand it as they were making my sushi rolls they kept asking... \"What's in this?\" And they would hear back \"who cares?!? Fill it with crab! Crunchy roll? Full of fake crab! Philly roll? Full of fake crab! California roll? Full of fake crab... and a tiny bit of avocado! Worst sushi of my life."}
{"text":"Yogis is great we eat here at least once a month and the staff is always great. They have authentic Asian candies the my son loves to eat and always asks to go to the chicken place. My husband an I always eat the beef."}
{"text":"Good, affordable food and great service. Everyone who works here is so nice and they definitely keep people coming back. I cannot praise their customer service enough. They have great bowls and sushi, also great noodles and eggrolls. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Deeelicios and great portions. Very nice servers and seems like a family run operation"}
{"text":"When I need my soup/noodles fix, I come to Yogi's grill!  I love putting hot sauce onto my noodle dishes.  Their shrimp tempura is so good.  I also love their chicken teriyaki.  It's awesome for lunch.  They have a nice variety on the menu so I often have a hard time picking what I want to have because I want to have a little of each!  It's a terrific option for fast food, which is fast in service but not in quality."}
{"text":"Now that I'm a mom,  I have one tiny bone to pick with this spot. There is no changing table in the bathroom. Not cool people! Mom's go to sushi with babies. Please have a changing table in your restroom. I had to dash out, before my food came, and walk to the public restroom across the street. So inconvenient.  The food was good. I'm new to sushi, so I don't have much to compare it to. The crunch rolls and California rolls were tasty. The presentation leaves much to the imagination. A styrofoam plate isn't exactly what I'd like to eat off of, never mind how it will rot in a landfill until the apocolypse.  It did take a long time to get our food-but this only made me think they took extra care to make it right, so it's not a complaint, just an observation. If you're in a rush, this might not be the right place to eat."}
{"text":"Eaten here twice now, and both times the food and service has been stellar. Tried both the terriyaki salmon and the terriyaki chicken with tempura. The rice is cooked perfectly (rare for a fast counter-service place), and there is a generous amount of meat. The tempura was crispy and tasty. Service is fast and friendly. I can't comment on the sushi because I haven't tried it there. But for terriyaki, it's really good!"}
{"text":"I was sadly disappointed, after reading all the excellent I thought it was shoe in. not so much. Long wait for food then it was just ok. Id rather pay more for food that tastes amazing and doesn't take forever to get."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab a quick bite and feel good about it.  I enjoyed the Teriyaki and rice with all white chicken.  The chicken was grilled perfectly and thoughtfully plated atop a nice portion of rice.  The rice was not overly sticky.     It is easy to miss this restaurant as it is tucked in a corner near Best Buy."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place is great! The food is delicious, the sushi was very fresh, and the delivery man was hot! My boyfriend got the sushi while we were visiting from Massachusetts and said \"I think this is he best sushi I've ever had!\""}
{"text":"Very good food and owners are very polite and welcoming. Definately worth the wait too around lunch time might get a little busy."}
{"text":"Such a great place to get some authentic food! I love it, I go for lunch multiple times a week and get the chicken yakisoba. It's amazing. They have really good sushi too. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken and beef veggie bowl...got a plate with 90% rice... a few strips of meat and veggies.  Asked the lady upfront why a \"veggie\" bowl contained more rice than veggies.. she answered and I quote \"if you wanted only veggies.. you should have asked for \"low-cal then \"! and then walked off.   I quickly scanned the big menu above the cashier and nowhere is this low cal option advertised... also.. if the veggie bowl contains that much rice.. then what exactly is the difference from the regular bowl?   Should have stuck with Chipotle next door... at least with them you know what you are getting"}
{"text":"Very clean, great service! I had the poke bowl, and it was delicious! The sauce was amazing! My boyfriend had the chicken teriyaki. The chicken was perfect, generous portion and the broccoli was cooked just right!"}
{"text":"Went in because it was next door to Best Buy where I was getting some work done on my car stereo. I had forgotten that I ate at a different Yogi's and hadn't cared for it so apparently my memory sucks.   Got a chicken teriyaki bowl and a dragon roll. It was a bit too much food for one person but I made the attempt anyway. The teriyaki bowl was actually pretty good, though there isn't much you can do wrong with teriyaki bowls. The sushi was ok. Not bad but not particularly good either. Over all it's decent for a fast food sushi place. Much better than the other location I ate at."}
{"text":"Not only was the food incredible mind you, but so was the service! My boyfriend and I track our food and Anna was extremely helpful with ounces and portion sizes. Thank you!!! We will most certainly go back."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and I usually get the Chicken Tempura Combo.  I like the variety that comes with the combo and it should fill you up.  Comes in at $10.82.  I think the food is better here than some of the other locations."}
{"text":"BEWARE Peoria residents! This restaurant will not deliver to you. They changed their delivery area and will not tell you til 30 minutes after you order."}
{"text":"Very delicious food made fresh on the spot great food great service. Very clean resturant and restrooms."}
{"text":"Sushi - cheap but ok Teriyaki - good sauce, poor quality chicken  The food is fine for the price. It compares well to the rest of Norterra, but that isn't saying much since the shopping area is filled with below average restaurants and crummy chains."}
{"text":"Nothint spectacular, but I'm a bit of a teriyaki snob being from Seattle.  Still, it's better than Samurai Sam's.  The building is brand new.  Prices and service are about average, and really so is the food.  Still, you could do worse. Probably some of the best chicken teriyaki in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I love me some Teriyaki. Chicken and Rice fill my soul. The owner here is as cute as a button and welcoming beyond words. The chicken was plentiful and nicely grilled. I also munched on a generous Cali Roll. This place is well cared for. I will put it on my regular rotation."}
{"text":"Yesterday Chipotle next door had some free special for kids or something, so I went to Yogi's instead. They cook and prepare things fresh, so it takes a little longer than a fast food joint that has everything pre-cooked. I got the Chicken Udon and Teriyaki Chicken/Tempura combination. Both were excellent.  The Udon is the only Udon around this area.  It's a little pricey, but worth the value."}
{"text":"Yogi's Grill has great teriyaki for a reasonable price. I haven't tried anything else, but the few times I've eaten here , the food has always been fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place two stars but after my encounter today I must.  I normally go to the location on camelback since it's less than 5 minutes from my house but this location is near my job.  I went there today for the first time for lunch.  I normally get the same thing and the food was good but the customer service was terrible! I walk up to place an order and I say \"hi how are you\" and all I get is a blank stare.  After I pay I say \"THANK YOU!\" Nothing.  Then she brings me my food, again \"THANK YOU!\" And the quick turn around and walk away move.  There's no reason to be a bitch!  Quit your job if you hate it so much but I can definitely find somewhere else to eat because there are plenty of options.  If I walk in there again and that little girl is there, Yogi's ain't gettin my money that day boo! Get your attitude in check baby girl!"}
