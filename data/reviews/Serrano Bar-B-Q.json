{"text":"Best chicken sandwich in the area.  When I lived downtown I missed it.

My only complaint is that the last two times I had small pieces of bone in there which was disappointing... So only 4 stars"}
{"text":"Why make rotisserie chicken at home when you can get it here?? I drive all the way from NDG to pick some up, it's that good."}
{"text":"Best sandwich in Montreal, hands down.

I used to live around the corner, which was dangerous, but every time I go back to visit Montreal, I can't pass this place up. I usually get the \"cuisse\" sandwich with coleslaw, onions, tomato, mayo and EXTRA hot sauce. Unbeatable. I finish my sandwich in a haze of ecstasy, and question whether or not I can cram another in me. Also, the sandwiches are huge and cheap. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Great chicken sandwich. I've heard great things about the porc sandwich.. but it seems to sell out by noon."}
{"text":"Excellent chicken sandwiches, probably the best I've ever had. Good price too! I recommend to select the chicken thigh (not the breast). I feel the bread-to-meat proportion with it is just right, it's juicer and tastier. I like to ask for 'all dressed' (including hot sauce) and specify that I want 'chicken broth' as well. They add it for free but you need to ask - and it's even more delicious that way! 

The full chicken is very good too if you want to do a cozy and easy meal at home. I was a bit disappointed however with the potatoes... but the chicken is so good I'm maintaining the 5 stars review :) Cheers!"}
{"text":"I love the chicken breast sandwich! Very friendly people and family-run for 30+ years!"}
{"text":"Chicken sandwich on the go, can't beat it so good taste like Peruvian chicken from NYC."}
{"text":"Good prices. Really nice ladies. Decent chicken and fantastic potatoes. Chicken tends to be a bit dry, need that good auju sauce they have."}
{"text":"Wait, hold up!!

I never reviewed Serrano?, the  go-to place I've been going to for Rotisserie Chicken for decades?

It is simply the best chicken in the Mile-End, giving the Portuguese places a run for their money. Their bird is small but so juicy and more than enough for 2 people.

Get a large scoop of potatoes, ask for a homemade spicy sauce as well as a scoop of chicken drippings, grab a Inca Kola and some bread and have a feast. 

It's not the kind of meal you can eat while doing something else, it requires your full attention as the chicken grease will not allow it.

They do have sandwiches for that quick bite though, but i always go for a full or half bird.

There are many picnic parks and benches in the area, the chicken stays warm for about 30 minutes so it's a good option even if you live far."}
{"text":"Serrano won't impress you with selection or decor, but what it will do is let the food do all the talking.

As a solid affordable lunch option, I've been to Serrano almost once a week for the past 3-4 years. 

If I were to choose between breast and thigh, I break it down to how hungry I am. If I need more sustenance breast is the way to go, if flavor is what you're after thigh is the choice to make.

That being said, I'll throw a curveball in all that and say that my favorite is the pork sandwich. Yes, the pork sandwich from a place known for rotisserie chicken is my go to choice. 

Maybe it's my Filipino heritage clouding my judgement, but the juiciness of the meat with the amazing chicharon-like crunch of the crackling skin is just perfection.

As other have said, no matter what sandwich you take, ask for it \"All Dressed\" with the chicken drippings and the spicy sauce (not overly spicy, I usually supplement my sandwich with some Valentina Black Label hot sauce of my own)"}
{"text":"Not sure what's going on, if the owners have changed or whatnot, but the last three times I went to Serrano of late, the chicken was totally off. Dry and lacking of that yummy \"fill your belly with salty goodness\" feeling. Also, whereas the staff used to be women and there was always an elderly stern looking lady sitting at one of the tables (behaved like the, or an owner, of the place), the last times we went, the staff were comprised of pushy, borderline rude, men. When I ordered an whole chicken, they tried to convince me to take the leftover parts of previously cut chicken, and when I refused, they had attitude. Won't be giving them another shot since this place is really out of my way, and was only worth it due to the great product they used to have. Seriously, my local Metro does much better at this point!"}
{"text":"Got their pork sandwich for lunch. Ask for it with sauce and powder on top, also with tomato and mayonnaise. Very filling but very good."}
{"text":"Cash only but the chicken sandwiches are the best thing ever. The chicken is really good and juicy. Their potatoes are always good because they absorb the chicken juice. Don't get a whole chicken because the best and juiciest parts are the legs and the thighs. The rest is kinda dry."}
{"text":"Love this place for over 10 years.
Great place to get an amazing chicken sandwich or a whole chicken to go.
Staff is always nice and quick.
At peak lunch or dinner time, be prepared to wait but never too long. The waiting is very worth it!
They have a few tables and chairs to eat at and in warmer times they even put some outside.
I often get a sandwich and bring it to Olimpico and sit and eat at their sun drenched terrace with a latte!
Delicious."}
{"text":"Surprisingly surprised by this chicken place located in the Mile-End. Wanting to grab a quick bite before my work shift, I decided to try out this place based on the good reviews found here. I took a chicken sandwich and was very satisfied. The portion is great for the price and is enough to fill you up for a quick lunch. 

However, beware of the insane heat in the restaurant, we had to eat outside as we were sweating balls inside the restaurant, which also happens to only have very few sitting places."}
{"text":"Delicious Chicken Sandwiches here.  

Serrano provides quick service and great prices for chicken sandwiches.  You can choose between chicken breast or legs and they have a variety of sauces.  I picked up a half order of their potatoes and they're equally delicious.

A great place to grab a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Favorite place in Montreal. It was mind blowing. Found it on a whim and it rocked me more than Joe beef and all"}
{"text":"Simply the best rotisserie chicken sandwiches I have ever eaten. And by eaten I mean that my Serrano chicken sandwich consumption probably got close to the three-digit range after four years living in Mile End. Choose thigh meat over breast for a richer, fattier, skin-crunchier experience that is also a few cents cheaper than white meat. Go all-dressed, with salade de chou, and both mayo and hot sauce. There is nothing more to say -- just go."}
{"text":"Best sandwich place to eat in the Mile End. Of couse they're Peruvian! Mile End eats are usually expensive and not that delicious. It's $6 for a thigh chicken sandwich tax included, best deal you will find."}
{"text":"I love Serrano's chicken sandwiches. The leg and the breast are both good, but a mix of both is even better. With all the ingredients and the hot sauce, I would eat there every day for lunch. Haven't tried the potatoes or the pork sandwich. Some day, if I can resist my urge for their amazing chicken."}
{"text":"This, although simple, was a Delicious chicken. Moist, tender,  and extremely flavorful. The roasted potatoes were an excellent accompaniment. I can't wait to return to Montreal."}
{"text":"Leg meat chicken sandwich with everything is the way to go, absolutely delicious! People were friendly and the place was busy at lunch. Great lunch option in the hip Mile End neighborhood. Definitely going to try and go back for another before we leave."}
{"text":"The best known chicken place in the mile end. Their meat is never dry and it is so good. Ask for leg sandwich with extra hot sauce. You will never be deceived."}
{"text":"Serrano BBQ is Montreal's diamond in a rough. People from the Plateau may over hype their Portuguese chicken, and overlook this South American joint. But Serrano is the real deal. Ask to keep the chicken skin in your sandwich if it looks nice and crispy!"}
