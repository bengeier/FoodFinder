{"text":"Just one little suggestion. We'd love to see more vegan and vegetarian dishes on the menu. Right now all they offer is a Mac and cheese with broccoli. There are probably enough vegan beer drinkers around to warrant a few additions to the menu. Nevertheless, this place is a solid hit."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in town.  As someone else mentioned the parking situation is terrible and it can be a long wait.  But, our family of 3 has had good meals (and beer) on every visit.  I've had the sausage and perogies, the sirloin steak salad, my son has had burgers and my husband has had chicken sandwiches.  We'll definitely be back!  Oh, and how can I forget to mention the coleslaw.  The coleslaw is awesome - I even had some with my salad last night!"}
{"text":"Wow did we like this place! We happened in when they first opened on a weekend - I could see how parking could be a problem - but, for us this day - not an issue.  Everyone at our table loved their food - exceeded all our expectations. As we  watched food being delivered around the restaurant -  \"oh does that look good - Oh look at that!\"  The beers were great.  Our server was superior.  I like the vibe - it was the perfect place to watch March Madness.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"We've been here at least 10 times since they opened. Fantastic service and great food. Excellent menu with offerings for vegetarians - which is helpful for us. Awesome beer selection and the staff is very knowledgeable about the very large beer offerings. We've had a couple of large parties here as well and they have been very good about accommodating us."}
{"text":"I think this place is going to make it.  Lets make this clear....parking absolutely sucks and it cant get better.  They have been using a  valet service on weekends but that commits you to a 30-60min wait if one. Summer it wont be bad bc u could walk while u wait or get a drink.   Inside is great, fun good.  Hope it makes it"}
{"text":"Not the smartest management.  They booked a retirement party and accepted reservations on NFL DRAFT DAY!    Beer is great! Food is \"bar food\"...at best"}
{"text":"This place is very disappointing. Barbeque and beer? More like a bunch of deep fried nonsense...and beer.  Their brand of beer is tasty, I'll give them that. But the food leaves a lot to be desired. For starters, I arrived and was greeted by two people at the front counter. Then I waited for about five minutes in front of the sign that said \"Hostess will seat you\"...at which point I asked the two people at the counter where the hostess was...and they said that they are the ones who would seat me. Not sure why I had to wait so long and ask them to be seated.  Then I waited awhile for the server to greet me. Ordered a beer and waited almost 10 minutes for it. When I tried to order wings, I asked the server what \"Spicy Kitka BBQ\" was. She said she has no idea because she doesn't like spicy food. Mind you, they only have 5 sauces...and she doesn't know how to describe the sauce that has a weird name...the one that EVERYONE is going to ask about? Sigh. Ended up getting dry rub with the sauce on the side. Glad I did because the \"spicy\" sauce was very sweet and not spicy at all. Meh. The wings were tasty, but expensive for what you get.  My guest ordered gumbo, which tasted like it came out of a Campbell's can and had been reheated several days in a row. The rice was overcooked and the soup was just plain bland. We only ate about a third of it and when we mentioned to the server that it wasn't very good she just said, \"I've never tried it\". Really? That's how you react to dissatisfied customers? The employees obviously need more training and to learn customer service skills.  So, if you're looking for average beer and below average food, all while being bombarded with 20 big screen tv's everywhere you look, this is the place for you. You'll fit right in with all of the other overweight white people who seem to think this place is worth visiting."}
{"text":"I checked out Brew Kettle for the first time during a visit to Hudson last weekend. My girlfriend and I went in on a Saturday night around 7:30. Most tables seemed occupied. There were 2 open seats at the end of the bar. This is a great place to watch a game as they have a lot of big screen TV's above the bar. I was excited to try the White Rajah on draft and it did not disappoint. We ordered the fried green bean appetizer. It was pretty average. The service seemed pretty average as well, no real issues but nothing that stood out. I'm not a big fan of the atmosphere and set up. Feel like the bar takes center stage and is very bright."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and order the triple pig. The meat is moist, tender and flavorful. Make sure to come with an appetite because it is huge! Very solid beer selection. I went with my family, and everyone enjoyed their food. I tried a little bit of everyone's food (7 people to be exact) and I was very impressed that they can make everything taste great. Fun atmosphere especially if you want to watch a ballgame."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price. Fresh ingredients. Wonderful staff. Nice looking. Might be the best value in Hudson."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I wish I could have given a better review because I love Brew Kettle Beers. On this particular Friday at 4:00 the place had about 3 tables with people at them and maybe a dozen people around the bar. I came in and was able to get a seat at the bar immediately. I already knew what I wanted so I waited, and waited, and waited. The bar tender at one point was staring right at me sucking down her Starbucks. I didn't wave because I figured she should surely notice the 6-4 man with no beverage and a thirsty look in his eye. So I assumed that I was just being missed by her. So I moved to the end of the bar where I was all alone with multiple seats to the left and the right. Again she checked people around the bar completely ignoring me. I finally had to flag her down which obviously annoyed her. Whatever! I finally got my beer with a nice side of attitude. The beer was delicious but the service was garbage."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday.   The bar didn't have an empty seat and the rest of the place was 1/3 full.  The staff was pleasant.  The timing of drinks/food was what is expected.   The place itself is nice and typical of bars in Northeast Ohio.    We had their winter warmer seasonal beer and it was very good!!  Got the stuffed poblano peppers for an app.  You get 2 and they were packed with a ton of chorizo.  You could split the 2 between 4 people for a nice sized taste.  It was tasty and the chipolte sauce it sat in was good.    The entrees were the downfall for us.  I got the margarita chicken sandwich. It's chicken is grilled.  Which can be fine.  But I hate when they grill it and it gets that burnt on edges and in other spots because that's ALL you taste is the burnt!!!  The side of fried green beans was delicious.  Get the side of remoulade sauce to dip them in!  The side of coleslaw-was good.    My hubby got the chicken Parmesan sandwich.  I tried it and thought the chicken was dry and tasteless.  The side of Mac-n-cheese was ok.  Not gritty which is good, but a bit bland.    Since it just opened and we live in town, we'll be back to try some other menu items.  If anything it's good for beer & apps imho"}
{"text":"3/18/18 Cool industrial atmosphere with lots of TVs. Great beer selection. Food is just alright. Had pulled pork sandwich. Good flavor, but not outstanding. Mac and cheese nothing great. Wife thought fish tacos were just ok. Kids chicken part sandwich and other son's chicken fingers just average."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place no stars, but I can't so 1 will have to do. I got food poisoning from going to this god AWFUL place and so did 3 of my friends. I am really warning you now that this place is TERRIBLE and you are risking your life going here. I have been pooping and puking for 3 days straight. The Brew Kettle has SINGLEHANDEDLY slaughtered my digestive system and it will do the same to yours if you go here."}
{"text":"We were very pleased when the Brew Kettle in Hudson finally opened. We went for an early dinner and we were not disappointed. The selection of beers was exceptional and the only issue was deciding on which beer I should order. Being a Lager fan I ordered the \"Woody\" and it was delicious. The food was excellent and was served by a very nice waitress who excelled at customer service. The food was served hot and my fish and chips was excellent. Well done Brew Kettle. Get there early because this place is getting a large following. But if you have to wait check out the bar. Beer fans you are in for a treat."}
{"text":"Brew Kettle Smoked Wings.   If you are ever on death row, this will be your last meal. They are that good! They are served whole: the drumette and the flat attached still. Which makes the meat more juicy and flavorful. Seriously, the dry-rubbed wings are amazing. In fact, the dry rub is so good we talked the waitress into selling us some for home use!  It's a good sign that the second thing I talk about at a brew pub is the beer. Brew Kettle brews a great variety of beers, from IPA's to Scotch Ales to Porters. Plus they serve beer from other local breweries. If you like beer, then you'll be happy here. If you can't decide, no problem: create your own beer flight and enjoy 5 different selections.   Parking can be a little tight here, so keep that in mind. Otherwise, enjoy your wings and enjoy your beer!"}
{"text":"Great menu with very casual creative appetizers & entrees. Lots of micro brew choices to meet diverse palates. Loud music, festive atmosphere. Prob not place to take grandpa or toddlers, but the rest of the fam & friends will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Yay, more beer in Hudson! This place is still relatively new and seemed super nice! The inside was like a really nice sports bar with tons of seating and TVs! I went for drinks with friends, and there were plenty of beers to choose from! They have their own Brew Kettle beers plus beers from tons of other breweries too! We ordered a meat and cheese platter which didn't have the best presentation but still tasted good.  Another positive about this place is that they stay open til 2 AM on Friday and Saturday nights, which is different from most places in the Hudson area, for that reason it's a great place to meet up if you want to stay out late! I plan on going back for a beer sometime soon!"}
{"text":"It doesn't compare to the main location in Strongsville.  Sat in and ordered out, both meals had issues.  The wings I ordered for pick up were all clumpy when it was supposed to be a dry rub, I ended up not even finishing them.  For comparison, I used to go to the Strongsville location on weekly basis when I worked in the area and loved it... nothing bad to say.  Not to mention, all the prices in this location are marked up by a third.  Was really hoping for same pricing and quality of food.  I don't know how often I'll frequent this location with all the other great local restaurants in Hudson."}
{"text":"This is a bar/ restaurant. Modern type theme. We ordered the pulled pork and meatloaf. The menu has a lot of barbecue options even a barbeque pasta. With the pulled pork I got sweet potato fries which you can't go wrong with those and there was no extra charge for them. However for cheese on my sandwich and dipping sauce for the fries there were additional charges. Not mad about it because it is clearly stated in the menu but just a fyi. What we ordered was just okay not that I wouldn't go back but I would try something different if I ever went back. I also am not in any hurry to return. Not bad not great just average."}
{"text":"Meatloaf sandwich is real good. Nice place, much better than most places in the area."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my meal here for sure. It was a game night and the place was pretty full, but even still the service was really quick and friendly. The steak in my salad was cooked reallyyy well and their fries are really good. The decor is very clean and modern and the atmosphere was perfect for dinner. Would definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"This is our favorite go-to eatery. Excellent service and the food is fabulous  Haven't had a bad meal yet!!!  Can't wait to go again .. the beer is good too"}
{"text":"Bar staff were super nice, helped me pick out a Christmas Lager in January which is great,  The vibe is less sports bar more restaurant which is better for people looking for just dinner and a nice local beer."}
