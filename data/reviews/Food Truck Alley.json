{"text":"Want local food truck fare, rain, snow, sleet, or shine? That's what you'll find here. Four trucks inside serving four different local independent restaurant fare. Proper Pig, River Dog, Boca Loca, and a pizza truck serve up your favorites in a spot with murals to mimic a city street. It's connected to the Entertainment Center next door, but you don't need to play to grab a quick food truck bite."}
{"text":"Great food awesome scenery makes u feel like there are actual trucks and ppl are lining up to taste great food lol"}
{"text":"Food is great there, a tiny bit pricy (I think its reasonable, but I travel a bit for work so my input is based upon others that I am there with telling me how expensive it is), good quality food though.

Normally have the burger from the dog/burger joint, very tasty and good value. Had pizza the other day, it was just ok - with the other options available I don't know that I would get pizza again.

I enjoy the area, will go for a taco/burrito next time."}
{"text":"Did not enjoy the selection. The pizza truck lost my order and then acted like it was no big deal. I would not come to this place again unless someone was paying me."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed having a selection.i have gotten a great taco and a great cheeseburger at different times"}
