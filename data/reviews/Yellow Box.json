{"text":"Ordered the Grecco, the YB Special Stuffed plus the Steak and Frank. Wouldn't call it gourmet at all. Was salty, poor quality and not sure when ham became steak.   Pizza 73 is better."}
{"text":"I love love love Yellow Box Pizza.  My favourite would have to be the meaty stuffed pizza.  The assortment of cheese and meats are stuffed into a pie type crust of moist dough.  The pizza sauce has the perfect amount of tang and spice to it.

Joel is a great guy, friendly and loves what he does.  You can tell he takes pride in what he does.  I heard they're opening up a second location in the new year.  I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Not bad but not great.  This pizza is way better then Pizza 73 but is no Nick's.  The ingredients tasted fresh and the sauce had a nice tang.  The crust-we had the regular one- was a little tough but still passable.  The price point was reasonable for the end product."}
