{"text":"Walked in, walked out with an excellent sandwich in about 5 minutes. So affordable. You wonder why you ever pay double for subway. Ordered the sardine bahn mi and couldn't stop smiling. So good. So worth going. I want to eat everything there."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go if i want a banh mi! its super good and cheap, they offer a lot of choices, a selection of bbtea and boxed sushi"}
{"text":"Don't go during the business lunch hour rush. The line will be winding round and round. Never order their non-Viet sandwiches, there's simply not enough demand for them to be fresh. Shredded chicken (#2) ain't so good. Veg not pickled enough. Drinks are way too sweet. It's cheap, people say? Not for the quality you're getting.  On the plus side, they actually have a very efficient system of ordering and their packaging is to be admired."}
{"text":"This unassuming basement shop boasts an impressive selection of drinks, snacks, rice boxes, sushi, and desserts. There are a few small tables in the lower level shop, but if the cafe is full, there's seating outside and plentiful space upstairs.  I ordered a veggie sandwich, taro bubble tea, and coconut tapioca cup. The sandwich was listed as 7\" but looked a little on the small side. The tofu/carrot filling made for a satisfying vegetarian option. The bread was denser and less crisp than the french baguettes I've had at other banh mi shops.  On the other hand, the chewier bread made the small sandwich more filling. Taro bubble tea had great flavor but the cup was stuffed to brim with ice cubes.. reminiscent of Starbuck's volume-filler trick.   Minor complaints aside, Vua is exactly the kinda joint I'd like to make a daily stop in. The selection is wide and the service is fast."}
{"text":"So good. So cheap. I wish I could buy stock in this place."}
{"text":"For the money, it's fantastic. I'm vegetarian, and finding a great sandwich can be tricky. I LOVED their vegetarian sandwich. So freakin' tasty. Also, we got 3 (!!) homemade drinks, as when you buy 2, you get a third free, so we tried a milky iced tea with jelly, lemonade with berries and the sweet basil seed concoction. I loved them all. My husband and I ate well, all fr $12. Can't wait to go back and sample more goodies!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Variety, convenience and enterprising spirit, a rare combination for downtown Montreal imho. Enough said.   Apparently I need to be a little more long winded to qualify as a yelp review. So here you go, more words: Sandwiches, sushi and Vietnamese dishes are made fresh. If it's more than 8 hrs old they give you a 30% discount, i.e. after 6pm-ish! You'd be hard pressed to find that kind of enterprising spirit in Montreal.  Sandwiches are as good and almost as cheap as on Spedina in Toronto, or Bolsa in Westminster/Garden Grove. I've been going to their original location on St. Denis for 5 years and finally I can now go during work hours to this new downtown location. So looks like these guys will not be the typical fly by night deli that plagues la centreville. Bon courage mes amies!"}
{"text":"Cute little place to grab a quick bite to eat. My boyfriend and I came here for lunch the other weekend. It was his first time having banh mi and he ordered the grilled pork. I ordered the vegetarian option. My sandwich came with shredded sautéed carrots and strips of tofu in what seemed like it was cooked with curry paste. It was very enjoyable! We both also wanted bubble tea but the cashier at the time said they were out of bubbles so I ended up just getting an ice coffee slush. My boyfriend ordered a yogurt-based drink with passionfruit jelly. Although both were very good, the next customer who ordered bubble tea was able to get tapioca in their drink. I kind of wish the cashier would have given us the option to hold off a little longer and come out with our drinks. Overall, very good banh mi here."}
{"text":"Had my first banh mi sandwich here today. Blown away! Tried the grilled chicken, was only $5, will be trying the beef next.  Has indoor seating and a terrace :)"}
{"text":"Cheap. Cheap. Cheap. For the price the food tastes fantastic and fills you up nicely. It's perfect for students or for anyone needing something to eat during a quick lunch break."}
{"text":"Conveniently located on St Denis and Maisonneuve, this place is the place to go for inexpensive, fast, yet delicious food. I had a budget of $5 and consulted the MTL Blog for a cheap place to eat that wasn't your everyday sub, and this was the result.  I got the BBQ Pork Banh Mi, and it tasted fantastic. The carrots, radishes, and toasting of the bun were just right. Unlike your average sub sandwich, the banh mi's bun is light and airy but still crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. So much flavor in the bang mi! The only thing I wasn't a big fan of was that the BBQ pork was hard to bite off and chew. I got a small (7-inch) for $3.95, which was perfect for my poor-college-student budget.  Also, the service was great considering how busy they were. They were friendly and quick even though they had to deal with our big group/first timers. In addition to banh mi, they had a variety of sushi and bubble tea to choose from, but I can't say much on those since I didn't order any."}
{"text":"Très bon vietnamien différent choix : japonais, vietnamiens et chinois sans perdre la qualité. J'ai pris un sandwich banh mi 4/5 bon sandwich, Maki été au saumon 3/5 (un peu lourd pour moi), banane tapioca en dessert 4/5 très bon un tt petit peu sucrée pour moi mais excellent.  Endroit a essayer et pas cher"}
{"text":"I ordered a bahn mi with no mayo as I usually do (I even said it twice to make sure the lady at the counter heard and she said okay), but when I brought my bahn mi home and opened it, it was filled with mayo. It wasn't even a busy time of day (maybe one person in front of me in line)."}
{"text":"One of those cases where I got sucked in by just quickly searching for a bahn mi place and only looked at the *stars*. If I'd read more, I'd have found the other two star reviews which mirror my own confusion about why this place is considered good.   Just going by the bahn mi, I'm never coming here again. It's missing all the key ingredients of a good bahn mi. The bread is too large and there's no crispy crust. There isn't enough pickled veggies to add the refreshing crunch. Not that adding more would have helped, they were soft, rather tasteless, and sad. Barely any cilantro either. I'm completely bewildered by how the actual product was so bad considering how many fellow Yelpers seem to like this place.   The only plus is it was pretty cheap. And they sell many other food options like packaged rice/stirfry or sushi meals. Although given the quality of the bahn mi...consume at your own discretion."}
{"text":"Soooo good and cheap! There are many sub options to choose from so you won't get fed up. They also sell sushi and all the little Asian snacks. Can't go wrong with Viet iced coffee either."}
{"text":"I don't always write reviews but I thought this little business deserved one and a good one. As soon as I left the place I thought about writing this review.  Well, it's a place that gives a very good first impression and when you leave it's still the same too. Very welcoming place and people too, very clean, well presented, they basically sell vietnamese sandwiches and it's not that pricey too, I'm vietnamese myself and I've eaten quite a few and for the price, the banh mi are very good, they don't cheap out on the stuffing, it's prepared on the spot and you don't see any sandwiches ready for sell on the counter so you know it's always fresh. You see them prepare your sandwich like at Subways.  They mainly sell banh mi, but they also sell sushi but it's already prepared in advanced and stored in a fridge, there's also bubble tea, iced coffee, vietnamese desert and beverages, they even sell bananas for 75 cent each! Very smart place, you can see where they came from.  There's also a 30% rebate after 9 p.m on some products that need to be sold as soon as possible such as sushi, spring rolls and other stuff I can't remember that cannot be preserved for too long.  In short, this will be the perfect place for me whenever I will need a lunch to go and I don't have time to make it myself!  It's cool to see a vietnamese business thriving and doing so honestly and willingly."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, this was the first place my husband and I came in Montreal.   The banh mi were very solid. I had the beef and he had the pork. The prices are great.   The bread was good, as was the sauce. I would have liked a tangier pickled carrot; the sandwich was a little too sweet and one dimensional.   The pineapple bubble tea was good; very fruity."}
{"text":"They have nice variety of sandwiches which are quite cheap starting at 2.95$  They also have bubble tea, and ice coffee, and pre-made meals including sushi. If you buy a pre-made meal you get a free spring roll!!!  I work close by and sometimes when i don't bring my lunch, this is a good option for cheap lunch.  They also have vegetarian sandwich and spring rolls for those who don't eat meat. We don't have a lot of vietnamese sandwich places in mtl, but this place is fun and has tons of choices... I like it a lot and I go often :)  The place is small but it looks clean and presentable, and cheap too, it's cool."}
{"text":"The sandwich wasn't great, but that's not my top concern. My wallet was stolen here and after being consistently reassured that I would be given security footage, I was not, leaving me without evidence for my bank and out several hundred dollars. Not to mention, the manager told me I was not the only theft at this location and that there had been many at the McGill location. Definitely not worth taking a chance for a crappy sandwich!"}
{"text":"A top choice for yummy food, good prices and super efficient service.  If you go after 9pm you get a 30% discount on most of their food.   Good for packed lunches the next day."}
{"text":"Petit restaurant sympa, dans lequel je retrouve les bons sandwichs vietnamiens! Ils y proposent beaucoup de variétés, avec différents ingrédients! Sympa! Super sympa!    Places dispo a l'intérieur comme a l'extérieur, cependant, les places restent assez limitées!    Ils font aussi des bubbles tea! Par contre ils ne savent pas les faire avec du lait de soja.. Et ils mettent bcp trop trop de glaçons dedans!!"}
{"text":"Best vietnamese sandwhich in the city? Incredibly inexpensive."}
{"text":"This place seems to have the best Banh Mi in Ville-Marie and is on par with the average (not exceptional) places you'd find in California.  The bread is fresh and toasted when you order, the vegetables look like they've actually been chopped on the same day, and the coriander has more leaves than stems.  All that and bubble tea too, or basil seed drink, aloe drink, or other interesting libations if you prefer."}
{"text":"These banh mi sandwhiches are served with fresh bread, meat and vegetables and the price is super cheap. Perfect for a cheap and quick lunch, not to mention how delicious the food is!"}
{"text":"Super fresh, delicious and cheap Banh Mi in the Montreal area!"}
{"text":"Find my review here about the Montreal Sushi joint where the kid sneezed into his hand and continued to prepare my take-out. I tossed the whole bag into the garbage and came into this place, wot I should have tried first. The only thing that was weird, was the checkout line moved WAY fast-lots of people in this place. And no English! A little intimidating, especially as when I checked out, the Credit Card machine decided it was time to piss off. Got the stink-eye from a lot of folks in line,  but I made it. Wish there was a place like this close by in the States. I had: Montreal roll sushi, a pair of Vietnamese cold spring rolls with peanut sauce, and a brownie. All fabulous! And pretty cheap to boot!"}
{"text":"\"Vua\" is the Vietnamese word for king, and this restaurant lives up to that name. I grew up in Toronto, now live in the US East Coast, even ate banh mi in Vietnam - and Vua ranks very close to the top banh mi I've ever had (so take my review seriously because I'm not some clueless American tourist who is new to banh mi).   Service:  very friendly and the Vietnamese staff not only speak Vietnamese, they can take your order in French and English. One day I came in right at opening time and was told by the cashier that sandwiches weren't yet available, but when she saw our disappointment she went back and called the kitchen staff to have them make us sandwiches. What sweethearts! There are a few tables inside near the door, a very small terrasse with some more tables, and a shared indoor dining space with Thai Express (but is located one floor above Thai Express, or two floors above Vua).   General comment: the sandwiches are loaded with liver pate and housemade soy sauce which is how it's supposed to be done in Vietnam. This ain't your typical lazy banh mi shop in North America that uses bottled soy sauce and acts stingy on pate content. This means your sandwich will drip an oozy mixture of mayo and soy sauce so watch your clothing, but don't despair - only the most legit banh mi will drip in this manner. Also the bread gets toasted before all the other ingredients go in, and ends up with a crispy exterior and fluffy interior.   #1 Dac Biet sandwich: Loaded with Vietnamese deli meats, some pate, and priced 50c less than every other sandwich. Amazing value and beautifully balanced flavor with the pickled vegetables.  #12 Liver Pate sandwich: No deli meats here, just a massive gob of pate along with the pickled vegetables. It looks frightening to see how much pate they use, and I was so unbelievably excited when I saw them pack in this amount of flavor.  Side note, after 9pm the prepared foods (usually between $7-8) are an additional 30% off - this includes delicious plates of fried rice, steamed rice with grilled meat, and/or stir fried noodles. They just need to be reheated. Overall, absolutely solid and authentic banh mi shop in a cute and conveniently located neighborhood, I'm sure to return next time I'm in MTL. Last comment (I promise): $5 credit card minimum."}
{"text":"Le petit resto/fast food Vua a été mon endroit fétiche lorsque je terminais mes études à l'UQAM. De bon sandwhich style vietnamien appelé BanhMi ( mes préférés) ou des sandwhich classics ( style jambon fromage) avec petits pain baguettes y sont offerts à un prix plus que raisonnable ,  de 2 à 5 $ ! Il y a éagalements des petites collations comme les chips à la crevettes ( qu'une de mes amies décrit comme étant \"rafraichissante\" , ne me demandez pas pourquoi lol ) ou encore les sushis frais, les pots de fruits, du yaourt style \"vietnamien\", toutes sortes de boissons fruités comme du jus de mangue ou à l'aloe vera ( mon préféré) ! Aussi des biscuits, des boulettes de viandes, des rouleaux impériaux  et j'en passe !   Il y a un peu de tout mais sachez que ceci n'est pas vraiment un resto ou on s'assoit et commande. En fait on choisit nos snacks et boissons et ensuite on fait la ligne pour faire la commande de notre sandwhich et on termine à la caisse. Il y a quelques sièges pour s'assoir et des bancs à l'extérieur en été mais en général c'est plus un truc à prendre pour emporter et déguster ailleurs !   Comme il est situé juste à côté de l'Université du Québec à Montréal, communément appelé ''L'Université du Peuple'' et parce que les prix conviennet au budget de l'étudiant moyen,  ceux-ci  y sont naturellement très présent à n'importe quel moment de la journée et surtout aux alentours de midi !   En tout, Vua est un bon endroit à considérer si on veut juste un bon sandwich fait vite et bien pour continuer sa route !"}
{"text":"Non ce n'est pas la grande gastronomie en terme de cuisine asiatique, mais si vous voulez manger sur le pouce des plats exotiques ou vous rafraichir avec des Bubble Tea, c'est LA place!  Le service est rapide et pas cher, et ça change des sandwichs basiques à manger en 3min sans véritable saveur. Très bien placé, sur St-Denis, à proximité du métro Berri-Uquam!"}
{"text":"Great spot just outside the McGill gates. The banh mi were delicious and cheap, and they also had a huge selection of bubble tea flavours (powder based, but didn't taste too powdery, if you know what I mean.)   The place was super clean with lots of seating, and service was efficient and friendly.   In an area where reasonably priced food was hard to come by, this was a welcome find. I would be a regular if I was a local."}
{"text":"Bubble tea and sushis. What more can you ask for? This place is amazing, oh wait and they also have sandwiches, for cheaper than Subway. I would eat there everyday."}
{"text":"This small shop on St. Denis has some awesome Vietnamese Bahn Mi. You can pick your ingredients from a board with offerings like BBQ pork, shredded pork meat, avocado and chicken. The bread, for a deli, are great and not too crusty. Costs are low and the bubble tea is fresh. Try the mango bbtea!"}
{"text":"Came here as a second food stop in our Montreal tour.   BEST Vietnamese sandwiches I've ever had. I've had Vietnamese sandwiches at places back in New York and one of the things I can't get over is how freaking hard the bread is! SERIOUSLY! It's always cutting the roof of my mouth!   However with VUA's sandwiches- the roof of my mouth was safe. They had a perfect blend of meat, veggies and sauce. If they added anymore it definitely would've overpowered the entire dish.   Not to much it's very price friendly! I totally recommend this place for a quick to go lunch or if you want to sit down and eat. There is seating so no need to rush!"}
{"text":"If you are on a student budget or want to eat affordably, come to Vua!! They have good quality vietnamese sandwiches! The line moves extremely quickly and there are endless options of what fillings you want in your sandwiches. There is seating available for you and your friends to eat! The inside of the store is very clean and if you don't want vietnamese sandwiches, they also offer buns and sushi that is prepackaged already."}
{"text":"Délicieux !!! Tout simplement bon :) j'adore . Il y a plusieurs choix!!!! Plusieurs tailles de sandwichs"}
{"text":"First of all I'm shocked to see it doesn't have a 5 stars. This place is the best!!! I should be their spoke person because I literally tell everyone how amazing this place is. Let's start with the bread, the white bread is freaking amazing and perfectly toasted. The butter they spread on it melts into it and is beyond tasty. They have many fillings to choose from but I have fallen in love with #3, the chicken Banh mi, I haven't ordered anything else since then. The marinated carrots add the perfect crunch and the cilantro brings the right amount of freshness.  Now you've got this delicious sandwich with quality bread+toppings and it's only 5$?! For an 8inch?! Seriously best bang for your buck and it's so close to JMSB I went there all the time on my break. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm not a banh mi expert but I really enjoyed my roasted chicken sandwich and bubble tea. I think my tea cost more than my sandwich (cheap sandwich, not expensive tea). Good value for a quick and nutritious lunch.   The small seating area was clean but quite crowded. I think this will be a good spot to pick up a picnic on the way to the Jardin Botanique when the weather gets nicer."}
{"text":"I grabbed two sandwiches for the first time from Vua few days ago  Well i cannot compare it to other branches but as an experience per se I would not repeat it Here are my observations:  1- The staff were difficult to communicate with. You had to repeat few times and hope they did not get you wrong 2- The grilled beef was not grilled to my taste. This aside I had to try to find the beef from within the carrots that filled my sandwich omnipresently! 3- The bread was rather dry The second sandwich was my wife's. she did not complain! Hers was a chicken sandwich. I tried a bite and was definitely better than mine! They're new maybe they need a second chance. I dis not enjoy the idea anyway and it is not my type of food (seems personal than an impartial review I know)"}
{"text":"Good value.   I always get sub #1, large, def my fav.  Pro tip their sushi is on discount for 30% off after 8pm. Just check w the cashier if they forget the sign.  One star less because sometimes the sandwich is not as scrumptious, or bread a bit old at end of day, but overall consistency is good.  EDIT one star more. I've been here 15-20 times, and I think it's too bad that people decided to rate it so low based on single experience.  Sure I've had bad ones from here like I said above, but these people give you $4 sandwiches for good value. Most of the time they get it right, in my experience."}
{"text":"C'est dans ma tour de bureau, alors j'y vais souvent. Les banh mi (sous marin vietnamien) sont bons. Je prends souvent le #5 ou #7 au porc. Je prends avec pain brun et sans Mayo pour manger plus santé.  Le tout pour 4.90$ taxes incluses pour le sous-marin grand format.   Le midi, la semaine, il y a beaucoup d'étudiants et ils n'organisent pas bien le paiement, alors c'est un peu long, mais rapide pour la quantité de personnes à servir.  Les sushis sont corrects pour dépanner, mais c'est pas leur spécialité. Leur plat de nouilles ou de riz sont bons, mais je ne pense pas qui on peut les chauffer comme ils le prétendent.  Ils ont des smoothies et bubble tea. Leur tapioca n'est pas bon, n'a pas une bonne texture, car pas gardé au chaud.  Les ailes de poulet sont à éviter, il y a juste de la panure. Le pâté de crevette sur canne à sucre est bien, mais quand meme sec.   Ils ont aussi des dessers vietnamiens qui sont corrects, mais je n'aime pas ce genre de dessert. 849670071&source"}
{"text":"Des sandwichs vietnamiens à moins de 6$, nous avons un lunch rapide et plus santé que la plupart des options offertes à proximité. Après 21h, les sushis sont en rabais de 30%. Ils offrent aussi une gamme de desserts vietnamiens si vous voulez essayer."}
{"text":"Cheap Delicious Quick  I've only ever had their banh mi sandwiches because I can truly say I'm addicted to them. I had their vegetarian banh mi one day when I wanted something cheap. I was blown away by how delicious and filling these sandwiches are! I usually grab 2 (one for me and one for the bf) and it amounts to just under $10.00.  I only ever say 3 or 4 things \"Number 14 (vegetarian banh mi - tofu)\" \"Brown bread\" \"Everything on it\" \"Mild\"  And in minutes the deliciousness is brought to the cash.  I guess it's classified as fast food since the whole process is similar to what you'd experience at subway but the taste is far beyond your typical tofu wrap.  Actually this review has me craving one right now..."}
{"text":"The ingredients were fresh, great bbq pork, $1 for extra meat. A meal for under $6. Great cheap eat."}
{"text":"Clean place. Good for sit in or takeout. They have cheap sandwiches. The bread is a little hard but i enjoy the taste. This is one of the best options for campus food, if you're in McGill. Their service is also very fast."}
{"text":"I'm really happy that this place opened up a couple months ago. The McGill campus really lacks good, cheap food options and this new Vua location helps fill that hole. 7\" sandwich is $4.30 and 10\" sandwich is $4.90, both after tax. The banh mi sandwiches are quite filling. I like the grilled chicken and grilled pork banh. 7\" is only available on white bread, but 10\" comes on white and brown. They heat up the sandwiches so they are nice and warm (unlike Vinh's at McGill, where sandwiches are usually cold and sad). There's a portobello mushroom option for vegetarians but I've never tried it. Did try the spinach pastry thing but wasn't a huge fan.  There's a lot more seating and the decor is brighter and warmer than the St. Denis location. However, the St. Denis location is open til 10 while this one closes at 8. I've heard there's a huge line during lunch hour, but if you go in the afternoon or evening it's pretty empty, there might be one or two people in front of you in line. By the way, it's cash only for under $5.  As far as getting a quick bite in this area goes, I think Vua is as good as it gets. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Les prix sont bons, mais il faut faire attention aux protéines choisies... Certaines ont l'air d'être tout droit sorties de la fabrique à hot-dog.  Aussi, ils mettent toujours le même assaisonnement style chinois, tout goûté pareil, ou à peu près. On finit par se tanner, si on y va souvent."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese sandwiches! No matter what I take its always delicious. Even the little sushi's and premade plates. Be sure to try the chicken balls at the cash. They are amazing! Unfortunately they kept bringing the prices up since they got popular and i dont go nearly as much as i used to."}
{"text":"Yum!!! Great little quick bite& worth every cent. Nice little walk from Chinatown.. definitely must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"My friends and I were very impressed with this sandwich shop. This is the best viet sub we've experienced better than any here in Toronto. Sandwiches were well made, fast, and didn't cost too much.  Even though it was basement level the place was professional and well designed. They offer diverse set of drinks and snacks. This place is so professional and well organized that it makes you think it's a chain. Kudos to the owners for creating such a good experience."}
{"text":"This but location is right across the mcgill metro exit off Henri Bourrasa. The first time I tried this chain was on st. Denis and fell in love with this chain for selling sucj affordable bahn mi sandwiches!   I thought this location was a lot less cozy and commercialized. I came around 8 pm, the menu was vast with bubble tea, shakes, sushi and their bahn mi sandwiches. I got the BBQ pork Bahn mi with a side of baked fries. The sandwich was good I always add jalapeños for added depth and flavour- but the fries were microwaved in front of me and tasted old -waste of 2$. I noticed that a lot of their signs for pricing were on post -its-not too appealing.   I think I'm going to stick to the St. Denis  location as my go to."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are very cheap, but sadly my grilled beef bahmi was very dry to eat. The flavor of the meat was lackluster as well. I wish the beef was cooked with flavor. However, a vegetarian would most likely enjoy this place best."}
{"text":"Drunk 3 four lokis, came black out,: dont remember anything but from what i remmeber   bad"}
{"text":"Aaaaamazing. I want to go back, right now.  I ordered a BBQ pork banh mi, I wish they stuffed it with more pork but it was a GREAT sandwich. Even the food stored in the fridges looked delicious and fresh.   The service is quick, the prices are affordable and reasonable, and they have some good deals too. On a nice day, take your food out to their little patio and soak up the sun. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Vua is a convenient, affordable restaurant with GREAT BÁNH MÌ. If you're in the McGill area, I highly suggest Vua over Vinn's.   The decor is modern, and the restaurant is clean and well lit. There is a queue set up, so you order your food and pay at the front. There is a good amount of seating, which is nice to see. There is a refrigerator near the back of the restaurant that has drinks, some salads, snacks and desserts.   I ordered their grilled chicken banh mi and it was incredible! The meat, vegetables and other toppings were fresh (they are busy!), and the bread was soft and chewy. This is a HUGE plus over banh mi's I've had in the past. Usually, the bread leaves something to be desired, but the bread here is ON POINT.   I also bought a grass jelly dessert from their fridge, which was really cheap and delicious. It was a little too sweet for my taste, but it's a great dessert if you have a sweet tooth.   Overall, I love this restaurant and I would HIGHLY recommend it!   PS. You get a discount here if you present them your McGill Association of North American Born Asians' (MANABA) membership card!"}
{"text":"I went to Vua this afternoon for the first time for a takeaway sandwich. I got a 10'' vegetarian sandwich (called the Jardinière) for $5.69 tax included and was very happy about it! The price was the same for all sandwiches, regardless of the ingredients so that was really nice. My sandwich was very well seasoned. I loved that it had hummus and portobello mushrooms in it because there was a lot of flavours going on in that sandwich!  I really loved the variety of options they had, they had a lot of general East Asian food for some reason, which I appreciated. They had some Pocky and lychee jelly at the cashier, they also had a fridge full of takeaway food and desserts like sushi, spring rolls, noodle bentos, coconut milk and tapioca etc etc. It made me very happy.  The staff there was also super friendly too, which made the entire experience 10x better. I'd definitely recommend going there since it's about 3-4 minutes away from Concordia's EV building, it's fast, it's pretty good, and the price isn't expensive either. I'll go back again soon when I need something to grab when I'm studying."}
{"text":"Les employés sont toujours souriant lors de notre arrivée.  Plus de 30 variétés de sandwich (autant vietnamien que canadien).  Essayez les boulettes de viande sur bâton à la caisse. Ils sont excellent! Les sandwich ne sont pas cher et avec breuvage et accompagnement, le prix tourne autour de 7-8$ ce qui est parfait pour diner/souper.  Aussi grand choix de sushi et je vois plein de gens juste commander les smoothies, apparement qu'ils sont bon! Bonne découverte! (ils acceptent Interac si l'achat est de plus de 5$)"}
{"text":"Stopped here today because it was one of the cheaper options around! And it did not disappoint! Even though Banh Mis are supposed to be really cheap, it's hard to find cheap ones here so the price is good for the quality. I got the #5 and my friends got the #1, #4 and #14 and we all loved them! We also tried the Italian soda and it was satisfying too. Love it!"}
{"text":"I think the winning part about this place is convenience.   It's not that good.  It's not terrible, but it definitely comes around 2.5/3 stars for tastiness in the BahnMi department.  This place definitely benefits from its location.  They also make it exceptionally easy to order by number if your french is so so."}
{"text":"30 choix de sandwichs.. 7\" 3.25$ et le 10\" 3.75$ +tx... Que dire de plus c'est bon!! Ils ont des sushis préfait...mais pas super...cependant ils ne sont pas chet ey ça depanne!"}
{"text":"What a great find! Great prices and the Bánh Mì was fantastic. I recommend the #15 spicy pork. The bubbly tea was good but very sweet. I could only drink about half. I usually only drink water or unsweetened tea though. Under $9.00 for both."}
{"text":"One of the best in and out vietnamese sandwiches places. Couldn't tell you about their whole  menu. The Vietnamese sandwiches quality and selection is as good as it needs to be for the price. Staff don't waste any time."}
{"text":"Shredded chicken sandwich had great flavor, but the bread to meat/veggies ratio was way off (and they completely left out chilis!).   Next time I'm getting a 10\" and am Titanic-ing the contents to give me a meaty 5\" banh mi."}
{"text":"Ordered a 10\" vegetarian bahn mi on brown bread and that is what I've got. Inexpensive and quick service which is perfect for students. Their new location couldn't have been better!"}
{"text":"Great food. I went and got a 10-inch Banh Mi for less than 5$. Tasted great! They also have other stuff, such as fried rice and sushi rolls, although those are prepackaged and slightly pricier. They have lovely decor with bright, vivid colours that really give a trendy vibe to the place. The shop is actually pretty small, though, so there are only a couple tables to sit down at.  (fyi they only accept credit for purchases of 5$ or more)"}
{"text":"I LOVE Vietnamese fast food! This place has all the basic Vietnamese snacks like nem, banh beo, che (sweet bean drinks) for such a reasonable price. They also sell Vietnamese coffee for only 2.95 or something around that price and bubble tea. Their sandwiches are their signature products. The Saigon Dac Biet is my favorite, with pate, ham, and pork...so delicious. There's also an amazing vegetarian one as well. All their sandwiches are good actually, it's not a hit or miss kind of thing, though I recommend getting the Viet ones not the regular \"Western\" sandwiches. Their sushi is mediocre, I wouldn't go there for sushi for sure. They also have cakes and pastries here and there. Service is decent and there's a great lounge upstairs on the top of Thai Express that is nice and quiet (if you like that kind of ambiance and prefer noiseless areas than the main dining area) This is my ultimate food spot when I hit St. Denis street. A definite must try!"}
{"text":"Cheap sandwich for its size and considering the location. nice selection of sandwiches, although only 2 veggie options, so vegetarians might not like to frequent this establishment very often. Way better than subway and the likes. The bubble tea was ok. Big line at lunchtime, but not too long of a wait considering how big that line was.  They also have a fridge in the back with some sushi boxes. Good option for cheap take out."}
{"text":"I don't know, sometimes I really like this place and then other times it just gets a \"meh\" from me. I've tried a few of their sandwiches, their classic bahn mi, and their chicken bahn mi; as well a number of the fresh spring rolls, sushi, and a couple of their desserts. The food is pretty good for what it is - it strikes a balance between authentic and catering to the masses. I usually like the texture of the baguettes used for the sandwiches and bahn mi, and that you can customize what you want to garnish it. It's not somewhere I'd go out of my way to try, but I suppose it's a good option when you're in the area and don't want to spend more than $10."}
{"text":"I usually go to the St Denis location beside the Grande Bibilotheque, and it's really good. So I was passing by this one downtown and decided to get a bubble tea. I ordered the Taro with tapioca for $4.50, basic as far as Bubble teas go and there wasn't a huge line at 6pm so she could have taken her time, basically I got a watered down tea with maybe a half a scoop of that powdered goodness they normally put in. I wasn't feeling it, it barely had any ice either so it was warm too, disappointed Vua..Luckily I told the  the guy working there and he offered to make me another one no charge! Thanks dude..I'll be back for sure!! Great customer service!"}
{"text":"I ordered the grilled beef Banh Mi sandwich and a spring roll and I received a completely different meat inside, looked like minced pork. I don't eat pork and i was very disappointed. In addition, the spring roll was not hot whatsoever. Not going back"}
{"text":"Nice vibe: very clean, lots of windows. We got there right at 9:00, and they got us banh mi in plenty of time to catch the train. I had ham, and my wife had the beef, which seemed like a corned beef hash consistency. It was good overall, though possibly a little dry."}
{"text":"Last time they gave me less meat on my sandwich so you're lucky to get 2stars bc I like to eat.. Be NICE to touristy yelpers!  Just go to Toronto Banh Mi Boys for the real good stuff..I'm going there next (very meaty)."}
{"text":"First discovered Vua at St-Denis, but i was more than happy to find out that they opened a new spot near Mcgill! The interior is really nice, a lot bigger than the one at St-Denis.  Their banh-mi are seriously the best, especially for such an expensive price. There is even a vegetarian option and it is actually super good (i ordered it although im not vegetarian). Their spring rolls are also super tasty, and their sauce goes so well with it. Their desserts are typical viet desserts and it can look weird but its so freaking good!   The only con is probably the fact that they dont have the buy 2 get 1 free for drinks and desserts like at their St-Denis store :("}
{"text":"Thank you Vua for feeding me during my uni years!!! I always get either their #1 or the BBQ pork, no cilantro (pls no shame) and extra avocado ($1). If you like avocados I recommend the extra, it really ups the flavor! Even when they're busy the service is quick and friendly and they've only gotten my order wrong like once in my 5 years frequenting this place but I'll take partial blame for not liking cilantro eheh"}
{"text":"Franchement c'est un grand 5/5 pour Vua. Quand je n'ai pas apporté mon lunch entre deux cours, c'est toujours toujours ici que je vais !  La nourriture est vraiment bonne aussi bien leurs sandwichs, suchis ou plats chauds. La dernière fois, j'ai pris un plat nouilles Soba au poulet. Le poulet était tendre, les saveurs disctinctes et la serveuse m'a offert un rouleau impérial qui lui aussi était bon ! Les sandwichs sont délicieux, mention spéciale pour le poulet grillé et celui aux boulettes de viande et le tout pour un peu moins de 4$ (taxes inclues).`  Les prix sont parfaits pour des budgets étudiants, on ne fait jamais la queue plus de 10 minutes même en plein coup de feu. A l'étage, il y a toujours de la place !  En un mot, Vua, j'adore !!!"}
{"text":"Coup de coeur ! (oui, tu as bien entendu, un gros coup de coeur même)  Nostalgique de la cuisine vietnamienne de ma mère, j'avais vraiment envie de (re)goûter au fameux banh mi comme je les aime.  J'avais entendu parlé de Vua Sandwich, sorte de fast-food vietnamien. Il fallait donc que j'y fasse un tour pour avoir mon premier avis là-dessus. Près du métro Berri-UQAM sur la rue Saint-Denis, le restaurant est ma foi un peu caché : il faut bien apercevoir le panneau !  Le truc, c'est que vous avez le choix, mais vraiment : banh mi donc, d'autres variantes, des entrées variées (rouleaux impériaux/printaniers), sushis et des desserts typiques vietnamiens gourmands. Sans oublier les boissons.  Quand tu croques dans ton banh mi, c'est un bouleversement pour tes papilles gustatives. Tu distingues bien chaque ingrédient concocté soigneusement dans ton sandwich. J'ai été vraiment bluffé : il faut bien prendre son temps pour savourer et apprécier ton plat.  Et la cerise sur le gâteau : des prix vraiment attractifs et défiant toute concurrence, pour des étudiants comme moi! Pour le banh mi le moins cher, comptez moins de 3$ (taille régulière) et 3,75$ pour la grande taille.  Le service est rapide et efficace. Il vous prépare votre commande sous vos yeux (un peu à la manière d'un Subway) tout en ayant le sourire. Excellent point là dessus.  En revanche, l'intérieur est très petit. On peut manger sur place, mais je vous conseille de prendre à emporter, ce sera plus simple.  Clairement, on mange à sa faim, et ce n'est pas pour me déplaire."}
{"text":"Yummm! I have been here before and it was ok.This time ..omg the bahn mi is so good..the bread toasted the veggies crunchy and fresh.I was quite hungry so this hit the spot seriously.They have premade noodle dishes and snacks in the front as well.Cheap..yummy food."}
{"text":"Working downtown has its perks but looking for affordable options is quite a hassle. This is where I came across this place on my walks and had their #14 veg bah mi and to my surprise, it was delicious and filling. I didn't know about this place till today i decided to give it a try. I'd definitely check them out for other flavours as well."}
{"text":"Not the best banh mi I've ever had but the sandwiches are delicious and have some complex flavours. I thoroughly enjoyed them!"}
{"text":"The fired noodles or rice is cooked then placed in the fridge.  You need to microwave it to heat it up.  I was expecting it to be cooked on the spot.  The Banh Mi is good though."}
{"text":"The bubble tea was excellent! The service however, was not. I found it pushy, rushed, abrasive, and incredibly rude. Their way of dealing with English speaking customers is to bark at them until they leave with their order.  You certainly won't be receiving any of my money ever again."}
{"text":"I found this place on a list of great cheap eats. It was OK. Banh Mei was good but not great. This is fast food, nothing special. A sandwich and spring roll $9. Fine in a rush for cheap, don't take to impress"}
{"text":"Such good sandwiches! My newest food craze. Was somewhat busy when I went for lunch at 1 but the service was fast. Great value for what you get."}
{"text":"If you love bahn mi this is the place for you. I had the classic 10 inch Saigon for under 5 dollars--Just delicious. The place is clean and the staff is polite."}
{"text":"So good! For a cheap eat, come here! You can get a bahn Mi 6 inch or footlong for a great price. Not into a sandwich? There's a boatload of other options: sushi, salads, etc. There's an outside patio and indoor seating, so take your pick. This spot is popular with students, hipsters, business peeps, families, and tourist. Get here before it becomes an artisan cheese shop."}
{"text":"Quick, good food at decent prices?  Come here!  It's like a cafeteria style place, order, slide your tray down and pay.    I ordered the vegetarian version of their banh mi (got it spicy) and it was delicious and filling.  I did takeout as this place is quite packed around lunch time.     The only small issue is the menu board is placed where you can't see it when you are in line  so if you aren't sure what you want you have to go and look at it and then get into line.  It would be more efficient and less crowded if you could see it while standing in line."}
{"text":"Vua Sandwichs is a unique, unassuming Vietnamese restaurant on St. Denis.  They offer take-out style Vietnamese sandwiches, sushi, salads, side dishes and beverages.  The restaurant itself is clean, well let and has seating in both the cafeteria area and upstairs.  The Vietnamese and regular sandwiches start at 3$ each for a 7\", and 3.50$ for a 10\".  There are enough vegetarian options between the sushi, salads and sandwiches.  Most of the cooked, Chinese style food had fish or meat in it.   Vua offers lots of discounts on bulk purchases such as buy 5 pieces of sushi, get 1 free and buy 3 sandwiches, get 1 free.  These are great options for catering and parties.     There are lots of beverage options including aloe drinks, bubble tea, Vietnamese coffee, both hot and cold and smoothies.  If you're looking for cheap, quick and fresh food near Berri-UQAM, then this is a great choice."}
{"text":"Do in Canada Vietnamese sandwiches It was A-OK  I just can't get into the Vietnamese sandwich thing. I don't know what it is. My friends say that it's because I haven't actually had an amazing bahn mi experience, and I guess I would have to agree.   Vua is like a Subway/Chipotle for Vietnamese sandwiches. They are decently priced, decently sized, weakly stuffed, and are the same price as a drink here (approximately $5-6). The bubble tea is ridiculously sweet... not sure if that's a complaint or not...  I did what had to be done: Bahn Mi in Montreal, but I wish it was better. Le sigh."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat on a budget. Sandwiches range from $4 to $6 for a 10\". They are quite filling and very tasty. They have options for ban mi and more Western style sandwiches, both brown and white bread. Huge variety of options (they have at least 30 different sandwiches and all are quite good).   However, the bubble tea is a bit lacking, despite being cheap. They have a number of takeout dishes and extra food items that are quite good. The iced coffee is great as well if you like Vietnamese style coffee (very strong but smaller portion with condensed milk, lots of ice).  Plenty of seating available and very nice staff. Tends to have a line during lunch on weekdays but moves very quickly. Highly recommended for anyone that wants a casual, cheap place for sandwiches! They also have a loyalty stamp card. If you fill it out, you get a free large sandwich and a coffee, which is a really amazing deal!"}
{"text":"The grilled chicken is definitely my favourite sandwich. Juicy, fresh and cheap. You got me vua. I seriously eat it way too often do yourself a favour already and go get it."}
{"text":"This place is magnificent. I'm vegetarian and there were plenty of delicious sandwich options, all for about $3.  If you're going veggie, I would get the vegetarian chay on the Banh Mi menu - it is more flavorful than the avocado (my husband got the avocado - and I won.)  It's deli counter service, but there's a patio and some seating indoors.   Great location too. Right across the street from the National Film Board. Great for a sunny day and a walk on St. Denis before a movie."}
{"text":"They put very little meat in their sandwiches and they taste just okay. Bubble tea is way too sweet."}
{"text":"I avoided Vua for a long time because it looked so much like a chain restaurant.  I was expecting the Vietnamese version of Thai Express or Sushi Shop. Turns out I was wrong and it's actually just an independent shop that clearly aspires to be the Vietnamese fast food franchise chain of note.  At first I thought I arrived in a convenience store (and in some ways it is), but they also have a deli counter where I ordered a Saigon style 10\" Bahn Mi. Their ten inch sandwich was too much for me, next time I'll stick to the regular size.  My sandwich was ready mere minutes after ordering.  The staff don't slack, they can get really hammered during lunch time and at $2.95 a sandwich, volume is where their profits lie.  Most of the interior is lined with shelves and refrigerators bursting with an impressive assortment of ready made Asian goodies.  It spans from Banh Mi of course to Sushi and Bubble Tea, and lots and lots of imported snacks and drinks.  If you need an Asian fix, but Chinatown is too far away, Vua might satisfy your cravings. They even have a few tables near the entrance and a small terrace for customers.  I'm not really an expert on Vietnamese sandwiches, but I have had the real thing.  While not as good as the original, they do serve up a reasonable facsimile.  Is there better Banh Mi in Montreal? Probably, but sometimes it's all about location and Vua is in an incredible spot, and at $2.95 you'll not find a cheaper lunch in the area."}
{"text":"The BEST damn Bahn Mi I've EVER had. Un-freaking-believable. I am smacking myself I couldn't bring home a ginormous cooler full of these Vietnamese sub-like sandwiches and freeze them: One for each day. For the rest of my life. If there's extra room, I'd bring home double the amount. For breakfast. This quite possibly is what I'd ask for for my last meal on earth. At least an extremely close second.   Got their small Grilled Chicken Bahn Mi. Extra protein ($1 extra) and avocado ($1 extra). Excellent sandwich. Seriously! The sauce they use, well I forgot to ask the kitchen staff, but it was to die for. I'm having trouble describing it, so just go check it out yourself.  A few seats on their outside patio. Wonderful for people watching - man, do Montrealers love their outdoor spaces! Not very big on the inside, but their's more seating in the fast-casual joint right above them.   If I could do a UYE for my Columbus peeps here, good gosh I'd do it in a heartbeat. ROAD TRIP!!"}
{"text":"Pour une pause entre midi et deux, c'est l'endroit parfait.  Ils font des spécialités vietnamiennes comme les banh mi mais j'ai préféré goûter aux sushis.  Les sushis sont en libre service et sont plutôt bons. Pour accompagner j'ai choisi une salade de crudités et je n'ai pas pu finir.  J'ai également pris un bubble tea fraise banane mais sans bulle de tappioca. Pas mauvais mais pas fou non plus. Les prix sont raisonnables.   Je ne sais pas si c'est la radio que l'on entendait dans le restaurant mais j'ai aimé toutes les chansons. Une bonne ambiance."}
{"text":"Holy scheisse, this place has high reviews. I pray none of them are for the Vietnamese sandwich, which was by far the worst banh mi I've ever tasted.  An array of Vua's 10\" Vietnamese sandwiches are $2.95 after 9pm. What a steal! They won't toast them, though, because apparently they turn off the ovens by then. The sandwich is already pre-assembled and bagged so you can be in and out in under a minute.    We went with the classic. Unfortunately the sandwich was terrible - did they put onion gravy in it??? There was an excess of something cloyingly sweet and sticky that is completely foreign to all my banh mi endeavors. The pickled veggies inside were mushy and tasteless instead of providing crunch or tartness. The bread, of course, was spongy and cold but didn't seem like it'd hold up as toasted baguette either.   If there was pate in it -sigh!- then it was swallowed up by the strange gooey sweetness. Quebec, of all places to ruin a pate!   I had neither high nor low expectations for this place - just hungry! but the banh mi was just a huge disappointment on all fronts besides price.  Come here if you just want to be full; 3 bucks for almost a foot of sandwich is a sweet deal. But if you actually know what banh mi tastes like, avoid avoid avoid Vua's offerings."}
{"text":"I had this place bookmarked for a cheap spot to eat, and I finally got to try it when I was on my way to the Old Port and knew food wouldn't be cheap there. Holy cow how the hell is a 10\" sandwich under $5 here? And it was so good!!! I had the BBQ pork with jalapeños. Usually I don't like bahn mi but this place rocks!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Delicious, fast, Vietnamese sandwiches for only $4-5? I was only in town for a week and came here twice because it was so good. Both the grilled chicken and pork sandwiches were fantastic.  They're really busy on weekdays around lunchtime. Less so closer to evening time. Either way the wait is never more than 10 minutes. Their system's very efficient - the first employee will take your order and send it down an assembly line to be ready for you as soon as you pay! They also offer dim sum type snacks, and other Asian foods like noodle soup, but 90% of people stick with the sandwiches. They also have milk tea, but I did not get the chance to try it.  Conveniently located right across the street from Mcgill, so lots of students get lunch here. Very clean, nice place. Wish they opened a shop right across from my college!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of banh mi in my lifetime.  And banh mi really varies with preference and what 'region' of Vietnamese food you're most familiar with.  I was a bit skeptical given the lukewarm reviews and the McRestaurant feel of this place (it's like a Subway if Subway did banh mi) - also, it's by all the bars on St.-Denis so they aren't exactly serving a picky audience -- but decided to give it a go.  Welp - I liked it.  It ticked the major boxes for me: 'chewy' baguette with a rich mouthfeel.  What was very unusual for me was that they used garlic butter in their house special, which really adds to the flavour.  I could see some people finding the garlic intrusive though.  Definitely not the best I've had -- but probably one of the better banh mi spots I've go to in North America."}
{"text":"After three days of limited vegetarian options in Montreal (let alone GOOD vegetarian options), I trekked in here waiting to be disappointed. Never happened. This was probably the best sandwich I've had in my life. Ingredients were super fresh, including the bread which was perfectly crispy. The sauces they used definitely also MADE the sandwich. I also tried the veg spring roll (?) by the cash register. Good, but the sauce they give you with that is way too sweet/fruity. Really above all other details, there's: I got my first sandwich here on Sunday morning. Finished it before getting on the metro. Spent 8 hours thinking about it. Came back to Berri UQAM, got two more. (One for \"dinner\" and one for when I was back home.) Service was also very nice & fast both times I went in there. I can only hope a version of VUA opens up in Brooklyn soon."}
{"text":"Love the bahn mi and love the prices!  Also, the people who work there are nice and it is clean! The only thing I could ask for is more room for customers but I love it here, so I can easily look past that."}
{"text":"I've gone to Vua a few times since my earlier review of this place and finally purchased my 11th sandwich which meant that my 12th sandwich would be free. Connected to Montreal's \"underground city\", it is very convenient for me to stop off there for lunch.  Line-up to place my order was a bit long but the line moved very fast.  I ordered the #1 sandwich 10\" (which is what I normally order) and asked her to make it spicy. I've had their spicy sandwiches before and it isn't too spicy. They basically put 2-4 spicy peppers in the sandwich. As mentioned in my earlier review, it doesn't make a difference if you get a smaller 7\" sandwich or a 10\" sandwich. Both receive the same \"check-mark\" on your loyalty card.  What surprised me about the 12th free sandwich is that it also comes with a Vietnamese ice coffee. I'm not a big coffee drinker but I really liked the free ice coffee that was included. So with the 10\" sandwich and the Vietnamese ice coffee, I didn't have to pay anything for my lunch.  I'll be back to this place again and get another loyalty card to fill out."}
{"text":"I'm giving them 4 stars only cause of the price point. I wish there was more meat but I get it. Sometimes the bread is really stale and they mess up orders. All the sandwiches look the same. Double check. I can eat two sandwiches easily. Overall though it's good unheavy but filling sandwich for price point. And there's a burger king next door always empty"}
{"text":"Got a TON of food from this place: chicken banh mi, chicken wings, two avocado/cucumber sushi boxes, sesame ball, shrimp spring roll, chicken spring roll and a basil seed drink.  Stingy with chicken banh mi but very flavorful & fresh ingredients.  Loved the sauce they put in it.  I've had better in NYC though.  Chicken wings could use more flavor but at 30% off, what's the problem.  Same applies to the sushi.  They also water down their soy sauce tremendously to the point of almost no flavor.  Sping rolls could also use more flavor.  I've made better at home.  Peanut sauce is helpful with flavor but again, could use more bang.  Sesame ball is better at dim sum.  Loved the basil seed drink.  Not too sweet with a bit of chewy crunch.  Yum.  Fed two people dinner and breakfast for $20, what's the [big] problem?"}
{"text":"Sandwich was good but service was terrible. Went there during rush hour (6:30pm) on a weekday and expected to be in and out. Lady preparing the sandwich was nice and seemed to understand english. Except when she messed up my order, she got really sassy with me, grunting and rolling her eyes. Really did not appreciate. The cashier didn't even apologize for her behaviour. It felt like they were blaming me like I changed my mind, when my order was VERY clear from the start."}
{"text":"I made a bad choice of going doing lunch time. It was so packed. However, the sandwich was good we had the number 8 with extra onion. This by far was the star. The sauce that was used on the sandwich is what really set the sandwich off. We also had chicken and beef meatball, veg spring roll, pork spring roll, and the spinach patty.  Best sidekick goes to the spinach patty. The patty was so flaky and moist. I can go there just for that . The other side was just ok and I most likely would not get them again."}
{"text":"I first discovered Vua when hunting for a catering for 100 person call center lunch.  I was getting tired of greasy cardboard pizza and demanded for the lunch budget instead. I first tried Dagwood's with some success but when I ordered Vua grilled chicken sandwich. It was game over.  Vua was an instant hit!!  Agents raved about the sandwiches. That was back in 2010.   I've been a faithful Vua-er ever since. There's been some changes the last several years but I can't ascertain.  Maybe in the beginning it was more family that were running the store because it felt like every sandwich was made with TLC. Case in point, recently, I got 3 large grilled chicken sandwiches to go and two were good. I took the third one to work for lunch with the intention of making my lunch mates jealous (muahaha) but joke was on me cause when I opened up the sandwich, the only thing staring me back was baguette and chicken with 0 trimmings. See my photo.  No love for my sandwich at all (T_T) I also always get 3 basil drinks (buy 2 get 1 free) They're like bubble tea but healthier!  The basil seeds hydrate like chia seeds and are so addictive to try to chew!  One cup had moldy tasting basil seeds which was really disappointing.  I couldn't drink it.  So again, it seems like the quality was 2 hits for every 1 miss.   Dear Vua owners, if you're reading this, I'm still very sad about my sandwich and drink.  I've been a loyal fan for the last 6 years but recently it's been disappointing."}
{"text":"Totally unexpected little fun place. Keep an open mind and take this place for that it is...an quick in and out affordable eating option with a hint of Asian exotic taste.  Absolutely love the price of the bah mi and fun appetizers and snack options! For few mins I felt like I was in another country. Gotta love it!"}
{"text":"The one on St Denis is better here is why: The carrots are not as marinated and are kind of dry, you can tell the toppings have been there for a while, starting to change color and dry out. (carrots) and the sandwich lady was kind of rude. also, the  bread is not as fresh"}
{"text":"I went to the one on University, near McGill metro. I really like the decor, the options are varied. It's interesting how most of the hot entrees are in the self-serve refrigerated shelves with the sushi. There is a microwave in the shop where you can heat up your food if you're eating on the spot.   The price-quantity ratio is what I found Vua does best. The sushi is also nice and soft, unlike the cardboardy dry texture and taste that a certain other sushi chain tends to offer from their ready-to-eat boxes.  But the flavors arent aaaamazing as far as asian cuisine comes. This is a great affordable and tasty meal on the go type of place, a healthier fast food option. Overall I like!"}
{"text":"Best banh mi ever The bread is incredible Cheap and large sandwich"}
{"text":"Vua Sandwiches is one of the best places in Montreal to grab a quick and cheap bite. This place is famous for its Bánh Mì sandwich, which costs around $3.50 on average.  Located close to the Berri metro station, it caters to the population of frugal UQAM (university) students in the area.   The quality of the sandwiches are quite good despite the low price. The ingredients were pretty fresh, and they don't skimp out on ingredients. It's undoubtedly a great bargain for its price.  There are also other Asian snacks (such as pre-made sushi, etc.) and drinks in the store, although these tend to be much pricier than the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Ma 2e maison à côté de l'école. Pour vrai les sandwichs vietnamiens sont succulents. Les sushis ne sont pas toujours méga frais mais quand il est passé 21h et qu'ils sont à 30% de rabais on aime ça!! Un service rapide et endroit sympathique"}
{"text":"lord jesus itsa fire!  the food is grrrrd!  y'all hungry? go eat there!  extra nem nuong sandwich!? all dressed!? hell yeah!"}
{"text":"Cheap. Fast. Delicious. The banh mi was awesome. Carrots and radishes were pickled ever so tart. The bread was toasted to perfection. They also had sushi and other goodies if sandwiches aren't your thing. My only complaint is that the tapioca pudding (che) wasn't of the consistency that it's suppose to be. It was very thick and kind of fell apart. It's suppose to be smooth and creamy but the fault in dessert won't keep me from coming back for their awesome sandwiches."}
{"text":"Not too bad. Nice little Viet shop that allows you to buy pre-made food (i.e. spring rolls, grilled chicken w/rice, desserts, spring rolls).  Cheap and large sandwiches (2 sizes - 7\" and 10\"), but I thought they were just average.  I ordered the grilled pork sandwich.  The bread they use is thicker than I prefer (bc it takes up more stomach space!), they put on more mayo than I prefer, and the grilled pork was just average.  Eggrolls are NOT good, so don't order them.  I had no issues w/service, but I also am Vietnamese and am just used to Vietnamese service, which can be curt and to the point."}
{"text":"Coming from California, I wasn't sure if Vua could compare to some of the authentic asian food featured in California. However, Vua tastes just as good, if not better. The staff that makes the food only really speak French. But, not to worry: All the cashiers speak excellent English! I recommend the #7 (BBQ Pork)  Banh Mi Sandwich. If you're willing to spend  few extra bucks, pick up some egg rolls when you check out. They're some of the best in Montreal and worth it..."}
{"text":"This is like probably the best food-court style restaurant I've ever been to, short of those of some corporate cafeterias on the west coast. The food is cheap, delicious and comes in decent portions. Like not amazingly delicious, but tasty enough that I wouldn't mind coming once or twice a week had I not been on a stricter diet. On top of everything, they're clean and quick. It's like some enlightened Asian McDonalds.  The sandwiches are the mainstays of their menu, but I particularly also enjoy the sides. The meatballs are cheap, probably possess a decent amount of protein and taste great (though some of my friends don't like them). They also have some drinks; bubble tea or other jelly type drinks."}
{"text":"This place is legit one of the best places to get food for the cost. (Large sandwiches are less than $5). Not even a big fan of banh mi but their Saigon sandwich and bbq pork are too good. Great for students and lunch breaks. They're opening up a new one soon!"}
{"text":"Great place. Quick, efficient, cheap and quite good.   I've never had Vietnamese Bahn Mi so I don't have a reference point. I will say that their vegetarian sub with tofu, carrots and mushrooms was incredible. Flavourful, not too dry and grilled to the right temperature.   The service was really quick and polite.   If you're looking for a quick lunch - this is your place."}
{"text":"The \"banh mi\" and Milk coffee are perfect together. And in the summer, they even have  Vietnamese-styled \"Banana ice-cream\". If you are Vietnamese, you'll know what I'm taking about"}
{"text":"Cute, well situated restaurant which does make it very busy during lunch hours, but fortunately the service is fast. Food is good, nothing incredible, and the prices are not bad for the neighbourhood. It would be nice if the vegetarian option was available without mushrooms, but that's just me being picky."}
{"text":"The food gets all 3 stars here. Diners have over 10 choices of Vietnamese sandwiches and about as many North American sandwiches. They come on your choice of white or wheat, 7\" or 10\" bread, that is perfectly toasted upon request. The fresh vegetables and herbs complement the sandwiches in taste, texture, and aethestics; it's just not a real Vietnamese banh Mi without them all! Vua's use of red onions instead of white ones was different than what I'm used to but added an unexpected dimension of flavor.   As for the service, I could blame our order complications on language barrier, but by this time we had been in Canada for over 4 days and nowhere else did we experience such an utter collapse of communication--and here  we had 2 out of 3 languages to pick from (Viet, English, and French)!   All I wanted was a Xiu Mai sandwich. Hubs ordered the grilled beef and 2 smoothies with Boba. I opened the bag to find the BBQ Pork, which is my fault for assuming the girl knew which pork sandwich I was referring to when I said \"Xiu Mai\". His sandwich was full of nem, the red patties, so neither sandwiches were exactly what we ordered but we have no food restrictions to stop our hunger. They called us to get our smoothies, which had no Boba (yes, we paid the extra charge to add them), but this was an easy enough fix.   The sandwiches were good, if not accurate, but it just didn't quite hit the XIU MAI spot, so we ordered 1 to go. I ordered it as \"Number 6\" this time and watched the lady make it. I must've turned to attend to my DD at a crucial moment bc two ladies walked off with the sandwich, but luckily one came back to return the one with \"6\" written on the bag. Once we got back to the hotel, I glumly split the sandwich with DH, and hoped that the person who got my Xiu Mai sandwich was enjoying it more than the marinated beef I was stuck with."}
{"text":"This is a combo quick mart style sandwich shop. They make fresh banh mi sandwiches-2 sizes. Lots of choices for them! These were so good!  The baguette was fresh and chewy and the ingredients were also so fresh and the dressing was fantastic!  Just enough to flavor but not drown out the other ingredients!  Perfect for a quick bite!  We may eat here again this week!  Just 5 minutes from our hotel!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a highly-rated cheap lunch place on here, and Vua came up! No regrets here, this was an amazing banh mi, I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Found this gem through reviews on Yelp and I am so glad I did. This place offers great sandwiches that tastes authentic enough for us to visit this place twice while we were in the area. I got the grilled chicken since you can never go wrong with grilled chicken and I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Hey Hey, it's the SAMMIES!  Super Yummy here number 1!  The samiches are good, two sizes too, 7 and 10 inches. Well made with decent french bread, rather cheap as well, under 3 for 7 and 3.50 at 10.  The smoothies here were really good too, used a little more mango powder than other places, but that isn't a bad thing. It was a tasty treat for everyone =)"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Banh mis that are well priced! They have lots of other small convenience store snacks.   They're in the basement so don't miss the entrance!"}
{"text":"Went with the 10 inch sandwich. The bread roll, at least in my opinion, is too big and ultimately their #7 grill pork bahn mi ended up tasting bready. The ingredients provided within was somewhat on the economic side. Add the word dry to this review as well. I prefer my bahn mi's moist, you know, with the awesomesauce inside of it. What gives?   Folks state this place is economic, I guess they haven't eaten bahn mi around china town. I personally don't find $7 bahn mi's economic when they can be found for $4 or less in locations 2 KM or so away.  Been going to Vua for years before they branched out and as per most franchises they leave nostalgia behind. I'm a huge fan of bahn mi so I had to try it out though.. Won't ignore the fact it's convenient where it is located and the sandwich was prepped in less than 5 but there are better options in the area, minus the inconvenience.  Lots of seating room inside, looks clean.  Staff is chaotic. Didn't bother to ask if I wanted anything else with my meal or a drink. They just randomly say numbers waving sandwiches instead of actual names of the human beings waiting for their food. Ok. Took me a minute to realize I ordered a #7 when someone wondered who's sandwich was on the tray. This same sandwich another people staffer just tossed on the table in a non-very careful way."}
{"text":"I'm seriously starting to love Vietnamese food. I've been craving a decent \"Bahn mi\" sandwich now for some now. I've bookmarked this place thanks to reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a shot yesterday.  I was NOT disappointed! I went with the BBQ Pulled Pork and the Grilled Chicken. Both were good but the Pulled Pork was out of this world! And for what... $3 each? SAY WHAT?!?  They have nice variety of sandwiches (at least 30!) as well as have bubble tea, iced coffee, and pre-made meals including sushi.   If you buy a pre-made meal you get a free spring roll!!!  SAY WHAT?!?  The service is OK but ordering from a lady who can't understand English or French and needed repeated instructions was a bit of a put-off. So I made sure the Bahn mi was done according to my taste. The woman in front of me was irate since she screwed up her order. So beware of that.  I'm definitely going to come back here.  How can I say no to a $3 delicious sandwich?"}
{"text":"Located right outside of the ever busy Berri-UQAM metro station and at the corner of the Latin Quarter, it's no wonder that this below ground restaurant always has a line up at the cashier. The incredibly affordable freshly pre-packaged options are plentiful: all different sizes of boxed sushi, salads (Greek, pasta, or Vietnamese), Vietnamese salad rolls, and sweets. If you've got time though, the made to order banh-mi and bubble tea are worth the wait.     Besides the few coveted seats on the sidewalk patio out front, the dim, but air conditioned dining area features clean seating and televisions looping the latest news and weather."}
{"text":"Cheaper version of Subway sandwiches with very bad service. They do not really pay attention to what you are ordering. Anyways, it is always jam packed as the prices are very student friendly. I won't mind going there again too for the price !!"}
{"text":"Why is this not a franchise? If this were a franchise, it would mean I could get these sandwiches everywhere. And if I could get these sandwiches everywhere, I would be soooooooo happy.   Despite the neverending line (it's essentially a continuous flow of people from open 'til close), there's rarely a sense of rush and the service is always exceptional. Pair this with some tremendously tasty banh mi sandwiches, and it's got all the makings of one of my favourite \"to-go\" spots. In fact, it's so good that even if I'm not hungry, I'll pick up a couple of sandwiches from here whenever I'm in the neighbourhood, just so that I can have them for later."}
{"text":"I honestly have no complaints about Vua aside from the fact that I spilt some of the delicious sauce on my pants as I was eating!   Vua is a cheap but good quality banh mi place in downtown Montreal. They have quite an extensive menu but only one vegetarian option, so that's what I opted for (as usual for me).   The base of the veggie banh mi was a tofu carrot mix which was prepared quite well and tasted very flavourful. After that came the toppings which were red onions, coriander, jalapeños and shredded carrot - all the toppings were super fresh!   If you decide to dine in, Vua has a really clean interior, but it works awesome as takeout! What really made this banh mi so good was the sauce - it was a fish sauce of sorts and when mixed with the mayo...mmmmm just so good! It wasn't overly salty - it was just perfect.   At the price point, you really can't go wrong with Vua."}
{"text":"At first glance Vua might look like the average food court kind of restaurant but as the saying goes don't judge a book by its cover.  This restaurant, which is not far from McGill Campus, serves up delicious banh mi at really affordable prices.  It can get really crowded at lunchtime but if you time it right you might just miss the masses that descend upon this place when the clock strikes noon.  When it comes to the banh mi there are two sizes to choose from: 7\" and 10\".  I usually go for the latter choice because I find it just the right size for me and I'm usually full after it.  As for the filling I usually get the BBQ pork because it is pretty tasty.  I usually get it spicy but I find there isn't much zing to the sandwich.  The other thing I like about Vua is that the prices are very reasonable for downtown.  You can easily get a delicious, filling lunch here without spending too much money.  I typically get a banh mi and spring roll when I come and only ever spend about $7-8.  That is a very good price for downtown and it makes this place a solid option when you're looking for lunch on a budget."}
{"text":"This place intrigued me since it is literally a stone's throw from my office and I was hearing good things about it.  For downtown the prices are very reasonable and the banh mi itself is quite tasty.  You can get a 10 inch banh mi for only $4.50 and it will do a good job of filling you up.  I went for the BBQ pork and it was very tender and juicy.  They also didn't skimp on the other toppings which I appreciated.   The reason I gave this place three stars instead of four is that they handled their lunch rush quite poorly when I came.  First of all the guy taking sandwich orders wasn't following any particular order as he floated through the line and consequently skipped a few people which in turn lead to confusion at the counter.  At the cash the sandwiches were piling up and they were confusing orders so people were waiting longer than necessary.  It actually felt like there were too many people on the floor and it was at the point where it was becoming counterproductive."}
{"text":"My first banh mi in Montreal! This was cheap ($3 CAD), filling, and perfect to take with me on the plane ride home. This tiny little Vietnamese sandwich shop serves readymade sandwiches, rice balls, and bento-type lunch boxes, in addition to the Subway-style assembly line where they will make a fresh banh mi sandwich of your choice. You can also get boba drinks and have a seat at one of their 3-4 small tables. Bathroom is upstairs in the Thai restaurant. I guess it's a shared space... Nice friendly staff, although some don't speak English, only Vietnamese and French!"}
{"text":"Que ce soit pour leurs délicieux bubbles tea/smooties, leurs ''Bánh mì'' , leurs petits snacks (viennoiseries, tapioca, ...), on adore Vua et aussi leurs prix très abordables. On y retourne lorsqu'on est dans le Quartier Latin !"}
{"text":"I consistently liked this banh mi joint since its opening a few years ago. Located in the heart of Latin Quarter, near UQAM, it's a perfect lunch spot for university students on a budget. The Vietnamese subs are decently priced at around $5 for a 7\", and they come with many options of fillings, both Asian and some more Western (ie BLT). I always order the Saigon one (Vietnamese sausage, pâté and cured meat) and I add the spicy peppers. Conveniently wrapped in a clean parchment paper bag, it keeps the bread crispy and warm--practical when hopping back to the campus! I don't understand why some ratings are low: if you're up for milder Vietnamese street food, this is the place to go since the seasoning is less strong than most other banh mi places. The soy sauce is dosed reasonably, there is no excess of fish sauce and the sour, pickled vegetables are kept to a minimum while the mayo is spread diligently. Vietnamese food has the terrible characteristic of being too salty, but this sandwich keeps it decent, since you can ask for a reduction of soy sauce in your sandwich."}
{"text":"Good prices. Taste fresh. They need more space to eat inside."}
{"text":"It's delicious!! I tried one for take out yesterday, and I can't help thinking of it until today. I definitely will go there again tomorrow! Love the mix of the tastes especially the carrot pickle is yum! I ordered a number 3 which is grill chicken sandwich. Guys you really should tryout this place!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect food solution for students and employees with short lunch break. All the food is fresh and the quality is superb. During lunch times the lines may seem long but the have a system that you actually won't have to wait more then 5min before paying and getting you food.  They have tons of meat selections but as a vegetarian I highly recommend #14 well balanced with spices, vegetables, tofu and sauce. And the best thing is they are extremely cheap less then 5$ for a big 10\" sub."}
{"text":"Un petit take-out tout près de la sortie Saint-Denis de Berri-Uqam ! C'est vietnamien, c'est rapide et c'est trop bon, vraiment ! Leurs petits sushis à l'unité me font tripper et je raffole du sandwich poulet Shish-taouk avec extra avocat :) C'est vraiment pas cher, les employés sont vraiment sympas et c'est rapide !"}
{"text":"La grande pancarte qui vante les sandwichs à moins de 3$ me tentais à chaque fois que je passais devant. Je m'y suis finalement arrêtée! Dès mon entrée j'ai été vraiment surprise de la variété des options et de la présence de sushis. Je ne m'y attendais pas du tout. J'ai pris un bahn mi de base au poulet grillé avec un jus de mangue qui fait rêver à des îles exotiques! Pour le prix et la qualité de la bouffe, je dois dire WOW. Pour ce qui est d'un \"fast-food\" bon, pas cher et différent, le concept  de Vua est rafraîchissant! J'y serai de retour bientôt pour tester le reste de leur menu c'est certain!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the one on saint denis, but this time i tried this place and they pretty much have the same great taste and vibe. Very affordable prices and I alwayssss get their nanaimo bars that are near the register! No one really notices them, but i think they are SO GOOD and creamy! Aside from the Nanaimo bars, their sandwiches are delicious and very affordable! Line ups can get long during rush hours but move quickly and is definitely worth the wait! Personally, I would recommend the grilled chicken sandwich which I always get but pretty much anything there is pretty good (aside from the bubble teas pls don't get them).    They also have little asian goodies like shrimp chimps, asian jellies and pocky sticks too! Best place for college student eats! :3"}
{"text":"Came here as I had couple hours to kill before my meeting with my customer.  Several of the places I wanted to go didn't take credit card, so I ended up here as last min.    Coming from TX, we have many Vietnamese communities, so naturally, pho and bahn mi are very common here.  I went in and got in line during lunch.  Ordered the first one, which I believe is their combination bahn mi, along with taro boba drink.    Bahn Mi was surprisingly greasy as i had a puddle of grease when done.  Both the bread on the outside, and inside was full of grease, or maybe it was butter and/or mayo?  Anyway,it was excessive for sure.  Overall flavor was OK, but it lacks that crunchiness of the veggies.  As to the taro boba, it really tasted like powder drink, which i know is how they make it.  But for whatever reason, or maybe it wasn't mixed well, it was very powder like, just wasn't what I had expected.  Only thing I like about it is that they took my credit card."}
{"text":"Considering that I've been eating Banh Mi from Garden Grove, California - Vua Sandwiches appeals to me for a number of reasons.   Service: The service here is pretty friendly. They gave us some good suggestions and could tell that we were from out of town. They speak both Vietnamese and French here. They gave us two complimentary Cafe Sua Da which were strong and tasty! Just like how a french pressed coffee should be.  Food: The sandwiches here are much more rich than the ones that I had in Orange County...mainly because they put a lot of mayonaise/butter sauce on the outside. They even offer to toast it for you. I had the Dac Biet (Special) and tried some of the Xa Xiu (BBQ pork) which were all really tasty. The pate is rich and is probably some of the best pate that I have had.   They also offer some take out sushi and che along with french baked goods. You can buy some food to go (there is limited seating) or enjoy your sandwiches out in the park. We took our sandwiches back to our hotel.   Bottom Line: Buy 5 sandwiches and get a free drink!"}
{"text":"Walked into this place just as they were about to close but managed to score a delicious grilled chicken Banh Mi sandwich for 4$ before they did! Variety of sandwiches and other options as well to choose from as well.  Really liked how fast they made our food and how friendly there were. Def worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Awesome place right next to McGill.   The decor looks great and the entire restaurant was very clean. There are a few outlets here and there, so it's possible to charge your phone.   The food was SO CHEAP!!! 5,75 (after tax and tip) for a 10 inch banh mi? Yes please! I can't wait to head back super soon.   The bread is so good! it actually tastes like good fresh bread and not old stale bread. I was so happy with it! They also give generous portions of meat and veggies.   If you go for the spicy option, it's not a sauce. They just add hot peppers. Still good, but it wasn't what I was expecting, so just a heads up.   They also have bubble tea, but I didn't try it. They have a fridge towards the back with tons of yummy snacks/dessets. It's worth checking out! it's fairly cheap.   I loved my experience. Hope to see you guys there soon!   PS MCSS members gets a discount if they show their card!"}
{"text":"Cute little vietnamese sandwich place on St Denis. I've been coming here once in awhile since the opening and have never been disappointed.   Along with different variety of sandwiches, they also have sushis, vietnamese street food and finger food. I really like the option of the brown baguette and the choice of 7 or 10 inches baguettes. Made to order, you can also customize your baguette for a little surcharge. The portions are really big and generous! I usually share a 10-inches sandwich with my hubby. There is usually a little line up but the service is fast and efficient. The prices are very reasonable and i believe they also hand out fidelity card for the sandwiches! Give it a try."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place while waiting for my mom. I wasn't hungry but since i love the Vua on St Denis so much, i decided to get two sandwiches to go. The place is pretty and clean but was empty. The lady behind the counter was very nice. I ordered the Dac Biet (classic meats) and the Nem Nuong. I asked for both all dressed and with added jalapeños. Ok... i was disappointed! The pickled carrots were dry and the coriander wilted. The baguette was stale and the mayo lacked the usual saltiness. And to top it all, NO jalapeños in sight. The portions of meats were also smaller then at the Vua on St Denis. Now i must tell you that this place opened only a week ago (December 22nd). Hopefully the quality will match the other place soon and this time was just a rookie's mistake!"}
{"text":"Entrée inapercevable .. il faut savoir que c'est dans le sous-sol. Fast food vietnamien, ca fait la job. Pas bcp de tables , surtout pour emporter."}
{"text":"Clean chic and big place for a cheap sandwich vientnamien , good enough , wifi available, fast and good fresh ingridients."}
{"text":"This was my go-to place when I needed a good, cheap Vietnamese sandwich. Although the workers usually only speak French/Vietnamese, all the sandwiches are labeled by numbers on the big screen, so it's not too difficult to communicate. About $3, and I always get the little sesame dessert balls for about $1.50. All sushi and to-go items are 30% (maybe 20%, not sure) after 9pm. They sell individual pieces of sushi (shrimp, salmon, egg, etc.) for 99 cents which I think is great if you need a small fix. Also, the milk tea + boba is kind of pricey here, but I'm also a California native where I can get it for $2. Here it's around $4ish dollars.  Come here for a good banh mi in Montreal. I miss you, BBQ pork sandwich aka #7."}
{"text":"I came in with a few friends and we were really excited to try their sandwiches based on all of the positive reviews. I've had many bahn mi in my day and I'd consider this experience one of my least favorite. Upon entering, you form a line and are surrounded by prepared snacks, meals and drinks. Everything looks great, but is a little pricey. I decided against a prepared meal as most of the reviews were for their sandwiches. I opted for the Saigon sandwich 10\" which cost $3.75. It's on special and all of the other 10\" sandwiches are $4.25. The Saigon has pate, Vietnamese sausage and ham with the radish/carrot slaw and cilantro. After purchasing our food we sat outside to enjoy our meals. There is no covering when you sit in their outdoor area so be cautious on sunny days as it can get a little hot. My first bite into the sandwich was all bread. This wouldn't have been so terrible if the bread wasn't hard and dry. Usually when I eat bahn mi the bread is crispy on the outside but soft on the inside, but this bread was hard and dry out the outside with an inside to match. Needless to say, I ate the sandwich open faced style as the bread tore up the roof of my mouth. Overall the downfall of this place is the following: 1) the bread to meat ratio is off. There's more than double the bread and it's terrible bread. 2) the atmosphere. It's like eating inside a convenience store. 3) The service. You never enjoy coming to a place where you feel like you're inconveniencing the staff."}
{"text":"Get the number  eight with extra onion and a spinach pie. :) The spring rolls and the meatballs were nothing special but still good. The customer service was excellent and smooth. We arrived to a huge line  which quickly worked its way up and out:) Enjoy"}
