{"text":"Delicious!  So good I forgot to take a picture. The chicken and waffles comes with a chicken quarter on top of the waffles with a sweet gastrique sauce. So good you will want more of it! Also huevos Ranchero and peroxide are great!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the low reviews for this place. I came here for lunch and it was amazing. The food is objectively super good and high quality, especially for the price. The bison burger was not small at all as other people have claimed, and the brussel sprouts were some of the best I've had. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The Urban Tap hoists a middle finger to PGH. $13 apps are an insult to customers. Who the fsck eats $13 of pretzel or cauliflower? cauliflower: $4/head. You might think you can graze a cow on this, but actually, it's more like ordering a mugging as a side dish.

Frying brussel sprouts is dumb - roast, my good man. The hot chicken is bland - srsly; bring your favorite hot sauce - you'll need it. Your ketchup is portioned into a small cup, just like Europe. Mmmm, bland dill-covered fries."}
{"text":"Brunch ends strictly at 2pm, so don't expect to get a menu at 130 & be served. Hostess will be rude about seating you as well. Go down the street to local."}
{"text":"Craft Beer Heaven. 100 beers on tap and really top notch selection. Came in from Las Vegas to visit family over the holidays and ended up making a couple trips here. The Burger was really good, Salmon was cooked perfectly. Brussels sprouts app was really good. Didn't try to wings but they looked very good. Front bar area is really really nice. Wish I could transplant this place back to Vegas, will be here anytime I'm back in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I've been to The Urban Tap a half-dozen times or so now, and it's a pretty solid four stars for me. It's nothing phenomenal worth raving to everyone I meet about, but definitely somewhere that I would recommend going among the numerous South Side choices. The atmosphere is great, with fast and friendly service.

They have a large number of nicely varied taps (a lot of places this time of year tend to have only beers whose names contain \"Pumpkin\" and/or \"Stout\", not so here), including a cider selection from Arsenal, which is always a nice refresher.

I do feel that the menu could use a little expanding, though I say this partly because the food that they do have is delicious. My last meal there was the BBQ Belly burger, which was a great blend of flavors and cooked to perfection, all set atop an almost-croissant-like flaky bun.

Definitely one of my favorite recent additions to the South Side, I'll be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"There is a great beer selection at the Urban Tap, but the food is overpriced and not that good."}
{"text":"Love the ambience! N love their mojito!! The food wasn't upto my liking. But cocktails n ambience make it worth it!"}
{"text":"A great new spot in South Side for a casual yet tasty meal.  Great drink selections of all kinds and great food. Staff are friendly and efficient.  I highly suggest the brussel sprouts and the truffle popcorn as appetizers.  The fish tacos are also delicious along with the brisket burger.   Brunch is a must - especially the bacon! Nothing I have had or seen has ever been not good.  Great draft selection that rotates seasonally and many other options for non-beer drinkers.  Great atmosphere although it can get a bit crowded and noisy on the weekends.  Highly recommended to you by a local South Side resident!"}
{"text":"This place was probably one the more trendy bars in my opinion on the strip. Very clean and lots of seating. Bartenders kinda seemed \" pretentious\" but once you start talking to them with more than just food and drink orders they were fun people. I would come back to try some the food. Lots of draft beers you can choose from."}
{"text":"Coke refill is NOT free! And they dont tell you until you read your check (2x Coke $5.00) and im only one person. But the alaskan cod burger is good."}
{"text":"We held a graduation dinner for 6 students and their families (35 total) at the Urban Tap and could not have been happier with the hospitality and food! The service and responsiveness of the Manager (John Yakopcic) and the staff helped to make this graduation party incredibly special for my son and his friends! He worked with us to select a set of menu items for our guests to choose, and printed cards for the event to make individual ordering easy. 

All the families commented on how perfect Urban Tap's space is for parties and how much they enjoyed the food. 

This is the third event I have held there, the prior ones being smaller business dinners with 10 and 17 guests.  The food has always been excellent, no matter what the party size.  And in addition, there are 100 craft brews on tap ...  'nuf said."}
{"text":"We attempted to eat here last night.  When we placed our order the server did not write anything down and had to return to the table because he \"blanked\" on my sisters order. 35 minutes and a bug in our water pitcher later we still did not receive our meals. Other tables that arrived after us were already served. We asked the server what was going on and he said they were short staffed and not prepared for how busy it was. My partner got up and went to the line to ask the manager how much longer it would be because we were heading to a concert. He said that a 9 top had really backed them up, then admitted that they lost our ticket but claimed  it was almost ready. There was no sign of our food in the window at all. We had to leave because we could not wait any longer. I understand things happen, however the situation was not handled well at all and it seems to me that our server simply flaked. 
Not going to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. Came for Sunday brunch with my friend while we were in town visiting and I would totally do the 6-hour drive again to have brunch here. I had the chicken on a biscuit and it was SOOOO good. Everything about it was delicious. My friend had the anglaise French toast, which I tried, and it was AMAZING. The fact that it's on a baguette I think adds to it too. There was a review I had read that said the mimosa carafe was heavy on the orange juice, but that definitely wasn't the case for us. I wish Pittsburgh wasn't so far away so I could have brunch there on a regular basis."}
{"text":"A gigantic sports bar masquerading as an intimate gastropub. And let's be clear - there is nothing wrong with a sports bar, and there are plenty of good (and bad ones) in Pittsburgh.

However, when you're presenting yourself as a gastropub and charging those prices for food & drink, you don't also get to have gigantic TVs covering every square inch of the place, and garish faux/steel girders and rivets everywhere. Choice of beer is good but unsurprising for Pittsburgh. A lot of the same breweries that everyone has (Souther Tier, Fat Heads, etc). Bartender was not very knowledgable about beer choices but I will say that all the staff was extremely nice and helpful - they keep the place from just getting one star. I had their mac & cheese as an appetizer and it was fine. Nothing amazing.

If I want to go out for a drink, I like to be able to converse with friends without distraction, and the abundance of TVs and loud, garish decor (and customers) everywhere in Pittsburgh is exhausting. Why aim (and charge) for a higher standard when at heart it's just the same old South Side nonsense? Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to brunch today here. First time ever. Terrible. The restaurant was semi busy. The bar had No one at it. We decided to sit at the bar because we like that the best. The bartender was terrible. She had half pink hair and really could have gave a shit it if we were there. I wanted to try some beers and that's was difficult. We weren't acknowledged while we sat there, drink less. And every time I asked her for samples she looked as though I was bothering her. There was another guy behind the bar, but both of them chose to converse with staff members rather than help us with beer selections or acknowledge our presence. Very disappointing. I work in the restaurant business and I get it, but this was terrible. We were the only people at the bar. Come on. The food wasn't much better. The eggs Benedict 2 ways lacked flavor and sauce. My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles which didn't have enough syrup and the bone-in chicken made it a pain in the ass to eat. I doubt we would go back for brunch. The bloody Mary's sucked and even though the bloody bar was good, the mix was bland and lackluster. The beer selection was good, but getting a drink was a process is rather not repeat. Chalk this up to a loss."}
{"text":"I get fish and chips almost exclusively whenever I go out. This place is by far the best I've had. They add a grilled bun to the mix, making a battered fish and slaw sandwich. HOLY FISH TETS. Just get it. And the peanut butter chocolate stout is as awesome as the upbeat waitstaff."}
{"text":"Great food, great bar service. Their happy hour half-price small plates are fantastic. I recommend the lamb sliders. The menu is thoughtful and well-prepared. They also have one of the best beer selections. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Sucks.  Staff Is a bunch of assholes and the food sucks. They do have an amazing beer selection but that is it."}
{"text":"Hard to run what could be a great bar when you have thugs talking to girls like trash calling them \"bitches\" and supposed managers and bouncers encouraging and reinforcing such crude behavior. Sad a group of 12 attorneys were treated so badly by such ignorance.  Good luck. Down the tubes you shall go."}
{"text":"Great selection of Draft beers. Worth the trip for the duck confit poutine. Atmosphere is also very enjoyable.  Staff could be a little better."}
{"text":"Awesome Food! Went there randomly for lunch.   I had a turkey burger which was cooked perfectly with a garlic aioli bibb lettuce tomato and I added some cheese. Bun was perfect on it.  I could order a side salad instead of fries with no extra charge.  It's was mixed greens and a great vinaigrette with tomato shredded carrots and radish.  My friend had a medium rare burger which was perfectly cooked with fries which were just the right amount of crispy and great herb seasoning.  I couldn't help but steal them off his plate!  Didn't even need to dip them in a sauce.  And the soup was perfect.  It was a cream based soup with I think ham potato mushrooms and seasoned perfectly.    Great quality food and whomever creates the menu obviously had a great eye for quality and puts a creative twist on every ingredient that goes into their food. Great atmosphere and creative lay out and they have a good eye for the details.   Service was good and our waitress was sweet.  Thanks for the great addition to south side!"}
{"text":"Bison burger ordered medium rare, came well done. Regular burger ordered medium, came at least medium well. Server notified, offered that \"bison cooks quicker\" with no other offer to fix it. Taste was still good but not what I asked for, sides and beer selection quite good. Atmosphere is good."}
{"text":"Such mixed feelings!!!!! 
     If I am simply reviewing the food that I've had thus far, I'm giving it a solid 4 stars, maybe even 4 and a half. They present a creative menu, definitely far and above normal bar food, and most importantly, they execute it well. Kudos all around for that.
     I'm okay with the space, though I think it does seem a bit confused. What is it? A gastropub? A great foodie destination? A frat boy sports bar? Who knows...
     This \"identity problem\" seems to carry over to service, unfortunately. I've experienced the perfect balance of friendly, knowledgeable and professional along with the dismal bar server who looked hungover, acted hungover AND chatted about her hangover with unengaged employees, hanging around the bar, lounging on a banquette, oblivious to the presence of customers. Coupled with a group of old-enough-to-know-better guys at the bar who acted like they just discovered the F-word (and couldn't say it often or loud enough...) definitely detracted from what would have been a perfect brunch.
     For this reviewer, it seems easy enough to back up this great food with great service, but thus far it just isn't happening. Management needs to be as involved with service as they are with culinary creativity & excellence. Casual doesn't equal lazy."}
{"text":"Had the grilled haddock fish tacos and they were fantastic. Probably best fish taco I've had outside of san diego. They also have a nice selection of hard ciders on tap for us gluten losers  bartender was very attentive and the open windows in the front is a nice feature. Definitely a great day drinking stop!"}
{"text":"Great bar! 36 drafts with a great beer selection. Had the BBQ belly burger and fries which were awesome!  Staff is totally on the ball too! They talk to my group of four and refer to our names throughout our visit! Great addition to the southside!!'n"}
{"text":"Went to the new location on Highland Ave. Beautiful space! Along with coat/purse hooks, there are outlets and USB ports at the bar! Great selection of beer, but they also make a good cocktail and have a nice wine selection. Food is very well prepared with a selection of appetizer, small, and large plates. Every staff member I encountered was very friendly and accommodating. Been there twice and had a very good experience each time. Will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"I've been here for dinner and brunch and I have to say the brunch is pretty amazing. Usually there is a huge wait at restaurants during brunch hours but Urban Tap is big enough where you will get seated super fast despite the crowd. Great location, easy seating, get service! Place is also great for vegetarians as well! I got the avocado and eggs and it was delicious! Highly recommend for brunch!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday night. The decor was pretty sweet, with a modern hipster-ish look. The place was pretty loud, but habitable. The waiter took a while to get us menus, but after that he was quick to get our orders. We tried the pork nachos. The portion was a bit larger than expected. Overall, it was really well made. The pork just melts in your mouth. I ordered the chicken sandwich. It came with avocados, tomato, and some aioli on the bread (which I think was ciabatta, but I could be wrong.). It came with a hefty serving of fries. Since I'm not legally allowed to drink, I can't give a great review of the bar. From what I've seen, however, the service is pretty good with some interesting cocktails. Overall, The Urban Tap is a fine place to stop for lunch or brunch, and I definitely hope to come back here."}
{"text":"A group of us decided to go here before the afternoon Pens game yesterday. It was a great pre-game spot! We were seated promptly, and the service was great. They serve brunch on the weekends before 2 pm, and they have a Bloody Mary bar, which was a fun surprise.  There's a variety of brunch items to choose from, and everyone in our group really enjoyed their food, especially the waffle slider and pierogie dish. I also was thrilled they had a few healthier options. I ordered the avocado and eggs and loved not having to feel guilty about what I ate! Also, great craft beer and cider selection and great music. Definitely give their brunch a try!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. I need to eat gluten free and even though they don't have a GF menu they were extremely accommodating. I had the salmon, my husband had the shrimp tacos and both were excellent. We had brussel sprouts for an appetizer. Normally they are deep fried, but they pan fried them for us and they were delicious. They beer and cocktail menu was extensive. I recommend the Manhattan."}
{"text":"My review is on brunch. The service was great, the food was just OK. Me and my friend ordered the Benedict Two-Way and both of our poached eggs were hard boiled (the runny yolk is the best part!). My other friend ordered the brunch burger (medium rare) and it was RARE. I mean like the meat wasn't even staying together. The waitress was very nice and agreed  that it was too rare and brought her a new plate along with taking her meal off the check. I've been here for happy hour before and enjoyed the food, but it just seems like the brunch cooking staff might not be as experienced."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the atmosphere in here. The service was great and we got our food right away and the wait was not long at all! I HIGHLY recommend the doughnuts as the server was right and there is never any left on the plate when someone orders them. They have a really delicious bloodily Mary bar for brunch and is a great date spot or somewhere to go with the gals."}
{"text":"I have been here 3-4 times and will continue to come back for food and drinks! The happy hour deals are excellent, the cocktail and beer list are quality, and the food is surprisingly great for what I thought was mostly a bar--it was a pleasant surprise. Good service, good specials, and good atmosphere. It can get a little crowded on weekend nights but there are other food and drink options right next door. I think it's worth it the wait! Favorite regular menu item is the fried brussel sprouts"}
{"text":"Recently visited The Urban Tap for dinner. We got a table immediately, even though they were extremely busy, which was awesome! For an appetizer we order the General Tsos Cauliflower, which was amazing. The portion was very sizable, and so, so delicious! It was very light, but packed a ton of flavor. For my entree I ordered the steak salad, which was ok. 
If you are looking for somewhere quiet and chill, this is not the place for you. It was very, very busy. The seating is very close quarters as well. It probably wouldn't be a place I would frequent as it was just too busy for me."}
{"text":"This was a weird brunch. Truly trying too hard with baked avocado (who does that?) and salsa with black eyed peas over red potatoes that were too big and not crispy as promised because of the odd salsa. Yikes! I wish these places would just do simple well instead of trying to be fancy when it's just not necessary. My husband's corn beef hash just looked...tired. He said it was ok, and his brother got the banana bread French toast. Just trying way too hard. And our waiter was very weird and not welcoming at all. We were just something to get done. I usually appreciate this place for being so close and open late with friendly staff and exceptional bar food. I won't be back for brunch."}
{"text":"The food tastes good. It had a nice environment and the staff was nice. But I ordered the sun dried tomato ravioli meal. It was hardly enough to make me full. The menu was confusing so I expected to get sides too. It was $17, which I think is insane for just some pasta. I may go here again, but I'm going to ask about portion size before I order."}
{"text":"This location is in Shadyside in Pittsburgh.  This is my go to spot after work.  The bone is great, the music is great, the crowd is great.  Never TOO crowded which is a plus!  The beer selection is always plentiful and the food has been great every time I've eaten here.  The Urban BLT for brunch might very well be THEE BEST BLT I've tasted in Pittsburgh!  It comes with a sunny side up egg... which I personally love... it's kinds cheating, but the sandwich is DELICIOUS! ;-)

I highly suggest this place.  The only downside is parking is limited... I've always found parking within a 3 block radius... but they sometimes have valet service which will help those who don't feel like looking for a space."}
{"text":"Decent brunch in that there was good service and ambiance, but I was not a fan of the food.

Salmon Benedict: bit too salty; couldn't finish. However, my friends were fans of the huevos rancheros and the banana bread French toast.  With the variety of beers on tap, I'm sure this would be an interesting place to get dinner."}
{"text":"Let me preface my 3 stars rating by stating the food is delicious for a different audience, but was a bit too rich for me.  I would go here for a happy hour type event for a fun atmosphere and for decadent bar food.  Their brussel sprouts are delicious,  fried with bacon bits, but I am more of a simplistic eater and really appreciate the taste of food without a lot of added sauce/cheese etc.  Otherwise this place has a really fun ambiance!  Of note to the wise: AVOID chipotle parking lot. Did not realize this was a tow away zone, but discovered this to my dismay after dinner."}
{"text":"The waiter service is great, the environment is great, and the bottomless memosas are awesome."}
{"text":"Yum! What a delightful brunch at a super cool bar. The atmosphere is welcoming and fun. Drinks are delicious and the beer menu is large. The French toast is the best we have had! Chicken and biscuit is HUGE definitely enough to share. The shrimp and grits is also a good menu option. The place is packed but we got a seat easily. Overall definitely an excellent hang out, we were all very impressed."}
{"text":"We got the fried Brussel sprouts and the BBQ pulled pork burger. Both had a unique taste to them. The pulled pork had a coffee BBQ sauce, it was good ( the fried pickles were the highlight of the sand which). The Brussels were great. It's a massive portion size so beware!"}
{"text":"We went for  brunch on a busy Sunday afternoon. We knew they did not take reservations but were told we could do call ahead seating.  Apparently they were too busy for this as a party of 20 called right before us.  To my surprise we were seated right away.  If you like Blood Mary's I recommend trying their Bloody Mary bar-lots of great add ins. They also have unlimited mimosas for $14.  I went with the waffle slider which was a sunny side up egg, sausage, gyre cheese and arugula in between 2 waffles.  I asked for a fried egg which they did not do, the sausage was McDonalds quality at best and the waffles were saggy. It was served with a side of potatoes which were delicious.  My other big complaint is that a friend ordered an omelet and wanted egg whites which they would not accommodate saying that they were too busy.  Our orders took a while to be served but they were so busy for a Sunday. I say skip the brunch and go for drinks. I would like to go back and try happy hour."}
{"text":"Recently went to the Urban Tap for brunch with some friends. I picked this place solely for the purpose of trying the mimosa flight. This did not disappoint. You get 4 different flavors which were strawberry, mango, pomegranate and regular OJ. They were all very good. We also ordered the donut holes as a starter. Perfect for sharing with a couple people. And they came with a delicious sweet dipping sauce. For my meal, I ordered the corned beef and pierogi hash. Probably the best brunch I've had in awhile. Everything was delicious, reasonably priced and the service was great."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently had a very enjoyable mid-week lunch at the Urban Tavern.  It has a neat atmosphere when all of its front windows are open to the street on a summer's day.  We each had a beer and a sandwich (which comes with a nice variety of sides to choose from).  Both the prices and the portions were very good.  Our server did a nice job when he was waiting on us, but seemed to disappear for extended periods of time.  This didn't bother us (as we were on vacation and taking our time), but if we were in a rush, it could have been frustrating."}
{"text":"So after my last review I was contacted by the wonderful manager (through yelp) and was offered a gluten free compromise.  That is to say, that though the chips of of the pulled pork nachos were usually fried (and thus not gluten friendly) that the Urban tap was more than happy to bake the chips.  Well a few weeks went by and I was talked into going back to the Urban tap.  I decided just to stick to the tacos which i knew were fine (it had been a long day and I didn't want to address the nacho situation).  Well what do you know... the manager found ME!    
Just after the tacos came out, I see a shadow approach the table out of the corner of my eye.  It was Chad, the manager, and he was holding a plate of pulled pork nachos with baked chips on the house.  He, and really The Urban Tap, have gone above and beyond in terms of customer service and continued attention to detail.  I was blown away that Chad would remember his suggestion/ offer, unprompted, on a rather busy evening!  One could say: speechless. 
The nachos themselves with the baked chips are a little less crisp than the fried chip variant.  That being said the chips still crunch and are delicious with all the same topping goodness. I highly recommend this alteration to any celiac out there.  I have definitely gone back since and may even stop in this evening!  Great place, atmosphere, food and a manager who really cares and is exceptionally friendly!"}
{"text":"Great bartenders. Fantastic burger cooked perfectly. Get the chicken dip it feeds an army. 
Owner on site. Great atmosphere will be a return customer
And they have phone charger plug ins under the bar"}
{"text":"If you love craft beer and good food this is the spot! I got the chicken Sandwich with the roasted Brussels sprouts. One of the owners was there testing out some of the new brews and shared some samples and some knowledge on the local beers. I'll come back every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Such a great place! I came for a reservation with a group of 10 on a Saturday and we were easily accommodated. Our waitress was great for handling a large group and she was very knowledgeable about the menu. Several of us ordered the Shaved Ribeye sandwich and it was SO GOOD, honestly one of my favorite meals I've had at a restaurant. Would recommend here to anyone for dinner before a night in Southside!"}
{"text":"I tried this place in the company of friends and colleagues on a Friday afternoon/evening for Happy Hour. I loved the industrial, simplistic decor and ambience. The set up allowed us to have several people in one enclave of a space. And let me tell you, this place is much larger than it looks. 

From 4:30-6:30p, only drafts were half off, which included ciders. And small plates were $2 off. The small plates ranged from about $10-15, which I think is rather expensive. Now, you can imagine what the large plates cost. I tried the Beer Cheese Risotto, and it was alright. I added salt for a little more flavor. I also tried the herbed fries which were much better and cheaper ($3). The Strawberry Shortcake was amazingly delicious! It was $10, but I very much enjoyed it. If I were to come here again, it'd be for the drinks and not so much the food. The menu contained items like whole smoked wings (these are not regular wings, ask before ordering!) and steak frites that just weren't my taste. 

We had a great time and an awesome waitress who really held our large party down. There were a couple oddities like the chair breaking out of nowhere (no one was hurt) and the holiday wreath randomly falling (because it was taped to the door?????), but what is life without a little randomness?"}
{"text":"Meat and cheese board is good and Brussels sprouts were to die for! Decent beer and cocktail list and our server was very nice. Atmosphere is very loud and young but nice and comfortable"}
{"text":"Today we celebrated my mother's baby shower at The Urban Tap's brunch. I couldn't say enough wonderful things about this restaurant. It started with two wonderful hostess' who knew my reservation and already had it planned out. Then the waitress we had (I wish I saved my receipt to know her name) she was sweet, accommodating and probably the best server I have had in a very long time! She cared about our experience and the event we were celebrating. The food and drinks were wonderful, not only were the plates presented perfectly, they were delicious. The prices were affordable especially for the larger party we had. All around such a unexpected wonderful experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by last night not sure how they are going to stay open food not good the open windows let in so much exhaust fumes building located in a area where I was asked for money couple of times. At the bison burger which had no taste"}
{"text":"This is such a fun spot for happy hour specials and a quick bite! Very diverse menu with unique options. I can totally see myself going back until I try every item! They also have 100 beers on tap so it's awesome for a game or meeting with friends. They have this huge screen they pull down for games!! The staff is super friendly and is really good about paying attention to refills and concerns."}
{"text":"Everything here desperately lacks seasoning. Bland bland bland. Service is also terrible. Both times I've come in I've had to wait 10-15 minutes before even being acknowledged once sat. Even then, the severs really have no sense of urgency or care to help you it seems. They have a good beer selection but that's about it."}
{"text":"Near my hotel near 10th and Carson, I ducked in to avoid the sudden cold.  I really enjoyed my wantons and mussels.  I chose the curry flavor which had a nice medium spice level and good flavor.  Good beer selection of local and craft beers.  The best aspect of my experience was my waitress.  She gave me a great beer recommendation, Great Lakes Conway Irish ale, was very attentive and brought my food out as soon as it came up (I could see the kitchen from my seat).  If you can get her you are in luck.  Not all wait staff seemed to have the same level of attentiveness as they hung out at the hostess table for large parts of the night."}
{"text":"So the staff is friendly, the decor and design is good, and the menu looks good but that's about it. Food was ok but came out cold after waiting for 45 minutes when they weren't busy. No one working here knows what they are doing. Everything takes forever and isn't done right. It just lacks most of what you want in a place to hang out, eat or drink. Maybe it's because it's a new place but it's no excuse, not coming backup find out."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot , I thought this was a cool place on the inside . The staff was defiantly on top of their game , I tipped extra just for that reason, well on to the food part I got the fish and chips which I might add that I live in Kansas City so I don't know \"how real fish and chips should be\"so on that note I thought they were good a little too much breading on it but still it was good. The beers were awesome on tap got a couple of of seasonal brews that were really good I would go back for sure but I live in KC so the chances of me coming back are probably slim to none."}
{"text":"When you walk in, you can't help but see the impressive list of their beers on tap.
I came with a party of 11 and we got seated in their back room behind the cool 'beer wall'. (Being seated in the back seems to happen if your party size is over 10).

I ordered the smoked turkey sandwich. Oh my soOo good. Our food took awhile, but we also had 11 people.. so yeah. The apricot preserve gave the brie sandwich just enough sweetness in combination with the turkey and bacon. Dang I was surprised, because I wouldn't usually get turkey but I was deciding between the banh mi and that, man I don't regret it.  

We were here for a friend's birthday, and it seemed they didn't have any birthday dessert or anything but that is likely due to us having provided a cake.. (Note: there is no cake fee here!) We intended on it being a surprise and our server had brought out the plates at least 5 minutes before he brought out the cake which left our birthday girl in confusion.  Successfully we played it off, and he eventually came out with our cake. We kind of felt that although we were in the back room, that maybe they forgot about us..?!

Judging by the other Yelpers who have came here, I would love to return for their brunch and/or happy hours. (They serve \"duck and waffle\" here?!) And did someone say bloody Mary and mimosa bar...

Food: 5/5
Service: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick bite before heading out for the night with a group of five. We split a bunch of stuff but all items we ordered are delicious.  We ordered buffalo wings, chicken sandwich, chicken tacos, chopped salad. The beer list was great and they also make delicious cocktails--loved the selection. Visited here during a beautiful day so the doors were open, the atmosphere was awesome. Our waitress was really friendly and provided great service."}
{"text":"Great food, great ambience. Service was good as well. Cheyenne, our server did a great job.

Would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Craft beer on tap! Food was surprisingly good.  The fries were amazing and the steak sandwich was really good.  My friend had the brisket which he enjoyed with a salad.  5 on 5 for food and drinks considering it is situated on the Southside strip were drunken college crowd dominates.  A young crowd but good place to stop in when it seems like all the other area restaurants are full or way to expensive.  Service was great as we had Amber working our table.  It is somewhat loud but you just need to yell your conversations."}
{"text":"Right next door to my new favorite salon is The Urban Tap, a cute little place with shiny new TVs and a chalkboard menu of microbrews. I was impressed with the menu, which offered more vegetarian options than I'm used to. I ordered a fried tofu sandwich, which was good. I don't normally pay attention to timing, but it was pretty  slow (10-15 minutes.) My date noted that a sandwich was sitting on the kitchen counter for at least five minutes before someone grabbed it. A sizeable group of young boys were near our table--they seemed out of place in a sports bar, but I guess it's good to know that the place is kid-friendly. Overall, still some kinks to work out, but a decent little place for a quick bite and beer."}
{"text":"Urban Tap is a great choice for any beer lover! With 100 beers on tap in all varieties, you can't go wrong. Although their menu is pricey, catch them at happy hours for awesome deals. The atmosphere is unique and fun, and the service in my experience has always been friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of friends on my Birthday. Overall it was a great experience. The food was good and there were big portions. I had the tofu sandwich, which came with about 2 pounds of fries. The beer/drink prices were reasonable (3-5 dollars), and the waiter automatically split checks for us,which was nice. 

The only problem I had was the wait. There were several open tables and we still waited for over an hour. Also, some of them had \"reserved\" on them, but when I had called to make reservations, they said that they do not take reservations on Saturdays..."}
{"text":"Yum!  I lived 3 blocks away for a couple of months and ate at the Urban Tap at least 3x/week. I love this place, the food and staff. I brought tons of friends for drinks and they all loved it, too. The crew went above and beyond to accommodate my family and my two little boys with chicken fingers and chocolate milk when we visited on a Saturday evening. (Zack rocks!)

The beer selection accommodates every mood and taste. I was a fan of a jalapeno mule they customized for me. Best service ever! Thee industrial décor and perfect tunes make this a great place for lunch, a little work and dinner. They have outlets for your phone under the bar.

The menu - I tried many choices... house salad with salmon, curried tofu, popcorn with truffled bacon, pork nachos, burger, brussel sprouts, broccoli and cheddar soup, cream of mushroom soup...all very good. Sunday Brunch is insanely amazing! The avocado eggs were delicious and the bloody mary bar on steroids with grilled cheese and mac and chees bites, charcuterie in addition to the usual pickled accompaniments. Just. So. Good!

My favorites are the popcorn and the salad with salmon. The pork nachos are amazing but make sure the pork is hot - it was cold one time I got it and ruined the dish.

The caprese sandwich with  bacon they are trying for the fall menu is my favorite - It comes as a wrap now - they added turkey and pesto to it but I still like the first iteration with balsamic, tomatoes and mozzarella on a toasted fluffy ciabatta - simple and perfect. I am still hoping they add the Chackwich to the menu - the two super cute bartenders ( Chad and Zack) - with me in the middle. Kidding aside - the service is phenomenal.

John and his crew have done a great job. I hope to see more Urban Taps in other parts of the city.  I will note there is a great gym - Met Performance  -behind The Tap - you'll need it if you  loved the UT as much as I did."}
{"text":"If you're looking for variety and something different for a happy hour, this is the place to go. They have a wide selection of beers, ciders, and sours on tap from you to choose from. Draft drinks are half off during happy hour, so you feel more free to try something new rather than your go-to drink. They also have a good variety of food options. We ordered the giant soft pretzel with beer cheese, loaded nachos, wings, and general tso cauliflower. The cauliflower and pretzel were my favorite out of the appetizers we ordered and provided enough food for our group to all try. The wings were sort of plain, just breaded chicken with no sauce and the skin fell off the meat as soon as you bit in. Overall, the restaurant has a good rustic atmosphere and a more mature crowd than other bars in South Side and a great selection."}
{"text":"I really want to give Urban Tap 3.5 stars. Randomly ended up here for dinner because Mad Mex was closed. Large beer selection which is great and since we went during happy hour my beer was only $2.75. The food is a bit pricey. I got the pulled pork sandwich which was 12$ and the hubby and I split the curried cauliflower which was $16. Both were good but not the best i've ever tasted. The fried pickle on my pulled pork was pretty amazing though. 
Staff were super friendly."}
{"text":"I got drinks, drinks were good. I got food, food was good. Nicholas  pretty great. Vegas and Britney are awesome!!!! I'm going to miss them!!!! Steve is great to!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for any occasion, but especially to watch a sports game.  TVs are set up all around, so you have a great view from any table.  I haven't usually had a problem getting a table, but you can call ahead for a reservation.  The food is really good and even pretty healthy, especially for a sports bar.  I have had the black bean burger, which is amazing if you are vegetarian or vegan.  Last night we got the pork nachos to snack on, which were messy but tasty.  I also love their fries.  If you're looking for a lighter snack, they have a couple different styles of popcorn to choose from; I have had both the sage & maple and the truffle bacon & parm, and would recommend either.  When I think about Urban Tap though, I really think about the tap--they have an excellent selection to choose from, regardless of what style of beer you prefer, and rotate their selection pretty frequently, great if you're looking to try something new!"}
{"text":"I went to this bar for the first time to watch football on Saturday. It is pretty awesome.  An open space with a lot of large tv's. I didnt order food but our waiter was super friendly. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Had such a great experience here. Drove up from Morgantown for a show at Club Cafe and this place was just a half block up Carson so we decided to grab a bite to eat. Although the restaurant was packed, we were seated immediately and did not have to wait for our server to greet us. Their craft beer selection is great and our server did an excellent job of making some delicious suggestions. We tried their bison burger and their special of the night, a Korean BBQ burger, and both were excellent. Wait time was significantly short although they had a packed house that night which is very impressive. It was also nice to see the managers out on the floor helping the servers keep things running smoothly. For our first time there, we have no complaints and plan on coming back! A definite recommendation to anyone visiting the area!"}
{"text":"The menu rotates, so it's hard to say what entree to try. Just trust that it will be delicious. 

I had the bison burger this trip with the dip trio and was pleased with the portion size and final product. The Brussels sprouts (yes, Brussels sprouts) are excellent! I could make a meal of these alone. 

As far as drinks, I'd recommend the Pimms Cup. It's delicious and festive looking but weak, so you could drink these all night socially and still drive yourself home without concern.

One last thing: there's a paid lot literally right next to this location, so you don't have to fight the normal Carson Street parking scene. The DO monitor this lot and ticket in teams, so pay for as long at you think you'll be. It's worth it to avoid the ticket."}
{"text":"Cocktails and appetizers on a weeknight, yum! Pork Nachos and some strawberry drink. I enjoyed it, but service wasn't great. I would definitely try again, and am interested in the brunch."}
{"text":"Urban Tap definitely exceeded my expectations. I came here with a group of people for St. Patty's, and for as insane as it was outside, Urban Tap was really cool on the inside. The staff was extremely friendly, and the crowd that this place pulls in seems to be in their mid to late 20s. It's not your typical dive bar on the Southside. 

The setup of the place was neat and it was really clean, pretty edgy. There's several TVs, and it's a spacious place. Someone in our group pointed out that their draft list on the wall included Beer Advocate ratings, and I thought that was pretty cool. They also have a lot to choose from. I didn't get to chance to try any food, but the people in my group who did seem to like it. The prices are pretty comparable compared to the nicer places on the Southside. 

I will definitely return and I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I met my girlfriends here for brunch on a Sunday. The food was amazing! 3 of us got The Benedict which had a generous portion of salmon and another person ordered shrimp and grits which she loved. Service was attentive and friendly, shout out to Bear! Will definitely be returning here for dinner so I can try some of the 150 beers they have on tap!"}
{"text":"100 beers on tap is always a good thing, tho they waste (or not, depending on your POV) a few taps on things like Miller lite and bud light. Lots of food choices, most of which look fresh and taste great. 

Avoid the bison burger though - For $16, it's the most expensive sandwich on the menu, but the meat patty is the size of a hockey puck, or maybe slightly smaller. When the group of seven I was with received our food, the bison burger was, by far, the saddest (yet most expensive) meal on the table. 

I won't let one bad option on one occasion ruin the review, but I really hope the establishment does something to improve that dish. I would certainly go back, but I won't ever be ordering that again."}
{"text":"Amazing Burger!!! 

I only post for places that are good and no bad posts. This place has amazing burgers and so glad I chose the brisket burger with arugula. I upgraded to 2 differ met cheeses, cheddar and smoked Gouda.

The fries were great but it's all about the burger. Sat at bar, all staff friendly and attentive. Great selection of beers too.

Legit craft beer selection for hop heads that like it above 9%abv

I would recommend a visit if your on south side in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Beer beer beer, also really good food. Can be a little too hipster at times, but still a cool place."}
{"text":"So I walked in here on a lovely Wednesday afternoon. One because I love the open windows two because of the draft list of course.  However, when I walked through the doors I wasn't greeted by a smile or a hello it was actually by the entire staff sitting in a booth staring at me. I literally felt so unwelcome that when I sat at the bar I felt like I was pissing everyone off. UNREAL! The only thing that turned my experience around was my bartender he was super helpful pretty much told me what to order but he did not steer me wrong. Parm bacon Brussels and pulled pork nachos along with a golden monkey did it for me! Solely because of him will I come back. I just wish he gave me his name!! Thanks guy!"}
{"text":"Urban Tap is located in Shadyside which is a neighborhood that's on the east end of Pittsburgh. It's known for their upscale shops and boutiques. It is also becoming more popular with millennials moving to the area. 

I was in town visiting my sister and brother in law for the weekend and Urban Tap is one of their favorite places to eat so we stopped in Friday afternoon for lunch. It was fairly empty so we're able to get seated right away. It's very spacious with plenty of seating available. One of my favorite details about this place were their stools they have at the bar and also at the long \"picnic\" like tables. They are attached by a metal bar that you're able to swing in and out which makes for easy maneuvering. 

They have quite a wide selection of beers on tap that is all listed on the wall behind the bar. You can't miss it as it takes up pretty much the whole wall. The items on their food menu are pretty unique. They have certain items that you won't find at another place.. i.e. Collard Green Eggrolls and Duck and Waffles. I got the Lemongrass Pork Bahn Mi with a side of the herb fries. This is definitely unlike the Bahn Mi that you'd usually get at a regular Vietnamese restaurant but that's to be expected. The pork was nice and tender, and paired with the veggies, it was very flavorful. The only downfall was the bread was a bit too hard for my liking. No big deal though and definitely wouldn't mind coming back the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I went for brunch today. The food was great and drinks were amazing. The service was quick and our waitress was really nice. Prices are good for the amount of food served but lacks variety. Atmosphere is fun and chill. I definitely recommend going."}
{"text":"I had an awesome experience here. I joined them for a Saturday brunch and was very pleased. My only suggestion is that they should offer a true bottomless brunch. 

The food was well prepared and visually appealing.  The service is polite, pleasant, and professional. The ambiance is upbeat and welcoming. They had a wide range of beers on tap. Overall, thumbs up for their weekend brunch."}
{"text":"This place has really great food. Their wings are smoked and then fried -- amazing! Also, the hot spinach salad is my favorite salad hands down. The atmosphere can be hit or miss. It is like a grown up Local, with much better food and cool, fancy drinks. However, sometimes it is busy and fun, sometimes the music is SO LOUD you have to scream at the other person you are having dinner with to be heard. There is no need to blast music, this isn't a club! Also, I do think the table lay out could be better. I love sitting by the big windows and they only have three round high tops that seat four people and then one long table that seats eight. There is room to add more tables -- AND THEY SHOULD! The windows are the best seat in the house and it would be nice to have more places to sit near them."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great atmosphere, and a large variety of drinks. One of my favorites!"}
{"text":"Had such a good time at the Urban Tap today. Meant to get there for Brunch but, ehh, I was late. Had their lunch menu instead. Our server was Josh, and he was great! Funny, prompt, and always polite. All of my friends were flirting with him! He's on Tinder ladies. Check out the picture in my review. ;) 

Our table got 4 carafes of mimosas. Even though there were only 5 of us, we couldn't help but be lushes in the early afternoon! I ordered the fried brussel sprouts for an appetizer and I also had a Cobb salad. Both great choices. I hate brussel sprouts that taste too earthy as if they were just picked from the ground, remained uncooked and then put on your plate. These were not those kind of sprouts. They were soo delectable--fried with both onion and bacon and seasoned to perfection. I could have eaten another plate of these, by the way. I sooo need this recipe. The Cobb salad as I said was great too. A great sized portion. The salad was really fresh. 

I love everything about this place. The ambiance, the people, and the drinks. Of course, my friends and I stayed well over two hours, and we didn't feel rushed to leave at all. We are some chatty Kathys and I certainly felt that we could be there forever."}
{"text":"Everything is right about this place except the food. Had The bacon wrapped meatloaf which was suggested by the waitress. Really really really not that great and definitely not worth the money. You did not get very much for your money, and what you did get, Was kind of just tasteless. The roasted vegetables were dry and way overcooked. Was there with a group of friends, and everybody pretty much said the same thing about all the meals. Lots of good beer here, but the food was really subpar to say the least."}
{"text":"Giving Urban Tap a 2 star rating (for now). I know this location is relatively new so maybe it just needs some work.I have gone to the Urban Tap on Carson St multiple times for drinks and maybe ate there once or twice. 

The atmosphere inside the Highland Ave location is awesome! It's huge and very industrial. The bar when you walk in the center of everything with giant beer on tap list. Perfect for beer lovers! The wood tables and unique seating I definitely loved! 

 We went here Saturday night for a friends birthday dinner so we made reservations for 7 and it took us a few extra minutes to get seated, which was fine because we had some drinks at the bar. When we were seated, I ordered a flight of beer which took about 25 minutes to receive (I'm pretty sure the waitress forgot) and others in my group took awhile to receive their drinks as well. For my entree I ordered the hot chicken sandwich which was about 30% chicken and 70% breading. I probably wouldn't order it again and I am not a huge fried chicken person to begin with... just trying something different. Everyone else at my table agreed their meals were just OK.  I will return to this Urban Tap location but probably for drinks only."}
{"text":"This is my favorite brunch spot in Pittsburgh. It's a great atmosphere with good jams, the front wall / windows are wide open, a huge draft beer selection, and a very friendly wait staff. The food is amazing.  For some reason every time we have went, it wasn't overly crowded so we are always able to get seated right away. Great Pgh spot."}
{"text":"We came to urban tap two nights after their opening. The environment was exactly what you would hope for dinner and drinks with friends. We were welcomed with friendly faces and the food followed suit. Definitely order the salmon poke and shrimp tacos. They could definitely experiment a little bit with their mixology but over all a great experience.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I know I didn't give The Urban Tap on Highland Ave. a very good review, but I have to give a shout out to the South Side location! 

My girlfriend was in town and we were looking for a place to grab lunch and some beers. We decided on Urban Tap and got there around 2:00 on a Saturday afternoon. It was packed (there was a Pitt game on) and the only place to sit was at the bar, which worked out better for us anyways. The bartender was super nice and allowed us to have samples of the beers before ordering any. We both got 3 beers and loved trying the different kinds!

We also both got the grilled chicken sandwich and it was seriously amazing! I keep thinking about it! It was served with avocado, red peppers, and siracha aioli. The bread was toasted to perfection! I hope that the Highland location will catch up to South Side's soon."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour with a coworker as they advertised half off all draft and cocktails and $2 off small plates. Atmosphere was country style, clean, inviting. We sat next to the open window on a nice hot day (we are from Florida, so we love the heat)! Staff was super friendly, helpful, knowledgeable. 

Good selection of beer, but nothing special. Happy hour beers were between 3-5$. 

Food wasn't anything out of this world. The small plates surprisingly cost more than the large plates and sandwiches, with the happy hour deal they came out to be about the same price. 

I'd come again for drinks on happy hour but not for the food. I'll actually try other places instead."}
{"text":"Bar and bartenders 5/5. Food 4/5. Beer selection and cocktails 5/5. Honestly this place is great if you sit at the bar. Bartenders are friendly and good at what they do. BUT, everytime I sit at a table it's a painful experience. Waitstaff could care less about the tables and all hang out in a big group at the end of the bar. It's beyond inconvenient, it's just infuriating. I will go back here and enjoy my food, drinks, and the great atmosphere of the bar but if no bar seats are available I will not be seated at a table ever again. 3 stars because not everyone wants to sit at a bar."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I am not a 20 something barfly who frequents the Southside to pound shots and beer until I can stand up. I'm a normal 50 something working person who enjoys well prepared food and excellent service.  I work on the Soithside and have been to this place many times for lunch. There is nothing wrong with the food at Urban Tap.  It's not the best food I've had, it's certainly not the worst.  The duck poutine is actually quite delicious, although I wouldn't eat it every day.  The burgers are fine and the salads are fine.  

My problem with the Urban Tap is what seems to be a complete lack of regard for customer service.  The lunch service is adequate, unless it's busy.  But something happened tonight that really turned me off.  I met my husband there for a pre-concert bite to eat and he arrived before I did.  He was seated at a table right in front of the open kitchen and when I got there, he told me about a 20 minute conversation he'd heard booming out of the kitchen about blowjobs.  Seriously.  The cooks and the waitstaff were taking at the top of their voices about the finer points of administering oral sex to men.  At full volume.  Shortly after I got there, I saw a large, filthy, sweaty guy in a brown chef jacket saunter behind the bar and start pouring himself soda after soda.  We were there for about an hour and he was behind the bar for the last 15 minutes of our visit.   I can only assume it was the cook.  And other staff were wandering in and out from behind the bar taking to him.  His assistant also came out and hung out behind the bar.  

This is just bad form.  I saw nobody that resembled a manager doing anything to supervise.  As close and convenient as this place is to my office, I can't imagine going back.  Yikes!"}
{"text":"Superb draft selection, being a craft beer fan, I was pleasantly surprised to get that option. The menu was very interesting as well, perhaps I was expecting very basic bar food, but it was a treat! Curry cauliflower, ginger chicken sandwich didn't fail to surprise"}
{"text":"I got two margaritas here and the first one wasn't good. I told server guy that complement and he bring me another one. They put extra shot for the second one but i wasn't ask for that and they charged me double for my second margarita. They wanted me to pay 20$ for one margarita. This insane"}
{"text":"The food and service are ok.  When you walk in, you're greeted by two attractive, disinterested hostesses. The general feel is that no one cares you are a customer and the food is just ok."}
{"text":"The food was savory and delicious. I got the duck and waffles with a side of pepper hash and it hit the spot. They had great atmosphere and were playing some cool music. The mimosas were excellent, didn't get to try any of the beer yet but will have to next time we go!"}
{"text":"I legit enjoy Urban Tap.  I've been here twice before and enjoyed my meal both times.  The first time I ordered the Butternut Squash Gnocchi and practically licked the plate clean.  The second time, I wanted to try something new so I went for the Pulled Pork sandwich.  I still think the Gnocchi was better, and would order it again the next time I go.

The atmosphere is definitely trendy. The bar seems massive to me and each time I've gone (one weekend night and one mid-week) there were a crowd of people around it.  I don't drink so I can't speak to what's on the menu, just that they give you a newspaper-looking list of options.

I definitely could see some kinks the restaurant is sorting out, but I never had rude service or even an exhausted server (justifiably so).  

They are on the No Wait app, which I liked because this place can become easily and quickly crowded.

If you're passing by Urban Tap, it's worth a stop."}
{"text":"The best local bar,I have been there so many times we just love katy berry,staff so friendly and always good service and atmosphere.Thank you"}
{"text":"The food will never disappoint!! One of my favorites!!! Great beers on tap always and excellent service! Kyle is the best!!! Oh ps; best buff chicken dip in Pittsburgh mmmm!!!"}
{"text":"First things first.  Make reservations.  That is my advice.  We went to the Urban Tap on a Saturday Night at 5 and all of the tables were full or reserved.  

The beer selection is pretty eclectic.  Seems a little IPA heavy but that is right up my alley.  Service is prompt and casual.  The menu is interesting and diverse.  We all stuck with small plates or sandwiches which were tasty.  I had the fish tacos from the small plate menu.  Three tacos was more than enough.  They were a little spicy, so if you aren't in on the spice, then ask for your jalapeno's on the side.  

It is A-OK.  I wasn't wowed or disappointed.  It was just A-OK."}
{"text":"Amazing food, beer, and atmosphere here. Got th bison burger and my gf got the house burger with port belly on it. Both dinners were made perfectly. Micro brews were on point too. Look forward to next trip to Pittsburgh to go to this bar."}
{"text":"Not a fan of the food here at all. I am not typically so blunt but I have gone three times without reviewing and now I have to say something because I keep accidentally coming back because people speak so highly of this place that I actually forget that thing I don't like is the food. The service is pretty good, the people are definitely friendly, the parking situation is better than most places in the southside, the vibe is cool, the drink selection is strong but the food just doesn't taste good.... at least not for brunch. I have tried the French toast, the chicken and waffles, the shrimp and grits, and the House donut holes. None would put this among the better breakfast or brunches in Pittsburgh. I love a hot and fresh donut hole as much as the next person so if you'd like that an a hot coffee the portion and price are solid, but honestly just dine elsewhere, again at least for brunch....this is not a gem of the Pittsburgh early afternoon scene."}
{"text":"This place is huge--I didn't even realize until after finishing my meal that there's an extra dining room behind the restrooms! Their claim to fame is that they have 100 beers on tap--and amazingly, they also have wine on tap--weird. I have to admit, I wondered a bit as I ordered my beer just how many weeks it had been since the last time someone ordered this variety--perhaps one of the problems of having so many on tap--some are bound to go mostly un-drunk. That said, the beer tasted mostly okay, although it did smell pretty weird. Hmm.

Honestly, the menu is what drew me in for lunch in the first place--lots of the dishes looked creative and interesting (curried cauliflower, shrimp banh mi tacos, etc.). Imagine my disappointment when I realized that the food was actually...bland. The pulled pork nachos were perfectly fine, except they had almost no flavor or spice. They really needed some good salsa and guacamole on top--and no, the Tabasco sauce they handed me when I asked didn't help much. The pork egg rolls were edible, but nothing I'd order again. Same for the General Tso's cauliflower--basically just fried bar food. 

Anyway, to sum it up, this place is _fine_ and the food is okay, but it's certainly not worth what they're charging for it, and I wouldn't _choose_ to eat it. It'll fill you up in a hurry if you're hungry, but I can't imagine actually wanting to seek it out. 

PS: their \"small\" plates are actually enough to feed at least two people!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. The decor was very urban and modern. My omlet was pretty bland in taste for brunch. I tried my husband's pierogis which were amazing though. The waitress was very nice, however I would say service was satisfactory. May try this place for dinner next time."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great. Even when it's busy, you can always seem to get in. Beer selection is great, nitro cold brew on tap, and the brunch is incredible. Definitely a hidden gem if you're looking for an alternative to the crowded brunch places around."}
{"text":"We went to the Urban Tap this past Sunday for Brunch.  I LOVE brunch... The only early meal that's not only acceptable to booze, but encouraged!  After searching a few other Brunch stops we agreed we were intrigued by their menu.  What initially was going to be a group brunch turned into an intimate meal with my husband and friend Chelsea S in the good ole Saaahside.  

Parking here was so convenient, something not to be taken for granted in the South Side.  There is a lot basically right next to the restaurant that is free on Sundays.  We arrived shortly after noon, the atmosphere was very nice, modern, and I absolutely loved the open windows at the front of the place giving it a lovely airy feeling on a beautiful pre-autumn day.  I already cheated, as I usually do, and studied the menu online prior to brunch so I was pretty set on what I was going to order, as was the hubs.  Please note, the menu provided online is not exactly correct and does need updated.  For instance, they no longer offer bottomless mimosas.  You can order a carafe for $10.00 which gives you about 5-6 glasses.  I also noticed their online menu mentions pork belly in a few dishes but their actual menu has no such reference.  All was ok, as we order a carafe of mimosas which turned into 3 carafes before we concluded.  I chose the Breakfast Pierogie Sauté, as the H got the Eggs Benedict two ways.  Both dishes online said \"pork belly\" but in house it was I believe sausage in mine and a cured ham in his.  

The wait staff was pleasant, efficient, and never let us wait long for service.  Our food came out in a reasonable time, actually almost perfect for brunch meaning not too quick, but not too long, so we had time to chat and drink and enjoy the leisure of Sunday Brunch like one should.  When our meals were served they did not disappoint.  My sauté as I can detail contained a type of hash mixed sauté veg and sausage, with a nice balance of sweet and heat, topped with two plump pillow pierogies, laying underneath two sunny side up eggs finally topped with some mustard.  The richness of the egg yolk when cut through rolled throughout the dish coating all elements that lay beneath.  It was quite delectable, perfect portion, at a very reasonable price.  I tried the eggs benedict and it was also really good, but I would have liked more hollandaise as it was mostly drizzled on the eggs.  The cornbread base was unique.  Never had a benny prepared like that.  Again very distinctive and original.   

We stayed for a couple hours enjoying our food and drinks, actually long enough that many people were filtering in for the lunch fare.  We noticed many other dishes coming out that looked amazing and smelled even better.  I think I will have to come back here to try their other menus soon..."}
{"text":"I really want to give the best possible recommendation for having an event at Urban Tap.  I am a person who would, and did, have a baby shower at a bar/pub.  Only regret is not being able to drink all the beers. (Writing this as the pregnant one, not the hostesses.)  Granted most of this was organized without my involvement, but I can say that the weekend-of was really excellent.  

The back room is a really nice space and perfect for a private event.  We had 35 people and fit really nicely.  I love the decor back there-- lots of greens, natural light-- very classy.  John was our event coordinator, and my mom had only nice things to say about working with him.  I myself can attest that he seemed to be a perfectionist and did everything he could to make sure things went off perfectly.  The day before, we swung by at lunch time and found that the small menus that had been printed for the event had a typo, and he immediately had them reprinted.

The food and drink were excellent.  We had 4 items from the brunch menu to choose for a sit-down brunch, and before that there were donuts (amazing- must have), fruit, and a bloody mary bar, which was no ordinary bloody mary bar, with not only fancy pickles but charcuterie!  Guests chose from standard breakfast, duck and waffles, banana bread French toast, and shrimp and grits.  Only wish that I had tried all of them but heard they were all good.  In particular, my husband, the pork connoisseur, was thrilled by the Neuske's bacon.  The service was excellent-- shout out to CJ-- and everyone had a great time.  I would highly recommend this place for events/parties."}
{"text":"Great food, wonderful beer selection, creative menu, and good service. 

I was interested to see how this Urban Tap compares to their South Side location, and it passed with flying colors.

Just a few suggestions, I didn't see any beer flights. I think they have a good selection of beer to make flights interesting.

Although the vegetarian fare is somewhat limited, at least they had a couple of options. They listed one veggie dish on the menu that is no longer available, and the waitress was a bit embarrassed it has not been removed. 

In all, a very good dining experience, maybe next time I'll bump my rating up by a star."}
{"text":"3.5 stars is probably most accurate for this review, but I gave it a 4 based on the delicious appetizers and good service.

The beer selection was substantial, which made most in our group happy. One did not drink beer so (after asking) we were pleased to see a nice cocktail menu. She loved her muddled strawberry cocktail.

The best part of the meal was the appetizers. We enjoyed the fried brussel sprouts with bacon, onion, and mustard as well as a very large soft pretzel and IPA beer cheese. The brussel sprouts and onions were crispy and perfectly salted, and the vinegar mustard was a good compliment to the rich bacon. The beer cheese was really creamy - it tasted nothing like the nacho cheese that often accompanies pretzels.

I was really feeling tacos, but was disappointed when I found out that there was no mix and match available. I shared the shrimp banh-mi and haddock tacos and found them to be subpar. The seafood was well cooked but, despite being topped with jalapenos, the tacos were not very flavorful. They needed more spice or sauce. The tortilla shells were hard and tasteless. 

I also shared the hot fried chicken sandwich. The chicken was cooked well and the plain white bread made for a delicious sandwich. I found the breading to be overcooked and not very spicy. The fries were the crispy kind, but there were too many small pieces and they were very salty.

The restaurants on Carson get very busy, so this could be a good option for those looking for average food and good beer."}
{"text":"This place has a good atmosphere BUT the food I ordered..eh. We went for lunch and I ordered the pirogies because you can't go wrong with pirogies, right??? WRONG. No amount of sour cream could salvage these things. Along with the mystery meat that the meatballs that came with it were made of, I've never tasted anything like it, and I mean that in the worst way possible. The texture of the meatball was that of a sponge. Gagging just reliving the experience. On another note I ordered the yogurt parfait also and that was great! So the whole entire meal wasn't bad. Probably won't be back for brunch again, and if I do I for sure won't be ordering that meal."}
{"text":"Urban Tap had the best Bloody Mary I've ever had!!  The Bloody Mary bar was solid!  We came here because I heard that UT had one of the best brunches in the burgh, and I thought it was very good. 

I ordered the Omelet with sausage, peppers, and onions and it was very good.  It was served with a small side of diced potatoes.  The portions were kind of small, and the food was good...but I don't know that I would say \"best brunch in the burgh.\"

We had a large party (9 people) and the service was a bit slow, which is unusual for UT.  Great atmosphere and great draft list!  I don't know that I would return for brunch, however."}
{"text":"I had the truffle Parmesan bacon kettle corn to start for half off. Man. That is good. Salty and sweet and savory and cheesy, wonderful unusual starter! Then the bison burger. Beautifully cooked and excellent flavor. Would recommend !!!! Also super cool decor."}
{"text":"So we stopped in to check out Urban Tap last night. We had a large group and when we showed up the place was really packed. We were about to leave and then I ran into our server Bear and he really took care of us. He was able to accommodate our large group into a small booth. Bear was on top of everything great server. He remembered everyone's name and drinks. I just wanted to say Thanks again Bear!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with some coworkers and we had a great time. The restaurant is gorgeous, really modern with tons of seating. We started off with the pretzel and bier cheese risotto which was INCREDIBLE. I highly recommend. I got the fried chicken sandwich as my lunch with a side of Brussels sprouts. I thought that both of these were really heavy on the oil/butter. Otherwise, they were good- but the grease was a little overwhelming and made my stomach hurt. Although my experience for lunch wasn't the greatest, I would def come back again to try some other items."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak salad over here.but It was only 4 small pieces of beef like the tea spoon.that is not worth for $16.never again"}
{"text":"I was very impressed by the excellent food, beer selection and service. I tried the Sun Dried Tomato Mascarpone Ravioli, which I enjoyed, but thought the portion size was small. 

Because we were there for the happy hour specials, my Dogfish Indian Brown Ale was $2 off, a great value. 

The Brussels Sprouts here are very good, I recommend them."}
{"text":"The place looks very inviting and has a cool interior, in which the bar with one hundred or so beer tabs takes center stage. They also do cocktails which are pretty decent. The food was very disappointing though. The best was the brussels sprouts with bacon and parmesan, while the wings, pork belly sliders and fries all left a lot to be desired. The service was good."}
{"text":"Great food that came out fast! Our server was also great! Looking forward to coming back for brunch and dinner again to try more things! The craft cocktails were some of the best that I have ever had. Pretzel and cheese was delicious."}
{"text":"First of all let me say that the service has been awesome the last three times I have been here. Our server is always friendly and checking with our table frequently. I came here once for dinner, and twice for some apps and drinks with friends. Service was awesome each time. Last time we went, my boyfriend ordered southern tier's IPA, which is 7.3% alcohol. He received it in a 10 oz small glass and asked why it was in a smaller glass (we drink a lot of beer and know that it is usually served in a 16 oz pint glass). We were informed by our server that beers over 8% are served in a smaller glass. My boyfriend then showed her that it wasn't 8% ( in a nice way of course) . She then apologized for her misunderstanding and have him his next round for no charge. Just an example of their awesome service! 

The first time I went, I had a chicken sandwich and thought it was full of flavor! Last month, I ordered their Brussels sprouts appetizer.. Fried sprouts, bacon, Parmesan cheese and balsamic reduction... Mhm! I loved it! Two nights ago I had their sliders- three mini burgers topped with tomatoes, red onion, lettuce and garlic aioli. They were served medium well, weren't as juicy as I like, and the garlic aioli wasn't as tasty as I had hoped , but they were really good. 

Now for the best part- their beers! Each time I went they had awesome beers on tap. Currently. They have Elysian brewing punkuccino pumpkin coffee ale ... Pumpkin and coffee in a beer ?! So good!!! It was served with a brown sugar rim which complimented the beer so well! It was smooth, tasty and easy to drink! Everything I want in a beer! 

Awesome place! Good food, Great beer, Great service, and perfect location!"}
{"text":"I was incredibly surprized by this place, the fried chicken and waffles was one of the best I've had! 

The PORK BELLY SLIDERS, aren't sliders at all but they were so delicious! 

Only reason it's not 5 stars is I ordered the AVOCADO & EGGS and didn't really enjoy it."}
{"text":"I've had good experiences at Urban Tap, ranging from brunch, to happy hour, and to a group birthday dinner. They have a strong beer selection and cheap PBRs!

For brunch I've had the Eggs Benedict and the Chicken and Waffles. Both good choices - although I did put hot sauce on both for some added flavor. I think the favorite item on the menu is the brussel sprouts. They are cooked with bacon and make a great app for the table!

Downfall is the prices can be a bit more than some of the similar places in the southside and I've been there a few times when the service has been less attentive due to the crowd. Because it is a bit more upscale it does bring a more mature crowd than other Southside places, so it's certainly worth a try if you are on Carson St. Thurs - Saturday or any weekend morning!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 Stars I would. The service was absolutely terrible and it wasn't even busy. The waitress never wrote anything down and forgot almost everything. She also forgot one of our orders and then 30 minutes later brought out the wrong order. The food was burnt and dry. 

Man do I miss Buffalo Blues"}
{"text":"Just went to Urban Tap for the first time today. Loved it! Our bartender  was fantastic, she made us hot cider drinks. Yum! They were perfect for such a cold winter day. 

I liked the decor, and they had a beer selection unparalleled in the burgh. I love craft beer, so it was right up my alley. 

We had brunch and the food was great. I can't wait to come back for Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cool and they have some unique food to coose from.
Service can be spotty at times."}
{"text":"I was there Saturday night for a hockey game and dinner. Thankfully it wasn't to busy I was there with a date. Kim waited on us and was very nice and helpful. The food was amazing.  It turned out to be a great night for her and myself."}
{"text":"Walking around Pittsburgh with family and friends and decided to stop in! Every single person we were with enjoyed their dish. The food, apps, and drink choices are abundant and have variety enough for everyone to find something they like! I myself had the shaved rib eye sandwich- OH MY. It is the most delicious thing I have ever ate, no lie. The meat was so moist and tender. The roll was fresh. The sandwich includes a beer cheese and garlic aioli which are two of my favorite toppings. The house tator tots are shredded hash browns fried to perfection. The wings are fried in duck fat so they fall apart as soon as you pick them up to eat them. The beer selection is full of variety for those drinking beer. There is house cocktails as well as wine selections. If ever back in Pittsburgh I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"The space is really rustic and wonderful but there is something off with the acoustics...it is LOUD LOUD LOUD in there. I had to shout across the table just to have a conversation. 

We all ordered a few apps and meals.

Mushroom Poutine: This is not Poutine...there were no cheese curds, no gravy...a real disappointment. The blue cheese really takes over and over powers the taste of this dish so much so that you cannot enjoy the truffle oil or wild mushrooms. The fries themselves were good, however...very crisp.

Short Rib Nachos: These were just weird. The chips were deep fried and covered in candied jalapeño queso which had absolutely no flavor and it was so sparse . The lime napa slaw just gave the whole dish a weird lime flavor that was not pleasant. The pico de gallo on top was cold and flavorless as well. 

Grilled Romaine with Salmon: This dish was pretty good...my only complaint is that a large portion of the dressing (both caesar and balsamic reduction) was added to the dish which made for some pretty soggy grilled lettuce. But the salmon was very, very good. 

They also were out of Pinot Grigio and out of the Lamb Bolognese and it was only about 5:30-6. 

Finally, we had the vegetarian pasta which was pretty good! The homemade pasta was perfectly cooked and had a light and fresh sauce on top with tomatoes. 

I just feel like there are so many good restaurants here now in PGH...this place needs to step their game up or at least taste the food they are sending out? I would probably not go back here again."}
{"text":"The worst service experience I've ever experienced. I have been working in the service industry for ages and never experienced such disgust from a staff as I did at urban tap. I arrived exactly at 2 I didn't know brunch was over at 2pm. However I told the hostess it would just be me and it's at 2pm. I could see if it was 2:05 2:10. Anyways she said do you know what you want I said yes, she proceeded to ask a co worker if I could be seated which I didn't see the big deal it was 2 and there were people who just sat down and haven't ordered yet. The server said she would ask the kitchen then, then the hostess said it's ok you should be fine. I ask the hostess if I could sit at the bar. After being ignored by the bartender who was very rude. I told him I would like the burger on the menu. He said I can't order it's pass two I said I cAme at 2pm the hostess said I could order which she confirm with a server. He gave me the most disrespectful look and said who told you that? With an attitude, which I gave him back an attitude. I repeats what I said to him, he went to ask some guy who was on his phone at the bar, I have no idea who that was but if it was the manager I would say shame on that person. I just walked out, because not only have I gotten the worse reviews from my fellow co workers and friends in the industry I still insisted on trying. I love to try new restaurants and review them and of course post them in Instagram. It was my first time and let me tell you that I will never recommend this place to anyone. I've worked so many restaurants and hotel and we never turn back people at the exact time. If the restaurant closes 10 and people come at 10 we still seat them. Your running a business to exceed your customers expectations whether it be by service or food and to what I have heard you guys lack none. Not only will this be a awesome pre-shift convo at work, this is definitely a reason for me not to recommend Urban Tap!! 0 for me."}
{"text":"This place was delicious. Their donut holes were more like beignets but they were light and doughy and not heavy at all. I got the classic breakfast and a side of Belgium waffles (aka, I got 2 meals). I wasn't able to finish them but that's ok. The sausage I got with the classic breakfast was definitely homemade and wasn't greasy at all. And those Belgium waffles were almost as good as the ones in Belgium itself! Perfectly sweet and a little crispy, just the way I like it. No ice cream on top tho haha"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant/bar with TVs for watching games, an attractive bar and big windows for people watching on Carson street.  They have an interesting looking menu, but it was early so I opted for a small plate.  The cheddar macaroni was very tasty.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Will probably try again for lunch or dinner some time."}
{"text":"We went here for Sunday Brunch. It was pretty busy when we arrived, but we had checked the No Wait app prior to coming and it said there was no wait for a table. Imagine our surprise when we arrived and there were 5-6 parties in front of us. The hostess just said \"oh...we don't update that.\" So, we had to wait 20-30 minutes. We had already traveled over there and didn't feel like searching for somewhere new. 

The food was average- perfectly fine brunch food, but nothing to write home about. My friend asked for cheese on her eggs and they just threw a kraft single on top. I think this is the first time I've ever seen a restaurant serve a meal with a struggle slide on top. 

Overall, the experience was not great. 3 stars is pretty generous. Maybe they should stick to being a bar and forget about food until they want to take it more seriously."}
{"text":"Yum! Went here for the first time for their weekend brunch. My in laws were celebrating their anniversary and specifically asked for a place with good Bloody Marys. I saw the reviews of their Bloody Mary bar and we decided to check out Urban Tap. The Bloody Mary bar did not disappoint. They serve your drink and you can pick your accoutrements, ranging from olives, carrots, and salami to fried mac and cheese bites and grilled cheese sandwiches (!) It costs $8 for your first BM and then $6 for each one following, which I thought was totally worth it just for the little plate of appetizers we got out of it. We also ordered a carafe of mimosas, which were decent - they could have been a little stronger IMHO. They have a whole menu of brunch cocktails if you are in the mood to imbibe. The food was pretty stellar - lots of hearty brunch options. I ordered the chicken on a biscuit - fried chicken and an egg on a biscuit topped with gravy with a side of home fries. Everything was delicious, especially the fried chicken which had a nice crunch and was well seasoned. My only gripe was with the biscuit. I'm from the South and we do biscuits in a big way, so I was super excited to eat this biscuit... except it really wasn't a biscuit. Biscuits have flaky layers and are made in a specific way. This I would have called it a roll or a sweetbread. It was still delicious but a bit of a disappointment. The home fries were great and it was plenty of food to take home. The atmosphere was also lovely with the open air windows in front and football on TV - overall a good experience and I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday with a 530 reservation. I arrived early and was advised there weren't any reservations in their system at 530, only some at 600, none of which were the party I was meeting with.  Fortunately they were not busy, so securing a table was not a problem.  Interestingly, the person who made the reservation started receiving email alerts that her reservation time was approaching. We brought this to the hostesses attention, and she couldn't have cared less.

Regarding the food and drink...both were fantastic.  Because it was still under happy hour, our table ordered and shared 4 small plates, and each was a flavorful party in my mouth.  We tried the curry tofu, crispy Brussels sprouts, Mac and cheese, and sage maple popcorn.  

For my entree, I got the steak house burger, but substituted the meat Patty for the black bean/poblano Patty. It was tasty, but as with most bean based burgers, a little too mushy for a sandwich.  I don't know what was on the fries for seasoning but they were out of this world. 

Another great thing about the place is that, when we finished our meals, we hung out and chatted for a good while, and never once did we feel like we were in the way, taking up a table, or being rushed out. In fact, we were left alone to enjoy our conversation until we indicated we were ready for our checks. It was not to feel like we had to bolt right after eating.

One thing that really turned me off is that, because they have a daily rotating beer list, they have to print new menus daily. In a world where everyone is trying to be eco friendly, conserve as much as possible, and reduce the carbon footprint, printing menus daily is the opposite of going green and I'm surprised and disappointed that this is happening.  I asked the waitress what they do with the menus when they swap them put (because she was in the process of changing them when while we were dining) and she advised that they throw them away.  It's a real shame.

All-in-all, the food, drink, and service were great. The reservations and daily menu printing were very not great."}
{"text":"Def worth the trip back!!  Had the egg and bacon burger.  Food and atmosphere was great!"}
{"text":"I stopped by last night to check out the draft list, which was awesome. Bartender was inattentive so service was slow, despite it not being very busy. He served my last beer in a glass that had a huge chipped crack through the bottom of it. When I pointed it out, he dumped the remaining half of my drink into a new glass. I told him that I had asked for a replacement in case there was glass in the old one. He set it back on the bar and said, \"there's no glass in there\" over his shoulder as he walked off. Unacceptably poor service."}
{"text":"I've been in Pittsburgh for a month on business staying the south side. This is by far the best bat I've been to. Awesome beer (58 craft brewd on tap) awesome food and very friendly/ attentive bar tenders. A great place that I recommend for happy hour drinks as well as dinner and late night."}
{"text":"This place has an extensive amount of craft beer on tap and some very nice appetizers. unique things here which is great. The fried Brussel sprouts were amazing! For dinner there are only a few choices (which for me is a good thing, that means they do things right instead of mediocre with lots of choices). I wanted the pork belly but they were out of it so I settled for the chicken instead. It was good but not great. I think it made have a bit to do with me eating so many apps and also really wanting the pork belly.

I would definitely try this place again though."}
{"text":"I love urban tap!! The food was delicious and our server was amazing. We ordered the beer cheese bacon Mac it wasn't my favorite and our server was more than happy to remove it from the bill!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection, but can't say the same for the food. My burger was burnt and hard as a rock. Disappointing for a $12-$14 burger. My fiancé's burger was burnt too."}
{"text":"This place is great.  We stumbled in here for dinner and were amazed at how great this place is.  I want to highlight that they have 7 or 8 taps exclusively dedicated to Founders Brewing Co., which is my absolute favorite. God help me if I ever manage to time a visit to Pittsburgh with a happy hour.  Frank the Tank.  Shutter the windows and hide your valuables everybody.  

Our server Sam was very friendly and helpful us navigate the menu with her own personal recommendations. My colleague settled on fancy sliders and I ordered the bison burger.  I can't remember ever eating a bison burger before, but I don't need to remember any other after devouring this one.  It was amazing, perhaps a Top 5 burger in my 36 year-old lifespan.  I was a bit drunk on Founders Breakfast Stout at the time, and I'm really hoping my enjoyment  wasn't just a case of 'beer goggles'. But I will be back.  And I will eat another bison burger.  Most likely slightly to moderately intoxicated again.

Our dinner entertainment was two dudes on guitar covering 90s and early 2000's songs.  Highlight of the set was their gig ender, a cover of Shaggy's 'Angel' song with a guest singer pulled up from the audience.  A very white gentleman who was absolutely spot on imitating Shaggy.  Awesome way to end a great trip to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Visiting town for a few days and the bartender recommended the Bison Meatloaf with mashed potatoes. It was fantastic and hit the spot. They've also got a great beer selection."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure at first about the hipster vibe but the food and service were excellent. Enjoyed sitting outside people watching and sunshine. The smoked Gouda Mac n cheese was incredible so creamy and delicious. My dining partner had kale Cesar salad that looked delicious full of veggies and cheese crisps. Large beer menu as well."}
{"text":"Fresh from a nice girls brunch, I wanted to spread the love for Urban Tap! They have a great brunch menu, but I would say it's more for adults. I had my 10yr old daughter with me; there wasn't much on the menu for her so she ordered the sour cream donuts. The donuts were AMAZING for my taste but not so much for hers as they aren't super sweet! (But trust me, you should get them). They don't have hot chocolate either, so she wasn't that happy haha but I was! I love that they have Arsenal ciders on tap, my favorite. Also always worth mentioning is that our service was great and the waitress was very nice! Lastly, the parking lot next door is super convenient if you can snag a spot! I am excited to try Urban Tap again minus my daughter and see what else they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Review based strictly on having a drink. 

First Impression: Visually it makes an impression, clean and very huge tap in your face when you walk in. Huge projections of sports on the wall, what looks like I million beers on tap, craziness!

Service: Immediately greeted by what I assume was the manager, very friendly and offered us a table, we opted for the bar. Grabbed one beer, the gentleman behind the bar was courteous, asked if he could help and got us our drinks immediately. I really cannot complain,

Atmosphere: It was a Monday night, not exactly the busiest of days but the bar was fairly full and a couple of people at tables with food. Enjoyable level of noise, not exactly quiet but no music blasting overly loud. Very industrial looking, I like the metal bar top. 

Drinks: Selection is amazing, 50 or maybe 50+ beers available. Someone else mentioned that the selection isn't much different from what other local bars are offering?!?! I honestly beg to differ. Definitely not the case, there are are so many things on tap if there doesn't seem like a different selection you need to start brewing your own beer. Grabbed a Stone Enjoy By 2.14.16 Black IPA as well as the Unfiltered IPA version. A great relief to see these on tap here. A lot of founders stuff on tap, also, if you can't find something you like, maybe you should stick to drinking something other than beer.  

Price: Two short pours (at approx. 9% ABV) for $15 all in. Not bad, not cheap, but it's just a normal price. Coming at happy hour would really be worth it weekdays 4:30-6:30 to get $2 of drafts. 

Restrooms:  Didn't really need to urinate this trip unfortunately. 

Overall: I'll be back. I don't venture out to Southside that much but I think I definitely will considering Urban Tap's beer selection."}
{"text":"We went for brunch and I was super impressed with the beer selection and service and would definitely come back again for drinks. I wasn't as impressed with the food- the tortilla with Manchego was surprisingly lacking in flavor. However, the beer cheese dip that my friend got later was pretty good so I wouldn't be against trying the food again."}
{"text":"I really want to rate this one higher, but I just can't do it.  It's on the low end of a 2.5 for me.

Why I want to rate it higher...  It's a great concept and a great space.  Large and open with a rustic industrial vibe.  The front wall of windows opens when the weather is nice and they have a great selection of beers and other drinks.  I was super excited about the Bloody Mary bar; which has potential, but wasn't executed right (see below).  The menu is inventive and the dishes look pretty; but again, are lacking in the execution department.       

Why it's down to 2.5 in my book...  For starters, the service.  Yikes!   We reserved for a party of 15, which they accommodated by sticking some tables together and packing 16 chairs in - like sardines.  Good thing two people didn't show up, cause we were on top of each other.  We were also on top of one of the high top tables behind us.  And by on top of, I mean chairs touching, can't get out of your seat close.   This situation also blocked in a corner table, so the guy behind me kept having to get up to let them seat the table and let people out.  Then there were the Bloody Mary's.   It took 30 minutes (not even joking) to get the first round and by then, there was a run on the condiments bar.   The bar part took forever because nothing was labeled and there were no serving spoons other than skewers.  Not sure how you dish out celery salt, horseradish, and tobacco with a skewer.   There were apparently grilled cheese sandwiches on the bar too, but they were gone by the time I got through the line and they were never refilled at all while I was there.  Which was a long time. Table service continued to lag throughout the meal, so we were there over 2 hours for brunch when it was all said and done.   Finally, the food.  It looked great and I wanted to order everything on the menu.  My chicken and waffles though, was lacking.   The chicken was bland and dry.  The waffle was good, but I needed a little more syrup.   

Overall, just lackluster.  I might give it another try non-brunch, but this wasn't a great first impression."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time at The Urban Tap and I loved it. I had thought about going there numerous times before, but never jumped in. 

We arrived around 6:15pm - we were able to get street parking on S. Highland. Once we got into the restaurant- we were offered a table outside, a high top, or a circle booth table. We choose the booth table. The forecast called for rain and I hate high top tables. 

Their happy hour runs from 4:30 - 6:30pm, so our waitress asked if we wanted to start with any drinks. My friend ordered the original margarita and I ordered the Katy Berry cocktail (Raspberry absolute vodka) and muled strawberries. Once we ordered our first drinks - we decided to order awesome beer list for the next round. They have 99 beers on tap! 

Since it was still before 6:30pm - some of the small plates were half off, so we ordered some appetizers. We ordered the pretzel & the nachos. For our entrees, my friend ordered the general tso cauliflower and I ordered the Mac & cheese. 

The only downfall was that all our food came at once! We started with the traditional apps (pretzels n nachos) and then moved to the other entrees. I enjoyed all of the food and would get it again. 

Heads up! It does get busy during Pens games, but how I loved the atmosphere! 

I also want to give a shoutout to our waitress Kiresten- she was awesome. She was so friendly and got us whatever we needed. She also loves soft pretzels, so we got to talking about twistburgh. I hope that I can request to sit in her section for my next visit. 

I will definitely be back to visit The Urban Tap soon!"}
{"text":"This place is nasty. Waited exactly an hour for food - appetizer came out at the same time as our entrees - which were just okay. There was actual shit on the floor in the bathroom. I'm so annoyed and disgusted."}
{"text":"Great job Yelp!  Thanks to some excellent reviews, we decided to come here for our annual Pittsburgh trip.  The food was top-notch.  I had the Croque Madame which was decent, but the belle of the ball was the French Toast!!!!  It tastes like a butter-glazed donut.  It was probably the best french toast ever!!!

Service was fun and friendly, as well.  The ambiance was eclectic and hipster-ish.  I highly recommend this as a brunch location."}
{"text":"Admittedly, I don't remember if I've ever stepped foot in the Southside location, but the Shady location is the best! I'm a sucker for a fabulous aesthetic and Urban Tap knocks it out of the park. I've only come for brunch, but all three instances have made it my favorite brunch spot. I mean, a great bloody bar and a mimosa flight??? Who can resist that? Though just a tad pricy, I think the cost is right for the quality of the food and drink that you get. I think it's hard to have a bad experience at any place that blares Louis Armstrong radio. 

Go for brunch. Get the avocado and eggs!"}
{"text":"Love the vibes here! I am in PA on business, so I walked to the urban tap from my hotel and got a table for one. The super nice server sat down across from me and chatted a bit and told me about the dinner/drink menu before taking my order! 

The windows were all open to the street, which made the atmosphere really open and enjoyable. My beer was the perfect cold temperature, and my mac and cheese was delish! 

Loved this place, the people, and the food! Check it out :)"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to get brunch this past weekend at The Urban Tap and I was very happy with my first experience here. We made reservations for 11 o'clock and that was a good call on our part, because the bar and tables filled up quickly after our arrival. If you are worried about parking, there is a parking lot right next door which I was lucky enough to find a spot in. The service was great, the food was great and I cannot forget to mention the new mimosa flights they are now offering. The manager actually suggested that I get it and I am really happy he did! The flight was $12 and it came with mango, blueberry, strawberry and regular of course! If you order the carafe of mimosa that will cost you $14 and its just your average mimosa. Why not select the option that gives you some variety. Let me also add that they were not stingy on the booze. That is a win win in my book! Enough rambling about the booze. If you like avocado, I highly suggest getting the avocado and eggs ($11). It comes with poblano pepper hash, corn and black-eyed pea salsa, poached eggs and crispy tortilla chips. Everything tasted so fresh and left me feeling full and satisfied. They definitely do offer a lot of options on their brunch menu and that is nice for a change. If you are not a mimosa fan, you might enjoy the bloody mary bar. If you are in the mood for something sweet, you might enjoy the french toast or Belgian waffles. Make this spot your next stop for brunch!"}
{"text":"Obviously fantastic and reasonably priced beer selection. Beautiful decor and wonderful staff. My only complaint is that the food is a bit pricey for the how much you get. However, their shrimp tacos are one of life's greatest pleasures and I'm dying to hit them up for brunch one of these weekends."}
{"text":"Margarita is weak, cannot taste any tequila at all. Brussel sprouts are solid though."}
{"text":"Went for dinner. Good beer selection and food. Menu had a lot of different options. Appetizer and meals were both delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I went here last night for dinner with my husband and some friends. I had heard great things, so I was looking forward to trying it. 

The atmosphere inside is very trendy and unique. The weather was terrible last night so it wasn't that busy and we didn't have to wait at all. 

Even the way they print their menu and drink menu is unique. Their drink menu is printed to look like a newspaper. They have a great draft selection. 

I ordered the Mac n cheese as my entree along with a side of fries. They had a few vegetarian options, but I do wish the options were more varied. They had a sandwich and tacos but both had portabello mushrooms - and I'm not a fan. 

However, my food was delicious! The portions were plentiful. The Mac n cheese was under the \"small plates\" but it was still very large and more than enough for my entree. And the fries were so so good! Very well seasoned. My husband got the bison burger and said it was delicious as well. 

Overall it was a great experience. Their prices are a tad high, but the portions are large so you do get a lot for your money. They are supposed to have great brunch, so I look forward to coming back to try their brunch options."}
{"text":"Excellent place for brunch! They have a very unique menu with a lot of choices. I got the merguez and pierogi hash, mostly because it had lamb which I loved (a little bit on the undercooked side but safe to eat). The kale and vegetables were on the saltier side but it balanced well with the pierogies. I ate with a group and we also shared some donut holes which I wasn't a big fan of because it was very greasy. Prices are good for the amount and quality you get and there's also a lot of seating so it's good for groups."}
{"text":"The waitress was OK, not really enthusiastic or anything. My food sucked. The mac and cheese was not flavorful at all, and the salmon entree was just blah as well. The scenery of the restaurant is nice, but I wasn't too hyped up after I got my food."}
{"text":"Great casual atmosphere with great selection of beer and cocktails. Excellent service every time and the food will not disappoint. I highly recommend ordering a few items and sharing because when you see what's across the table you just might get jealous."}
{"text":"If you want to be ignored, listen to your bartenders complain about their lives, enjoy a marginal selection of draft beers, and have that true crap Southside experience, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer and ciders on tap and vegan menu options!"}
{"text":"really great atmosphere with a great selection. The food is pretty good though nothing absolutely spectacular. Its a great place for a night out or to grab a bite with some friends. The staff is always nice and I've never waited too long for a meal. There something for every kind of drinker here as well so you need not worry there. Overall a great place to stop and get something if you'r not looking for anything too wild and just want a good old fashioned tap house."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go in the South Side. 

I don't get there often, about 4 or 5 times a year, but always look forward to it. The atmosphere is great. Very spacious, clean, and comfortable. Lots of brick, and the \"re-claimed wood look\" inside.

They have a great Happy Hour, with half-off small plate appetizers, and (I think) $2 off drafts. There are 2 must have appetizers, which are frankly not something I'd ordinarily order at a HH. First, the Parmesan Truffle Popcorn is amazing! It's $2.50 at HH, and I can't get enough of it. Pairs great with a beer. Second are their Brussel Sprouts. I've had them at most of the big steak houses in the city, and Urban Tap's are better than any others that I've had. They also have excellent wings. Nicely cooked, meaty, and flavorful. I've also had the fish tacos, and the carnitas tacos, and both are good, but not spectacular. Their Korean BBQ fires were amazing, but they seem to have removed them from the menu. Hope they reconsider offering them again. The burgers and fish sandwich are both great choices. I'd say the food is a solid 4.5 stars.

What pushes the Urban Tap into a 5 star rating is the service. I've always had outstanding service from each server I've had. All have been very friendly, attentive, and quick. Special kudos to Chad, who is the bartender/general manager, for outstanding customer service."}
{"text":"We went for Brunch today and it compelled me to write a review immediately.  Quite possibly the best brunch and service that we have had in a long time.  Our best foodie experience of the weekend for sure.

Upon walking in, we were greatly promptly by two different people and told that we can have a seat wherever we would like.  We chose the bar which was obviously a great decision because it was some of the best service ever.  Seriously. 

We decided to try a few different options since we haven't been here before, and every item was awesome.  I got the Urban BLT (candied bacon and jalapeño cream cheese) and Lyonnaise potato... So scrumptious.  The bread was perfect too... not too hard where it cuts the roof of your mouth (which has happened quite a few times other places).  The hubby got the sweet potato pancakes and omg they were amazing.  He also got the Savory Waffle sandwich (maple Apple sausage, arugula, and arugula)-looked amazing but I didn't try it.

The space is pretty awesome too.  I love the huge tap right when you walk in (which oddly I missed initially).  With brunch they have bottomless mimosas for $8.00 and a Bloody Mary bar (think the first one was $6 but others after would be $5 but don't quote me on that).  

I definitely recommend this place... If the service remains as it was today and the other food is as great as the brunch menu was, the Southside has a new gem in this restaurant."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!  This has quickly become our neighborhood spot for great food and drinks.  Surprise #1:  Not your typical bar, this gastropub serves up some pretty tasty treats!  I crave the fried tofu sandwich - the crusty bread, pressed tofu, creamy avocado and bosaam sauce really play together nicely.   I recently tried the lamb burger, and I'm pretty sure I could eat the tzatziki out of a bowl...with a spoon...by itself (so delish!)  The burger itself is a generous portion of meat (I couldn't finish it all, and this is unusual for me)  and I would recommend ordering it medium rare - the meat is really fresh and locally sourced  - the chef certainly does it justice! With our many other visits here, we've tried the wings (Monday night, half price!!), mac and cheese (add pork belly, you won't be disappointed), steak sandwich (grilled hanger cooked to perfection), and pork nachos (super citrus slaw, fresh pico, and salty pork really sit together well on a bed of nachos) and saahside chicken dip- all have been super tasty.  Did I mention their fries are some of the best in the city? I have no idea what is in the frites, but order a side...or two... if it doesn't come with your meal!
Surprise #2: They have also recently added a stand out Sunday brunch, complete with bottomless mimosas ($14) and a bloody may bar ($8).  As an aside, Pittsburgh needs more bloody mary bars!  I would definitely recommend the Avocado and eggs, but order early, because they have run out of avocado on occasion!
What's more to love?  Surprise #3: Their libations.  Their amazing wine list (hello, Simi Cab and Mark West Pinot...on TAP?!) I've never had wine on tap, so this was a bit of a venture for me, but it was great!  They also have a rotating and very large beer list (you'll be sure to find something that suits your taste) and a fabulous cokctail list (our favorite: the Katy Berry)
Finally, and perhaps what has made our experience so great at Urban Tap, is Surprise #4: The wonderul service.  We have been to Urban Tap probably twice a month since it opened, and we have never had bad service.  Everyone, from the bartenders, to the waitresses, to the hostesses are extremely friendly and on top of their game.  
If you haven't been, now's the time to go! Let's hope Urban Tap is around for the long haul!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times and the food, drinks, and service are always good.  The place has a fun atmosphere and is a good place to meetup with friends or watch a game.

All of the burgers I have had here have been pretty good.  Not on the level of the best places in Pittsburgh, but still above average.  They also have some really good and unique appetizers like the general tsos cauliflower and fried brussel sprouts.

I would like to see them add some more options to their menu.  It is a very limited menu, and while they do most things very well, a little variety would be nice.

Update: they have updated their menu since the last time I was in. They took the focus off of burgers and have a wider variety of options now which I like.  I had the hot chicken sandwich and it was great."}
{"text":"Brunch was good! They offer mimosa carafes which are a little heavy on the orange juice but good. We got there early and got a seat in the front by the windows."}
{"text":"The food is unique, you can get a bison burger or ~curry cauliflower~ like, what? A little pricey, but probably the only place I'll order roasted brussels sprouts over fries as an appetizer! A good place to grab drinks with friends or brunch"}
{"text":"Three stars based solely on the 100(!) beers on tap and the cool layout of the place. But after looking at the closing time online AND on the door, which said 2am, we get there around midnight only to be told last call? At least change one of the times on the door or online to match what it actually is. I was so excited to try this place too. I'd understand if it was a slow night but including my party there was probably 25 people in there."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my time here. I'm not sure if it was because of the food, atmosphere or getting to hang out with Carrie W. :D 

The atmosphere itself was very nice, open and you felt comfortable. I love the open windows in the front to let everyone know down the block how much fun you're having, lol. 

I ordered a carafe (or two!) or Mimosa which was really tasty. As Carrie said, each carafe is $10 and you get a good 5 glasses from it. During brunch hours, you could also order by the glass at $2 so it evens out. 

For my meal, I decided on the shrimp and grits brunch. The plate had yummy shrimp, cheesy grits, pork belly crisp and a poached egg. I loved that the yolk of the egg seeped into the grits if that makes sense. They went well together. The shrimp was tasty as well as the pork belly. I've never had pork served like that but it was surprisingly good!

Service was just fine and I'm excited to head back! Maybe for brunch, maybe for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"The Urban Tap has great happy hour specials, both on food and drinks. The beer selection is always interesting and the staff is friendly. Their hot fried chicken sandwich is to.die.for.

This place would have five stars if they just changed their music. Honestly. I don't want to listen to the top 40 hits from the summer of 2016. Please play something different, maybe something a little edgier or just literally anything else (except country)."}
{"text":"Good service and atmosphere. A pretty nice place to hang out with friends on a Friday night. My favorite is their pulled pork sandwich served on a pretzel bun."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere to the place.  A lot of attractive servers. For some reason I'm really attractive to the font they use for their logo as well. Went last Saturday Brunch for bottomless mimosas. This particular morning was pretty mellow, . Too hungover to order any real food, although their menu was pretty impressive. I ended up getting up just getting the yogurt and fruit. The berries were very fresh but I suggested they should mix it with a vanilla yogurt over plain. I got bored with it and gave it to my friend. I enjoyed the set up of the place, the overall ambiance, but if you notice there are several random chairs that don't match the rest. Anyways, I would come back, maybe check out the food. Very chill environment. They had a ton of drafts too which was cool. And a secret plus is there were outlets basically every third seat at the bar. The only real disappointment of the place was the one cocktail I ordered: The Frequent Flyer. With Gin, Berenjager, orange, cherries, pineapple juice, and club soda, it seemed like my dream drink but the cherries were so overwhelming all I could compare it to is cough syrup. However, the place is fairly new so I'm sure they'll work all the kinks out.

Overall, cool place, I'd stop by again, maybe lunch next time."}
{"text":"Had the Bison burger, it was great. Friendly staff and 40 taps! I little pricy but quality always is. I recommend stopping in for lunch."}
{"text":"I come here for happy hour A LOT!  They have 1/2 price appetizers and discounts on drafts. There is a very decent selection of craft beers here and their food is so delicious!  I haven't had anything I wasn't delighted with.

Pro tip: there is a parking lot right next door."}
{"text":"What happened to The Urban Tap I used to love?

I used to be a huge fan of The Urban Tap, but maybe everyone else is too which is why they've reduced portions, changed bacon, and increased prices.

Even just a few months ago our mimosa carafe was $14.  Now the price has increased 30% making in $18.  My initial shrimp and grits picture looks nothing like what the shrimp and grits looks like now.  I've ordered the most recent shrimp and grits and it's paltry in comparison.  I was also amazed with the butcher block bacon in my initial review a few months ago.  Whatever bacon they use now pales in comparison.

I came with a party of 10 to show some friends out of town the delicious food Pittsburgh had to offer and the hostess was not too happy about that.  So I'd say if you have a larger party, The Urban Tap may not be the place for you.  However, everyone in my group seemed to enjoy their meal.  All in all, compared to what I used to love about The Urban Tap, whatever changes they've made have made them just \"eh ok\" in my book."}
{"text":"I've been a few times for drinks and the space has a cool vibe, but recently went for Sunday brunch. Place opened at 11, we were some of the first there and had to wait about 30 mins for our food. 

I got the eggs benedict (never a question when it's on the menu) and I was turned off by how salty the biscuit and cornbread were. The proportions of the dish were also off so I had trouble getting egg, biscuit and meat and sauce all in one bite. My friend ordered the same and we both were very disappointed. 

Others in our group got burgers which they said were good, but with the slow service and the disappointing dish I'm not sure if I'll make this a regular stop."}
{"text":"Why does this place need valet parking? Talk about putting a pig in a prom dress. This place serves wings and beer, that's slob food not fine dining. Just park your lazy ass around the corner or take a bus! Stop trying to make these places more highbrow than they are."}
{"text":"I'll admit it - I have a love-hate relationship with Urban Tap. On the one hand, I really like their vibe and ambience, but there's a good number of cons that make me give this place 3 stars.

To begin with, the service leaves a lot to be desired. The waitresses are either rude or too busy serving multiple customers. On top of it, they are very pushy when trying to sell you alcohol. I understand that bars make a lot of many off drinks, but you should also accept my decision not to drink alcohol if that's not why I came here.

Having said that, this place can still be perfect for certain occasions. They probably have the best fried chicken and biscuits I have ever had, which makes it a good brunch destination. Otherwise, their other items on the menu are fine, and not too expensive, but will most definitely not blow your mind."}
{"text":"I've tried this restaurant twice, once for Sunday brunch and once for dinner on a Saturday night.  For brunch, we got there shortly after they opened so it wasn't at all busy.  The service was really good, and the food was solid also.  The banana bread french toast was really delicious and more than filling (it's essentially a half of a loaf of banana bread), but seeing as this was after a night out, the carbs were welcome.  The waffle was just a waffle.  Nothing special.  For the price, I wouldn't recommend that particular dish.  For dinner, they use the NoWait app but they also have a reservation request system online, and the two don't seem to work together.  In fact, they never even got our reservation from online until we called three days later.  Not a reliable system.  The service was friendly and attentive, but we were curious to try a beer flight because of the sheer number of drafts on tap, and the waiter was pretty aggressive about telling us not to, that it isn't worth the money for just a taste of beer when you could have a whole glass.  Isn't that the point of a flight?  Whatever, as I didn't want to be shamed, I just ordered a whole glass.  Great beer selection, something for everyone.  The breads and spreads app was really good (even if it does come with Ritz crackers), and the pulled pork sandwich was decent (nothing special, but nothing to complain about).  We also asked about the beer cheese risotto, which sounded good, but the only thing the waiter could say was that the people next to us had it, and then pointed to the empty bowl on their table.  Overall, it was an interesting experience.  I'd go back for the beer if nothing else."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday celebrations! Glad we had a reservation, it was busy! What a beautiful place, exposed brick, wood, great overall decor. Big beer selection and great mixed drink list. I enjoyed a Moscow mule, had to essentially give a security deposit on the cooper cup which was fun. I got a house salad and the side of butternut squash risotto. Soo good! The risotto could have been hotter but the flavors where great. And a good mixed greens salad. A great place for friends either for dinner or just drinks for a fun night out where you can still talk to friends. Our waitress was also great fun and conversational but not awkward or annoying."}
{"text":"The happy hour deal is great. Half priced apps. I think we ordered four apps to make a meal for the two of us but portion sizes are so large you might want to order only three. Very modern, up market, but decent prices, large food portions, and (like most of Pittsburgh) a long and impressive craft beer list. Services is friendly and prompt.

A real find on the south side."}
{"text":"This is a new gastropub in the space that used to be Buffalo Bills.  It has been transformed from sports bar to gastropub, but still has enough TVs at the bar if you wanted to watch the games.  The draft selection is immense so it works if you are a beer aficionado.

I came here for lunch so no beer for me.  I had the fish sandwich was good.  Lightly battered and fresh.  Fries were good.

Service was slow, but it was lunch over the holidays so maybe they were just short."}
{"text":"When my husband and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night, at first I felt like we were older than everyone else. We're in our 40s and this is located right in the heart of the South Side bar and club scene. But then we noticed there was a wide range of ages. Phew!

The head hostess, was not welcoming and in fact, was downright unfriendly. I didn't get her name, but she was wearing goth-like eyeliner. Another couple waiting at the bar complained to us about how mean she was. Conversely, the bar staff was professional and hard working, and our server, Nate, was excellent. 

This place knows how to cook meat. I had the BBQ brisket burger (which fell apart but was still good) while my husband had the hanger steak burger. He was very happy about the great beers on tap, while I was happy that Arsenal cider was in stock. 

It was very busy and loud when we first arrived, but by the time we left, it wasn't as bad."}
{"text":"Our friends brought us here because they know of my love for craft beer.    As we drove up S Highland I was reminiscing about Buffalo Blues and Oh Yeah next door.    Turns out that the Urban Tap is in the old Buffalo Blues location.  But Oh Yeah is gone.   :(

This place has a very industrial and hipstery feel to it.   When you walk in you are greeted by the giant board with all 100 draft beers listed on it.   This was the highlight of my visit.

At first glance at the menu I was slightly off-put by the prices, but it's fitting considering how this neighborhood has changed I guess.

I got the pulled pork sandwich and it was pretty decent, but wasn't anything to really rant and rave about.    The beer selection and atmosphere are spot on.  The food was okay from what I ate.   Prices are a just a touch higher than what I'm used to.  But the service was pretty sad.     Since it's still a pretty new place, I will be back again in a few months to see if they get their issues figured out."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a large beer selection (and good food), The Urban Tap is your best bet in South Side. Their draft list is extensive, and always has something new to try. And, their bar tenders are generally knowledgeable and friendly. 

In addition to drinking at the bar, I've sat down to eat here twice. Both times were decent; the food is good but a little pricy. However, if you get a good server it's an altogether pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try the SPICY salmon poke. However, they did not say on the menu it was on crisps which I was taken aback from. I am used to poke bowls. However, my main disappointment was it was not spicy at all! It was sweet! Why call it spicy then? Very disappointed. Also, on each crisp (total of 4), there were barely two small pieces of the salmon. I would say this dish is a rip off.

I also ordered a side of fries and I have to say they were over cooked and hard when you bit into them. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The bison burger is awesome, I added some Tabasco, but I add hot sauce to everything. The collard greens and cornbread side is perfect. A great little portion size of each to have a taste of what would otherwise be sold as two separate sides. I also liked the beer selection and found a Dogfish Flesh and Blood that I have never seen before."}
{"text":"Wanted to head out for a nice brunch and Bloody Mary so we ended up at the Urban Tap.
Needless to say we were not disappointed! 
I got the Coastal Bloody Mary and Carafe of Mimosas. Bloody Mary was nice and unique if had horseradish infused vodka with shrimp, olives, and celery. Had a nice bite to it and it was perfect with the shrimp and grits I ordered. The grits were cheesy and creamy and there was a nice amount of shrimp. Even though it was tasty, I will have to say I was super jealous of my boyfriends brunch. He got the Benedict which was super delicious! Was a bagel with arugula topped with smoked salmon and poached egg. Man when I took a bite it was heavenly. I really want to go back to order that next time! 
My only complaint was the service a group of 10 girls were seated after us and got there drink order etc in before us which was annoying we had to wait so long."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp when in town for a Pirates game! We had brunch there & then ended up going back there Saturday night after the game; walking distance from our hotel! Loved the decor/architecture & overall atmosphere! Brunch was yummy & their drink selection definitely doesn't disappoint! Would definitely go back the next time we're in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"We were in need of lunch and happened to pass by this place while exoloring South Side for the first time. The menu and the ratings looked great so we decided to give it a try. We were seated right away and greeted by a friendly waitress. They have a huge selection of beers on tap, even one of my favorites: fin du monde, but since we had a cocktail with brunch and we were planning on having cocktails later we passed on the beer.

I chose the fried tofu sandwich and much to my satisfaction it wasn't deep fried; it was quite good and served on fresh wheat bread, with a tasty sauce.

If I lived in the area I think I'd become a regular at this place!"}
{"text":"Urban Tap tries too hard to be hipster. I took my parents there for brunch after church and they couldn't order with out asking the waitress 50 questions -- most of which she didn't know the answer to. It's a good bar for a variety of beers and I will admit they are the only bar that serves bumbleberry with blueberries in it the way that fat heads does.."}
{"text":"I stopped in for dinner and was surprised at the quality of the service and the preparation of the plate. I ordered the steak and fries . I believe it was called on the menu. The steak was very tasty and the fries and vegetables were enough to satisfy my hunger. My server was also fantastic with his knowledge of the menu and beer selection. It's a bit pricey but I would come back because of the quality and service."}
{"text":"This was one of the nicer places we stopped into while staying in the Southside Flats.  They had a solid beer selection, good happy hour specials, played good music and the service was very good.  I was very impressed with the General Tso's cauliflower appetizer, and I had a massive burger with a fried egg and pork belly.  Speaking of pork belly, it was a smart inclusion on numerous parts of the menu.  On the whole, we had a nice time spending the evening there on our first night in Pittsburgh, and I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"Great place. The atmosphere is good and the staff is friendly. Decent beer selection, I wish there was more local choices though. I will go back"}
{"text":"I went to Urban Tap late on a Saturday night. I expected the place to be packed, but it's surprisingly spacious inside. A lot of folks stood around the bar, but there were plenty of open tables as well. A bartender greeted me almost immediately after approaching the bar. All the staff members I interacted with were incredibly pleasant! Service was quick and friendly. 
 If you're looking for details about the beer list on the wall, they have a paper draft menu designed to look like newspaper with full descriptions. With so many unique and local options, I would highly recommend a flight. They are reasonably priced and include four 4oz pours. 
Overall, a really good experience. A lot of patrons, but more than enough seating and staff to accommodate. A great place to explore new beer! My favorite find was the Atwater Vanilla Java Porter :)"}
{"text":"We went to Urban Tap last Sunday for brunch. 3 adults and two children, both under 2 years old. Some \"trendy\" non-chain places will give you the side eye because of the kids. Not here though. In fact, the owner stopped by our table several times to make sure we were enjoying everything and to let us know there was a family restroom with a changing table to accommodate our little ones. This was quite refreshing to see this attention paid to the needs of patrons with families. They even have a kids menu!

As for the rest of the experience, I have no complaints there either. We had an order of the donut holes for the table. They are enormous, were just the right temperature, and were not super dense as you might expect considering the size.

Personally, I tried the Chicken on a Biscuit. It was very good. A nice piece of crunchy, boneless fried chicken on a good biscuit covered in sausage gravy and home fries.

Overall, it was a great day out and we will definitely return. Thanks again to all the staff for being so patient and welcoming to us and our kids."}
{"text":"Came for brunch and fell even more in love. Bottomless mimosas and awesome food selections. Sweet and savory selections for all your breakfast cravings. Great atmosphere and will now be my brunch go to. Makes for a fun southside adventure during the day."}
{"text":"Not your typical American gastropub restaurant! Food was great. 

 The charcuterie board of meats and cheeses was definitely the highlight of the meal. The fresh bread served with the plate was phenomenal.

I also had the vegetable muffuletta. I thought the green beans tasted a little strange on the sandwich, so I took them off to eat separately and was left with an amazing sandwich. The balsamic portobellos and roasted tomatoes made a beautiful pairing. I liked the side salad but the champagne dressing was a bit too oily for me and needed some acidity. 

I had the urban mule to drink, and it was a solid \"mule\" type drink but nothing special."}
{"text":"Urban Tap is a perfect fit in the South Side. Trendy, upscale and all about the delicious food and drink. I've seen tons of great looking posts on Facebook so I was excited to finally get there last weekend for brunch. First, I was thrilled to see on another review that they serve Arsenal cider, one of my local favorites! Otherwise their drink menu is quite extensive and filled with lots of local favorites. The brunch menu didn't disappoint either. I had the Avocado and Eggs and just wow. Amazing. I'd love to go back for lunch and dinner to check out their other options, pretty sure I saw something about Mac and cheese?!"}
{"text":"Small select menu of very well prepared and thoughtful dishes.  The flavor profile seems to be considered for each dish. 

I had the Alaskan cod sandwich topped with slaw and each component seemed purposeful.  The slaw was creamy without being gloopy, the batter was crisp and uniform, the roll was so rich and buttery.   It was simple and elegant and positively delicious.

This isn't processed crap thrown on a plate. This place seems to respect the ingredients a bit more than that.   

With a short select menu they don't over complicate your already stressful life. They provide flavor and quality...even to my good friend tofu.  

Do yourself a flavor...err, favor.  Try it sometime."}
{"text":"Very good food and nice atmosphere. Limited selection outside of their sandwiches but it's mainly a bar so that's to be expected. The service was fast and friendly and both the pulled pork and chicken sandwiches were very good."}
{"text":"Great beer selection & sassy bartenders. What more could you ask for?! We did not order food, but enjoyed talking with the bartender about the area & the local craft beers. Very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"It's been about 2 weeks since I actually ate here, but better late than never, right?

So I loved the setting at Urban Tap! It had that hip, dare I say, Urban vibe to it, and it was well done. Located right in the heart of South Side and conveniently next to a small parking lot, Urban Tap is, in my opinion the perfect spot for after work meet ups, happy hour, dinner.. whatever your mood may be.  

Our server was totally on point. He suggested the mojito for my drink and it was amazing. For my appetizer I ordered the Brussel sprouts (what else, right?) and they were great! Not the best Brussels I've had, but still really good. For my dinner, I ordered the chicken sandwich, again at our servers suggestion, and just like the Brussel sprouts, it wasn't life changing, but I liked it and of course cleared my plate (no sense in being wasteful, after all!). 

We definitely enjoyed our evening at Urban Tap and I'm already looking forward to our next visit :)"}
{"text":"This was a great find in Shadyside! The atmosphere was beautiful with there wall of over 100 beers on tap! The music played also enhanced our experience! The server was great, and our food was amazing! We shared a burger and a giant pretzel! The giant pretzel was great with a an amazing beer cheese sauce! The burger was great and cooked perfectly! We enjoyed our experience and would highly recommend! 

***neither of us are of age, and could not drink. But like I previously said there beer tap selection was impressive, and I'm sure there drinks were great!"}
{"text":"I came in for brunch with a group of girlfriends. Unfortunately brunch ended at 2 and we got there around 1:45. We were able to get a few orders of mimosas in before 2!!! They were great! 

I ended up ordering the bison burger and fries. The fries were good so was the bison burger. The bun was a little hard for me though. A couple bites in I ditched the bun. The server suggested getting the bison burger medium and he was spot on. It was very flavorful. 

What really stood out the most was our server! He was attentive and on point! Something I imagine is hard when you have 5 hungry women who've just guzzled 4 crafts of mimosas! 

Maybe next time I go back I'll actually get brunch!"}
{"text":"New spots on East Carson always seem to be a shot in the dark. They range from spectacular to meh. I was pleasantly surprised by The Urban Tap. The pub offers a wide range of foods and different cocktails, and I felt feeling a lot better about the spot than I had coming in. 

The Urban Tap has a massive draft list that is constantly changing. The draft list is so large, I didn't bother to find a bottle list (I'm not sure if there is one). In addition to draft beer, the bar also offers draft wine, which I've never seen before. I took a quick glance at the cocktail menu and that looked tasty too! 

My table started out with an order of Mac & Cheese to share. The plate was above average, with a light but satisfying smoked gouda sauce. It wasn't so rich that I was sick after a few bites, but a couple of forkfuls to share left me wanting more!

I ordered the Chicken Sandwich to start, the baguette is loaded with grilled chicken, avocado, siracha aioli, and red pepper and pineapple salsa. The sandwich was good, but not overly flavorful. For all the unique ingredients, I was surprised how blah it was. 

Everyone else at my table enjoyed their meal more. One of our party ordered the sliders, and I saw a bunch of those going out. I think next time, I'd stay safe with a burger, or try one of the salads--those look pretty tasty. 

Like I said, I was pleasantly surprised with the whole place. There is a ton of space, with a bunch of mixed table sizes for varying groups. On a Sunday evening, it wasn't too loud, but I wouldn't want to be there on a Friday/Saturday night. That being said, I think I'd give it another try for lunch or a weekend brunch."}
{"text":"We checked out this new establishment on a Tuesday early evening after work. It was a great experience! Very impressive tap list, and honestly the best beer menu I've seen in terms or organization and description of the options. Lots of good food choices, too. They have the menu categorized in small, medium, and large plates so you get a really good sense of how much food you're ordering, too. The options are more than just bar food; you can get mussels, salmon, etc., as well as burgers. Also a great playlist of music in the background. Servers were kind and very attentive. I suspect it will get totally packed and crazy on a weekend, but for a weeknight dinner it's a great choice!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant and excellent service. Our table enjoyed the French toast (which was apparently amazing), the eggs Benedict (which truly was yummy), chicken and waffles, and the burger and egg. Everyone was happy. They even provider old style bacon and eggs for my 6 yo. The service was excellent. Incredibly accommodating and hospitable. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here last week with my fiance and another couple for dinner.  We arrived shortly before 6 to a pretty dead restaurant.  The wasn't much decor so to speak of from here by that was not a bad thing as the place seemed clean, modern and had a number of TV's around.  There was also a bar on one side of the restaurant which had a list of their draft beers above it as well as their ABV's. 

Shortly after we were seated the waitress came over and gave us a beer list and informed us that happy hour was until 6, so if we wanted to get in some small plates for half price that we should do it then.  We obliged and ended up ordering the wild mushroom poutine and the mac and cheese with pork belly even before the other couple got there.  After ordering the food I finally started looking harder at the beer list.  They had a decent number of drafts (25 or so?) as well as a number of seasonal drafts (5) which was impressive to me.  This list much like the sign above the bar had the ABV of the beer but not the price.  As someone who likes to try new beers this is frustrating to me as I don't want to accidentally order that $10 or $15 beer only to hate it.  In any case it didn't really affect my visit other than to have me order a beer from a brewery that I knew was not that expensive.  Within a reasonable amount of time, our food was delivered.  I wouldn't really have called the fries that we got poutine as they didn't have the gravy on top of them which is a quintessential poutine ingredient but they still tasted very good.  The fries were crispy, the mushrooms tasty with the gorgonzola pairing perfectly against the earthiness of them and my favorite part of all was the truffle oil.  The mac and cheese was also good with the pork belly being fried to give it a nice crispiness in addition to its good, natural flavor while the mac and cheese was loaded with great tasting gooey cheese.  Finally whenever we had finished up our appetizers the waitress came around to see if we were ready to order our entrees and we were.  Since the portion sizes of the appetizers were quite large and I had eaten a lot of each, I ended up going with another appetizer for my entree and ordered the Saahside Chicken Dip.  It is essentially a buffalo chicken dip with blue cheese in it and it came with fried naan to use with the dip.  The buffalo dip was good but not spectacular and I loved the fried naan chips which made this dish a little different than many others that I have tried.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  All of the food that I had was good, especially the truffle fries, and were nice sized portions as well.  I was also impressed with their large draft list but wish I knew what I paying for one before the bill came."}
{"text":"Me and my colleagues stumbled upon this cool spot. Cool/chill vibe, personality, and uniquely awesome food. We shared Poutine as an appetizer (oh, and bacon and fried egg on top of all that Poutine greatness??) Enjoyed a refreshing Moscow Mule as well and finally some fiery Pork Tacos that were bursting with flavor. Can't forget the \"patio\"/street-side seating on a day with lovely weather."}
{"text":"Urban tap has a cool atmosphere. The interior design is nice, including the wall design. I went with a group of 14 and they had no issue taking a reservation and organizing table space for us to sit together. It was for 10:30, although by 11:30 the place was filled up so definitely wanna get there early for brunch. 

The drinks are really good, with bloody Mary's and 4 fruity mimosas as the options including a flight for all 4. I stuck with a coffee since I was recovering from st Patty's day still. 

I ordered the eggs and avocado. I was not a big fan and wouldn't recommend it. It was a bit bland for starters. Also, the avocado was served as two separate halves but I had to slice out the inside which I was not a fan of. A pre-sliced avocado would've been better even though the whole avocado made for a nice display. Most other las enjoyed there's though. 

The server was great. She was really sweet and patient. With such a large order it took a while to get the kitchen pumping out the food but that wasn't an issue for us since we expected it."}
{"text":"We came here just as happy hour had ended on a weeknight but enjoyed a wonderful meal and a not overly crowded restaurant (though I'm sure it's packed during HH times). There are 100 beers on tap so it's almost too overwhelming to order, but the waitress was knowledgeable and friendly in helping us decide. I ordered the sesame grilled chicken sandwich which was honestly the best grilled chicken sandwich I have had in a very long time. It tasted fresh and homemade, and the flavor combination of the ginger sesame grilled chicken with the avocado, arugula, roasted red peppers, Sriracha, and grilled pineapple was truly scrumptious! The waitress told us that everything is made fresh to order, and we could tell. I got the house tots on the side and they were adorable-- hash browns cut into blocks (oversized tots, really) that were delicious too. We also tried the hawaiian pork egg rolls and they were just as yummy. Loved the restaurant ambiance and the chairs at the bar swivel and have a retro feel to them. I can't wait to come back and try it again on HH and to come for a brunch meal soon!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid place with creative drinks and a friendly staff. I've never had a bad experience at the Urban Tap."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Urban Tap and I'm glad I did.  The renovations done inside are great.  They really utilized the space well - lots of room at the bar and plenty of seating for your meals.  

I was slightly disappointed that the first two beers I requested, from the menu, were unavailable.  The waiter said they were waiting on the manager to reprint the menu and list only beers available.  I decided not to try for a third beer and instead ordered a glass of wine. During happy hour beer is half off and wine is $2 off per glass.  I believe that the small plates are also half off during happy hour.

Our waiter was very knowledgeable and helped steer me in the direction of the bison burger, which was pretty delicious.  I loved the jalapeno jelly on it mixed with the cheese and bacon.  I'd definitely have it again.  My side dish was the brussels sprouts and they were so tasty. The seasoning was great, and pretty addictive, because I shared with my table and no one could stop eating them.  

My one friend ordered the turkey sandwich and said that it was really good, especially with the melted brie.  

I look forward to coming back and having a beer or two."}
{"text":"Two of my girlfriends had a joint birthday party at this new(er) location of Urban Tap, and I was excited to check it out! We met up late Saturday afternoon, and I love that one of the birthday girls was able to reserve one of the large tables by the open windows in the front of the restaurant to hang out for several hours. The weather was gorgeous that day, so it was truly the perfect place to be hanging out.

Service was strong! As women came and left the table, our waitress did a good job of catching people when they arrived and making sure they had ordered beverages and food. I split the giant pretzel with my friend. It was soft and warm with a good accompanying beer cheese sauce. Though I wish that I could have enjoyed one of the many beers on tap, I had to stick with non-alcoholic (due to my pregnancy). However, I loved that my waitress was super helpful with my order and had the bar create me a custom fruity beverage. Yum!"}
{"text":"My friend suggested trying Urban Tap for happy hour last week, and I really enjoyed my experience there! The interior was very well done. Our waitress came and checked on us many times. My friend and I both drank wine and shared the Short Rib Nachos. They were absolutely delicious - very well seasoned, great flavor, and perfect ratio of toppings to chips. Even though Urban Tap is in a part of South Side that I rarely frequent, I would definitely be up for trying it again."}
{"text":"Cool looking place that came up on Yelp as having Gluten Free options which apparently means salads. 
Bar tender wanted to be elsewhere. Short pour on the wines. Lipstick on the glasses."}
{"text":"Good food, cool atmosphere. Serivice was very good. Boyfriend and I shared the bacon and parm sprouts, so delicious! We also had burgers, also really good, tasted like *good burger meat. My pulled pork and slaw could have had some more flavor but over all still good. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time at Urban Tap and I have to say that everything I had was good! I ordered a chicken dish that I must have misread because I thought it was going to be a grilled chicken dish. I've been trying to eat a little lighter so I thought it would be a good choice. What I got was fried chicken, covered in gravy with potatoes and sautéed greens. While it wasn't what I expected, I was not disappointed. The chicken was crispy and the gravy was flavorful. The potatoes I couldn't have cared less about but the greens were amazing. Some of the best I've ever had. I asked the waiter what was on the greens and he told me apple cider vinegar and red pepper flakes but there has to be something they are hiding! These greens were special and I am determined to find out the secret. My boyfriend got the pulled pork burger and had a pretty clean plate by the end. All around I loved my meal and was not upset that I didn't get grilled chicken!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night. The vibe is cool and it wasn't too crowded at midnight. Great beer selection and fast service. The free popcorn at the bar is always a plus. 

Good place if you want to get away from the college crowd"}
{"text":"Urban Tap is a solid 3 stars and a good addition to the South Side that I think will stick around for a long time.

Pros: 
Awesome lamb burger
Kitchen open late 
Generous Draft Selection (including local breweries)
Well-designed space 
Great people-watching 
Friendly service

Cons: 
No prices on Draft list 
Waitresses could know more about beer

The Urban Tap just opened a few months ago, and it has already made it into our list of places to go. Good food, good beer, good service, and good atmosphere is a tough combination to come by. This place also seems to toe the line well between restaurant and sports bar. The kitchen is open late, so we often end up here for a late dinner on weekday evenings. 

Overall, I'm pleasantly surprised by the food at Urban Tap. It's not fine-dining, but it's many steps above average bar food. I like the topping combinations including tzatziki sauce on the lamb burger, and avocado with pineapple relish on the chicken sandwich. The salads are stuffed with interesting greens and generous toppings. The chevre-spinach salad with candied pecans and pancetta is a winner. They have generous portions which make the prices reasonable, though I haven't tried the more expensive entrees. 

As with most South Side establishments, beware on Friday and Saturday nights. It will inevitably be a loud crazy bar with crappy service."}
{"text":"Good food and beer selection for all types of personalities and diets! And great deals like $9 for select beer/cider and a shot. Also very easy to make a reservation, I came here with a party of 6 and we had many choices for times for a reservation. Hard to find parking though on Highland. The cauliflower app was delicious and we all enjoyed our burgers. I recommend this place for meeting up with friends or happy hour!"}
{"text":"** Ambiance and wide drink selection definitely stand out. But food wasn't anything special.

Went here for my friends 21st bday on a Thursday night, and the restaurant was fairly empty. I ordered their house burger with no cheese and fries, as well as a drink (forgot the name but was red with a mint and had Bombay Sapphire). 

Service was on the slower end.. they also had to redo my burger because they accidentally made it with cheese the first time. My drink was on the sweeter side, didn't really taste the alcohol. One of my friends ordered the cider but said he didn't like it. 

Food was solid. The beef in the burger was juicy and not overcooked, but it was just a burger at the end of the day. The fries are a bit garlicy and tasted amazing the first few bites, but after awhile it gets old and greasy. Decent place to check out with a group... Perhaps best to go during happy hour if they have one?"}
{"text":"...a new addition to the Souse Side and a good one. Lots of stuff on tap, but there does seem to be a problem among these new places that seems bizarre. Why can't you list the prices? I feel uncomfortable asking as you'll always get a look from the publican like you're a cheap skate. Both Bocktown Beer and Grill do this and it bugs the hell out of me. You make a selection based on a lot of factors and price is one of them...this place would have gotten four stars otherwise..."}
{"text":"For brunch, it's a fun, but loud environment, perfect for talking about last night while sipping on a delicious mimosa/bloody mary/one of the various libations they offer. There's a parking lot beside of the restaurant, which is great if you're terrible at parallel parking like me. Free parking on Sundays in the lot. 

We ordered carafes of the mimosas, as I'm not much of a tomato juice fan, but the bloody mary bar looked interesting. I had the avocado and eggs: both eggs were wonderfully poached and delicately placed on top of both halves of an avocado. The poblano hash was decent, but I was expecting more flavor, or at least more of a kick. 

If you're down for trying eclectic spins on classic brunch dishes, try The Urban Tap."}
{"text":"Very nice sport bar with nice food
always busy.  if you like watching any kind 
of sports games that what you needed"}
{"text":"We stopped here during a rainstorm and were pleasantly surprised.

BEER: Very nice tap selection. Well selected and numerous. Best I've seen on Carson St. Easy to read tap list on the wall behind the bar.

FOOD: Delicious and varied menu. Had trouble choosing among many different entrees which all sounded great. The ones we did select were all superb.

DECOR: Beautiful and cozy bar and restaurant with nice decor. Varied seating, nice large bar area, and the front windows open up to provide a massive open view on the activity on Carson Street.

SERVICE: The waitress we had was extremely pleasant and efficient.

OVERALL: I've only been here once, but everything was spot on. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because it looks great and they had awesome beer selections, but the service was so strange that the experience was almost surreal. 
 
We walked in with 7 people and asked for a table.  The host said there would be a wait, which was totally fine considering our party size, but refused to give us any kind of estimate of how long the wait would be, other than \"it could be a while.  Anywhere  from 15 minutes to an hour.  I just don't know.\"  After trying a few times to figure out what \"a while\" meant, we decided to get beers at the bar while we waited.  
About 15-20 minutes later, we were finishing our beers and discussing how strange it was that the host refused to give us any kind of wait estimate, when he walked up behind us and said \"you know I can hear you talking about me, right?\"
We chatted about how it would be nice to get an approximate time, even if it was an overestimate, and he agreed at first, but said he didn't want to give us too much of a wait because he didn't want us to leave.  I told him that it wasn't his decision whether we stayed or left, and that we just wanted an honest estimate.  The host then started to complain to us about two girls sitting at a large booth who had apparently been there for a few hours, and had paid 45 minutes before, but hadn't left yet.
He then told us that a table should be ready when \"those two guys finally leave\" pointing and at a table of guys within ear shot. 
We decided not to take the table and leave, at which point he offered us 3 other occupied tables to try and keep us there.  I've never experienced such an unprofessional host.
Also, I find it really strange that there are no beer prices on the wall or on the paper menu.  Like most customers, I'd like to know about how long the wait is and how much I'm going to pay."}
{"text":"I dined here about a week or two after they opened so it does sound like it has improved somewhat since I have been there. I have been wanting to go back so I'd have a more positive review but time has not lent itself to that. Our server was nice enough but it took her 10 minutes to even come over to greet us and it was pretty clear that she had no idea what was going on. Frankly it seemed like no one knew what was going on-there was a 1:00 steeler's game that was going to be on and at 1:30pm they STILL had on ESPN 30 for 30 or some other program-whatever it was,it was not the football game. And the volume was incredibly loud! deafening is a good word to describe how loud it was. Enough people in the place caught on that we were obviously going to have to ask for the game...and then it took them another 20 minutes to figure out how to work the tvs. So I will say they had a nice draft selection. And the open air atmosphere near the window was nice that day. Our food....it could have been good with a few tweaks. I ordered the smoked gouda mac (no meat). 1. the server asked if I wanted chicken or chorizo-never stating it was an upcharge but asking like I had a choice to make that was included. I didn't want meat in it so really this wasn't an issue for me but I could see how someone else may be upset about the $3 upcharge without being informed about it first even though it's right on the menu). 2. The mac was rather cold. If it was heated it would have been really good but I never had the opportunity to ask for it to be reheated since I didn't see our server or any other server for the next 20 minutes. My boyfriend ordered the benedict 2 ways and he said it \"was ok\". Coming from him that means it wasn't very good. Also, they had bottomless mimosas for $8 which tasted like the alcohol was entirely left out. The server was ill informed as to when the mimosas stopped. Also, she kept me mimosas! At one point I LITERALLY had 4 mimosas in front of me and since I'm not a big fan of them to begin with, only 1 was partially finished. And then guess what happened? She brought over another! So now I had 5 mimosas in front of me.....and no room on the table at all for my boyfriend's beers! According to the server, they \"were trying to get rid of them.\" Exactly what you should tell a customer, however, being that they were clearly basically alcohol free, no wonder they were stuck with a lot leftover. Hopefully I'll get a better experience the next time I visit although,after this very odd and disappointing experience,I'm not sure when i'll make a return visit."}
{"text":"I was happy to see something open in this location after Buffalo Blues was gone but sadly this location has nothing on the South Side one.

I've come here a few times, typically just for drinks but have ate here twice. From the presentation to the taste it just doesn't compare. Also, having 100 beers on tap worries me about how often these barrels are circulating so I typically stick to something I know sells well.

You can't go wrong with the Brussel sprouts as an app and I personally enjoy the grilled chicken sandwich, it changes toppings/add ons with each season. 

The staff is friendly but it's easy to tell many of them are new, not very knowledgeable on specials or even menu items. More of a management issue I'd guess? Parking here can be an issue but they do offer valet. The location is pretty huge so even during a weekday happy hour it feels slow. 

This location still needs to find its footing and I believe they will! But for now it's just a 2 star review for me."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch! They were out of three items on the menu, all of which people in our group were going to order. However, no one was disappointed with their second choice."}
{"text":"Beer selection is great. 100 beers on tap. Had beer and nachos. Happy hour is 1/2 off drafts and $2 off small plates. Got nachos. They are really good. Aside from they are very small for the price $13"}
{"text":"I came here for a brunch menu item, not realizing brunch was only on the weekends. So I asked the waitress to to pick for me. She chose the brisket burger. And it's literally the best burger I've ever eaten. I travel a lot for work, and have had a lot of burgers, and this was the best! Bun was perfect texture, the taste was insanely good! If you like burgers, you have to have the brisquette!  I waited a little longer than I would have expect for the traffic, but it was completely worth it. Service is great too!"}
{"text":"Great selection of beers and good food.  The food menu is not very extensive, but they have a nice mix of entrees and burgers.  Service was a little bit slow, but not horrible.  The beer list is what makes this place worthwhile for me."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places, however as a vegan my menu items are very limited. Wide variety of beer and cocktails. On the pricier side for Southside dining."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I ate here two weekends ago around 2pm, on St Practice Day, the practice bar crawl the weekend before the real thing, and the place was packed. We had to wait over an hour and a half for our burgers and sandwiches, which is a little ridiculous, because how long does it really take to make 4 sandwiches and 1 burger? During this time, our waitress did not come by to check on us. Everybody found the food delicious, and since my chicken sandwich took another 10 minutes and was the last to arrive, they gave me an incredibly huge pile of fries. I appreciate that they tried to make up for the delay of our food with the fries, but would just have prefered our food to be brought to us sooner, since we were all starving and had to buy $1 pierogis from the event as we were waiting."}
{"text":"I've been to Urban Tap for brunch three times now. This past Sunday I woke up craving a Bloody Mary bar and when I realized I never wrote a actual review for Urban Tap my mind was automatically made up. I was so excited I rushed my boyfriend to get ready so we could get there as soon as they opened. 

Upon walking in the door I realized the Bloody Mary bar wasn't where it once was. I thought to myself surely they still have it so maybe it's moved. I quickly learned that they swapped the bar for 5 \"specialty bloody Mary's\". Which doesn't agree to their website whatsoever. Knowing they had 5 options I wasn't overly upset. That all changed as I read the menu further. 1 was a Bloody maria, 1 was a michelada, and 1 had a stout side car? So that left 2 options and one of those options was just a basic Bloody Mary. Needless to say it sucked and I wasn't thrilled.

Entree wise I went with the huevos rancheros as it is one of my favorite brunch dishes. Again, what a fail on their part. It tasted like can salsa poured into the bottom of a bowl with 2 tortillas, some short rib, and eggs. It had little to no toppings and if there was rancheros sauce I definitely didn't taste any. It was so utterly disappointing that I ate maybe 1/4 of it. 

I really want to like this place. I've tried it 3 times and each time it's something new that disappoints me. Other people seem to like it so I won't discourage anyone from trying it but please note the Bloody Mary bar doesn't exist if you are a bruncher who looks for that."}
{"text":"Stopped into this Urban Tap location on a whim having peeped the extensive draft list through the window, and I had the MOST delightful time. I sat at the bar and was promptly handed a list of 100 drafts which featured plenty of every style, and not too many light domestics taking up space.  The two bartenders working both went above and beyond during my visit. They offered me plentiful beer samples when I had a hard time choosing a drink, were SUPER knowledgeable about the menu and seemed genuinely enthusiastic about the food when answering my questions. I felt so welcome. Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I visited the urban Tap after work with some friends. Parking was really convenient for it being south side. When we got there, It was quite busy and does seem to be a great after work type hangout. We all go the Mac and cheese. I decided to add chicken on it which cost extra. The Mac and cheese by itself was good but was brought down by the chicken which looked great but was suprisingly dry. Beer selection exceeded my expectations with many local selections and craft brews. The drafts were nice and cold as they should be. I would definitely go there again but won't be getting that chicken."}
{"text":"Bloody Mary's are the absolute best.... Sunday morning brunch is a must... staff is friendly. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We've been to the Carson Street location several times and every time we go here it's enjoyable and we feel welcomed by the staff the entire time we're there.  The food delivers on what it promises which is to be tasty, well priced, of good proportions, and great in variety.  We'll go back every time we're in town."}
{"text":"Tried UT the past Saturday and was it was fantastic!  Got to the reservation early but we were promptly seated and our attentive waitress was at our table with water and to give her input on the expansive beer list. When the wife's first selection was kicked, the waitress suggested a couple of alternatives. We didn't feel rushed and she made sure we were happy with our selections before moving on. 
We got the Brussels app which were roasted well and had a nice balsamic glaze on them. Good size for sharing.  I got the cod sandwich which had to be one of the best fish sandwiches I've had recently. The fish was was moist and flaky and practically fell apart in my mouth. A far cry from the super jumbo mega fish that's been fried to a hockey puck consistently you get in some places. My wife go the lamb burger and couldn't stop talking about how good it was. She finished the whole thing, which for her is unusual.

If I had to point out one drawback is that it is very loud inside. Beyond the normal chatter you get at a place like this, the front windows were open. The breeze is nice but this place sits right on Carson street so you get s lot of traffic noise. The local bikers seemed to get a kick out of cranking on the throttle when they were stopped outside waiting for the light to change.  This happened enough times that it definitely seemed like they were making a point to be as loud as possible. Wouldn't stop me from going back but a couple of times the conversation stopped at most of the tables around us while we all waited for the bikes to pull away."}
{"text":"Urban Tap. Delicious. You know how you sometimes come into these environments and you are fooled? Great atmosphere. Cool location. Smartly designed. And then . . . The food is terrible? 

Yeah. 

NOT HERE. 

I looked down at the menu and saw a turkey sandwich with brie. Brie?? I knew something was different here, and I'll tell you what's different . . . A pub with quality quality food. I was very impressed with the food at Urban Tap. You obviously have to get the turkey, bacon, brie, sandwich. It's killer. 

I loved the atmosphere here. They have tables that sit right next to an open garage. It's urban designed with plenty of seating. I could sit in there for hours. 

If you're in East Liberty and can peel yourself away from Noodlehead for a minute (yeah, you know it's true), check out Urban Tap. It's a bit pricier but worth it."}
{"text":"Went to Urban during the week. It was half off bottles of wine. Perfect for a girls night out. The place was crowded but not overly. love the big flat screens everywhere would be great place to watch a game at. 
I like that Urban can be restaurant or a chill place to drink. 
 The waitress was very helpful on picking a draft from their menu. She even brought samples of some over to the table to try. Ended up with banana nut bread beer, it was amazing not too sweet but tasted like the name. 
Food- we had a cheese board  appetizer to go with our half off bottles of wine. So good. The different cheeses, crusty bread and  candied nuts were delicious. 
Main dish we all got a vegetarian pasta plate. The noodles are a homemade noodle bought down the strip. Seemed to be the only thing good about that plate. The taste was way too salty, would try something else next time. 
Next time I go prob going to try different   appetizers and drinks"}
{"text":"I'm a big Urban Tap fan - such a great addition to Southside.

It's one of the better places to watch a game in the neighborhood where you can get different food that the normal bar food, plus an excellent drink selection.  I've always had great service and the setup is perfect for large groups.  No pressure to leave after you've finished eating or order food at all if you are there just for drinks.

An unassuming choice, but I love their chicken sandwich.  Something about the grille marks with the soy glaze and sweet salsa...makes me so happy.  Love the brussel sprouts and their wings have improved since they first opened."}
{"text":"The beer is great. The pulled pork nachos are incredibly bland. My husband loved his tacos though..."}
{"text":"We were there for brunch on Saturday around 1 o'clock. There was plenty of room and the service was excellent. The food was outstanding and the cost was comparable. We did not have drinks because we had to return to work. We were a party of five and we tried their specials! The Omelette of the day with spinach, the steak Benedict and the salmon Benedict eggs. We also tried their BLT and they were all superb. Portions are big.I will be back for beer. The location on East liberty is great."}
{"text":"I mean, if you like a bar that plays Backstreet Boys, N'Sync, and Spice Girls, then yeah, this bar is right up your shitty alley!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, light menu but all items are killer good! Craft beer selection is tight and has an outdoor feel when they open front windows/doors!"}
{"text":"I was prepared not to love or maybe even like this place. Mostly, because I'm not college-age and the music is bit loud. I'm new to the area and  went because I live on the block.  But, damn! I had the most fantastic steak sandwich I can ever remember eating - and I am picky about my steak sandwiches.  It was thinly sliced Ribeye (still medium pink), topped with yummy melted beer cheese and pickled onion on really good bread.   I took home half the sandwich and it was even better the next day after 45 seconds in the microwave.  I think even the Tots are homemade.  I also want mention that I sat at the bar and the service was excellent.  Good recommendations on beer, friendly and prompt.  I will put this place on my regular rotation."}
{"text":"The Urban Tap in Southside is one of my favorites. I love everything about this place... from the welcoming and energetic staff, to the industrial interior design and great beer and cocktail selection. I love the gimlet, whiskey sour, and mules here.The bartenders will make the drinks just how you like them. If you're never unsure about what to drink they may lead you in the right direction based on your preferences. 

This restaurant is great to hang out with friends and socialize! The arrangement of tables allows you to enjoy conversation and feel the energetic environment around you. Choose a small booth or table and you can enjoy a more private engagement with a single guest. 

The food here is very delicious. My brunch favorite is the \"avo and eggs\"! I love how they bake the avocado just right and the side potatoes are filling and not greasy. Their menu caters to all sorts of appetites and diets too. I have heard the \"chicken on a biscuit\" is a great option if you're really hungry and enjoy savory  comfort food. The mimosa flights are super colorful and fun to share! Each one tastes unique with fresh fruit and tons of refreshing, bold flavor. 

I have tried the \"big fish on a little roll\" here for dinner as well. The serving is massive, so have a good appetite! This was definitely the best fish sandwich I have ever had. I would definitely consider ordering this again! 

Make sure to stop by at the Urban Tap the next time you visit Southside Pittsburgh, I don't think its possible to be disappointed here!"}
{"text":"A few friends and I ventured out for our first visit to the Urban Tap this past Wednesday. I was pleasantly surprised to be in time for Happy Hour (4.30 -6.30 pm). Before arriving I tried to find details about their happy hour online but failed - it's a definite must for any bar's website. The deal was the standard half off appetizers (excluding the chacuterie and cheese board) and $1 off drafts. Disappointingly there was no cocktail special. 

We order a range of appetizers - impressively they were all quite substantial in size! I chose the fried bacon parmesan sprouts and pulled pork sliders. Both were very tasty and came out in a timely fashion. A bowl of the Smoked Gouda Mac was ordered and did not disappoint.  Creamy deliciousness! The sliders were my favorite dish of the night.

The atmosphere and seating were great. There were a variety of seating options (e.g. high-top, bar, or standard tables) and also tables to suit both small and large groups, which is something that I've noticed lacking from many bars in Pittsburgh.  Our waitress was very helpful but it would have been nice if she knew a little more information about the beer selection since it is a Gastro Pub after all. 

One notable irritation was the complete lack of prices on the draft and cocktail list. I am not quite sure  about the reason behind this, especially as the waitress could only give the general prices ranges when questioned.

All in all I was very pleased with Urban Tap and it's definitely a great addition to the South Side bar scene. I'll definitely be coming back to try out the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"This is a pretty trendy but fairly standard gastropub. The drink selection is good and varied between craft beers, cidars and wine. The decor is industrial but not as far as steam punk (though the latter would be very cool). 

I've only had the apps here. They are very tasty but pretty common place. Overall a good place to go, but not a destination in and of itself."}
{"text":"Yesterday we came here for brunch. We were all running late but our friend got here before us and ordered a few pitchers of mimosas. Can't beat it for $15. This is a new restaurant that has popped up since my move from Pittsburgh in 2013. Our waiter was pretty personable and cool. His name was josh. He handled a table of 5 women great with our indecisiveness about the menu. I ordered the Brussel Sprouts. Josh said this is something that is very popular and what they are known for. I see why. It was very flavorful and I wasn't sharing it. I also opted for the bison burger with a side of sweet potato fries. Josh recommended to get the burger medium which I usually don't do. I trusted his judgement and got it. It was perfect flavor and not too dry as bison can be. I like the spiciness of the sauce because it added an extra kick. The service was excellent and josh was attentive. He engaged well with us. My friend mentioned she liked their lunch menu even better than their brunch. He also told me that they make many of their things in house."}
{"text":"Overall I was please. We ordered the Gouda Mac and cheese which was amazing. Definitely a must have started on the menu. For our meal we got the cod fish sandwich and the urban tap burger with pork belly on it. The fish sandwich was very large and the slaw that accompanied it was a delicious change of pace. The burger was good, but just average, the best part was the pork belly which was cooked perfectly. I'll have to try the pork belly sandwich next time. The fries that accompanied the sandwiches were very greasy and a little bit of a Burgatory rip off. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"A 100 beers on tap this place is a great addition to the neighborhood. Really good brunch spot too"}
{"text":"Cool ambience. Drinks were good. Service was SO awful. Very unorganized and hectic. It took over an hour for our food to come out and it was cold. Super loud which is fine for a club/bar but don't expect to be able to sit and have a convo while you eat. If you have a group that needs separate checks...good luck. I've worked in a restaurant for over 10 years and I'm patient when we go out on a busy Saturday or Friday night but they need to get it together or it will be another failed bar in the south side. Totally a waste of a Saturday night."}
{"text":"I tried this spot on a whim. It took me a while to decide what I wanted since everything looked really good. I ended up getting the bison burger and the brussel sprouts. The burger was delicious the Brussels sprouts weren't as seasoned as I would expect honestly it didn't seem like there was much of anything on them at all. They have a decent beer selection I went during happy hour they have half off drafts which is nice. The restaurant was dead when I got there so I sat at the bar and the bartender didn't seem very friendly at all he seemed annoyed in general. I'm giving it four stars since the food is pretty good and the beer selection was nice otherwise I'd probably give it three since the service was questionable."}
{"text":"This experience was a potentially bad one turned wonderful! We went for brunch on a Sunday so it was busy as expected but there was a mistake putting our order in so our food didn't come for 45 minutes. The server and the owner stopped at our table multiple times and apologized profusely which was very kind. They also gave us free homemade donuts (which were delicious) and offered us free drinks. They also comp'ed our entire meal which was unexpected. Overall the food was amazing and the service was so nice even after the first mishap"}
{"text":"I love going to the Urban Tap. I can basically call myself a regular. The menu is tasty and predictable. The wine is a bit overpriced, I have a hard time paying $10 for a glass of Woodbridge when the entire bottle is cheaper than that at the state store. I continue to come here though, for the good vibes and the pineapple tofu curry."}
{"text":"Was very excited to check this place out this weekend. I was with a group of 6 people (4 males and 2 females). The bar was not crowded at all, and as we attempted to enter the bar the bouncer allowed the female members of our group into the bar with no questions asked. When the males attempted to enter the bouncer informed us that \"he could only allow two more males in due to fire code\". 

I would understand his concern if the bar was at capacity or if the gender had not been mentioned, but last time i checked Pennsylvania fire code does not set gender limits.

Extremely disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on the way back from sunny Florida. Ordered the shrimp banh mi tacos and a cup of the tomato soup. 

The tomato soup was flavorful but oversalted. The consistency was a little more on the side of a whipped dip than a soup. It could have used a little more stock, cream or water to thin it out. 

The banh mi tacos were also oversalted (this seems to be an issue with a lot of restaurant dishes lately) and really didn't resemble the banh mi sandwiches that I know. They did have cilantro, carrots and jalapeño but it must have been the glaze on the shrimp that threw off the taste. 

The restaurant was warm and cozy with subtle lighting, bright windows and not-too-loud music. 

The services was attentive and pleasant and there were only a few other patrons in the restaurant which was a nice respite from a crowded plane. 

My husband ordered the catfish sandwich, herbed fries and the chili. The sandwich was nice-sized, the fries crisp and the chili not oversalted. He really enjoyed them. 

So, not a bad place but not outstanding."}
{"text":"Any place that can make a killer Bloody Mary in my book is the place to go! They make their own smoke infused tomato juice to boot. The layers of flavors are amazing. They really seem to know how to mix their drinks. The Urban Mule is an elevated Moscow Mule with a hint of mint and lychee fruit. Their food is also tasty. Try their salad and order the vinaigrette. I added grilled salmon on top and it was cooked perfectly. Light, most, and delicate. On a previous visit I had the Caprese Sandwich and the crispy bread was so good, I couldn't stop eating it even though I was stuffed. The menu is small but there's so many delicious choices. The servers are cool and very knowledgeable. It's one of my favorite places in the South Side. I'd go back again and again just for the drinks. I particularly like the window seat."}
{"text":"So its known for it's burgers and people come around late at night for a more upscale type sports bar. I highly recommend getting the brussel  sprouts as an appetizer. They're so seasoned and cooked to perfection. I've even been cooking brussel sprouts at home now *inspired* haha"}
{"text":"I only had a couple appetizers and a beer, but they definitely rocked it! Very nice atmosphere, only complaint was it took a while to get waited on. Just the appetizers we we ordered intrigued me enough to definitely come back for a dinner. Had the pulled pork nachos. DAMN. what a pile of nachos! And we had a side of the risotto, I forget which one, but it was great too. 

I look forward to going back... it is bit on the pricey side for what it is, but if they are consistently good, I am willing to pay a little extra!"}
{"text":"The Urban Tap provides one of the most comfortable atmospheres on Carson Street. Anybody can enjoy a drink or a bite here. The beer menu is balanced between macros and micros.

We stopped in during our crawl on Carson street for a pint of Great Lakes' Elliot Ness and the bacon gnocchi. The gnocchi's creaminess was complimented well by the crunchiness of the bacon and bread crumbs. 

I liked that the storefront was opened to allow a breeze to flow into the restaurant. Along with the breeze, the party from Carson street also followed in creating a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I intended to go to Streets on Carson but it was mysteriously closed. Urban Tap seemed a good alternative. The ambiance seems cool, it has good reviews, and it's a block away.  

We ordered wings (mustard BBQ sauce), shrimp tacos, and herb fries. The wings were cooked well but dry and relatively flavorless. The sauce was too thin and tasted like it was made hastily or, worse, came from a generic bottle. The tacos weren't good either. The shells seemed poorly made and had an odd aftertaste, my friend said. The fries were great. Nice balance of crunchiness, saltiness and flavor. I don't think I would go back. Most of the food was a miss, the cocktails were good and the service was great. But that's just not enough."}
{"text":"Very good ambience, and a perfect place to drink. But don't go here for food, it was below average. We ordered pasta with chicken and the chicken sandwich. Both had too much garlic."}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to the south side. I wish it was just a little less expensive, but with the quality of food they hand out I can't complain really. I've had the Gouda Mac and cheese and the pork belly burger. Both were amazing and flavorful! We must've gone during happy hour since our drinks were only $4. I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Arriving at 1:57pm, we were told that they would not be seating anyone until 2:30pm as their kitchen needed time to \"transition to the dinner menu.\" In an area where literally right next store is another restaurant, turning away business seems odd (especially only being open a short time). Additionally, we utilized the No Wait app prior to arriving which gave us an estimated time of 7-14 minutes for seating, to then find out it would be 30+ minutes. As a restaurant, I would feel like your customers shouldn't be effected by whatever is happening in the kitchen. We subsequently took our business to the restaurant next store, which had no problem seating us immediately. Disappointing first experience."}
{"text":"Ok. I really liked this place.
Casual yet items done excellently.
I tried 3 small seafood items and they were all done great. 
Reluctantly, I have to give them a 5.
Riley is a good host & attentive.
Go on Monday's to get half off \"small plates \".
If they are this attentive to small stuff- then they really got it going on.
I think adding a sweet-sour tamarind sauce to sriracha salmon is brilliant. Why didn't I think of that;)
Mussels were slightly gritty but that happens with fresh mussels - so I am good with that."}
{"text":"I'm torn here.  Their tap selections are solid and I had their burger at last year's Pittsburgher Competition and loved it.  This review is for their bar, not food, though.

I asked if the beer I wanted (8.2% ABV) came in a pint or chalice.  I was purely curious about that because I've seen different places have different benchmarks for a \"big beer.\"  Our bartender must have overheard me saying to my boyfriend that I always feel like I'm not getting my money's worth with a chalice because visually it's just smaller.  She started talking about how she purchased a beer at another restaurant and it was more expensive than what Urban Tap would have priced it at and how it was a rip-off (she was talking about the same restaurant I work for, actually).  This is a case of \"Don't run your mouth if you don't know who you're talking to.\"

She did offer samples of the beers I was torn between and she was assisting the couple next to us with suggestions.  So I'm trying to stay impartial in regards to her comments, though if you're reviewing the experience, that was part of the experience and it wasn't cool.

The other bartender seemed chill and like he had a good rapport with the customers.  The price here was on the high end of average for Pittsburgh: $6 for a beer (good Lord, when did $6 for beer become acceptable) so I don't know where she had room to act like they have the best prices around.  I'd love to come back and try the food - perhaps it'll be worth another star."}
{"text":"The food and the atmosphere is right, but it just seems a little too pricey for what you get. I like it, I really do... but in a city filled with so many food options and better prices, it's hard to justify making this your next destination unless you happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"We go to Urban Tap often and we're NEVER disappointed.  The food is always spot on and the drinks delish.  I have celiac disease so I need to take my gluten free diet very seriously and everyone I've spoken with has been equally serious and been able to make meals for me that I didn't feel like I was missing out on anything.  

We were just there on St Patrick's day, 9 of us including 5 kids!!!  It was excellent.  Courtney, our waitress had 3 orders of donut holes in for the kids before we could say Boo and drinks for the adults in hands too.  It was a fun day!   The kids were happy, the adults were happy, how could you go wrong!

This is a place we head to often with the kids, we always feel welcome and never out of place."}
{"text":"The place just opened and it's very impressive inside- beautiful bar & ambience! The food was delicious, I can't wait to try more menu items! The menu was diverse, but not too big.  We had the short rib entree, and the curried cauliflower (yum!).  They have a huge beer selection with 100 drafts- there's something for everyone.  I was impressed with the service being we were there within the first couple of days upon opening.  Our server was very friendly, attentive, and knowledgable. Also, they have valet parking, which for this block, is amazing!  We will definitely be back very soon!"}
{"text":"This is a solid option for Pittsburgh. Not the best/most inventive gastropub I've ever been to, but given the lack of other options around our hotel it wasn't disappointing. I will say that the Bison burger was great. Again, not the best I've ever had, but if you've never had one before I would definitely recommend it. It was juicy and I really liked the collection of toppings- I'm a more is more kind of girl when it comes to toppings! I ate the whole thing, against my better judgement. Oops... 

I would probably give Urban Tap a solid 3 stars for being a good spot with above average food and ok decor, but the service bumped it up another star. We came in on a Monday so it was pretty dead, but our server was fantastic. I forget her name, but tall and blonde. She let me sample a few wines to decide which one I wanted, was really personable, and recommended a green tea shot to us which sounded awful but in reality was totally delicious. She also gave us the low down on where to look for going out spots after dinner. Overall, I would definitely go back, and if you're staying around the Carson St area you should definitely stop by here!"}
{"text":"This just missed the mark. The urban tap came recommended from several other sources but I think the Yelp reviews hit it correctly. It's a very nice facility and the service was good. The food, however, was just okay. It wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. We had the goat cheese and beets. The beets were canned in the whole dish lacked any flavor. The pulled pork nachos we're okay but a little bit on the bland side. The braised short ribs were probably the best dish we had but the polenta was more like goop than polenta. I think the polenta would work well as wood glue. The roasted vegetables and the short ribs themselves we're pretty good though. On the positive side they have a nice selection of beer. I'm out!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for brunch before a penguins game. He had the chicken and waffles and I had the burger.. Both were very good. The service was great, and the drinks were good too. Not too many good brunch specials for drinks like other places have which would be my only complaint. Very clean.. Would definitely go again."}
{"text":"We got the pork nachos ($12.5) and a burger ($10.5)- nachos were fine. The ingredients were fresh but the cheese sauce tasted more like flour than cheese. The burger was fine (way overcooked) but not memorable.

I was impressed with their seasonal beer selection! It's rare I get to have an Avery seasonal. Yay! However, they need to mention when a beer isn't a 16 ounce pour. I totally get a 9 % ABV may be a smaller pour, but just give a girl a head's up.

All in all, probably won't be back with all the other delicious options on Carson."}
{"text":"Urban Tap is probably my favorite South Side restaurant/bar. It's always busy, but never wild and out of control and it somehow manages to keep the wild hooligans away on weekend nights. They have a great beer selection (constantly changing) as well as a full bar and menu. The service is always wonderful-- both attentive and friendly. I find the prices to be reasonable and the food is tasty. My absolute favorite dish are the Brussels sprouts with bacon. SO GOOD. The gouda mac n cheese is also great, but leaves little room for anything else. The only food item I'm not a fan of were the pork nachos. They were too spicy (menu doesn't mention spicy) with a skimpy meat portion with toppings on the top chips only. Subpar nachos don't detract from my opinion of the place, they are just not my favorite. Whenever I don't know where to go, Urban Tap is always a solid choice as I know I won't be disappointed and they have something for everyone."}
{"text":"I'm watching FIFA World Cup. Good crowd. Your trendy neighborhood hangout. Decent choice of tap beer. Ordered a Small Plate. Was really slow arriving. I could have had 3 beers waiting. It arrived, had one more draft. They are right, small plate, but very tasty."}
{"text":"Speaking from brunch experience: 

Came here twice, both for brunch, and loved it! Both times were on Saturday and seating wasn't a problem. The service is great, there's always someone at the front and our waiter came multiple times but perfectly timed for our questions & requests. She also split the donut holes and mimosa carafe that we had on all our checks! 

Brunch has a bit limited of a menu, but the chicken on a biscuit and Benedict were both HUGE portions and pretty good. Not sure if I want to try anything else, but would def get those again. Mimosa carafe was so worth it for 5 people, we had like at least 2 or 3 flutes each, roughly $3 a person! The donut holes were also delicious to share for the table, it came with a coffee chocolately cream yummm. 

Good for groups or smaller parties! Would come again and try the drinks on tap."}
{"text":"Dear Urban Tap,

I love you.

Hugs and kisses,
Alex"}
{"text":"This is a place that is relatively near me, and it is a place that I really want to like as it is often suggested by friends who want to \"try someplace new.\" The decor is solid, and the open front windows during the late spring, summer, and autumn are fantastic. Makes for a really good atmosphere to share a few drinks and people watch on Carson. I also really appreciate their attention to detail in their website/font/apparel design. Very trendy and inviting. 

But it is a place that can't seem to quite settle on presenting, or maybe I mean maintaining?, itself clearly. For example, the beer list - though it does have some nice options on an ever-changing list - is never clear. I know this is in part due to the many microbrews who often like to create cryptic, clever titles to their beers like \"Evil Genius Purple Monkey Dishwasher\" (and yes, this is an actual beer), but I at least like to be able to guess whether a beer is a pilsner, stout, IPA, lager, wheat, etc. through title or at least aid of a menu. When seated at the bar it is OK, as getting a sample from a bartender during a quiet moment always works nicely, but when at a table on a busy evening, it feels somewhat belabored to request a taste -- and the server's strained expression that is holding back an eye-roll, one that seems to say, \"what, you don't already KNOW what the Evil Genius Purple Monkey Dishwasher is\" doesn't quite help change that impression for me. Nor does simply asking about it or other possibilities and being told, \"I really don't know. I generally don't drink beer.\" Which is cool, I guess. But then again, I also like to have some idea what I might be ordering and for which I'll be paying. Still don't know what the Evil Genius Purple Monkey Dishwasher is, btw. Guess I'll Google it shortly.

The gatstro-pub sort of fare is the same. Though the descriptions are clearer than the beer menu and are often enticing, what will actually come out is a true unknown. Having had brunch and dinner there, they've nailed my burger each time. Darn good, in fact. Same with the fries. Same with the nachos. Really, really good.

But almost anything else, brunch food especially, has been woefully bad. In fact, it is the only restaurant where I have sent a meal back. Ever. 

I went shortly after the opened by myself, and I sat at the bar. I ordered the avocado and eggs. The unripened avocado was sort of like putting a knife through the outside of an orange peel, and the eggs that were meant to be runny and soft were nothing more than a hardboiled egg. I decided I'd change my order to a burger. Aside from not charging me for my original order, which was nice, they weren't overly keen to make amends otherwise. That was when it first opened a year ago or so, so I thought it was more of a product of just needing to iron out the kinks. Mistakes definitely happen, and having worked in a restaurant for many years during and after college, I can definitely empathize. I left thinking little of it.

Since then, I'd gone back a couple of times in the evening before a concert or just to kill time while waiting for others. It seemed better. 

Then, two Saturday's ago, I had a similar experience to my first. It was, again, during brunch. After well over an hour and after two pretty decent Bloody Mary's, it was quite busy during their rush, our meals arrived. I had ordered the Eggs Benedict two ways, neither of which worked well: the eggs were hardboiled, the hollondaise smears/sauces were dry, and the two types of bread were quite hard/crumbly. The other orders at my table seemed OK, though. Not to worry, I thought. When the waitress came back to check on us, I'd just show her the meal and ask for more sauce, a retire, a change, or whatever seemed fitting. 

So she did come back: \"So, how is everything folks,\" she asked. 
While casually moving my nearly uneaten plate closer to her, I responded, \"Not quite what I was hoping for.\" (Riveting dialogue, eh?) 

Anyway, she said nothing; not a word. She offered a somewhat shrugging, awkward smile, took my plate away, came back with some more water, and that was that. I don't expect or even want a freebie when I go out, but I do appreciate when a place will try to make it right or at least say, \"oh. I'm sorry. Let me see what I can do.\" I didn't complain to a manager or anything, nor did I say anything further to the waitress to this effect, who all-in-all seemed nice, but I do not think I'll be headed back again. 

I get why others would want to go here; I really do. However, if you do go go back, or if I do, I'd say really keep it simple with the order. Grab a burger. Grab a BLT. Enjoy an app or two. Have fun with a cryptic beer and some friends; go during a game, after a weekend kick-ball tournament, or whatever. People watch. Beyond that, I'd seek other options. Thankfully the Southside and neighboring neighborhoods can oblige."}
{"text":"I hosted a birthday party in their private room for about 35 people and it was absolutely wonderful! The staff were fantastic, so helpful with everything I asked and didn't even have to ask for! They were attentive to my guests and made the event great! The food was fantastic, I would highly recommend it as a venue for an event!!"}
{"text":"Food = 4 
Ambiance = 5
Service = 2

I had a really yummy pulled pork sandwich with deep fried picked on a pretzel bun that was absolutely delicious. The fries were undercooked and way too greasy from either peanut oil or vegetable oil. They're really thin fries so the greasiness actually made them hard to pick up. 

The decor was great. I liked that the staff wore smart casual as their uniforms. The tables were sturdy and the place was nicely lit. 

But I was really disappointed by the service. What's most disappointing is probably that my server didn't know that she was giving bad service. 

I met my friend there and we were able to catch up on three months of not seeing each other before the waitress greeted me. I probably wouldn't have noticed but it was freezing and I'm getting over a cold and I wanted a hot tea. I get it - I'm a server - hot teas are a pain to make. There are a lot of components to a hot tea compared to a beer, but she audibly sighed, so I apologized. 

After our food came to us, it was a good long time before she checked back. I had to wave her down for our check - interrupting her conversation with another staff member just so we wouldn't be late for our show. (We sat there for over an hour) She didn't offer boxes and our plates sat on the tables as we signed our check. 

Maybe I'm just sensitive to it because I've worked in a restaurant most of my adult life so take my modest opinion with a grain of salt, but the price doesn't match the experience. Great potential here and it's not being met."}
{"text":"This is a nice new place with great food and very friendly staff, and an excellent and changing selection of beers and ciders on tap.  The small plates are actually meal size portions.  My meat loving friends absolutely love the wings.  There are not many vegetarian options, but they are very tasty. The Samon poke is delicious.  If you go during happy hour, you can make a meal out of the small plates and get drinks for a great price. Weekend brunches are also great.  The atmosphere is relaxed and happy and friendly. Great place to hang out, grab a drink, watch sport, and get a good meal."}
{"text":"I decided to take a visit to the new Urban Tap location on Highland Avenue with a few friend for dinner recently. Having been to the other location which I felt was a decent experience, we were looking forward to seeing the new venue. Once we entered, we were impressed by the design of the restaurant and the overall environment. It was very welcoming, and very clean, which set a very positive vibe for us. The welcoming staff also were very welcoming, and seated us promptly since they were not that busy this particular evening. 

Once we got a chance to look at the menu, there were plenty of options to choose from, and I was impressed by the beer and drink selection. I decided to go with a simple appetizer of the smoked wings, while my friends chose to get the pulled pork sandwich and burger. Personally, I found the wings to be a little tough and under-seasoned, but overall wasn't a bad choice. The sauce (I chose the tangy/mustard BBQ) was alright. My friend who chose the pulled pork sandwich really enjoyed their meal, and from the size of the sandwich I would agree that it was a solid choice. I personally don't like sauerkraut on pulled pork sandwiches, but having tasted a small bite, I thought it was an interesting addition. 

While generally our visit could be described as average, unfortunately the positive aspects of our visit were met with some frustrations that left my group slightly dissatisfied. While we had enjoyed the wings and pork sandwich, our other friends burger came without toppings he had requested, and also was with the wrong cheese (which was also one dollar extra). While normally this would not be an issue, they returned the sandwich with a new bun and correct toppings but left it with the original patty. We felt it was a little unusual to return a plate with the same patty but replace everything else. Additionally, for a medium burger, the patty itself was overcooked and definitely overpriced considering the size and quality of the sandwich. Service was slow at times, which they explained was due to the kitchen, however, it was difficult to get the staffs attention for drink refills and questions given there weren't many other patrons there that evening. 

Overall, I had an ok time at Urban Tap. I would return if invited by a friend another time, but I would not rank my experience as anything more than alright, and would probably prefer other places with similar options."}
{"text":"Although the atmosphere is nice, this was overall a terrible experience. The server was inattentive and seemed annoyed when we asked questions about the menu. When we finally got our food it was mediocre at best- my friend's eggs were cold, and my \"omelet\" was more like a pile of greasy scrambled eggs. My other friend ordered the Benedict and it was on a bagel, which made it nearly impossible to eat. Not worth the stop. The picture is of the \"omelet\" I ordered, which had literally a whole, uncut sausage patty inside...."}
{"text":"Saturday was our first time to the Urban Tap.  Parking lot is about 12' from the front door.  Very convenient on Carson Street.  Cavernous \"industrial\" look once inside but 3-4 big screens for the TV addicted folk out there.  Long, beautiful bar.

Service at about 5 pm on this Saturday afternoon was fast, courteous, and helpful -- the crowd that was there was very young (to us that are challenged by age).  Waitress and kitchen were fast.

Craft beer selection excellent.  A few with ABV's that are probably NASA substitute for rocket fuel.  I had the Big Hop -- East End Brewing, and my pal tried the house chard -- a Toasted Head.  Well, we actually know about charts and this particular bottle was horrible.  But... we said so and they pulled out a different bottle which was nice.  But but... apparently they are going to carry only one label in chard -- this is a management error since so many people order chard that one does need a selection.  The waitress backed off on the price given this was an \"old\" bottle they don't carry anymore -- but very much better than the Toasted Head initially served.

Ordered two appetizers -- blackened brussel sprouts and a shrimp tempura.  Both were fine.  Service good but not excellent -- for excellent one needs to experience NOLA's group of wait and bar staff.  

Two comments:  I am rating this place as OK because it seems the management is too comfortable with the presentation to the public.  Waitresses braiding each other's hair at the hostess station, one chard total?, hallway to the restroom open to a back storage area full of clutter, and the men's restroom was trashed.   But there were plenty of bar staff standing around talking with each other....

So, a nice place to go at the 3 level.  They would benefit from doing live music in the front right corner and turning off the TV's ... really... has everyplace become a SPORTSBAR?  

f8 and be there."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch. Bartender was very, very sweet and accommodating. Beer selection is wonderful, but the food is sub par. Black bean soup was yummy but I got the mushroom tacos and I wasn't impressed. Atmosphere makes up for it though and I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We had a good time and good service.  The brussel sprouts were the best.  My Banh Mi shrimp tacos were just OK, shrimp was overcooked and didn't have a lot of flavor.  Everyone enjoyed there meal and they have a few beers on tap (150)."}
{"text":"The food was awesome.  The Gouda Mac and cheese is perfect.  The mussels were awesome and the bison burger.   Our waitress was not so good.   She was unapproachable and not friendly.  E. Hess was the server on the check.   Would avoid her."}
{"text":"Kyle C is the best server in the city. Exceptional service, friendly, knowledgable and willing to go above and beyond for his customers. Great food, great service. I love this place."}
{"text":"I went here got brunch and it was horrible. I couldn't order anything without dairy or it being deep fried."}
{"text":"Two friends and I were the only ones dining at The Urban Tap during lunch on Friday. We were seated right at the window in the front of the restaurant. It was chilly and they happily shut the window for us. We all shared the Korean BBQ fries appetizer. They were in love with it, but I thought it was just alright. I'm usually not a fan of sweet and savory mixed together, but I was still able to appreciate it. The appetizer was a bit expensive, but it came in a large portion.

Despite getting a fries appetizer, I still chose fries for the side of my Tap burger (yes, clearly I'm too crazy about fries). It, too, came in a very generous portion (YES!) and the burger was tasty. I had ordered egg with my burger, but they had forgotten about it. Once I told my server, he said he'd bring out an egg immediately. 

Will return (as long as the portion of fries remains the same)!

{"text":"I met a friend here for dinner while in town.  I got the salmon it was was very good, a touch more cooked than I had prefaced but happens to me all the time when I cook it at home so no biggie.  The vibe was cool and fresh and the service was very pleasant and patient.  Definitely a good spot!"}
{"text":"I've been to Urban Tap probably 5 times in the past several years. I typically go for drinks and/or dinner before seeing a show at Club Cafe. I've usually had burgers, but have tried tacos & Brussels sprouts as well. They have a lot of good craft beers on tap. The place is nice looking inside & the front tables are open to the street on summer. I had the double tap burger with tots last night. Burger was prepared to my liking, and had a lot of toppings. Bun was nice & soft. They also do a Bison burger, which I have not tried yet. I had Full Pint White Lightning. I sat at the bar, which was not overly crowded & service was efficient. I had tots instead of fries with my burger & they make these unique square tots that are fairly large & I couldn't even finish the last two. They also serve brunch here, but I have yet to try it since I don't live in the city."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I got the pork belly sliders, goat cheese fritters, and pulled pork nachos to share with friends and they were all delicious. They also have 100 beers on tap! Great service thank you!"}
{"text":"The Urban Tap is a great bar & grille. They emphasized the local brews and had a lot to choose from. I ate dinner here and was impressed---the food is much nicer than typical pub fare."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection. Had great waitstaff very attentive and thought it was raise my price. I love the sample platter of the beers. Have only tried a few appetizers like the pretzels and grilled brussels sprouts. Both are very good."}
{"text":"We came for a Saturday brunch and I was surprised at how quickly it filled up! They have creative brunch options and a huuuuge beer selection. The white wine sangria is really light and had a hint of cinnamon satisfied my fall spice needs. The Benedict came on a bagel which combined 2 of my favorite things, so I'm sold on this place as a whole. Although I didn't take advantage of it theres a build your own Bloody Mary bar that looked awesome and they have Mimosa carafes that I would have taken advantage of if there were more of us doing boozy brunch. Next time I'm in Pittsburgh I'll definitely stop by to try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh on a business trip and a friend had suggested going to dinner in Shadyside. I'm glad I took him up on his suggestion. Parking is limited. My colleagues and I ended up parking on a side street and walking a couple of blocks until we stumbled upon a restaurant that we good all agree upon.

It was a night of sampling food and drinks. We each had a flight of beer which consisted of 4 selections from over 140 options to choose from. Our waiter was very knowledgeable, making suggestions based on each of our personal preferences. Needless to say, I was very happy with my choices. 

Oh and the appetizers! We shared the duck confit chicken wings, general tso's cauliflower (my personal favorite), short rib poutine, and a burrata (cheese) platter. The cauliflower was crispy and had just the right amount of seasoning. It wasn't smothered in sauce. The poutine was a mound full of delight. The short rib was perfectly cooked and was amazing with the fries and the fried egg on top. I'd never had burrata cheese before. I was pleasantly surprised. It was similar to mozzarella it softer and creamy on the inside.

I know what you're thinking. That's s lot of food but the 3 of us made a valiant attempt to eat all of it. 

I would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"i've come here before for a few brews, but yesterday was the first time i ate here as well. i was impressed with the menu, and in fact decided on three dishes i couldn't live without.
first, let's talk beers. UT has a relatively expansive draft list. it's always changing, and their craft selection is usually pretty good. yesterday i sampled both the fatheads bumble berry and the dark horse blueberry. the waitress told me about them beforehand and gave me her recommendation, and she was right. the blueberry won me over. before leaving, i also had a river town patrick's poison which i had had before and loved.
my date and i split the tofu skewers. nothing particularly special, but pretty good. we got the chimichurri flavor, which i'd get again. then i ordered the duck confit poutine and the chèvre spinach salad. i assumed i wouldn't finish both but i had no idea how huge both would be. now, the salad i LOVED. i could eat it three times a week every week and be perfectly content. it came with mounds of gooey goat cheese, spinach, pancetta, a few shaved carrots, and beets and pecans which i did without. it was absolutely amazing, and rather filling. the poutine i wasn't quite as happy with. my first bite, i found a bone... i understand that happens sometimes, but it was a little off-putting. the duck itself was very good, as were the cheese curds. but the fries were already soggy when she brought them out due to the amount of gravy. i know gravy is pretty much the point of poutine, but damn, duck gravy is rich to begin with, this was almost soup with the amount of gravy covering those fries. i'd get it again, but only with gravy on the side.
our waitress was very nice, and knowledgable. when i had gone before, we had a bartender that wasn't quite as warm, so i give it up to the servers especially.
prices are very reasonable here. i mean, some of the food is kind of fancy and the beers are crafts, so of course it's going to cost a little more, but i think they're all completely fair.
i'll be back, for sure!"}
{"text":"Whoa! What a find Pittsburgh has on their hands! The sun dried ravioli was outstanding, the beer selection plentiful, the ambiance was ... well, it was perfect for a Steelers game (fun, friendly, vibrant).

This def. goes in the memory banks for future trips to Steel City. Really like the overall Saaaside vibe, too. Cheers!"}
{"text":"So let's chat.  There's a really great ambiance to his place and overall, they delivered on what they look like.  Gorgeous people served me good food and beer, and all is well with the world.

So let's get into the details of the service:

1.  Friendly greeting at the door,  but slowish attentiveness once seated.  A couple of bad taps later, and it was 20 minutes before I had a drink in hand.

2.  Chicken sandwich was excellent, very fresh.  More Siracha would have given this sandwich the kick it needed.

3.  Really healthy vibe in the room,  but quiet enough to hear friends around me.  They've got the atmosphere down.

4.  The torte wasn't a torte.  It's a cake, not remotely a torte.  Lots of whipped cream and unnecessary crap on the plate (cherry on top, really?) but the waitress was honest about the source of it (they import their dessert).  Not thrilling to experience.

Overall, I like the place.  It's a tap house, and meets what I expect from the name.  Let's tighten down some details and aim for five stars."}
{"text":"I've been to Urban Tap a couple of times and generally think it's a pretty good bar.  Haven't had the food, but the crowd, the beer selection, and the space all contribute to  making a visit a pretty good experience.

However, I will say that I won't be going back.  The place isn't so great that it's worth putting up with its miserable bartender.  One of the girl bartenders last night carded all of my friends (all 25+) which is no big deal, it's in the southside and I could see carding us, but she was waiting for us to get out our ID's and said, loud enough for everybody within 20 feet to hear it, \"your friends are really annoying me\".  

Really? That's how you act in the service industry, like a petulant child?  We were all (10 of us, so a couple of hundred dollars of revenue in 2 hours) very put off.

 There is not a single job where acting like that is okay. If she was my employee, she'd be gone."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon with a party of 11 for a bachelorette party. Hostess refused to seat us (we had not been drinking) and refused to give us an estimate on wait time. Terrible customer service and didn't apologize.  Not the best way to start the day with the bride. None of us will ever be back and we hope you don't go either. Negative stars would be more appropriate."}
{"text":"Stopped by while visiting some friends for the weekend. I loved the atmosphere inside; I'm a big fan of Edison bulbs and a more rustic aesthetic. We had Bloody Mary's and Mimosas which were both very good. I had a Ruben. The house made corned beef was pretty good, and the fries were seasoned nicely. 

Service, however, was pretty deplorable. We arrived just as brunch service was ending, and from the time we were seated, it felt as if our service wasn't wanted at all. Our server made maybe 3 stops to our party of 6, and by the end of our meals, all of our cups had been empty for at least 15 minutes. We racked up bills of $20+ a person, which I am perfectly fine with, given the quality of food and drink, but the service made it feel like an absolute rip off. Our server sat in the back while we waited for more water, and came back only when we were ready for our bills.

In short, this place has some potential to be a prime spot on Carson street, food and alcohol selection are impressive. However, poor service and steep prices are holding me back than giving this place higher than 3 stars"}
{"text":"I really liked the rustic interior and look of the place. Their beer selection is really great, with a decent number of seasonals included. I also love smaller menus because it normally tells you that they do those few things really well... Normally.
I ordered the wings in parmesan garlic. Firstly, the menu said that they were smoked and THEN fried, but when I ordered, the waitress asked if I wanted them smoked OR fried. I though \"Eh, oh well, fried food is the last thing I need,\" so I ordered them smoked to try something new and different. For $8.50 I got 6 whole wings (the drumstick and wing still attached), and 2 pieces each of carrot and celery. Unfortunately, the garlic parm sauce was completely flavorless somehow-- and the smoked wings just tasted more like... bitter & charred. The wings weren't terribly meaty and just ended up tasting fatty and like processed smoke flavoring rather than real barbeque-y smokiness.
My friend got the BBQ belly hamburger which looked really good. It came with fries that our waitress really talked up, saying they were so good because they're never frozen. They were seasoned well, but other than that, they were just a mushy, texture-less pile of potatoes that were also really REALLY greasy. None of that great crispy exterior and fluffy interior I look for in a french fry.
I also didn't like that the kitchen is in full, plain view from the dining room. I mean, it looked clean but...something about that doesn't sit right with me.
For 2 craft beers and a plate of wings, I plunked down $24 including tip. I've had better wings at Hooters. The service was good, our waitress was really nice and the food and beer came quickly, but the food was well below what I expected for the atmosphere and the price. There are other, better options for upscale bar food with a twist and a good beer selection close by."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 10 but arrived with 12. No problem!  They happily added a table to accommodate us. The waitress was friendly and on top of things. Brussels sprouts were amazing! Fantastic beer and whiskey list."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had an awesome experience tonight! We happened to come when bottles of wine were half price (Thursday night), and we had the pinot noir, delicious! We ordered 3 small plates (that were not so small) and they were the tofu, Brussel sprouts, and mac and cheese.  The sauces were the best part! All of the plates were super flavorful and worked well together. Between these 3 \"small\" plates and our bottle of wine, we were stuffed!  We felt that the price was appropriate ($50 for a dinner for two).  We also had exceptional service! Our server (Zach) not only helped us with suggestions, but was also appropriately attentive throughout the night.  Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We frequented the South Side location numerous times when we lived in that neighborhood and were happy to see another location in Shady Side open up now that we live in the east end. I prefer the physical space of this location, then in South Side. Just seems like there is more room and it's way less noisy. Came for brunch last week with parents and baby in tow. I had the shrimp & grits, which was so flavorful and rich. Husband got the merguez/pierogi hash, stepdad got the eggs benny, and mom had the tortilla espanola and everyone was a bit of jealous of everyone else's plate. Visually all the dishes were appealing and we'll definitely have to come back to sample more of the brunch menu. Also took advantage of the bloody mary garnish bar, but it was a bit picked over by the time we got there at 1pm on a Sunday, but that's on us. :) The manager is also super nice and very sweet to our baby, who was being a bit of a piss-pot. We ordered a simple scramble egg for her, which they were totally able to do, but she wasn't interested, just milk for her."}
{"text":"We've been here for brunch and dinner, each time the food was good. For brunch the Bloody Mary bar is quite interesting. Featured bacon, ham, olives, cucumbers, peppers, and GRILLED CHEESE SQUARES! For my meal I had the avocado and eggs, very tasty and filling, I couldn't finish all of the potato has and pico de gallo that came with it. My husband ordered the daily omelet that he devoured. The service was attentive, our waitress was prompt in bringing beer tasting and checking in on us. However, I think she thought we were tourists... asked us what we had planned that day and suggested checking out the incline... odd, but not a deterrent to come back for brunch again.

As for dinner we came on Valentine's day and had the special of prime rib for two, w/ a side of brussel sprouts--so flavorful and rich without being overwhelming. We had leftovers for the next day, very generous portions.

One negative I have about the Urban Tap is that it gets LOUD when there's a full house. The front seating area is kind of like a pit if  you don't have a taller table next to the front windows. I've not been seating in one of the back \"booths\" but I'm thinking its a quieter back there and would definitely recommend requesting a table towards the back if you're making reservations."}
{"text":"Brunch awesomeness- great service! Donut holes are an absolute must! And their pierogies & hash are a yinzer dream!!!"}
{"text":"We have been to Urban Tap 3 times over the years and it's time to write a review.  The first time we came here we got brunch.  This was like 3 years ago so it's been awhile but the brunch I had was excellent.  It was a three different way eggs benedict.  So good! So brunch is very good here and I recommend it.

     The second time that we came here we just stopped by for some drinks.  We weren't here long but it's always a nice place to watch a sporting event.  It's open, seems clean, and there are televisions everywhere.

     For our third visit we were here for like 3 hours.  So I got enough for a decent review of the place.  We came here to watch the Pens play a playoff game.  We got here on a Sunday afternoon a little before 3pm.  It was a little busy but we found a couple seats at the bar.  The bar is big and we enjoyed this bar.  The bartender greeted us and we found a lot of good drinks on tap.  They didn't have our favorite style of beer which is a New England Ipa but we found some good drinks.  We just missed the brunch special to get a Irish coffee but my wife ended up ordering one anyways because she was in the mood for it.  We were going to eat at another restaurant after so at urban Tap we were just interested in drinks and watching the game.  

     We had a good time watching the game here.  I think the service was good and the beer too.  My only complaint would be the projection screens that we were watching the game on.  They have two large ones at the bar.  It's nice because it's big but part of a light is blocking the beam and it's just not as clear as the other televisions they had around.  We still were able to see good but it would have been better with a LCD TV in my opinion.
Overall we really like this place to have brunch and have some drinks while watching a game.  You never know what your going to get in the Southside but you know what you will be getting at Urban Tap.  A Good Time!"}
{"text":"Went to Urban Tap Shadyside for a weeknight happy hour. I checked the website beforehand to find out when happy hour started (4:30-6:30) and what the deals were. The menu online must have been for their Southside location as the prices and deals didn't match. At the Southside location, happy hour is half off appetizers and $2 off most drinks. The Shadyside deal is half off drafts and $2 off appetizers and cocktails. Additionally, the appetizers were in some cases $2 more than their presumably equivalent Southside counterparts. The prices generally deterred me from trying anything on their menu. I hate to pick on the menu more but their expansive (~100 beer) drink menu didn't list any prices! That said everything I ordered was about what you'd expect to pay elsewhere and with the happy hour deal, drafts were a steal! I'll be to order more off their awesome draft menu, and maybe I'll see if those food menu prices are worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped in here before seeing a performance at the City Theatre. Luckily, the happy hour crowd had disbursed and there was room to breath as well as grab a bar stool and enjoy a beer and sandwich before the show began. 

The Urban Tap is a long narrow bar with the high ceilings and exposed pipes and air conditioning ducts that seem to be something restaurants don't mind you seeing. It works in the Urban Tap because the building is so old and you'd expect it. The light fixtures add a bold look to the classy but relaxed atmosphere. 

Fellow YELPER and friend, Kevin C joined me. He enjoyed a happy hour priced mixed drink and I had an IPA from the tap. Looking over the menu, not as diverse as one would think, settled on a chicken sandwich, grilled and loaded to the gills with creamy avocado and thinly sliced sandwich vegetables. Very nice presentation with a side of vegetables. Overall it wasn't bad, this place won't turn into a regular spot for me. Parking is side street or on Carson Street. Friendly and courteous staff, stop in before the curtain rises."}
{"text":"Our mini bar crawl started at the Urban Tap. This place is new to us, and appears new in general to the area. It is definitely a by-the-book designed gastropub - dark painted wood, tall and long bar, lots of TVs and kitschy touches. We sat near the windows and checked out the menu - standard gastropub fare - but were really here for the beer. Solid choices, and couple we'd not had, so blood orange and porters and Green Flash IPAs all around. The server was friendly, even when we demurred on ordering food in favor of drinks. A fun place to kill and hour or two over a glass."}
{"text":"Overall, this spot is a great place for good beer and good food. I always try a new drink when I go, and I'm always satisfied. The food is good, but I am a picky eater so many items are off-limits to me. If you like some odd (but tasty) combinations, this is the place for you. I didn't give it 5 starts because I have found that service is generally slow. Every time I go, it's usually a relatively long meal. However, the atmosphere makes up for it! I would recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection. I was impressed to see Wolaver's Coffee Porter on tap.

 I had the smoked gouda mac and cheese with chicken. It was heaven. Great place to watch a game, eat, and have a few beers."}
{"text":"Interesting brunch spot! Their menu and atmosphere is definitely hipster-esque, but I liked it. Their Bloody Mary bar is cool and has options like bacon, mini grilled cheese sandwiches, and veggies, which is a lot more than some other brunch Bloody Mary bars. I had the waffle slider for breakfast, and it was a good sized portion and a good value. It had a cool taste, but if you are really hungry, I would recommend getting a larger meal. The only recommendation I would have is to not get the egg over easy if you aren't into over easy eggs (which I'm not). Overall it was a good experience, and I would recommend for brunch!"}
{"text":"I am really surprised that The Urban Tap only has 3.5 stars right meow.  I went there twice while in Pittsburgh over the weekend and enjoyed my experience both times.  In addition to that, all of my local Pittsburgh friends were raving about how much they enjoy the place!

On Friday night, we stopped in for a drink before dinner.  It was very crowded when we got there, I can only assume they are always bumpin for happy hour!  

The Urban Tap has a huge selection of craft beer on tap, a handful of them are also from local breweries.  Two of my friends really enjoyed the Fat Heads Bumble Berry Honey Blueberry Ale, which included a handful of fresh blueberries floating atop!  I tried a few IPAs that were great as well.

We spent most of our weekend in Southside and wound up back at The Urban Tap on Saturday for a quick bite to eat before heading to the beer fest.  Our server was friendly and accommodating.  We shared the Smoked Gouda Mac as an appetizer.  It was deliciously creamy.  I had the Alaskan cod tacos, while my other friends had the pork tacos and chicken tacos.  They were all FABULOUS; and a much larger dish than we were expecting from the appetizer section of the menu.  This was enough to be a full meal!  The boys had the chicken sandwiches.  I didn't get to taste theirs but they both devoured them, so I would have to guess they were good too.

The pictures of brunch at The Urban Tap look really good, I kind of wish I had made it back there again on Sunday to give that a whirl too!"}
{"text":"Don't go here for brunch unless you plan to spend your entire afternoon there. Our food took hours to come out and when we did finally get our food it was cold and looked like it had been sitting out. It also took at least 45 mins to get a drink and we sat with empty glasses for an extremely long period of time until we were asked if we wanted another. When we finally order another drink another 30 minutes would go by until we finally got it. We would have been understanding for the kitchen being backed up if we didn't receive horrible service in every other aspect. Even if you wanted a water refill that alone would have been another 30 minutes of waiting. Maybe their service is better for dinner but I will definitely never go back for brunch here again."}
{"text":"Urban Tap is my go-to Happy Hour spot. Such a great atmosphere. Always has an amazing rotation of beers and food. Service has been impeccable. 

I've had almost everything on the menu at this point, and nothing is disappointing. Everything has a good twist on the classics but never disappointing."}
{"text":"Great food...had the pork on a plate, great beer selection...had the Dead Guy Ale and Oskar Blues...great service..highly recommend!"}
{"text":"What a great stop for happy hour! Their appetizers are half off, and craft beers and cocktails are $2 off during that time, so my friends and I stopped! We each had two great cocktails, but our favorite was the gin basil smash. It was refreshing and had great flavor! We split three appetizers: the roasted pork nachos, hot Asian bbq wings, and shredded pork tacos. The nachos were good, but nothing spectacular. I thought the pork was in too big of pieces to fit on a chip, but I enjoyed the addition of the cabbage slaw and the pico de gallo because they added nice tang and cut through the richness of the pork and cheese. The wings were awesome, and I don't usually enjoy wings! The sauce was sweet and spicy, and it paired really well with their homemade blue cheese dressing. The tacos were also really good! The pork was tender, the salsa was fresh, and the sauce on them was very good. I also liked that they used corn tortillas to add more flavor. I would definitely return back, and I'm sure you would not be disappointed if you stopped in! They have a great beer selection, good food, and an awesome atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Went here today for brunch and the food is really good and a good price! I would recommend going here. Very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"What a great place for happy hour! I stopped in here last Friday with a friend and we were seated right away. After browsing the huge beer menu, we both decided on sour beers. Mine was some sort of melon beer (I can't remember the name) and it was delicious. And our beers were only $3 each - it's too bad we came towards the end of happy hour, otherwise I definitely would have sampled a few more. 

We decided to split an appetizer and got the pulled pork nachos. They were HUGE! Easily a meal size portion. The toppings were plentiful and the sauces were really delicious as well, I only wish they had put more of the green sauce on top. My only gripe is that the appetizers and food overall are on the expensive side. They should definitely consider making their happy hour deal a little better foodwise. 

Other than that, I'll definitely be back for happy hour again!"}
{"text":"I've read in Pittsburgh Magazine the best places for brunch, but in my opinion there is no better place in Pittsburgh for brunch than Urban Tap.  I've gone 3 times and each time was better than the last.  Everything is very fresh and delicious and the creativity of the dishes is unparalleled.

We all shared some carafes of mimosa, but I want to focus this review on the food.

I got the eggs benedict-two ways.  One side was a layer of biscuit, homemade sausage and a poached egg and the other side was a layer of cornbread, ham and a poached egg all surrounded by a ring of hollandaise.

The side with the sausage was the best brunch plate I've ever eaten.  A perfect mix of everything you could want in one bite, not to mention the eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise was out of this world.  The only thing I'll say about the other side was that the ham was a little hard to cut into and the cornbread easily fell apart so it wasn't as good of a match (but still tasted delicious).

If you like brunch and you're in Pittsburgh, you have to go to Urban Tap.  Easily accessible in the Southside, but get there quick on Sundays because by 11:15 you'll have to wait."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say that our experience at Urban Tap Shadyside was the worst of the worst. Two weeks ago a group of five agreed to meet there to watch the Steelers. My husband arrived first and waited five minutes at the front desk but the Host refused to look at him or acknowledge him, so DH went over to a large table and asked the group at the other end if he could sit there and wait for his friends; they said yes.

I arrived next and shortly the other three arrived. The waiter came to the table to help the other group but walked away from us without speaking. My husband got up and asked the host if we could move to a booth that had just been vacated and the Host told him that he wasn't allowed to sit at the booth. When asked why, the Host told him in the most haughty manner that HE made the decisions of who sits where and that we would NOT be served in that bar because he didn't seat us when we came in!

IT'S A BAR for heavens sake! And this guy is acting like it's a five-star restaurant with reservations that need to be made months in advance. He was just a total jagoff. We picked up and went next door to Mad Mex and had a wonderful time running up a large drink and food tab. Never going back to Urban Tap. They hire complete a55hats."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant more like a 3.5 stars. We came here for brunch on a Sunday. The price was okay, so does the food though. I got chicken and waffles and sweet potato pancakes. Sweet potato pancakes is great, but chicken and waffles really aren't the best. It's grilled chicken and they put bell peppers on it, I'm not a fan to be honest. I always finish my food, but I didn't finish my chicken and waffles :( 
I saw some people have the fried chicken waffles, so maybe you have to ask for the fried one. My friend really likes her shrimps and grits though, so I would maybe come back and give it another shot. If I do, I will update the review for sure!"}
{"text":"Best brussel sprouts I've ever had, perfect texture and flavor. Worth it for that alone. 

Crispy tofu was really disappointing though, it's not crispy at all it was completely soft on the outside, was expecting some level of crunchiness. 

Beers are fairly priced."}
{"text":"Read some of the less than positive reviews and was somewhat worried about having dinner at the Tap.  Our experience was very positive.  We had the following appetizers:

Next Level Popcorn - ok
Mac n Cheese - good!
Fried Brussel Sprouts - loved them!! 
Pork Nachos - nice change on run of the mill nachos - good!

The beer selection was really good.  It had good blend of various seasonal beers.  I tasted a \"sex on the beach\" that was probably one of the best variations of the drink I ever tasted.  

Dinners were mixed at table...

Tap Burger - reviews were good
Turkey burger - really nice take on this - really good!!
Cod - tasted it - really decent sandwich
Brisket burger - tasted it as well and it was nice change on regular burger

Lastly, our server (I wished I remembered her name) was awesome!  Bonus of the place is even though on Carson St. there is parking lot right next door.

Haven't been here, worth a stop!!!"}
{"text":"So we haven't eaten here yet and plan on going back to try out the amazing food we saw being delivered to nearby tables. Stopped in for a couple of beers and not at all disappointed. They have 99 different pours on tap and the ones we tried were really good. They're not at all shy about offering samples of the brews available. In fact our server was like our very own beer concierge, He was knowledgeable on every beer we questioned. This latest Urban Tap location is fun and a great addition to the neighborhood of South Highland."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. Not only did I hate the fact that I couldn't have a beer here mid day (busy day is cause for a clear head!).., I did NOT want a salad. But it's diet time, so I did right and ordered the Chevre Spinach Salad.

It was excellent! Loved every single ingredient (warm chevre, spinach, candied pecans, shaved carrots, roasted beet, crisp pancetta and lemon vinegarette). Plus, with a $10.50 price tag, it didn't break the bank and it was a good size. I choose not to add chicken or salmon, but like that there's the option.

Service was quick and friendly! I really think if you're got a stellar salad, it can only go up from there! Excited to work my way through the tasty looking beer and food menu soon, once I can cheat:)"}

4. You want wait staff that could have cared less
5. You pay to eat at a place where the manager was of zero help because he was the expediter and had no clue what he was doing

{"text":"I have to say, I wasn't expecting anything more than regular bar food when I walked in here, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I was wrong. I'm talking top five burgers of my life wrong. I originally set out to order the short rib sandwich. Our sever let us know that this wasn't a sandwich so much as a pile of tender short rib on top of a juicy burger. I almost passed for caloric reasons, but decided to go for it. Good move apparently, because it was perfect all around -- perfectly cooked and perfectly tasty. Much to my dismay, upon a recent inspection of their menu, this burger no longer seems to be an option, but I'm not deterred. The quality of the burger alone paired with the \"toppings\" they still offer (I quote \"toppings\" because meat on a burger seems less like a topping and more like a gift from the heavens) including pulled pork and brisket still seem like they'll make for a burger fit for anyone's top five list.

Also, as an aside to one of the most delicious burgers I have ever had, the service was great, the bathrooms were clean, and they had an excellent draft beer list. Two of the beers we ordered during our meal ended up being recently kicked and rotated out. While we were bummed to not get our first choices it was great to know that they keep the beer moving, which means it's fresh. A win for everyone."}
{"text":"Great food and beer selection. Best beer selection in the South Side . Service was fast and friendly and for as crowded as it was the noise level was still low enough to have a conversation . Great open place!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Happy hour Monday- Friday, 4:30-6:30p, with $1 off drafts and daily food specials. We only stopped in for a quick drink but food looked interesting."}
{"text":"I came here for drinks with a friend on a Friday night. It was reasonably full, but we didn't have much trouble finding seats at the bar. 

The bartenders were fantastic! My phone had died on the trip over, and one of them managed to find a phone charger for me :) they were also very helpful in recommending beers to us, the list of 100 on tap was a little overwhelming, but the staff really took their time to explain different options to us and provide us with samples. It's so much fun to go to a place where the staff really seem to enjoy their job

We ended up getting a flight of stouts. They were exactly as described, with \"hints of chocolate\". I also had a wheat beer, purple haze I think, which was quite good.

The crowd is generally young, 20-30s.

4 stars because I haven't tried the food here, but I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for happy hour today (4:30-6:30) with a few friends and it was a reasonably good time. Our waitress took forever to take our orders and was pretty difficult to flag down most of the time. She was really nice and brought us what we ordered pretty quickly but she was AWOL a lot of the time so that was inconvenient.

Their happy hour special is 1/2 off drafts (they have a pretty big beer list) and $2 off cocktails and appetizers (which is better than nothing but not that great considering a cocktail is still like $7 and appetizers are $10+).

The ribeye sandwich was really delicious and I got a side of fries with it. It was similar to a Philly cheesesteak but it was really tasty.

Banh mi shrimp tacos were meh. I don't know what it was about them but they were just underwhelming and not very good. I don't know how else to describe them.

General Tso's cauliflower was delicious!! If every Chinese American restaurant served this, I would definitely get it over the standard chicken.

Salmon poke was just salmon on what seemed like fried wonton wrappers. The salmon was really fresh and really tasty, but the chips and everything else on top seemed kind of unnecessary and didn't add anything to the dish.

I didn't have the Reuben but she thought it was all right. Nothing special. It looked hella good in the photos though.

Overall, this place isn't really college student budget friendly since my sandwich + beer + cocktail put me back about $24 so I would not come here very often. But the food was okay and they have an extensive beer list and the restaurant itself has a nice environment, looks modern, and is clean."}
{"text":"I've passed this place a hundred times and thought, \"some day I'll stop in.\" Finally did and was not impressed in the least bit. They had a great draft selection and seemingly interesting menu. I ordered the grilled tofu and my friend ordered some cheese plate (mind you, these items are no longer on the menu). Both were awful. The tofu was tough, overcooked, leathery. I got three tiny pieces for $14 - overpriced for an appetizer. The cheese plate came out on a rock slate with cheese dollops carelessly dropped. If they were going for presentation, they didn't hit it. Taste, meh. I wanted to like the place, but my taste buds said no."}
{"text":"I have never been more disappointed in a Pittsburgh establishment. I was seated at my table during a Pittsburgh Penguins Stanley Cup Playoff Game.... all of the tables around us were watching the game.... because we are in Pittsburgh. A table of 2 asked to change the huge TV in front of us to the Cleveland Browns DRAFT... during a HUGE Pittsburgh playoff game. When I politely asked the waitress not to change the channel, she was extremely rude. Everyone else was watching the game and it was the middle of the 2nd period. The waitress told me she ONLY CARED ABOUT HER TABLE and that I was shit out of luck. Then, my waiter asked US to leave because WE didn't want to move tables. I have never been treated that way as a paying customer in my entire life and I will make sure to NEVER give Urban Tap business ever again.  GO PENS!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great beer list and competent service.  But the worst clientele possible.  If you want to meet someone from the Jersey Shore, go here."}
{"text":"I don't know what the managers of this place are doing! Please taste your food!! This place opened around Dec 2016 according to the waitress and so far its reviews have been negative. I don't judge till I try. Well, Yelp reviews didn't lie at all. 


You guys need to improve the food here. 2 stars were given for the cool atmosphere and the pleasant service but the food was just like a sustenance more than a dining experience.  

We ordered chicken wings as apps, fried chicken sandwich and chicken salad. They were all disappointing! Salad was bitter and lacked any taste. Grilled chicken for the salad tasted like oil and we left it behind. Fried chicken sandwich was the least worst but if you're eating fried meat, it better be worth the calories. It was not. The chicken wings with mustard BBQ sauce were just OK. 

You worked too hard on the restaurant design, facility and service. It's time to make a revolution in the kitchen, dudes."}
{"text":"Mom and I came here for brunch after getting our nails done. The spot used to house Buffalo Blues. It's nice to see how they redid the space. I loved the openness of it and the rustic decor. Buffalo Blues always seemed dark and crowded. The staff were very pleasant and welcoming. The food portions were large and very tasty which was nice. Unfortunately our experience this past Saturday was not what we anticipated. Our waitress was a bit ditzy. Mom made it very clear that she is a vegetarian and ordered the shrimp and grits meal and the full omelette (which is made with 5 eggs) filled with spinach, tomato, cheese, and mushrooms. I ordered the avocado meal. We had the donut holes to start which came with blackberry jam and apple cinnamon jam. The donut holes were excellent! A must get when you're there. Then this happened...our waitress brought us two orders of shrimp and grits which included sausage. Additionally she brought a half portion of the omelette (2 eggs) with kale, asparagus, cheese and tomato. When we questioned her on what she brought she seemed confused and tried to convince us that this was what we ordered. When we asked her about the sausage in the shrimp and grits, she claimed that she didn't know. We were pretty upset and made that known. Her response: \"so, will you be content with your meal?\" Um...no we are not content because this isn't what we ordered. Because we were pressed on time, mom settled for the half omelette ($6) and I ate the shrimp and grits. Mind you, everything was tasty. It just was NOT what we ordered. A manager stopped by to check in and we told him how we felt. Our meals were taken off the bill and he gave us free desserts which I thought was great. He handled that situation well, was kind and funny. Honestly, he saved this from being a 1-star review. Unsure if I will return..."}
{"text":"I arrived at Urban Tap in time to have a drink ahead of closing time, meeting a group of 4 girls that were already there.  The bartenders were kind enough to confirm that I had ample time to buy one round of drinks before leaving for the night.

What followed was behavior, by the owners no less, that was so abhorrent that I never intend to patronize this place again.  2-3 minutes after spending over $50 on a final round of drinks, someone yelled at me to \"Get the f*ck out of the bar.\"  I looked over at a table of 5 guys that were now purporting to be the owners of the bar.  They were literally yelling at me (for no apparent reason) to leave and they began to use words such as, but not limited to, \"Faggot\" and \"Asshole\" while one man with a beard began to comment on my clothes and hair.  They went as far as to be rude to the girls in my group as well -- again, for no apparent reason.  I'll point out that these men all seemed to be under the influence of a lot of alcohol and drugs, as well.

Rather than have things escalate, we took the high road and left.  On the way out, the staff was kind enough to confirm that these \"gentlemen\" actually did own the bar.

This will all feel worthwhile if even one person opts to not patronize this establishment as a result of this review.  The people that own this place should absolutely be ashamed of themselves."}
{"text":"The bartender Zack is the best.. They ran out of orange juice from brunch on Sunday and he squeezed me a fresh glass.. Give this man a raise"}
{"text":"Went to the Urban Tap for the first time on a Thursday night. Very friendly bartender gave us a draft menu with a decent number of selections.  Slightly overpriced, but I don't expect cheap craft beer in the South Side. 

I wasn't feeling that hungry so after boy ordered his lamb burger, I chose two appetizers, the curry mussels and the pork nachos. I figured that if I didn't like/couldn't finish one of them, either my companion could, or I could take home leftovers. 

I was not expecting the size of the nachos. Really delicious! Topped with pork, cheese sauce, and ripe tomatoes and chilies, this appetizer was a big win.  I also enjoyed the mussels.  Cooked perfectly in a panang curry sauce, it had the right combination of spice and flavor.  The mussels were served with a large hunk of fresh baked bread (which I barely touched).  For a hungry person, I'm sure it could have served as a means to sop up the leftover sauce. 

Overall, a good experience! I will avoid on the weekend evenings, however.  The Urban Tap seems to be a stop for drunk hipsters on Carson..."}
{"text":"The reason I only rated it 3 stars was because I only went for drinks. I'm sure the food is just like run of the mill pub style food but I'm not sure. The atmosphere is very welcoming and warm and the servers are polite and responsive. Over all very nice restaurant for a date or a business meeting."}
{"text":"Went in for brunch. Staff was friendly and good. Highly recommend the avocado & eggs, donut hole (raspberry jam - yum!), and the biscuits and gravy! The carafe of mimosas was almost entirely orange juice, (you could tell just from the color) and so sweet that I could not drink my share. Over all, very positive experience."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend and decided to grab dinner at The Urban Tap. The atmosphere and layout is like a lot of urban restaurants with an industrial feel. 

The drink menu has a staggering amount options and the food menu is very eclectic with a brunch offering on one side and dinner on the other. The Brussel sprouts are a specialty and did not disappoint with our crew. 

I went with the Tavern Wings and Steak and Greens salad. The wings are served whole and the buffalo sauce was very good. The salad was the highlight, though, as it contained steak, blue cheese crumbles, and even tots. It was del"}
{"text":"The food here was very mediocre. Now one caveat, we ate here the week it opened and haven't been back. Maybe it was just because they were opening. I had high expectations of this place because of the awesome atmosphere, but was very disappointed in the food.

The only plus sides of this place is that the beer selection is great and the atmosphere is really cool and different than any other place I've been to."}
{"text":"In a sea of bars and restaurant in Pittsburgh it's hard to stand out and I think Urban Tap has done that. They have an impressive draft list, a decent Whiskey list, and good foods to back it all up. 

The \"Bro Bros\" and I went here for a Beer to catch up and we had a pretty good time. I got the \"Chevre and Jam\" burger which was really good. I mean how can you go wrong with Jam and Goat cheese. The burger was very meat ballish. I don't know how they cooked the burger all the way through when it was practically a ball but they did. I'm not the biggest fan of ball like burgers but it was good so no complaints I guess. 

The only bone I have to pick with Urban Tap is with their Whiskey. Their more modestly price Whisky's were around 6-7 bucks. Above the section it said \"neat\" and then in Parenthesis it said \"( there is a $2 up charge for on the rocks)\" So I thought fine, Neat is 7 on the rocks is 9. Fair enough. 

Not so according to the waitress. All their Whiskey's apparently are served as shots. So the price you see is the shot price. There is an up charge for both the Neat and On the Rocks pours. After being told that \"she didn't write the menu\" she removed the 6 dollars of up charges that she had once added. I don't think it helped that we had been drinking or that we pointed out that they spelled \"Bulleit\" bourbon wrong on the menu. The Whisky has an \"i\" where the thing that is fired out of a gun does not.  

What fine dining and gastropub sells all their Whiskey as Shots. Who is ordering shots of fine Whiskey? I have a feeling there is a misunderstanding as to how the pours and charges are suppose to go, but you might want to ask before ordering some. Either that or they want the perception of affordable Whiskey by only displaying the shot price then up charging you when you order it any other way."}
{"text":"I went to this place for the first time the other day. They had great beer selection and excellent service. I was extremely pleased with the happy hour specials of half-price appetizers and loved my nachos! I loved the atmosphere of this place and would definitely go back. The only thing I would change is the music selection."}
{"text":"So many beers on tap, but hard to find anything exciting or hard to get. The goji caipirinha was not balanced, but the gin gin drink was good. Banh mi tacos-not much banh mi flavor, but decent. The duck and waffle- burned duck with bisquick tasting waffle. Cauliflower curry was a way over priced vegetarian dish with a floret of cauliflower, a half a potato and a leaf of kale- it was not even listed under appetizers. My partner was so disappointed with his meal and still hungry-he wanted to go to the kitchen and yell at someone. Not impressed. Not. Even. Satisfied."}
{"text":"Went Friday night for drinks. The tap list is extremely impressive, and the bartender offered taster glasses of a few beers that I asked about. Drinks are a bit pricey, but not outrageous. The service was solid overall, and the ambience of the space was very good. Definitely a good addition to the Shadyside area. I will need to go back to try out the food options, but I recall enjoying what they had at the South Side location."}
