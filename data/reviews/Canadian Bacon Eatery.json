{"text":"I wouldn't recommend this place. The food isn't very good. Went once and haven't been back. They have different kinds of bacon, which was their speciality but I tried a couple and neither was good. If you're looking for breakfast in the area best to go Niblick close by, or Stoneys or Kerr Cafe."}
{"text":"This place is the yum. I had the burger (with bacon, natch) and fries for lunch. The burger was freshly made, juicy, well seasoned, and cooked to a great doneness for a burger. The Applewood bacon was a delicious topper to this burger. And their fries are crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and properly seasoned. A very satisfying meal. 

Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm really heartbroken if this place is closed. After Smitty's closed, Canadian Bacon was one of the best places in Ontario to get a perfect breakfast skillet."}
