{"text":"These guys don't have a credit or debit machine. WOW, invest in 21st century technologies.  Of course i mentioned this to the owner and he just shrugged it off. The only reason I stayed to order is my mom-she loves this place. Therefore I was forced to go to Bilo purchase sone chips to get cash back."}
{"text":"It's 2016 and this place does not accept cards as a method of payment. Cash only -- so annoying. The quality of food is poor. So much so, when I had their fried rice it made my lips numb. Will only come here for egg drop soup."}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is so good best Chinese place in town. Chicken is good and egg rolls are amazing. You get your food probably in about 10 mins or less. It is CASH ONLY but I don't mind and it's pretty affordable."}
