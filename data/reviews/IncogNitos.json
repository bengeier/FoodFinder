{"text":"Food is delicious and actually fresh like they say. Good place to come if you want a chill atmosphere day or night. Staff was attentive and in a good mood. This is a cool place I can come in with friends and watch the football games too, so many TVs and a huge projector screen in the back by the pool table."}
{"text":"Good food, lots of large flat screen televisions, great beer in tap.  All the food is made from fresh ingredients.  I've tried the mahi mahi tacos, and their veggie hummus plate/ both very good."}
{"text":"I love this place. We were here for the soft opening. The owner Faye greeted us at our table. Our server was Megan and she was super sweet and friendly. I ordered the Magi tacos and my husband had the wings. The flavor was wonderful on the tacos and the wings were perfect and we are really fussy about our wings. I will come back for the grand opening. Oh I did think the prices were a little high, that is the only reason 4 stars in lieu of 5 stars our dishes; $9.50 each for lunch, Hamburgers are $11.00 each. But I am so glad this has opened . I will come back. The people next to us had a salad and burgers and they liked theirs. The chef just came out and said they are serving breakfast 3 items; biscuits and gravy and drench toast. Sounds wonderful."}
{"text":"Very poor service. We actually had been here once before and had a poor experience but decided to give it another chance. We were wrong to do that. The server who took our order couldn't seem get get her tablet that takes orders to work so she just decided that she will memorize our order. We even have her an out saying that if she maybe forgets anything that it's fine for her to come back and ask. Well she forgot but went on with it anyway. She ended up bringing, not one, but two wrong orders out. The food should have all come out at the same time but instead it was scattered through the night. We actually ended up not even receiving and order at all. The manager came out and asked if we wanted that last order in a box to go. Basically asking us to leave. That is when we knew for sure that the last order wasn't even ready at all. We complained and they offered to comp the check, excluding the couple of beers on the bill. It just seems like these people don't know what they are doing when it comes to running a restaurant. Not going back ever. Which kind of sucks considering that it is a nice sports viewing atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time in and it's a winner! VERY cold draft beer - love that! Lots of TVs and very clean. The food was fantastic - the Philly, which I am super picky about since I'm from NJ, was really good! Great roll, tender shaved ribeye and definitely something I will order again. The fries rock! Service was friendly and attentive. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible. My friend told me about this place so I thought I would give it a try and as you can see I don't review much. I always give people the benefit of doubt. However this will not be happening anymore. They took for ever to get to me and when they did the server was rude and could care less. I was very turned off and will not be referring this place to anyone. Save your money people."}
{"text":"Great new bar/ restaurant. Lots of TV's and open for all the games. Fresh wide variety of food, from burgers, sandwiches and steaks, to a wide variety of appetizers. Great place to bring your family and friends to hang out and have a good time."}
{"text":"Nice place and I like what they did with the remodel. Food is a huge upgrade from the old place as well and I highly recommend any of the burgers. Plus, they have the NFL Sunday ticket."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place. Yet, coming from someone who's been in the bar industry for more than 15 years, this place as it is isn't gonna last.  1. We walk in, nobody greets us. If the guy at QT can greet me with 15 people already in the building, so can you, especially when I'm going to be waiting for a while.  2. We sit down and wait. And wait. Finally, a sincere and bubbly young lady comes over, greets, apologizes, and hands us menus. I wish she had stayed our server, but she wasn't 19 so couldn't serve alcohol. We later made out that she was the owner's daughter because they were both gorgeous. Anyway, make the awful bartender run her drinks.  3. Owner stops by and introduces herself as \"the owner\" along with a gentleman across the room. Tacky. I wouldn't introduce myself as the owner, it doesn't sit nicely with most people. Show it, don't say it. She asks if bartender has stopped by, we don't want the bartender to get in trouble so we say we're still deciding.  4. Bartender finally shows up. Boyfriend asks for IPAs they have, shes clueless. I ask if the Huss they have on draft is the Koffee Kolsch, she says no it's ride pudding porter, I ask to sample it and I wasn't a fan, so I sit and contemplate on what I want. While we wait, I notice they do have the Kolsch in a can. Why would she not mention that when I asked?  5. We ask her how a few items on the menu are and she's clueless. Appetizers, \"they're good.\" Sandwiches, \"they're good.\" Sides, \"they're good.\" Again, your job is to SELL. I'm #1 in sales at my (VERY LARGE - 50k a day in sales) bar. Why? I'm not special, I'm just educated on what I'm selling and I sell it!  6. We're probably 10-15 minutes in and no cheese curds. Wah :( I did get my beer and a super cold glass though.  7. We get our sandwiches, a Cuban with truffle fries and a burger with sweet potatoes fries. Do we have cheese curds coming? She goes back, we see her discussing it in the back, my boyfriend follows her to tell her to forget about it - we're way past appetizer time at this point. She comes back with them, \"they had them, I just forgot them.\" Yeah? Thanks.  8. Sandwiches look absolutely amazing. Seriously, the food could be used for a photo shoot! KEEP THAT GUY!!!!! For the burger, I would make it a little more thin and wide versus 1.25-1.5 inches thick, as it makes it very hard to eat the burger piled that high (although, again, I know it looks amazing!). It was one of those sandwiches you couldn't set down because you know if you did, it would fall apart? You know what I'm talking about! Sweet ff were nothing special, and my bf's truffle fries weren't very flavorful at all. He said his sandwich was amazing also. Cheese curds were ok. Why are they on a bed of shredded lettuce? No, just no. It's gross to pick up a curd and find brown limp lettuce under it.  9. Oh, I forgot we had a server. She did come back and asked how our food was, as we're LITERALLY taking the last bites of our sandwiches. If I needed something, I needed it 12 minutes ago or so but thanks?   10. We start a pile of plates and glasses on the side of the table because apparently the server didn't think that was her job to pre-bus. 2 plates, 1 bowl, 3 glasses. The second owner (who also brought me my beer earlier) got them out of the way (thank you!). *If they're not using it, get it off the table!  11. A guy sitting at the bar top eats sh*t and takes quite a few minutes to get up. The wonderful bartender clearly way over served him.   12. 2 more friends join us, they get beers...I'm good with the original 1 I had, I'm driving. We'd ask her for beers and she simply wouldn't hear us. She'd come back with one...when 2 other ppl said, \"me too please.\" What??? It got worse and worse as the night progressed, one of our friends was convinced she was drinking lol.   13. We asked for the checks. And waited and WAITED. So long that they asked for another round&the checks again. Tabs come with more beers than anyone had because she decided that when the 3 people ordered a round, she'd put each round on a tab as the night went on. Why? We didn't ask for that. But then, people would get charged for that beer that someone else picked up the round for...what?? My friend waited for her change but the bartender came back with credit card slips&assumed she didn't need change-NEVER ASSUME THAT. Also, their sign which says \"BOGO\" is \"BOGO 50% off\" PICTURE POSTED in case you guys think I'm crazy! Look, $5 isn't gonna make or break me coming here again but it is going to make you look deceiving as ever.   14. Get rid of that God-awful bartender, she will be the first reason you guys don't last, believe me. Bartending and serving isn't for everyone. I remember firing someone for the first time and thinking, \"but they have a kid to feed.\" I will never forget what a friend said to me, \"But there's someone else out there who needs to feed their kid that is looking for a job right now, and they'd be a much better fit for you."}
{"text":"Our first night was on a Sunday night and needless to say not to many people on football night.  I figure this worked for us because we got to see the Raiders and Bronco game on the big screen and played pool. The music playing was a bit loud but the playlist was on point with a very good blend. We loved the burgers ( we built my own, Bacon - Avocado- Hatch Chile ) and  parmesan fries and onion rings. The margaritas were good but a little more friendly would have been amazing."}
{"text":"Hawaiian Tacos were possibly the best I have had!!!  Highly recommend- all their food looked good and puts other sports bars to shame!!!"}
{"text":"This place is so amazing and so delicious. The chicken wings are on point you can get them grilled or fried so if you're trying to be healthy while eating chicken wing you can be healthy. The portions are big especially the side fries. The Cuban sandwich  is delicious and the build your own Burger is superbomb I recommend coming here!!"}
{"text":"Clean and friendly place. Tons of TVs for watching the game.  Went for lunch, food was excellent, everything had a spin on the regular bar fare. Had the \"into\" burger with roasted poblano, delicious. Wings were crisp and huge.  Plenty of types of seating to fit your needs. Nice selection of sandwiches I want to try next time."}
{"text":"Had the Frenchman burger with parmesan fries (you can choose among many sides) and it was very juicy at medium & very good. Gourmet food presentation."}
{"text":"Still in the opening stages. Time and experience with the staff is needed. Food was outstanding already so match that with a good crew and its a great spot."}
{"text":"I was there for their \"soft opening.\" That being said, we had the normal expected training issues and delays. The food was great and we ended up trying some things they were experimenting with. From the looks of it, it looks promising and I hope it does fantastic! The owner was attentive and so was the server staff. I'm definitely going back if I'm in the area and in the mood for a sports bar type night!"}
{"text":"Walk In : 6:23PM Place is clean and all tables prepped. Greeting was briefly delayed, but genuine. Advised to seat ourselves anywhere.   Drink order taken quickly, waitress is attentive and not intrusive. First refill timely. Order taken quickly. Decor is sparse, but consistent. Decent amount of screens showing several different channels.   Restroom visit. Appears clean, but smells like a bar bathroom. Kind of expected, being that this is a bar. Although the burger choices are definitely upscale from normal bar fare.  The music was a little loud for dinner, and kept changing tracks before the song completed. I think the sound system is a bar type unit, where paid selections can disrupt attraction selections.  6:32 Food Delivered. Presented well. I had the Californian, wife had Chicken Tenders, daughter had wings. My Californian had a huge breaded chicken patty that was better quality than other places, but not something I will rush back to eat again. I feel that it was a good meal for the money. Sweet Fries were solid. Daughters wings were \"pretty good\", which is strong praise from her. Wife's Tenders also satisfied, acceptable, but not inspiring.   Waitress checked in as expected, cleared in a timely manner, and was pleasant throughout.   Probably not a place we will visit again, but we are not bar people. For someone  looking to enjoy decent food with drinks and such, Incognitos would be a solid choice."}
{"text":"Giving this a 2, only because the bartender/server was working his butt off. Had to service the entire place while what I assume is an owner, talked to a couple the entire time I was there, did nothing.   Everything was slow because the poor guy had to make all the drinks, take all the orders, and run all the food. He made a very tasty blood mary.  Food was underwhelming, burger cooked well done when I asked for medium. No reason to go back. I hate owners/managers that feel it is beneath them to actually work or that they don't have to earn your business. Good luck with that mentality."}
{"text":"So I can't comment about the inside of the restaurant in general because I ordered my food to go since I was just on my lunch break. I went in earlier to grab a menu from them since I work next door and placed an order on the phone before going to pick it up. They said my order would be ready in 10-15 minutes. I ordered chicken tenders with fries and bbq sauce for $7 which is honestly a very fair price!!! After 15 minutes I walked in and a waitress immediately came and helped me. She was very professional and kind. The food itself was amazing! Definitely better than your average chicken tenders and fries :) hopefully they keep that on the menu at that price because if so, this might be my go to place for lunch! :)  Update: they changed their chicken tenders price to over 8 bucks, almost 9 and now it's doesn't include fries... honestly not worth the price."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. I'm a local, and I remember when the location used to be Gallegher's, so I was worried it would be similar. Thankfully, I was wrong. We ordered the tacos, The Frenchman, and the wings, and it all was delicious. The house salad had fresh ingredients, and it came in a decent sized bowl. Plus, the beer selection was fabulous. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is the booth table had crumbs on it. Otherwise, excellent food and beer made me want to come back. If you like sports, there are plenty of TVs. I recommend you give it a shot."}
{"text":"We went in on a early Monday evening. We had a group of 6, very few other people in there at the time. Friendly, attentive service, she kept our drinks full! We tried burgers, awesome! my chicken tacos were delicious! The wings were nice and crispy, but a few were bigger than the others and were not fully cooked. The food did take a long time, but we passed the time playing pool. It was more expensive than anywhere else we ever go though, and for burgers and wings frys and tacos, 5 sodas and 1 long island, over $100 :-0 I can't afford to be a regular. The food was all very tasty though! And we had fun, a break from the usual!"}
{"text":"Start out with a 4, Since just opened.  Very clean place, duh,, Just opened...  Staff seemed a little new, so not sure if they had hospitality service prior, seemed a little shy to stop by once in awhile and ask questions.. Also, the manager/owner did a quick walk-by also.. NOTE ** New places when you open,, ask the customers what they liked and didn't like, as most wont return if there was something they didn't like.. Need to be very Social for this place to work. !!  Kids got Chicken strips, - Better than most places and probably the reason for 4 stars instead of 3... yes the breading was that much different in a good way !!  We got the steak sandwich and the philly, both of which were good , and equal to about 3 stars.. but those chickn strips,, yeah buddy..  Fries were pretty good above average, Onion rings average, and Tots, Sweet potatoe Tots,, lil cold in the middles.. (this is where asking us what we thought while we were there would have helped..)   Nice selection of drinks on tap !! Kilt ! TV's and TVs nice,, I heard you got them from the BEST place in town !! anyways,,  Will be back for Thursday night football, or MNF,, See if things improved !!"}
{"text":"I went on a Thursday night and had some time to kill. Thought I would stop by and see what it was all about. Ordered a Papago and some truffle garlic fries. The fries were bomb.com no complaints. Met the bar owner, super nice. Thought it was odd a bar owner who was sober. She told me and another woman next to me that she did not drink.  Anyways. A few moments later a man fell down dunk like a skunk. The woman he was trying to hit on told me later that he repeatedly asked for his tab and for them to call a cab and he was not helped. Finally when he passed out they \"called a cab\". However, for the next 15 mins he was still there. I left after that so I don't know what the out come was. Just not a good sign if they don't know when to cut people off."}
{"text":"First time in since the old place closed.  The bartender was very happy and up beat. He even did a couple Magic card tricks. The place has a bunch of TVs with sports on. But it's still quit enough to have a good dining experience, it seems. I sat at the bar. When I go to a new place I always order a burger, cause I figure that if they can't make a good burger then the place is not worth going to. Well...I'll tell you that the Nitos burger was badass.!.!!.!. It was so good!!!! Hatch chilies, bacon, veg, and a good size burger. The onion rings were good too. My beer stayed full as long as I wanted it too. That a plus for us bar goers. Not many people in at 2pm on a Wednesday but first impression for me was great.!."}
{"text":"Really was excited to try this place! And it was a complete total disappointment waste of time... tell you why.   Walked in and sat ourselves, no problem. Asked our server about several of the dishes and she didn't know anything about them except the chicken strips are good. Cool.   We ordered all our food and 15 minutes rolls by after she put in our order and finally let's us know they don't have a lot of the menu items. No shrimp scampi, no lobster bisque, no potato skins, no NY strip, no lobster mac and cheese, no meatball sub, no house chili, no spaghetti and meatballs. Pretty much everything we wanted to order... sadly.   Had to settle with the normal stuff. I ordered some wings, wife ordered a  burger with a salad and got our kid the chicken strips.   Wife specifically ordered cheddar cheese with her salad, waitress totally forgot. She didn't write anything down which shouldn't matter if she could remember everything. She was nice, but not efficient or attentive. Wife says the salad is decent, not bad at all, woot woot! Then the strips came out for the kid, not to shabby, overly breaded panko tasteless chicken but all in all it was fine and cooked perfectly, fries too. Then the waitress came out with the burger and proceeded to give it to me when it was the wife's and she ordered it with no tomato and it came with tomatoes. Looks like they tried on the burger and the meat was quality but there was absolutely no seasoning and it was tasteless. My wings were meh, small. They only had hot and mild which is fine but nothing special. No good beer at all on tap, or at least the waitress didn't really know what they had and only mentioned coors, bud, an ipa and Guinness. iced tea was pricey at a whopping 3 bucks which the waitress asked me every time my drink was empty if I wanted a refill... just fill it up!!! Of course I want more! It's empty and I'm still eating...  Anyway, enough of the rant but to sum it all up... they just didn't care, no love for the food, no love for the customers and no value. The place was super dead. I was really baffled by a new restaurant with a day before the grand opening that they didn't deliver good food, good service and menu items they didn't feel they needed to make that night.... this place won't last long imo. We will definitely not waste our time and money here ever again. Good luck incognitos... your going to need it"}
{"text":"Great place for football. Over a dozen TVs each with their own sound if you're watching multiple games. There's a large area away from the bar for family dining with the kids. The food is great, not your over-processed sports bar food. They use fresh ingredients and make all their own dressings and sauce. (The ranch and marinara are delicious!) They also have real Wisconsin cheese curds. Service is casual and friendly. This place is quickly becoming our new spot."}
{"text":"Bartenders are great. First night here the bartender did magic tricks for a little girl. Great food!!!! Loved everything I have tried. Calamari is awesome. Chicken tenders taste amazing. They have a patio which is awesome to grab a beer and hang out. Coming back more often."}
