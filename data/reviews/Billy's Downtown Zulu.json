{"text":"Unless your stopping in for a basket of chips and salsa (which cost $3.50 by the way) and a drink you can just drive right on by this place.  We stopped in for dinner and had the haddock dinner with salad and baked potato and the Billy's Fried fish basket.  The haddock was OK but the potato was small and had a large black spot and probably should have just been tossed and not even served.  The salad was small and the dressing was most likely straight out of a food service container.  The fish basket was served in a small appetizer basket and had a small serving of fries, 4 very small pieces of dry fish and a container of coleslaw.  The restaurant was quite chilly and the lights were extremely bright almost to the point of being annoying.  Also, there are large TVs everywhere which would be good for watching sports, but during dinner they were tuned to the news and were turned up loud. The only real bright spot was the waitress.  She was friendly and when asked about the food mentioned that Billy's is primarily known for Mexican, but more Americanized Mexican food.  She then proceeded to asked if we wanted chips and salsa.  We said yes, then were a bit surprised that they ended up on the bill.  However she remained attentive throughout the meal.  With the haddock dinner, the fish basket, two sodas, tip, and the aforementioned chips and salsa the bill was nearly $45.  Outrageous.  Billy's is just a confusing little place, with friendly service, and unbelievably terrible overpriced food.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"Small bar/restaurant off the side of 2 lane hwy. waitress was extra nice food was good. I had the nachos and wow was the plate loaded. Tip: share them or take home for late night snack. Get ready to pay $$ for any extras that u ask for. Kind of costly for just a quick dinner.  Warning : Could smell cigarettes as soon as I walked in the door. Place gets louder as the night goes on (drinkers) but reasonable. Can see the tv just about from every seat. I will go back to try other items but won't ask for anything extra items then what comes with the meal item just to save a little $$. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Service was good. Beer was cold. Food was terrible. The ground beef was bland lacked any kind of spice including salt and pepper. No matter what you order you get the bland ground beef. Portions were huge. I would not go back"}
