{"text":"Nice Italian cuisine to go.  My only issue is that if you go during off hours(anything other than lunch), you will be getting cold food. They do have microwaves to heat food, but on a number of occasions I've walked out with cold food, presuming that it was hot."}
{"text":"I eat there on a regular. The reason I do is because the food is fabulous and consistent!!! Pat who serves you is a \"JEWEL\" again consistently!!!! It is spotless and has good ambiance!!! I hope they never go away"}
{"text":"This place is one of the absolute reasons I don't worry about going to work without taking lunch with me! Every meal I had is made to satisfy ! I've been there for around 4 times now and had different items from the menu: stuffed peppers , pasta, lasagne , stuff zucchini! My favourite was the zucchini but everything is a must try!  They also have a corner that sells cupcakes and pastries along with hot beverages!   As for the service, it's simply amazing! And a shout out to Pat for the amazing way she welcomes customers! Such a friendly lady! I sometimes love to go in just to say hi!   The price can sometimes feel on the higher end for the portion"}
{"text":"Good Italian food. They offer the Classics: pasta meatballs etc. Get thee early to grab it as it comes out of the kitchen. Staff are friendly & the new owners seem to be doing a good job"}
{"text":"Moderately priced authentic great tasting Italian food with huge portions!  Honestly the meat lasagna is better than most high end restaurants. Try the ricotta one too for a nice lighter change. Love their soups..so healthy and great size.  Such a welcome change in owners. Love these folks and the great food!"}
{"text":"Nice little spot has a very good hot table Got take out but has small seating area Has a Huge cabbage roll and veal sandwich fresh bun Lots of pasta choices, chicken, panzeroties Small bakery section and espresso bar Lots of parking, it's in Richview plaza I'll go back"}
{"text":"On the plus, hot table convenience during lunch.  Plenty of classic Italian options.  Friendly and quick service.  Clean.  Seating.  Parking.  Moderately priced.     On the minus, no credit card - only debit or cash (not good for expensing for work).  The one down side of hot tables in general, is the food tends to lose heat unless really fresh.   Food:   Meatball sandwich: avg bun, meatball was a bit mushy and under seasoned to my liking, and although it was large which is the way I like it, it did taste on the room temperature side. Most likely due to hot table.  I was there during lunch hours.  Pepper and mushroom toppings were very good.  Sauce (gravy) was decent.    Chicken sandwich: avg bun (same as meatball), chicken was a bit dry and not enough sauce was placed in the bun to offset the dry bread and chicken.  Simple fix would be to ask for more gravy and toppings.    Rice Ball:  fantastic rice ball.    Ricotta and spinach lasagna: lacked freshness, not sure if it was cooked before lunch or that morning.  But tasted decent nonetheless.    Might go back and try other items."}
