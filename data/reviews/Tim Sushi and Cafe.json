{"text":"This little Japanese shop is quite the surprise. If you don't know it's there, or see it directly, you definitely won't know it even exists. With the options for some different noodles and rice, the Japanese style cafe is definitely worth trying.   Very small with only about 4-5 tables for 10 people, it would not really be able to serve a large group. Fortunately the food was quite good. A pleasant surprise was that they gave you sweetened ice tea for the table! Free ice tea? Hells yeah!  For food, the menu is on the smaller side, but able to accommodate different tastes. We got 2 udons: Unagi Eel Udon and Hokkaido Udon. Both were very different, but very delicious. There was about 5 pieces of eel and an egg, with amazing soup base. The Hokkaido was definitely the prize winner, with a great soup base and BBQ pork.   Nice quick meal, and definitely a delicious alternative from the usual options in the area. Only takes cash though, so make sure you bring some with you!"}
{"text":"Great place to have lunch. The people there are really nice but the one downside to this place is that it is so small. When it's busy food can take longer but at the end it is all worth it. They have delivery but if you house is too far they require a $10 fee."}
{"text":"This place is okay for ramen and sushi. I had to find a place close by that served food other than just sushi so we came here. It's a small cafe under a condo/office building and it only has about 5 small tables that suits two. It's pretty cozy. If you're craving for really good ramen or sushi, I don't recommend coming here, but I do recommend coming here for a quick and cheap bite with no waiting time. The staff are nice and they serve a nice sweet tea. The prices are cheap and the atmosphere is clean. They use a microwave here a lot, since I assume, because of its size, they probably don't have space for extra stoves etc. Had their house special roll and it wasn't bad, but considering it was torched, it wasn't really torched enough."}
{"text":"I have never left a restaurant hungry before but I could not bring myself to stomach the food from Tim Sushi and Cafe. The fish quality did not look or taste fresh. I did not want to risk getting food poisoning because I was hungry so I opted to leave the sushi and eat somewhere else.   I came here for lunch and there was no one in the cafe. That's fine, I've been to places where there are no customers and everything was still great. However, even with three people working, service was SLOW!!!! So slow that it makes me wonder what these three people are actually doing?!   It took us a whole 5 mins after placing our order to get miso soup and salad. Most sushi restaurants bring your miso soup and salad almost immediately after your order is made. Also, I will vouch for one of the Yelp Tips that the waiter who made my salad literally put it together with his bare hands after touching his face and hair--gross! The salad itself was just sad, only iceberg lettuce and dressing. If it was a salad that is out of this world, I could understand the 5 mins wait but it's too simple to take that long to put together. The miso soup was pretty bland and lacked a depth of flavour.   I ordered the 12 pieces of maki and 6 pieces of sushi for $9.99, which is a pretty good deal as most places would charge somewhere between $13.99 to 16.99 for it. When my order arrived, the spicy salmon roll was covered in spicy sauce. Somehow, my intuition told me that the avocados are probably rotten and as I checked the avocados under that thick sauce, they are rotten and black. The chef who made the roll asked to see the rotten avocado that I picked out, which was stupid and ridiculous--were you blind and didn't notice while making this roll that the avocados were rotten?! He took it back and made the roll with \"fresh\" avocado and while making it defended himself by saying that only the end pieces of the avocado got black and it's not that the avocado isn't fresh. If he had just apologized and owned up to his own mistake of not using a fresh ingredient, I may have given this location a 2 star but the fact that he tried to defend himself with an excuse that, quite frankly, does not even make sense was extremely off-putting. Let's be honest, an avocado browns in about an hour after you cut it up. So, the avocado has been sitting around for some time and has gone bad. DON'T SERVE THIS KIND OF CRAP TO PEOPLE!!  The fish on top of the sushi (raw fish over rice) was warm and the cutting of the fish still had some stringiness to it. I ate a piece of sushi, spat my second piece of sushi and decided that I did not want to eat the rest of the sushi as food poisoning is not fun.   The ONLY thing that tasted good was the California roll, I loved the fish roe in it as not many sushi places include that in the roll any more. And honestly, this California roll is why I rate this place 1 star because if it tasted awful, I probably would have said this place deserves 0 stars.  Lastly, why did the avocado in the California roll look fine while the one for the spicy salmon was rotten? Is it because the chef thought the spicy sauce could cover up the rotten avocado? SHAME ON YOU!  I will most definitely NEVER return to this place. In fact, I will not be recommending this place to anyone either. STAY AWAY FROM HERE!"}
{"text":"They're Chinese owned which explains the lack of authenticity. But they missed the mark completely. I'm not saying this after eating omakase at an expensive restaurant but I'm saying this after not having sushi for a month and ANY sushi should make me happy.  They take Chinese rice, slightly over cook it, don't add any rice wine vinegar and call that sushi rice. If you've watched any sushi documentary, the rice is the main ingredient. Also all the fish had a slight freezer burnt taste to it. I originally was going to comment on how I like they left the fish room temperature but I think they just microwaved it.  My lunch date had the Japanese curry pork cutlet which was okay but kind of bland. The pork was nice and crispy though.  Also, they serve ice tea instead of traditional green tea. It's sweet ice tea but I'd prefer hot tea with oriental meals. Or maybe I'm just bitter about the roll of rice they call sushi/maki.  If you can't do something right don't do it at all. Take sushi off your menu please."}
{"text":"Good for snack.  Good for lunch.  Good pricing.  Good value on food.  Good sweet tea which is free if u eat in.  Just pretty good overall."}
{"text":"I needed lunch delivered to my at this office I work at, so naturally I went on Yelp and started scouring and I came upon Tim Sushi and Cafe. I decided to take a chance and picked up the phone to call and place my order.  Whomever I spoke with on the phone (I believe it was the owner, Tim) was a bit hard to understand but he was very nice and polite. I work in an office and the address/unit thing is a bit confusing and I called him back after placing my order to give him the company name so he wouldn't get lost. He patiently waited for me to finish and told me not to worry and that my food would be there in 10 - 15 mins.   The food is AMAZING. I ordered the Hokkaido Butter Udon and the 6pcs Sushi + 12pcs Maki combo. Everything was delicious and very filling. I was very satisfied with the customer service and the food quality. Would definitely recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"This place in a nutshell: Average Japanese food, cheap prices, no advertisements, limited seating. Also it's name in front is ??? Caf√© (Don Don Ya) since the name is Chinese only and.... not on the Yelp. The receipt comes out as 'Tim Sushi' though.  Let's be clear here, the prices are really good for the dishes you order. I've seen this restaurant in this plaza for a while and I've never been sure how they survive with cheap prices. Maybe they just get the overflow customers when Gal's Sushi around the corner is full or there are a lot more office workers here during lunch / dinner than I'd think.  We thought everything we had was about average. My meal at $9.99 for 6 sushi + 12 maki, miso soup and green salad was okay. The fish was decent and the presentation was good. My 12 maki was a california roll and a tuna roll with way too much spicy mayo on it. But hey, it was only $9.99 right? The iced tea that they leave on the table is pretty good, though I found it odd that they don't pour it out for you at all.  For some reason, they didn't play music, or a TV while we were there. So it was pretty dead silent in the restaurant.  Wifi password is 6479670000. 10% off takeout orders. Cash only. The staff speak Cantonese and Mandarin."}
{"text":"It's pretty hard to find the restaurant, the sign is not in English. It's also a very small place with 5 tables and a small bar.  We ordered the 6 sushi + 12 maki for $9.99 and the dragon roll for $9.99. Nothing spectacular but very good in value."}
{"text":"Not a lot of people know about this place because it's so small, but it's really a hidden gem!  I always come here for lunch but I usually get takeout because once again this place is tiny.  They serve pretty good food but I only ever get their bento or ramen so I'm not sure about their sushi :$  The bentos are a super good price for only $7 (comes with soup and salad as well)! My favourite is the Japanese fish bento because it's just amazing! YOU MUST TRY IT. They make their own secret sauce for the fish bento and burger and it's basically heaven on earth.  I've tried their ramen and curry before too and they were all delicious! Soup base for ramen was a little too salty though so I prefer their curry udon more.   The location is very convinient for me and they also do delivery, but only for close distances. Otherwise, I think they charge you $10 (?)  If you do decide to dine-in, you get free unlimited iced tea! Service is decent, but don't expect too much. The owner, Tim, is really friendly too so it's nice chatting with him sometimes (even though he doesn't remember me lol).  Overall, you get really delicious food for a super good price! You also get a discount if you order takeout and pay in cash, so make sure you give this place a try! REMEMBER, YOU MUST TRY THE FISH BENTO. YOU MUST."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered a beef and egg donburi, a plate of salmon sashimi and 18 pieces of sushi. The beef and egg donburi was extremely bland and plain - they pretty much made a beef egg omelette and put it on top of rice. You could tell the sashimi was not fresh at all - it had a strong freezer burnt taste to it. Finally, the 18 pieces of sushi came with 6 pieces of sushi + 12 pieces of maki rolls (I picked the salmon maki and the spicy tuna maki). I would say the quality of the sushi were equivalent to the ones you get at supermarkets like T&T. The spicy tuna roll had tuna and avocado in it topped off with too much spicy mayo.   Lastly, the restaurant is extremely small and only sits 12 people. The table that sat by the entrance was having a very loud conversation with one of the staff members who was at the back of the restaurant. They were literally talking over us back and forth for the whole time we were there.   Overall, we did not have a pleasant experience."}
