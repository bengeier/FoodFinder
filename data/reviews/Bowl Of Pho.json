{"text":"Sooo Goood. This is my first time at a Vietnamese restaurant. I had the charbroiled beef,egg roll,vegetable, noodle bowl. The flavors were very good and the portions very generous. There were six people in our party two were already returning customers.
Everyone enjoyed there food and especially liked  the spring rolls
 with there orders. The service was very efficient  and pleasant, the decor sharp. I am looking forward to trying other menu items and recommend it highly."}
{"text":"Food came out fast. Portions rather small. Food didn't have as much flavor as we expected.  Place is small, intimate and packed on Friday night."}
{"text":"This is my very first ever review.  I felt obliged to give my review because my experience and taste of the pho I had was absolutely a joke!

FYI,  I had the Pho Dac Biet - Deluxe Beef Noodle Soup (combination of meat balls, steak, tendon).  The broth basically tasted like water and had the consistency of water - no flavor. Usually the broth would be prepped overnight to get the juices & oils from the beef, spices, star anise, etc. For $9.95, I felt the portion of the bowl should have been larger, including the meat and noodles.  

Also, I had ordered a Taro Bubble boba. The tapioca balls were the worst, they had the consistency of bb-gun pellets.

IF YOU'VE NEVER HAD PHO, 'BOWL OF PHO' IS NOT THE REPRESENTATION. I was so excited too for some asian food too! =( Disappointment indeed."}
{"text":"Went here on a lunch date for my first ever pho (and I'm from the DC area--really should have had some before!). My partner ordered the beef deluxe pho, and I ordered the vegetarian pho, plus a taro boba. Everything was delicious. The wait staff was very nice and helpful with us pho first-timers. Even though the food was a little expensive, the restaurant is very clean and nicely-decorated inside, and the food was totally worth it. Big bowl, fresh vegetables, and delicious broth. I liked how they shared the toppings between the two of us, which I assume they do for all lunch-for-twos. The tofu consistency was perfect. The only thing we didn't like was the tripe in my partner's pho bowl--but that is totally their fault for not reading the ingredients!

I've since had vegetarian pho in Fairfax, VA and it was a disappointment compared to Bowl of Pho. 

I took my leftovers home, and ate them during the trip home--just as delicious then as they first were. Hope to come here again when I'm back in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken pho and really enjoyed it! The restaurant seemed pretty empty and is defintitely under appreciated!"}
{"text":"Fresh, quality ingredients, great service. The meat crepe was something I had never seen on a menu before but was very tasty! Vermicelli bowl was good, but I wasn't blown away. Definitely get the taro bubble tea- you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Bad service, ok pho. Didn't worth the drive.

Interior was too fancy, so was dish. I'd give B for Food, C for place, D for service. The waiter was plain rude."}
{"text":"Pho broth was very weak and bland. Very stingy with hoisin sauce and seracha sauce they kept serving it in a tiny sauce plate.  But not bad for being the only Vietnamese restaurant  in the area.  Price is reasonable. Atmosphere is good.  Clean place. Staff was very nice. Service was good overall."}
{"text":"Great food and great staff. Order the com tam or the pho."}
{"text":"6 of us had lunch here today. I wish it had been a better experience. The place was very busy, usually a good sign, and we waited 20 minutes for a table. This was not an issue but after sitting down we waited almost as long for water.
We ordered a variety of dishes and after another long wait everyone at the table received their plates....of green peppers. Seriously, green peppers! The seasoned stir fried vegetables which were described as \" fresh green beans, sliced carrots, straw mushrooms, onions and baby corn\", was presented as a pile of greasy peppers. Not even the onions were included.  The shrimp salad at least had a few shrimp in with the peppers but they were tasteless. The tofu sate was a large plate of stir fried peppers over a few noodles topped with 5 bites of tofu. Peppers were not listed as an item in any of these dishes. 
After realizing that all ours meals consisted mainly of peppers we asked specifically about the stir fry dish, since this was the worst, only peppers! The waitress went away and after too long a time came back to tell us this was what they had today. She said she was sorry about it and went left. 5 minutes later she came back and said if we wanted to order something else she would exchange our dishes. 
We declined as it seemed pointless, every dish was filled with peppers and we were tired of being here by this time. Never did the hostess, cook or anyone else come by to apologise.
The pho that we had was bland, we had to ask for the sauces that usually accompany the dish, and of course it came with peppers as a main ingredient. The only decent dish was the papaya salad which amazingly was spared the addition of green peppers.
At the end of the meal one plate of the stir fry remained mostly untouched and the other plates left with varying amounts of the peppers.  The waitress brought our bill which totaled $72.00 for basically a lot of peppers. There was no adjustment made for the fact that we didn't get dishes that even vaguely resembled the menu description.
We shall not return and I caution diners, unless you love green peppers to the exclusion of all other vegetables, find somewhere else to eat!"}
{"text":"Clean, refreshing, and a welcoming atmosphere. Their pho is really really good! I would have to say, best tasting pho in the northeast Ohio region that I have visited. Will definitely return for their pho...can't say the same for the rest of staff members. I don't think it will really hurt if they would smile a little more."}
{"text":"fresh, tasty food! I've had the chicken fried rice (very good) and pork spring rolls (awesome!) i would def recommend both dishes, but the spring rolls are a must try! really cute interior as well.. i've dined in once and taken out once, both good experiences."}
{"text":"Very good! Delightfully surprised and happy that there is a veggie pho option."}
{"text":"So glad to have a Vietnamese resto in the eastern suburbs. Is it ultra authentic? Who cares? I loved my vermicelli bun with crispy, non-greasy spring rolls. It does get very busy at lunch time, with tables full of chattering Pepper Pike housewives and gangs of dockers clad Office dweebs. (note if dining alone: sit at bar and bring a tablet -- they have wi-fi)."}
{"text":"We started with the trio skewers: shrimp, chicken and beef with varied sauces for dipping. Beautifully presented and delicious. Then I had the shrimp noodle bowl and my wife the chicken noodle bowl. Both with rice noodles. Large portions but some might want to see a bit more meat on these. A third bowl with tofu we brought home; I would have liked to see more of the yummy fried tofu in this entree too. The small amount of meat/tofu provided was not a problem for us since we started with the skewers. For the \"gluten sensitive\" no problem here. Attentive prompt service. Very reasonably priced. We will be back soon and they have carry out!!"}
{"text":"Really great food and pretty great service as well. Sometimes it's way too busy around lunchtime and have had to cancel plans before but the staff was friendly and tried to be as accommodating as possible."}
{"text":"WOW what a nice place to go for something simple. I had the pork chop and came back for the beef and noodle dish with shrimp and it was fantastic. Spring roll was just right. Little bits of spicy cilantro tease you between the noodles and the lime. I will be back."}
{"text":"Nice small restaurant. We only saw meat pho options. The broth was flavorful and serving size was average. Kids enjoyed the chicken skewer appetizer and mango bubble tea. Overall, it's decently priced and we will go back for a casual family dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped for a bubble tea to go. Realized after I paid and get outside that there are no tapioca pearls. Go back in and they tell me they are out of them. Wouldn't that be something you should tell the paying customer. Not a good impression of good business. The pearls make the drink! And the Taro had a weird after taste. No fun at Pho!"}
{"text":"Just okay...

I've eaten a lot of good Pho around the Arlington, VA area and I have to say this one is just OK: it's good soup -- but just OK for pho.

The place is nice, clean, new, but the following are the few things that I noticed that don't meet the \"pho\" standard I've seen other places for the following reasons: the lime slices were small, the sriracha sauce comes in a porcelain cup mixed with the hoisin sauce, and hardly any comes it it (I had to ask for more, typical pho places have bottles on the table), there were no (disposable) napkins readily available on the table for the (inevitable and typical) hot and spicy soup nose.

As for the soup itself, the noodles were a but harder than typical pho noodles, the chicken in my pho ga was pulled chicken (all pho I've seen is larger thin slices of chicken), and finally the broth seemed over-oniony, a flavor I've never really tasted in pho. 

I also had the opportunity to try the Taro Bubble Tea, and while the flavor was good, the boba was hard, typical of boba that isn't quite fresh.

Either way, like I said, it's a good soup, but if you're looking for an authentic presentation and flavor of pho, you might want to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"went there for lunch today. I had the beef pho which was very good.My wife had the pork chop which was little dry and they don't give you broken rice!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and good food.  This Vietnamese restaurant is a welcome addition to the east side."}
{"text":"This place has beautiful, peaceful ambiance and should be delicious. Unfortunately, the food is mediocre at best. It is well-presented and the ingredients are fresh but the flavors are bland and overly sweet (even tho viet food typically sweet). The noodles in the pho were in a big clump and took quite a bit of work to separate and disperse into the soup. My pork bun was luke warm and very bland. Overall a huge disappointment. We won't be back and wouldn't recommend this place. Very sad because this place has huge potential."}
{"text":"I am a connoisseur of Pho Ga (chicken noodle soup).  I do not pretend to eat anything else when I'm eating Vietnamese food and thus my myopic review will shed light on only the pho.

I had the huge bowl of soup and it was as good as I've ever been served.

$8.95 + .72tax =$9.67   It's more than I'm used to paying for pho by a few $ but it was worth it.

If you like the pho den you know the place ta go.  Get some!"}
{"text":"This place if wonderful! The food is amazing and always fresh and so very good! Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Yeah! Veggie friendly pho! Love. It was really good. The rolls (both fried and fresh) were good but the sauce was better. Glad to find pho by home. Very clean. I will be back."}
{"text":"If you're talking pho you're speaking my language. VIETNAMESE MEDICINE . Something secret in the broth that is so so magical . Extremely fresh and they have a full bar"}
{"text":"This place is small (it has 3 booths and perhaps 10 two person tables), clean, and modern. I always get the same two dishes, and they're consistently delectable. 

The Pho Tái is pretty good (not as good as Superior Pho, but good nonetheless), very aromatic, and always accompanied by a big plate of pho fixings. The Bún Tôm Nuong, however, has become my new favorite ever since a friend ordered it. Perfectly cooked & seasoned shrimp, fresh vegetables, and flavorful sauce. Could use more cilantro than a single sprig, though.

Service can be a little slow or spotty at times, but not bad by any means."}
{"text":"I've passed this place frequently on my east side excursions, as it's right around the corner from Whole Foods and Corky and Lenny's, but today I had the time and inclination for a light lunch to give it a try. I went with my typical pho place order, the crispy spring rolls and pho tai.  Both were quite fine. The spring rolls were crispy and a little flaky and quite fresh and done well (i.e. not \"well done\"). The pho was lovely and came with the freshest and additions I've seen.  That was the best, biggest, and plum pest Thai basil I've ever seen, and the lime was so juicy.  I seemed to have trouble with the metal chop sticks, for some reason, maybe I am just so used to the plastic ones at Siam Cafe. It was a lunch crowd that was mostly female and tracked a little older. There was a lot of talk of the difficulties of scheduling urology visits and the children's soccer leagues, but the wait staff was tremendous and I will definitely make return visits here."}
{"text":"For being the only place close by it's not terrible. There isn't much flavor tho. The Pho is decent, but the fried rice and skewers weren't very good. There isn't anything special about this place tho. I'd go back if I was craving Pho tho. Wouldn't get anything else to be honest."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight was great.  Bowl of Pho is a welcome addition to the Beachwood / East Side area.  It presents a great atmosphere in a small space.

For our appetizer, my wife and I split the Cha Gio Ghay Spring Rolls - they were light and moist and delicious.  

Her entree was the Goi Du Du Papaya salad - she enjoyed it with the soy house dressing.

I had the Pho Ga Vietnamese traditional chicken noodle soup.  It was filled with flavor!  The noodles were soft and the chicken was tender.   I was concerned that the soup would be salty and there wasn't even a hint of it.   There was so much it felt like I left half of it there, but I was totally full.

We also had the Jasmine hot tea pot.  This was almost flavorless and I was expecting something more.  It was my first time trying this beverage so I have nothing to compare it to.

Our dinner was $32 including tip.  For a delicious hot meal in a nice atmostphere, it's definitely a restaurant and experience I highly recommend.  Here's hoping it does well, because I'll be going again."}
{"text":"Very good Pho.  Their Vietnamese sandwich pronounced \"baan-mi\" is one of the better ones I  have ever had.  I always get the deluxe pho with 3 kinds of meat.  I like this place, service is good as well."}
{"text":"Best Pho in Cleveland's east side. Great service and prices. Omelette are awesome too."}
{"text":"Folks!  It was ok.  Not at all impressive.  I found my bowl of pho bland and quite ordinary, on par with microwave Ramen.  In fact, I could have made better Ramen with just some peanut butter and chili oil.
If I were eating my particular dish blindfolded, I would think I was having canned chicken noodle soup with trail bologna and bean sprouts.  Plus, I felt the serving was too small- the old saying, you're hungry again in an hour after eating Asian foods.  I was still hungry as I was finishing my pho.  
Also, the folks sitting in there marveling over the Boba, (bubble tea, some like to call it,) this is kid's drink like a Slushee.  The first time I had Boba was in Los Angeles in China Town in the early 90's. I was 17 and the restaurant owners gave me a hard time for ordering it because I was too old to be ordering kid's drinks. This was a Taiwanese school kid's drink in the 80's that they would buy like American kid's would buy a juice box. 
I realize American adults are drinking it more and more but they talk about it like it's some sort of wonderful, exotic  gourmet experience.  You might as well treat the Circle K Icee machine that way."}
{"text":"Came in due to recommendations and the large amount of positive yelp reviews and I was not impressed. 

My bubble tea was not properly made...it was a blended ice slush though the flavor was good. 

My husband and I both had the beef pho. The broth was slightly sweet and not typical. I really wanted chili oil but only offered siracha. The meats in the pho didn't match those described in the menu. For example ours contained tripe and tons of cartilidge. 

The restaurant is small but really well decorated and clean."}
{"text":"They are probably one of the best Vietnamese restaurant in Ohio! My husband and I ordered pho and chicken salad, and they didn't disappointed me at all! Service are good and friendly..."}
{"text":"I had Pho Ga and Vietnamese sandwich. Both were very good. It's one of the best Vietnamese sandwich I have eaten so far. Even the pho tasted much better than many of Cleveland's better known Pho joints. Pretty clean and tidy. Reasonable price. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Here's a restaurant that lives up to its name. If you are making a Trader Joe's grocery dash and suddenly crave a good bowl of pho, just drive around the corner on Chagrin and hit up Bowl of Pho. 

The pho here is good, and being the only restaurant serving pho in Beachwood, it's worth your time to try it out if you haven't been yet! 
All expectations were met: you get your thin noodles, beef slices (plentiful and tender - yay!), and hot beef flavored soup (a bit oily - nay...). Accompanied by a plate of bean sprouts, jalapeño slices, fresh basil, and two sauce containers (Hoisin and Siracha). Great portion size. I also recommend ordering the variety of rolls for your appetizer. The Nem Nuong roll was a delight - although I secretly wish it was filled with many more mints and herbs! 

Overall - grab a friend and try out Bowl of Pho!"}
{"text":"Living on the Far East side means trekking downtown for pho is not always feasible. This has become our nearby standby when we crave pho. Service can be slow if busy but they are always friendly and interior is modest but clean and comfortable. We mostly get the pho which is tasty (beef is way better than chicken) and all the condiments are fresh. Garden (or summer roll) is solid. Everything is well prepared and hot when it arrives at your table. I've had better spring rolls but they are good nonetheless. Overall a good choice when the craving for a big steaming bowl of pho hits."}
{"text":"It was my kids birthday.  We got there 30 minutes before closing.  They were friendly, like it's ok tell us what you want.  Fast service, good food.  Best of all the waitress was really good, especially since it was kids bday!

Thanks"}
{"text":"it feels good to come here in the winter and have a nice hot soup. The other dishes are pretty good too."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried Pho this place will make you a Pho addict. The steak is always tender, the vegetables and noodles are delicious. Small, sometimes a wait but worth it. Check hours..  I w gone on a weekday and found it closed."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday. Moving from the East Coast where pho places are plentiful and wonderful, was happy to see there were pho places here too! 

My first impression when I walked in was a good one. Courteous and sweet people greeting us at the front door. Nice looking place.

There are two main reasons for the 3 stars. The menu/options and the food itself.

The Menu: For a place that has Pho in the title, there aren't a lot of pho options. I'm used to going to a pho place with the 14 standard pho options... variations/combinations of eye round, brisket, flank, tripe, tendon, or chicken. There was no tripe here! That's my pho go to! There wren't any options really. I was so sad. BUT to be fair there were vegetarian options my husband got to enjoy... not something you see usually. So instead of 2, it's a 3 star compromise. Good Vietnamese drip coffee, but that's not too hard to make. 

The Food: The broth had too much five spice, you lose the beef's natural flavor/brothiness. And the eye-round was cooked already, which is fine but there's something tender and lovely about raw meat cooking in your broth to show how hot the broth is... BUT the veggie pho was a nice mushroom broth so vegetarians don't have to worry about the food. 

Maybe next time we'll try the other dishes. But the pho was \"eh, okay\". Didn't fill my pho needs, but it was alright with legitimate vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I've gotten take out here at least 5 times and the pho is consistently good. I get the Pho Ga (chicken). They garnish with fried garlic instead of onions like I've had in other Pho restaurants. I like the crispy garlic better. The broth is really flavorful -- not watered down.  They're quick, efficient and the inside of the restaurant is really pretty looking. My favorite piece of decor is the fish in the lobby fish tank that look like all the characters from Finding Nemo. 
Thumbs up."}
{"text":"I ordered the deluxe beef noodle and I did like the pho. Maybe it was my selection, but I didn't really care for the meatballs included. Everything else was good, but I did feel that the pho was average or something was missing. I did receive a large portion and I had leftovers, they also gave you an assortment of additional items to add to your pho. I will be back again because the food was fresh and filling. But I will most likely try a different dish to see if I like that a little more."}
{"text":"Excellant food. Not greasy like a lot of other Asian places. Warm, cozy and clean place. Very reasonable. Everything $8-11. Excellant service. Bowl portions are large and plates are enough for good appetite. My first time having Vietnamese and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Moderately priced with adequate portion sizes. A fairly quiet atmosphere that is great for family dining  or for a date.  The Meat Crepe is only available  on weekends, and a must try."}
{"text":"Checked out Bowl of Pho on my lunch break today for the first time and it was delicious. Got my meal within minutes of ordering which was awesome. It's hard to find a place in Beachwood where I can get lunch within 30 minutes, however Bowl of Pho was the perfect spot. Service was outstanding! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great pho, great spring rolls, great service. One of my go to pho places. Always seated quickly."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a casual meal in this price range, I highly recommend this restaurant.  The restaurant is clean and the food is fresh.  The staff is very friendly and seem to enjoy working here.  

I gave the restaurant 5 stars because it was what I was looking for and they exceeded my expectations.   It is not a high end restaurant, but a good place for a bowl of Pho."}
{"text":"Great fresh food with huge portions. I went in for a late lunch the staff was friendly and attentive. The small bar seemed homey and a perfect spot to wait on to-go orders."}
{"text":"So i have been coming here far to often! In fact they all pretty much know what i would be ordering every time. Quite embarrassing but well then again i don't care. Always get number 32, the noodle salad esque with chicken and spring roll... Always start with the roast pork roll and tried bahn mi for the first time and totally smitten. Not the cheapest perhaps, but certainly close enough to come here often! 

Good food, good service and nice atmosphere. With tjmaxx and whole foods market nearby, this place is definitely a favorite! 

They also recently added alcohol to the menu, total plus!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese restaurant closed, so I came to Bowl of Pho one day when I had a hankering for pho.  I ordered takeout so I can't comment too much on the customer service.  When I walked in to pick up my takeout, the girl at the front seemed confused but another man quickly came out and handed me my order.  

I had the pho ga (chicken).  The broth was tasty, they gave lots of bean sprouts and culantro (i assume thats what the leaves were).  However, they gave a pretty small amount of chicken compared to competitors for the same price.  The seeds in the jalapenos were shriveled and brown, which makes me question their freshness.  The rice noodles were stuck together in a big clump in the styrofoam container, but they did fine after i manually separated them and put them in the broth.  The tiny cups of sriracha and hoisin sauce were fine for me because i don't like hoisin sauce and I only use a small amount of sriracha because i dont like things to be too spicy, but be sure to ask for more cups of sauce if you prefer a hardy amount.  I asked for no red onions so I can't comment on those, but I would've preferred a bit more of the white and green onions.

I also got the pork chop and rice for my grandmother.  The menu says that it comes with tomato and cucumber, but there were no tomatoes.  The pork chop was a nice size.  I didn't taste her dish, so i can't say much more than that. It was just a pork chop and a ball or plain white rice with a couple of cucumbers and lettuce on the side."}
{"text":"I've been here about 4 times over the past 2 years.  
Usually get the deluxe Pho.  I've found it consistently good every time I've been there. Food usually comes out pretty fast. Place got busy on a Wednesday night around 8 PM which I found unexpected since its located in an eastern suburb of Cleveland.  Service is very attentive. 

Ive not been impressed by the other menu items but since the word Pho is in their name I excuse this since I think their Pho is quite good."}
{"text":"Really amazing flavors and fresh ingredients! Spice profile is new and amazing to the western palate. Great bubble tea and Pho - but my two fav dishes are the aromatic wonton soup and the trio appetizer of grilled meats. Paired with each other it's a decadent lunch!"}
{"text":"If service wasn't frequently slow, I'd give them 5 stars. Cozy, comfortable atmosphere. Can get pretty busy at dinner time. I love the vegetarian Pho and spring rolls."}
{"text":"Very average pho place. Nothing good or bad about it that makes it stand out one way or the other. I mean, I was craving pho and this was the only place nearby. what I didn't like though was the kinda slow service and their really tight seating. I went during an off-time (2pm) for lunch and it wasn't packed but if it's peak lunch and packed, you'll probably get to know the people seated next to you. 

I had the pho tai, which is pho with rare beef. Again, it was fine, no big deal, it was regular pho. Kind of comforting knowing that most pho places are like McDonalds--they taste the same no matter where you go. 

I also had their egg rolls (the deep fried ones) and those were good too. Same review for the rolls, they're very average."}
{"text":"Very Nice service, decent food, not the best pho though.
Nice ambiance , cosy and clean, soothing jazz music was playing. The shed was flexible when I requested my food to be cooked without added sugar, they used sugar free soy sauce for my stir fried vegetables, which was very good . Unfortunately I didn't get pho because the broth has a little sugar in it, my husband got a bowl of pho and said it was not great. We love Vietnamese food and visited many Vietnamese restaurant across USA , this one was not very authentic but nice and decent food."}
{"text":"Dream location if you do the regular Whole Foods - Trader Joe's loop for your grocery shopping.  It's right there for a quick, healthy lunch between stops.

There is one major thing, though, that the Pho enthusiast would take major exception to, and should know before entering.  They don't put bottles of hoisin and Sriracha on the table. They insist on bringing you tiny sauce ramekins instead with your pho.  And if you want more, you have to ask for them...one...by...one, which the server brings to you each time more begrudgingly and grouchily than the next.   I understand that perhaps the restaurant is going for a \"nicer\" look and thus doesn't want to crowd the table with condiment bottles, but it comes off as miserly portion-control (You shouldn't be trying to save money on Sriracha and plum sauce; these are MAIN staples of Pho, like ketchup to a french fry). 

As for the Pho itself, it's a bit pricier than the usual, but when I tried it, it hit the spot, for the most part.  The broth was slightly sweeter than one would expect, but the noodles, vegetables and beef were prepared to standard."}
{"text":"Best pho around. I hate when the craving hits on a Tuesday because they are closed that day."}
{"text":"Not bad but like with most pho restaurants the seating is tight. 
Pho was nice but I can't remember much.
Tranquil setting
Would eat there again and I have."}
{"text":"Food was great. Resonable price for the amount of food you receive. Nice decor, family feel."}
{"text":"If for some reason you can't get to another pho restaurant, go here.  But it'd be worth your time and money to try to find a place that offers up some pho that's better flavored.  My \"Bowl of Pho\" was pretty mediocre.  Not inedible, by any means, I just felt like it had the \"essence\" of flavor but was lacking in the authentic tastes and smells that I associate with pho.  On the plus side, the bahn mi was good, although a bit bread heavy.  Also, spring rolls were delish!"}
{"text":"Solid lunch spot.  Service was prompt.  Food was excellent.  Wife had the pho with chicken, i had the vermicelli with chicken.  Both were flavorful and well done.  Will return."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, the prices very good. We had martinis, a papaya salad, as well as a satay tofu noodle dish. Kudos for the several vegan choices. I didn't realize the spring rolls were fried... A bit greasy for my palate, but overall good experience"}
{"text":"After hearing buzz from friends about a pho place located close to home I had to check the place out. Knowing that it's situated in a neighborhood close to Mayfield and ETON plaza, I had a feeling that it'd be on the pricey end so I figure the place would be worth it but nope, I was wrong. Inside the place looks nice but that don't let it fool you. The prices were unreasonable and the food tasted mediocre. Having to pay close to $13 for a bowl of pho, there are better places to get this at than here. I ordered their vermicelli with shrimp and pork which i believe was #28, don't remember how much it cost but there were plenty of vegetables than the meats itself. To me, that's kind of a ripoff. Being Asian and tasting so many other pho dishes from a variety of places, this place is just plain. 

I've experienced it better somewhere else and seeing that the owner looks familiar to Pho #1 in Asia town gives me the feeling that it's just another chain of theirs. I wouldn't go back. After paying our bill, the waiter short changed us so that was another downfall."}
{"text":"Update: This was my second visit to Bowl of Pho.  I didn't quite enjoy it as much as the first visit.  I had a craving for pho, which I normally get from Superior Pho (The Best, hands down!), but didn't want to drive downtown.   I ordered spring rolls, the cabbage chicken salad and the deluxe pho.  My dining companion ordered the meat skewer trio and grilled chicken over noodles.  The spring rolls were just ok, a little bit mushy and not a lot of flavor.  The salad was pretty good, but kinda skimpy for the $9.95 price and the pho was a let-down.   The meatballs didn't have much texture, the beef wasn't appetizing, there were pieces of tendon (I think) in the soup, which was off-putting and finally the soup wasn't served steaming hot, therefore, by the time I finished the contents of the soup, the broth was lukewarm, murky and not very good.  The accompaniments (basil, bean sprouts, lime & jalapenos), were fresh, but I agree with other Yelp reviews that the small dish of siracha and hoisin, was insufficient, I would have expected a bottle of each on the table.   

Maybe if I had not been to Superior Pho, this pho would have been ok, but once you've had the best, it's hard to settle.   

I would go back, but definitely wouldn't get the pho."}
{"text":"I have been there 5 times hoping it would get better.  If you need a quick fix for pho then it is just ok.  We always get the Pho Ga and they never serve it with cilantro, strange.  The chicken fried rice, wow very greasy, chicken chewy, and once the rice seamed old and crunchy, but it is always VERY GREASY!!  Spring rolls are tasty. They do need to get a liquor license.  
The service, horrible, horrible, every time!!!  I have been there when they are busy and been there when we were the only ones left to be ordering.  Sometimes I think we are invisible there.  There is one waitress there that knew us from a previous visit and still got bad service.  The worst part, the staff sits at the bar folding napkins and eating and that has happened on two occasions.  The server who knew us from the previous was eating at the bar and came to our table chewing the remainder of her food to ask if we needed anything else (we were done like a good 10 minutes earlier).   I was so appalled !!!   I make pho myself,  I do have to say it is better, but theirs is a good fix when I don't have time.  We do need Vietnamese restaurants on the Eastside without having to track downtown.  Looking forward to trying the new Vietnamese restaurant for Pho opening at Legacy!!!
Good luck Bowl of Pho!!  I hope to write a better review if things change!!"}
{"text":"Friday night I was gifted with a foretaste of heaven.

After shopping at Whole Foods and doing the wine pairings there, my wife and I went around the corner to Bowl of Pho in Woodmere.  Bowl of Pho is basically \"Bowl of Soup\", in my opinion a misnomer.  Had I named the restaurant, I would have called it something like Imperial Gardens of Vietnam.  Vietnamese cuisine emphasizes the freshness of its vegetables.  In a good Vietnamese restaurant all their cuisine features vegetables that are fresh from local growers.

I had the grilled shrimp with Vermicelli noodles as my entrée, but I started with a shared appetizer of spring rolls.  I've enjoyed Vietnamese cuisine for fifty years, and Bowl of Pho presented me with the best spring rolls I've ever eaten.

I've never been a fan of the spicy hot that a lot of guys I know eat to apparently prove their manhood.  That kind of hotness, for me, eliminates the flavors of whatever it is that you are eating.  On the other hand I love a kiss of hotness, and that is exactly what was provided with my entrée.  

Fifty years ago I began nearly a year-long study of the Vietnamese language at the Presidio of Monterey.  As I was reviewing the menu, I asked the Vietnamese gentleman, who, as it turned out, owns the restaurant (Mr. Nguyen Van Bi - we would say Bi Nguyen), why there was no dau nga diacritical mark above the My on his sandwich menu featuring Banh My.  I thought that that meant American sandwich.  He explained to me that I had it wrong.  No big surprise there, since I've gotten about a million things wrong in my lifetime.

Naturally, because I still retained some of my language training after fifty years, we went on to talk quite a bit, even though the restaurant was near capacity.  He was from the Hue area on the DMZ.  His father was a soldier in the Army of the Republic of South Vietnam.  After our duplicitous Congress decided to longer support South Vietnam in 1975 (the South had held off the communists for three years after we left in 1972), the south fell, mostly because China and the USSR immediately doubled their support of the North.  Bi's father was sent to a \"re-education camp\" for seven years. \"Re-education camps\" were actually concentration camps where those being \"educated\" were used as slave labor and fed a diet with very high salt content to maximize their work while minimizing the cost of the slaves' upkeep.

When the seven years of incarceration ended, Bi's mother made sure his father ate lots of meals featuring pig's kidneys to pull the salt from his body.

As the evening progressed, Bi (pronounced bee) introduced us to his wife, Nicole, and his nearly two-year-old daughter, Zoie.  Nicole, fully Vietnamese, may be more American than I am (and my ancestors came here on the Mayflower).  We had some great conversation with her.  My wife and I told her how impressed we were with our meals, and she shared some stories about the effort that goes into ensuring that the freshest of ingredients are obtained for their clientele.  She asked how it was that we'd heard about Bowl of Pho and I told her it was from Yelp.  She said that Yelp only rated the restaurant at 3.5 stars.  As you can guess from what I have written, I am quite familiar with Vietnamese cuisine, and Bowl of Pho is the best of the best.

Bi and I exchanged business cards, and I look forward to future conversations with him both online and at his restaurant.

But the evening's pleasures for me did not end there.  I could not help but hear parts of the conversation in the booth next to ours, and the gentleman talking had served in some of the same areas in which I had served (I was a Vietnamese Voice Intercept Operator for the Army Security Agency [cover name in Vietnam was Radio Research Units] and had been assigned to operations in Saigon, Nha Trang, Phan Rang, Dak To, Tuy Hoa, Phuc My, Cam Ro Bay, Hue, Phu Bai, Pleiku, Phan Thiet, Kontum, Cam Ranh Bay, and points betwixt and between).  As he got up to leave, I said, \"Welcome home.\"  We talked briefly and it turns out that he had retired as a colonel after twenty-seven years in the Army.  His first tour was with the 1st Brigade of the 101st Airborne in 1965.  My first assignments were with combat units of the 1st Brigade in 1966.  His next assignment was managing Arc Light operations (B-52 bombings of the Ho Chi Minh trails).  When I mentioned Army Security Agency, he said twice that, \"We used everything you guys sent to us.\"  That's a big deal for me and my fellow spooks and spies because we never got feedback on what happened with the intelligence information we provided to operational units.  I pointed out that we were the only intelligence unit to predict what was going to happen during Tet '68, and he confirmed that was the case.

I know I've digressed a bit from reviewing Bowl of Pho, but I think you can understand that I would be giving my dining experience there ten stars if I could."}
{"text":"Had a bowl of traditional pho and pork chop, both were surprisingly tasty.  The noodle appetizer was uninspiring.

I say surprisingly tasty because although lack the wow factor I have had at most major cities, it is very good considering its in a small town in Ohio."}
{"text":"This is probably the best place on the East Side for Pho. Decent strip mall location off of Chagrin Boulevard with easy access off of I-271. Well, as easy access as Chagrin Blv. can provide in Woodmere, but that's another story.

The service is generally pretty good, I notice that it can get a little wonky when the get busy. I usually order the 22 Pho Tai Beef or the Pho Ga Chicken. They also have a very good Bhan Mi. Prices are in line with other Pho places, perhaps a little on the high side because, it's in Woodmere ya know."}
{"text":"there's only a handful of places on cleveland that you can get pho. seriously like I can count them on my fingers, don't even need my toes. and i'm vegetarian so that takes that down to like 3 places. this is one of those, and i'm overall pretty happy with it. 
the place is not one of those hole in the wall asian places. it's actually pretty nice. at lunch, a lot of people who work in the area come in suits and ties. 
they have a whole section of the menu for the vegetarian options.
the vegetarian noodle soup, ok it's not the most flavorful, but it's a straightforward tofu, noodles, and soup. flavor it up with sriracha and hoisin sauce if you will. i'll take it any day.
also good here is their papaya salad, and the satay tofu.
the prices aren't terrible, pretty much cleveland standard. i try to make a stop to get take out whenever i'm near the area."}
{"text":"No more Bowl of Pho.
With a heavy heart I must write that I will no longer be a Patron of Bowl of Pho. As a regular customer since it's opening, I have found it to be a suitable, close to home replacement for Superior Pho Downtown.  Recently, the restaurant has been sold and is now not even a cheap Facsimile of the Former.   Over my last four visits out of dozens, yes I gave it four last chances, the protein portions in their Pho has become quite miniscule.  On my second last visit I asked the girl working the front counter if the place had been sold.  She replied yes, and said she was the new owner and why I asked.  I told that it seemed like her portions have gotten quite small and she said there had been no changes.  I asked her if I can have more meat and she begrudgingly did so.  Today I visited, giving my close to home friend one more chance.  Low and behold, I got my bowl of Pho, and the same portions.  I actually took out the meat and took a picture. Four or five pieces of sliced meatball, four pieces of meat, and a tiny portion of tripe.  During my latest visit to Superior Pho downtown, I took a picture of their Pho, you be the judge.  I know another issue with my fellow Yelpers is the ridiculously small amount of Siracha they provide. It keeps getting smaller and smaller. Today the owner was out and the manager on duty couldn't even open the cash register to give me change.  This man has been working there since day one, and can't even be trusted with the register. Shame.
Not to sound like Anthony Bourdain,  I must say Farewell Bowl of Pho, Farewell."}
{"text":"When I first found this place I was beyond excited that they had Vegetarian Pho, as it can be kind of hard to find in a place like Cleveland. That being said, I have yet to actually order the Vegetarian Pho because I keep getting distracted by all of the other delicious options! The food here is amazing. I'm a huge fan of Rau Cai Xao (stir fried veggies with tofu). It's honestly some of the best stir fry I've ever had from a restaurant, even if it is a bit over priced at $10. I've also had several of the other vegetarian entrees and appetizers, and they're all very good.

I would have given this place 5 stars, however we've ordered take out from here 3 times and had problems with it 2 of the 3 times. The first time they never prepared our order and \"lost\" the ticket or possibly gave it to one of the other people picking up. It would have been a 20 minute wait for them to remake it, so we left. Another time there were several pieces of chicken mixed into my vegetarian dish, which completely grossed me out and made the rest of my meal not edible. I haven't eaten in or taken out from them since that happened. I would definitely recommend this place to my meat eating friends, but as a vegetarian I will most likely stay away."}
{"text":"A cold day, a surprise afternoon off and a craving for pho brought me here for lunch one day, and it provided exactly what its name promised it would.

The restaurant is clean and decorated nicely.  After being seated, it took a while before a server noticed me, but service was ridiculously fast after that.  I had the #21, beef pho with eye round (rare).  It wasn't the best I've ever had, but did not disappoint.  The broth could have been a little more flavorful, but it wasn't anything a bit of lime juice, hoisin, jalapeno and sriracha couldn't quickly fix.  They were very generous with the add-ins, and the soup itself-- $9 got me a portion I couldn't possibly finish.

They don't have too many pho options-- two beef, one chicken and one vegetable-- but they do have a really extensive menu otherwise, including salads, appetizers, rice plates and a banh mi.  I don't know if I'll ever get around to trying anything other than soup, but their pho will definitely bring me back."}
{"text":"Pho has great authentic anise flavor, service is great and fast, get take out from this place at least twice per week! Deluxe Pho#22 is my absolute favorite!"}
{"text":"Meh, I've had better perfectly describes this place. My husbands Pho was alright, but my \"bun\" rice vermicelli dish with chicken was abysmal. They wouldn't let me get lemongrass chicken in it even though it was on the menu for another dish. The chicken it came with had a disgusting burnt BBQ sauce and the dressing had no fish sauce in it. It was basically the worst version I've ever gotten of my favorite dish at authentic Vietnamese restaurants. Utterly disappointing. I saw no one working here who looked relatively Vietnamese and their menu was tiny compared to other Vietnamese restaurants. I don't recommend Bowl of Pho for food other then pho."}
{"text":"I had the chicken fried rice and the Ban Mi Sandwich for Lunch. Very delicious and fresh."}
{"text":"I have now been back to this restaurant several times and must declare that I'm an even bigger fan now that when I initially tried Bowl of Pho for the very first time.  

To date items off the menu I've tried:
Pho:  Dare I say, I think this without a doubt the best pho in Cleveland.  My dinner date agreed and he knows good pho!   I've tried the chicken and the beef.  I like the beef a little bit more as I do find it a little more flavorful.  Seriously the pho here is legit guys. 

Summer roll: They give the option of grilled pork, pork and shrimp or just shrimp.  The summer rolls were fresh and tasty.  The pork was still hot from the grill.  Why is this important?  Well it means that they make these rolls to order and don't pull them out of a refrigerator from the day before. 

Pork noodle bowl:  Excellent flavor.  The pork was grilled to perfection and had that great smokey, slightly sweet flavor to it.  

Chicken cabbage salad: This was the only dish that I have tried that I did not care for.  I found the proportions to be off.  (Too much cabbage that was sliced to thick. The dressing was fairly flavorless and there was a mound of steam bland chicken breast on top).  I wasn't even going to say anything, but they must have suspected that I didn't care for it when I only ate the chicken off the top and the manager asked me if I wanted to exchange it for something else. More importantly she inquired about what I thought was wrong with the dish and how they could make it better the next time.  (First time that's ever happened!)

The restaurant itself is cute and they've done a very nice job with the space.  The ambiance is much nicer than any of the other Vietnamese restaurants that I have visited in Cleveland.  The presentations of food are nice with extra garnishes that are a thoughtful touch.  Does all of this compensate for their slightly higher prices? YES!!! The pho is about  $8-9.50ish depending on the type and  $4-5 for the summer roll depending on the type, but keep in mind you are also paying for their prime location.    

I should also mention that the service is excellent.  They were really well staffed when I went.  It's a new business and they are trying to build their customer base and it shows.      

Finally the east side has an excellent Vietnamese restaurant!   
5 stars for food!!
5 stars for service!!!
5 stars for location!!!!!"}
{"text":"Found this on Yelp when I was in Beachwood, OH. Only 30 mins walk from Aloft hotel. It's nice walking and seeing pretty interesting landscape. At first, I thought I was lost as I only see wholefood market but I walked a little closer and saw the sign. Very nice decoration, fish tank was clean and cool looking, all looked good. There were around 5 tables at the time when I got there. I sat down and ordered number 22. The waiter was really polite as he took my order and asked if I would like to drink anything besides water. I settled with water. Five minutes later the big bowl came! It soup isn't as hot as I expected but it was enough for me to jump right in. The rice noodle was nice, beef slice was good, beef balls were tasty. All the veg and chili are super fresh! Overall experiences were very good!"}
{"text":"Get the deluxe pho. The flavors are good. The decor and ambiance was surprisingly nice, especially for a small place in an unassuming strip mall. The place gets busy at lunch so get there early or expect a wait"}
{"text":"Came here with little expectations since I know there are \"superior\" pho places around the Cleveland area. However the food did meet my expectations. I ordered the deluxe version of their pho. The deluxe version added meatballs, flank steak, beef brisket and tendons in additional to the sliced beef eye round, noodles and greens that you'd get with their regular pho. 

The food came out very quickly and the server was pleasant. The pho was served with a side of bean sprouts, sliced lime, jalapeños, and basil. Sriracha and hoisin sauces were also brought out. 

The broth itself was not bad. It had a more airy taste than the broths at other pho shops. The broth tasted more herby. Perhaps its my acquired taste towards other pho broths, I didn't find this as good. The meats in the broth were too well done despite opting for the rare version of the sliced beef eye. Although it came with a variety of meats, I feel for $9.95, the quantity of each variety can be more. The noodles itself isn't too different, although it did seem thinner and slipperier. After finishing the noodles and meat, I left the broth to settle. Usually I would see the broth become \"cloudy\", but this wasn't the case with this broth. This indicates that the broth wasn't made with enough bone marrow or wasn't cooked long enough for the proteins to separate from the bones. 

All in all, this is a good place to grab lunch, especially this is the only place in the east suburbs that serves pho."}
{"text":"A great find tucked away off chagrin blvd. food was very good, and not expensive at all."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been looking for a good pho place since I just moved to Ohio from Michigan. I was shocked in how everything was 10 times better then what I was expecting. At first I thought the bubble tea portions were a bit small but for the taste and quality soooo worth the price!!! And don't even get me started on the pho!! I got the deluxe and I was so excited! All the ingredients were so fresh and delicious! It wasn't overly salty or too seasoned and it wasn't too overpowered by the beef scent which I've had issues with at other places.  And to top it all off our server Julie was outstanding. Me being a server myself can get a bit picky but I had no complaints at all. She went beyond what she needed to. Best date spot ever. Will 100/10 come back again!! I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a top quality service and top quality food!!"}
{"text":"This can't compare to Superior Pho, but it had what I needed for my Viet fix. I came on a random Wednesday night and this place had plenty of customers...looks like it's a local favorite.

The grilled pork rolls were very good and the pho was decent, if not above average. Unfortunately the pho's soup base lacked some flavor and the bowl had less noodles than I expected. I just wished that the restaurant would offer a bit more hoisin and sriracha sauce to make up for that lack in taste, but it is what it is."}
{"text":"I don't claim expertise in Vietnamese, so I won't make any claims to this being the \"best\" or \"most authentic\" Pho in town...

BUT it is darn tasty.  GIANT bowl of fragrant (anise, cilantro, scallion) beef broth with plenty of meat & rice noodles.  Big plate of add-ins so you can \"tune\" your lunch to your tastes.  Bowl is enough to share, and they are more than willing to accomodate.  We enjoyed the #22, \"deluxe beef pho\" (everything on the menu has a number, even the drinks).  I also liked the Vietnamese coffee (you should try it).  

My dining companion today was my 4 year-old daughter, she gave the Pho a strong thumbs-up too (although she ate the pho straight, no mix-ins), so you could bring kids here (there actually were a couple of other kids here during our meal) BUT there is no \"kid's menu\" , so if your child isn't game for the same kind of thing you're eating, better go carryout!

Banh Mi & stir-fry dishes at neighboring tables looked delicious too.  I'll be back for a return visit.

I didn't get a peek into the kitchen, but the dining area and restrooms were spotless.  Bowl of Pho is in the same strip mall as Whole Foods (around the corner).  It's kind of a small-ish spot, I could imagine it filling up at lunchtime, so arriving early seems a good idea (or doing carryout).  Pleasing ambiance, way nicer than your average \"fast food\" spot."}
{"text":"I love pho! Especially during the winter I can't get enough. I always get #23 the Pho Ga. It's chicken soup but so much better. Today we had Orlando helping us and he was awesome! Super friendly and nice. My husband got the #31 Bun Cho Ga. Loves it. He gets the extra fish sauce because he like to eat it like soup at the end!
We plan on returning a lot. Even all the way from North Royalton. Worth it!

Make sure you take a little candy from the dish before you leave. The orange are the best!."}
{"text":"Mom and I stopped in for lunch today to try Bowl of Pho in hopes that we would find a new favorite. Unfortunately we were not impressed at all with our meals nor the service. 
When we walked in, we stood at the door for about 10 minutes to be greeted and seated. It was not overly busy, but being that it was 12:30pm, there were several tables occupied by business casually dressed people so it must be a popular lunch spot for nearby businesses. 
I ordered the deluxe beef pho. They brought out a large plate of bean sprouts, basil and jalapeños so I was initially excited that the pho was going to be great. But then it came out and it was not steaming hot. The noodles were all caked up into a patty shape, like they had been heated and just set into the bowl, all stuck together, and the broth wasn't hot enough to finish cooking them. The beef was disgusting. The meatballs being the grossest, rubbery, inedible things. All of the other beef was all fat, and there was only 1 or 2 small pieces of each kind. The broth was tasty, but there wasn't enough of it for all the bean sprouts and noodles. I can usually never finish a bowl of pho, but I ate all of the broth and was left dissatisfied.  
She had the chicken and cabbage salad. She said it was tasty, but way too salty, and not as good as any other Vietnamese cabbage salad - and we've tried a lot. 
That's how I felt about the pho, too. Pho Thang Cafe downtown is much better. Go there instead for authentic and quality Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered take out but what a disappointment. First their online menu was down for reconstruction and their paper menu was not available because they were doing new ones. The first disappoitment was when we got home my wife's fried noodles were missing her egg roll. Next my chicken pho was missing the chicken except for a\"few shreds\". Whats with the main ingredient not there? The last time we ate there was a year ago and it was good but not now. They used to rank up there with the best in pho but not any more.This is probably the last time we eat there."}
{"text":"3-star food with 5-star service...  went there with my kids and the hostess and waitress were super nice!  Made us feel welcome and kids enjoyed the time there too :-)

Beef Pho - Pretty good; could be better much better if chef has paid more attention and skim the broth (ex. scum from meat).  The Pho soup should be clear and has great aroma. The Pho broth at this restaurant was mirky which comes from not skinning the broth constantly.  The beef slices were nicely prepared though - very tender and tasted good.  The beef meat balls found in the Pho needs work as it did not taste good at all. 

Service was simply excellent! Maybe my family got lucky with friendly hostess and awesome waitress.  Although food could been better I'd go back because of the good experience I had here.

Lastly price - Every item seemed about 10 - 15% higher than typical Vietnamese restaurant price.  Pho for $10?  Considering the location of restaurant, I guess price had to be raised to pay the rent. But for $10 for Pho I'd expect spectacular soup broth.

I'll go back there if I'm in the area though :-)"}
{"text":"Pho is in the name, so it has to be amazing, right? It checks the boxes of other pho experiences: plenty of condiments, bean sprouts, and basil. The pho was generously portioned, piping hot, and pretty tasty. But, missing from the trip was comfort and attention to detail. 

Our party of 5 was seated in a space for maybe 3 people. I was more a part of the neighboring party than my own. (Luckily, they were lovely, friendly people.) Drink options were sparse: the Vietnamese beers were out, leaving the ever-exotic Coors Light. 

The pho was good, but not overwhelmingly amazing. I've had pho with rich and flavorful broth that needed no additional ingredients. But, in a pinch this is pretty good, and not something I'd turn away to help shoo away the cold. 

I'll probably opt for take-out next time..."}
{"text":"Took the family there and boy, what a disappoint in service. One person waiting the entire restaurant. While this person was taking our order, which took a long while, the phone rang and she had to go get it. Apology or not, it was irritating. Additionally, the portion sizes were small and too many useless decorations instead of actual food. The only redeeming item is the pho broth tastes great."}
{"text":"I would describe it as authentic based on the number of Asian people I see eating there. I didn't learn about Pho until I was 41 and while Vietnamese sounds exotic, the ingredients are simple and common. Customs like putting pickles on a pork sandwich or adding mint isn't that different is it? The food is colorful, but not exotic in my opinion. Pho is glorified chicken noodle soup but it comes in an enormous bowl and is a little harder to eat. Like eating spaghetti with a soup spoon. Anyway, prior to a few places like this opening in strip malls, I only knew of a couple of Vietnamese places in the city. The whole menu is super affordable and healthy. I wouldn't recommend take out or going there for a quick lunch as I cannot eat the bowl quickly. Nor should you! We've tried about 5 different menu items besides the Pho and really enjoyed all of them. It's a great meal to eat before shopping at Whole Foods just around the corner."}
{"text":"I have been here on three occasiosn and the food and service have been consisitent each time.  Their portions are big and food is very flavorful. I am looking forward to going back and getting something else."}
{"text":"Pretty good Vietnamese restaurant. It's better than the others in the area. 

We came during lunch on a Monday and the place was packed. Service was a bit slow during lunch rush since there was only 1 waiter taking care of everyone. The Vermicelli noodle bowl was delicious (egg rolls, grilled meats or grilled shrimp.. or you can get all 3 combo). The Papaya salad was great; really refreshing. I would recommend getting the lime vinaigrette and get chili sauce. If you order it with tofu, it won't be grilled.. it's fried tofu. If you don't like deep fried tofu, you wouldn't like it. The pho was decent. 

Overall, good quality for the price."}
{"text":"This place was very good!! We had the skewers and Jasmin tea, super yummy. I had the chicken soup and added a little siracha and hoisin sauce, and was probably making inappropriate noises while slurping it in my belly. My husband got some kind of noodles with shrimp and steak, and was very please. We will go back!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  The broth was nice.  I had the  Beef Pho sans the tendon and organ meat, had eye of round rare,brisket(or so they say) and some other types of indistinguishable cuts.   The broth had a nice flavor but was lacking that punch.  If I had a cinnamon stick I would have to tossed it in. Maybe it was missing clove?   The girl whom I was with ordered the chicken pho.  It had a nice flavor.   My pho came out with the noodles in a clump.  Once I broke it up mixed in some jalapeños, lime , basil, and sprouts, I was ready to chao!

The pho was about 10$ a bowl, I think there should have had a bit more meat!  I was unable to finish all the noodles. . But still aprox 25$  for dinner for two is still quite reasonable.

Our server was really nice, she reminded us that drinks were cheap, like 1/2 price.  I did not have one , it would have been too much liquid.

Bottom line it is a good place and great location and you do not have to drive down to Clev's China Town!  I will be back!"}
{"text":"My experience at Bowl of Pho was an enjoyable one. Located in a plaza just east of 271 on Chagrin Rd, Bowl of Pho is, as far as I know, the first and only Vietnamese restaurant in the area, and it certainly makes a footprint. The decor is easily the best that any Viet spot in Cleveland has to offer. Intimate lighting, clean, classy booths and tables, mirrored walls. Definitely not what we're used in Cleveland, which actually made me worry a little bit about the authenticity of the food (not to mention how diverse the staff was). No worries though, because the food, for the most part, was authentic and on point.

What we ordered:

- Melon / Mango Bubble Tea - both your standard fare powdered smoothie. Good, not great.
- Banh Mi - Delicious, and LOADED with meat. Easily a standout on the menu.
- Banh Xeo (Vietnamese crepe) - Authentic and good, though I'm not a huge fan of the dish itself.  But it was full of bean sprouts, lots of meat, shrimp was tender and juicy, and the crepe was crepe-y. It reminded me of the Filipino \"fresh lumpia\".
- Bun Tom Thit Nuong Cha Gio - Typically my favorite Viet dish to order, they actually failed to deliver. Although they really hooked me up with meat portions, and the shrimp was delicious, they (1) forgot the egg roll and (2) the flavor was way off. They made up for the first offense by preparing it after bringing it to their attention, but it was a little undercooked. As for the flavor, I couldn't quite put my finger on it but the dish overall wasn't flavored correctly. My dinner partner agreed that it was good, but not accurate to the traditional vermicelli noodle dish.
- Pho Dac Biet - I had my reservations after reading some reviews, but came away pleasantly surprised. The soup was bursting with flavor with only a little bit too much cinnamon, and they were not stingy with the ingredients either. Lots of noodles, brisket, beef balls, and bean sprouts. Only a moderate amount of tripe though. Some of the brisket was served slightly undercooked, which as I understand is how it is supposed to be done, which allows it to cook in front of you to your liking.
- Che Ba Mau - A wonderful dessert that strongly resembles the Filipino \"halo-halo\". The filling to ice ratio was about a 5:1, which is probably the opposite for halo-halo, but it was still delicious. I would have liked a little less of the beans and more of the green jelly.

Despite the little hiccup with the cha gio, service was extremely friendly, fast, and attentive.  I found the prices to be very reasonable, and the portions were probably above average. I would definitely go again, and I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice, hearty bowl of pho."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 6 and our server was wise enough to ask us about how we wanted to be billed (separately in weird combos), prior to taking our order. This saved all parties a bunch of trouble later. I ordered #32 and was delighted by the flavors but had hoped the portion would be bigger. I'm comparing it to my other experiences with ordering this dish, which all had huge portions. The portions here were not small, per se, but I was expecting for more. The ambiance is nice and there is plenty of parking outside. Our dishes were served promptly, though not all at once. The food was solid and our server was very capable and friendly. Everyone else at the table enjoyed their food as well. All around a solid pick for a casual meal!"}
{"text":"Located in strip mall next to whole foods and tjmaxx. Great little spot when you need to get your pho fix. Really enjoyed there papaya salad. Service was quite good."}
{"text":"Called in 2 bahn mi's and 2 bubble tea's on my way home from work. Said it'd be 15-20mins. Got their in 10min. Went shopping around the corner for pet stuff. Killed 10min and went to get my food. Upon my arrival the place was empty with zero patrons. My bubble tea's were not made yet and my sandwiches weren't ready either. The gentlemen working their was very nice(young guy). He took my mop and I sat in the entrance as he made my tea's. He then told me the food would be just a little bit longer. All together I waited 10mins at the restaurant for my food. 

After I got home with the food:
I realized I am not a fan of bubble tea and I now know why I never ordered it in the past. The texture is bizarre and it was pure sugar. Had to try it once tho to find out. The bahn mi was fine. Not the best I've had but not the worst either. 

Likely won't return. I can make a better bahn mi imo"}
{"text":"Had a good carry out experience during lunch hours. I was greeted quickly by a friendly staff member. She let me know exactly what to expect in terms of wait (10 mins for two bowls of chicken pho), and that was spot on. The picture doesn't do the meal justice, one of the best bowls I've had. Great to know they're right around the corner. I'll be back regularly...next time to review a sit down"}
{"text":"Best pho I have had. Delicious broth, good quality of noodles and chicken.  Very reasonably priced at 8.95$ for the chicken pho.  They have bubble tea and banh mi which I'm looking forward to trying."}
{"text":"It's not the best pho you're going to have - not by a long shot - but the bowl is HUGE. They platter of condiments served with it is equally large and the service is awesome. The broth with the pho itself is probably a B- or B, but the service, the beauty of the restaurant, and the quantity with far make up for the shortcomings."}
{"text":"I'm no Pho expert but I've been here twice and really enjoyed it. The vegetarian spring rolls are very good and the vegetarian pho is delicious. The people I've been with on the visits have enjoyed the regular spring rolls, various fried rice dishes and meat dishes as well. The servings are generous for the cost (especially given the location) and the ingredients seem to be of high quality. The place is clean, conveniently located and the service was very good during both visits. It's definitely vegetarian friendly as well, which is nice. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"Clean, refreshing, and cute restaurant. Their pho is really really good and so are the spring rolls so far. I have been here many times due to a business trip and eat here every time. Will definitely return for their pho... I do think the staff needs to be a little more engaging and less bar huddle."}
{"text":"Nice service!
Even it's not authentic pho, but still delicious. I got my stomach full enough for a bowl of pho!"}
{"text":"Beware: I decided to try this place out because it's near the hotel Im staying at.  I dined in last night and 1) had a very watered down thai iced tea and 2) chicken pho that had roasted onions in it? Oh..and a piece of hair! This hair was deep in the bowl so you can only imagine how disgusted I was after already having a few sips.  The service was not so great either..yes they were friendly but I had to advise I wouldn't pay for the pho.  I was still charged for the Thai tea...a good business wouldnt have charged anything if a customer were to have this type of bad experience. Not that I really care about the cost..I was also sick all night not sure whether physical or just psychological over the disgust of sipping hair pho!  Will never return!"}
{"text":"4 stars for Bowl of Pho is appropriate enough---their service was decent. Very clean restaurant. Decor was quite fancy for a pho restaurant. Food: Spring roll--was pretty good. Pho: the noodle quality was okay, I could tell my pho noodles were from the dry package and the noodles were left out to sit. Normally pho restaurant would use the fresh noodles, which taste better. The broth was pretty delicious. I wish they would bring out the bottle of Sriracha --instead of squeezing it onto a dipping dish. Bubble Tea: average. I didn't get to try the other things on the menu. 

P.S. I'm vietnamese and a visitor of the cleveland area"}
{"text":"Very nice.   This place rocks.  Great soup.   Spring rolls    Pho GA      was fabulous.  It's authentic with great service.    Love it."}
{"text":"The service was outstanding! Ambience was very nice. The garden rolls were very good and fresh. My husband got the pho and he enjoyed it very much and they were not stingy with the veggies. I got the chicken pho, which I have never ordered before and cannot compare to a prior experience but it hit the spot on a rainy cold day!"}
{"text":"Not many Vietnamese restaurants in this area so I am glad to see them. Their pho's soup is very tasty beef based. Thier other food items are probably good, but I only have Beef Pho here. Lots of customers and good dining atmosphere. They turned on country instrumental which I think adds to a wonderful atmosphere. When I was there, they played George Straight's \"Check Yes or No\"."}
{"text":"This our favorite place to go for Pho. The atmosphere is clean and modern.the Asian Town Center where it located is as close to an Asian experience as this westside suburbanite will ever get. It's always busy at lunch so come early for quick seating. The waiters are always friendly and helpful. We always get Pho and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Pretty average pho. Nothing to write home about, but if you were in the mood for pho I wouldn't shy away from this place. 

Garden roll seemed fresh and was tasty!

Great service."}
{"text":"I was so happy to hear of a Vietnamese restaurant in the burbs so close to home and couldn't wait to try it! The place is kind of hidden in the shopping plaza where Whole Foods is located (around the corner from Pet People.) 

It's super cute and clean inside and we had great service. We had #28 pho, summer rolls and the chicken and cabbage salad. It wasn't the best Vietnamese food I have ever eaten in my life but the food was VERY good! They even have vegetarian pho available.  And it's in a safe neighborhood with lots of parking. 

 *bonus* 
We were able to sample a shrimp soup they were thinking of added to the menu and I really hope they do add it b/c it was incredible. It had pineapple in it - if you see it on the menu or as a special, order it!"}
{"text":"Great little pho restaurant! Food is consistently good and the service is great. I LOVE the chicken pho!"}
{"text":"Walking into the restaurant we were a bit worried about how authentic the food was going to be. There aren't too many Asian restaurants around this area, and the few that are here serve American fusion cuisine...nasty fusion cuisine, I have to add. I came here with my Vietnamese friend, so the first test was to see if any of the staff could actually speak Vietnamese. Luckily our hostess/waitress spoke Vietnamese, test #1- check. It was another cold winter day in CLE so we definitely ordered pho (the deluxe beef noodle) as well as the grilled noodles- which have grilled shrimp, meat, and spring rolls with vermicelli noodles. For starters we got the grilled pork rolls. Test# 2 was obviously how authentic and good was the food- mainly the pho. I have to say, my friend and I thought the pho broth was quite decent. Maybe 2nd or third best in CLE that we've tried so far? I trust my friend's opinion, since she was born and raised in Vietnam- who would argue with someone that has eaten pho all her life?! Haha for restaurant standards, it was good, and filled our pho cravings. (If I had to compare it to homemade pho....well, there's no comparison.) The only slight downside to the pho here is, they give slightly less meat than I'm used to seeing. For me personally, I'm ok with that since I don't eat huge amounts of meat. For others, they may be slightly disappointed? Maybe order extra meat with your pho? 
The grilled noodles and pork rolls were good. I think it's hard to go wrong with more simple dishes like that. I like that they grill the rolls here, the taste is more delicious than the plain rice rolls served at other restaurants. 
The prices are slightly higher than other Vietnamese restaurants that I've been to, but then again the area is slightly more upscale as well. Our waitress was very friendly and sweet, and checked in on us to make sure everything was good. Overall it was a good experience and we would probably come back if we were in the area again! You passed both tests- congrats haha!"}
{"text":"The food was good! I had the tofu kao piak and although I had to add tons of flavoring I was pleased with the outcome. The only thing I didn't like is that the sticky rice did not come with the meal, it was expensive and not enough for the extra charge. Minus one star."}
{"text":"In on business and was looking for quality Pho experience. Paid for broth and noodles essentially, there was no flavor and nothing else in it really. The scallions were about one top portion of the stem cut up. 

Host/manager and wait staff were arguing at the bar. Host/manager had an attitude the entire experience."}
{"text":"Quite delicious beef pho. Fresh, with large portions. Pretty hard to complain really. I liked it."}
{"text":"Bowl of Pho is solid. With so few places on the east side to get pho, I had to follow through on my long-standing bookmark for this place.

Located in the Whole Foods shopping center of Woodmere, Bowl of Pho is situated between a florist and some other small shops. There isn't much ambience of any type in the restaurant, but even on a Sunday night it's packed and bustling with patrons. Their menu is pretty diverse with veg and non-veg options, but also maintains a pretty authentic Vietnamese feel. 

I can't dispute that the service is fast. If you're in a rush, this place will help you get in and out. My Mom and I ordered the pork rolls, which were surprisingly some of the better ones I've had on the east side. Really great crunch with fresh veggies tucked in the delicate rice paper. Yet, what we really came here for was the pho. As a pho enthusiast, I've tried oodles of noodles around the Greater Cleveland area. My beef pho satisfied my craving, and the broth had a sweeter taste to it. I liked it, but it wasn't the best to-die-for pho I've ever had. I'm definitely down for a return trip to try more things off their colorful menu."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving weekend vegan drama! Family was in town, and we had to pick places to eat that were veg/vegan friendly, due to a couple party poopers' stances toward harming delicious, delicious animals (just kiddin' -- I love my filthy hippie relatives). And they were staying in Woodmere, so this was the first place that popped up on Ye Olde Cell Phone Search. I am honestly not a huge Asian fusion/Vietnamese fan, but this place definitely offered up the delicious. Of course, I had the seared pork chops, which were awesome. Other people ordered special dishes and/or fried rice and/or pho. We all shared, and there was goodness all around. Might not personally be my first choice, but this place gets two thumbs up."}
{"text":"We've been here many times and the food is solid.  I usually get the vegetarian pho which is great and my husband likes the regular pho.  The summer rolls are usually fresh.  Recently I tried the spring rolls over vermicelli, which was very tasty, but the spring rolls were just a bit too oily.  They recently started serving sriracha in little bottles which is awesome because they used to serve it in very small portions.  The service is usually good."}
{"text":"Stopped in one cold, wintry, snowy evening for a bowl of Pho!

I was promptly seated. I ordered the fresh garden rolls with shrimp and a bowl of Pho Ga.

The rolls were fresh, with lots of crisp herbs. The plate of aromatics for the Pho were also fresh looking.

The Pho itself - I tasted the broth without adding anything - I like to understand and experience the flavor baseline before adding anything - was a light, tasty chicken broth. I added the bean sprouts, lime wedge, jalapeños, and Basil. And proceeded to slurp my way through the bowl - applying prodigious quantities of Sriracha sauce to individual bites and to the broth.

The only thing I will ding the restaurant on - is there was a very loud child who apparently is part of the family of whomever runs Bowl of Pho. The child spent most of the time during my visit - very loudly running around the restaurant - making shrieking noises. It was rather loud and annoying.

#BowlofPho #PhoGa"}
{"text":"My go to Pho place in Cleveland. The broth is flavorful & balanced. a lot of Pho places tend to get heavy on the cinnamon but here, it's well balanced. The Vietnamese coffee is a must try for coffee lovers and the summer rolls are made fresh, which makes a big difference. The staff is always attentive & courteous. Adding a shaking beef dish would make this place even better"}
{"text":"Great quality Vietnamese food. The dining area is not too big, but the waiters are attentive. The spring rolls were not very tasy (too fried), but the deluxe beef noodle pho was delicious."}
{"text":"Not bad! At the same time not as flavorful as other more authentic Vietnamese restaurants in the region"}
{"text":"First time experience at Bowl of Pho. Great food and friendly service. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Two words: vegetarian pho.

Stopped in over the weekend for lunch.  I was surprised to see how packed the restaurant was.  The staff seems painfully new, so we waited for what seemed like a long time to get drinks and to place our orders but hopefully that gets better in time. (they haven't even been open a month yet)  Our waitress also hadn't tried a lot of the menu items, so she wasn't all that helpful giving us suggestions on what to order.  But at least she was pleasant.

We started off with the vegetarian spring rolls. They were definitely homemade.  And were definitely delicious.  I've never had the opportunity to try pho before, so I ordered up a big bowl of the vegetarian variety.  It didn't disappoint.  Well, it didn't disappoint until I made it too spicy by adding things, but that's my own fault.

My boyfriend had a dish that seemed like pho without the broth.  It was a shrimp and beef noodle dish.  He's generally not all that into ethnic eats, but he slurped down the whole bowl.

This new restaurant is definitely worth checking out.  And as an added bonus, unlike some of the other pho serving joints around town, your car won't get broken into and you'll feel safe walking alone in the parking lot!

P.S. I thought the restaurant was a little hard to find.  It's in the Whole Foods shopping plaza."}
{"text":"I was craving Vietnamese food today (yet again) so I decided to try someplace closer than 31st & Superior.

Firstly, I'll say that the woman who took my order over the phone was very nice. Bowl of Pho is also nice on the inside but I ordered my food to go so I can't really comment on their waitstaff.

Since everyone, their mothers and their grandmothers praise Superior Pho and pretty much claims everywhere else is mediocre (at best), I wasn't really hoping for the best. I was just hoping it was edible.

I ordered 2 orders of spring rolls, bubble tea (strawberry), fried rice (chicken), and deluxe beef noodle.

The bubble tea, while good, tasted... odd but not in a bad way though. It was very sweet and it tasted like a red licorice shake. O.o

Luckily, I love red licorice. But it definitely didn't taste like strawberry, not even remotely. The tapioca pearls were good too and in my opinion, they were better than *gasp* the ones at Superior Pho.

The food was pretty good too. The pho (which was my main dish) was terrific with a multitude of flavors and spices that hit the palate just right. Nice amounts of meat (not an overabundance but not super shady either). I had my food to-go so when I got home, I put in the the meat, sides and noodles which, because I'm  assuming they don't rinse off their noodles, were super starchy and was kinda congealed to the styrofoam to-go container. However, after me breaking it up a bit and placing them into the pho, they broke up a little bit so it wasn't just clumps of ramen sitting at the bottom of my bowl.

The chicken fried rice my husband ordered was really good.

The spring rolls were good as were the sauce but I have to admit that Superior Pho is well, superior with their spring rolls and the sauce (oh dear God, their sauccceeee!!).

All in all, I came in not expecting much and now I'm full of delicious food and a new Vietnamese spot to eat at when I don't want to trek all the way downtown.

Oh! Also just as important, they are slightly less expensive than other places I've been too. That's always a plus to me!"}
{"text":"My go-to Pho place in Cleveland! I just love the food here, for takeout or dine in. They also do delivery through seamless."}
{"text":"Just a quick update.

Still great food and service.  I got a few more coworkers hooked on Pho and pork rolls. I tried the Pho Gai - chicken noodle pho this time. Simply delicious.  I still prefer the beef Pho but either one is a good choice."}
{"text":"The pho is hot and large and tasty, and everyone who's in the know knows this place is awesome sauce. Don't mind if I do!"}
{"text":"I'm so torn about this place.  Every time I go, I love it, and its incredibly convenient for lunch, but I can't shake the fact that this place is the #2 pho place for me.  I can't give 2 pho places 5 star review, can I?

Seriously though, you can't go wrong here for Pho.  This place is quality.  Sandwich is great, pork rolls are some of the best around and the atmosphere is wonderful.  Always crowded and always a lunch hit!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of the area so I was looking for a good pho spot on a chilly, winter evening.  I was pleasantly surprised to come across this place, which was very close to my hotel.  I wanted to order delivery to avoid having to go out in the snow/rain/ice slush but the online ordering through their website was offline.  When I inquired with the 3rd party vendor who manages the delivery orders they advised that the restaurant had taken themselves offline due to staffing shortages and there was no eta on when they would be back online.  

Fast forward, I called to place a take out order and the hostess advised they do have delivery and she had no idea why they would be offline on their delivery service.  No attempt to find out or see if they could deliver or delve into the problem further.  Guess she wasn't too concerned about it.  I placed an order for a combination pho and it took about 15 minutes for my order to be ready.  Overall the packaging and accompanying items to my pho were all there and it was a generous sized portion.  The flavor was lacking compared to pho I've had at other places so it was a pretty average meal for me and nothing spectacular.  Will I come back to this place, probably not, but at least I can say I ventured to try something other than the usual chain variety restaurants in this area.  Oh and by the way, this place is closed on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"The restaurant had a very clean and nice atmosphere with friendly staff. The menu has many nice Vietnamese options. I ordered mango bubble tea which was on point!!! To eat, I got the bun tom & thit nuong. My fiancée makes this dish at home, which I prefer. BUT it was still very good and I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't live with a Vietnamese master chef! ;)"}
{"text":"I have eaten here three times now and I always leave satisfied. The Pho is delicious, the staff is gracious and attentive and the restaurant is clean and attractive. Great place to enjoy a delicious meal on the east side of town."}
{"text":"Bowl of pho definitely looks appetizing for this cold winter night.  Came here with the husband because he wanted soup and it was on the way home from shopping at Trader Joe's.. 

We were seated fast as soon as we walked in which was great!  The place was busy so we expected a wait when it came to getting our food.  We ordered the spring rolls and 2 of the number 22 pho.  The spring rolls was delicious along with the pho.  The pho was on the sweeter side compared to many of the pho restaurants we have been to.  The service was fast and the people were so friendly!

So a lot of reviews I've seen on here talks about how the noodles are stuck together.  To those beginner pho eaters.. They have to prep the noodles first and place it in the bowl prior to putting the broth in there... so once you get your bowl of pho you need to get your eating utensils (chopsticks) and separate the noodles before they fully cook and get stuck together for the remainder of your pho eating experience... 

Anyway... They give you just enough garnish for your pho (bean sprouts, basil, like, and jalapeños).  Although the broth was delicious, I don't prefer my pho that sweet, so I had to add jalapeños for a kick and lime to tone down the sweetness. 

All in all, this place was great and if you're looking for a delicious sweet type of pho, come on in!"}
{"text":"I've been to Bowl Of Pho a couple of times now, and I can say that their pho is really good. There broth is very rich and delicious! That, paired with fresh vegetables, and great service, make this a great lunch or dinner spot. At my last visit, I tried their Bánh Mì, which is such an awesome and comforting blend of flavors. You get that crispy bread, ham, and pâté, warmed by fresh chili pepper, then cooled by the fresh veggies, at a great price. Also had the pork Gi Cun, which was outstanding! What a great lunch!"}
{"text":"I was looking for something quick but good before I got back on the highway, and I rolled right past this.  A quick Yelp search told me it got good ratings and was the most interesting thing in the immediate vicinity, so back I went.  

I needed some caffeine but it was hot out, so I got a Vietnamese iced coffee.  Very cool French drip setup, with strong coffee and condensed milk.  I'm not a big coffee drinker and it was a bit strong for me; I would have liked more sweetness.  But it was refreshing in a couple of ways.

I had the #32 for my meal; can't remember the name, but it was grilled vermicelli with pork and spring roll.  Tasty marinated meat, good noodles, a crunchy and flavorful spring roll, and fresh veggies.  Very good.  

The place is small.  Service is friendly but slow- well, fast when I got there, slow as the meal went on.  I would go back often if I was in the area- I think the slight slowness was a fluke, and the menu is full of interesting choices, plus I was very happy with my meal overall."}
{"text":"We went to Bowl of Pho for Father's Day, and we had a great experience.  The staff was extremely professional and courteous.  We had two small children, and they were very accomodating.  The traditional chicken noodle soup is awesome, and the appetizer sandwich was one of the best sandwiches that we've tried in a long time.  Overall, great experience and will return!"}
{"text":"Terrible! Bowl of pho was barely hot, barely anything in the bowl waste of money you would think Pho would be they specialty by the name of it but nope....Workers were really nice tho that about it"}
{"text":"Very cold night and I was looking for a restaurant that served soup. I am glad I stopped in to Bowl of Pho. The Pho was a huge portion of hot and savory broth filled with rice noodles, slices of beef and herbs and spices. I also received a plate with various garnish to add to the Pho such as bean sprouts, mint leaves, jalapeño slices and lime wedges.  To finish of my dinner I enjoyed a hot Vietnamese coffee that was smooth as velvet and sweet! The staff was very friendly and I felt like one of the regulars even though it was my first time at Bowl of Pho."}
{"text":"The food was good the service was terrible. It seemed like my family was made to wait a long time when seats were available. We were told it would be 5 minutes but it was more than 15. On a side note Google said they wouldn't be busy. not true.We never got drink orders. Water was just sat on our table after 10 minutes. This sucked because I wanted some bubble tea. 10 minutes later still no order was taken. No silverware or napkins were provided. I thought it might have been something that came with our dinner but that was not the case they just neglected to bring
 us any. When waiter did come he wasn't warm. Luckily we knew what we wanted to order. We both got the chicken Pho. I also ordered some rice for my son since there really isn't any real kid friendly choices on the menu. The Pho was good but I will stick to Saigon on downtown Cleveland the workers are much more polite and treat you like they appreciate your business."}
{"text":"Update: we went back. It's just convenient.  When Server Sassypants took our order, we requested several menu items just as they were listed.  He didn't write it down, so I made two predictions: one, he's going to mess up our order.  Two, he's going to blame it on us.  Unfortunately I was right on both accounts.  Have you ever heard a grown man whine with an inflection, \"But you said pho dac biiiiieeeet...\"? It's about as pleasant as it sounds.

Do the owners read these reviews?  They should know what their staff is doing to help their reputation.  

Oh, and the food?  Still meh. But it's within arm's-reach."}
{"text":"My sister and I decided to dine here on a Monday for lunch because our favorite pho spot was closed. This place definitely hit the spot. We both ordered the pho tai and a Vietnamese coffee. The pho tai was solid! I love that they provided us a ginormous plate of sprouts, limes, Thai basil and jalepenos to put in our pho. You definitely will get your money's worth with their portions.  The Vietnamese coffee was very rich and filling. I'd never had it before, but it was delicious. It's some pretty strong espresso with sweet and condensed milk. You don't need to add a thing to it; just stir and enjoy. Couldn't believe the bill for us two came out to under $30. Go enjoy this great little pho spot!"}
{"text":"I was on the road when it started to pour down rain/snow. Not that I can't drive in that stuff, but the rest of the idjuts on the road were struggling. I had a long drive and a late night ahead of me, and I was jonsing for some hot soup. Saw the sign and pulled in. Love me some Pho!

The service great. Super swift, very courteous, and understanding of my sheltering from the rain bit. It was really cold inside, though, and I was never able to take my coat off. I could see this being the neighborhood haunt for locals, it wasn't somewhere I'd go out of my way to eat. The folks that did come in all seemed to know each other.

The food was just meh. Really, nothing to come back for (unless you are a local and get to know the owners, who are very sweet). Seriously, though, not as great as people are trying to make it out to be. The broth was bland and I had to ask for cilantro, lime, etc. They had a flan-like dessert that my server raved about. It tasted like...flan. Good flan, but just flan. The menu was typical of a Pho place, except for that flan."}
{"text":"excellent pho for a fair price. highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"It was a nice place with a decent selection of items. The food was served quickly and had a large serving. Dont let the outside fool you, inside is decorated nicely."}
{"text":"If there was an option for 3 !/2 stars, I would have picked it.  It certainly is the best atmosphere for explore Cleveland's Vietnamese scene and I love that we now have a Pho option on Cleveland's east side...however, I don't think Superior Pho or Minh Anh are going to feel threatened to lose their title of offering the best Pho in Cleveland.

Certainly a worthwhile visit with a well-rounded menu, Bowl of Pho offers very nice food experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing service! Our server was so great and helped us to decide what to order since it was our first time. He made us feel comfortable since we were clueless! The pork roll and spring roll were both delicious! We also had the chicken pho and fried rice! Everything was so flavorful  and very authentic! Definitely worth the hour drive we made!"}
{"text":"I live on the east side and had a craving for pho and had no desire to make the trek downtown.  I usually go to superior pho or the cafe in Asian town center (this is the absolute best spot for pho in my opinion) but this was a great alternative to driving 20+ minutes. The Vietnamese coffee was fantastic!  I orders the deluxe beef pho and was disappointed in the amount of meat I got.  But overall it was a good experience. I enjoyed the entire bowl and will most likely return.  Good service and nice little place.  If you're willing to travel I would absolutely recommend you try the cafe as Asian town center though."}
{"text":"Nice, clean, warm, friendly place. Very good Phó! Very good service with lots of smiles."}
{"text":"Pretty good basic pho. The broth tastes great with decent variety of beef-cut. I would come back :)"}
{"text":"Pho was born in Northern Vietnam during the mid-1880s. The dish was heavily influenced by both Chinese and French cooking. Rice noodle and spices were imported from China; the French popularized the eating of red meat. It is believed that \"pho\" is originated from \"pot au feu\" a French soup. Vietnamese cooks blended the Chinese, French and native influences to make a dish that is uniquely Vietnamese.

Stopped in to Bowl of Pho with my co-worker today and we learned how to say Pho correctly.  It's pronounced, 'fa'.  Anyway, I ordered the Com Chiên - Fried Rice with shrimp.  Mark ordered the Pho Tái - Beef noodle with beef eye round.  Mark liked his Pho and after he added some of the sauces into the Pho, he liked it even more.  My fried rice was sticky and tasty.  The five shrimp were perfectly cooked and delicious, but the portion could have been larger.  I mean, you get a ton of Pho in a bowl dishes, but not a ton of rice in the stir fry dishes.

Anyway, the quality of ingredients is outstanding here.  The food is really good and the service is solid.  With tip, lunch was $13.80 with water to drink.

Recommend!"}
{"text":"Yelp nearby led me this location despite strip mall appearance from the front the inside seating was nice and was very busy at lunch. I had the shrimp spring rolls very good and the Pho set w beef broth but all vegetables and tofu. It was good but could have been hotter in temperature and was not very deep in flavor as I have had elsewhere. Added some spices to kick it up overall good if your on the East side of Cleveland."}
{"text":"What can I say??
This place is always on point.
The Bubble Tea is Amazing!! Today we had Strawberry and Mango and they are great!!

The Beef Bowl is the way to go. Taste good and comes to the table hot!!"}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh food in a beautiful atmosphere and quick service...and if that's not good enough, the prices are reasonable.  My husband and I were so impressed with this lovely restaurant for dinner.  Don't let the outside fool you, this place is a gem. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I went here early Sunday evening for dinner. My first time here and it was in a little plaza right around Whole Foods market by chagrin boulevard. For a Sunday evening they had a few customers in the restaurant. They have a small bar space and a nice booth and table area. The place is clean and welcoming. We were able to seat anywhere since there weren't a lot of people in there. I started off with a Vietnamese beer and spring egg rolls for appetizer. The beer was delicious and paired nicely with the spring rolls. The spring rolls are much smaller than typical egg rolls but it was delicious. It comes with dipping sauce that went well with it . For dinner I got shrimp and chicken vermicelli, Banh Mi ,and stir fry vegetable and rice. The Banh Mi for the price and the amount of meat and flavor was very delicious . It is listed as an appetizer but you could definitely eat it as a meal. The shrimp and chicken vermicelli was my favorite. It comes in a big bowl with their sauce in the side which you have to mix in. The flavor of the rice noodles, shrimp, chicken and the all vegetables went well together and refreshing. The only thing is I wish they would give is a little more meat. The stir fry vegetable and rice was okay dish for me.  Overall the food is very good, the service is very nice, the atmosphere is welcoming and I definitely will be back to try more of their food!"}
{"text":"The Pho was yummier than most places the atmosphere is great for a lunch date or dinner. It was not over crowded the staff are friendly and helpful"}
{"text":"Southeast Cleveland pho is a good kind of pho because it's the closest pho to where I live.  I've had pho in Cleveland and Columbus, so I am by no means a pho expert, but this rates as good pho.

They have one size pho (beef noodle soup) and the presentation, portions, and ingredients are similar everywhere I go.  It seemed like there was a little less beef in this than others I've tried. Fiancé had not tried pho to this point and loved it.  She wanted to try chicken noodle soup but I talked her out of it, but maybe on our next visit.

The restaurant itself is nice, but not overly large, and was 110% full, with people waiting.  Seating is very close, and you can definitely hear conversations on each side of you.  There is bar seating as well."}
{"text":"The pho is superb! Everything is fresh cut, you are able to spice it up as much as you like and the flavor is superb... Look no further if you are craving it and don't feel like going downtown, you won't be disappointed..."}
{"text":"The definition of having a bowl has changed drastically for me over the years. It now means some Vietnamese soup. I felt a slight tickle in my throat today. I wanted some pho for lunch. I work out in the land of the lame: Solon, OH so ethnic foods are just a dream. I called my friend and we went for a bowl of pho 8 miles up the road in Woodmere. The service was fantastic. The place was packed at around 1:30 pm and they got us in and out pretty quickly. I still prefer Minh Anh to any pho in the city but this will do in a pinch if you are out for lunch in the eastern suburbs of Cleveland."}
{"text":"I don't really venture out of Downtown for my Pho, so this way my first foray into East Side Pho.  I have some ride or die Pho places downtown that are on the weekly rotation of lunch spots. So when I recently popped into this small Vietnamese restaurant on a rather gloomy day, I wasn't sure what to expect. 

I sat at the bar and my server/bar tender was nice and friendly, I placed my order right away as I alway order rare beef & brisket Pho.  Unfortunately they only have 3 Pho options - chicken, beef(rare beef), and fully loaded.  I wasn't quite hungry enough for the fully loaded option so I just ordered the Rare Beef Pho.  
Full disclaimer - I need to let you know I tried nothing else from the menu so I'm simply critiquing Bowl of Pho on the bowl of pho I received. Now without further ado....the Pho.  My pho came out moderately hot, I prefer hotter.  There was an oily sheen sitting on the top of the broth, which I was not expecting nor did I like.  The beef pieces were small and NOT rare.  The noodles were okay, I little light on the portion compared to other places I've visited.  It was also accompanied by bean sprouts, jalapeños, limes, basil, and sirracha and hoisin sauce.  I went ahead and doctored up my Pho how I like it, took a slurp, and was disappointed.  The broth flavor was not complex, there were no lingering hints of cinnamon.... The oily broth is also something that was not enjoyable and I think the noodles were a tad over cooked. i don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"We were visiting extended families here, and were looking for a place to eat late lunch. I have offered to stop at a sandwich place. And of course my two very important men in my life said absolutely no to that. They do not want bread. They wanted noodles. To be more specific, Pho. I rolled my eyes and said, hello, we are in Ohio for goodness sake, not Northern Virginia where we are from where on every corner you have Pho and Peruvian chicken restaurants. Why don't we stick to something more American like... I don't know, burgers? But the answer was still, big N and O. They absolutely wanted Pho. And so I Yelped, and were able to find a nice place nearby to satisfy my two very hungry men. Thank you Yelp for saving my family! 

This place was cozy and nice. Meticulously kept and everyone was greeted with a smile. The spring roll appetizers were great hit with my husband. And pho with extra meatballs satisfied my son's tummy so much that he took a long nap afterwards. I enjoyed my chicken pho too. 

Pho's soups are different at every restaurant, and I think here it is on the sweeter side. Its easy for even the ethnic food beginners to eat. I highly recommend this place to everyone. And we will be back again, when we are in town :)"}
{"text":"Decided to try a new spot after some needed shopping. On a cold crisp evening, chicken noodle soup sounded perfect and the Phö Gà was. Huge and I mean HUGE bowl was served piping hot with nice serving of rice noodles. Side serving of spring rolls, also served hot, crispy and perfect. 

My wife had the same and says \"ditto\" to this review. Try it when on the Eastside, and we will be back again.

PS. If they have their coconut ice cream...do not hesitate...order it! Homemade and can really taste the coconut. Served on a thin waffle with a side serving of peanuts! Perfect ending."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location since the day they opened. Their food is consistent in flavor. On their opening day, their service was not very good, as it took a long time to get our food. Every since then, their service has been much better!  They are always very friendly and even remember their regular customers by name! Their pho is different compared to other locations; it has more of an herbal flavor rather than meaty flavor. But it is still delicious and light. They give nice portions, and you should definitely get full from one bowl. It would be nice if they would start offering a small bowl, but I don't mind the leftovers ;)
Their pho is not the cheapest compared to AsiaTown ($10 for the deluxe pho with everything in it!), but it one of few Vietnamese options in the suburbs, so it's worth saving on gas. It helps that I don't work too far away.
I have not tried much else here because I refuse to order the com rice dishes anywhere if it does not come with the steamed egg patty (I guess I have been spoiled with the authentic stuff lol).  They do have a good taro dessert there that is definitely enough to share!
I will be back again!"}
{"text":"What a find! Outstanding food, vegan-friendly menu, efficient service with a smile, clean and attractive decor. But the real kicker is, all this quality comes at truly reasonable prices. One minor quibble: when the place is packed (as it was on a recent Thursday at lunchtime), there's little privacy, with tables placed closely together. But this place is a new favorite."}
{"text":"Pho s sweet compared to superior phone and pho ha Nam,but not bad for south east side of town.Service was great."}
{"text":"We always enjoy coming in. The food is great and the service is pretty good. Whenever I'm on this side of town I make it a point to stop by. Definitely worth trying it out."}
{"text":"For Pho in Ohio, this place is great! However, I'm used to large Vietnamese communities and the food they produce, so I'm forced to think about it from that perspective as well. 

But the reality is: there is nothing bad about this place, it is perfectly average, and in that it is amazing.

I got a bowl of pho with eye round and I asked that they add some shrimp to my bowl as well. It came out a short while later and the serving size was enormous. They definitely get points for that! The meat was all pretty rare and cooked in the broth (what I asked for), which was very yummy. The only thing that annoyed me about it was that the portion of noodles I got was smaller then I would have hoped. But realistically, it would have been hard for me to eat all of it even if there had been more, so I guess it's not a huge deal.

The broth here is pretty good. Not oily, very flavorful. It was a bit on the salty side though and the broth was murkier than I remember them being. However, it did not taste bad at all.

Side note: I forgot to ask, but there *might* (keyword) be a possibility that the broth has MSG in it. If you have reactions, you should ask because the broth tasted like it was possible that there was some in it."}
{"text":"Based on the lackluster reviews here and the restaurant's unassuming exterior, my expectations for my first visit to Bowl of Pho were modest - but don't be fooled! What we have here, friends, is a totally solid Vietnamese haunt right here in the Eastern suburbs!

Between myself and two friends, we ordered a Vietnamese coffee, lettuce wraps, a beef pho, the lemongrass chicken, and a noodle bowl with chicken. Everything was absolutely fresh, flavorful, and light.

The service was perfectly lovely and the restaurant itself is comfortable and well-appointed. I will certainly be returning!"}
{"text":"I know this is a small family owned business, so I was reluctant to provide this low of a review. However, I have been there several times, and one server in particular is extremely rude. He is a short dude with plastic rimmed glasses and spiked up hair. I don't know his name, but here are some examples of what he has said or done:
1) Starts taking away your food and wiping your table without asking you if you're done and there is visibly still food on the plate in an attempt to get you to pay your bill. Mind you, I am one of those ideal diners who is considerate when others are waiting and will eat my meal reasonably fast.  I know they are trying to get people in and out.
2) Throws sometimes subtle, sometimes not so subtle attitude at you.
3) Disciplined my brother (who has special needs) for occasionally kicking the bottom of the bench.

Food is decent, but because of this one server, I will not be visiting this restaurant again.  I pay good money to have a decent dining experience, not to have some stranger throw attitude at me and my family.   I hope the owners read this review and take into consideration that your employee needs some lessons on how to interact with other human beings."}
{"text":"Really tasty and delicious food. The pho is great and so are the vermicelli bowls. Sometimes they get very busy and are understaffed. Take out is a great option as well as dining in."}
{"text":"Always a favorite! Orlando and Leo are great! We come all the time closes pho near us and it's really good. Great on a cold night after work! Stop by anytime and try the bubble tea!"}
{"text":"Amazing pho.  I find myself craving their huge bowl of rich steaming broth filled with noodles, tofu and veggies.   The Thai iced tea is always good.   This place is always packed with happy customers and the staff is charmingly sweet. 
Really love this place!"}
{"text":"Bhan mi grilled and warm. Bigger than I'm used to and the toasted bread added a nice touch.  I couldn't use the metal chopsticks they have available. Must be for chop stizzle level users. The Pho ban biet was actually surprisingly good. Had some exotic meats up in there with some tripe to boot. Authentic, no fusion going on here.  The decor was the nicest Vietnamese restaurant I've experienced. I'm used to hole in the wall, looks like they just set up shop in a random space, type 'Nam diner. Service was quick and friendly for lunch. Give this place a try if you are in Beachwood."}
{"text":"I would say this Pho place is a little bit \"Americanized\". It's not a bad thing, but not traditional pho. The food was delicious however. The chicken pho was basically chicken noodle soup. If you want some simple food, that's light, and perfect for a cold night, this place is where you should go."}
{"text":":: VEGETARIAN REVIEW ::

First of all, kudos to this restaurant to even have vegetarian dishes.. and then to have vegetarian pho as a choice is AMAZING! I'm no pho expert, but I would have to say that I've probably been to over 100 different pho restaurants (in my meat eating days), and I have tasted 10-20 vegetarian pho dishes in Los Angeles. I would have to say that their veggie broth would be in my Top 3. My BF also loves that they have brown rice available. 

The ambiance is refreshing, and the servers are warm and friendly. Yes, they are on the pricey side for Vietnamese food.. But if you live in the east side, saving the trek toward downtown is worth it especially when the weather is bad and you need that hot bowl of soup. Also, the restaurants in this area are all pricey anyway so really, what is a better choice when you need your Asian food fix?"}
