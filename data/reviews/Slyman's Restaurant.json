{"text":"I was introduced to Slymans about 18 months ago, and I'm a better person for it.  Okay, maybe that's exaggerating a bit, but I can't think of any place I know in the US, that I'd rather go to for corned beef.

They bill themselves as the \"biggest corned beef sandwich in Cleveland,\" but they're being modest, because it's not just big, it's delicious.  

From about 11 a.m. until the close at 2:30 p.m. they have someone behind the counter doing nothing by manning the deli slicer, because they're pumping out sandwich after sandwich and it's all freshly sliced.  Be warned, they are packed at lunch time, and service can be a little slow at the rush, but not frustratingly so.

I really like their rueben, and one half of the sandwich is enough to satisfy me and give me a snack for later or lunch the next day.  I have actually eaten an entire Slyman's sandwich, but I regretted it because I was too full for the rest of the day.  And mind you, I'm not one of those waifish types who eats three bites and stops.  I like to clean a plate, but it's not advisable here. 

I have also been there for breakfast, which is good, inexpensive and fast.  The staff have been there forever it seems, and it's still family owned and operated.  This is the kind of place where the same people have been going there for decades, so it's not unusual for people to come in and get greeted by name.  But even if you're not a regular, the staff are chatty and jocular, and unless you're a vegetarian, I think you'll really like it.  I know I will keep going back."}
{"text":"Best corned-beef and Best service! Love this place and all the people that work their! Worth the wait no matter how long. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Finally had a weekday off where I could make my way down to Slyman's to try what I've heard to be the best corned beef in Cleveland.  When I pulled up there was that line out the door I'd read about, and I sidled up to the end to wait my turn.  I was getting takeout and had heard from others on Yelp that the line out the door is for folks wanting to grab it and go.  I stood in that line for about 10 minutes before making it inside, and realized that the line was actually for those wanting to get a seat and the takeout line was completely empty.  Sorta annoying, but whatever, I had the time.  While waiting for my corned beef sandwich to get made, I got to observe the ribbing between the guys working there and it looked like they were having a good time.

  Took my samich home and was pumped to dig in.  It looked mighty good and my first bite confirmed the obvious - Slyman's has some damn good corned beef!  A little saltier than other corned beef I've had, but of course that didn't slow me down.  However, while Slyman's is very good and technically the best corned beef I've had, it's not exceptionally better than a place like Corky & Lenny's which is nearer to me.  Their location and limited hours keep me from calling it a 'must have', but if I'm closer to downtown during a weekday lunch, would definitely head that way."}
{"text":"Cleveland is arguably the corned-beef capital of the world (most deli fanatics in New York and LA prefer pastrami), and Slyman's is arguably the best in the city. The review reflects three factors:

***** (five stars) for the food
**** (four stars) for the prices
*** (three stars) for atmosphere and logistics

The corned-beef is genuinely excellent. It's exceptionally lean (for brisket) and wonderfully seasoned. It'd great in sandwiches, but it's even better in an omelet. (The hash isn't wonderful, because frying damages the delicate taste).

If you order a sandwich, they stack 11 ounces (I asked) on a soft rye (both bread and crust) , whose seeds won't get stuck in your teeth. The Swiss cheese is good, but not OH MY GOD. The mustard selection is appalling (Yellow and Guldens). 

The Reuben is worth trying, because Slyman's doesn't make sauerkraut that's got the harsh, nasty taste. I don't like sauerkraut and I sometimes get it. 

I've gone there with friends who don't like corned beef and have tried the turkey, roast beef and tuna salad. They're perfectly good, but nobody would be doing TV shows about them.  French fries, cole slaw and potato salad are OK. I don't like the pickles; I love the horseradish (but it makes your eyes water).

It's impossible to eat the sandwich-- your mouth won't open that wide-- so most people pull half the sandwich off and eat it with a fork. You can do that, but a better idea is to order a \"grill brick\"-- two slices of grilled bread for a buck. Put the surplus on the grilled bread-- presto, two sandwiches.

Prices aren't so wonderful. Since the recommended portion of meat is 4 oz per meal, you can argue that you're getting three meals. If you sit down and order a soda and a side, you're still talking close to $20 for a diner lunch (with one very good ingredient).

And you have to sit down if you don't want to wait an hour. The carry-out line is out the door and around the corner by 10:30 AM and it stays that way. You can order ahead by phone or fax, but that won't guarantee the order will be ready (and once they did forget).

Best way to do this is to skip breakfast so your stomach is ready to eat at 10:30. Get there before 11 AM and sit at a table or the counter. (No waiting at that time, but by 11:30, they'll be jammed.) 

Tables are crammed in there as tight as they can be. Services is friendly, but in a real hurry. They are very good about placing orders-- sandwiches for people who didn't come or meat, cheese, bread and pickles in bulk.  And they're only open from 6:30 to 2:30 weekdays (or until the corned beef runs out); they have a Saturday morning service for sandwiches only. 

So that's why four stars and not five-- I'm not (as most other people do) cutting mulligans for the other two components. Definitely a place to experience, and the corned beef is fabulous. But the corned beef at Mr. Brisket (Cedat and Taylor in Cleveland Heights) is also very good,-- and so is Joe's on Hilliard and Wooster in Rocky River . And they let you skip many of the issues."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the hype is about, although everybody talks about the huge corned beef sandwiches. They don't offer one that the average person can eat--and afford. This place is wayyyyy overpriced for a corned beef sandwich, even if it is big, and a number of other menu items. The dining room is a dive. You would think they would put some money into it considering how much they charge. They don't take take-out orders. You have to stand in line like herded cattle."}
{"text":"I'm a huge corned beef sandwich fan - Corkys has always been my go to but this place knows what they're doing! Amazing sandwiches, great atmosphere, never would have expected such great food driving by."}
{"text":"Vegetarians need not apply.  This is a near-legendary Cleveland establishment that is open for breakfast and lunch on the weekdays, and, more recently, lunch on the weekends.  As far as the food goes, you don't really have options.  You are going to get the largest, most delicious corned beef sandwich of your life.  For an extra fifty cents they will hide a little sauerkraut under the beef and call it a reuben.  Come hungry because they pile about a pound (if not more) of corned beef on each sandwich.  You will definitely need a fork. 

There is always a crowd around lunch time and a line out the door is not unheard of.  Nonetheless, they keep things moving and this is the perfect downtown spot for an hour lunch break.  I should mention that its in an older, somewhat dilapidated building and the furniture/decor is like an 80s diner.  I am recommending Slyman's strictly for the corned beef sandwich - the restaurant itself is not very attractive."}
{"text":"I'd give Slyman's 10 stars if I could. The corned beef is amazing, the rye bread is quality (too often places slack on this), the cole slaw is delicious, there are tubs of eye-watering horseradish on every table, and the waitresses...Oh, the waitresses. They're the diner angles of your dreams. You'll be fed well and quickly, and while you're enjoying your meal you can also enjoy some good people-watching. It's a great cross-section of Cleveland life."}
{"text":"The claim to have the biggest and best corned beef sandwhiches in Cleveland and the live up to that claim!

Their corned beef sandwhiches are the best that I have ever tasted, and I have tried a lot of other places in cities all over the country!

The seating is limited, so if you go there for lunch get there before the lunch rush that comes in around 11 - 11:30 AM. Also the close early in the afternoon, so don't wait long. If you are in a hurry, call your order in ahead of time or fax it in.

Every year they sell out of corned beef on St. Patrick's Day, so call your order in ahead of time or go before or after the holiday.

Parking can be a challenge, so be patient, it is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Still the best corned beef sandwiches in town. Worth every penny. I've had corned beef many other places, but none compare to Slymans."}
{"text":"The best corned beef I have ever eaten, and also the best roast beef. I've been eating here for about 15 years. The portions are huge. Can't say enough good about their deli foods."}
{"text":"It's a $15 sandwich. That part up front. Secondly it's a $15 sandwich which you know exactly what you will get, a pile of freshly cut meat on some of the best rye bread ever. Keep the meal simple, order a staple, corned beef, roast beef Reuben, a pickle and you will not be disappointed. Don't skip the pickle."}
{"text":"My 4 stars is for Slyman's corned beef sandwich - it was huge and amazing and hugely amazing. I had mine to go with Swiss cheese, mustard and horseradish. I barely had to chew the corned beef, it's like it melted in my mouth. Delicious and probably the best thing I ate in Cleveland...well, that and the Polish Boy."}
{"text":"This is the best corn beef in Cleveland.  I know what you are thinking... what about Jack's or Corky's?  Nope.  If you like succulent, juicy and tasty corn beef this is your place.  IF you like a rueben this is the best it's done on a griddle so the bread is crispy and soft.  Jack's puts their rueben on a panini press and they are hard and crunchy (not so good).  Corky's corn beef is not so succulent.  

The staff is excellent.  I just love the simple atmosphere too.  Nothing fussy.  This is the ultimate diner.  The sandwiches are so big you can definitely share one or take half home for later.  Order a simple and inexpensive breakfast- two eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast and it will arrive with a mound of bacon.  Not sure how they can get away with charging so little for all of this food.  Great place!"}
{"text":"This is the best corned beef I've had.  Over the past 25 years...at least...I have gotten corned beef sandwiches from here...and they have always been consistent with the taste and portion.  I finally dined in on Saturday morning because the dining room was almost empty...but it filled up by the time we left!  The staff and cooks were all very nice and thanked us for coming when we left!!"}
{"text":"Love the corn beef sandwiches. I just  don't like that the prices keep going up on the corn beef sandwiches. 14.95 ."}
{"text":"Great deli lunch spot if you like nice big fat greasy hot meaty sandwiches (I do!).  (If you are looking for vegetarian food or a lot of \"healthy options\" you need to go somewhere else.)  Slyman's is the real deal, been around for many years, patronized mostly by locals and refreshingly devoid of tourists, foodies and any sort of trendy hipster atmosphere.  Although renowned for their corned beef, other stuff like your basic hot ham and cheese, pastrami, etc.  are also excellent.  They have a reasonably sized menu of things that they do well, as opposed to a humongous menu 3/4 of which is mediocre. 

Sandwiches are fat enough for 2-3 meals if you're a smaller person, and are 80 percent very tasty fresh meat (i had to hunt around for the kraut and dressing on my Reuben).  No microwave in evidence here, it's all grilled, the way it should be.  Expect a little wait if you want to \"dine in\" for lunch especially, as it's very popular and crowded, but the take-out orders are fulfilled very quickly.  They also give you very good extra bread and pickles with the take-out, the better to create a few extra sandwiches out of your gargantuan main order.  Condiments are pretty basic (request for mustard will get you plastic packs of yellow stuff) but the meat tastes so good you probably don't want to cover it up with condiments anyway.

Another plus of this place:  ample free street parking and very convenient to both the Shoreway and I-90, so it's easy in/out.  Not sure why some of the other reviews are nervous about this neighborhood - it's certainly a lot better than it used to be, and besides the restaurant operates during broad daylight ( closes at 2:30 pm) and has lots of people coming and going outside during lunch hour."}
{"text":"Unreal Corned Beef. Sandwiches are enormous and the staff is friendly. Get there early if you are going for lunch, or you will wait in line. Well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Frankly, You need to look for something on your plate or your box that's actually healthy for you.

 The fact that your only have meat on your plate (and no balance between your nutrition) is somewhat disturbing. 

Just because this grandfathered whole in the wall place does exist does not make justice to the people who really started this place with a warm heart and feeling. 

Now this place rest's on his reputation earned by the ancestors that fought hard for this being a place to come to. 

I can not and will not settle for an overstuffed piece of shit sandwich with more meat one can swallow to make it to even \"ONE\" * on my books.

 If you are local and need to impress somebody, take them to Subway. 
Their food still sucks too, but at least you know it.  

The closing statement is ;  \"Just because you smoother customers with to much food does not make you stand out of the crowd in taste of what you serve.\"

I personally won't be back again ever. 

Good luck."}
{"text":"Just went here for the corn beef and I was not dissappointed.  I dined in because I walked from downtown.  I took thr other half because it was a lot of food and I had to get back for a conference.  Everyone was nice and thr server was to thr point and gave me some tips since that all I was there for.  I dont eat corn beef but this was worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! We had a corned beef sandwich and then took home some of their corned beef hash. All I can say is wow!  It is a bit of a drive for us, but we will have to make this a regular trip."}
{"text":"For real the best corned beef and pastrami sandwiches you can get. If you're going during lunch hour you should be prepared for a crowd and to wait in line for 15-20 minutes, but it's totally worth it"}
{"text":"Step 1. Two slices of rye bread. 
Step 2. Lather it with so much butter that you might as well have eaten butter flavored with bread.
Step 3. Stuff too much meat (it's not organic, so it's loaded with nitrates, hormones and antibiotics. That's why it's cheap as hec) into  it.
Step 4: This is the \"famous sandwich\"??

I know this fare isn't meant to be vegan or healthy. But for all the crap you're putting in your body eating here, the 'food' might as well have been tasty, yes (think McD fries)?

 Let's call this place \"Slyman - Walmart Style Food\"."}
{"text":"you definitely will not leave hungry.  GREAT corned beef sandwich! Great old school dinner vibe. i will be back whenever i am close to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Amazing corned beef sandwiches! These are the biggest and tastiest corned beef sandwiches ive ever had. The service is excellent. Depending on the time of day, you may have to stand in a long line, but its worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is for anyone traveling through, I cannot speak for locals. To summarize, if you are a fan of a local feel restaurant with excellent specialty sandwiches this is your place! I would suggest stopping here even if you're passing through-it's a quick stop just off I-90. Full details below. 

Ambiance: when you pull up to park you might question your decision, neighborhood feels a little rough, but don't let that keep you from going inside! Inside it's not a very big place, if you show up while it's busy, no worries, people eat surprisingly quick here. They have a sign telling you whether you need to wait to be seated or not-and the waitresses are quick to get to you. If you're just picking up-they've got a line at the counter for you that goes quickly as well. It can be loud if full and you'll be close to the tables next to you, not sure that I would bring toddlers with me-but you can get food to go. It feels like a legendary, family owned hole-in-the-wall type place. The staff feel as though they've been working there a while and know what they're doing. 

Ordering: If dining in, you'll order from menus at your table.  Prices are over $10 for most sandwiches, but you can easily split a sandwich and each get a side and it would be plenty of food. Your waitress will give you a check and you'll pay at the cash register-they do take cards and if you ask to add in tip, they'll run your card and then give you the cash amount to leave on the table.

Service was quick and helpful without making you feel rushed. Our waitress helped my husband order their most well known sandwich and she quickly filled our drinks when they were low. We never felt harassed or abandoned. 
Food: Our order came out in a matter of minutes, hot and fresh! I ordered the grilled cheese-American on white that came with a giant dill pickle spear-grilled cheese was a perfect American grilled cheese. I also ordered crinkle fries, nothing fancy, no seasoning, just classic fries. My husband ordered the corned beef sandwich with swiss on rye which also came with a pickle spear. He was overly impressed with the taste and nearly made it 3/4 of the way through-we'd never seen such a massive sandwich. There was horse radish on the table along with basic condements and the waitress dropped off thousand island dressing to accompany my husbands sandwich as well.

Bathroom: old-single bathroom-might have to wait if there's a line. Kept fairly clean for how busy they were. 

If ever in the area, we will make a point to come here again! 

From my husband: Location felt suspect-sorry locals-but was comforted by the overall look of the place. Wait staff was very helpful. Corned beef sandwich was amazing."}
{"text":"Horrible experience due to the extreme rudeness of the blonde server behind the take-out counter. First, she gave out the wrong order, then after I had to go back to pick up the right one she rudely scolded me for returning so late. Unbelievable behavior. Strong Slovak or similar accent. Will never return."}
{"text":"worked with all-male crew last night. it was fun as it reminded me of home: growing up with 3 brothers and my dad.:) the fun extended until breakfast too!:)

we all drove to Slyman's a little sleepy but starving. one of my co-worker was hyping on how good the corned beef sandwich is in here, so, to cap our night we all agreed to try it!:)

my \"homies\" (lol!) got the corned beef sandwiches in different breads and with different kinds of cheese and I got the corned beef hash with eggs. i think we were a little loud going in there but as soon as the food arrived, nobody said a word for a while.. i saw nodding and i heard \"hhmmmm's\" and \"aaahh's.\" 

the corned beef hash is the BEST that i've had so far.. i loved the browning of the potatoes and the texture and sound it creates as i take a bite.. it taste soooo homemade too!!:) the onions gave it a dimension i never found on other hash that i've had.:) 

my co-workers loved what they had and said that we should go there more often.:) As for me, I'll bring my girlfriends for sure!:) this place really is worth bragging specially when you're surrounded by corned beef lovers.:)"}
{"text":"We visited Slyman's for a late breakfast after the Tackle the Tower Stair Climb Race, Downtown.  I have had Slyman's before, but never for breakfast, and only for carryout.

If you go during the week, during lunch hours, expect a wait.  However, at 10:00 on a Saturday, we got a table right away.

Our waitress was attentive and very personable, refilling coffee and my hot water for tea.  The food came out quickly, and it was HOT (temperature hot).  My fiancé and I ordered the same thing - Corned Beef Hash with 2 Basted eggs and toast.  The eggs came out perfectly. The hash was a nice mix of corned beef, potatoes and onions.  

The décor is very casual, with lots of pictures of the Three Stooges doing various antics, and restaurant reviews from newspapers and magazines.  They have been written up a lot for their mile-high Corned Beef Sandwiches/Reubens.

This is a real deli, with someone manning the meat slicer, and a chef cooking over the griddle.  Slyman's is a Cleveland institution and a must visit when you're in town.  The prices are a little on the high side, but you get a ton of food for the money.  We both took home leftovers and had them for breakfast the next day."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is one of Cleveland's best gems!  I will never forget the first time my parents took me to Slyman's as a little girl - the experience was life changing!  Why, you ask??  Because I would eat one of the best sandwiches EVER for the first time!  I have since become a HUGE fan and look forward to the days when I can get my hands on one of these monsters!

Be advised that this place gets packed (and I mean PACKED!) for lunch - many times the line is out the door (hey, it's that good!)  You'll be happy you waited once your order comes up - trust me.  Definitely know what you want when you get up there - they like to keep the pace moving.  I LOVE LOVE LOVEEE the corned beef sandwiches.  You don't need to put much on it (I like mine with just mustard and TONS of horseradish) and I always ask for 2 extra slices of bread to make a second sandwich out of the one I just ordered (it's A LOT of meat!).  I've also had the hot turkey dinner, which was also awesome.  Lastly, don't forget to order the fries - I always ask for some gravy on the side to dip 'em in (DELICIOUSNESS!).

By far the best deli I've ever been to.  If it's good enough for a former President, then it's good enough for me! 

P.S. Check the hours before you go - they open really early (heard the breakfasts are incredible), which also means they close early.  Don't expect to pick up dinner here."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! And just what they advertise, awesome GIGANTIC sandwiches. I got a traditional corned beef and could only finish half but was super stoked to take the other half home to eat later. We came around lunch time with a party of 5 and still managed to get seated. 

I guess the price is kind of steep for just a sandwich but it is really very tasty."}
{"text":"Got there at the beginning of lunch, and service was super fast, but very polite. We got ours to go, and they gave us extra bread. It was a nice touch, cause there was clearly enough meat on here to feed a small army.

Definitely one of the better Rubens I've ever had. I took off half the meat and saved it for a second sandwich. That brought the ratios into the right order. Otherwise, the cheese and sauce gets lost in the mix. My friend got the corned beef sandwich, which without any of the extras is very dry. 

Darn good stuff."}
{"text":"By far the greatest place to get a corn beef sandwich in all of Ohio. Their sandwiches are on some next level! And I mean some truly next level! You haven't lived till you've tried one of these! Nothing and I mean NOTHING can even come close! The service is always great, the waitresses are always very personable, which I like. You can really sit down and relax, and just take in the atmosphere of the place. Their food is great, whether you are getting their breakfast or their legendary corn beef sandwich, you won't be disappointed. This little joint truly encompasses the spirit of Cleveland. This place is a true Cleveland landmark."}
{"text":"One of the most over-rated joints on Earth, although if what you want is to stand in line for a humongous pile of mediocre food, wet, floppy french fries with bland gravy, and surly service for an inexpensive price, this is your place. I really apologize for not agreeing with the others. Maybe I went there on an off day."}
{"text":"Put simply, Slyman's is quite possibly the best deli value on the planet earth. While Slyman's may seem expensive by Cleveland standards, let me assure you that it charges a mere fraction of the cost of similar delis in places like New York City. Slyman's is more than just great food. It is also special because of the family ownership! I once stood in line behind a guy who ordered thirty sandwiches and they informed him that for an order that size, it should be phoned in the future. They apologized to me for having to wait and they gave me a free ice tea at the register. As I returned in the future, through that mob that is their daily lunch line, the guy that makes the sandwiches remembered that I wanted a \"lean corned beef (a \"natural\" in Slyman speak) hold the pickle.\" It didn't matter if I had been there four times that week or I hadn't been there in over a month, he always remembered. With all the people he sees and special requests he receives daily he somehow remembered the incident and displayed consistent and sincere appreciation for my forgiveness and patronage. It is a great lesson in how to run a business the right way. Focus on what your customer wants, give them consistent value the way your customer wants it and show sincere appreciation for their business. Many businesses today could learn much from this simple, yet customer-focused philosophy.

{"text":"What an experience. My friend and I waited outside in line for a good 20 minutes before getting in the door. And this was for carry out! But WOW was it worth it! The pastrami sandwiches are HUGE and fantastic! Served with a pickle, one sandwich was enough for my lunch and dinner! 
This is also quit the celeb attraction. The walls are lined with famous guests and Rachel Ray even featured the establishment on $40 a day, or one of her shows like that!
We missed the governor by 5 minutes... wow it was great!!!!!"}

{"text":"Awesome. Went for first time this St. Pattys day. stood in line for 40 mins & once I got inside the staff was so friendly even though this was 2:30 and they had been busting ass all day. Loaded sandwiches, can't wait to go back ."}
{"text":"Very good corned beef, although my sandwich was not stacked nearly as high as generally depicted in photos. Only 2 stars due to high prices, and an incredibly rude staff. Not terse and abrupt because they're busy, but snarky and condescending, as though they are doing you some great favor by making you a sandwich. It seems customers are an annoyance. I likely won't be back. There are plenty of other great sandwich places in Cleveland."}
{"text":"What more could I say? Their food is exceptional deli fare, with the Ruben being top notch. The corned beef is fantastic. Whichever sandwich you get, it's wise to get extra bread as the amount of meat is enough to make 3-4 decent sized sandwiches."}
{"text":"I was not impressed by Slyman's corned beef.  Yes, the sandwich was huge--one of the biggest in town--but it the corned beef was completely DRY.  I know some people will disagree, but to me, the perfect corned beef is hot and moist--tastes good and feels good.  Unfortunately, this sandwich was not."}
{"text":"Didn't think I liked corned beef until I had a Slyman's sandwich. Fantastic! Portions are massive in the best way possible. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Best coened beef sandwich in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Very reminiscent of some of the older New York delis... small, noisy and very vibrant.
Even the best corned beef has a tendency to dry out, but not at Slyman's. It was very moist. The cole slaw was a perfect texture for adding to the sandwich. Pickles... delicious. One negative... their highly touted potato pancakes, in our opinion did not make the grade. The nice soft inside was fine, but the crusty outside just didn't make it in appearance or taste."}
{"text":"I was tempted to go here because Rachael Ray went there on \"$40 a Day\". It's a little off the beaten path in a more residental neighboorhood. When you go inside it makes you think of a New York deli. The thing to have here is their corned beef sandwich and it was good. By far the corned beef here, is just as good as the kind in New York and it's a lot cheaper. A sandwich here costs something like $8, and it's totally worth it. If in Cleveland again, I'll most likely come back for another sandwich."}

{"text":"I never much liked corned beer before I first went to Slyman's. I still don't much like it from any other place. 
To say that Slyman's has the best corned beef in Cleveland is the greatest understatement you could make. 

It is absolutely fantastic. The staff is terrific and the food is phenomenal. There is a reason why the line is often out the door."}
{"text":"I came home to visit from Nashville, TN.  The owner was greatful when I told him I stop everytime I come home.

{"text":"The best corned beef in town."}
{"text":"As most of the reviewers agree, Slyman's is known for their corned beef and it is terrific.  I am a native New Yorker and agree that Slyman's offers up some of the best corned beef!!!  We have had breakfast, lunch, and take out from Slyman's over the years, during our visits to Cleveland.  It is usually our last stop on the way out of town for breakfast and take out sandwiches.  Corned beef as a side for breakfast and then corned beef, roast beef, and pastrami sandwiches for the ride home.  Slyman's is a deli with a restaurant.  Nothing fancy, it's clean and the food and service are outstanding.  All I have to say is if you are in Cleveland, want a really good sandwich, and want to taste a local deli, it is the place to go.  You will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My first positive review in many has to be a 5er for the finest corned beef I've ever eaten, and that includes you New York City, quit resting on your reputation Yankee tossers. 

They could charge double for this sandwich, and I'd still pay it, be happy to pay it, stand in line for 30 minutes looking at the endless Three Stooges paraphernalia to pay it, let the waitress constantly bump my chair with her ass to pay it, share a table with sweaty strangers to pay it, wait outside for a seat in the middle of winter to pay it, then I'd still have half of it for leftovers. 

Haters can suck it. There isn't anything more Cleveland than Slyman's. Not one thing. (and I bet all the bad reviews are from Jewish New Yorkers cheesed off that a Lebanese Clevelander PWNS their shit)."}

Actually it's been forever.  I came here for lunch with a coworker and was surprised.  This place is not in a well traveled area (we were working at a nearby industrial facility), yet is packed to the gills.

I see why after eating the sandwich.  The service is OK, the restaurant is in OK condition, the drinks are OK, the packed tiny dining room room is OK, but the damn sandwich makes it all magical.  Corned beef stacked higher than anyone ever dared to stares you in the face at the counter beckoning you to eat it.  My sandwich was huge, the size of a small chihuahua, and I ate every last bite.  It not only was huge, but it tasted amazing.  The ingredients on their own are all delicious and seemed to me very fresh.  

Slyman's knows how to make an amazing sandwich.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best! Have to stop here once a week for a corned beef sandwich!!! I have only been to the St Clair location but I'm sure they are all fantastic. Can't say enough good things about this place. Old school food served up the RIGHT way."}
{"text":"I had the pastrami sandwich and it was phenomenal. FULL of flavor and smothered in your choice of cheese and other condiments  (I had horseradish).

I was a little sticker shocked at first, as my sandwich alone was listed at $14, but after I realized how giant the sandwich was I understood the price. I recommend going with a friend and splitting a sandwich as one is more than enough for 2 people."}
{"text":"July 2015 saw me back in the Cleveland area and I HAD to visit Slyman's, but this time on the way to the airport. HA HA!! I bought 3 pounds of corned beef and brought it back to SF in my carry on bag.  Oh, the scent must have driven the other passengers crazy, but too bad I was not sharing any of my Slyman's."}
{"text":"I haven't been able to find a good corned beef sandwich since I moved away from Cleveland six years ago.  Slyman's makes my favorite corned beef.  The sandwiches are huge and priced the same as restaurants in other other parts of the country charge for a sandwich half the size made from inferior corned beef.  Everytime I visit home, I go to Slymans."}
{"text":"It only took me 27 years to finally decide to eat at Slyman's. Not sure what I was waiting for. My seldom exposure to anything corned beef and lack thereof of any craving? My skeptic thoughts on rye bread? The concept of sauerkraut, corned beef, swiss cheese, and rye? The infamous, neverending line out the door of die-hard Slyman's fans? Fuck it, today was the day to go, and I'm glad I did.

Rolled in just after 11:15 or so, and was guided to an open table. We already decided before hand it would be best to share. The galpal never had corned beef, nor sauerkraut, but if that's you and need some exposure then damn it Slyman's is a required start.b

Got a Reuben as is, fries, potato salad. Less than 5 minutes everything was hot, fresh, and ready to eat. Everything was fucking great. Just amazing corned beef. Great Reuben just as it is, great with mustard, great with the dressing.

We came in at the perfect time, because not long after the tables filled and lines started forming. It was impressive watching everything unfold and our server bouncing around from table to table taking care o everyone and refilling drinks any chance she got. They do NOT fuck around here, and I appreciated that. Definitely coming back soon."}
{"text":"Best corned beef sandwich in NE Ohio. The corned beef melt is so awesome! Homemade potato salad rocks, too!"}
{"text":"The cornbeef was huge but it was dry. The service was Amazing! ! I had a overall good experience for my first time eating there. You should offer pepper jack cheese!! The Ruben just needs moisture and it would give you five stars."}
{"text":"Came in today, our server Candice was excellent and super sweet, our sandwiches were huge and tasty and we have more for dinner. We'll be back for more and hope to chat with Candice again."}
{"text":"Lots of hype about this place together with the recommendation of our host took us to Slymans. We of course ordered the Corned Beef sandwich... It was huge - I'll give them that. I was disappointed with the meat, however. It was dry and not nearly as flavorful as I expected. Maybe it was just an off day considering all of the great reviews they have. I hope so."}
{"text":"The best corned beef sandwich you will ever eat. Simply amazing. Your plate overflows with meat, and its super lean and fresh. This is a small dive nothing to it, but packed during the lunch hour. Must try!"}
{"text":"First time at Slymans and we were so impressed. Went for a mid morning breakfast. It was amazing corned beef omelet and ham and eggs. Great service and reasonable prices. You don't want to miss this place if you are traveling through Cleveland."}
{"text":"No Better in Cleveland. The coned beef is buttery and just melts on your mouth. Not a lot of seating but if you get there a little early for lunch you may get a seat. But get there early even if you don't want a seat. There is something to be said about a place that the line goes out the door. Good food that's why!"}
{"text":"Don't see what the hype is all about, in my opinion Hanini's on Superior has better Corn beef!!!"}
{"text":"Best deli in Cleveland. Every time I go back to Cleveland I try to stop in at Slyman's. There can be a line at times and they do close a little early. Either way, it's always a lot of food and very delicious."}
{"text":"Simply the best corned beef sandwich in the Midwest.  No contest.  This place has been serving the best corned beef around for as long as I can remember.  The only place that could even compete was Goodman's on the West Side but the owner retired and closed the place.  If you have never been here, you are truly missing out on one of the best sandwiches money can buy."}
{"text":"Mm mm mm! Stopped at Slymans on a Thursday afternoon; we were pleasantly surprised when the line wasn't out the door. As usual, enjoyed the corn beef on rye and a turkey melt. They were both delicious. Do yourself a favor and skip the fries. More than likely you'll already be taking a doggy bag home."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!! EVERY single time I visit my hometown I make it a point to stop by Slymans for their amazing corned beef sandwiches. Their sandwiches are unparalleled to anyone eles, and their customer service is just as amazing, they Still remember my name when I walk in..I love & miss this place..every city needs a Slyman's!


Thanks guys.....Trish"}
{"text":"Fantastic. Get a corned beef on rye, and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"Hands down the Best Corned Beef...Freddie Slyman is the man and has a great establishment.  This is one reason why I love to be near Cleveland.  You may have a wait sometimes but its worth it!!"}
{"text":"Nora Ephron must have never made it to Cleveland.

Seems the debate between Katz's (NYC) and Langer's (LA) for best corned beef sandwich in America needs a third contestant.  Like its better known counterparts, Slymans seems a blast from the past, with yellowing formica-topped tabletops and cash-only tips for the waitstaff.

Ordered the corned beef melt (understanding that I lose Kosher authenticity points in the process) and received a softball-sized globe of shaved beef between two slices of overmatched soft rye.  Corned beef is warm, juicy, and incredible when eaten with a knife and fork.  Didn't have the courage to lift it to the face while wearing a shirt and tie.

Like Katz's, the focus is on the meat, with the bread merely serving as a delivery device.  Contrast this to Langer's, and the 2nd Avenue Deli (on 3rd Avenue, NYC), in which the focus is on the complete sandwich.  Unlike Katz's thick chunks and slices, Slyman's corned beef is sliced paper-thin and stacked, precluding more like-to-like comparisons of the corned beef itself.

Hot dog is excellent.  Fries come out of a bag.  Adequate street and lot parking available."}
{"text":"Excellent food, always a long wait. This is not an every day place more like special occasions"}
{"text":"Please. Nobody does it better. Big, fast, delicious... The hype is real. If you haven't eaten here yet what the hell is wrong with you?"}
{"text":"Love love love the food, the people and everything! Never ever a bad meal! I have been coming here for so long the staff is like my family! Sending a shout out to all my friends at Slymans!"}
{"text":"Eat in and skip the line that is guaranteed to be way out the door."}
{"text":"Being a vigilant Irishman I've been constantly searching for the best corned beef. I travel daily for my job and have tried corned beef from just about everywhere. I will pledge my allegiance to Slyman's. This place opens early for breakfast and has corned beef on the menu. A corned beef & Swiss omelette with hasbrowns is heaven in the morning. Now this sandwich that has made headlines around Ohio is worth the wait. I stress the word wait because if you happen to show up at the lunch or dinner rush their could be a line out the door. Having said that I will reassure you the wait is worth it. This sandwich is $12 but once it's cut in half it can be 2 meals it's so huge.   Best Corned Beef in Ohio, hands down."}
{"text":"\"You know what it is, everything I do, I do it big.\" -Wiz Khalifa

Ya, I just quoted a rapper. It's all about the corned beef, I want some now."}
{"text":"There were white out conditions in downtown Cleveland this weekend, but I waited it out to make sure I hit Slyman's before leaving. The sandwiches are just that good. The corn beef is the star, but both roast beef and pastrami are delicious too. Preference is always to drag someone along you can split a few of the monster sandwiches. And the plate of fries drenched in gravy is perfect complement on the side.

I've been here more than a few times, and the staff is always friendly even when the place is packed. A great balance of being personable and courteous, without going overboard. This isn't a five-start rating grading a Cleveland curve, this is definitely one of the elite places in country to grab a sandwich. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Sly Man's Sandwich

Intro:  I found this place on Yelp right out of the airport and I'm really glad I did.  Cleveland is a very American city, so sandwiches appear to be the closest thing to a signature delicacy.  Can you get more American than that.  I believe if Fred Flinstone were alive in 2015, this is where he would go for lunch, probably driving a Ford F-150 instead his feet.

Ambiance:  This is a true lunch pail place.  it has the feel of a diner.  It is definitely a place for people to go during lunch and take a break from the boss.  It's a homely feel where you can familiarize yourself with the workers.  They are very busy though.  The place was crowded when I got there, but everything moved fast.

Food:  I ordered one of the signature sandwiches, the corned beef.  When I think \"sandwich\" I'm thinking.. lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, etc.  Well, Slyman's idea of a corned beef sandwich is two pieces of bread, a slice of cheese and a hunk of sliced meat.  This is one of those places where there's no guaranteed that you'll finish the meal, but I punished mine.  I'm no corned beef expert, but it was a nice flavor and texture.  The meat was very soft and sliced to perfection.  I got it with a sandwich and chips and went to work.  I think the lady was surprised that I finished all of it.  I'm a big proponent of eating local cuisine the way it's supposed to be eaten, so I accepted the sandwich without all the fixin's.  I did add the orange sauce that was on the table (thousand island type sauce) and added that to my sandwich.

Customer service:  My waitress, the lady with salt and pepper hair was nice.  This is a busy, family owned business, so they don't really have time to be chummy.  keep in mind, this is a Midwestern, hard-hat type establishment.  

Closing:  Give it a shot!  President Bush did and he's never been wrong about anything. lol

Bonus Points:  Easy parking and they have my favorite book at the counter... the Bible!"}
{"text":"Stop by Slymans for some of the best corned beef money can buy. The Russian dressing sauce is divine, and don't miss out on the pickle. Our server was very friendly as well and gave us extra bread for no charge."}
{"text":"Awesome, fresh food.  Went for the Tuna Plate today and it was delicious! Huge serving and totally satisfying!"}
{"text":"WOW! When in Cleveland you MUST eat here!!!! Definitely a place mean't to be on TV somewhere!!! The corn beef sandwich was amazing!!! Expect to wait in line. But well worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"Still the best around!  Every time I come here, it never disappoints.  The corned beef is perfect and we love all the sides we usually get (crinkle cut fries, creamy potato salad and tangy cole slaw).  Always enough meat to bring home for extra sandwiches and maybe even a little homemade corned beef hash.

Do one thing...and do it right!"}
{"text":"Best corned beef sandwich I've ever had. Everything about it was good. It was as good as any sandwich I've had in a New York deli. The Thousand Island Dressing and Horseradish they provide are spectacular as well."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!  I loved corned beef and you can't go wrong with the HUGE portions you get here.  They have other options on the menu, but they're known for their corned beef.  They love Cleveland and Clevelanders love them.  It's one of the best \"mom & pop\" places in town.  Usually a long line for lunch, but it goes fast.  Check it out!!"}
{"text":"It's always been a place for me to recommend to friends and family the food is always spot on and I know you pay for what you get but 2 Ruebens 1 plain corn beef  and 1small side of potato salad was $51.00 to me that's a little over priced they will always get my business just not as frequent as I would like to give them"}
{"text":"This is a very good example of the old adage '' Keep it simple , stupid '' ...... Slymans long ago figured out how to make the biggest & best corned beef sandwiches.... this place runs like a finely-tuned Maserati with every employee performing their job to a synchronized perfection ( and sense of humor )....... feel bad for people outside of Cleveland who think they've had a good corned beef sandwich - this place is world class ."}
{"text":"Five stars for the corned beef! Have you ever been to the famous Carnegie Deli in New York City? I bet you were blown away by their sandwich... and their prices. If so, you have got to check out Slymans. The corned beef sandwich is of that calibre! However, the place is more chill, way better service, and the best part... half the price.
Loved this place. I hear it gets busy sometimes, but I sat right down at noon on a weekday. If you like corned beef sandwiches- you simply have to go!"}
{"text":"After eating a Corned Beef Sandwich @ Slyman\"s, everything else Blows!
If you want to piss them off ask for a lean sandwich. 
The finest in Cleveland. I don't care what anyone says, they are wrong! 
The keep slinging the best sandwiches and service year after year.

A Cleveland landmark. You will not leave hungry. If you go for lunch, get there no later than 11:30 or your waiting outside. Oh, and St. Patrick's day, you won't get within 2 blocks of this place. Everything is great, but the Corned Beef and Eggs or the sandwich is what keeps them coming back!"}
{"text":"This sandwich was a celebration-of food, of acing a major audition, of being with my fiance on a warm, sunny morning. Not to mention, it was a party of flavorful, perfectly seasoned, succulent corned beef.

Sweetening my memory was the impression left on my tastebuds that fine April morning...the perfect sandwich. I never doubted my fiance's love of this establishment, but I couldn't understand his ardor for their corned beef until I had my first taste.

It was a defining moment in my culinary life, after which no sandwich could hope to compare. They are only open for lunch, so make a special trip. If you haven't had a Slyman's sandwich, can you really call yourself a Clevelander? I don't believe you can."}
{"text":"Slyman's is the A-1 best corned beef in Cleveland. Juicy, tasty, right off the slicer. Stand in line and get a Smurf (w/ swiss and mustard on rye). You will turn blue if you try to eat the whole thing. I usually do half and my wife gets the rest. The next person that tells me some bullcrap about \"So and so's is owned by the same family and has the same corned beef,\" should get a smack in the face. There is only one."}
{"text":"This is one of the places you must try if you are visiting Cleveland. Most locals already know about it and highly recommend it. I usually don't rate corned beef sandwiches very high but I had never had one in Cleveland before.

I had a Corned Beef Reuben and it was fantastic! Served on toasted rye with some Stadium Mustard and I was in sandwich heaven. By far the best corned beef sandwich I have ever had. Bring an appetite as the sandwiches here are enormous.

Even if it's crowded and you have to wait, it's worth it. I couldn't leave Cleveland having had only one."}
{"text":"Straight-up authentic deli.  This is a no-frills, let-the-food-speak-for-itself no-apologies-needed place.  It was jammed during lunch.  I was short on time so I got my order to go.  I'm not really a corned beef fan, so I settled on the turkey melt with swiss, horseradish, and mustard.  The sandwich comes with a large, deli-style pickle.  Score!  Add a Diet Coke and the total tab was $10.  Not bad.  My turkey melt was the largest sandwich I've seen in a long time.  I bet that sandwich was at least 5\" high.  It was perfectly grilled and oozing with cheese, too.  SO YUMMY.  This place runs like a New York deli in terms of speed of service but the people who work there are really friendly.  Good stuff.  And one more thing...make sure you drive a shitty car to this place.  St. Clair Ave is nothing but potholes!  yowch."}
{"text":"I was the last customer of the day and I am so grateful. Easily the best corn beef I've ever had, and maybe the best sandwich of any type I've ever eaten.

Thanks for cleaning off the griddle one more time today for me. You have a fan for life, and I will be speaking of miss sandwich for years to come."}
{"text":"A staple in the Cleveland lunch scene. Slymans  is known for their breakfast, roast beef sandwiches, pastrami sandwiches and the most popular corn beef. It's an old-school diner feel on the inside. Family owned and ran they are behind the counter working and cutting the meat fresh. The time is speedy and the staff is friendly. Prices are a little steep but it's all about supply and demand... I must try if you are a Clevelander or visiting"}
{"text":"I am not sue I can really add much other then to say it is worth the trip.  The staff is really nice and will engage with you if you are up for it.  The food in awesome.  The place is divvy, but I would not have it any other way.  

The parking is a little tough as is the neighborhood.  That is really the only down side."}
{"text":"Just tried Slyman's today for the first time at lunch.  I work less than a mile away and have really been wanting to try it.  It did not disappoint!

If you only have an hour for lunch, like me, this place will not disappoint!  We were nervous we wouldn't have enough time since we heard it gets back during lunch, but the service was insanely fast and everyone was very friendly.

I got the corned beef sandwich and my co-worker got the turkey.  Both were delicious!  Be sure to tell the cashier you want to leave a tip if paying by credit card."}
{"text":"There is nothing that my review will add to the 292 other reviews already written for Slyman's, except for me to say that if you are in Cleveland, you have to go. Sure the neighborhood is a little sketchy, sure it isn't as fancy as you may want it to be, but damn the corned beef sandwich is delicious (and one order is big enough for 2 people), and the people who work there are super friendly.

Go now, and let me know how you enjoyed the Ballpark mustard."}
{"text":"Hands down the best hot corned beef sandwich I've ever had. The hubby and I discovered Slyman's when we were truckin'. We've been to alot of places and there is none better than Slyman's. And after you're full you can go to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."}
{"text":"Legendary sandwiches with a distinctive  Cleveland taste.  My dad Introduced me to corned beef at Slyman's and mothering has ever measure up since.  One of those Cleveland traditions You crave when you move away.  Careful not to unhinge your jaw trying take a bite."}
{"text":"This is the BEST corned beef sandwich we've ever had!

The funny thing about Slyman's is that we heard about it, almost every week, long before we ever moved here.  A former Cleveland native would RAVE about it every single time we saw him - how small the place is, how good the meat is, how it's ALWAYS packed.  This should seriously go nationwide!

The sandwich is the biggest thing you'll ever try to wrap your mouth around.  It is is juicy and flavorful and my stomach is growling at me now as I write this.  The rye is soft and perfectly toasted.  The pickle is divine. 

My husband brought one home for me last night (since they are only open until 2 something and I rarely get to go) and it was even delicious warmed up six hours later!!  To go is accompanied by thousand island, horseradish, mustard, and two pickles (for a reuben, at least). 

We just love this place and I can only imagine how many steers they go through a day!!"}
{"text":"Even though I'm about as Irish as you can get, I don't even eat corned beef on St. Patty's day. Since it's the specialty here, however, I couldn't really not get corned beef. So I ordered it and my entire view on corned beef has been reversed!

First of all the sandwich is HUGE I ate half, but I was actually full before I even finished that half. I bagged up the other half to take home to my dad because he called me in the middle of lunch and was so jealous that I was eating here!

The restaurant itself is pretty small but you don't have to sit at a table and be waited on. There's also a line where you can get served cafeteria-style as well if you don't want to wait for a table. I sat at a table during this visit and I enjoyed looking around at all the Cleveland memorabilia on the walls.

I will for sure go back, but I'll probably just go through the line and get my food to go because the wait for a table was kinda long (obv because this place is a Cleveland classic)."}
{"text":"This deli deserves far more than 5 stars, I'll start with that right now. 

I went with my boyfriend this morning a little after 11am for lunch. We have been talking about trying this place for a while and our schedules finally matched up for us to go (Slyman's closes at 2:30pm). There weren't many people there at all. We were able to pick our own seating. Since we heard the sandwiches were so big, we decided to split a corned beef Reuben with fries. I've never tried corned beef so it was new territory for me. 

I was happy we got there when we got there because not too soon after did the people start POURING in. There were 3 ladies waiting tables and let me tell you something, they were a marvel. I've never seen such an attentive group of waitresses before in my life. 

Now to the food...this sandwich is huge. It was a good thing we decided not to get two whole sandwiches. Usually quantity doesn't equal quality, but that was certainly not the case. You get a lot of great quality meat.  

We left with full bellies and smiles on our faces. It was hard to get out because there were so many people waiting for there's. As we walked away there was a line forming out the door understandably so."}
{"text":"This is a classic spot that seems frequented by locals and tourists (yes, there are tourists that come to Cleveland) like myself. The walls also show who's visited (lots of celebrities and former presidents). 

Walked in decked out in my Cubs gear after a game seven win! One really awesome lady proclaimed \"stuck around to rub it in, huh?!?\" Actually stuck around for the sandwich. Totally worth it. 

Sat down at the counter and had the corned beef Reuben. Fyi the line is typically for to-go orders, so be sure you don't burn time if you want to sit down (like I did). 

It's a massive sandwich and is priced accordingly. The corned beef is nicely shredded and the cheese, rye, and sauerkraut dialed in nicely. 

I ate half and enjoyed it. Also enjoyed seeing locals banter with the staff (they all seemed to know each other). The folks running it seem to be all family --- good stuff."}
{"text":"Hands down the best reuben ever, not just in Cleveland. I've eaten in the restaurant and ordered carryout. I have only ever eaten the corned beef and pastrami here; both are great but a corned beef reuben would be the authentic choice. I make sure to take out-of-towners here, and can't wait until my dad visits as he is a true New Yorker and won't believe it until he sees/tastes it.  Service is fast and accommodating, waiters are nice.  You can definitely get two meals out of one sandwich, and you will probably need a nap afterwards.  I only have one gripe about the restaurant, and it's pretty insignificant hence the 5 stars: one of the guys behind the counter that bags the sandwiches opens the paper bags by whipping them through the air, and the sound is SO loud and piercing. It's enough to drive somebody slightly crazy! All in all, Slyman's sets the bar for their product: amazingly delicious corned beef and pastrami sandwiches!"}
{"text":"No review needed. Simply the best corned beef any where including anywhere in NY city.  Awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"I would second all the five star reviews on Yelp. Best pastrami I have ever had, better than the best in NY, LA. Definitely, the crown jewel of CLE's culinary scene. No need to waste any more ink (or pixels) on how great they are at their craft.

Pro tip: order the pastrami, corned beef, and every other sandwich on the menu. Take a bite of each for your meal, pack it to go, and then repeat for the next 10 meals. You may die from all the unhealth-fulness, but it would be a good way to go."}
{"text":"I've been coming here and waiting in line ever since I was a youngster with my Dad, and it's still worth the wait. Been around 2 years since I've had one of their famous Reuben's, but it's a must stop on my next trip to CLE!"}
{"text":"25 degrees December weather and you still have a line out the door.  That has to say something about the quality of the place. 

Of course, a trip to Cleveland isn't complete without a pit stop to Slyman's.  This time I managed to drag the in-laws and they were equally as happy.  

You just can't get a Reuben anywhere else like you can at Slyman's.  I wish they would ship their corned beef.  I would certainly be a loyal customer."}
{"text":"The #1 Best Corn Beef Sandwich in the State of Ohio!   Made fresh every day!  Mounds of fresh corn beef with Swiss cheese on rye bread with mustard is my fav!  It is so big that two people can share it!!!"}
{"text":"We come from Texas for slyman's corned beef!!!!

Ok we visit family too ;) After we first have our belly fully of the best corned beef ever!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here on a recommendation from our Uber driver. He did not \"steer\" us wrong! It's a cute little diner type eatery with breakfast and lunch. You should not leave here hungry! Our waitress was super! She quickly got my breakfast order in, even though there was only 5 minutes until it was finished. Everything was phenomenal! Our waitress went a step further by not just telling us, but going outside and showing us where to walk to our next destination. I'm told this is a Cleveland franchise. We would recommend it to anyone! We will be back if we ever get to Cleveland again!"}
{"text":"I'm usually not a big fan of corn beef/reubans, but my fiance insisted he wanted to try this place.  We got there around 9:30am in the morning, I ordered the corn beef with one egg and he ordereded the reuban.  It's probably the best corn beef I've ever had.  Service was excellent, people were very friendly there.  It was like a local/mom/pop shop.  I liked it.  I will be back.  I would recommend this place for anyone that likes Reubans.  Oh and the sandwich is huge!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Our waitress Candice was a doll, and very (sarcastically) funny.

I was actually able to convince my husband to come here 2x in a 5 day trip to Cleveland - so that is saying something.

The first time 3 of us got 2 Rueben's to split and an order of onion rings - PLENTY of food.

The 2nd time my hubby and I got the Corned beef \"melt\" and we asked if we could have 1/2 pastrami ($1 upcharge and 1/2 corned beef. Plus we got French fries (KRINKLE-CUT!!! - which we don't see much of on the west coast). This gal loves an onion ring, but the fries here were better, super hot and crispy.

My hubby voted for the 2nd sandwich as better - I liked the original Rueben, and while they are indeed HUGE, they meat is sliced so thinly that the meat was sort of light & airy - if that makes any sense.  

I lived in NYC for 10 years and this is as good as the great deli's there."}
{"text":"As a person who is not a huge fan of corned beef this place makes it perfect!!! It is thee place to get your Reuben fix in CLE. We go here every St. Patty's day but I strongly urge you get there very early. This place in normally packed but on St. Patty's it is times 100. It is a fast pace place...make sure you know what you want when it is your turn or you will catch grief. The sandwiches are worth it trust me! Put this place on your list of places to try!"}
{"text":"The best corned beef around! Big sandwich and full of flavor. It is soo good. Luv this place"}
{"text":"Hands down the best corned beef sandwich I've ever had. And I've had Izzy's in Cincinnati, and in nyc- Katz, Carnegie and stage. I've had Danny's in Columbus which is amazing so I was aware of slymans...same family. Slymans atmosphere and vibe were so authentic. And Sam's passion and hospitality make the whole experience. The sandwhich was huge. sliced perfectly, was so moist and so exceptional. And the potato pancakes were so good.  Don't bother with the 2 franchise locations go to the original on St Clair."}
{"text":"My husband and I went for lunch.  It was the first time for both of us.  We got a table fairly quickly.  The prices are ridiculous in my opinion.  Apparently my husband didn't look at the prices and assumed it was around $10 so he had a little sticker shock when the bill came.  Was it pretty awesome corned beef?  Yes....but it was also pretty dry.  I also wish they had fountain soda as opposed to cans.  Because it was so dry I would have preferred to have more to drink.  I'd much rather have them give me 2/3 of the meat they put on the sandwiches and take a few bucks off the price.  Then again, there's a line out the door for this place even on a chilly day so clearly they're doing something right...or there's a lot of people willing to pay for overpriced corned beef sandwiches."}
{"text":"The greatest cornbeef sandwich I've ever had in my life. 

This is a place that the \"Man vs. Food\" guy should have visited.  The sandwich is expensive (around $10)...but...you get what you pay for.  Things are huge and high quality.  And they don't use that junk cornbeef with all sorts of fat to take up space.  This is lean meat.  

An absolute MUST VISIT location in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Best corned beef sandwich I ever had. That sums it up. Who cares about the other stuff."}
{"text":"Super quick service, nice staff and huge portions of great food. It's a simple deli with tons of good food that isn't found around Ohio often. If you love deli sandwiches, you'll love this place- I got the tuna melt, and my boyfriend got the Reuben which were both humongous. Come ready to eat!"}
{"text":"Went in right before the lunch crush hit and was immediately greeted with a friendly smile and welcome.  We wanted to sit down and have a sandwich and like I just previously mentioned, it was right before the lunch crush so there were tables available without delay.  Wife and I ended up splitting the pastrami sandwich just because they are huge and my doctor said I am not supposed to eat a whole one (although I would have loved to) but atlas I shared.  Our waitress was efficient and friendly.  She took our order and buzzed off.  It didn't take long before she buzzed back with our sandwich and told us she gave us an extra pickle since she knew we were splitting the sandwich.  We got our with cheese and grilled bread and I have to say it was fantastic.  The bread, cheese, and pastrami were all in unison singing like the 3 tenors.  I thought the pastrami was really tasty and not over salty at all.  I can easily see why people love this place and if I am ever in Cleveland again, I would come back.  Now, I have to run a few extra miles this week to burn off the sandwich calories and carbs or else I get yelled at by my doctor.  :("}
{"text":"We all love places that can give us a sense of comfort.  This is especially important when we are traveling, in unfamiliar territory, or just down right sad.  This place does not only do that, but when you bite into that perfectly tender, well seasoned corned beef, you know you have reached your happy place.  Thank you Slyman's, for always providing consistent delicious food with a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Grew up in Cleveland but now live in Columbus.  No good CB in Columbus.  Many Clevelanders rave about Slyman's so I had to try.  Ordered CB on rye.  Sandwich was a C+.  Plenty of meat but meat was not very moist, warm, not very flavorful and expensive.  I believe Chicago Deil (Solon) or Corky & Lenny's (Woodmere) has a much superior product."}
{"text":"We CAN NOT visit Cleveland without visiting Slymans!

One sandwich could easily fill the bellies of 2 people, but what would the fun be in that?  One of the best parts is eating your sandwichs' other half later that night or next day, yummo!  My 6 month old was even trying to grab a bite - he already has good taste!"}
{"text":"As everyone else says, great corned beef. The sandwiches are ridiculously large -- really too large to fit into your mouth -- but if you order a couple extra slices of bread you can turn it into two sandwiches and take one home for tomorrow's lunch. Lines are out the door for carryout near closing time. What really turns Slyman's into a four-star for me is the atmosphere -- it's the kind of place some big chain would like to be able to recreate but would end up feeling fake. This kind of atmosphere has to be developed over time."}
{"text":"Yum- best corned beef Rueben ever! The sandwhich was loaded with tender, very lean corned beef- perfect!  Restaurant not fancy; place was clean; service was fast and friendly.  All the food being served looked delicious!"}
{"text":"Great sandwiches in a timeless atmosphere.  This has been voted one of the top ten sandwich places in the nation according to at least one article I read. It's famous for corned beef sandwiches buy the turkey is great.  The atmosphere is so cool, original older decor."}
{"text":"great deli.  all these reviews on this site that give it 4 - 5 stars are spot on.  I had the corned beef which was as good as any I have ever had from Chicago or NY.  2nd sandwich i got was Turkey and it was very very good.  I will come here every time i pass through Cleveland!!  nuff said"}
{"text":"Corned beef sandwich on rye with Swiss cheese - oh my! It's like butter - I mean the corned beef literally melts in your mouth and I want another one now - The place is commotion city at 12:00 - I came in by myself for lunch - yeah I just wanted a corned beef sandwich - I was seated at the bar then moved to a table - wow and they were apologetic and we are sorry - I don't care just came in for a corned beef sandwich and I took one to go - because they are soooo good!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Like everyone else, I have to agree that slyman's has some of the tastiest corned beef sandwiches ever. It's true -- the sandwich is about 5-6 inches high. Corned beef is definitely the way to go if it's your first time there. 

Besides the terrific corned beef sandwiches, here are 5 more reasons why I enjoyed slyman's:

5) I think it's terrific that you can get \"shavings\" and create more sandwiches at home.
4) The service was amazing. I went during lunchtime with a large group of friends, and my one friend said it was her first time there and asked what to get. The owner was so welcoming and definitely suggested the corned beef. I enjoyed the friendliness and the attention paid to the customer. 
3) Fun banter. \"You're ordering the corned beef sandwich for the first time? Great, see you tomorrow. It's that good.\"
2) Excellent, hole-in-the-wall surprise. There's nothing more that I love than hole-in-the-wall finds.
1) Cleveland pride. This is definitely one of those Cleveland gems. You must go!"}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich I've had in Cleveland. The corned beef sandwich is incredible. Go there for a lunch your taste buds will remember"}
{"text":"This Cleveland corned beef institution lives up to the hype, and then some. The smell of corned beef nearly knocked me over as I walked into the well-worn, dive-looking restaurant. At 1:15 on a Friday the wait for a table was nominal. Though, the takeout line was a bit longer.

There's no need to even open your menu. You must order the Reuben. Got it? Good.

The corned beef was the best I've ever had (I think) with just the right amount of fat. And, the dill pickles (nearly still in cucumber state) were awesome. Our server couldn't have been more friendly.

Take note that Slyman's closes at 2:30 pm and is not open on Saturday and Sunday (I've made the trek on a weekend only to find it closed and my corned beef dreams crushed.) They also serve breakfast on the weekdays from 6:00 am to 11:00 am."}
{"text":"Wow! The line was out the door! We were seated quickly and got our HUGE sandwiches and fries quickly! My husband had cornedbeef and said it was amazing. The fries in gravy were great! I had a pastrami rueben and it was fabulous.  Would definently eat there again. Service was great, just prepare yourself to eat and move out during the busy lunch time rush!"}
{"text":"Trust me on this review, that Slymans is absolutely the best place for a corned beef sandwich. This place is so good; they aren't even open on the weekends! They make all their money throughout the week and leave us drooling for more. I don't eat beef or pork unless its close to the end of the year or when I want to be a bad girl, but whenever I go home I make an exception to eat at Slyman's (lol)! As a native of Cleveland, OH now living in Atlanta, I really miss Slymans. I love that there are only two in the country and both are in Cleveland. If it were franchised the quality of the food may decrease. The sandwiches are about 5 inches big and they come with a pickle and mustard or with whatever you request. $8.50 is the cost of the sandwich now (price went up). They are located downtown Cleveland on St. Clair. If they are too packed inside see their sister location right around the corner in a green building. 

They also have great breakfast meals, also large in portion. This place caters to truck drivers so early risers will love coming here. Hours of operation are from 6AM - 2PM and they close promptly. Check out the Food Network for their rendition on why Slyman's is the best place to order corned beef sandwiches from in the country! And if you don't like Slyman's corned beef, well... you don't like corned beef."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for quite a while so I'm glad I finally got to try it out! It's definitely lived up to my expectations :) we came here on a weekday at 1pm and were seated right away. We told the server it was our first time, so she recommended quite a few of their popular items. We shared the corned beef melt and the pastrami Reuben. At first, we were brought 2 corned beef sandwiches because of a misunderstanding. However, the server immediately took one back and brought us the pastrami we had asked for. The corned beef sandwich had thinly sliced beef that was so tender, it melts in your mouth. The flavor was also perfect--not too salty! It went well with the thousand island dressing! The pastrami was a little too salty for my taste unfortunately. I had to slap on a ton of thousand island dressing to tame the saltiness down. Don't get me wrong, the pastrami is still good but I just prefer it with less salt. Overall, fast service and good food!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to come here forever. The corned beef was expensive but enormous. It's exactly what you'd expect - good food, decent prices, nice but hurried service, and a full belly."}
{"text":"Whenever I drive by to past this area or is in Cleveland for the sport games, I have to stop by slyman's! The best corned beef sandwich around... giant sized sandwiches! Be sure to ask for their homemade dipping sauces to dip the sandwiches in with! Yum!"}
{"text":"Thanks to the Yelp recommendation, we found this gem following a quick overnight in Cleveland.  In & out in no time.  All 9 of us loved the cornbeef.  Only complaints from the New Yorkers is that they need to ditch the yellow mustard for spicy brown deli mustard.  Ok, the Reuben needs more sauerkraut, but there is no doubt this place blows Katz's deli (lower East side of NYC) away!!   Make sure you order some slaw and potato salad."}
{"text":"I still don't like there corned beef but I had THE BEST open or closed faced roast beef meal I EVER HAD!! The rich brown gravy smothered French fries Texas toast and the most tender beef I've ever eaten. Its a must have try it you won't be disappointed.."}
{"text":"Don't gothere for breakfast! Great place for lunch or dinner, but their breakfast buffet leaves much to be desired."}
{"text":"Even if you don't like Corned Beef, you will LOVE Slyman's Corned Beef. It's literally the only place outside of New York that has Corned Beef on-par with Katz's. And in my opinion, Slyman's actually edges Katz's......

I literally have to let that sink in.......(So Far) Slyman's had the best Corned Beef sandwich...Anywhere....

So yeah, if you come here, it's a given you should be getting the Corned Beef.  Do not entertain the pastrami. Get the beef..."}
{"text":"Not being from Cleveland I probably would have not  ever gone without it being recommended.  I can honestly say I can't wait to go back.  Parking is a challenge and if you want take out there will probably be a line out the door (there was the day I was there).  We got a table inside and our service was great.  I'm glad I had a big appetite because the sandwich was HUGE!  I wasn't able to finish (I only had half) but I would order it again and again."}
{"text":"Holy crap! What the hell was I eating before? This stuff they call corned beef here is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Cleveland institution that you have to try if you're in Cleveland. Consistently solid corned beef and pastrami sandwiches and great staff. Only reason why I don't give it a five star is because there isn't anything there that really blows my mind"}
{"text":"Chicago has Manny's Deli, NYC has 2nd Ave. Deli (and Katz's and Carnegie Deli) and Cleveland has Slyman's. This place is an institution here, and deservedly so. i thoroughly enjoyed the corned beef sandwich, which featured shaved, lean corned beef served warm on a soft-ish rye. In the size department this sandwich falls somewhere in the middle of the road...definitely overstuffed, but not obscenely so. The pickles are the perfect degree of, well, pickled. Great deli in the rock -n- roll capital of the world."}
{"text":"When in Cleveland it's a must visit. Friendly staff great Reuben we shared a sandwich three ways. 

They have coke products ice tea is a bottle of Gold Peak. 

Reuben side of slaw and drinks $23.76. 

I'll attach a photo. Parking lot next door"}
{"text":"So with work bringing me to Cleveland I started looking for lunch on Yelp and found Slyman's Restaurant \"Featuring Cleveland's biggest corned beef sandwich\" got to say it was pretty darn good but adding the horseradish along with the thousand Island dressing just topped it off. The price is $$ but the sandwich is enough to split for two, if not completely eaten they conveniently give you wax paper and a brown bag to go. Overall the experience was extremely fast, fun friendly and deli tasty. I would definitely recommend and come again!! this is what Cleveland hospitality is all about..."}
{"text":"If you have to stand in line to get Corned Beef, this is the best place to do it! There arent even words to describe how scrumptious their corned beef tastes. Service s OK. It you flirt a little, you can get extra bread and pickles. Ether way, Slyman's is #1 for corned beef. You can take it to the bank."}
{"text":"Best Reuben Ever!

When I read the reviews and saw the pictures I was excited but they do this sandwich NO justice. This was the best Reuben I have ever had in my life!

The Corned Beef was tender, juicy, flavorful and all around amazing, that and they PILE and PILE AND PILE this stuff on your sandwich. I love that they give you a bottle of thousand island on the table because I was just putting some on as I ate it. 

This sandwich was no ordinary sandwich let me tell you. You need to get out and try this thing.

And don't let the fact that this place is in the middle of east-nowhere Cleveland discourage you, it's totally worth stopping in.

I was also surprised that the interior was very VERY clean! For a place that's been around as long as they have the place was immaculate! I liked that!

The waitress was nice, but you can tell they overworked her as she was a bit frazzled but the service was good nonetheless.

Overall I am SOOOO glad I stopped here while visiting!

*Also, they do take credit cards and pricing is about $10-$15 a sandwich, but seriously it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I know this doesn't matter because you're always busy and my review won't mean much, but my family and I had the worst experience we've ever had in a restaurant today. We are all servers and understand that closing means closing. However, we came in 30 minutes before close and were meeting family who was already sitting down. The employees tried to tell us that we could only order Togo and gave us a bad vibe when we went to sit with our family. We sat down and immediately were rushed. 'We close at 2:30 so you have to hurry' is what our server told us.  We ordered our drinks and not even 90 seconds later she was trying to take our order. She seemed very put off, which is crazy because we had full intentions of leaving her a good tip for serving us so close to close. For food that only took 3 minutes to get out to us, we didn't understand why she was rushing us so much. I didn't even get the opportunity to look over the menu to order my food. So I watched every else eat. She checked on us one time and continued to rush us without even bringing us the check. As it neared 2:30 she started sweeping under our table while we were still sitting there, then contributed to try to make conversation to assure herself a tip. She asked how old my daughter was and when her birthday was. When I told her that she was born on New Year's Eve she then looked at me and said 'wow, that's a nice tax exemption'. SHE CALLED MY DAUGHTER A TAX EXEMPTION. I was completely in shock that she would call my daughter something so awful and demeaning. When I said something to the lady at the register all I got was a half assed apology. It's upsetting that my moms old stomping grounds have been ruined for us by an experience this awful. It's safe to say that we will not be returning until the staff gets a lesson on how to treat their guests."}
{"text":"Totally legit place, with great food and a bit of style. I am a true New Yorker, and believe New York food is best in all circumstances. Their corned beef sandwich was excellent, and I had a pastrami Reuben that was perfect. I went with the \"stadium mustard\" which finished the job nicely. When the waitress found out I was from New York, each tome she came by the table would say \"hey New York, how you doing? Need anything?\" Perfect place for a stop for a huge sandwich."}
{"text":"Best Corned Beef. Period. Better than NYC. Melt in your mouth tender, never fatty or tough, Outstanding flavor. This Deli is the real deal.Everything on the menu is fresh, well prepared and memorable. Rubens, egg salad, coleslaw, pickles are all authentic. Service is pleasant. Not inexpensive, but worth it."}
{"text":"Absolutely love love love this place it's a Cleveland staple, if you come from out of town there's a few things that you must do and that's.

1: Visit the Westside Market

2: Visit Slymans and get the best and the BIGGEST corned beef sandwich ever!

3: Visit the Superman house. 

4: Visit the Christmas story house."}
{"text":"I have been going to Slyman's Deli for 20 plus years, and it has changed little in all that time. Hands Down - Still the most Amazing , juicy, gigantically tall corned beef sandwich on fresh rye bread I have ever had in my life!!!  

I feel my arteries clogging just thinking about it!"}
{"text":"Locals, locals, locals! The food and service is amazing and the best.   Can't say enough goodness about this place....   Be prepared for a great experience... If you want to experience the heart of Cleveland, you'll find it here.   From the time you pull up till you pull away.  For those who are out of town...   It's a must go and the locals know it...  If you can go at off peak times otherwise it's a wait but well worth it."}

{"text":"My first time in Cleveland and a friend brought us here for lunch. We had the Corned Beef Sandwich and it was fantastic. Easily the best corned beef I have had. The three of us split two sandwiches and some fries and it was plenty. The sandwiches are well worth the price and the staff is great. Got to meet The owner and he is a great guy. Highly recommend this place to anyone visiting or living in the area."}
{"text":"Moe wants to know if you believe in Jesus. Do you? He hopes so.

\"I'll see you in heaven,\" Moe, working the cash register, tells a customer. \"Hopefully I won't be running the deli up there.\"

Everyone who heard him laughs, because Moe's already running the deli down here. Slyman's, in northeast Cleveland. Known for sandwiches -- specifically corned beef -- this place is all about God and good karma, too. It's not all in-your-face, but it's there. I find it refreshing.

In the bathroom, laminated verses from the Book of Matthew recount Jesus's sermon on the mount. Part of it reads:

\"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink.\"

Fair advice. But I did come here for the food. For that corned beef sandwich. To see what the hype was about.

The only place to sit was the low counter that faces all the Three Stooges memorabilia, wedged between three customers to my right and boxes of delivery and/or to-go orders stacked on my left. Why The Three Stooges? Larry...Curly...Moe. Get it?

Prayer pamphlets are stacked in front of the cash register.

\"Take as many as you want!\" Moe tells another customer as he works the machine. \"God bless.\"

Moe doesn't look like he just came off of Mount Sinai. In fact, he looks like he spends more of his time in the kitchen than at the register. He's heavyset, balding, if not bald, and wearing casual clothes. He doesn't dress like a disciple. Nor does he dress like he owns the place. But preach, brother, because the corned beef sandwich on rye is delicious. Even better with a little mustard.

That must be why there's a line out the door. Why the only seat I could find was at the counter. Why it took a whole minute to worm my way to the bathroom between the other customers and the hardworking women who served them. So this is what blue-collar Ohio looks like. These are the humble folks just trying to make their way through the day.

I never liked Ohio much, even though I had never been outside the airport until this week, when I spent most of the time in the suburbs. But I had to make my way downtown, or at least in the city proper, and eat something authentic.

Slyman's is authentic.

\"How's school goin'? Good?\" Moe asks a boy in his late teens or early 20s. \"I hope so.\"

My check comes, and I go to pay at the register, just a few feet from where I ate. I go to pay Moe. He swipes my credit card and thanks me. I can't sign for a tip? No. No need to sign the receipt.

I open my wallet, spot a $5 bill and a $20. My meal was only about $8. I need some $1s so I can tip. I can tell Moe's too busy to break my $5, even though he probably would if I asked. Moe's working hard. So is everyone else. They don't deserve $1s for their tip. So I hand the $5 to Moe.

\"Leave that on your table,\" he says. \"I didn't do nothing for ya.\"

I smile at Modest Moe. I walk back to my spot to lay the $5 down.

\"You're a good man,\" he says.

God bless.

{"text":"I had the most perfect breakfast this morning for less than $5.00, $4.86 to be exact!  I normally don't eat a big breakfast during the week, before work, but this morning I had a taste for breakfast.  I stopped in, the restaurant was busy.  I sat down and ordered breakfast.  The waitress handed me a newspaper to peruse, while I waited.  My food arrived a short time later.  Two perfectly cooked over-medium eggs, with tender hash browns, bacon and rye toast.  Everything was warm, fresh and delicious.   I can't WAIT to return!"}
{"text":"We live in New York, so we have pretty high standards for corned beef and reubens - but I'm here to tell you, Slyman's kicks Katz's butt! BEST. CORNED. BEEF. EVER. Also, this place is just fantastic - the patrons who were there when we had lunch are probably the most diverse mix of people I've ever seen at a restaurant. Often famous places like this tend to have slightly dismissive, even rude, wait staff, but not at Slyman's - the staff was super friendly, even to tourists like us. Slyman's made our trip to Cleveland memorable for a lifetime!"}
{"text":"Slyman's has been a staple in Cleveland for as long as I can remember. One of the biggest and best corned beef sandwich you will have in your life! Their generous portion does come with a price, but if you buy one sandwich you could possibly make it into 3 or 4. On St. Patrick's day people start lining up early, after a while the line wraps around the block, so get there early!"}
{"text":"Cleveland best corned beef for sure!
Intimate deli atmosphere, extra friendly staff and truly HUGE sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great corned beef sandwich! Friendly staff, clean restaurant, good price for what you get. Very quick and easy as well. Parking is available in back but limited however street parking is available. My wife and I were town for a wedding but will definitely stop by anytime we are in town again! Worth the stop!"}
{"text":"The best corned beef in Cleveland! I generally go for a Reuben and get a tuna sandwich to go. The tuna salad is out of this world. If you like corned beef and have never been, go there now!"}
{"text":"Small location but big on flavor and service. Had a corned beef sandwich and it was outstanding. Quality meat, lots a menu items and quick service. I've been to other locations but this one has a very old school...where it all began feeling. Love all the locations but the vibe here is pretty dope. They close early so get in there before they shut down for the day."}
{"text":"Before I go too far, a 3 star rating means a-ok.  It's a good rating.  It's not like a C grade at an educational institution.  To me, 3s are more like Bs and B minuses.

Slyman's is a Cleveland institution and it should be.  It's a true to form East Coast styled deli that is obviously located at, or near, where it was born and that attracts loyal locals, tourists, and even movie stars, with the photos to prove it. 

I like corned beef and that's what Slyman's is famous for.  I just don't like it in a sandwich.  I prefer it in a dish, such as corned beef and cabbage with potatoes.  So, if you aren't absolutely set on corned beef, the other two highlighted options sitting to its side on the menu board are roast beef and pastrami. That said, I went with the roast beef sandwich and ordered it on either white or wheat bread.  I don't like rye bread (think seeds) and they didn't have sourdough bread.  People asked me, \"What, you didn't get the corned beef?\"  The roast beef was tender and its texture was ideal for a sandwich but, like others have mentioned and shown in photos, it's the size of one's head and the price for the sandwiches was a little high.  However, if the portions were \"translated\" into or \"transported\" onto meal platters, the price would be right, so this then becomes moot.  Regardless, you will be very full after eating one.

Slyman's is located on St. Clair Avenue, just east of downtown and east of I-90.  The area is more industrial and is becoming a neighborhood with an increasingly Asian identity, albeit still a small enclave.  St. Clair, Chester, and Euclid all run sort of parallel and across the city, east of downtown.  While the area shuts down at night, coming here during their breakfast and lunch hours, which is when Slyman's is open, ought to be fine.  They have a small private lot and, being on a very large street, parking can be found and it's also free of charge if you heed the signage.  The servers were very nice, including the ones who didn't wait on your table.

Here's why I am giving this institution 3 stars, as in a-o.k.  The menu sort of has a \"canyon\" in it.  You've got the sandwiches that make Slyman's the pop star it probably never intended to be, and a de rigueur stop, that are priced in the $12 to $15 range and then you've got burgers, other sandwiches, and breakfast fare that are priced in the $6 to $9 range.  In looking at others' tables, many of which were seemingly occupied by either locals or area employees, it looked that they had ordered the other types of things, such as the burgers and breakfast.  If I were to eat the other items they offer, and they were as good as the massive sandwich, then Slyman's would be a slam dunk for a 4 star locale.  Still, I found the restaurant to be on the very strong end of the 3 star spectrum."}
{"text":"First time really just out here moving around in Cleveland. Heard about this place from a couple friends, and they were absolutely right about this place. The sandwiches were AMAZING.. service was great too. Food came right out no hassle.. I hope you all feel just as satisfied as I do after leaving the restaurant. I will definitely be back here in the future."}
{"text":"Vegetarians need not enter. 
Fuck Winne Dixie. THESE ARE THE BEEF PEOPLE!

Since I am not a 300+ man, I was never going to be able to eat one of their sandwiches in one sitting. I got the Pastrami melt. Best I've ever had. Like nothing else has ever come close. But I took half the meat off and put it in a to go box. Heats up well at home. 

They are incredibly busy at lunch. 
They have desserts, but dude, \"how can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?\""}
{"text":"Amazing food! Authentic NY style sandwiches...like 5\" tall no joke! Also, breakfast is incredible...corned beef hash is the best I've had!!!"}
{"text":"Service was fine.  Sandwich came out almost instantly, as if it's just sitting there.  No lettuce tomatoes, onion...?.  The WORST Roast beef sandwich I've ever had in 50 years! I'd rather have Jimmy John's.  Roast beef was crumbly it was so dry and overdone.  Iced tea in a bottle, condiments were generic.  I'm quite sure they're also evading income tax here as well.  Way overpriced too!. $40 for two sandwiches, (NO SIDES INCLUDED) 2 tea, Cole slaw and sauerkraut.  Paid by cc,, she ran my card for the full amount plus tip and gave me cash back to leave on the table for the server!"}
{"text":"In Cleveland, this place's corned beef sandwich in just about an NYC deli and have been to most of them. The sandwich is huge and 1/2 the price of NYC ones. Now I would like to see a better spicy brown mustard available like a guildens type, but I am now just being picky. The potato salad side that I had was among the best. The Yelpers definitely have the reviews right. A must if you are in the area. Don't forget to visit the The Stooges Shrine in the back if you like these guys. Enjoy"}
{"text":"Breakfast Review... yes... they serve breakfast.

We were in town early on Saturday morning for a plant sale \"down the street\" at 72nd street...and sure enough... they were open?

Hubby loved his HUGE fluffy pancakes. The home fries were perfectly tender and crispy without any onions or extra spices... just great plain potatoes! He was in heaven!

Th Salami and Swiss omelet had almost too much swiss... but it was a wonderfully chewy and stringy experience of a full flavored real swiss.

We got some beef brisket to go and it was slow sliced to order... and totally melt in your mouth great! I wanted it for a lunch sandwich... it didn't make it home to Summit county!

Don't let all the corned beef madness fool you... there are other options... and they are great at all of them!"}
{"text":"Read all the reviews; you can't go wrong.  Definitely a staple for Cleveland, and their breakfasts are amazing as well."}
{"text":"Corned beef doesn't get much better then THIS. Large sandwiches with some of best corned beef you will ever find."}
{"text":"Heard this was the place to get corned beef and pastrami in Cleveland. Had a Monday off from work, so the husband and I headed out to get there before the lunch rush.

Originally from NJ, I'll preface this with my metric for a great corned beef or pastrami is Katz' Deli in NY - where they still hand cut the meat for a simply delicious sandwich, with a chewy/crusty rye bread and the best spicy mustard.

We got in before the rush, were seated in the tiny dining room space and greeted by our friendly waitress. The corned beef sandwich was huge (1/2 went home with the extra bread), with LOTS of thinly sliced, lean corned beef on some okay (not especially flavorful) rye bread. But the meat seemed to be dry - it might just be a local thing, cuz everyone seems to love it - but I prefer a jucier corned beef.

Everyone from the door to the cash register was friendly - which gives Slyman's the edge over Katz' in that department - but I am still on the lookout for a juicy corned beef on a noticeably rye bread here in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I'm not suicidal nor do I condone such, but if you have an inclination to overdose, Slyman's is the way to go. I might suggest a huge dose of corned beef. I don't really like the phrase, but it IS to die for.
This is coming from a Denverite with nothing even close. I so miss Slyman's. Someone please tell me where I can have a Slyman's experience in Denver."}
{"text":"Went here with coworkers who recommended it and boy were they right....this place is awesome. Of course you have to go for their CORNED BEEF sandwiches which is what they are known for! Lots of good food so hang on! 

The staff was friendly and on top of their stuff and the restaurant has a good atmosphere about it! I recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"I love their corned beed sandwich and love that they built themselves into an institution from an industrial area location - to get 14 bucks for a sandwich is a great feat"}
{"text":"Slyman's deli was absolutely delicious! I was the second or third to the last customer of the day. Unfortunately their infamous corned beef Reuben were out. I got pastrami Reuben instead and it was really really good! It was a ton of meat indeed, you probably can't get much veggie from this place. If you are looking for a balanced and healthy eating meal, this may not be the right place for you. But their food is so good that I would be willing to occasionally take the guilt. Service was great as well. They were all really busy but still managed to talk to the customers in queue. Since I wasn't able to get my ideal order, they even gave me a side of fries for free, which is super sweet. Would totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My sandwich was delicious. The best pastrami and corn beef I have ever had. The flavor of the meat alone was amazing. Had mine grilled with cheese. Was visiting from out of town and was not disappointed. Dont know when I will ever have one again.  No."}
{"text":"Recommended by the local Fire Department, this family establishment prepares great brakfast items and lunch sandwiches.  My personal favorite is the Corned Beef, which was lean, moist, flavourful and right, not too soft, not hard at all and seasoned to perfection!  Being from Chicago, I can till you the food here is as good as the top Delis found in my hometown and even NYC.

Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I was driving back home from a trip to Ohio and had time for a brief stop in Cleveland. Yelp told me I should go here and so I did. The place is in an industrial-like area, closes fairly early, and inside looks like they haven't redecorated in decades. And I wouldn't change it for the world. 

It was no question the best Reuben sandwich I've ever had and I don't even love corned beef. Me and a friend shared as the sandwiches are so huge and I still couldn't finish all the meat on my half. 

Service was also incredibly pleasant which was an added bonus."}
{"text":"Cleveland. Hands down the best place for a great corned beef sandwich. Slyman's. Hands down our favorite! We come here when headed out of town and have them pack it up for travel. We come here upon arrival in town (when flying) because it's just that darn good."}
{"text":"Driving through the East side of Cleveland, you would not expect to come across this quaint little place. In fact, if I weren't looking for it, I would probably never even notice it. However, my husband discovered it recently and told me all about his experience so I had to try it! Being an EMT, he is out on the road a lot and ends up eating out a lot. And since you can only eat so much fast food before you absolutely hate it, you start to seek out these small, yet delicious hidden gems.

We decided to take a day trip to Cleveland last Saturday and he suggested Slyman's for lunch. He knows I love a good ruben but I don't think I was expecting to get this kind of corned beef. Ya know, the kind of corned beef that you wish every ruben had on it but you usually end up with a disappointing pile of dry, chewy, salty, disgustingness. Slyman's is NOT like that. Their corned beef is what ruben dreams are made of. Soft, tender, juicy little chunks of corned beef with amazing flavor in place of the loads of salt you get from other places. I loved that it wasn't over salted. It was utter perfection. It also came with a bit of saurkraut which gave it even more juicyness and tang. Not to mention the house made thousand island dressing (to die for!) and the horseradish sitting on the table which added the perfect amount of heat. All, of course, piled on top of perfectly toasted rye bread. It's what was intended when rubens were first invented.

Ok, so, when you walk into Slyman's it's a little chaotic. There are people cooking, people standing in line, people eating, tables everywhere, servers walking all over the place and it's a tiny building. But if you stay and get a table, you can relax and enjoy this giant sandwich (trust me, one sandwich is enough for two people). Our waitress was extremely attentive so we didn't want for anything during our visit. When the bill came, I went up front to pay and we left. On our way out, it was like we were a part of the neighborhood because everyone behind the counter waved and said goodbye to us like they've known us for years and truly hoped to see us again. And that, they will."}
{"text":"I don't think there is much that needs to be said about Slyman's. You just have to go! Giant corned beef sandwich = very happy belly. Best in CLE, best anywhere! Took my brother-in-law here yesterday. He's from NYC. He was impressed!

TIP: Try to go early to avoid a line and a wait. If you're doing takeout for lunch, sometimes the line is even longer than people waiting for a table. I noticed that people waiting in line when we first sat down just got their to go order as we were getting ready to leave."}
{"text":"Quick review from a guy from Baltimore.
Great deli sandwich. I got the Pastrami sumo (basically a pastrami sandwich with swiss cheese, horseradish and mayo). It was awesome. The rye bread was fresh and the meat was plentiful and flavorful. Four stars because I feel they should have included fries in the price of their sandwich.
The waitress I had was very pleasant. She made me feel at home in the place without saying much at all. The place is packed and there is a frenetic pace to everything that is going on in there. If you're a local or out of towner, this should definitely be on your list of places to eat while in Cleveland. It's a bit out of the city, but that's ok by me. I'll definitely make my way back to Slyman's if I'm ever back in Cleveland or passing through. They deserve the praise. I wouldn't go with a large group as seating is limited and you're sitting pretty close to whoever gets seated around you."}
{"text":"know for corned beef, but pastrami is worth a taste

C-Town staple

no need for fries - sandwiches are huge

but the fries are good

local diner in a big city

smells like success in there"}
{"text":"As a transplanted New Yorker I can attest to the fact that this is authentic deli style Corned Beef and absolutely the best in town-better than Corky and Lenny's by far! The corned beef sandwiches and Ruben's are wonderful and big enough to share and the french fries are so tasty they are worth the calories.  If you go for lunch be prepared to wait online behind Cleveland's finest and dozens of area contractors--the people who always know a great place to get good food and large portions at a great price."}
{"text":"Corned beef!

Slyman's is to corned beef as Katz's (NYC) is to pastrami.  Simply the best corned beef I've had anywhere, and I've looked high and low (just look at where all my reviews have been).  Moist, flavorful, tender.  I just wish I knew someone who lived there now (let's be reasonable, I don't think I would fly anywhere just to get any sandwich).

The service was great too... I agree with others saying that they are very welcoming, especially to first timers and outsiders."}
{"text":"One huge pile of dry corned beef. They cut every bit of fat off!! FAIL. Try Mr. Brisket or Cleveland Corned Beef Co. instead. Totally undeserved reputation"}
{"text":"Super delicious, humongous corned beef sandwiches. My boyfriend is a native of Cleveland and hands down Slyman's is his favorite restaurant so the first time I went to Cleveland with him he dragged me here.There was a line and the restaurant is small and crowded, but the service is fast and after trying the thinly sliced, flavorful corned beef you learn why. As soon as I sunk my teeth into my sandwich (I had to take out some corned beef to do so) I became a fan of Slyman's as well. Yum, Yum, Yum.  We're planning a trip to Cleveland now and question #1 is how many times to go the Slymans!"}
{"text":"If you live in Cleveland and you have not been to this establishment you are truly missing out on the 8th Wonder of the world. Slyman's has been around since the 14th century and has been making awesome roast beef,  corned beef  comma and turkey sandwich meat since as long as I can remember. The restaurant itself is not in a horrible area of town but a few blocks in either direction and you'll end up on a milk carton LOL. Seriously don't let the location keep you from going.

All joking aside you really cannot go wrong with having a meal from Slyman's Lee's Sandwiches you should really consider sharing with somebody because they are that big. I picked up a catering order for my work and the employees there could not have been more helpful to me. Parking can be a little challenging around lunch time there's almost no parking behind the restaurant but there is street parking.

Overall I cannot add to the other 9005 star reviews that are on here other than I cannot wait to go back"}
{"text":"'Scuse me while I whip this out. A five-star review, that is.

Slyman's. Dear, Slyman's. How the hell do you do it? You've managed to take a simple piece of meat, all but devoid of character, lackluster in its common nature, and you've transformed it into a work of art. If Michelangelo had chosen brisket instead of marble, this would have been David. If Shakespeare had found inspiration in ethnic deli foods, this his Romeo and Juliet.

What magic, what mystical activities must have occurred to allow such a transmogrification of animal flesh? I simply cannot believe that it came from this world. It's not possible. I won't allow it to be so. Something so wondrous, so divine could not have been fashioned by mere mortals. The Gods surely played a part.

Within your hallowed hall, your walls adorned with celebrities from near and far, a half-century's worth of corned beef essence lingers. How many loaves of rye bread gave their lives for this greater purpose? How many cucumbers walked willingly toward their briny doom, knowing full well that they were meant to lie next to a pile of cured, smoked meat? I dare not calculate such large numbers lest I approach the insanity known only by true geniuses.

Each bite is a spiritual journey. An Indian dream guide dressed in thin, stacked meat. Unctuous, tender, juicy, salty, smoky, brilliance embraced by slices of rye bread whose spice and seed can't help but spill in its honor. And the crinkle fries and creamy slaw, how they genuflect without countenance. How can such a creation be anything but food for the soul, manna rained down upon countless souls yearning for grease-covered lips? To the naysayers, to the cardiologically protective, I say I will not acquiesce. 

The crowds push the small, unassuming building to its limits. Tables packed with elbow-to-elbow pastrami fanatics, a daily occurrence to which I'm sure you've grown accustomed, yet still flitting servers and busboys manage to make each feel at home. Water glasses miraculously filled, napkins ever-present, and the line, my god the line, it never stops. The front door cant contain the faithful. They keep coming. Mouths agape, stomach's aching to be filled.

Slyman's, you are more than a restaurant. You are more than a palace of sliced meat. Slyman's, you are a piece of Cleveland. You are a cog in the Northeast Ohio machine without which the hum and whir of its progress would cease. You are  embedded deeply within the city's DNA, the adenine to its thymine, the guanine to its cytosine. Fifty years and counting. Carry on, my carnivorous brethren, for your path is beset by the hungry, paved by crushed appetites, and your mission right. Carry on, fulfill your destiny. Because of you, Oh Slyman's, Cleveland's corned beef legacy is made immortal."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness. I've never had corned beef this good. Granted, I'm from California so there's less opportunity. I've only heard fairy tales about corned beef like this. Wow! Succulent and tender, perfectly seasoned. Wanted to take some home on the plane. 

Fast friendly service too, even though it was packed to the gills when we were there for lunch."}
{"text":"UUUge pils of salty, tender, moist corned beef. REALLY friendly people. A classic spot. What else needs to be said?!"}
{"text":"This is one of the places that you have to try in order to call yourself a \"Clevelander\". It's best known for having the best & biggest corned beef in Cleveland. This is a smallish sit down restaurant, but there's nothing fancy inside; no-frills decor and typical of an 80s diner. The only thing I've had here was of course the corned beef sandwich. 

So how big is the sandwich? It's massive, I would say a good pound of slice corned beef, in between two pieces of rye bread. It's piled about 4-5\" high. You'll definitely want to knife and fork it. I'd be impressed if you can actually take a bite at it. The flavor from the meat is very good and wasn't dry or too fatty. I also had a side of coleslaw and fries. They were OK, but it complements the corned beef with a bit of veggies. You won't come here for that anyhow, so you shouldn't be disappointed if these were a let down. 

However, the prices have gone up at this place in the last few years, but at $12 a sandwich, its worth it for the experience and to proudly say that you've eaten at Slyman's!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best corned beef sandwich in the land! Super friendly staff and the owner Freddy is one of the nicest guys ever."}

{"text":"Reubens are delicious.  Expensive but tons of corned beef so some will not eat the whole thing in one sitting, bread is perfect, and kraut is very tasty.......have not had many of the sides but I'm not a fan of the french fries though"}
{"text":"Yep, it's everything everyone said it was. Great sandwiches, very crowded when we went but service was pretty quick. We were at a table that was next to the umpires that were in town for the World Series. Everyone must know about this place.  We had enough of our sandwiches left over for another meal.  Not bad prices either considering amount you get."}
{"text":"Oh, my, god.
We visited Cleveland during a long road for which I'd done a lot of research, and made lots of little notes and reminders of things to do upon arrival in different places. Among them was Slyman's, and as we approached, I couldn't remember what was so special that I'd made a note of \"Corned Beef at Slyman's\" in advance.
The line protruding out the front door was a good omen. We each ordered our corned beef sandwiches and took a seat, which was easy since most of the people in line were waiting on food to go.
You've got to be kidding me with this sandwich. It was so packed full of meat that I had to press it down considerably before I could fit a bite into my mouth. I've never in my life seen a bigger corned beef sandwich, and let's not forget to mention the terrific flavor of the meat. Made with love, this sandwich was, for a lunchtime nosh that kept my appetite satiated until very late at night.
If I'm ever back in Cleveland for any reason at all, this is it."}
{"text":"This was the only planned stop for our recent long weekend in Cleveland.  Even better than expected!

We arrived just after noon on a Thursday, and the place was busy.  We scored a spacious 4 top (after our waitress moved us from a 2 top jammed between other 2 tops...I didn't even need to give her a pained look).

We asked for a sandwich with both corned beef and pastrami on it (this is not on the menu), plus a side of coleslaw and an extra pickle. Once the sandwich arrived - HUGE!! - Ken and I split the meat and bread to have a half of cb for me and a half of pastrami for Ken.  I didn't order either lean, which is my usual for cb, but they were nicely lean while also remaining juicy and flavorful.  Mustard and horseradish are at the table.  Everything was amazing!  Ken compared this to Carnegie in NY and thought Slyman's was possibly the best deli sandwich he's ever had.  Wow!

They charge for extra pickle, but you will get an entire new-ish pickle.  A bit too much pickle if your dining companion doesn't eat his.

Bathroom was clean.

Parking:  we parked on the road a couple blocks past the restaurant.  No issues.

If you plan to use a credit card know that you cannot add a tip.  Bring cash to tip these hardworking folks."}
{"text":"Slyman's is one of Cleveland's most beloved hot spots and for a dang good reason. It's one of those places that doesn't dabble in anything that they can't blow out of the park. It's no lie that Slyman's has the best Corned Beef on the planet - simply because the beef is the star. There are no shenanigans going on in your sandwich. It's just a mass of mouth watering, high-blood-pressure-inducing corned beef on rye bread. Although the rye is also pretty good, it doesn't really matter because the meat is what people come for. And believe me, the people flock in masses. Don't plan on making it a quick in-and-out run because there is always a line out the door - a good sign for any restaurant. The staff are no-nonsense type of people but they are helpful and work hard to get you tasting their meat as soon as humanly possible. 

I also have to give major props on the thousand island dressing they use which is some of the best I've had. I could drink the stuff it is so good. While everything I've tried is great, the Reuben is my favorite. 

Don't be too shocked by the slightly hefty prices as you will be eating enough food to satiate a small village. You could probably make this meal last for 3 lunches if you wanted to... which you won't because it is just that good.

My only real complaint is that the hours are terrible. They close at 2 pm most days so if you were wanting some corned beef for dinner, you better plan on buying by the pound at lunchtime (which you fortunately can do)."}
{"text":"Best corned beef sandwich I've ever had in my life. Rye bread flown in from Orlando is dynamite. No fat on the corned beef. Add the mustard and sauce to your liking. Get a side of fries. Enjoy the pickle. Doesn't get better.

Service was awesome, I got a hard time for coming in with a dessert and not having enough to share with the waitresses. Guy next to me had been coming in over 30 years. Near flawless sandwich.

If you are from out of town, make sure to go on a day they are actually open and go early. Some gibroni gave them 1 star for showing up 5 mins late and not getting in with his family. Take a hike.

Langers = best pastrami
Slymans = best corned beef"}
{"text":"Poor Customer Service Experience: Rude and Unprofessional Staff Member!

I travel extensively for business.  Yesterday I was in Cleveland, Ohio on a business trip and I wanted to treat my clients to a nice take out lunch as a way to express appreciation and gratitude for their business.  The company executives suggested that I purchase their takeout lunch from Slyman's.  After the secretary took everyones lunch order she called Slyman's to place the order and they refuse to take the order because it was for four people.  Needless to say this should have been warning sign number one that this was an establishment that was not customer focused or friendly.

I arrived at Slyman's with one of my colleagues in line behind me with my list in hand.  The person taking the order appeared to be agitated and hurried to scream the order to the line workers.  When I moved to the register to pay for my order the person cutting the meat who takes all of the orders began to scream what I ordered to the cashier.  At this point I politely stated that I wanted to pay for the meals in a specific manner for business purposes.  I proceeded to share with the cashier what I ordered and then out of no where the agitated person who took my order verbally attacked me because he said I told him to put Swiss cheese on my sandwich.  At this point, I tried to share with him that he may have misunderstood the order because only one of the sandwiches was suspose to have Swiss cheese.  He immediately became extremely combative screaming that his hearing was very good and that I was going to pay for the sandwich with Swiss cheese because that's what I ordered.  At this point, I was fearful of my safety because it was obvious that he was enraged about a $1.00 slice of Swiss cheese.  After realizing that I was dealing with someone who was becoming unglued over a slice of Swiss cheese, I immediately apologized to defuse the situation and stated that I may have miscommunicated to him.  The cashier was obviously in agreement with this behavior or maybe this gentlemen was his boss because when I shared with him that I definitely did not order my sandwich with Swiss cheese because I do not like Swiss cheese, he replied in a very sarcastic and dimissive voice, \"Yes, dear.\" 

As I was leaving this establishment the man who verbally assaulted me stated, \"I will see you tomorrow.\"  When my colleague and I got in the car she said, \"I thought he was going to physically harm you over a slice of Swiss cheese.  He obviously did not know that I was with you and that you were paying for my lunch too\"  She continued to state as an Irish woman that she believes that his behavior was racially motivated because I am an African American female.  When we arrived back at the office everyone was in shocked to hear what had transpired at Slyman's.  In addition, I would like to add not only did he get my sandwich incorrect but I had requested white bread for all of the sandwiches and he made them all with rye bread.  It's obvious that no one in this establishment gave any thought to repeat business, customer service which is why I decided to take the time this afternoon to share my experience.

In closing, on my plane ride back home to New York, I was so grateful that this experience was behind me.  This afternoon I took a nice stroll down to Katz's deli to have a wonderful corn beef sandwich and experience wonderful customer service professionals.  

Thank goodness, I will never have to patronize this establishment."}
{"text":"Have been going here for over 15 years. If there is a Cornbeef god he is SLYMAN'S. You will not be sorry for making the trip."}
{"text":"Let me tell you how good this place is.

First-timer here.
Took a few pictures.
Ordered the traditional corned beef.
Demolished the thing (see pic)
Left the place.
IMMEDIATELY craved another one.

Good enough for me.  Fantastic!"}
{"text":"We wanted to visit this Cleveland landmark. We were not disappointed. The sandwiches are $15 but they are packed with meat--i mean packed! It was really good. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"After sawing a chunk off the side (yes, it's that tall) the first words out of my mouth were oh my God. I truly have never had a corned beef sandwich so good. The meat is very thin, very flavorful and the fattiness of the beef just makes it that much more enjoyable. The rye and swiss was also a good choice. I wouldn't recommend buying chips or fries, I didn't touch the pickle that came with it and I definitely couldn't finish. The sandwich was a whopping $16! Which is kind of crazy. And not something I would be able for afford regularly. But definitely worth a stop now and again!

Parking is hard, especially around lunch time. There was a line out the door when I came but if you plan to eat in, make sure that is the line waiting for pickup orders. I waited for a little bit until someone poked his head out and said is anyone eating in? I wouldn't have known otherwise!

Esquire named this as one of the Best Sandwiches in America. There are several meat options on the menu but I opted for the corned beef with swiss and rye.  It's been visited by many famous people, including President Obama, Bush and Rachel Ray!"}
{"text":"This is what Cleveland it's known for. Slymans is a true Cleveland staple. No matter if you come for breakfast or just to get a giant ass corned beef sandwich. This kind of food is only west of the Mississippi. Say what you want not many places can match slymans corned beef. Every since I was a little kid my mother would stop here after work and get two sandwiches and extra bread . Reason being these sandwiches are super big she would literally feed all of use. Growing up back then we didn't have the money so when you get treats you remember them. This location is located on the Clair not too far from where bone thugs are from lol. The staff is amazing they will get you in and out fast so don't be scared if you see a wait. If you ever are in the land make sure you hit them up and get that slamming corned beef with mustard on rye bread."}
{"text":"It's a shame that this place doesn't have as many television programs going to this place as, say, Melt Bar and Grilled.  Their specialty is corned beef.  If you're not a fan of that, then there's no point in going here.

With that said, their corned beef is a Cleveland icon - possibly the best I've ever had.  I've also heard that their Reuben is pretty good, as well.  This place is always packed, although it is on the other side of I-90 from downtown.  Parking is available on nearby streets (including St. Clair), and the place can be seen from a few blocks away based on how long the lines can get outside the door.

My only real complaint is that it's a little on the pricey side for a sandwich, with a corned beef sandwich costing $9 (cheese is extra).  However, the sandwich was overstuffed with corned beef.  This is Cleveland, so most sandwiches above $6 have to be really good and/or abnormally large to be worth the price.  This was certainly worth the 45 minute drive from Akron and the $9.70 I ended up paying."}
{"text":"Awesome pastrami sandwich and very nice people. Definitely a must visit for the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Slyman's is just ok, unfortunately. I know this is going to be an unpopular opinion, but I've eaten at enough delis in different places to at least have some feel for what makes a good deli joint. This place doesn't quite have it.

It has a great atmosphere, and the fact that it's so popular is sort of encouraging when you walk in: a neighborhood place in an unassuming part of town with a line out the door has to be good, right? The decor on the walls certainly says as much. It's plastered with pictures of celebrities who have paid this place a visit. 

Unfortunately, the secret to this place's sandwiches is meat, meat, and more meat. Why is that a bad thing? It's not, inherently, but it's nice to have a flavor apart from corned beef and some dry-ish bread, and you get so much meat that it rapidly turns into what I just described. I slathered mine in horseradish and had to get some extra just to give this thing some variety and extra action. The \"mountain o' meat\" approach also makes these sandwiches more difficult than they should be to eat. As much as I like to be dazzled by the amount of food I get, I also want to be able to eat it without dislocating my jaw first.

On top of that, the sandwiches here are pretty expensive: a sandwich and a soda could easily run $15 or $16, without getting into the other stuff they have. It's not that they're bad sandwiches, but they're not the best I've ever had, and I've had better sandwiches that were cheaper too (Schwartz's in Montreal comes to mind as both better and cheaper). For now, the hunt for a great deli in Cleveland continues."}
{"text":"BEST SANDWICH IN TOWN! U can feed a family of four on one Smurf! Aka the Reuben! Freddy is the man! I call him the maestro!"}
{"text":"First time at the castle that corn beef built and we were not disappointed. OMG was the CB w Swiss and yellow mustard fantastic. Even better we stopped by on a sunny Friday at noon.  We decided to carry out and we're through the line with our order in about ten minutes. The staff were friendly, the corn beef melts in your mouth and the substantial portion was supported by a firm and tasty rye. The fries were good but nothing fantastic and the cole slaw fresh and creamy. 

We live about 15 minutes away and will be back regularly. We would recommend Slymans to everyone who is not vegan."}
{"text":"The best corned beef outside of the five boroughs and perhaps anywhere. 
It comes thinly sliced and piled high and is tender and lean. The bread and cheese on this sandwich are mere hood ornaments.

This place isn't fancy, and it isn't cheap, but it's the real deal and a good value.

I live on the West Coast, but I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Not a lot of five star zones in Cleveland, but got to hand it to Slyman's. The best corned beef on earth.

I usually go to Slyman's on my lunch break during the work week. The trick is to eat up at the counter or grab a quick table when you see a line going out the door. You will wait in line longer than it will take to order, get served and pay. I only get a half hour and I'm never late on my way back.

This Cleveland style traditional corned beef sandwich is the best you can get anywhere. NY, keep your juicy corned beef, Slyman's is no joke. Keep in mind I am not a sauerkraut kind of guy, so this may void my opinion completely. The real heads get the kraut, I know..

Anyhow, they basically load up perfectly grilled rye bread with awesome swiss cheese, and stack it up about a quarter mile high. That's right, a quarter mile. At least. One sandwich is good for two meals. Unless you're on that Cleveland construction worker tip and you smash one of these bad boys down in a neon reflective vest with a helmet on while listening to 98.5 and holding a \"SLOW\" sign with the other hand. Drench it mustard and horse radish, go off accordingly. It's going to be great anyway you do it. 

The most legit sandwich in Cleveland, worth every cent."}
{"text":"A friend brought Slyman's over to a party, so I can't speak to the service or the ambiance of the place. The sandwich, though, was alright. I really like corned beef, and the meat on the sammy is good, but a bit dry. I mitigated the situation with extra mustard, but then flavor is lost. There is A LOT of meat on each sandwich!

I prefer the corned beef from Mr. Brisket on S Taylor."}
{"text":"I'm not really even qualified to talk about the history of this place, suffice to say, its been churning out huge meat sandwiches to patrons of this end of Cleveland for decades and generations.  If you want a corned beef sandwich or pastrami sandwich in Cleveland or maybe the Midwest, you are not going to find a better one than Slyman's.  This family has been doing nothing but making and selling corned beef, pastrami (and roast beef is a thing here, too) for longer than you've probably been alive!!!! 

It is $12 for a sandwich here, but its still a bargain.  You get probably over a pound of your choice of craft created, heirloom quality cured, brined meats served how they know you will like it.  Canned drinks and no judgment from the staff or patrons on how much of it and how fast you can eat the huge thing round out the experience.  Interestingly, it opens at 6am so you can get your fix early if necessary if you are working man.

I go every time I am in Cleveland for work or play from Columbus, no-brainer.  Just go and enjoy.  What else needs to be said?"}
{"text":"No need for a long review.  Slyman's serves up the best corned beef sandwich I've had.  Corky & Lenny's and Karl's Inn of the Barristers are not even in the same class.  I haven't had many New York City corned beef sandwiches, but I do know some native New Yorkers who have been to Cleveland and Slyman's and agree:  Slyman's corned beef sandwich comes out on top.  Obviously, it's a big sandwich--just about four inches of corned beef in between two pieces of rye bread--but anybody can make a large sandwich.  What sets Slyman's apart is the moistness of the corned beef without it being overly fatty.  On top (and bottom) of that, the softness of the rye bread adds texture and practicality--giving you a better grip around the behemoth of a sandwich.

The cole slaw side is decent, but nothing remarkable.  An order of extra bread is a smart choice if you're going to share or take part of the sandwich home.  The dining room itself has a lot of charm about it.  Tables and chairs are close together but short of being overly cramped.  I was able to walk in and get seated right away while the take-out line stretched five people deep out the door. Also, I was in and out extremely quickly--probably 25 minutes.

So, with all this praise, why the four stars?  I don't think Slyman's rises to the level of a destination--a place I would be willing to drive across state lines to get to."}
{"text":"Hands down the best corned beef I have ever had. My mouth begins to water at the mere thought of it. Worth the drive to an old neighborhood. Worth the wait in line. And worth twice the $10 price for the taste and 4 inches of corned beef and oh so soft fresh rye bread"}
{"text":"I love this place. I was introduced to this place as a kid as my father was a East Cleveland Firefighter and it is one of those around the way, blue collar, greasy spoon type of places. People in BMORE always talk about corn beef roll. It can even be placed in the same sentence as Slyman's. I will be stopping in Cleveland on route to the Detroit Intl Jazz Fest and this place is definitely on my list! The smurf with mustard is the way to go. The meat is warm, sliced perfectly and has the perfect meat/fat proportion!"}
{"text":"This place is in the same rare air space as Mother's in New Orleans. This is sandwich Mecca.

I could extol upon the virtues of eating here but could never capture just how good the food is. The City of Cleveland should make sure that every single person who lives in/comes to the city goes here. Not interested enough? Bobby Flay and Rachel Ray are just 2 of the notables who have been here and have loved the food. Heck Bush went there..."}
{"text":"SALTY SALTY SALTY!!!PASTRAMI-OVER RATED CLE ICON--The service was poor and the prices are simply not worth it-this is the first place they opened in the suburbs and they should of just stayed downtown-they are money hungry and expanding without consideration of aesthetics of neighboring structures-the outside of the building is a gross black red orange white toned with a pitch black parking lot that stinks like heavy tar and shockingly bright white lines that resemble what the attica state prison faciltiy must of looked like in the day - the inside for lack of a better way to explain is simply the dinky tavern look with no rhyme or reason--not a fan-if you want to get ripped off just go to blaze pizza around the corner for a skimpy piece of toast with ketchup sauce for 15 dollars-they simply add to all the the junk in the area, thats for sure"}
{"text":"the corned beef is pretty darn good but the pastrami is just absolutely TERRIBLE.... that being said, the place has character. and that counts for a lot, i suppose..."}
{"text":"This is the best Reuben I have ever had. I have been to New York, and tried several Reuben sandwiches in my life and Slyman's just slaughters them. I have tried both the corned beef and pastrami and I gotta say, I like the pastrami more. It was SOO good that I just ate at Aladdin's Eatery an hour ago and I am already salivating thinking about Slyman's. The pastrami almost tastes caramelized and has such a rich deep flavor. Sauerkraut was super good and the bread is perfect. If you go during peak lunch hours (11:30-close) expect a wait. But, the line is fast even if it is super long. Workers are a bit no non-sense but very sincere. Definitely has a New York vibe to it. Luckily for us, it is in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Jam packed, but the wait was not long for a table. TONS of meat on the sandwich, definitely had leftovers. Got the fries with a side of gravy to pair with the reuben."}
{"text":"It's like Disneyland!  You travel too far, pay too much, stand in line too long.

BUT, the food will take your tastebuds for the ride of their life and YOU WILL BE BACK FOR MORE.

Show respect for a family that is dedicated to preparing a delicious sandwich and the thrill of fearing being bounced while you order.

Side note: having only seen a mile high pile of meat with bread earmuffs on TV, I never understood how a sandwich could exist!  That's because the best part of this sandwich IS the meat.  Why hide it with salad toppings.

Eat, enjoy, get on with your day."}
{"text":"Hands down best corned beef in the country, someone prove me wrong!

First time I went, I had heard so much about it but I ordered the Pastrami, the waitress looked at me and said, \"you ever been here before\", I replied, \"no, first time\", she said \"you'll have the corned beef\" and walked away.  Thanks lady, you made my world!

So here's a trick, you can get a sandwich for 8 or 9 bucks and sit in a cramped table and buy drinks and tip, blah blah.  Or you can get a \"box of shavings\" for 5 or 6 bucks, that you can take home and make 3 or 4 good sized sammies yourself.  Its the stuff that falls to the side of the carver, its a little fattier but the overall quality nullifies that."}
{"text":"I love Brent's Deli in Los Angeles so it's hard for me to be completely fare. I ordered a \"small meat\" Ruben and it was barley warm and it had 1 Tablespoon of sauerkraut on it. I also ordered a small amount of pastrami so I could try it. For 4.00 it was about 3 bites. I am not exaggerating at all. The potato pancakes we very good. I will come back and try one more time, service was great. Yvonne was my waitress and she was super nice and helped me order. She told me to try the potato pancakes.  I didn't complain because so many people like this place. The Asst. Manager came over to me as I was typing my review and asked how I liked my dinner. I told him and he offered me another Ruben and I said no thank you. He asked me to wait a minute and came back with a free ticket for another Ruben. It turns out they were training a new cook and they are still training him. I hope to give them a higher rating next time I am here. Nice people who work here."}
{"text":"Dude place is awesome, that is all I can say.  This is a Cleveland classic and must \"go to\" place to eat!  The Corned Beef is the best in the planet.  The service is great, everyone is super nice.  Check it out when you are in Cleveland next!"}
{"text":"Really yummy Pastrami Reuben! Huge portions -- had to split one. Got the crinkle fries, which were not bad."}
{"text":"Amazing corned beef sandwiches, so much meat you have to take some out~! :) Crowded and the dine-in experience is.. not awesome, but totally worth it. Pickles are delish!"}
{"text":"Second time to Cleveland and second time to Slyman's.  Had my first corned beef sandwich here which has ruined me for life as the others just can't compare.  The sandwiches aren't cheap at around $15 but considering the size, quality and how much meat is included, they are a good value.  My wife and I split a sandwich.  On this visit we opted for a 1/2 corned beef 1/2 pastrami sandwich.  Although they are known for their corned beef I loved the pastrami.  Very unique flavor, it had a strong herb flavor that I could not specifically pick out.  It's probably clove, cinnamon or star anise."}
{"text":"Slyman's have the most amazing sandwiches ever.  Corned beef with swiss and horseradish on rye is the most perfect sandwich ever.  The corned beef is so tender, lean, juicy, and flavorful.  I cannot find anywhere that even compares to it."}
{"text":"I've had some good corned beef in my time, but this seriously blew my mind.

My boyfriend and I stopped in here on a roadtrip from NYC to IL. Upon entering, we noticed how ridiculously large the sandwiches were and decided to split one for lunch. I have been daydreaming about that sandwich ever since....

The corned beef was tender and moist and the taste was absolutely amazing, everything about this sandwich was just right. There are condiments on the table, but I didn't want to add anything at all to my corned beef and change it's amazing flavor.

If you're in the area, please do yourself a favor and stop by here. Living in NYC I have had sandwiches from some amazing delis, but nothing has compared to this. Also, I recommend ordering a plain corned beef sandwich, they also offer things like reubens, but I feel that adding anything on top of that amazing meat would almost be a sin!

So glad we stopped in, and I wish this place were close  to home!!!"}
{"text":"One badass Reuben sandwich is all I can say.   No way was I getting this one in my mouth.   Lean corned beef stacked so highly had to eat it within fork.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"A must visit venue. The corned beef is just fantastic,  the sandwich is massive in size, yet very moist and flavorful. Best in town"}
{"text":"This place is legit! First of all I appreciated the fact that they have a decent amount of seating so for a Wednesday around 10:30 5 of us were able to just sit down. By the time we left... Completely different story! After eating breakfast here, I totally get why it was packed when we left! (I promise I will get to the corned beef soon). The service was pretty good. The women must have been working there forever and they really are excited to see people come in. We got our food super fast and had as much coffee available to us that we could ever want. The menu was pretty basic, but let's face it we were all there for one thing and one thing only. They had other breakfast and lunch items if you are the one person in Cleveland that doesn't like corned beef. 

When first looking through the menu I thought the corned beef prices were pretty high, and then I saw what they gave you and it all made sense. The sandwiches are HUGE! No one actually needs that much food but this corned beef basically melts in your mouth so I can totally see how people eat it all! I ordered a corned beef breakfast sandwich with corned beef, egg, and Swiss cheese, of course in rye bread. So good!  Our table also ordered the corned beef hash with eggs. Also amazing! 

This was totally worth the trip. If you are a corned beef fan you MUST come here. It is worth the drive downtown! You will leave happy and with a full belly!"}
{"text":"Where else can you carry out one sandwich order and realize you have lunch for two when you unwrap it.  So what do you do about it... go back the next week.  The Ruben is my favorite and would suggest it over the ham and cheese and not bother to add fries.  Saint Patrick's day is just around the corner, and the line will be too."}
{"text":"Had to give the original a try after the less-than-stellar experience at the new location in Independence.  Breakfast yesterday was exactly what I was looking for.

Good food, good prices, and the right kind of friendly atmosphere that will get me coming back for more.  Trying the corned beef here made me realize there was a difference in flavor between here at the Tavern location in Independence.  The Tavern serves up leaner beef with less flavor than the original who has the right mixture of everything necessary for the perfect breakfast compliment.

Looking forward to coming back here again soon!"}
{"text":"For years I've wanted to come to Cleveland and see the Rock N Roll Hall Of Fame and eat lunch at the famous Slyman's Deli. This past week (Thursday-Sunday) I finally made a mark on my bucket list along with a few other stops our server Candace from Slyman's told us about on Friday. My husband and I came in and I had a Reuben and some barley soup he had a Combination pastrami/corned beef melt along with some onion rings. The whole meal was delicious, hands down the best sandwich I've ever had. Our server CANDACE was by far the sweetest and most knowledgeable server we've ever had traveling, she's an amazing waitress and was the cherry on top of an amazing lunch. She recommended a few other spots in Cleveland my husband Mike and I went to and loved.  Thank you again Ms Candace you should be commended for an outstanding job. YOU ROCK DEAR. If and when we return to Cleveland we'll be back for an excellent lunch and hope to see our favorite tour guide Candace.

{"text":"Been going here for years and the corned beef is the best around!!!nobody comes close"}
{"text":"Always my go to lunch spot in the area!

The service is fast! The food is great! And th staff is friendly. What more could you ask for?

Gotta get the corned beef!"}
{"text":"Always have to make a stop when I'm back home!! Nothing comes close to Slyman's in. Phoenix, Arizona!"}
{"text":"So I must be the only person who goes to Slyman's and doesn't get the corned beef, I'm not a big red meat fan so I went there with my family who do love red meat, and got the turkey melt.  It was pretty darn good. I mean how can you not love grilled bread, copious amounts of meat and melted cheese.  The coleslaw was also very good.  The fries were nothing special but hit the spot.  I have to say that the best thing about the place was the staff, they were all very friendly and handled the loads of people pouring in super fast and organized.  I would go back and maybe even get the beef!"}
{"text":"I ordered the corned beef sandwich and saved half the meat for corned beef hash the next morning. Phenomenal. I'm drooling just thinking about it. Can't wait to go back and try their Reuben."}
{"text":"I have been going here since I can remember with my family. This place is amazing and their sandwiches are impeccable! You have got to try the corn beef as it is simply out of this world and the quantity you get with what you pay is outstanding. I now live in LA but every time I travel back to my home state I have to travel to the east side of Cleveland to indulge in Slyman's! Not to mention this place has been owned by the same owners for 60+ years!! It is definitely a staple of Cleveland :)"}
{"text":"CORNED BEEF PERFECTION!  I have lived in New York City and sought out the best deli corned beef sandwich and not one of the infamous New York establishments can compete with Slyman's.  On top of that, this place epitomizes the soul of Cleveland.  I just love this place for that.  I usually run away from celebrity status establishments (especially from annoying Rachel Ray) but I have been coming here well before they discovered it.  If you consider yourself a true Clevelander than you must come here."}
{"text":"This place is hands down THE BEST place for corned beef in Cleveland! The meat is tender & juicy. It's not salty like how some other restaurants corned beef sandwiches are. The sandwich is big enough to feed 2 people so, you get your money's worth for sure. 

If you want corned beef, come to Slyman's!"}
{"text":"Every bite of my ginormous Reuben was satisfying...I only ate half knowing that eating the other half  might kill my food buzz.    I didn't even want to wolf it down...I was compelled to savor every bite.   No gimmicks or marketing tricks needed at this joint....it's the real deal.    It's pricey for lunch...$35.00 for two people with one side each, but so often you pay less for mediocracy...it was well earned.   I wish it was in my neighborhood...but alas, in my neighborhood I only have corporate chains that are mostly hype and no substance."}
{"text":"I found this review and couldn't agree with it more: \" Do you have Negative Stars Worst Deli Exp. of my life WAY OVER PRICED $36.00 for two hamburgers and fries for lunch WTF?and crappy service, its like Jewish Deli meets Disnyland with crappy food and Jesus propaganda. Nothinhg like the real Slymans a little advice people dont want to hear about John the babtist in a jewish deli. Stop the nonsence and just try to make a good sandwich\"

Again, not my words, but it 100% shares my opinion."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best corn beef sandwiches I've ever had. This review doesn't need to be long! Go here get the corn beef, side of fries and be happy. My wife got the turkey and son ate the grilled cheese. Both of them were just as happy with their choices. 
We went on a Friday around lunch and the line was out the door. But the line moves fast and a short wait to get a table. The place is small and very popular so I assume whenever you go it will be busy. It's a little pricey but you get what you pay for. If you're in Cleveland for a visit you must find time to check it out. If you live around here and haven't been, go today!"}
{"text":"Whoa - first off - the bathroom is filthy and makes me wonder about the kitchen. What a turnoff! Yes the sandwich was large, but not much taste. Not sure what the big deal is about this place. The owner was rude to us too so, needless to say - not going back."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  That's all I can say. The food is delicious here. My husband had the corned beef hash and I had a corned beef sandwich with egg. The thousand island dressing was the best I've ever had. Must be homemade. Service was top notch. We loved this place."}
{"text":"Best Corned Beef in town. Hands down. Even for the price it's worth it. Recommend making the establishment more roomier. Sucks having to wait in line for carry-out in CLE weather because of the line. Recommend if your looking for get carry out, get there at 11a at the latest."}
{"text":"Best. Ruben. Ever. 
No joke, it's worth every penny. Split it with a friend cause it's big enough. Staff was all warm, friendly, and welcoming. Hubs had a BLT and said it was great, too. You won't be disappointed . Even my kids said it was amazing. My six year old tried to help me finish my Ruben, but there was no way. I brought home leftovers so I can savor it again soon."}
{"text":"Holy MEAT batman!!
I grew up in CLE, I just moved back 4 year's ago. I've been told by many that I needed a sammich from Slymins. 

Well, I've finally gone and OMG!! This is most definitely going to be a monthly thing. 

Meat, with a side of meat and a little bit of more meat. Man, I'm glad I'm back at the Gym. 
Hands down, best sandwich in town. Definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"It's Slyman's... If you don't know how amazing this place is, shame on you. Nothing further needs to be said."}
{"text":"One of the best deli restaurants I have ever dined at. Prices were a bit high but that's what you get for 30 lbs worth of roast beef!"}
{"text":"Hands down best corned beef I've ever had. There's no where in Florida that's has a place just like this. Slyman's offers severals other sandwiches other than corned beef like BLT's, hot or cold turkey sandwiches but if you're going here corned beef is the meat of choice! You can have it on any kind of bread, but you should probably have it on rye. I got the Ruben with the sauerkraut on the side because I saw how much meat comes on the sandwich. In addition to your sandwich you get a delicious house made deli pickle. If you feel like you need more food ( I was feeling fat) you can order sides like crinkle fries or house made potato salad. Simply excellent."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Slyman's! It definitely lived up to expectations, the corned beef was sooo good.  I split a Reuben sandwich and fries with a friend and left satisfied and happy.  They PILE on the meat. At $14 the sandwiches are a little steep but I guess they do give you a ton of meat. The service was friendly and super quick. 

It's been hard for me to make it out there because it was only open M-F during lunch times, but when I went I noticed they have Saturday hours too now. Yay!!"}
{"text":"A Cleveland staple: the corned beef sandwich from this place! A must for tourists!"}
{"text":"I know they are known for their corned beef (which is really good as well) but I had the pastrami sandwich  with cheese on toasted bread w/mustard and it was OFF THE HOOK! Best pastrami I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Best corn beef ever!  Corn beef from any other place, even New York City cannot stack up to Slymans. Also Slymans has been consistently satisfying for over 30 years for me. Same people slicing meat and taking orders. Same smiles and great personalities. I love that place. I've watched the family grow old and still maintain high efficiency and service.  You can't find better corn beef anywhere!"}
{"text":"WHAT not much to say but Sit down and eat.  By far the best Reuben ever  (and i am not a reuben kinda guy) 

The owner Freddy greeted me warmly and ask if take a seat.  My waitresses was amazing, ordering was simple menu is easy to navigate and the focus on what they do best   corned beef   

Later that night I'm at a different restaurant and Bamn it's Freddy, and guess what he remembers me ..that was amazing   

Freddy and staff keep up the good work, keep it family and make people smile"}
{"text":"Best corned beef ever, been eating here every chance I get for 35 yrs or so. Used to be often when I worked in town. Now it's a special stop, always worth it. Never been disappointed except with the wait sometimes, lol wish they were open later."}
{"text":"Best spot for corned beef in Cleveland. My personal favorite is the BBQ beef. I've been eating here for a long time (at least 15 years) and I've never had anything to complain about. If you've never been you should go."}
{"text":"The term \"best\" is thrown around too much. Everyone's guilty of using it too liberally, myself included. Typically, something one person thinks is the \"best\", another person might not. When it comes down to it, the term is usually debatable and not a fact.

With that said, from this day forward, I will be more careful when I use the word in the future, for I had a life changing experience today.....

I just had THE BEST corned beef ever. I can see how other past claims can be debated, but there is NO debate this time. This is a fact. For lunch, I had the BEST Reuben Sandwich ever at Slymans on St. Clair!

Sadly, every corned beef I have from here on out will be a disappointment of mass proportions as I really don't think anyone can top this. Tender, tasty, moist, lean, succulent. It was a heavenly experience."}
{"text":"Have been getting the CB sandwiches and Reubens here for 30 years, and there is none better in Cleveland. Of course they do cost a bit more, but they give you extra slices of rye bread with your takeout CB. The potato salad is great too."}
{"text":"Incredible sandwiches!  Be ready to eat...a lot!  What's not to love about a side of crinkle cut fries?"}
{"text":"Complaint:generic frozen fries. I mean when you make the bread which is amazing. And you make and slice the corned beef, which was the best I've ever had, why put no effort in the fries. Basically the only other menu item. But really it's a small complaint because really you're going for the bread and meat."}
{"text":"Amazing! I shared this sandwich and we still couldn't finish it. Turkey and pastrami on rye with Swiss!"}
{"text":"I've been chasing the taste of this corned beef all over the country, ever since I moved from Cleveland. I just cant believe that four years later, im still ordering corn beef all over Chicago trying to recreate that Slymans feeling only to be disappointed every time."}
{"text":"Slymans has great corned beef, don't get me wrong, it's the location that brings in the crowds.  But if you truly want the best corned beef in Cleveland and don't mind driving out of the city, then go to goodman's. The true clevelander knows this jem."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about Slyman's for years - and never made it over. I was determined to rectify that during my last trip to Cleveland.

I stopped in for lunch one cool, misty, rainy afternoon around 1:30 pm. The place was packed to the gills. I decided not to wait for a table to open up - so I waited in line to place an order to go - the wait was not long.

I ordered a Corned Beef on Rye - (comes with Swiss cheese) and some sort of mustard (not yellow) and mayo. Plus a dill pickle spear.

I took it back to my hotel to eat - I could not wait to dig in!

Lean corned beef was sliced razor thin and piled high! It was Oh so tender and succulent! I could only eat half the sandwich and saved the other half for later!

Wow! Can't wait to come back and try more Corned Beef sandwich variants! And I need to come back for breakfast to try their version of Corned Beef Hash - made with real Slymans corned beef!

Excellent! Mindbending! Lifechanging!

{"text":"Sandwiches are great and big.  Line can be out the door..thats a good problem to have i guess..  If Im in the area Ill grab a pistrami to go.  Just watch on the sides, extra bread..they nickle and dime ya to death.."}
{"text":"Hands down the best corned beef in northeast Ohio by a wide margin. My friend and I got the reuben here, and the quality of the meat is definitely comparable to what you can get at Katz in NYC as other reviewers have mentioned. The portions are very big, and my friend and I had to split a sandwich and fries. It's unfortunate that this deli is only open in the mornings and afternoons, and closed on Sundays. This means I can really only go on Saturday mornings due to my work schedule. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to try top quality deli style sandwiches."}
{"text":"The Reuben was delicious.  Hot, fresh, and fast.  The employees are professional, but not friendly.  Not one smile person smiled at ME.  Even when thanking me not even eye contact.  This is the first time I've felt like I was being treated like a \"nigger\" in decades.  They were friendly with some, but not others.  I will not return.  They only get two stars because the food was on point."}
{"text":"The corned beef is good and piled high, though I don't think it's anything exceptional. I wouldn't be surprised if they use the same CB as other places. The atmosphere here really sets Slyman's apart. Looks like a little run deli in an otherwise uninviting urban industrial area, but once you get inside it's really hopping."}
{"text":"Best place to get a corned beef on rye or reuben on earth. First, each sandwich has a pile of corned beef at least 4\"  to 5\" thick. The rye is fresh and lightly toasted. The kraut is drained and not wet. The corned beef is not wet like you find at most places, so you don't have a soggy sandwich bottom. And I think there is much less fat in this than in typical corned beef, so it is better for you. The place is always packed, with a line out the door for takeout. Reuben is a bit pricy at $12, but it's worth the price (and the 740 mile drive)."}
{"text":"This is a must when \"touring\" Cleveberg, a total landmark restaurant! The place has been putting out obscenely large pastrami (and corned beef) sandwich's for years. Go if you dare but go hungry. Puts many NYC joints to shame. Ask for extra pickles you will need them."}
{"text":"I used to work around the corner from this place. I have eaten their food numerous times from working downtown. And mostly on St Patrick's Day. 
My boss took me for lunch on his birthday one year, at the beginning of December. 
The place was PACKED! Wall to wall people, elbows bumping into you and somehow we found a table. The food was amazing. Corned beef sandwich the size of your head. But it's just a small diner. I'd much rather take my food to go. Their amazing corned beef is a Cleveland staple. Great. Now I'm hungry :/ haha"}
{"text":"I'm a vegan now but in my meat eating days I loved it when my dad would randomly bring home Slyman's for dinner.  If I ever decide to eat meat again the first thing I will eat is a corned beef sandwich from Slyman's."}
{"text":"I got a little intimated when i looked at the surroundings and the front of this restaurant. Traveling alone in a strange city makes me a little nervous. But I decided to man up and give it a try. Wow!  Had the Reuben and fell in love just a little bit. That corned beef was awesome. And the thousand island that came in a squeeze bottle, yummy!
16.00 for a sandwich isn't cheap, but I wrapped up half and had it for dinner!"}
{"text":"In the mood for a GIANT corned beef sandwich? this is the place to go. sure they have other things, but if you're going to slyman's corned beef is a must. complement the gigantic sandwich of delicious, tender corned beef with a side of potato salad or french fries. a lot of times there is a line out the door, but its usually for take out, so find out before getting deterred!"}
{"text":"I got pretty lucky...was able to get here before the lunch rush.  Arrived at 11:30, first time at Slyman's.  Greeted with a smile by the host and was asked \"dine in or take out?\".  I said dine out, and he directed me to the counter, right under the sign for take out orders.  ordered a corned beef sandwich, and was asked what I wanted on it.  Ordered it with everything: cheese, horseradish, mustard (but no mayo).  Slid down the counter to pay at the register.  As soon as I paid, the guy behind the counter handed me my sandwich...all in all it took about 3 minutes from ordering to paying to receiving the goods.  After hearing that this place can get lines out the door..I was pretty shocked how quickly and smoothly it went.  

Now the food: man..it is exactly what everyone says and what the pictures look like...its a PILE of meat.  The corned beef had good flavor, and was balanced well with the mustard and horseradish (I should have asked for a little more horseradish..i like it spicy!)  Taking a bite into the sandwich, and I couldn't fit it all in my mouth.  The half sandwich is almost as tall as it is wide.  It came with two large pickles that essentially amounted to a full pickle.  Will definitely need to come back here when I have enough time to drive over for lunch."}

{"text":"Everytime I am in their area, a stop at Slymans is in order. The best and biggest corned beef sandwich I have ever had. They are a bit pricey but if you want the best, you have to pay for it. Freddie always made a good \"Swiss Miss\" for me."}
{"text":"Awesome meat. Just got a big 1lb stack and some meat to go, makes for a great lunch. 

Pickles are nice there and it's got a good selection. Just wish they had longer operating hours! I'm never able to get there in time"}
{"text":"I saw a man pick up a Slyman's sandwich too fast and the shift of weight made him so top heavy he tipped right off his chair and onto the floor. Despite his recent plunge, the man laid on his back, clearly enjoying his sandwich. OK! OK! That didn't happen, but if you've been, one could certainly imagine. 

When you walk into Slyman's, it's evident they've been around for a while. I sorta feel like I'm in the 70's. That's a good thing by the way. You get that feeling that not a lot has changed inside here. Their also clearly popular, as there's a flow of people coming in and out of here and there's either a line by the counter and majority of the tables are full. 

The food is quite simple. Corned Beef or Pastrami is the way to go, but I want to try their Roast Beef next time I visit. You can enjoy these gigantic sandwiches in a multitude of ways, share with a friend, tear it all up if your hungry, or even separate the bread immediately and bring the components of the sandwich home with you. 

The sandwiches are delicious. They've even got breakfast that I'd be interested in giving a shot. On my last visit, the service was superb. Greeted nicely, our server was funny and provided just the right amount of conversation. 

Slyman's offers up some of the biggest and tastiest sandwiches in the Cleve."}
{"text":"Not a corned beef fan...So why the 4 stars you ask?  EVERYONE that is a corned beef fan that I know, loves them some Slyman's and as a Corned Beef Hater, I am still able to come here and eat their Tuna Melt (very good and gigantic)."}
{"text":"This was our last stop on our way out of town and was the highlight of the one day trip.  Split a corned beef, because neither of us was hungry,  All we did was eat here. I wish I'd had one to myself. One of the best sandwiches ever. Weighs in at a heft $14 bucks too, but unlike most other $15 sandwiches I've had, this one was worth it."}
{"text":"The Reuben is one of my favorite foods in the whole world, and this place does the sandwich justice. A cleveland staple."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best corned beef in Cleveland. Sandwiches are so big, you can make a couple sandwiches out of the amount of corned beef packed in it.  The corned beef is very lean.  I like coming to this place at least once a month.  The slicers are non stop cutting the briskets.

Best to get there before 11:30 AM for dine in or take out so you don't have to wait in a long line."}
{"text":"As a long time sandwich lover and Cleveland resident, why was this past Wednesday the first time I've ever been here!? Forget trying to impress me with sushi dates, take me here!! I love a good reuben. If anything at all my sandwich could have had more sauerkraut to even out the meat ratio. And with a sandwich so big it was hard to get sauerkraut, meat, cheese, and thousand island dressing in one bite (since they separate the cheese&dressing from the  sauerkraut by putting the meat in the middle). Prepare to OPEN WIDE!!!"}
{"text":"I am a Slymans devotee and recently someone asked me to join them for breakfast there. I did not know they served breakfast; what a pleasant surprise. Naturally I had to order the corned beef hash. Theirs is the best I have had. In fact, I have been there several times since and keep ordering the same thing. One day I will try something different. It's a little pricier than most places ($12.00 vs $8 or 9) but I don't mind paying for good service and a hearty meal. Beware, you cannot leave the tip on your credit card so have a few bucks with you. I'd recommend Slymans to anyone for lunch or breakfast. They have the best corned beef you will ever eat."}
{"text":"Thinking about flying back home to Cleveland JUST to get my Slyman's on.  But alas, my fat ass is off to work instead.  Have a corned beef day, bitches."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  You better know what you want if you are ordering at the counter.  Kind of reminds me of the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld.  If you sit down to eat, it's great because you sit with complete strangers, but everyone chat's as if you've known them forever.  We were there with our 2 kids and sat with 2 construction workers, a lawyer, a doctor, and a truck driver.  Fantastic conversations!  One construction worker had been coming here forever.  The waitress didn't even asked what he wanted, she knew.

As for the sandwiches ... amazing.  so so so good."}
{"text":"They have by far the best corned beef sandwiches that I have ever had in my lifetime.  They are big and juicy!!! Definitely hit the spot and they were so generous with the portion that I got to have left overs for dinner time or tomorrow's lunch!! I was so satisfied and will always recommend this place to people."}
{"text":"I ate only part of my sandwich and was so full..... I saved the rest of it for dinner later.

Compared to a Reuben sandwich I had in NYC, I like the corned beef better at the deli in NYC (Katz's Deli) but at Slyman's, they prepare the sandwich as a whole better.

At the NYC deli, the focus seemed to be on preparing really good corned beef and then letting the other ingredients play purely a subsidiary role.  At Slyman's, each ingredient in the sandwich melded together very nicely to make an uber tasty sandwich, from the grilled bread and the perfectly melted cheese to the seemingly mile-high pile o' meat in the sandwich.  I also like how they supply great horseradish to go with your order if you so desire.  The only nit picky thing I would say I wish my sandwich had more of was some more of the sauerkraut that goes with a Reuben sandwich.  Other than that everything was perfect.

Plus, service here is very warm and friendly.  I'll definitely come here again when I can."}
{"text":"OoooohWEE! Definitely one of the best corned beef sammiches I've ever had in...life. I'm from Cleveland, and Cleveland does some *mean* corned beef which is why I've never been inclined to try Slyman's and succumb to all the hype. (Why? When I can get a drool-worthy CB sammich from a dozen places, including gas stations, in my own 'hood?!)

However, I must admit this is THEE best. My humongo sandwich was $11 and I would pay double for it. Easy.

The meat: so, so moist, with the perfect amount of fat. Totally kills other delis where the meat tends to be TOO lean or kinda dry (e.g. Corky and Lenny's/Barristers).

I order my CBs this way: Reuben NO sauerkraut with mayo AND mustard and swiss (melted). An employee there confirms this is indeed one of the best ways to order:) Try it. Delish.

I always say that the Cleveland corned beef sandwich HAS TO be one of the best sandwiches in the WORLD. So I guess maybe Slyman's is one of the best sandwich shops in the world?

Plus, the place is SO \"Cleveland.\" You just have to know, to know."}
{"text":"Ah Cleveland, you've got a terribly run basketball team, but excellent corned beef. Things could be worse. Slymans gives you an overwhelming amount of excellent corned beef and I thought my breakfast plate of corned beef, a scrambled egg, hashbrowns, and rye was really excellent.  The star is obviously the beef, but the crisp edges on the hashbrowns are exemplary. If only the actual browns controlled the edges as well (i think that makes sense).

Go dubs."}
{"text":"The corn beef is right up there with the best deli's in New York. Even with the monstrous sandwiches they give you, you will be left wanting more. The Pastrami and the Reuben's are also exceptional. This is a must visit spot in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Best corned beef I've EVER had EVER! So juicy and delicious. The bread is fantastic. The staff is super funny and engaging. Cleveland staple. Had to stop here one more time before flying back to California."}
{"text":"Love! Can't wait to be back in Ohio to get some more!!! Portions are huge! By far the best corned beef I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Philadelphia has the cheese steak, but locals argue between two spots.  Cleveland has the Corned Beef Reuben, and there is an undisputed champion.  Slymans also has fantastic Roast Beef (while it lasts).

There's a reason presidents, entertainers and anyone else visiting Cleveland stops here for a sandwich.  Stop by... I bet you'll need a doggy bag."}
{"text":"corned beef and breakfast
but don't get the pastrami
pastrami sadness

Well, Slymans does do a solid corned beef sandwich, but it does not even come close to Mister Brisket's.  The pastrami at Slymans though...  it is wretched.  I've had generic turkey pastrami from a supermarket deli that was better.  C'mon Slyman...

Carry on ...and avoid the pastrami."}
{"text":"Incomparable Corned Beef!
Slyman's has the best corned beef in town, hands down! The dining area in the restaurant is very small and don't be surprised if you're seated next to another customer once in a while. Once you've had the food, you'll understand why this place is so popular during the lunch rush. Most of their business is for pick up orders. Sandwiches are expensive, but enormous and delicious. Give this place a try and you'll understand the meat-eating, sandwich-driven demographic of Cleveland, OH."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Slyman's. I wanted to come to this place as soon as I looked for places to eat on my trip to Cleveland. And it didn't disappoint! We got take out. 2 corned beef, a roast beef, and a turkey melt. They were all delicious and definitely more than enough for one person to eat! 
I stopped around lunch time and was surprised with how fast I was in and out. There was a decent take out line and the restaurant was full. As busy as it was, it was quick and easy. I also like that they gave us some extra bread to split the humongous sandwiches in half.
Quick and easy service, and tasty food. What more can you ask for!? I'll definitely be back my next time in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Was overpriced purchased Ruben looked up prices on website not what I paid slower service. Cashier  wasn't pleasant ,had to ask for condiments. Called to let management know first thing he said our website is up to date .Then of course I was the first person to say the meat was not that moist and the slither of cheese not slice was what my sandwich had. Just overall bad experience. And Management couldn't accept criticism."}
{"text":"One of the Best Reuben sandwiches in the USA, bar none!! Lunch is always packed because if you want a reuben for 3 in one sandwich, this is where to get it!! I'm cursed w living in Omaha at the moment & the reubens here are about 1/5 the size of Slyman's & get this, made with Wonder Rye bread!!! UGG!!! So when ever I'm in Cleveberg you'll find me here at Slyman's! One Great Feedhall!!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches as big as your head, with more flavor than you can even imagine. Get the corned beef, it's what they're known for. 

I'm lame and I don't like corned beef, so I usually get their turkey rueben, which is equally as gigantic and delicious.

If you get fries, add gravy. It's delish. And if you come during the lunch rush, expect to wait for a table or take out."}
{"text":"Fall apart, delicious, melt in your mouth corned beef. With over 200 reviews, it hardly seems necessary for me to confirm what's already been said....but I'm going to anyways. So. Damn. Good."}
{"text":"Ask any Clevelander about Slyman's and they'll just smile. This sandwich shop isn't much to look at BUT that ain't what this place is about. They're about giving you the best dam sandwiches around and they deliver! If you got a hunkerin for corned beef on rye don't hesitate to stop in and grab one, BUT WAIT!! You'll be needing both hands for one of these delicious sandwiches so be careful and enjoy!!Cheers!"}
{"text":"The Flagship by which all other deli's outside of NYC are judged. Slyman's is so good you'd think you were in NYC. Slyman's is the one deli that could hold its own against places like Katz's and others with bigger profiles and reputations."}
{"text":"My wife and I were traveling from the Pittsburgh area to go to the Progressive International Motorcycle Show and we have seen this restaurant on TV several times and had to try it out for ourselves. We told our waitress Candy that we were traveling from out of town to the motorcycle show. She told us that there was 3/4s of a pound of meat on all of there sandwiches, and she was not kidding. The corned beef was so tasty. It just melted in your mouth. This is what corned beef should be. Whenever I am anywhere close to here in Ohio I will be stopping here again. We ended up taking half of our sandwiches home with us. It is just as good heated back up too.  Our waitress also gave us a special code to buy our tickets online with our smart phones to save us $5.00 per ticket for the motorcycle show. Good deal. Great food. Nice road trip. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've never actually gone to the Slyman's restaurant, so I can only account for the food, not for the service or any other aspect. My boyfriend occasionally brings it home with him from work and I get to enjoy it as well. If you like corned beef, you'll love Slyman's. If you think you hate corned beef, you'll also love Slyman's. HUGE portions of corned beef on rye bread with Swiss cheese on top? Need I say more? One sandwich is enough for the two of us to be slightly uncomfortably full after eating for dinner. I usually add a little stadium or spicy brown mustard and am in heaven. I definitely recommend it, but he aware of their hours (open until 2:30). I've had quite a few friends try to go only to find that they are closed."}
{"text":"Slymans is one of the greatest places the staff is very inviting and friendly they ate also very religious based the first time I ever had them was through take out and it was love at first bite I usually get the cornbeef with cheese and extra thousand island dressing very delicious I also suggest that you get a side of fries they are a Lil on the expensive side but who cares because it is just that good mmmmmm also the fries are wonderful they have plenty of other choices though if your not a cornedbeef fan but definitely a must try if yiu are ever in the area."}
{"text":"Solid 4 because its a staple in Cleveland as THE place to go for Corned Beef!!  I love it that people line up out the door for this stuff.  I thought it was really good when I stopped in there, HUGE to say the least.  Hint, if your going to eat inside, bypass the line, its for take out.  I found out the hard way by standing in line for 20 minutes...ha ha.

I love the soup nazi photo, no corned beef for you!!  I actually called there once to get find out the weekend hours and talked to the owner.  What a nice fella!  He was very helpful and we actually got to talking for about 20 minutes cause I was new to the area and he gave me the run down on Cleveland.

I will always recommend this place for lunch downtown....top notch.  For comparable corned beef, try Croagh Patrick's in Willoughby on Robinhood Dr.  

I'll stop writing now so you can go get your corned beef on."}
{"text":"BEST corned beef ever. Melts in your mouth. Also tried chicken noodle soup, great and fries with gravy. Sandwiches huge so think about sharing"}
{"text":"Ugh! What is the deal with the whole city of Cleveland (or at least the West Side and downtown) going krazy over Slyman's?! This is absolutely the worst corned beef I have ever eaten in my life. I've been enjoying corned beef and deli food since I was a kid, and I've had enough to know what's good and what's crap- and Slyman's, sorry Cleveland, is crap. The famous corned beef is greasy beyond belief- it soaked through my take home bag! The barbecue brisket sandwich was a  joke: dry tough beef slices slathered with bottled bland BBQ sauce. You have to share your table with other customers, due to the limited seating in the tiny restaurant. Not for me. You wait in line forever to pay your bill, which just makes everything worse. Its a very popular place especially with working stiffs from the surrounding industrial neighborhood. 


You want real, good corned beef? Go to Goodman's at Pearl and Brookpark Rds. Of course there is always Corky and Lenny's. Slyman's is the favorite deli of gentiles who have never had real delicatessen food. Too bad."}
{"text":"Perfect place to go if you're looking for - huge sandwich that you'll never finish. Typically my coworkers and I will order a sandwich each and split the fries. The meat of course is the reason I come here--- you can't go weong with their turkey or Reuben. Expect a line every day. This is not an in-n-out spot unless you call ahead of time with your order. Worth the $9 for your sandwich."}
{"text":"Oh my god- Can I say lunch exceeded our expectations if we had no idea what to expect??   It was possibly the BEST corned beef sandwich we've had--ever!  The staff is fun and efficient!  Loved the hustle bustle feel at lunch !  I wood give 6 stars if I could!!"}
{"text":"I don't even LIKE corned beef!  Or at least I didn't until Slyman's.

Had the most amazing corned beef ruben when I was visiting C-Town this week.  The meat was lean and juicy and warm.  Yum.  If all you've ever had is dry, fatty corned beef, give it another go at Slyman's.  Also had the potato pancakes which were awesome and served with sides of apple sauce and sour cream.  The potato salad was nothing special so just save room for those enormous sammies.

Staff was friendly, we were seated quickly at 1pm on a wednesday.  It's small and cozy inside but very clean and inviting.  We saw tons of people getting orders to go at the counter as well."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I couldn't wait to visit Slyman's and devour some of their corned beef... and was not at all disappointed. It was the best (and largest, by far) Reuben I have every had. Seriously, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Our experience was fantastic and I fell in love with the casual feel of this neighborhood joint. Service was great, ridiculously fast, and everyone was super friendly. This will definitely be a stop any time I visit Cleveland."}
{"text":"I chose to go to Slymann's Sandwich shop and when I saw the long line of locals outside the facility I knew I was at the right place. Unfortunately for me I don't like Corned Beef which is their specialty, I went for their 2nd best sandwich which is the Roast Beef.  

I ended up taking the monstrosity they call a sandwich \"to go\" and ate it as we rushed over to Progressive Field which is the home of the Indians. The sandwich meat was fresh and tasted similar in texture and the way it was cut to D'Allesandro's cheesteaks from Philly. I thought the sandwich was very good but I think the size of the sandwich is why people like it for the most part. I kind of regret not trying the corned beef even though I'm not a corned beef fan. The person taking my order gave me the same disappointed look the waitress from earlier in the trip gave me when I didn't take her advice."}
{"text":"Expect a line when you go, but totally worth the wait, and service is great. The corned beef is the best of ever had and the portion sizes are large and appropriate. I recommend dining on for the full experience. You will share your dining experience with a wide range of people - sex, race and age."}
{"text":"Went here for an early lunch based on suggestion from a friend and Yelp.  Arrived around 11:30, found parking in lot, and was greeted and seated immediately.  Server stopped by, dropped of menu and took my drink order.  The non-breakfast menu appears to be limited to a good variety of deli sandwiches and 3-4 dinner plates.  They only had one soup (chicken noodle).  I opted for a bowl of soup, a corned beef sandwich and side of slaw.  The soup was brought out quickly and was nice and hot (welcome on a 2 degree day).  The soup had a nice broth and plenty of noodles with a few chunks of chicken.  While I was eating my soup a line for take out was building up and was out the door by noon.  My sandwich arrived a few minutes after I finished my soup and it was huge with 1/2 a pickle and my side of slaw.  The corned beef was hot, had a great flavor, was tender and still lean.  The slaw was good but nothing special and the rye bread was ok.  I would put the corned beef up against some of the best I have had.  The service was solid.  My bill was $21 but the sandwich was big enough to split if you pick up another side."}
{"text":"I posted a close-up of my sandwich on Facebook with a caption \"Now this is a corned beef sandwich bitches!\"

Again, I ordered extra bread and my sandwich magically became 3 sandwiches. Boom!

Slyman's is a must have if you are in Cleveland for any reason."}
{"text":"If there is a more famous foodie destination in Cleveland, I don't know about it. People all over the country have heard of this Mecca of all things corned beef. Sitting Presidents have come here. Actors, musicians, and other famous people have also strolled through its doors for one of their mammoth sandwiches. This review is straight forward as this is a straight forward place with a simplistic menu. Corned beef sandwiches. Built with a metric ton of hot, buttery corned beef on two slices of rye. You also get extra bread to make more sandwiches if you can't handle it one setting, which is a monumental task that probably requires an entire day of fasting beforehand. The sandwiches are great and come with a kosher dill pickle on the side. If you want to fill your belly with the area's best corned beef and visit a Cleveland landmark all in one visit, this is the place to go. Just make sure you have plenty of time for the food coma that is sure to follow, but you will have a giant smile on your face!"}
{"text":"By far the best corned beef sandwich in the USA."}
{"text":"omg ... that was one heck of a corned beef sandwich. I had to order an extra \"brick\" of grilled bread which balanced out the ginormous stack of meat. Meat was nice and red + tender too!

Had the sandwich delivered to the office so I didn't get to truly get the whole experience of dining in. 

Tried the soup of the day which wasn't bad, but since I'm pretty sure that Slyman's isn't going to be reading this review ... it was so freakin salty! Not sure if this is just a ploy to get us to buy more beer or water. But my goodness. 

Would definitely go back to try out some of the other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"This may be the best corned beef sandwich in the USA. It is melt in your mouth tender, with an excellent flavor. 

The sandwich itself must have a half pound of corned beef on it. Its enough to make four sandwiches...but why would you? Because once you have a bite you won't be able to stop eating it. The sandwich is so big that you will not need a side dish to go with it. 

$14 for a sandwich seems steep until you have one. Then you realize that it is worth the price.

Expect long lines and limited seating during the lunch rush. Slymans is well known and it will be packed. 

As far as a corned beef sandwiches go, this is as good as it can get. So much so that a president has eaten here."}
{"text":"I stopped here last fall while visiting Cleveland for a Browns football game. I have forever been a corned beef fan and when my mother would visit me in Florida on her long drive from Shaker Heights she would bring me several pounds of corned beef with her.

This is the best anywhere!!

I can only tell you about the corned beef sandwich - it is all I order . I make sure when I fly in that I have enough time to get here before it closes. Otherwise - I change my incoming flight!

I don't even set myself up for disappointment by eating it somewhere else. I just wait until I can get the best!! 

I am 6'6 with large hands and I have to really fight to be able to hold this big boy without dropping it!

It is a meal and is sooooooo good!!!!!"}
{"text":"Classic!!  One of my favorite places on earth!!!  I'm so addicted to corned beef that I have never ventured out to try anything else.... but... what is better than their massive corned beef sandwiches?!?!?! :-)!"}
{"text":"None of my periodic trips to Cleveland are complete without a stop at Slyman's. The corned beef stands up with the best of them (and I've hit the legendary and not so legendary haunts in NYC). I've never tried the pastrami (looks too fatty for me) and can't imagine why anyone would order a burger. The portions are huge and the corned beef is lean and excellent quality. I rarely eat red meat, but when I do it has to really good, and this more than measures-up.

Avoid straight up noon, because there'll be a line for takeout or for sitdown--all despite a rapid fire, called out style of service that seems more New York than Cleveland, except for the accents, with a diverse mix of social backgrounds. It's the kind of place that brings back my own blue collar Cleveland accent and it's the kind of place that wouldn't please a lot of my snooty DC neighbors (except for the ones who complain about DC's lousy delis)."}
{"text":"As a non-corn beef lover, I was really worried to come here. However, their menu actually offers a really wide variety of options. I had the melted ham and cheese and it was pretty basic, but tasty. My husband got the corn beef and oh my goodness it was huge! He could barely finish half and completely loved every bite. 

He can't wait to take some of our friends and family back. 

Service is also super quick even though there is always a full house. Parking is easily found nearby on the streets. I'm excited to try the new one in Independence too."}
{"text":"All the way from San Jose. Born and raised in California and sorry folks, we ain't got nothin here that even comes close to this wonderful sandwich/breakfast shop in Cleveland Ohio. By far, the very best sandwich I have ever eaten and the people that own/work there are just what one would expect in Ohio, terrific."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT CORNED BEEF!  Fries are plane jane. The boss at the slicer needs to take a chill pill.  Smile buddy, life is short. It's no Carnegie Deli but it's good stuff.  Get there early for lunch as it does get busy.  Oh yeah, and the road is awful so don't drive too fast on your way to the place. =P"}
{"text":"Very good corned beef sandwiches. I would come here again, but I'm not a huge sandwich person. I've been to Katz' Delicatessen in NYC (where Harry met Sally) so this wasn't anything amazing to me."}
{"text":"Slymans is everything I'd hoped for. I have always heard about the amazing corned beef sandwiches - however could never commit to the drive. I'm glad my attitude changed. It was WELL worth it. We got there right before the lunch rush so there really wasn't a line or a wait. Pop comes in cans which immediately made me happy! There's something about a pop can that puts fountain pops to shame. Our server was prompt and efficient. It was wall to wall packed so I didn't expect much face time. Our food came out quickly. It was amazing. The sandwiches were HUGE And amazing. If you ever wondered what a REAL corned beef sandwich is supposed to taste like, this is it!!!! Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"This is a Cleveland staple for sure. 

I can't give a full review because I have only had these sandwiches show up at work when vendors buy them for us, but you really don't need one with 500 other detailed reviews. Free food is best food. 

I've never been a big fan of corned beef, but Slyman's changed my mind about it. The huge sandwich is a solid 2 meals. It's perfect with a little spicy mustard. Hopefully I get to visit the place soon because it looks like cheese and toasted bread would make for an even better meal."}
{"text":"You'll never guess what I ordered from Slyman's recently.  Nope, that's not it. I ordered a hamburger! When I ordered it on the phone, the guy on the line yelled to the cook, \"Do we still make hamburgers?\"  It was funny. Anyway, my burger was very tasty and it was only $6.00!  That's a far cry from $14.50 for corned beef. It came with lettuce, onion, and tomato and I would definitely order it again. The meat was seasoned well and it was just a yummy burger. I may order cheese, sauteed onions, and mushrooms next time.

I've had Slyman's corned beef sandwiches before and I like them, but I don't love corned beef in general. I'm a cheap non-conformist. What can I say?"}
{"text":"Recently, there have been a few new restaurants in Cleveland that have been getting dubbed as \"The Best Restaurant in the City\".  Sorry, that title has been reserved for Slyman's years ago.   Seriously, this place is LEGEND.  In a city that, unfortunately, is known for our sports team's inability to win Championships, Cleveland has a plethora of really amazing, family owned, ethnic restaurants.  Thus, competition is good, and Slyman's still is the best.  I remember being a kid and just being stunned by the size of their Reuban...i didn't know how to tackle the mountain of Corned Beef.  And even today, the size still amazes me, but size is a good thing ;) Such a huge sandwich anywhere else would be too much, but not the succulent, perfect corned beef of Slyman's.  If you live in Cleveland (or even in the entire great state of OHIO) and haven't been here yet, shame on you."}
{"text":"My family has been going to Slyman's for years but this was my first visit... it's not a good place for groups, children or the handicap but it is worth the wait. We had a table of seven and the server had a hard time accommodating us, saying that \"It's not going to happen\" and leaving us to just wait. Eventually another older woman appeared and said we can combine tables & she'd take care of us, not sure why the first guy couldn't figure this out?

If you have issues with being claustrophobic then I would avoid this place! You are definitely sitting on one another laps and the place could have been a little cleaner. The pickle that came with my sandwich was just okay, not the home made giant barrel pickle I was hoping for. Yet the corned beef had virtually no fat on it and was delicious!!! I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but I'd like to return in the near future, perhaps with a smaller group(?).  The french fires are nothing to brag about either, better than my local Wendy's but not as good as Mr. Hero's."}
{"text":"Candace was awesome! The food was awesome! Very lean corn beef on very fresh bread. My daughter had an omelet and she loved it. The hash browns were great."}
{"text":"In town visiting and was craving deli food.  Hit the jackpot with this place!!  Don't miss their corned beef.  Their fries and gravy was fantastic too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely, The BEST place in Cleveland for corned beef.   Hands down!
know that it will always be crowded so expect to wait.  it's common for the line to be out the door on the side walk on thursday and friday.  The decor is your typical old town diner that hasn't been touched in many decades... but hey that's not why we go there.   The food is AWESOME."}
{"text":"Came here on a snowy around 10:30 am. Maybe because of the snow, the restaurant was not too busy. No line for take out. Greeted with a smile by the cook. Took about a good 15 min to get the sandwich. I ordered the corned beef reuben. Tons of corned beef. I had to split the sandwich in 1/2 and ate it face up. The corned beef is super tender but a little too salty for me. Sauerkraut wasn't sour enough. Wish they could include more thousand island dressing to go. Make sure to ask as they only give one small container of sauerkraut and one small container of thousand island dressing to go. They also charge a $1 fee for orders to go. Bottom line, large sandwich, lots of meat, classic Cleveland diner. Not the best reuben I have ever had, but a must try at least once if you have lived in Cleveland for awhile."}
{"text":"What a big yummy corned beef sandwich. The meat is sliced super thin and it lean with little fat. The bread is a fresh rye bread. Got one to go."}
{"text":"World famous Clevelands own Slyman. Great corn beef potato cakes and ginger ale. Be ready to eat and eat a lot my friend. Huge portions await you with cheap prices. The food is made to order and come out fast. The service is polite and friendly. Ps you won't be able to finish the food"}
{"text":"Pros:
- The food was terrific. My family and I went for breakfast and we, of course, tried the corned beef - fabulous! The portions were very generous as well.
- Service was very friendly and quick. The cooks and people at the counter were also happy to say hello and goodbye.
- The seating area was quite clean. It's not going to be a super-cozy dining experience, but it is good for what it is - a diner.

Cons: - For a diner meal, it's not the cheapest. I got two eggs, home fries, toast and corned beef for $12.50. Maybe I'm super-cheap, but I felt that it could have been at a slightly lower price point.

Overall: A very good diner experience - don't leave without trying their corned beef."}
{"text":"Our friend from Cleveland touted Slyman's Deli as the BEST deli in Cleveland.After eating here my friends and I agree.The Pastrami sandwich can easily feed two people and is delicious.I had soup and a salami sandwich and enjoyed it very much.I recommend this place !!!"}
{"text":"Whoa!  This sandwich is enormous!  Plan on sharing or having leftovers for days!  Delicious and definitely not disappointing!"}
{"text":"Holy Heaven.

I loved this corned beef.  It's thin as paper and densely piled with love.  

But that reuben, that was damn good.  It was actually more of a huge mass of corned beef with a small amount of sauerkraut and swiss, but nonetheless great.  

I took the leftovers of my sandwich and fed the 3 homeless kids outside.  Well, I didn't, but I'm sure I could have.  And they would have been full for days.  

Oh, and the service?  Outstanding.  No screaming or yelling or dirty looks between the employees; and we arrived (wisely) smack dab at 12:30.  Things seems to work in such an orderly fashion despite the initial appearance of chaos.  We chose to sit and eat our food, which arrived at the same time (if not faster) than those waiting for takeout.  
They must have been doing this for a while...

Leftovers are calling."}
{"text":"If you want a sandwich, they'll give you a sandwich. 12 oz of corned beef and 2 slices of bread. This sandwich was enormous and flavorful. Had it with a little mustard and thousand island dressing. Was a bit salty, but it should be expected. Only complaint was I wish it was open a bit later. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"The BEST Ever Corn Beef I have ever tasted, being going there for over 20 years.  Love it"}
{"text":"My sister and brother-in-law took me here on a typical weekday.  The weather outside was terrible but inside it smelled like how a good deli should, something this west coast girl isn't too familiar with.  I had the corned beef - it was so amazing."}
{"text":"Dude I actually have nothing to say about this restaurant yeah just need to go just go looks like a hole In the way and looks like you might get killed when you go there but you won't because there's probably 50 guns under the counters in the place and probably 15 off-duty officers and probably 1-3 local Cleveland celebrities the corn beef sandwich is approximately a mile high the Jewish rye bread is amazing ...ORDER THE STEVE HARVY"}
{"text":"I was visiting a friend in Cleveland so we had to go to all the touristy and famous restaurants. However we didn't have much time, so we just picked up a corned beef sandwich to go. We were a tad put off by the price - $15 - but it was on the Food Network, so whatever. We also weren't hungry, so we decided to save it for later.

3 hours later....we tried the sandwich and it was deeeeeelicious! I'm not a huge fan of corned beef or sandwiches in general, but somehow the texture of the beef is super thin and kind of indescribable. They give an inordinate amount of meat on the sandwich, and the 3 of us could barely finish the sandwich. It's really simple - just corned beef, mustard, and cheese on rye - but it really is super yum.

Warning : wear a bib. I had tiny bits of corned beef all over my shirt."}
{"text":"I thought that I would give this place a try, considering the high rating on Yelp. This place was pretty busy during lunchtime, but most people were taking out their food and the lineup was pretty long for that, even though the actual sit-down area was fairly empty. I was surprised that the famous sandwiches cost $14. I've been to many delis and the sandwiches are not usually that expensive. All in all, the pastrami sandwich was too salty for my liking and I didn't like how the meat was pan fried before being put into the sandwich. That being said, the corned beef sandwich was better than the pastrami one."}
{"text":"I asked local's where to go for lunch and was directed to Slyman's. The reuben was delicious and so huge I could only eat half!"}
{"text":"This is THE place for Corned Beef in Cleveland. The sandwiches are expensive, but they are enough for two people-- they even give you extra bread! The place is nothing fancy, the lines are always long (hours on St. Paddy's Day!) but the service is quick and pleasant, and the food is great. We regularly pick up Slyman's for relatives that no longer live in town."}
{"text":"I was hoping to try this place last year when I was in Cleveland but didn't get the chance. This year, I got to Cleveland Thursday afternoon for the warriors game 6 matchup and missed the lunch hour again. 

Had we won, I probably would have had to peel myself off the ground to get to the airport Friday afternoon and would have had to wait until next year to try it. That is if the OKC Thunder don't have anything to say about that.

Their corned beef was comparable to some of the better corned beef I've had in Boston, NYC, and Philly. Horseradish and Russian dressing could have been more viscous but the corned beef was phenomenal. Definitely the best piece of food I've had in Cleveland.

The service was great as well from the head chef, down to my waitress and POS attendant. I was fully decked out in my warriors gear, yet they were very hospitable. I will most definitely be back. Cannot think of a comparable product on the west coast or in the southeast. I'll be back for game 6 warriors win next year ;)"}
{"text":"We arrived at exactly 2:29pm, and instead of turning us away, they not only made us sandwiches but gave us some corned beef to try since we'd never tried it before. The people were incredibly kind, and this sandwich is amazing! We got the Reuben split into 2 sandwiches and it's perfect for 2 people. I definitely recommend stopping by here- just get there earlier than we did."}
{"text":"Best corned beef sandwich I ever had. There is no reason to go here other than that."}
{"text":"Corned Beef on Rye.  Order it.  Really the best corned beef I've had in forever.  If your eye wanders off to other things on the menu...focus!...ORDER THE CORNED BEEF SANDWICH!  The beef is cut against the grain so the meat is tender and nearly melts in your mouth.  It's wonderfully seasoned and the rye is a perfect compliment.  Order extra bread because they give you so much meat that you can make 2 sandwiches out of one.  Their fries are pretty good also.

For the hardcore foodies, I would not be afraid to put this sandwich up against a Katz's or 2nd Ave Deli's corned beef sandwich.  If the stars align, this one might just be the best one!  [Calm down NYers, I said IF the stars align.]

The restaurant itself is homey with good service.  And you get to watch the massive line of people ordering corned beef and the chefs carving up mounds of meat.  Just a great local restaurant!  Wish I worked nearby...perfect place for lunch."}
{"text":"At first glance, this place looks like any other typical Cleveland eatery. The décor is lacking, the beverages are straight from the can, and random memorabilia is prominently displayed throughout the establishment. This is all part of the experience--the illusion of a long-forgotten diner, the out-dated tables and chairs. This is simply to keep away the unworthy. 
Look closer, and notice the Steve Harvey Awards on the shelves. 
Corned Beef bigger than a baby calf. 
Welcome to your new favorite sandwich joint."}
{"text":"What can I say except \"God bless the Midwest\" if stopping by bring your best appetite, the meals are not only good they're huge portions. This is a very busy place but we got really great service and the meal was worth the wait."}
{"text":"As good as any corned beef I'd had anywhere, I love this place, These guys know how to do it. The sandwiches are huge the priced right for the amount of food you receive. I've been coming here for years and will keep coming here anytime i'm in the area. Love Freddy great guy . Keep up the good work !"}
{"text":"One sandwich will easily feed two.  The corned beef is the best.  Perfectly seasoned and lean.  Don't forget the pickle!"}
{"text":"Very good sandwiches for the location. You're not going to find better delicatessen in the area.  Their pastrami and corned beef was sliced very thin versus some delis that use thicker cuts. I think that takes away from the flavor a tiny bit, but it's still good. Also the bread is butter-toasted so it can be very greasy. Again, not necessarily a bad thing for all, but may dismay some."}
{"text":"Damn. In a good way. 

If you're hungry and have a thing for great corned beef, get on over to Slyman's and get ready to get filled up full. 

Not only is the food money, the atmosphere is very pleasant, a strong family feel immediately evident. Next time I'm in Cleveland, I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I love corned beef but this place takes it to the next level and then some, simply out of this world. If you're looking for a unique place to grab food in Cleveland and can deal with their odd hours and long lines you need to stop here. The lines can look intimidating (out the door and down the street a bit at times) but it moves relatively quick. The guys behind the counter work at an insanely fast speed, no loafing at this place. They have a dining room but it's pretty small and very cramped but any kind of waiting and claustrophobia are more than made up for with the best deli corned beef you will ever have. If you're visiting Cleveland just go here, trust me."}
{"text":"Awesome!!! Corned Beef Sandwich 
Rode a bike from downtown Cleveland 
Totally worth it Thanks"}
{"text":"Very very good. Daughter loved the vegetarian burger. Staff was awesome, food amazing."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Slymans yet go there NOW!  The best corned beef in the world! Hell I didn't like corned beef before I went here, now the cravings wont stop."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  The corned beef is the best you can get.....literally.  It's one of those places that probably hasn't changed their process since they opened and it's worked out perfectly for everyone.  

The service is equal to the food.  They try to get everyone moved in and out but I've NEVER felt rushed.  The waitresses (I don't think there are any waiters) are the sweetest around.  They're super quick and super sweet and aren't condescending to newbies.  There's so much beef that this place puts on their sandwiches that most can't finish it all and the waitresses are always quick to bring extra bread and a bag to make your left overs at home with all the original ingredients. 

It's not a large place so expect a line out the door if you're a few minutes late to lunch."}
{"text":"One of the best places I've ever gone for breakfast. Unassuming and positively delightful. Old school breakfast of two eggs over easy with hash browns.
Couldn't have been better. I would never go anywhere else in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Had the corned beef, and some pierogi.  I have to say the corned beef is something special.  They sort of fine-chop the meat, which is the first time I'd seen that.  But it lets you manage the sandwich better, if that make sense.  The pierogi was golden fried with onions, and you can't say no to that.

The location is a little strange.  It's the only \"deli\" I've seen that's built like a sports bar.  Not my scene.  But the food is great."}
{"text":"Sorry had to correct my spelling from the first time.
So I'd love to be able to tell you that I've tried a bunch of different things on the menu and that everything has been excellent and that is why I'm giving Slyman's 5 stars.  But sadly, I can't,  I'm giving it a 5 because every time I go I get the biggest best damn corned beef sandwhich I've ever had and I'd hate to miss out on it by trying something different.  I'm sure that all of their monstrous sandwiches are excellent but to date I haven't been able to try anything else.  Its a huge sandwich easily enough for two people in share, I may attempt to order a pastrami next time or maybe i'll bite the bullet and order two sandwiches and then I can still have my love along with trying something new."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong.  You should go... especially if you're a huge fan of pastrami.  The meat is stacked high, and the sandwich hits the spot.  It's no Katz Deli, but it's probably the closest thing to it without hopping a flight to NYC.  I had the pastrami and my companion had the reuben.  The coffee is standard diner quality, but you didn't come here for gourmet coffee.  I can't recall what other beverage options they even had... I think soda.  

No frills interior, but you didn't go there for the decor either.  I hear that sometimes there's a line to get in.. .I wouldn't wait in line for it.  We went towards the end of their day.. it was sometime early afternoon on a weekend.  There was no line, there was no crowd, we sat and were served right away.

If you're dying for a good pastrami/reuben and you're in Cleveland, I would recommend this place.  If I loved this kind of food more, I would have considered bumping it to 4*.  It's really a 3.5 *... but just can't give it the bump to the 4, because it's unlikely I'll go back.  Just made me wish I were back in NYC and made me miss Katz.

-----------------------------------
Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist.  I guess I'll come along if someone wants to go. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going. If they insist, I may come and not eat, or may just see them some other time."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday at lunchtime.  Was pleased to be sat immediately, even with a high chair need.  Ordered a pastrami Ruben.   AMAZING!  Wife had the classic corned beef, she was wowed too.  I am kicking myself after living in NE Ohio for a year now, I just found this place.

Only weird thing, cannot tip on credit cards... So bring cash for gratuity."}
{"text":"At Slyman's, you have the singular opportunity to pay the price of two sandwiches ($14) to get one sandwich with five sandwiches' worth of meat. Thankfully, the meat is really friggin' delicious.

Slyman's is all about the meat. It comes piled between two slices of rye bread, but there's nothing special about that bread. The potato salad we ordered was okay but I can't remember why it was okay, so I guess it wasn't very memorable. The fries were of the bagged, crinkle cut variety and they tasted like the fryer oil hadn't been changed in a really long time. 

Personally, I'd rather pay single-sandwich price for a single sandwich with a reasonable bread to meat ratio. But since that's not an option here, my man and I split a Reuben and had plenty of meat left on our plate when we were done. 

Why three stars? The corned beef is just that saltily, disgustingly, artery-clogging good."}
{"text":"Corned beef & Pastrami

Probably the closest thing you will get to old style NY deli (a la Katz's) west of NY.

Great place that serves up pastrami and corned beef in heaping sized sandwiches.  The place packs out and when they run out, they run out so tough luck.

They do have other meat and sandwiches but this is what you come for: corned beef with brown mustard and french fries.  The best.

I have only been here for lunch and I believe it closes at 2, so you need to get in there early and get your fix.

The interior is kind of cramped and the service is very good.  Hard working waitresses get your on your way with your order and a wise crack or two.

All in all a great meal if you are in this area."}
{"text":"I took a co worker there for his first time.......He loved it!!

This is by far the best corned beef in town."}
{"text":"Slyman's corned beef Reuben with sauerkraut on the side was fantastic!! Absolutely! 
A bit awkward to eat because they put so much meat between normal sized rye bread. I had to take half the meat out and carry it home. It made a second huge sandwich the next day. The pickle was delicious yet the kraut was the star. We also ordered fries to share and I had a pop. My daughter had the same sandwich and tea. $32.00 before the tip!!! 

My daughter and I went for lunch on a week day. It was full and there was no line. All men and noisy! A little uncomfortable. Fortunately there were waitresses.  The atmosphere was too tight and old for me to ever eat inside again. The waitress stood less than 3 feet away from us and had her part in our conversation. She literally had no where else to stand. This family really needs to put some money into this business. I mean ...if there are lines down the street an all (like other reviewers state).. Had there been a line I'm sure it would have been a fire hazard. Just too tight....too cramped. I give FIVE STARS on the FOOD but the price and grunge atmosphere lessen the dining experience for me. If I ever find myself hungry and on that side of town again I will go to Slyman's and take out."}
{"text":"Best corned beef, hands down. You can't find better corned beef anywhere. The portions are big, the prices are low and the staff is very friendly. Send the office intern early however because the wait is always out the door but well worth it. Presidents have visited this spot. If you're looking for a place with a neighborhood feel, quality food and a lot of it you have to eat here!"}
{"text":"Absolutely unbelievable! As usual you better bring an appetite. I think it's a half pound of meat. It's very good. Whenever I'm in town Slyman's is one of the first stops. They have other things on the menu but to be honest I haven't tried anything other than the corned beef."}
{"text":"Biggest corned beef in Cleveland?  Perhaps.  Best?  Unfortunately not.  My sandwich was lukewarm upon serving, with a large pickle side and a wide accoutrement of dressings and sides.  While certainly the sandwich didn't taste bad, there were no striking characteristic flavors, no exclamations of excitement, no fluorescent light-bulb exploding in my head.  The cheese was mild and flat, not pungent or aromatic in the slightest.  The beef itself, while certainly tender, lacked the fatty and flavorful full mouth experience that are a necessity in these types of sandwiches.  Horseradish and associated dressing were mediocre at best.

The service I received was excellent, with that being said the dinner is small and rather crowded.  Considering that the price of a corned beef Reuben is $14, and given the average quality of food, I was quite surprised at Slyman's popularity.  I can vouch as well as any other red blooded american male that more meat is better, but in this case quantity does not make the sandwich, as the meat suffers from a quality issue."}
{"text":"Mercy, Mercy, Mercy~ thank goodness they are only open for breakfast and lunch and not located conveniently to my house or I would have a serious issue sticking to my mostly healthy eating goals!
So tasty are the sandwiches!  LEAN corned beef piled high on fresh rye bread.  Was able to make 3 sandwiches out of 1 to go order.  Added on a baggie of bread ends for $.50 and a couple of extra pieces of Swiss cheese and I was good to go.  The nice crunchy garlicky dill pickle topped off lunch for me.  
No wonder so many celebrities have visited there!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! The corned beef is sooo good and the portions are very generous."}
{"text":"Man - that is freaking good corned beef! 

This is better than anything in Brooklyn (sadly)."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are enormous. But they're good, stuffed high with meat (and cheese). This is a workingman's place for lunch. Get here early. And check the website for their days and hours of operation."}
