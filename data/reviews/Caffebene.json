{"text":"This place is apparently a hugely famous Korean coffee chain that's all over Southeast Asia and was brought here to cater to the foreign Asian student population. I got the Thai milk bubble tea and it was certainly... milky. There was a Thai iced tea flavor/color to it, I'll give them that, dunno how well it mixes with tapioca pearls, and for the price I'll go across the street to Basil Thai. Everything in here was hilariously expensive. I got a blueberry muffin that could have been purchased at Sam's Club by the pallet for the same level of quality. The place is clean, the uniforms are cute, and I'm sure the homesick ex-pats will keep it in business, but for those prices vs. quality I'll be going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Yesterday we ordered 4 espresso drinks (two double and two macchiatos) and the coffee was so horrible that none of us was able to drink it!! We should have been warned when we asked what a \"cortado\" was and they told us it was an espresso with foam (I knew it was an espresso with a drop of milk but just wanted to confirm)

I would like to go back because the place looks really good, but if the quality of the coffee doesn't improve, I'll continue going to espresso royale and Starbucks!

I just wish I could get my $15 back!!"}
{"text":"Sam the manager makes a special effort every time we come in! I recommend the green tea latte, and the star berry honey bread. The sandwiches are perfectly toasted and the meat to bread ratio is ideal."}
{"text":"This has been my third trip to caffe bene over the past year.  Their coffee is on the stronger side and is priced competitively with starbucks.  If you go in the morning and order an ice coffee they will give you a hot coffee and a cup of ice.  Today I ordered a mojito mint coffee.  It consists of mojito mix, mint leaves, cream, and espresso.  It has a smooth finish and it didn't take long for them to make."}
{"text":"The menu is unique, the staff is very friendly and professional. I particularly like their green tea. Unlike Espresso Royale, their internet works fine.
However, their menu is definitely overpriced, which is why I am giving them 3 stars."}
{"text":"Overpriced for what they offer.  $7 for a double scoops of glorified ice cream.  It's not gelato.  I've been to Europe and know what gelato is."}
{"text":"I love the blended ice!!!!!!!!Size is great for three people and the fruit is fresh. Will come again."}
{"text":"Tea is better than coffee. Sandwich is okay.
Environment is great. Things look better than taste. A bit pricy. 

A good place to study or spend time with friends here."}
{"text":"Delicious food and drinks with excellent presentation. Very cool atmosphere. And Sam (the manager) is great!"}
{"text":"Really not worth it! I wouldn't visit again even if the menu wasn't 2-3 times as expensive as it should be. I had several bad experiences here and wont' return. For example: I ordered a bubble tea smoothie, they charged me $5+, and when they gave me the drink they told me they were out of bubbles. So I just paid $5 for some iced tea. They are always out of misugaru, which is the only unique thing about them. The gelato is hilariously expensive, you can go to the farmers market and get a pint of fresh gelato for almost the same price. The coffee tastes watered down. The atmosphere is cute, but that doesn't make up for poor service and bad food & drinks. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Ambience.  9/10.  Looks nice, feels clean, comfortable.
Customer Service.  8/10.  Assistant manager was great, knowledgeable, helpful.
Taste.  2/10.  Misugaru latte tasted like drinking dissolved chalk in water.  Classic Arnold palmer was a very badly conceived balance of tea to lemonade.  Honey bread was 99% standard dry bread.  Though it tasted okay, the dryness from the rest of the bread overtook any toppings added to it.
Value.  1/10.  Honey bread is probably something close to a 2000% markup on ingredients.  Cannot go here regularly without breaking the bank.  If the taste and quality and consistency of the drinks was commensurate with the price, then that'd be different since the upcharge would be tied to a higher level of enjoyment from a higher quality product.  But it seems like they are peddling cheap and badly made drinks and food, for outrageous prices.

Going once a year is probably a good bet for this place.  Going too often will make you poor, and will leave a bad taste in your mouth (if the food and drink hasn't already), because you feel as though you've paid for a meal and a drink, but have been given a hodgepodge of 10 cent ingredients prettied up to look good.  

Great ambience, and customer service only get you so far when the food and drink you serve is inconsistent, outrageously priced, and lackluster at best."}
{"text":"Terrible. Got a Thai tea smoothie for close to six bucks and it was the worst thai tea flavored thing I've ever tasted, just straight up tasted like milk. Friend got a milk tea latte and it was half powder not mixed properly. They don't even try, it seems. Another friend got gelato which tasted like frozen sugar water and nothing like pomegranate. also ridiculous expensive for small portion. I have yet to hear anything good on their menu, but especially stay away from thai tea, milk tea, red velvet, any gelato."}
{"text":"Food is average, if not below in quality. Prices are overprices as well. The service is okay. Friendly but not speedy.

Cheesecake is delicious, but not worth $5 a slice."}
{"text":"They have the best bubble tea. The short polish supervisor so nice. The tall white guy cashier is nice too. An american japanese mix staff is nice as well. But seriously, they have the best bubble tea in town and much better than cocomero. VERY OK. I wish they can lower the price"}
{"text":"This place is terrible! Today I ordered a bubble milk tea and they only gave me ONE bubble!! On top of that the cup was only half full!!

The little bit I got was mediocre at best as well. I'm not sure why this place is so popular and honestly I think campustown is better off without these cheats.

Caffe Paradiso and Espresso Royale aroUnd the corner are much, much better."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was great, had 3 different drinks and they were all good! (Misutgaru Frappe, Mango Mojito, Green tea Frappe) My only complaint is that the cafe is too quiet so people had to whisper. Hope they provide some music so we can talk more freely."}
{"text":"I know they're super busy in the afternoon but everyone was asking if their drink was done or not and they totally forgot about my drink for 20 minutes and didn't even apologize for forgetting about it. Usually most companies would upgrade the size as an apology but they just gave me the normal size. it's super crowded too and for the first time I've come, I realized that i'm not coming from now on."}
{"text":"Caffe Bene is a place I really want to like, but I can't.
The menu is shockingly expensive, it seems like most drinks start at above four dollars. For the price they are charging you'd expect amazing drinks, but unfortunately that is not the case. I've tried the pearl milk tea, which IIRC cost closer to 5 dollars, and it was unfortunately too sweet and the pearl was still hard in the center. I suspect it was not made from brewed tea but instead made from some kind of powder mix. I've also had the cafe mocha which was good, but it wasnt worth the price. 

Even though I think Caffe Bene is a poor value, I still enjoy my visits there. The decor is a nice switch from the other local coffeeshops, with a nice modern twist on the coffeeshop concept. This place is also brightly lit unlike some other places nearby. Additionally, the wifi is great and there are quite a few power plugs avalilable. This is a place I think I'll return to when I need to study or get things done."}
{"text":"I really really do not like this place. They charge close to $10 for honey bread.It's literally a piece of bread with honey, whipped cream, and fruit on top. Rip off. Also their bubble tea is gross, clearly from a powder, and tastes super artificial... Just don't come here!!! This is one of the only businesses in town that I sincerely hope closes. I know they are a huge chain in Korea and with such a big Korean population during the school year I assume it will thrive, so I guess it's here to stay (and suck."}
{"text":"So good, I tried their waffle with cookies and cream gelato and it was to DIE FOR. A little on the pricey side, it gives students a great atmosphere to study in (in my mind). I will be coming back for more! Also a bonus that they offer deals with Hooked app now."}
{"text":"The trainee at the counter was really nice and polite. The lady that was supervising her was very rude. When I ordered a drink called misugaru, the trainee was trying to figure out how to order. The supervisor came over rudely and asked me \"what are you trying to order\" in a really off putting way. The trainee was EXTREMELY polite by the way! When the drink came out it was not what I was expecting, and really gross. We spent $18 at the place, so I went to the counter immediately and explained it wasn't what I was expecting and if possible I'd like to change my order. The trainee apologized and went to ask her supervisor. The supervisor, right in front of me, wouldn't turn around. She told the trainee \"ummm no I don't think we do that\". The trainee apologized. Bad experience. I didn't expect a free drink, even though we spent a lot of money. I at least wanted the supervisor to look at me and explain instead of Laying it on the very nice trainee.

I ended up drinking most of the misugaru. I like healthy carb options, and it's not all the bad. The initial taste was weird but it's okay. It's a multi-grain mill drink. The only thing is that when I spend a lot of money at a place, and unfortunately order something I don't enjoy, I hope the supervisor comes out to ask what's wrong..."}
{"text":"Caffe Bene has a lot of drinks that I would love to try but it is so overpriced. The inside of the place is amazing. They have a clean and cool atmosphere. This is a great place to meet international students. If you want coffee go somewhere else. I did try their mango smoothie and loved it."}
{"text":"DON'T GO! The spinach shrimp sandwich made me super sick. Ended up ruining my birthday because I needed to be near a bathroom. Save your money and your toilet."}
{"text":"Overpriced. The wait is forever. Don't order anything when you are in a hurry.

Bubble milk tea is not as good as CocoMero. The only good thing is that they make it after you order it so you can adjust it by \"less sugar\", \"less ice\", etc. as opposed to the pre-made milk tea at CocoMero which you can't ask for less sugar. Besides that, CocoMero serves better milk tea (better taste with a similar price).

Pistachio macaroons are okay (don't compare them to Ladurée). Other flavors are \"meh\". 

Staff is nice today."}
{"text":"My favorite stop for coffee here!  I just love their cappuccino cakes. Every time I go there I ask for their cappuccino cakes I don't know if they buy it or make it there but it just tastes so good. The environment is so pleasant and I enjoy being served in their cup and saucer."}
{"text":"Although they've only been around for almost half a year, I think Caffebene is getting a lot better! First things first, they did lower their prices (which actually scared me off initially) and they're around the same/less than Starbucks. They're opening a new location on Green Street, so I hope they handle the first weeks better.

The interior is really trendy and usually quiet, so it's a nice place to grab a cup of coffee and study. Their green tea frappe is alright. I think it's a bit too icy and Starbucks makes it better. However, the honey bread is fantastic! I got the strawberry honey bread to go and it's absolutely gorgeous how they package their food. The bread is really sweet and thick, drizzled in honey, and on top is an arrangement of strawberries in the form of a flower. I was wondering why it took so long for it to come out, but it's definitely worth the wait! Their gelato is also fantastic and they give you a lot for $2. I recommend getting the green tea or Greek yogurt flavors.

They also have meal options and tons of the cutest desserts, so I definitely plan to return and try them!"}
{"text":"As an update to my last review, where I made a vow to myself to get the honey bread, I finally did it and have no ragrets - not even a single letter. The strawberry honey bread is so so so amazing, so do yourself a favor and GET IT 'cause it just bumped my review from 4 to 5 stars."}
{"text":"Though expensive, the waffles here are amazing! The sandwiches are delicious, too (I've tried both portobello and spicy chicken). The atmosphere is perfect for studying -- they always have chill music on and there's little noise."}
{"text":"Almost every time I order something, they make mistakes. For example, they forgot to make my coffee, they served you different kind of muffin, and they don't even apologize. Everything is very expensive. Bubbles are half cooked and not chewy at all. People working in this places are not well trained and seem rude to me."}
{"text":"The shrimp sandwich looked good but tasted bad. The shrimp inside aren't fresh. Taro milk tea was ok. Good environment to study though."}
{"text":"Not sure I get the non-love for this place. Then again, maybe I've been around this town too long--when there WERE no Caffe Benes in town. Now we got two. I usually only order a cheap drink (under $2) so I don't quite follow the over-priced comments. Yes, they're overpriced, but that's what you get with a boutique coffee shop imported from South Korea. (Ironically, this place isn't that popular in \"the motherland\" and is notorious for its \"bad-tasting coffee.\" Yet it's taking over the world OUTSIDE S. Korea. Go figure). As far as study spaces go, unless you want super quiet (go to the library or stay home), it's not too bad. There are hours that are quiet and hours that are super busy. Pick the time that works for you. But as far as a space that's conveniently located, clean, and has multiple outlets and decent wi-fi, this place can't be beat."}
{"text":"What's the WiFi password?? Love this place because it is right next to the social Work building, where I have most of my classes. But I NEED THE WIFI"}
{"text":"Employee refused to give me water. Food is average for the high price point. The study environment is decent."}
{"text":"Service and ambiance are both alright, but the food is lacking... The gelato is good but it really shouldn't be called gelato."}
{"text":"Little pricy for the coffee and other beverages but it's a great place to hang out with friends and catch up. Also free wifi!"}
{"text":"I had their red bean ice parfait & their strawberry honey bread! The red bean ice is sweet red beans over crushed ice, gelato, mochi, & almonds. The honey bread is this special bread that's lightly toasted so that it's slightly crispy on the outside & chewy soft on the inside. It's topped with sweetened strawberries & cheese. So good! While beautifully presented, the menu item are pricey. I spent $15 for the red bean ice & the honey bread. But the ambiance is lovely & inviting. It's a nice place to take a date or to treat yourself."}
{"text":"I have no idea why this place is $$ when it really is $. Much better than Starbucks imo (i don't really care about the inspector situation because as long as they use boiling water to make their coffee I'm assuming they don't dip their hands in it afterwards). This place overshadows Starbucks as a casual hangout/study in a couple areas:
1. Much better lighting and study areas (more tables) - I'm sorry Starbucks but I absolutely hate your dimly lit areas for studying (for romantic coffee, may be better), the natural light really comes in and the store is right on the corner facing the south with huge windows so you get really good natural lighting all day long. On the downside, it's less cozy (but much better for studying!)
2. Wider selection of nondrink items. They give you two heaping scoops of gelato for $2.95 - so yummy and definitely more yogurty (less sweet deadening) than other gelato ive had. They also have really soft and fresh asian pastries, tons of sweet and salty options, and even little cups of korean bibimbaps! They also serve warm breakfast and tons of little snacks (all MUCH cheaper than Starbucks and even more delicious!)
3. Cute decor. This place is korean, so this place has got a super kawaii atmosphere about it. The music is soft and cafe-like, they have lots of little plants and books in the place - definitely gives me the feeling that I'm back in asia again (aside from almost everyone in the whole store being asian)
Definitely reminds me of White Windmill back home, but with a less crowded, more brightly lit study environment."}
{"text":"Trendy interior, quiet atmosphere, decent enough customer service; if you want to work for long hours with a consistent supply of snacks and coffee, I would like to recommend this one. However, this caffe lacks originality unlike the nearby ones (Caffe Pardiso/ Espresso Royale). I definitely do not expect ready-made pack of sushi in front of the cash counter of a caffe. Also, I saw a wide variation of breads and other baked products which did not seem appealing for my taste bud. I have had cappuccino and chai latte over here. Cappuccino was good but the chai latte was lukewarm and lacked spices."}
{"text":"It's alright. A place to go when Caffe Paradiso is closed for me. Service, not bad. Coffee, can be improved. Place, internet is absolutely horrible."}
{"text":"I have to say that I went into Cafe Bene due to my remembrance of them from Korea, and despite the majority of their reviews here on Yelp. I don't particularly love the coffee, as it's not really coffee, like Starbucks, but I like the atmosphere, staff and the Korean nostalgia I get when I am inside. The prices are steep but mainly on stuff that is not the coffee, such as the bingsoo or waffles. I would say that Cafe Bene beats out the, close, neighboring competition by a long shot; Caffe Paradiso and Espresso Royale are really no good in the coffee department."}
{"text":"Looking for good boba? Not here for flavor.  The boba pearls have the right chewiness, not too chewy that they stick to your teeth and not over-cooked, but the Thai tea flavor is less than desirable, too sweet and artificial, kind of like a vanilla nutritional shake"}
{"text":"The bubble tea is really good.  Comfy chairs and very nice decor.   Lots of windows. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"I think this place is so new that they still need time to work out their menu and service.
Staffs were friendly but service was really slow and there were barely any customers when I went.
Had coffee latte which was very very light barely any coffee taste...hmm not that good, my cousin tried the mojito and she liked it.
We also ordered the honey toast with strawberry and cream cheese, the presentation was very pretty but 
I wish they would toast it a bit longer to give it a little extra crunch
Overall a good spot to chill if they can improve their drinks and food"}
{"text":"Update--service is a bit better than before (compared to a year ago) however, the wait time is still on the longer side. As for taste, it is still on the lower quality. Their milk teas and bubble teas are still powder based which doesn't surprise me as it is part of a chain. However it blows my mind that something as simple as milk tea requires powder packets for the sake of convenience. As for their coffees, I'd love to see the beans treated with the respect they deserve. There's much more than just sticking a label on it \"from Ethiopia\" or \"Fair Trade\". Overall, it's not somewhere I would choose to go to."}
{"text":"Over priced but solid coffee and desserts.  It makes this place a \"once in a while\" \"treat yo'self\" kind of a place rather than a regular study spot.  But, with that said, I love the decor, love the space, think it's great for studying to hanging out, and even think the uniforms are kind of cute in a fun way.  On a student budget though it's definitely not somewhere I would go often especially when there are more reasonably priced places really close by."}
{"text":"Really cool decor and quick service. There were plenty of places to sit and the coffee was good."}
{"text":"Okay so I've tried all of their teas now. Ginger twist is by far the best. Mind you, I don't contaminate tea with sugar or honey or anything like that, so it's at its purest. There are some other great options also, but ginger twist is my favorite. The only downside is that it isn't caffeinated so you might want to opt for a different type if you need that boost. Don't be shy to try their coffee, it's got an interesting little kick to it, which I really enjoy, but may not necessarily be up your alley. In terms of ambience, I LOVE studying here. It's calm and mostly quiet. Most people are running to the nearby Starbucks for their caffeine fix, which makes for lots of seating and a great atmosphere for studying. Great Starbucks alternative. Oh! Also, their food choices are WAY cheaper than Starbucks and comparatively delicious"}
{"text":"The coffee is quite good. It's always my go to place in champaign. I love the space, it's comfy and so good for working. Definitely cheaper than other coffee places in champaign. Usually order frappe coffee and never tried anything else though.
The place is getting better after a year opening."}
{"text":"I tried some latte drink, honey bread, and waffles. The drinks take forever to be ready. They have a weird serving system going on. When it was crowded, there was confusions about who orders what. The ambience is good for studying and just chilling. They were picky about the wiFi and I think they changed the password pretty often. The honey bread is ok and the waffles is really soft and yummy. However, I think this place is so overpriced to be on a campus area."}
{"text":"5 stars for the pastries, but 3 for the espresso. I love Americanos so I know when my coffee isn't made right. I think they need to up the shots of espresso, because my drink tasted like water. The Strawberry Cheese bread we ate was tasty though!!! I also LOVE the misugaru latte! Will be back for those but probably not the coffee."}
{"text":"Nice environment and wonderful milk tea. 
Love the hot bubble tea latte so much. 
Best milk tea in campus!
The mojito is nice as well. All of the mojito look so cute!
Coffee towel is too big for me lol."}
{"text":"a Korean cafe whose only tea is \"Mighty Leaf\" tea bags?  the only green tea is a sweet fake flavor \"tropical green tea.\" Not even kidding.  what in the world?  there must be some mistake."}
{"text":"Terrible. My friend and I both found small black hairs in our sandwiches. I have long brown hair and she has long blonde hair. Ewwww. Never going back."}
{"text":"Love the brand and their product. But this local one is just not satisfactory. Ordered a hot bubble but it was at most warm. This is not the first time this happens. I like Caffe Bene so I try to visit often and like this one. But after many time's trying I am just disappointed with such high price and low service."}
{"text":"Restaurant review
This is a brief review of their coffee. I did come here one other time for dessert which was amazing however I recently got their bubble tea to go. Service is quick after they take your order. There is multiple drink options including bubble tea with Boba. I can't say that I'm a fan of this over Starbucks coffee. The other thing that makes me nervous is that the flavoring is likely a powder however I ended up with the traditional milk tea. It is rather sweet even sweeter than a latte. If milk tea is your thing then it's great to have this place is an option

Pros: This café has both desserts, coffee, and other Asian type desserts

Cons: Slightly expensive compared to Starbucks

{"text":"Very spacious coffee shop in Urbana. I wish this was around for most of my undergrad - alas it didn't really pop up until I was almost done with grad school. The interior furniture is fun and a lot of the dessert items are very fun too. Giant sweetbreads loaded with fruit and giant BingSu! The shop has Korean roots so they serve Korean sushi as well as spicy tuna onigiri I think. 

The coffee is alright. My most recent visit was before students moved back to campus so the ambience was inviting and relaxing. I think during the year there is probably nowhere to sit in here which would probably annoy me if I wanted to stop in and just get a chill cup of coffee. 

There are signs on the doors that say no outside food or drink. I feel like this should be obvious but clearly there have been mult. Patrons guilty of this faux paux!"}
{"text":"Overpriced
Low Value
Long wait times
Poor quality.

If these things describe your coffee go here."}
