{"text":"I used to LOVE this place until today. They have new staff and my order is ALWAYS wrong now. Tell me what Mexican Restaurant serves Carne Asada fries with no sour cream, barely any cheese and no guac? When I called to ask about why my order wasn't correct, the cashier was rude and basically offered no help or solution and now because of that I will never go back there! Too bad, they actually have some really good carne asada fries, when it's done right!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service and quality you can count on. These folks truly know what they're doing. Clean authentic setting. Thanks my friend!  B"}
{"text":"El Amigo serves authentic Mexico City food.  I dropped by after work for a bite to eat, and I was pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant is located in a kind of scary strip mall, but the interior is roomy, clean, and well-decorated with ocean view window murals and potted plants.  I ordered chicken soup and another item at the counter.  It was brought to my table by a lady I understood to be the owner.  She was friendly, attentive, and solicitous.  I very much enjoyed all the food.  I intend to visit again if I ever am working in that neighborhood again."}
{"text":"I got a carne asada burrito, a ground beef taco and a tamale this afternoon. The taco was decent, the tamale was good but had beans in it which was unusual but still yummy. I was however disappointed with the burrito. I found 3 different hairs in it... But not being much of a germaphobe I just picked them out. The meat had a good flavor but I had to spit almost every piece out because most of it was just grizzle. The rice was so mushy that its texture was more like mashed potatoes, and the hot sauce was really watery....mostly water actually. I wont be back"}
{"text":"I came here a lot the past 15 or so years.  It was a great place to eat with amazing food.  They did get new owners and the food was still good.  But I went there last month and the place had a for lease sign in the window!  I can't believe we don't get Mexican food in our area anymore!  I am very sad!  I gave 5 stars for what it used to be."}
{"text":"Love this place very a delicious Mexican food. The meat is marinated and so flavorful. This is family owned and the people are so nice. If you want great homemade authentic Mexican food come here. The neighborhood is sketchy but other than that it's cool."}
{"text":"Would have never gone here but it was recommended to me and I was very impressed.  It is always quiet in the morning and the food is very authentic.  I have ordered early lunch there too and it was all great.  I had the chili relleno for breakfast and a taco, enchilada, and tamale for lunch...all was great.  The chips and salsa are good and the service is okay.  It is in a tiny strip mall next to Circle K at the NE corner of 19ave & Peoria.  Stop by sometime and grab a bite!"}
{"text":"Needed to find a spot to eat breakfast today and relied on trusty yelp! Found this little spot in a strip shopping area. It didn't look like much outside but boy was I surprised! I got the breakfast burrito with chorizo and my husband ordered the huevos rancheros. Big portions and very good eats! Def recommend!"}
