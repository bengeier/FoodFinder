{"text":"Amazing food and great friendly people. Kind of hard to find but it's totally worth going here. Get the T-Bolt or butter chicken samosas!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The food comes out hot and loaded with flavor. The staff was really friendly and help us first timers out. They have great portions. Can't wait to come back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Punjabi cheese burger was AMAZING!! The masala fries that came with the combo was okay, nothing special. Taste like Costco fries with pepper. Next time i will probably just order the burger ^^"}
{"text":"We ate here for dinner and it was delicious. Not too spicy but just the right amount. Nice decor and chill atmosphere. Hostess was very helpful. We here not disappointed and happy with our choice. We had the loaded fries, cheesecake samosas, jerk chicken samosas, Punjani and RGB d burgers it was all delicious!"}
{"text":"Awesome fusion cuisine. 
Awesome tandoori melt sandwich, butter chicken fries and moms biryanis. 
The best butter chicken in GTA area for sure. 

Keep it up guys."}
{"text":"Really good and unique flavours. When rick cooks you can tell.. The other times I've gone where he wasn't there, the food was a bit too salty. But it was still good. The service is consistently good as well.. Casual place."}
{"text":"I first experienced #RGE when they were operating Saturday's only in a pop up.  Was super impressed by the whole concept of fusing Rick's cultural influences with the other food he experienced as a kid growing up in Brampton.

From day 1 Rick and his team have been warm, receptive and friendly.....I always felt that the food was being cooked for me by the Indian little brother I never had. 

When they moved to their permanent location, I did not know what to expect.....but have been there several times now and it really is a cool spot really fitting with the whole concept.  Like the food, it is a modern take on a traditional thing.

Oh, yeah, the food has only gotten better...when I first tasted Rick's butter chicken mac and cheese and his incredible samosas I had no idea it would lead to an addiction to things like Punjabi Cheeseburgers and loaded fries.   All this romantic fusion of culture things only happens/works if the people in kitchen have a sense of what flavours work together.....it is as much art as science.....and here at RGE it is done right..all the time.

I have taken people there, I have taken food from there to functions and work pot lucks....I have yet to find anyone who was not as wowed by the food as I am.

It is a place that I will always go to...whether to sit in for a meal before a move around the corner or just to take out for a tasty night at home...it is always great to have a \"go to\" place where you know you will always be pleased by the people, the food, the ambiance and the value!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC FOOD!! 

As soon as I heard of this place I came running. I wanted to order everything off of the menu. Some really great items are the gourmet samosas and the t-bolt. The loaded butter chicken fries are to die for, I find myself returning almost every week. The staff are super warm and friendly and one of them gave me a free shortbread cookie. Love the laid back atmosphere. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"This food is great! Funky awesome twist on traditional Indian...it's comfort food fusion!  Legit portion sizes...fresh, yummy ingredients. Luckily, we bought a selection and shared around the table...Butter chicken mac and cheese was rich and creamy with the perfect amount of spice; t-bolt was crispy and delish (mmmm tandoori bacon!) try with the jalape√±os; loaded butter chicken fries-zesty sauce and Punjab burger...just mmm mmm good. Will definitely be ordering this again :) Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"Good Food. Will come back again! Had the punjab cheeseburger with tandoori bacon A+

Can comfirm !"}
{"text":"this place was a great find!... the food was delicious and had many unique menu items.  the staff were extremely friendly and helpful, especially Rick.  this restaurant is easy to get to and lots of free parking.  the portions were very generous and priced very reasonably.  

I would recommend this to anyone for some good home cooking and great spins on traditional dishes."}
{"text":"Im going to use an overused word right now but I feel that's the only world that would do justice to this place. AMAZING!  
I had the Punjabi Burger and butter chicken load fries.  The flavours were so distinct and the tasty.  I kept wanting to take another bite even when I was full.  
The burger was soft, flavourful and \"reminded me of my mom's burger\". 
The owners are nice and friendly and great you with a smile. 
This place is going to have long lineups soon so better get here fast!"}
{"text":"Had the butter chicken mac and cheese and several samosas and everything was amazing. Fresh and tasty Indian fusion which you won't find anywhere else. Rick has done a phenomenal job with the menu, the decor, and the customer experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Yummy!!!  The T-bolt was amazing.  And paired with the chaat fries, heavenly!  Will definitely be adding this place to my list of go-to favourites. Great ambience, great music, great service and most importantly, great food!"}
{"text":"If you're a *foodie* you came to the right place!!

Such a great fusion of delicious gourmet comfort foods and a Indian zest. 

Rick and Jahnay welcomed us as we came inside. 

Burger was made to order, fresh and only took about 10 mins. So good!!

Mac 'n cheese is amazing, a perfect dish that just feels good eating it. 


Telling my friends about this place! Welcome to the neighborhood!!

P.s. Rick created for Presidents Choice their Butter Chicken Lasagna! Check out the awards at the front door."}
{"text":"The food was very good. I went after reading other reviews and it was worth it. Obviously, the butter chicken macaroni was delicious. Other than that, the cheesecake samosa was fantastic. 

Definitely recommend it to people who like Indian food and want to try something new."}
{"text":"Loooove this place. I got a description of what to expect from someone, and I was not expecting this kind of food. So much better! The flavours and combos are excellent. We have tried just about everything, but loved their paneer blt with tandoori bacon and the fried tandoori chicken sandwich. Mmm mouth still watering. All of the samosas are phenomenal. They cater well too!!"}
{"text":"Food has so much flavour! The portions are huge so you get a great bang for your buck. I got the T-bolt sandwich and it's probably one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've had."}
{"text":"I took my parents to Rick's good eats, I've been wanting to go so bad for so long. Well, the wait was worth it, the food exceeded my expectations! The layers of the flavours on the loaded fries, wow I couldn't stop eating them, I really couldn't stop. My mother got the classic Mom's briyani which, also was filled with layers of flavours. My father got the butter chicken mac n' cheese, very very good. It was so so so delicious, my parents and I were already discussing on the way back home what we are going to get the next time we go. The staff was so nice, they were very kind. Great time. Marvellous food."}
{"text":"I watched Rick win season 2 of Recipe to Riches with his butter chicken lasagne. So great to find out he opened his own restaurant. 

This out of the way spot in a commercial plaza on Kennedy is well appointed and the food is a lot of fun. Great Indian fusion dishes like butter chicken mac and cheese and a grilled cheese on naan with tandoori bacon. Yeah, tandoori bacon. Deelish.

The samosas are hand made, we watched Rick's mom make them then took some to go. Really good. 

Only minor critique would be that some of the food is a bit heavy on the salt. We'll be back for sure, there's a lot more to try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love the place. We have been there twice and tried different options both times. I had the shahi paneer grilled cheese and my husband had the wings. The quality and quantity is great for the price you pay! Extremely recommonded!!"}
{"text":"I went in today, Mandy was my server at the counter. She was awesome! I got the beef burger, it was good. I upgraded to the chat fries... Worth it! 

I look forward to go back and try to the butter chicken mac and cheese. 

I did have a small mix up with my order, but the staff were super helpful and took care of it 

Good service, good food!"}
{"text":"As a self proclaimed foodie, I have respect for people who chefs who can venture into creative food fusion.   Ive rarely ever found a place that could do it right.   Today, i found the spot that has successfully married traditional Punjabi flavors with North American urban food culture.  Hats off to you and your staff Rick. 
I had the Punjabi cheeseburger, Tandoori fried chicken, and the loaded butter chicken fries. All three were spectacular.  I cant wait to go back, but this time with everyone i know."}
{"text":"Delicious fusion food, the burgers were juicy and savory, the poutine (fries were perfect, legitimately one of the best poutines ever)"}
{"text":"We just picked up the dosa burger and the rasmali cheesecake samosa.
I had no expectation of the place but was very happy with both my orders
 The cheeseburger was so good as  Iwas having such a good veg burger after a long time 
 with the perfect blend of the patty with the spices and the dressing it was really tasty 

The cheesecake samosa was very well done with right amount sweetness  without 
lingering in the mouth for a long time .It was crisp on the outside and very moist in the inside Loved it!!

Will definitely go there again"}
{"text":"Unbelievable food. Got to meet Rick himself who is so friendly. Staff helped us decide what to order and made awesome recommendations. Everything was clean and tidy. Some rad art on the walls as well. I'll be going back soon."}
{"text":"Great food!! Maybe they should ask what should go on the burgers. Excellent flavours!!"}
{"text":"Just got home from enjoying a Cheeseburger with bacon. Definitely one of the best burgers I've had.  I will be going back and trying more of the menu. 
I will be recommending Ricks to friends"}
{"text":"We walked in because of good review. We really liked the quality of the food, with good presentation, and large portion. Staff were also helpful. I strongly suggest this place."}
{"text":"Rick's Good Eats - has real good food especially the loaded fries. The staff is real courteous and helpful with good music, and a plus with the restroom that are clean."}
{"text":"Just left and want to go back already! 
This place was soooooo good 
We had the loaded butter chicken fries, Tbolt, RFC burger and a sample of the mac and cheese. 
I can say that I loved everything I ate. 10/10 
The customer service was great very friendly and helpful. 
The food has a great amount of flavour without being to spicy or over bearing probably the best I had in a long time!   I know I am gushing about this place but I loved it!!!!! 
It's busy for a reason, but it's very quick."}
{"text":"Had the Punjabi burger combo with upgraded fries to butter chicken fries. This dish was amazing, best burger I have ever had, fries were just as good and food quantity was large. I would suggest sharing fries with someone as I found it more than I could eat on my own. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I had the Dosa Burger. It was amazing, bursting with flavours and then finished with Ras malai samosas. Man I am already planning my next visit. 


Great job Rick! Love the new digs."}
{"text":"I went to Ricks Good Eats and the service was amazing, very spacious place, clean, and the people serving us were so kind. Rick was very sweet. 

My mother had the Dosa Burger she said it was good, the only thing was that the bun can get a bit soggy but overall it was amazing.

I had the Shahi Paneer Naanwich, I absolutely loved it. No complaints whatsoever. The textures of the tomatoes and onions complimented the paneer which was well seasoned. Naan was crunchy and firm enough to prevent the sauces from making it soggy. Perfection.

We both shared the Shahi Paneer Loaded Fries. We loved it. It was similar to what was in the Shahi Paneer Naanwich, however the of the crunch and the tanginess hot banana peppers were key. The choice of fries were also impressive, they did not get soggy. 

I tried the strawberry guava pressed juice, also very yummy. I loved it. 

For the prices, the portion was VERY generous. Ricks little touches such as the instruction card for heating up the frozen dinners were very clever and considerate. I picked up the butter chicken mac and cheese as well as the butter chicken lasagna which I have been drooling over ever since Recipes to Riches. I know it wont disappoint. This is feel good food, real comfort food, it feeds the soul. I will definitely recommend this to all my friends. Often times its SO disappointing to find certain restaurants be overrated, but this did NOT disappoint, its worth all the hype and needs more recognition. 

I definitely will come back to try the Apple Pie Samosas, the Punjabi Cheeseburger, Mom's Biriyani, and the Rasmalai cheesecake, perhaps after Navratri ends and Im not vegetarian.

You guys have to check this place out. I am so happy its in Mississauga, by my home. No complaints, will not disappoint. So happy to have tried this out! I posted it up on instagram and got a lot of people asking where it was from. Its rare to come across food that tastes as good as it looks, and this blew me away."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. I picked up the RFC (Rick's Fried Chicken) as well as the loaded fries and my GF got the Dosa burger. I must say I loved every thing I tried. I would definitely eat here again, awesome food!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing fusion of the best food known, burgers and the best cuisine out there, South East Asian - can't recommend this place enough for a great burger with a twist"}
{"text":"Great place to hang out and eat delicious fusion Indian food. The staff is extremely nice and the food is delicious. We ordered dosa burgers and samosa chat. Their fries are awesome. Check it out, put it on your to do list in Canada."}
{"text":"Had lunch today for the first time at Ricks. 
The food was flippin amazing! 
The butter chicken French fried were mouth watering delicious. The jerk chicken Somosa was so flavorful. Also had the Indian style burger and it was fantastic! 

Very impressed with this style of food. 
Will be back for sure!!! 

I think the tables need to be a bit bigger for all the food we ordered! Lol 

This restaurant is going to do really well in the long run!"}
{"text":"Went out of our way to go here because a friend told us it was delicious. Everything was tasty! We got the T Bolt, RFC (Rick's Fried Chicken) chat fries, dosa samosa, mango lassi and gobi cauliflower wings. If you're heading in or out to visit Toronto, it's worth the detour to go eat here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Friendly and fast service, reasonably priced, FABULOUS food! I had butter chicken and rice and the jerk chicken samosa."}
{"text":"Food tastes so fresh and great. Ordered couple of times in a week. Staff , food ,service , cleanliness, everything organized,quick ,well mannered. Best location in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came at 3 on a Wednesday and it was pretty quiet, Rick explained everything on the menu and it all sounded amazing. We ended up getting the Punjabi burger, Mac and cheese and loaded butter chicken fries. Generous portions at a fair price, we will definitely be returning. Thanks Rick!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and it was shortly after 12, but there was already a pretty long lineup. I was willing to wait it out because of the good reviews. I can't say the lineup moved super quick, but it wasn't unbearably slow. You order at the counter and then find a seat after your order.

They call out your name when your order is ready and they need to massively improve this system. First of all, one of the ladies calling out names was so quiet that none of us could hear her. Another lady calling out names mispronounced every name, even seemingly simple names. E.g. she called out \"Alissa\", so a Melissa had gone up, and the name was actually \"Alicia\". Maybe stick to order numbers instead.

I ordered the punjabi burger (no cheese) with bacon, masala fries, and a butter chicken samosa. This food was gloriously good. I was just shoving it into my mouth so quickly. 

The punjabi burger was a heavily seasoned burger patty that was topped with very flavourful sauces. This is not a burger for burger purists or people who don't like much spice or seasoning. The butter chicken samosa was crispy on the outside and luscious on the inside. Everything was divine. You will not be disappointed. Unless your name is Alicia."}
{"text":"Really great flavours, very fresh, lots of vegetarian options. Worth the trek for sure. Would go back anytime."}
{"text":"Even though we're New Yorkers we are regulars at Ricks Good Eats. Ricks is a true mix of the best of both worlds. 

Hypes
- rfc - ricks fried chicken. Imagine a tandoori battered fried chicken. Definitely on the op
Of my list
- if you haven't read any other reviews the butter chicken mac and cheese is bomb
- Punjabi cheeseburger is like a kebab. Fantastic. 
- dessert samosas...all of them
- chaat fries- definitely not what you'll expect but in the best way possible. 
- always extremely friendly helpful service. 
- sometimes there are people spinning live music! 


Gripes
- hard for this to be a gripe - but there is butter chicken in one too many things 
-limited seating."}
{"text":"Okay at best, after reading about all the reviews raving about the loaded fries with butter chicken, I couldn't pass on the opportunity when the time finally came. It definitely did not live up to the hype, very one note and I was bored of eating it after a couple bites. Will not be back for the loaded fries. On the way out, I grabbed a couple jerk chicken samosas, a bit on the expensive side but it was worth the try. Most likely will not be back again."}
{"text":"Finally went there a few weeks ago after hearing so much about it. They have their own Indo-Canadian cuisine, where they serve Canadian cuisine with Indian tadka.
I tried the Butter-Chicken/Rice combo with Jerk Chicken samosa. The Butter Chicken and Rice was just okay, considering the fact that Rick's is famous for it's butter chicken. I didn't understand why.
The Jerk Chicken samosa was different and tasty. It was pulled jerk chicken stuffed in a samosa. It tasted pretty good.
Wifey ordered Dosa Burger with masala fries. Dosa burger was tasty. Even though the bun was cold and presentation sucked, the filling inside made up for it. The fries accompanying the burger looked like costco fries with a kick to it. They were just okay.

I may visit them again if I'm in the area but I'll not go out of my way to eat here at all. They were rather pricey considering it's a self service location and the quantity/presentation of the food."}
{"text":"O-M-G ....I need a moment to just reflect on the amazingness that I just ate!



Been wanting to try this place, finallllllllyyyyy it's gone in my belly and now I'm feeling oh-so-satisfied! 

Do you like Indian food? burgers? Fries? Sandwiches? Wings? Ummmm hello, you will love it here!! The shitty part about being a foodie and eating by yourself is, you're limited to how much food you can try (unless you can really eat)....but the best part about having friends and family who love to eat just as much as you is, that you can try so many things on the menu! 

We ordered loaded butter chicken fries, veggie samosa chaat, dosa burger, Punjabi burger and the cheesecake samosa....all of it = YUM! My favourite and MUST TRY is the butter chicken fries *drool*, sooooooo effing good! It's an item I'll definitely order every time! That's right, I'm gonna make it a point to try everything on this menu!

UGH. I CAN'T"}
{"text":"I was initially debating to try this place as its the same old theme east meets west fusion food. WOW! if this place can make vegetarian items this good, I can only image how other items might be. Alas, they don't serve halal meat. 

I went to check out the place with some coworkers and it was jam packed. We were lucky to find a place to sit, so go early or a little late during work lunches. 

Foodwise, I ordered there grilled shahi paneer naanwich. It was a pressed panini sandwich filled with marinated paneer crushed in with sauce and achari mayo. 

Instead of fries I upgraded to their loaded fries (which was a meal in its self). The masala fries were topped with cheese, crushed Shahi Paneer, and jalapeno. Both items were so good that you could not stop stuffing them.

Great idea with great fusion and all tasty!"}
{"text":"Great Indian fusion food. The rasmalai samosas are Delish! As were the burgers... butter chicken Mac and cheese was yummy but heavy as you would expect. Better to share that one"}
{"text":"Indian meet Burgers and fries.  Amazing.  Must try.  Load fries with butter chicken was great.  Punjabi burger was delicious.  Homemade Samosas."}
{"text":"Amazing loaded fries!  Best ever samosas!Very clean. Very modern. Very friendly. Lots of good reviews from yelp brought me here and I was not disappointed. Great experience!!!"}
{"text":"Good food. The butter chicken samosas and the RFC were both great. Staff is very friendly and Rick himself stopped by the table for a chat. Will be back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"i had always knew Rick was an amazing chef, from trying the butter chicken Lasagna to seeing his creative styles on instagram this restaurant was a definite MUST on my list.

My friends and i decided to come here for our annual christmas dinner and my socks were blown off my feet! 

i love the ambience of the place, its not your typical joint and it's got an awesome downtown feel to it.

we went late friday night and it was super busy, but understandable why it was.

i got the jerk chicken samosa chat and it was soooo good. i traded a samosa with my friend so i got to try the butter chicken one as well, and i have to say that is definitely my fav! 

i also stole food from my friends, the tandoori bacon, the loaded fries and the BOLT was on my list of items to try again! 

my tastebuds loved this place and needless to say, i will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here last night for dinner with my friends. 
We ordered a variation of foods. 
Punjabi burger - was really good flavour. However it fell apart due to the overly soft bun. The bun needs to be changed to something that will accommodate such a juicy burger. It has tons of flavour.  And I could especially taste the mint. But really didn't not like the bun.
Butter chicken fries was amazing.  The butter chicken was really fresh.
Paneer naanwich - although I did not taste it. My friend said it was really good. 
Butter chicken mac n cheese - the taste was phenomenal but the macaroni pasta was way too over cooked."}
{"text":"Unreal food, could eat their samosas all day. Highly recommend if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"What a find.  Great food and friendly service.  They both go hand in hand!  
I had the Punjabi Cheeseburger and Masala fries and it was delicious.  I didn't know that these flavours could be presented in a burger form until I came to this place.  The burger was nice and juicy with just enough spices. The fries where crispy and spices kicked it up a notch.  
You may want to come here earlier if it's during lunch hours.  I wished there were more seats and tables, but you can always take out.
You got to eat here!"}
{"text":"Whoa, what a concept. Junk/comfort food fused with traditional Indian flavours, holy Hera!

I've been creepin' on Ricks Yelp page pretty hard (no but like a stalker, for real) for some time now, I'd heard the hype about his good eats from TV, the news and then more recently as a supplier of gourmet samosa's to other local restaurants - Mac'N Cheese, in a Samosa #blessed!

Today, I happened to be in an area of Brampton/Mississauga where there really is nothing to eat and upon scoping Yelp I realised it was a mere 2 km from my meetings. Pretty tough luck when a 5-star spot like this is the only and best option in your area, it's like saying all you have are million dollar bills, darn it!

I cruised in and scoped the menu, duuuuuuuude. What? Butter chicken mac'n cheese? Punjabi cheeseburgers? Masala Fries with or without Chaat? Phewwwwwww *snaps fingers together*

Service was super helpful and recommended that as I first timer I had to do the Punjabi Cheeseburger with Masala Fries (just regular fries sprinkled with Masala seasoning). Done, easy! Cost - not important, maybe $12-15, I don't remember.

Waited for a short time for my order to be made fresh and when it came I was beyond excited. I unwrapped the burger and the familiar fragrant Indian spice smells hit me like a ton of bricks. Amazing. The first bite was equally awesome, the taste and combination of cheese, bacon, beef and Indian spice blend was outstanding. A truly one-of-a-kind burger experience in terms of creativity and flavour.

My one critique was in the presentation and sogginess of the burger bun. My burger had only gone from the kitchen to my tray to my table, yet the bun was soggy either from over steaming or grease and was basically smashed together. I was hungry and the flavours, as I've said, were on point, so I wasn't going to complain about aesthetics, but as a word of constructive feedback, the burger should look as good as it tastes (when possible) especially so for customers who are dining in. All bets are off if you take out.

As someone else mentioned, the french fries bore a resemblance to the crispy battered Kirkland brand french fries you can purchase from COSTCO. They may not have been but the taste and texture were exact. The fries were a real let down for me both in that they were not fresh and that there wasn't even a hint of masala flavouring on them. Fries are not why I came here but as a side, they should have and could have been executed a bit better to round out this tasty meal.

Overall, I give the flavours and smells of the burger, the friendliness of the staff and the concept 4/5 but have removed 0.5 for sogginess of the bun/presentation of the burger and 0.5 for the bland not-so-masala-masala-fries. Neither of which are major issues and I'm more than happy to add a full star back on my next visit when I try some of their other delicious sounding treats!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I had heard about this place/Rick for a few years on various social media outlets, which is why I was extremely excited to go but worried that it might not live up to the hype. It was AMAZING! Rick has done such a seamless job in meshing different flavors and cuisines together. The Butter chicken mac n cheese is to DIE FOR and the butter chicken samosa chaat was amazing as well. Bacon lovers need to try the tandoori bacon and vegetarians have to go for the dosa burger. 

Only minor complaint- we wanted to order more samosas but they ran out  
My biggest advice- go with a couple friends or go on a completely empty stomach so that you can try everything like I did

Icing on the cake- Got to meet Rick himself!!! What a humble and kind guy, thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"i love that they have non-vegetarian items on the menu - most Indian fusion places are vegetarian.  Tried the T-Bolt and Chaat Fries and both were VERY well made.  Rick was in-house with his mom,wife and aunt so the place was PACKED.  I'm going back tomorrow with my mom for Mother's Day so I'm super psyched LOL
Oh, i ordered the channa, cheesburger and rasmalai samosas (3 for $5!) and they were very tasty.  Thumbs up all the way - you guys are doing a great job! Now EXPAND already so everyone gets seating! LOL"}
{"text":"Perfect fusion of Indian food and 'fast food'. I've also been wanting to go here for so long, finally tried it!

We had the shahi paneer naanwich- some deliciously creamy, spiced paneer (cubed cottage cheese) curry, sandwiches between two crisp pieces of naan glued together with cheese. YUM! We had it with a side of masala fries, also good!

The Gobi wings were delicious! Long before the current trend of fried cauliflower, Indians have been making deep fried cauliflower for centuries--- because it's delicious!! This was definitely elevated by the dash of achar mayo and sprinkle of sesame seeds.

We also tried the jerk chicken samosa which and delicious!! 

Overall, I would come here again when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Was in the Toronto area for business and this was by far the best place I ate at. I am from the SF Bay Area where fusion foods of all types are popular - and this place blows them away. Unreal"}
{"text":"Mixture of Indian and Canadian food. Had the tandoori chicken burger. The underused sweet sauce and the overused white sauce made the food less appetizing than it could have been. The fries and samosas were alright, nothing great. Based on the price and location, it doesn't seem worth another visit. 

The room isn't big enough to fit all the people waiting, but the service is fine. Overall, it's okay."}
{"text":"Had the Butter Chicken Mac/Cheese
Absolutely Stellar, great atmosphere , very friendly staff. Have recommend Ricks to many of my colleagues as we work very close. They had other dishes and raved as well. Ricks is a diamond in the ruff. Keep up the creativity Rick \" GREAT JOB \""}
{"text":"Mediocre burger which has some indian spices to it. Fries wasn't that great especially without the ketchup they didn't provide for take out. It was very annoying to find out they didn't bother giving me napkins"}
{"text":"It was so so. I came by here with a few of my cousins for dinner, since it had great reviews and had an interesting twist on indian food.

I wasn't too impressed with the menu - every options seemed to have been missing something. But either way, I tried a couple things from the menu and it tasted like what you expect - it was indian food with some canadian twist to it. I felt that it was a bit pricey though (we also got some samosas and they were so-so as well). It was a cool idea, and I've not seen a fusion like this before, but this spot is a bit out of the way and it didn't really live up to the hype. Probably won't be back unless they open a downtown location or something."}
{"text":"The Punjabi burger was huge and full of flavor. I have never experienced the flavor before and was amazed at the complexity of it. The fries with the combo were crunchy and quite addicting. I could eat them everyday if I could.

The staff was really nice and food was up quick.

This place lives up to their name ... Good Eats!"}
{"text":"Went with 3 colleagues who were visiting from the US - thought they might like the combo of Comfort Food mixed with Indian flavours. We tried basically everything, hah!

The TBOLT was everyone's favourite by a mile. 

The cauliflower \"wings\" were also a dream.

Great lunch spot! Can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I made my first trip today, though I'd been to Rick's popup samosa shop at Briskit back when that was a thing. We had the butter chicken fries, chaat fries, a salad (I forget the name but it had tandoori chicken galore,) and the gobi \"wings\". And of course, the special apple pie samosa!

Everything was really wonderful! I wasn't really surprised, given that I'd had their food before in another venue, but it was nice to finally get a chance to enjoy the new place.

The ingredients are fresh, the taste is flavourful without being overpowering. A nice level of moderate to medium spice, too. Cute interior: simple, but super clean and pleasant. 

The staff were also very gracious and patient as we figured out our order.

I definitely plan to bring my husband here soon so he can also try it out. This place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Been wanting to check this place out for a while now and finally got the opportunity to. We ordered the Punjabi burger, butter chicken mac n' cheese, and the beef samosas. All I can say is EXPLOSION OF FLAVOUR. Everything exceeded our expectations and our favourite was definitely the mac n cheese. We will definitely return to try the loaded fries and the tbolt."}
{"text":"Lunch @ Rick's Good Eat, ordered dosa burger, patty was excellent, taste so good, but wish had better healthy version of bread to go with it. The jerk chicken samosa is bold and strong flavoured, but could be less salty, still nice one to try. Service was very good. Will come back and try other dishes"}
{"text":"OMG - I had seen the pics and read the reviews. So expectations were high. As a self-proclaimed Indian food lover (and expert), I have a high bar. This was AMAZING - it cleared my bar and went even further. 

We shared a couple items - the cauliflower and the fries (Indian veg poutine) and boy. I can't wait until I go back. 

Try it - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Went on the Saturday and to make it short and sweet, I had the Pataka Wings that were just amazing. I fell in love with the Ras Malai Cheesecake Samosa. 

Met Rick himself, very humble and attentive to his customers.

Overall amazing experience from the service to the food.

Definitely recommend checking it out"}
{"text":"I drove to Mississauga for this and it was worth it! 
The restaurant is very nicely renovated and the staff were super nice and gracious - especially Rick!

We ordered:
Chicken Briyani combo with a samosa and a drink $13
Butter Chicken Mac and Cheese Combo with a samosa and drink 
RFC sandwich Combo with Fries and a Drink 

They were all super delicious, flavourful and filling! (We got combos for all of them). You can really taste the intricate spices used for all the dishes! It felt like a party in my mouth. 

There were big chunks of chicken in the biriyani but not so much in the mac and cheese so if there was, this would be a 5 star review!

I will def be returning to try the other items - like the butter chicken loaded fries!"}
{"text":"Really great fusion food.  Had the Punjabi burger, butter chicken & jerk chicken samosa along with the paneer loaded fries.  All of them were seriously special and crazy good.  Staff was really helpful and patient as we ordered.  Great place and will be back here when I come to town."}
{"text":"A couple coworkers and I had been talking about going to Ricks, so we finally made it happen. Just as we were about to leave, another half dozen or so workers wanted to join in, so the pressure was on for Rick's to deliver (well figuratively, though perhaps they do home delivery as well).

Though I was excited to try it, I had a nagging sense of doubt whether it would be all that great. I think I was wondering if it would be gimmicky, or whether the attempts at fusion would fall short - leaving it not up to standard to Indian flavour or Western form.

Before my order even arrived, my reservations were already being dispelled. Two ordered chicken Biryani which looked so fresh and gorgeous. They confirmed as much once they began to eat. A couple others began digging into the butter chicken macaroni and were singing its praises instantly.

I ordered the Punjabi cheeseburger. From the description on the menu, it appeared as though it may just be a fairly normal cheeseburger, but with a mayo fused with Indian spices. However, I was told that the beef was made with Punjabi seasoning, and once I began to dig in, it was abundantly clear that this was a whole new experience. I would almost liken the beef taste to a kabob since it had large variety of seasoning - though that can only give you part of the picture. Every thing about it worked so well, and there was something wonderful about eating something so familiar, yet completely new.

Everything here is also incredibly fresh (at least I can vouch for lunch) and I saw them making samosas right in the front. The samosas btw, were also a huge hit for those who ordered them.

There's more that I could go on, including the great layout, friendly staff, and the fantastic value. All in all, Rick has knocked it out of the park and successfully managed a fusion of food that few have even considered, let alone attempted."}
{"text":"Nothing but deliciousness... Had their butter chicken Mac and cheese and I can't stop thinking about it. This place is the real deal. I recommend it to anyone looking for something adventurous to try..."}
{"text":"We went to RGE for lunch on May 8. We had:  The punjabi cheeseburger, samosa chaat, butterchicken Mac& Cheese, rasmalai samosa, and for take out: Mom's Biryani, 6 samosas.

The decor is hip. The idea is great. Unfortunately the above came to about $70 and was lacklustre. The quality vs value equity is lost here. 

The cheeseburger was good. the samosa chaat was basic. Butterchicken Mac had almost zero chicken in it, but lots of sauce. The Biryani was mostly onions. The samosas are priced differently for veg versus meat (veg is cheaper) meat= $15 for 6. veg = $10 for 6.  I got a mix of veg and meat and I was charged as if they were all meat. I asked why, they had no answer. The samosas are SUPER deep fried to the point you can see the oil bubbles on them. Little filling. Pretty salty. 

It was a new experience and the food is diner like with an indian twist. Worth a one time visit."}
{"text":"What an awesome experience! Love the generous portion sizes and the price- it all adds up! 
We had the RFC, Loaded Fries and Chaat Masala Fries!!! So good! Totally recommend it! If you're far.... make the hike...its worth it!"}
{"text":"Indian fusion is the new hype!! and I am all for it.

Tucked away in an industrial area in Ssauga is a restaurant who's reputation is spreading like wild flower. I was actually shocked when I found out that their closing time was 7.30. However made it there in a hurry after work to hear what all the talk is about.

Their menu was on the chalkboard and as a group of 3- we decided to pretty much pick up as many things and try them all, ended up ordering the following from favorite to least favorite:

1) The Punjabi Cheeseburger- the flavor of the burger was very similar to an reshmi kebab, an over sized and soft tender meat served on a steam bun- was great!!!. It was excellent and I could have ordered 2 for myself but the price was a little too steep to do so.

2) Chaat Fries- overlooking the fact that these were definitely costco Kirkland fries (which I LOVE!!)- that chaat topping was phenomenal. Almost a perfect combination that I couldn't believe this dish has not been already saturated in this poutine crazed town. Highly recommended

3) Butter Chicken Mac n Cheese- I liked it, the combination of 2 very rich dishes was a scary thought. However I believe that the name lived up to itself. As i did get best of both worlds. My only qualm was that it was served with a scoop of a special indian styled coleslaw which was positioned right in the middle on top of my MAC n Cheese. I would prefer the coleslaw on the side as it was conflicting with the taste of the butter chicken which was creamy and milky. The coleslaw being vinegar based would end up in my fork- and I could not avoid it.

4) Jerk Chicken Samosa- My social media feed went crazy for this- notifications saying \"WHAT IS THAT FAM?\" ...\" THAT LOOKS BLESSSED\"...\"NOOO WAAAY....WHERE???!!??\".
TBH- it was good. Not something i would try on the regular- it was pretty much just pulled jerk chicken in a samosa wrap. However - if you are a social media like whore such as me. It does have its dividend's.

5) Rasmalai Samosa- the item I was looking forward the most ended up disappointing me the most. What I was expecting: a sweet dessert packed with rasmalai that looked dangerous to eat as one bit would gush out the rasmalai juice and fill my mouth with sweeet sweet nectar.
What I recieved: pasty wrapped into a a tiny samosa shape- with very little rasmalai inside..almost like it was spread. Maybe it was a bad batch- maybe my expectations were too high- but definitely took an L. dont bother - get another punjabi cheeseburger instead! 

I did enjoy this place- might stop by again if I am in the area."}
{"text":"Incredible. 

Really innovative food at a reasonable price in a clean and hip location. The whole menu is bursting with creativity that begs repeat visits to try all the items. 

The burger was so unique, and the butter chicken fries were fantastic. 

If you are up for a culinary adventure look no further."}
{"text":"WHOA. RICKS Good Eats.... amazing. Yum. Deeeelishush. If you love fresh new takes on standard comfort food classics..... you NEED to try this place out. I had the Naan grilled cheese and the loaded bytter chicken fries. It took me 2 days to eat it all. So good. I literally crammed this food into my mouth. I think I was eating like cookie monster. Complete with nom mom noms. Do pay attention to the other reviews.... limited seating, so call ahead for your order. That's what I did and even though there was a lineup I used a food ordering app and walked in...and boom. Food was ready and waiting. No tables at all so I just took it home, drooling the whole way. I did eat the veggie samosa in the car. I had my own When Sally Met Harry moment....i have never had such a light , buttery, salty, gorgeous samosa in my life. Super glad I was on my own because the noises i was making while eating weren't decent :) I can't wait to go back and try more!!!"}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto on business and came across this spot. I've never had any type of Indian food before, so I decided to step outside of my comfort zone...and I'm very glad I did.

I ordered the Punjabi burger w/bacon and it was AMAZING. I've never tasted flavors like this, much less on a burger. Get some extra napkins because this one is messy. The fires you can get if you order a combo are like a battered fry with some special seasonings and they were also very good.

I will definitely return if I'm ever in the Toronto area again one day. Now I need to find a place like this in Dallas...if one exists."}
{"text":"Holy smokes!!! This review is being written as soon as I've left this place... yes I'm in the parking lot.  

Amazing amazing amazing meal.. probably the best I've had in a  while. It's a perfect fusion between western fast food an a beautiful twist of South Asian flavours. 

This is perfect for those of us that feel like we need to drown our western dishes in hot sauce .. you'll appreciate this place! They have a variety of meat and vegetarian dishes. I had the Vegetarian Naanwhich which felt like a grilled cheese with Paneer. It was served with fries (ask for masala fries instead) and the Achar Mayo!! 

The place was CLEAN including the bathrooms - spotless. The service was IMPECCABLE. The girl taking my order was so passionate about the food.. she couldn't help me make up my mind!! Got to meet Rick himself who is such s friendly soul - he confesses the secrets are the works of him and his mother ..what an amazing collaboration... theres nothing like this out of there."}
{"text":"What to say other than delicious! Great food and great service. Come early to avoid the lunch rush. Samosas and the Dosa burger are personal favourites but everything is great!"}
{"text":"Came here to this indian fusion place for the first time with the girlfriend after training for an early dinner. At first, there were only one or two tables so we were starting to get a little worried. Our worry was soon forgotten when we couldn't decide what we wanted to try first. Everything sounded great on the menu. 

Eventually, we decided on the paneer loaded fries, the butter chicken samosa, chicken biryani, the cheesecake samosa, and mango laksi. Everything was freshly made, mouth watering, tasty, flavorful, and delicious. The loaded paneer fries were extremely loaded and yet fries were still crispy. This butter chicken samosa was definitely the best one I ever had in Canada. The best part is that it isn't saucy so it was also a very clean and easy eat. Chicken briyani rice was made perfectly and full of flavors. Finally,  the cheesecake samosa had a great texture and was so yummy with a hint of...  chai. Of course, chai had to be incorporated. Haha!!

I definitely recommend this place. Can't wait to be back when I'm in the area. There's still many things I want to try on the menu. Any suggestions what to try next?  (??)"}
{"text":"The food was amazing!!! We tried the Dosa burgers and asked them to make it vegan and they did and it was yummmyy. samosa chaat was pretty good too. Will surely be back soon !!"}
{"text":"We ordered from this place while working late at the office last week through skip the dishes. We ordered four meals and four drinks at 6 pm. The food arrived with one meal and drink missing.The receipt showed we were charged for four meals and drinks. The bag had no condiments or cutlery. I guess we are supposed to eat kachumber salad with our hands, fries without any ketchup and require no napkins to wipe our faces. The skip driver told us to complain to the restaurant. When we called, the restaurant had already closed at 7 pm. My boss logged an email complaint with both skip and the restaurant and heard back from neither. Will never be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Had the butter chicken fries which was really good. Me and my wife also shared a Punjabi burger and a shahi naanwich. We weren't really fond of the taste of either one."}
{"text":"What a food and hospitality! A must place for foodies. The masala fries   were crunchy and delicious. The Dosa burger was amazing; you can taste dosa in the sandwich. Innovative and a perfect fusion. 
Butter chicken and rice was super delicious. Reminded me of one of the best butter chickens I had in India. I still have to try their desert somosa (filling if cheesecake and Ras Malawi). This joint take you to another level of food pleasure. 
Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"Came in because they had some great reviews. Though the menu was a bit interesting then what I'd usually go for, it definitely didn't disappoint!  My friend got the Punjab Cheese Burger and I got the Ricks Fried Chicken combos -- tho I can't speak for the burger, the RFC was amazing. I was disappointed when I was getting close to finishing. Rick and his family were also super welcoming and friendly, giving us samples of some of the items -- the butter chicken and mac (and just the butter chicken) was also extremely tasty. Highly recommend and would definitely swing back again if I'm back in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"I came here with my girlfriend and the server was very rude I ordered the Punjabi burger and it was meh. The people look dirty and the whole restaurant smelt like a strong curry and not the good kind! Save ur money and just go to Wendy's across the street"}
{"text":"Let me start this by saying it's 4:52am currently, I haven't slept much, the need to visit the washroom (la throne) has kept me awake after eating one of Rick's beef burger with achari mayo. I became sick pretty much right after I consumed the to go burger I ordered. Why am I giving two stars instead of one is because of the concept of fusing your regular Indian food to American comfort food. It was essentially just a beef keema burger patty (beef mixed with traditional Indian spices) , with regular mayonnaise avec Indian pickle spices, and regular lettuce, tomato on a soft bun. It's what Normal people would make after we have kebab night and their is leftover mince, so we make a burger out of it. The place was pretty much empty once I walked in however the loud music was enough to distract the employee's not to greet me right away. For the price of each item listed on the menu it's not worth. It is however worth a visit once since not many restaurants are doing this sort of food. Having said that, if you were to really observe the menu, it's straight forward to make any of these dishes fraction of the cost. What you are paying for is the concept. I would not be going back because I prefer to have night where I am not holding onto my stomach from bad food."}
{"text":"We tried the dosa burger , Punjabi cheese burger and T-BOLT. The masala fries are simple but cool concept.... the butter chicken fries are awesome !! Loved the fact Rick came by to say hello to each table. Great experience to a chillaxed place. Perfect CanIndian combination .... btw he is the winner of the Recipe to Riches competition and is winning recipe was butter chicken lasagne."}
{"text":"Ok this place is pretty fabulous. If you're adventurous definitely give out a try. Inventive and well executed Indian fusion ideas. Don't choose between the fries and the samosas, bring a buddy and try them all."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to make a trip to Toronto to fill our bellies with good food for the Thanksgiving holiday. On our way, we decided to drop by Ricks based on its trendy foods and great reviews. I would have to say, I was not disappointed and very satisfied. We decided to try out as many items on the menu as possible. We ordered the Punjabi burger, RFC sandwich, Dosa burger, loaded butter chicken fries, chickpea and meat samosas. Oh my goodness, everything was just outstanding. The punjabi burger was juicy, and packed with amazing flavors that separated this burger from every other burger I've had to date. The Rick's fried chicken burger was also just so dang good. The fried and crispy outside with juicy hot meat inside was made to perfection. The achari mayo and ting tang sauce utilized in the sandwiches made the difference. So goood. Unfortunately, I could not try the dosa burger as my friend had gulfed it down before I could take a photo or snag a bite. By the looks of it, he definitely enjoyed it. As for the loaded butter chicken fries, bombbbbskies. Although, I was starting to get full, I'm glad to have stuffed my face with the pile of hot, juicy, and buttery chicken fries. And to top it off, hot fresh samosas. Overall, LOVED this place, it definitely lived up to my expectations and the reviews. If I am ever in the area, I will have to come back and try a bunch of the other items on the menu. Super nice staff as well."}
{"text":"Suggested this place for a recent meeting with the Young Leaders Council last week!

First impression of the restaurant was business lunch meets comfy & casual hangout! 

The food is exactly that, comfort like how your folks make it with a modern twist on it!

They had 2 veggie options for entrees, dosa burger and Grilled Shahi paneer & Masala Fries. 

I got the latter and didn't regret a single bite. The naan on the ouside was crisp and study enough to hold the sandwich together. The inside was flavorful and tasted fresh and warm. The fries were crisp until the last one and the simple but bomb seasoning made them! Soooo filling I gave my second half to my friend. Nice touch on the jalape√±os! 

 Also picked up one of their fresh juices, size is a bit smaller than other juicers in sauga but delicious none the less. 

Last thing out of the gate was their rasmalai cheesecake samosas dusted in cinnamon ****drool 

The service was spot on, friendly neighborhood and got to chat with Rick himself! They were sweet enough to let us order the samosas after they closed...I scheduled a mtg there at 7pm forgetting they close at 730 Thursday 'doh'

Will be back at this rare spot for delicious, affordable and innovative food!"}
{"text":"Cool place for Indian meets Canadian food. It's neat to see butter chicken mac and cheese and all sorts of interesting samosa flavours. 
I ordered the byriyani dish and it was half decent. The flavours were bright and the dish was filling. The presentation was literally an over flowing small dish of food. It was a mess to try to eat since all the rice kept falling on the table since it was overflowing. My husband says the samosas were amazing. 
The Punjabi burger was ok. Great spices added to the burger patty but other than that, the burger was just ok in flavour. The fries are freezer fries. Nothing special. 
Over all I would go back. The food was good. But not great"}
{"text":"This place was pretty awesome. The restaurant is relatively new, clean with simple modern decor. You are greeted by a large chalkboard menu when you enter and place your order at the counter and before taking a seat. I ordered the Punjabi Cheeseburger with Tandoori Bacon and Masala fries. The burger was juicy, loaded with spices and herbs. Seriously one of the better burgers I've had in a while. Only knock was that the fries were a little too salty for my taste. Others guests in my group ordered the Butter Chicken Loaded Fries and Butter Chicken Mac-N-Cheese. Everyone was impressed with the the quality of the food and the Indian fusion twist on some classics was impressive. Definitely a place we will visit again. I hear their samosas are really really good, will need to try next time."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Finally a fantastic, inventive and reasonably priced place in the GTA. We came here a couple weeks ago on a Friday night. The staff was great, the food came in a timely manner and the atmosphere is very laid back. I got the dosa burger and paneer fries. Holy smokes, I was honestly blown away. The fries were quite possibly my fav fries I have ever had and I am all about trying new French fry concoctions. The dosa burger, mixing two things I love dearly: dosa and burgers, what more could a girl ask for? Watch out it is a messy one though ! My boyfriend got some kind of grilled cheese with bacon and jalape√±os, I was too busy inhaling my food to ask him what his was called lol. I am so excited to come back here and bring my friends. A+ Rick!"}
{"text":"I'll just say that.. I have a very low tolerance for spicy food (banana peppers being the limit ), so it was painful for me, but the food is so good that I could not stop eating. I had the Dosa burger, I never knew potato patty burger could be so amazing. The butter chicken loaded fries were also great. 
We are rarely in that area, but definitely looking forward coming back for more meals! 
Butter chicken fries were not spicy at all if you avoid the jalape√±o peppers."}
{"text":"I've had Rick's in my bookmarks for a while but didn't expect to get a chance to go there anytime soon since I live far from the area. So when I kinda unexpectedly happened to be in Brampton on a weekday I thought I had to stop by for lunch. The place from outside looks like a fast-food joint (reminded me of a Shake Shack) but the moment you step and smell the Indian spices you realize it is not your typical fast food joint. There was a big line up for lunch and it took about 15 min to place my order. I got the Punjabi burger to go. And it took another 15-20min to get the food. After all that waiting I must say I'm glad I was patient. The burger was amazing. Awesome mix of Indian flavors in a juicy melt-in-your-mouth burger. My only regret was that I wished I had bought two. 
The food is slightly on the pricier side but overall it was worth it. Just remember if you're going for lunch make sure you have time as they seem to be pretty busy.

Food: 4.5/5
Service and atmosphere: 4/5
Price:4/5
Overall: 4/5"}
{"text":"Pretty great food! I got the dosa burger with the loaded masala fries and cheesecake samosa and I really enjoyed it all. My friends got the Paneer lasagna special which was great, and the butter chicken Mac and cheese, Yum! Have to say I still prefer traditional Indian food, but this was different and very enjoyable. Plus the staff were super friendly which made the experience that much better. Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Loved the food! The fries chaat was delicious and very interesting. The RFC sandwich was absolutely delicious! Definitely something I know I will always crave. The Punjabi burger was nothing special in terms of the patty. It was just like eating a kebab in a burger form but what makes it amazing was all the sauces they put on top! Their chutneys were also amazing! I wanted a little extra chutney for my sandwich and they were charging $1.00 for it. Wasn't a fan of that. Otherwise, the place was amazing! Will definitely be back for the fries chaat, samosas and the RFC sandwich!"}
{"text":"This rating is a 4.5 almost perfect they do the Indian Canadian Fusion so well

I ordered the Dosa Burger combo with an upgraded drink to the mango lassi honestly I did not need the fries the burger is super filling it's a potato Patty with curry seasoning and onions tomato etc it is Flavor explosion you can taste the authentic Indian spices but you still have that Western feel of a burger I was Super full I couldn't finish my food I felt Superbad throwing it away but I knew I wasn't going to eat it later honestly you won't regret stopping by here the mango lassi was so delicious so fresh I recommend

The only complaint I have is they can add more seating there's lots of room for more seating when I got there there wasn't much seating because tables were reserved for larger groups as well as the music the music was not censored they were playing trap and Hip Hop and there was a lot of swearing which if you are someone who is uncomfortable with hearing a lot of swearing it's not the nicest atmosphere to be in"}
{"text":"I can't stop singing praises for Rick's. His fusion Indian-Canadian dishes are culinary genius. I mean... tandoori bacon? Grilled cheese BLT using crispy Naan bread?? Butter chicken mac and cheese???  Each bite into my meal sent a chorus of heavenly song through me. 

I personally wish the chunks of butter chicken in the Mac and cheese were a bit bigger, but to each their own. Although the samosas were fried to crispy perfection. Beautiful and unlike any samosa I've ever had. 

Also, the staff was extremely friendly, and Rick himself came around to ask each table how their meal was. Amazing overall experience! I will be back again... and again... and again."}
{"text":"OMG is all I can say! There aren't enough adjectives to describe how good the food was. My husband and I tried the butter chicken fries, TBolt and Punjabi Cheeseburger. It was all excellent! Perfectly spiced and seasoned, came out in great time and hot! My husband is Italian and I'm Punjabi, and it perfectly met both our tastes. 

Service was great and friendly, Rick and his wife specifically take their time to say hello, make recommendations and say thanks and goodbye. We will definitely be back again! 

Being a Canadian born Indian, my many thanks to Rick for actualizing all my food fantasies.

The only complaint my husband and I have, we wish we could eat more! The Punjabi Fried Chicken feature looked delicious, we regret not trying it"}
{"text":"What an amazing place to go eat at. My second time here. The flavors of perfectly executed cuisine await you as soon as you open the door. The samosas are over the top tasty and beautifully prepared. The butter chicken mac n'cheese is another one of my favorites. Having enjoyed lunch with smaller groups, I got to see a nice selection of foods out of this place and everyone was thrilled with the flavors and portions alike. If you're in the area and have room in your belly, you need to stop in here. I can only recommend it."}
{"text":"Amazing fusion food here. Personally had the Punjabi cheeseburger, and chaat fries while my wife had the naan-wich (paneer) and our group had the cauliflower wings, butter chicken mac-n-cheese, dosa burger, and loaded fries. For dessert we all shared the apple pie samosas. Will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Amazing spot and I can't wait to go back. Western comfort food meets exotic Indian flavours. We had the butter chicken mac and cheese plus the T-Bolt sandwich. The mac and cheese was a perfect combo and the ultimate comfort food (would love to see a fully loaded version with maybe some cilantro and tandoori bacon). The T-Bolt perfectly crispy naan and gooey in the middle. Plus TANDOORI BACON! Amazing, just wow. The samosas were equally mind-blowing. Also the staff was really friendly and nice. Definitely need to go back. This place is a must try!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Ricks and I have to say I think I found one of my new favourite places !
The food is amazing ! Everything looks so good !
I tried the butter chicken Mac n cheese and some wings with the masala fries and man was it ever amazing !! The loaded fries looked so good to I can't wait to go back and try those !
The staff is very friendly and helpful .
I came around noon on a Saturday and it was super busy hard to get a table but I got one ! 
Give them a try they are amazing !"}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect but this place is SO GOOD. I expected fusion south Asian food but the flavoured were all there. I went there with my girlfriend and we wanted to order everything, but we controlled ourselves - 
We had the butter chicken samosas, moms biryani, and paneer loaded fries. 

The samosas were fried to order and they were so tasty- it was a thin wrapping with bits of chicken with the curry seasoning, moist but not saucy. 
Moms biryani was made perfectly - great spice and the rice wasn't soggy or hard. Really addictive.
Oh the paneer fries... that's the one that surprised me the most. I've had butter chicken fries at other places (ok New York fries don't judge) and wasn't too impressed. These on the other hand because of how they make their masala and the toppings worked so well together. The fries were also super crunchy. 
They were also so nice and gave us a fried cheesecake on the house since they added onions on my fries when I had requested no onions- that was really good too!
The mango lassi is also huge and delicious. 

I wish I lived closer :("}
{"text":"Just stopped by for a quick lunch on the recommendation of a few friends. Ordered the Punjabi cheeseburger, 2 meat and 2 veggie Samosas nd my goodness, they were both SO GOOD. I'm lactose intolerant but the burger looked so good I had to- totally worth the stomach pains, the patty was homemade and the actual burger itself was huge!! The samosas were the best I've ever had (and trust me ya girl eats a lot of samosas), the crust was light, fluffyand crispy thinly sprinkled with flaky salt. I was going to ask for sauce but totally forgot since these were so delicious on their own (especially the meat one). Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Had such a great lunch! Butter chicken mac n  cheese, and a butter chicken samosa. The entire menu looks delicious, will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"Finally got to Rick's Good eats ... The name says it all .. owned by Rick and his wife... Food isn't good ... it's Awesome !!! 

We ordered the RFC - Fried chicken Burger with a twist and Rick recommended the Butter chicken loaded Fries over the Mac n' Cheese .... He did not Disappoint. The flavors of the East & the West definitely have been fused very well by Rick. The ambience in the restaurant was good and seemed busy around 8 p.m. 

He also took a few minutes to chat with us & take a few Selfies. Definitely coming back next time we visit Toronto !!!"}
{"text":"Loaded fries was good but everything is very pricey 
The biryani was the not that great didn't really had a flavour"}
{"text":"We were very happy with our order. Went because we were in the area and wanted to try something different.

A+ service, clean and trendy with great music. 

Food was great we had the loaded fries with butter chicken, the Mac and cheese with butter chicken and the cheeseburger and we loved all of it!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. I just happened to be in the area and found this place. The best sandwich/burger I've had. A must try, really."}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place, i decided to give it a try. Ordered 5 itmes:

T-Bolt: soooooo cheesy and good. This was one of  my favourites

Loaded fries with butter chicken: OMG soooooo good. Also my favourite

RFC: the portion of the fried chicken is humongous. This is a Serious chicken burger. Quite Delicious but  my 3rd fave.

Shahi Paneer Naanwich: super tasty for a veggie option. Tied for 3rd fave

Butter chicken mac and cheese: now, i dont know if its because i tried this last, but compared to the other 4 items which were packed with so much flavors and fresh red onions/cilantro/peppers etc, the mac and cheese tasted dull in comparison. Was good, but my least favourite."}
{"text":"Solid lunch spot although it can get very busy sometimes, so it doesn't work for lunch breaks all the time. Great good, great prices, great service. I usually get the RFC - it's solid. You won't be disappointed!

4 starts because I empathize with the Skip The Dishes & other drivers. While I was there, they were asked to wait a significant amount of time without an apology. Also the owner micro-manages the staff from what I saw."}
{"text":"My freakin' goodness, Rick's Good Eats (RGE) was better than I could have hoped for...

Maybe it helped that a family member was like \"Eh, it's fine...\" when I asked her about RGE; I had little in the way of expectations after that comment, so it was such a pleasant surprise to discover that RGE is fantastic. Also, I need to not listen to that family member anymore about food.

[] The Amazing []

+ The RFC. Rick's Fried Chicken is goooood. But maybe that's the Southern boy in me who just likes me some fried chicken, Indian-ized or otherwise.
+ T-BOLT. A Tandoori-styled BLT. This naanwich had no business being this delicious. It was amazing. And one of the cheaper options on the menu too.
+ Chaat Fries. YEEEEAAAAASSSSSSSS.

[] The Good []

+ Punjabi Cheeseburger. It was good. I actually don't have any complaints. It just wasn't as good as some of the other RGE stuff I tried.
+ Butter Chicken Mac n' Cheese. Honestly, this was probably the least impressive thing to me, especially considering that it's \"award-winning\" and whatnot. Don't get me wrong, it was good... But it's kinda one-note in terms of texture and flavor. Not a bad thing if you have other items to go with it, but if this had been the only thing I had from RGE, I would have probably been bored after a few spoonfuls. However, I'm just now realizing that I didn't have any of the coleslaw that came with the Mac n' Cheese, so that may have affected the overall dish.

[] The Bad []

Nothing. Nothing I had was bad. Honestly, if you find yourself unable to enjoy a single thing on the menu, you're probably a terrible and unhappy person, and you make everyone around you sad by your very existence.

[] The Summary []

I live approximately 2,000 miles (3,200 km for you Canucks) from this place, and I'm sad that I have to wait until the next time I'm in town to have more RGE. You Mississaugans don't even know what you have. Enjoy it on my behalf, you RGE-havin' jerks.

P. S. Stupid hours though. The first time we wanted to try RGE at around 8 pm, we discovered that they were already closed by 7:30 pm. Those are dumb, Oklahoma-run, \"I have to be in bed by 9 pm\" kinda business hours."}
{"text":"My colleague ordered from this place on UberEATS and it blew. my. socks. off. 

CAN WE TALK ABOUT THEM CHAAT FRIES?! 

So pretty much I stole all of my colleague's food that day and was forced to retire my diet for yet another day so that I can order up myself some oily potatoey goodness the day after. Unfortunately, I patiently waited on UberEATS for Rick's to open at 11:30, only to be told that \"this food establishment is currently unavailable\". So sad. Turns out they don't do UberEATS everyday, which is a bummer.

Moral of the story: if you want to fuel your chaat fries cravings, go straight to the source."}
{"text":"The Hungry Gills stopped by here last weekend. Rick's Good Eats is in a plaza that can easily be driven past, so we loaded it onto our GPS and made sure this was not going to happen.

Inside RGE
The place is very clean, music is upbeat, and everyone around the restaurant could not take their eyes off their food (with good reason). The menu was written on a chalkboard, and every dish was the definition of creative. 

Rick was manning the front counter, we didn't introduce ourselves as we didn't want to do a biased review--- but he was super polite, and greeted everyone with a smile and enthusiasm. (we'll say hi next time!!)


THE FOOD
I (Karn) ordered:
- Punjabi Cheese Burger ($9)
- Butter Chicken Loaded Masala Fries ($8)

Neetu ordered:
-Shahi Paneer Naanwich with a side of Masala fries ($13)


The Punjabi Cheese Burger consists of a 6oz beef patty, melted cheddar, tomato, onion, shredded lettuce, sauteed onion and achari mayo. The bun for this burger was LARGE and just the right texture for the burger patty. The patty itself wasn't much of a patty; more so a marinated kabob slab that was very tender and flimsy. This is not necessarily a bad thing, it just makes the process of eating it a bit messy as it breaks apart real quick. The flavours of the burger were delicious, especially the achari mayo! For those who don't know, achar is an Indian pickle, so the mayo has some kick with hints of Indian spices. I would recommend people to definitely try it out but make sure you eat it with discretion, it can get messy! 

The Butter Chicken Loaded Masala fries consists of masala fries, cheese, butter chicken, tomato, onion, jalapeno, achari mayo, crispy fried onions, and cilantro. This was a poutine on steroids! The flavours in this meal were unreal. Spicy jalapenos, crunchy fried onions, juicy tomatoes/onions and sweet butter chicken...WOW. I swear we got like 2lbs of delicious fries for only $8, amazing value!

The Shahi Paneer Naanwich consists of paneer (indian hard cheese) marinated with a buttery/creamy sweet sauce, tomato, onion, cheese, cilantro, sambal oelek and achari mayo. This was an absolute home run. Neetu didn't want to share it, it was THAT good! Obviously, she eventually shared, and we could not stop raving about how delicious this meal was. The Naan bread was so soft and fluffy, it complimented the creamy shahi paneer texture to perfection! This is a MUST-GET to all who visit RGE, please try it ---you will not be disappointed.

The Masala Fries are extra crispy fries seasoned with Indian street food spices. Absolutely surprised how the fries were able to have such a nice sounding crunch to them, while still giving off a tender and savory mouth-feel. Mouthfeel, is that even a term? who cares, RGE makes us do crazy things (like making up foodie terminology). Get em' on their own or loaded, cannot go wrong with any decision involving Masala Fries.

Overall, we spent ~$33. For the amount of food we got, this was a GREAT value. We were absolutely stuffed, actually had to bring some food home. 

We definitely recommend this place to any foodie!

{"text":"I had lunch here the other day and let me say I rarely eat Indian food but this place just got me hooked. Every bite was mouth watering and bursting with flavour. I definitely recommend this place to anyone that loves to experience their pallet being tantalized and their tummy satisfied.  
This is straight up from an Italian food connoisseur. Yep that's me."}
{"text":"This place has deliciously unique food! If you are a fan of fusion, you will love this place. I love their masala fries with Shahi paneer, samosa chaat, shahi paneer naan'wich was delicious as well. The dishes are enough to serve 1 person, although I end up sharing the appetizers anyways! Most of their menu is unhealthy/fast food, they do however have a Healthy-ish salad option. I love the fact that they have Gobi wings and their samosas are made fresh in house!"}
{"text":"The samosas are a must try! Their crispy dough is not like anything I've ever tried! Mmm! 

Also try out their butter chicken Mac and cheese, RFC ( ricks fried chicken), and the T-Bolt! I have also tried their biryani with butter chicken and mmmmmmmm! So good I just found it a little watery and there was a pool of liquid. I'm guessing it was the left over water from the rice or I could be wrong. 

You can dine in or take out! Friendly and fast service!"}
{"text":"Rick's eats are more than just good - it's Indian comfort food fusion at it's finest, coupling traditional eastern flavours with basic western comfort staples. It's genius, and in short, this place is more than good - it's fantastic.

First of all, this place is located in a random plaza in Mississauga where I'm almost never around - to give you an idea, it's about 10 minutes away from Heartland Town Centre (at around Courtneypark Drive and Kennedy Road). We came by on a Friday evening and it was pretty busy. The menu options are written on a chalkboard to your right as you walk in, and you'll notice that there's a good variety of items to choose from - from burgers, to fries, to samosas - but with a fusion twist!

We ordered the Butter Chicken Mac N' Cheese, the Butter Chicken Fries, and the Punjabi Cheeseburger. The Butter Chicken Mac N' Cheese was our favourite - if you like the sound of a soft, creamy, super savoury, carby dish coupled with the distinct and tasty flavours of flavourful, sweet and rich butter chicken, this is the dish for you. Incredibly comforting, and married the best of both recipes to create a really addicting, delicious dish. The fries were alright (as others have mentioned... YES, they taste and look exactly like Costco fries!), and the burger was tasty but was definitely messy to eat.

Overall, we would definitely come back here. A spot good for all ages, family-friendly, and has tables that can accommodate small groups. Plus, very interesting menu items at a reasonably price point! With tax and tip, we paid around $30."}
{"text":"Indian food meets North American food and makes delicious babies.  Tandoori bacon on a Punjabi burger, yum!  Masala fries are also delicious.   Burger is handmade, tandoori bacon is extra, but worth it.  They also have a BLT with said tandoori bacon.  Apparently the owner won Recipes to Riches for his butter chicken Mac and cheese, haven't tried it but it's on my to-try list.  Each day they have daily samosa features, and many vegetarian options.  I've been there four times and haven't been disappointed yet.

Interior is like a lunch counter, tables and seats are available and I've never had an issue with getting a seat.  Order at the counter and pick up food and self-service drink fridges.  There is an area with couches and comfy chairs as well, but I have never seen anyone sit there."}
{"text":"Fantastic and great twist on great Indian cuisine - and this place is brilliant and I'd be hard pressed to find anything not worthy of your time 

Butter chicken samosas - need I say more? 

Just go - really - it's that good ...."}
{"text":"Very good service and very good food. The staff is friendly. But be warned- it can be crowded. Not a lot of seating available."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely fantastic! It's like fast casual fusion, and everything I ordered was world-class delicious!!! I cannot recommend this place enough, go chow down and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing food friendly service great staff very helpful!! Will be back for more!!!! Butter chicken samosas awesome... tandoori cheeseburger wow!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem in Mississauga. We tried this place on my husbands birthday. Rick greeted us right away and helped us with our order. Everything we had was crazy good. Basically heaven in your mouth. We especially liked the T-Bolt and the Loaded Butter Chicken fries. Rick brought us over cheese cake samosas on the house. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"believe the hype!

mostly black decor with some wood.  the smell of indian spices is prevalent as soon as you walk in.  very appetizing already.  friendly staff as well.

i got the punjabi cheeseburger and was truly blown away.  crumbly beef patty with the spices contained within the beef mixture.  the achari mayo worked perfectly in here, with its tangy richness soothing some of the spicy heat.  truly a symphony of flavours in the mouth, which made it somewhat overwhelming, but it was an absolute pleasure to eat.  well worth the $9, especially because it's huge!  my friend ordered the biryani which was excellent as well - the flavours linger forever in the aftertaste.

overall, this is some innovative and delicious food, but never to the point of being outrageous or absurd.  i will most certainly be back here to try the rest of the menu.  you should too"}
{"text":"Greetings!! Went here today and was a little disappointed.  Employees were picking in their eyes /nose and yawning in their hands while making contact with food.  I understand the staff were young but......really.  The food was good. But I wouldn't return. We ordered the Jolt only because they were out of chicken wings.  And my awesome friend ordered the loaded fries and cauliflower wings which were good. They complimented us with a dish for their inconvenience for being out of the chicken wings."}
{"text":"Great spot with a contemporary take on Indian food. If you are looking for flavoured packed food with some great spices, this is the place to go! The pictures do it justice"}
{"text":"Everything is very good that I've eaten here. People are friendly.
My only wish is that could have more low card options beside the salad. I can usually navigate any restaurant to create low card meal. But as everything here is preset , it mostly carb heavy. 
However the food very good and eat it once in a while...  always enjoy it."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Had this for lunch yesterday and going back for dinner today. The staff were very friendly and the service was very fast. I tried the Punjabi burger and the jerk samosa and was blown away by how good they were. A must try."}
{"text":"This is THE spot for all y'all South Asian Mississauga hipsters. Good food, old school hip hop and R&B, couches, some photo ops for the 'gram... What more could a millennial ask for?

The masala fries with butter chicken were just about the best thing I've ever had. So much flavour and texture... The fries themselves were delicious, but topped with crispy onions, butter chicken, coriander and some creamy goodness? Sheesh... I think I have to go back right now and get some more. I also got the shahi paneer naanwich, which was delicious and full of flavour.

The food here is super creative and deliciously flavourful, the vibe is laid back and fun, and the staff are great. Love it."}
{"text":"Great good. Cool place.  Rick is a very nice and humble guy.  Congratulations on a successful place."}
{"text":"I will state off the bat that my experience with this company is limited to their Butter Chicken Lasagna that I bought in-store; this was quite delicious. Recently, I obtained a take-out dish of tandoori chicken salad, and I must say that I was disappointed overall (and that's being generous).

The takeout meal consisted of a salad of romaine lettuce (which was poorly cut), red onions, and jalapenos (why?!), in addition to shreds of tandoori chicken which appeared and tasted like leftover portions of tandoori chicken. It does come with fried onion pieces, although I asked for these on the side. When I tried them, they were not particularly appealing. The spicy dressing is probably the saving grace overall.

The rest of my group ordered the grilled shahi paneer naanwich (which was enjoyable overall), the punjabi cheeseburger with masala fries (unappealing). Additionally, the 'kachumber salad' that we were looking forward to, was overpriced and quite disappointing.

Overall, I am disappointed in this institution. I think the idea is unique and I wish them the best; however, the execution is lacking. A business can't simply focus on the items that set it apart, such as the Butter Chicken Lasagna, but must also put this degree of detail into every meal."}
{"text":"RGE will be a restaurant that I take friends and relatives too when they come to visit. The food was excellent. The flavour combinations we're really well done. I had the RFC with loaded fries and my wife had the dosa burger with a cucumber salad. The fries were enormous and  the cilantro with butter chicken and jalape√±o went really well together. The RFC was seasoned very well, kind of sweet but still spicy with what tasted like a peanut sauce. The dosa was great too, I really liked the mustard seed in the potato. Overall, excellent food, really fun menu, and a bunch of cool people who work there and ate excited about the food they're serving. Already planning to go back and try the other menu items."}
{"text":"Mississauga is stepping their food game up, far out of the Port Credit lakeshore this time. 

Rick, you made some really, really good eats. I get it, though; \"really\" and \"great\" don't roll off the tongue as nicely. 

My friend and I, self-proclaimed foodies, stepped into the oddity amongst the airport/industrial area, right beside a Tim Hortons in the middle of concrete and pavements. Having heard Yelpers and friends push us to take the time to come in, we followed the hype. A warm atmosphere, casual and fun. The black-wall menu added a hip touch to the room, not laden with decor, but open with a cozier area and a dining space. The music was reminiscent of a Toronto kid's CD Walkman, bumping with 2000s hip hop and dancehall. I could have danced there. I think I did, a bit. 

The ladies at the counter casually and warmly welcomed us. After much debate, we settled to try the Punjabi burger with Tandoori bacon, and the butter chicken mac and cheese. We got a side of masala fries and a meat samosa. After a 10-15 minute wait, the trays popped up by the hot table and we took the beauties to our seat. 

Punjabi burger: WOW. Take your classic American bacon cheeseburger and marry it with Indian flavour. The patty was moist and almost of a crumbling texture, bustling with flavour. I wish I knew North Indian flavour enough to articulate. A little less of the achari mayo and and more leafy vegetables would have helped cut through the depth of flavour. 

Butter Chicken Mac N' Cheese: For those of you who recall Rick's PC butter chicken lasagna, wait til you have it fresh. Creamy cheese carries Indian spices so well. The noodles were plentiful; the chicken could have been more present. With the spiced slaw on top almost as a palette freshener, it was alllll good. 

Masala fries: these must have been boiled, then double fried, because these were so soft and moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. The seasoning was incredible. Salty but with Indian flare. 

Samosa: Good grief this was good. I don't know if I can enjoy the common potato samosa as much anymore. The crisp chew of the thin dough, and the plentiful meat combination on the inside was incredible. 

I have to go back and try the rest of the menu, including those juices and dessert samosas. You've left me half full, in the sense that I was well-satisfied but craving for more. See you soon, Rick's (really, really) Good Eats."}
{"text":"First, I'd love to show you a picture of the food - but I honestly couldn't put my RFC sandwich down long enough to take my phone out!!  You walk in to a wall of glorious aroma and the decision on what to actually order is tough!  I want to try it all!  I settled on a RFC sandwich and a butter chicken samosa (samosa of the day). Both did not let me down in both the quality and quantity department!  The pastry for the samosa is amazing!  My coworkers ordered the butter chicken and rice and the loaded butter chicken fries. Both meals looked amazing and must've been as there wasn't a morsel left behind!  So good!"}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying Ricks Good Eats this past week with a friend and it was worth trying! Upon arriving here, I liked that there was no issue with finding parking spots despite how busy this restaurant got for 1:30 p.m. on a Tuesday. I also liked how it was a casual space with cafeteria style ordering, a bunch of tables that were mostly clean and it had a couch area for hanging out. 

We had a really hard time choosing what to get since there were so many great choices on the menu and I really wish I had room in my stomach to try everything. After talking to different staff members there who all enthusiastically gave us their input, we ended up getting the butter chicken loaded fries, the healthy-ish salad with tandoori chicken in it, samosa filled with lentils (forgot the official name for this) and the ras malai cheesecake samosa. Our order came out to about almost $24 with tax. 

The butter chicken loaded fries looked delicious, it was tasty overall and a good portion. I just wish it could have stayed warm longer as I found that it was cold within less than ten minutes of eating it. There were some good flavours in the healthy-ish salad that we got with tandoori chicken but some of the chicken pieces I ate were slightly over seasoned. The samosa filled with lentils was flavourful, filling and the shell was crispy. Last, the ras malai cheesecake samosa was delicious and not too sweet - for me, this one was the clear winner of the bunch! 

In terms of portions, we were more than full enough with what we ordered. By the time we were done eating, there was just under half of the butter chicken loaded fries left and we still had about one third of the salad left. It was all filling considering how hungry we were at the start of the meal. 

All in all, we had a good dining experience here and I would definitely consider coming back to try some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"This was a little different place then I thought. The menu is Pak-Indian cuisine. 

I had the Butter Chicken lunch special. With it came a Samosa & a small veggie salad. The Butter Chicken with Basmati rice was very tasty. The clucker quantity was a bit lacking (I had 4 pieces in my order). The rice was done just right. What stood out to me were two things
1. The Butter Chicken Samosa was outstandingly good. It was Crispy deliciousness & I wanted 3 more! 
2. The place was crowded with young school kids which made it very loud! Not the restaurants problem however. 

This was a solid lunch but is order a burger next time."}
{"text":"Great service & delicious food! 

I would definitely recommend the Chaat Fries, Gobi Wings, The Punjabi Cheeseburger & the famous Rasmalai Cheesecake Samosas"}
{"text":"Great fusion food, a new take on some popular Indian dishes - loved the biryani and the samosa dessert!"}
{"text":"Great place. Very interesting food. A cross between Indian and comfort food. Definitely recommended! Especially if you like spice ..."}
{"text":"I wondered how is it possible that a restaurant has over 40 reviews and still has 5 out of 5 stars? Now I know! They offer a unique spin on Indian cuisine, by combining it with traditional western dishes. Examples would be butter chicken infused Mac & cheese or tandoori bacon!"}
{"text":"Best. Punjabi & Western Fusion Food!!! The most yummiest, mouth watering, tummy filling food. Reasonable prices with HUGE portions!!! Love the staff, food and place!! Rick was able to come out and have a chat with us all! I recommend the Punjabi cheese burger with tandoori bacon!!!"}
{"text":"We had the Punjabi burger, butter chicken samousas and cauliflower wings. Simply amazing. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Note:  Not for someone on a diet!

Preetty good, preetty, preetty good!  Based on these reviews, I was a bit skeptical, but the flavours are definitely there.

If you're gonna visit, I'd recommend you come here with at least 1 other friend, so you can order different items to try.  My friend & I had the following combos:
-  The Go-To (Butter Chicken w/ Rice), they had run out of the Chicken Biryani + a choice of samosa + pop
-  Punjabi Cheeseburger w/ fries + pop

Both combos were $13ea.  (And yes, the fries taste like Costco fries as per Barbara's review!)  They are battered and were still crispy afterwards and I detected some slight seasoning (masala?) on them.

You can tell the patty for the cheeseburger is fresh, as opposed to frozen and it reminded me of koftas, but with slightly more Indian spices.  Bun was soft, no complaints.  Butter Chicken had a really good flavour, BUT rice was a bit watery at the bottom of the paper tray.

My friend choose the Jerk Chicken samosa 'cause it was something different and it was good, although I found it a bit on the salty side.  Samosa is a nibble, adequate when sharing and eating other things.  

Depending on your appetite and comparing to what you may get at a dumpy Indian place, you may find the portions on the smaller side.  I thought they were ok, especially for health-conscious millennials.  Butter Chicken consisted of 2-ok, but smaller portions, whereas Cheeseburger fit within the confines of a standard Dempster burger bun.  No leftovers here 'cept for the fries!

Points for uniqueness!  Would like to go back, but area is a bit out-of-the-way for me.  It's ~10mins NE of Heartland, but within 3mins NE of Cineplex Courtney Park."}
{"text":"Great Indian fusion food! Loved it. 
The mix and match of food have been done very carefully to bring out the best of East and West!
The Masala Fires and Dosa burger were unique and delicious. Their hot sauce is awesome. I nice quick eat out with a twist. 

I would go here again if I am around. I would suggest them to upgrade their service to match the prices and make this place more appealing.

My husband ordered some food from the menu which also had the description of ingredients, however, they added yogurt on it which was not mentioned, when he asked them to changer as he is allergic to it, they were pretty resistant and were not ready to accept the mistake of not mentioning it and replace the order. They need to work on their service.
However later the owner came and replced the order."}
{"text":"I tried their RFC chicken sandwich which was tasty and humongous together with fries. The interiors and ambience are well done but the place was packed."}
{"text":"The food was so amazingly good! Saw a post on insauga and we decided to check it out. We were so glad we did! The fries are out of this world. Do yourself a favour and get the chaat or masala fries. The rasmalai cheesecake samosas are to die for!! Place is rather small if you want to sit down and enjoy your food. We took ours to go as it was too crowded at that time."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place yet, you have not lived. It is a hidden little gem right by Courtney Park. The food, prices, atmosphere.. THE FOOD!!! Everything was just spectacular. The butter chicken samosas will change your life. Recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great burger, loved the loaded fries. The samosas were passable though, came in at room temperature. Will be visiting again for the burger and the fries.
Had an issue with billing... They don't give out a receipt for your purchase, even if you ask for one. After I had placed the order, i had a feeling I was overcharged so I went back to the counter and asked for a receipt. Turns out they don't give one, the only option was to have one sent to my email, so I entered my email in their system, so never received the receipt. Don't want to make a big deal so don't bother to go back to the counter and confront. So just keep an eye while ordering i guess."}
{"text":"We ordered the Chicken Biryani, Butter Chicken Mac & Cheese, and two Butter Chicken samosas for a lunch takeout. Cost us about $27 to upgrade both entrees to a meal which means you get a samosa and a pop. 

The best thing out of our entire meal were definitely the samosas. The pastry in the samosas was crunchy, not too bread-y, and delicious. I've never had samosas like those before! Definitely glad we ordered them. The Mac & Cheese was okay... everyone in the reviews seem to really like it but maybe it's better as a side dish instead of a main entree. It didn't seem particularly flavourful nor was it that cheesy. Maybe it would have been better if we ate it right away, who knows. The biryani was pretty standard. We liked the casual atmosphere and the fusion aspect of their dishes but weren't blown away... well, the samosas are enough on their own to merit four stars. Oh man, those were good. So on the samosas alone, I'm sure we'll be back the next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Awesome food and atmosphere! The Dosa Burgers and fries were amazing! Definitely a spot to not miss when in the GTA!  :)"}
{"text":"Amazing little place. Menu the way I like it, small with everything done incredibly well. The Punjabi Cheeseburger and the T-Bone are a must, as well as the Marsala Fries and Butter Chicken Mac 'n' Cheese. Don't leave workout trying the dessert samosas. Really friendly staff."}
{"text":"A few days ago, I got a question from my manager, asking whether our team should do a lunch on Friday before Christmas. I was game. He asked for a restaurant suggestion, as he claimed that I am good with this task. I am thinking that it's more his being sluggish on a Tuesday afternoon.

I have had Rick's Good Eats bookmarked for some time. It was time to put it out there. I got the go-ahead from him, my intern, and my fellow colleagues on my team. Yay!

We got there on Friday afternoon just after 1 pm. The tables were all taken. However, my manager had spotted one group that was about to leave. 

He then proceeded to ask me what I was getting. I told him that I was more focused on getting our table first. He had meandered over to the huge menu that seems to be on a massive black chalkboard. I didn't want any distractions.

I thanked the group of three folks who were leaving. I swooped over to the table and put my stuff down. My boss tore himself from the menu and started wiping the table clean. 

It always amazes me how prepared I am with looking at the menu before I come. My two colleagues did the same thing. My boss? He was completely unprepared!

I ordered the butter chicken mac and cheese that is topped with coleslaw. I made it a combo by getting a chicken pot pie samosa and a Diet Coke. My colleague ordered the same thing, except that she got a different drink. She is a coleslaw connoisseur and, like me, finds mac and cheese comforting.

My intern is a hearty eater. She went with the Punjabi hamburger, loaded fries with butter chicken, and cheesecake samosas. Our manager ordered the pataka wings that came with fries.

The owner came up to our table and indicated that he had to boil a new batch of macaroni. He advised that our orders would take thirteen minutes. We were okay with the wait. I suggested that he bring out the other two food orders, so our other colleagues wouldn't be starving. He mentioned that he would also bring out our chicken pot pie samosas while we waited for our mac and cheese. Nice!

The chicken pot pie samosa was out-of-this-world good! If I could find a decent mountain in Mississauga to scream out how yummy it was, I would have. Sadly, the city doesn't have one, unless I built one with the snow that we have.

My intern shared her loaded fries with butter chicken with me. They were incredibly delicious! I need to order them the next time. She was also enjoying her Punjabi burger. It was huge and looked so good.

My boss had the pataka wings. He first commented on number of wings that he got, which was six. He was expecting a pound to be eight wings. I had indicated that they were large and he got fries. The wings had cilantro on them, which he doesn't like and spent time scraping them off. I also need to give these wings a try down the road.

At long last, our butter chicken mac and cheese had arrived, with a huge ball of creamy coleslaw on it. Oh my word, is this dish ever scrumptious! My colleague inhaled her coleslaw. She saved half her mac and cheese to take home, for she got full fast. The portion is deceiving. It looks small, but it is filling with the mac and cheese, and the chunks of butter chicken in it.

It took me a bit of time to eat it all. I was determined and succeeded. So good!

I highly recommend coming here. The flavours are incredible. The food is both creative and yummy.

{"text":"This place was phenomenal! Recommend this place to anyone.  
We were on our way home from the airport and wanted to stop and grab something to eat.  It's by chance that we decided to stop and boy are we glad we did.

We had:
Dosa Burger 
Punjabi Cheese Burger 
Butter chicken mac and cheese
Chaat Fries
Gobi Wings

The flavors were so well thought out and complimented each other perfectly.  typically with fusion there are some hits and misses with ideas but honestly every dish inspired us to try another.

We were so impressed we asked if the owner was on site just so we could compliment him on how amazing this place was.  He promptly came over and had a conversation with us.  You could tell that he loves this business and he cares about the feedback you offer.  He was so engaged in the conversation.   This is the type of business you feel good about supporting. 

Thank you Rick!

{"text":"Trinity restaurant in a random quiet Plaza in Mississauga, just on the edge of Brampton.

I got there just before 1 p.m. on a quiet Saturday but within another 30 minutes the place was packed.  I have the loaded fries. It was incredible. Very tasty. My friend who doesn't like to try different in you Foods had the punjab burger and she really enjoyed it.

They had 90's hip hop and R&B playing which was super cool.

The food was pretty reasonably priced for what it is.  

The cheesecake Samosa was not that great. Maybe if it had more cheesecake in it and if it was sweeter.

Unfortunately the meat is not halal.... *sad face.  Maybe that will change one day."}
{"text":"Tried Rick's Good Eats this past Tuesday after hearing great things from friends and family.  I was not disappointed. Had the Dosa Burger and Fries and the great flavours were balanced perfectly and it was a delicious lunch.  So good in fact we returned several times this week and we're thoroughly impressed every single time. Jerk Chicken & Butter Chicken Samosas are unbelievably addictive & the Butter Chicken to go was delicious as well. We'll definitely be regulars here. No doubt about it. Can't wait to try the Punjabi Cheeseburger on my next visit. DEFINITELY recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Ugh! I was just so disappointed because I was so excited to try this place out!!!!

I ordered the butter chicken mac n cheese, punjabi cheeseburger, jerk chicken samosa, paneer fries and the rasmalai cheesecake samosa....basically the whole menu because I was that excited!! The flavour was all there, it tasted great!

But it made my stomach hurt whyyyyyyy. This never happens to me!  I thought it was just me but when I asked my boyfriend if his stomach was hurting too he said yes! That was all we ate that day so it couldn't have been anything else.  

Although the food tasted great, I don't think I'll be returning.  Sorry Rick, I really wanted to like you.

P.s. Shout out to the server hitting on my boyfriend while I was right beside him, I see you ;)"}
{"text":"Wow! Had the Punjabi burger and my oh my was that amazing! The bacon was thick and juciy with a tandoori flavour, the meat was tender and the bun alongside the cheese and the sauces brought this burger together very well. Will be back tomorrow. Hahah."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Indian fusion food I've ever had!!! I've been waiting to come eat here since this place opened. I was finally able to come all the way  from Chandler,AZ USA to satisfy my  palette. My expectations were exceeded this past Saturday evening. Also had some friends from France and California who came and everyone enjoyed their meals. We had Punjabi cheeseburgers, Naan which, Masala fries, Chaat fries, Gobi wings, jerk Samosa Dosa Samosa cheesecake samosa. Do yourself a favor if you're in the area and eat here. I can't wait to my next Canada Trip to return to Rick's Good Eats. The staff was very friendly too :-)"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Went twice on a recent trip to Toronto and tried several items. Luckily enough to get the last two jerk chicken samosas on day 2, but also had my Gobi Wings order accidentally stolen by another in my party! So at least I know what I'm ordering next time.

The burgers are huge and if you opt to go Chaat on the Masala fries prepare for a lot of food. This is not healthy food in any stretch of the imagination, but the flavors are potent and blend excellently. Worth treating yourself. Twice at least."}
{"text":"I ordered the salad for take out, do NOT make my mistake! It was just a burger patty slapped on a tiny bed of dry shredded iceberg lettuce and a few diced tomatoes, no sauces, very pathetic.  Extremely disappointing.  I was so hungry but then angry so I ended up just throwing it out.
The owner said they would refund me but I would have to go back for that which I do not think will be happening anytime soon. 
On a side note, the guys with me that ordered other dishes were happy."}
{"text":"This place is really unique! Fusion of fast food with Indian makes for funky great tasting food :)

We had the Punjabi burger, loaded masala fries and their daily special samosa. All were very good! Next time I'll be trying one of their butter chicken fusion dishes. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Write the name of this place down because it's one you definitely need to try. This guy has got something special going here. 

I've had the Punjabi burger (with tandoori bacon) and the loaded butter chicken fries. Holy. Smokes. 

Forget everything you think know about a great burger. Each burger you've consumed in your life have all just been training exercises for this main event, the Punjabi burger. Your whole life has been a lie up to this point. You have been living in darkness. Now let this Punjabi burger bring you light. It will singlehandedly change your life. 

Oh and the fries are just as good. An absolute must"}
{"text":"I would have given Ricks a 4 star review if not for the low and rather lack lustre level of service. 
We got there at 12:30 pm on a Saturday afternoon to a somewhat empty restaurant so the staff wasn't very busy at all. 
We ordered the dosa burger combo with the chaat fries. 
Let me start by saying that the food was absolutely delicious however a failing grade to the level of customer service. We had asked for the burger to be cut into two but was told by the person taking the order that the kitchen wouldn't do it because of 'hygiene issues'. Why? Are your kitchen knives dirty? Is the kitchen not clean? That excuse would have better been stated as, 'we are lazy and don't want to'. A staff member was eating behind the counter and then handling the food as it came out of the kitchen. The staff was very polite and nice but did seem quite lazy. 
The dosa burger was so good. It had a potato patty that was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with just the right seasoning and spices. The chaat fries were battered fries that had what I will describe as an Indian salsa on top with possibly tamarind sauce. Oh so good! 
Food: 8.5/10
Customer service: 4/10
This place would be full if their service was better."}
{"text":"Probably the best food I've had in a while! We had Mom's Biryani, Punjabi Cheeseburger, Masala Fries and the Jerk Chicken Samosa. Each and every thing we ordered had great flavour and was amazing. But the Mom's Biryani was especially great! Definitely a must- eat!"}
{"text":"Listen here - You know the food is LEGIT when you walk into the joint and it smells like your ma's kitchen. The team at this restaurant can SLAY it in the kitchen. They've got decent seating and its got this cool , laid back vibe - with couches in a corner and just standard seating. Food was bloody amazing! You almost want to take things to go if you're like me - so you can get dirty with the dishes once the meal is over - you know that curry residue should NEVER be WASTED! Ordered the Loaded Butter Chicken Poutine and this right here will change your life - this may be funny while you read. But Read that again - IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE ! Had the Punjabi Cheeseburger, fantastic - the burger is a meat pattie, I wish it had that burger BITE to it, Its like a meat cutlet with tandoori flavors in it. Had the Masala Dosa Burger and was BLOWN AWAY - now this is a fusion of some exceptional flavors and that burger MESSES with your brain - cos you want to have that DOSA in a THALI plate, but holding it like a burger is just WILD and LOVABLE. Cos even a Masala Dosa burger wants to be LOVED. This is a spot I'll be visiting frequently and look forward to meeting with Legend Rick."}
{"text":"The place is a cute little restaurant in a commercial area.  There is limited seating but we went for an early dinner on a Saturday night and we managed to grab the last table big enough to seat 5.  This is a fusion restaurant mixing American favorites like burgers, fries and Mac and Cheese with Indian flavours like butter chicken and tandoori.  We ordered samosas (jerk as well as butter chicken flavors) and they were quite flavorful.  I don't really eat spicy foods but the butter chicken was a great balance of heat and flavor.  Jerk was spicier but still yummy.  The Punjabi burger and RFC (fried chicken burger) had a good combination of spices.  Note that the burgers are quite large in size.  We also got the loaded fries and Mac and Cheese which were huge!  We also got the T-bolt which it's like a BLT on naan bread with sauces.  We shared everything so it got pretty messy but considering portion sizes ordering any one of the dishes is enough for one person.  We did a combo on the Punjabi burger with loaded fries.  If you order a combo it's +$4 but if you make it loaded fries that's an additional +$5 on top of the +$4.  But that combo would be enough for 2.  The foods were all really rich and filling.  The service though, was great! They were really friendly, asked us how we found the food and were very patient with us when we inquired about the bill."}
{"text":"Amazing. Portion sizes are generous. As I am Canadian with Punjabi origin this place reminds me of my childhood when my mom on busy days would pack me Indian food for lunch and i would swap portions with my (non Indian) classmates. But unlike most fusion foods these days which make you go '... Err ok?' this culinary creations are such masterfully blended. Every bite has purpose. Staff is super friendly and this place is GREAT to fill up on before a movie down the street"}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. Rick is a mastermind with this place. I used to watch his recipe videos on YouTube. But, the food here is delicious. Probably some of the most appetizing unique Indian food one can have.

My favourites: Dosa Samosa, Shahi Panner Fries Supreme (limited time offer), Punjabi Cheeseburger, Butter Chicken Mac n' Cheese."}
{"text":"Interesting and unique fusion food. Come here if you're looking for some ultimate comfort food (and don't mind knocking back some calories)

Had the shahi paneer fries which I loved - I'm a huge fry fan in general and this just took it to the next level. Generous amount of paneer - definitely not skimping on portion size. Also tried the dosa burger - hard to eat because the patty fell apart right away. 

Interesting vibe with the music and decor. Unexpected given the industrial location."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Rick's! As a brown girl, this gets the stamp of approval from me in the authenticity department. Rick's does a great job of mixing traditional desi flavours with the fast foods we all love. The T-bolt and Masala fries are my go to orders. I always end up coming here with my boyfriend. He's from Markham and always needs his fix when he comes down. They've got friendly staff, great tunes, and really cool merch. The only down side is the lack of seating but that's a minor setback in the big picture. If you're trying to introduce someone to Indian flavours without going all in, Rick's is the place to go."}
{"text":"What to try?!?

Their burgers or naanwich are good to start off if you haven't been here before. We also tried their daily special of their tandoori wings which tasted amazing!!

Really neat business idea to have the burgers with an Indian twist. 

They had masala fries too which came with the wings. The fries reminded me of Costco fries!! I love Costco fries so obviously I loved the fries too. I don't think I can really taste the masala spice in the fries though unless masala is suppose to taste like nothing much? But I think if the fries had more flavor to it..it would be a bomb sellout. You can of course opt for their loaded fries too if you want to spice it up with butter chicken or shahi paneer. 

We ordered the butter chicken macaroni and cheese as well. This came from their hot table meaning it's already pre made and ready to go if you are in a hurry. I really liked the flavor of the mac and cheese however I don't like the macaroni's consistency though. I thought it was a bit over cooked. I would assume so since it was sitting in the hot tray for a long time. It would be better if the mac was a better texture, that would taste great! 

One thing to note here is that their portion sizes for the loaded fries and the hot table items are huge. They are very generous with their portions and the price isn't too expensive for the food here! 

Last tip? 

Try their freshly mixed mango pulp and yogurt with the meal! Won't be disappointed. Sit tight because there is a bit of a wait(~15 min) for that goooodness because it usually will take some time for them to prepare your meal!"}
{"text":"Amazing.  Do it.  Areas looks a bit sketchy but the food is incredible - like nothing you've tried before.  Perfect blend of Canadian and Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"Although the food here is good, slightly above average it is still expensive. 17$ and change it got their famous cheeseburger, a small butter chicken French fries and a Coke."}
{"text":"This place offers a modern take on Indian food that is really impressive. You can pick from a variety of vegetarian options and completely forget that what you're eating is just veggies... The spices are bold and plentiful, and the brilliant concoctions served up are unlike the usual offerings of traditional Indian restaurants. The only reason I won't commit to five stars is that our dining experience was slightly odd... It was 1:00 in the afternoon and they were blasting super-raunchy R&B... The kind that would make you blush... But the burger and fries were out of this world, so yeah, I'd definitely go back. The food is inventive and delicious, and almost confusing. In a very good way."}
{"text":"This place was so good, we went back twice in one week! 

Ordered: 
Cheeseburger samosa, butter chicken mac and cheese, Punjabi cheeseburger, butter chicken fries, chaat fries, tandoori BLT, fried chicken sandwich and rasmalai samosa.

Everything tasted like really good but we did find the tandoori bacon to be a bit too salty. We also tried the dosa samosa as our order got mixed up and they let us keep both. It was really good.

Our favourite was the Punjabi cheeseburger, hands down. I also really liked the rasmalai samosa. 

My only wish was for the butter chicken mac and cheese to have been a side dish. It's really rich and was too much as an entree."}
{"text":"Easily one of the best restaurants ive ever been to, the food is fresh and very tasty, and great mix between indian flavors and american comfort food. My only hope is that they keep up their amazing quality even as their demand increases. Must tries are the butter chicken and jerk chicken Samosas, and their butter chicken mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Indian fast food with a twist. Be prepared to eat out of paper plates. Service was fine. A bit pricey."}
{"text":"I've been to Rick's a few times and every time it's been stellar. They do fast food items with an Indian twist. Dont mistake their fast food for being just fast food, cause this is top notch stuff.  They have a relatively small menu but it's perfect.  Sometimes less is more, because everything I've ordered has been great. Last time I got the T-bolt and masala fries with paneer. Always get the fries, always. Perfection. The T-bolt is an Indian take on the BLT. A naanwich with tandoori bacon. Delicious! But those fries are the showstopper, for me."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere & the food tastes great. We were greeted by Mandy who was very pleasant and extremely helpful with recommending what dishes we may enjoy. The fries were really crispy and not to oily, and the paneer was too good!! We also had the nanwich and the cauliflower wings.  (Hubby thought there was too much paneer...but how can you complain about too much paneer? lol) the food quality was superb and the staff was beyond amazing. Would definitely recommend this place for a fusion of Canadian and Indian food."}
{"text":"This place is jammed with great dishes and awesome flavour. Great for small groups for lunch or a quick bite. Try one of the many sandwich/burger options or you can try the samosas and chips. The sauce is made in house, and the ingredients are fresh and organic. Was intrigued by the menu and I am glad I came to check it out.

Located right off Kennedy near the 410. You'll be wanting to make this a staple part of your eating out scene once you try Rick's food!"}
{"text":"Excellent place as most reviews suggest. We ordered the butter chicken loaded fries and shahi paneer nanwich. Amazing taste and very very fresh.
However wish they had more chicken in the loaded fries."}
{"text":"The most amazing Indian food I have ever encountered. I have tried almost everything on the menu. It all blows my mind. Definitely worth the drive from New York City. I wish there were more vegan options without compromising the texture - like tofu and vegan mayo on Loaded Fries, instead of chicken and cream.  Aside from that, it is worth getting a vegan hall pass for #RGE."}
{"text":"Wow. So glad we tried this place for lunch. I had the butter chicken mac and cheese and it was awesome!  Big chunks of chicken in a nice sauce. Also had the samosas - great flavour/filling and the wrapping/crust was the best I've had - tasted homemade. My friend had Rick's c
Chicken Sandwich and was impressed as well. Excited to try the Punjabi Cheeseburger next time."}
